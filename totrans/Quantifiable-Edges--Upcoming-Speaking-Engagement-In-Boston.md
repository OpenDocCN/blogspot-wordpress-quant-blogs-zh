For those readers who happen to be in the Boston area I thought I’d let you know that I will be giving a presentation at the next

[Boston Investors’ Group](http://www.meetup.com/BostonIBD/)

meeting on Wednesday, June 24th.

The meeting will take place at MIT. It is free and open to the public, although the organizers request that you RSVP. More information, including a tentative agenda, may be found using the link below:
