    investigated autocopulas for underlying and hedge instruments as applied to [proxy
    / cross hedging](https://quantivity.wordpress.com/2011/10/02/proxy-cross-hedging),
    concluding the existence of *large-magnitude temporal volatility clustering*.
    This is indeed a known stylized fact of financial returns (see [Tsay 2010](http://books.google.com/books?id=OKUGARAXKMwC),
    Chapters 2 and 3).'

    for returns and volatility respectively. Yet, therein lies a practical problem
    faced by hedge analysis: *necessity to select a model with optimal parameters
    and error distribution for underlying and hedge*. This post describes and implements
    such [model selection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_selection) for choosing
    a model from the universe of standard parameters and non-normal error distributions.'

    that any *stationary* stochastic process can be represented by an ![\text{ARMA}(0,\infty)](img/3009b4de1f75918f07dfeaa769c60c85.png),

    recalling is any model whose absolute parameter values are less than 1 is weakly
