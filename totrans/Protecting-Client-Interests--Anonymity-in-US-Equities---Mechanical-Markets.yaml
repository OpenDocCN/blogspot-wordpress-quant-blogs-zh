    handling chain has a responsibility to protect traders’ identities. Still, there
    are plenty of exceptions to anonymous trading in US equities. When is it OK for
    brokers and exchanges to reveal potentially client-identifying information? In
    this post I will discuss a few situations where trading is not fully anonymous,
    briefly outline an HFT strategy that relies on one of these situations, as well
    as ask some related ethical questions.

    In the previous posts, we examined order characteristics in an effort to identify
    desirable trading partners. In keeping with that spirit, the first thing we’ll
    explore is the performance of Nasdaq trades identifiable by counterparty MPID
    (Market Participant ID).

    than those marked anonymous. This tendency is robust across stocks with different
    liquidity profiles (e.g. price, spread, volume). We’ve discussed in earlier posts
    why the supposedly efficient market has not eliminated this type of disparity.
    A gut reaction might be: “Wow, UBS is handling their customers’ orders poorly
    if they lose that much money when they trade.” I don’t know on whose behalf these
    orders are generally sent, but it’s a reasonable guess that they’re retail-type
    clients. Before you say: “typical bank, screwing over the least sophisticated
    customers,” I’d argue that UBS might be doing exactly the right thing as far as
    their clients are concerned. If these are orders from less sophisticated individuals,
    they might well be limit orders with the price chosen by the client instead of
    the broker; in which case all the client wants is to maximize their probability
    of being executed at the price submitted, without regard for what happens in the
    minutes afterward. By posting them to Nasdaq with the MPID field populated, UBS
    is essentially putting a giant “hit me” sign on these orders, which should get
    them a better fill rate, even if the rest of the market is making money off them.
    Counterintuitive as it may seem, what would be more concerning would be if these
    orders, instead of performing poorly, actually performed unusually well relative
    to the market. That would imply that their broker was leaking information to the
    market by flagging these orders with their MPID, presumably not in the customer’s
    interest.'

    if it actually has a poor fill rate and as soon as it’s posted to Nasdaq the price
    starts to move away from it? Just to be sure this isn’t what’s happening, here
    is a chart of the market price around the time of submission of said orders, when
    they are submitted within 10 cents of the NBBO. [[1](#bottom)]

    their MPID to the market (see “Edge Attribution Incentive Program” [here](http://www.bats.com/us/equities/membership/fee_schedule/edgx/)).
    Unfortunately, DirectEdge charges extra for a subscription to its MPID attributed
    order data, so I don’t have it available to repeat the analysis for EdgeX. But
    I would be very curious to see if orders associated with any particular MPIDs
    have unusual properties, particularly if they perform well versus the market.
    If so, that would suggest (and of course this is speculation) the possibility
    that a broker is willing to leak market-impacting client data in exchange for
    the revenue offered by DirectEdge. Again, I’m not saying this is happening on
    Edge, but this sort of incentive program is fraught with danger and I can’t help
    but wonder why it’s even offered. [[2](#bottom)]

    that capitalize on analogous low-alpha orders. The basic idea here is that when
    we see a UBSS order trade, we send orders trying to trade with any quantity remaining.
    The below simulation simply does that, sending 1000 share orders on stocks above
    30$/shr to mop up the quantity available. Note that the profit margins are about
    the same if we send 100 or 1000 share orders, which does hint that these (typically
    large) UBSS orders come from retail clients.

    average trade size of 250 shares, netting 10k/day (assuming minimal exit costs).
    Another 5k/day can be had by sending identical orders to EdgeX. And there’s potential
    for more; the volume can be scaled much higher by submitting the orders at a more
    aggressive price. This strategy is somewhat latency-sensitive and there’s a noticeable
    uptick in volume 50us after a UBSS order executes, suggesting that someone is
    wise to the MPID feature.

    of their senders. Orders displaying fewer HFT-like characteristics make for desirable
    counterparties. Now we see that knowing the broker’s identity also can tell us
    a great deal about the client. Imagine how much we might make if we knew the broker
    for every order we encountered!

    some dark pools openly advertise that they filter out toxic counterparties or
    allow users to choose which sub-population of the pool they’d like to interact
    with (and we’ve seen Barclays get into trouble over their claims of this kind
    with respect to their dark pool). It’s my understanding that internalizers can
    see some identifying characteristics of incoming orders. The general idea behind
    that identification is that it can result in clients receiving a better price
    on their executions. A market order sent via Charles Schwab may look a lot like
    a noise trader to Getco and could get executed near the midpoint; another order
    sent from Goldman immediately afterwards may scare them and won’t get executed
    at all.

    consideration. Instead of passing on their market-making revenue to the Schwab
    client through NBBO improvement, what if some of it were diverted to Schwab itself
    via payments for order flow? In that case Schwab might have an incentive to share
    information with Getco that might not always be in the client’s interest. Could
    Schwab reveal anything that might indicate to the internalizer that the order
    was sent not from your grandparents’ IRA, but by an executive exercising stock
    options? Remember from our examples that even mundane information like a timestamp
    or size can clue us in to who might have sent an order, so Schwab could even unwittingly
    transmit sensitive data. I have no reason to believe Schwab does so, but it’s
    a thought that could make investors uncomfortable. [[3](#bottom)]

    even if clients’ interests are looked after meticulously, de-anonymization of

    traders can receive better prices with their identities partly revealed, orders
    remaining fully anonymous will tend to come from large institutional traders.
    You could argue that this is exactly what’s happened to today’s markets; retail
    flow goes through internalizers and institutions are left to fight each other
