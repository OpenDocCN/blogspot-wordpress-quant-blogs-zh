    of decisions, the friends who will serve you best are those who understand your
    feelings but are not overly impressed by them.

    we put far more weight on what we may lose than on what we may gain.

    small probabilities of big gains, as opposed to avoiding things with potentially
    large losses.  Most really bad investments, those with the lowest expected returns,
    are things with large potential losses (lottery tickets, horse races, highly volatile
    stocks, options, penny stocks, etc.)  This means people don''t avoid them too
    much, rather, they prefer them too much.'

    picking up pennies in front of a steam roller, the kind of trade Kahneman's good
    friend Nassim Taleb argues is too common, where one basically sells insurance
    or options too cheap, making money most of the time but then occasionally blowing
    up and moving on to the next sucker.  Kahneman seems highly respectful of Taleb's
    work, and neither try and reconcile these ideas, even though they are really at
    the top for both.  That makes them more like interesting magazine writers (eg,
    Carl Zimmer, John Horgan) than scientists.

    to riffs on its opposite.  I think people who love quoting him merely because
    once you allow irrationality in equilibrium, you are no longer constrained, and
    Kahneman gives one the authority to do this.  So, as much as I enjoy many things
    he says, I'd say he has been an enabler of sloppy thinking, net net.
