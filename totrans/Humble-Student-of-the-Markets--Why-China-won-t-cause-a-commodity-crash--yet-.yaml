    are so-called “conservatives.” In the Chinese context, this means they are not
    predisposed to stopping the backward drift evident in Beijing since the middle
    of 2006\. Then, Hu Jintao began to undo the legacy of Deng Xiaoping, whose transformational
    policies were encapsulated by the phrase “reform and opening up.”

    reasons, but it became China’s new paradigm because it had the support of what
    David Shambaugh calls the “Iron Quadrangle,” state-owned enterprises, the security
    apparatus, the People’s Liberation Army, and Communist Party conservatives. “The
    coalition of these four power interest groups ‘captured’ Hu, who was too weak
    and disinclined to stand up to them, and they stalled reforms,” writes the noted
    George Washington University professor. Others define the constituent elements
    of the conservatives differently—many identify “powerful families” as being inside
    this circle of power, for instance—but ***it’s clear that entrenched interests
    now dominate politics in the Chinese capital.***

    Party (PAP) remains dominant, though that appears to be changing. The others evolved
    into multi-party democracies during the middle-income transition. China, too,

    legitimacy by delivering inclusive growth and equality of opportunity in a multi-ethnic
    society, and by eliminating corruption of all kinds, including cronyism and excessive
    influence for vested interests. ***What Singapore’s founder, Lee Kwan Yew, and
    his colleagues and successors understood is that the combination of single-party
    rule and corruption is toxic. If you want the benefits of the former, you cannot

    that can have potentially catastrophic effects.” The science of kleptocracy separates
    the behavior into two basic types: “developmental corruption” of the kind we see

    of cash from the private sector. As a result, whereas dirty money was an integral
    part of the developmental success in South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan, in China
    corruption fits the classic definition — the misuse of public authority for private

    It will eventually slow growth and the commodity supercycle will crash. In the
    short run, the composition of the current leadership suggests that it will continue
    to try to stimulate through more of the same, such as infrastructure projects,
    in order to boost growth. This will mean that commodity demand will continue -
    for now. At some point in the future, the global economy will turn down. When
    that happens, the Chinese economy will experience a crash landing, i.e. negative
    GDP growth, rather than the crash landing (sub-par GDP growth) that investors
    fear.
