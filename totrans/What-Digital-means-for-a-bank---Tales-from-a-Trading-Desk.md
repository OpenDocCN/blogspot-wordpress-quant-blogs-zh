## What Digital means for a bank

Two interesting articles on ING agile/digital transformation:

What digital means:

> We’ve digitized our processes to make transactions clear and easy for our customers. We’ve invested heavily in channels and touchpoints with our customers, introducing mobile and other technologies so that we can offer our services 24/7, anytime, anywhere. We’ve invested in analytics and in getting a 360-degree view of customers to better empower them to make important decisions about their financial assets.

Changing the HR process:

> Our HR processes weren’t fit for that purpose, so two years ago, we looked outside—specifically, at Netflix and what they were doing. We found the five-stage [Dreyfus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition#Dreyfus_Model) model,4 which is based on observable behaviors, not the number of diplomas you have. It measures how you acquire knowledge, how you apply it, and how you transfer it across teams and the organization. We defined our own five stages of IT-engineering performance. We involved the engineers themselves in this process. We asked them which areas of knowledge and which competencies they would expect themselves and their peers to have at various levels of maturity.

On silos:

> As long as you continue to have different departments, steering committees, project managers, and project directors, you will continue to have silos—and that hinders agility

Onboarding:

> one important initiative has been a new three-week onboarding program, also inspired by Zappos, that involves every employee spending at least one full week at the new Customer Loyalty Team operations call center taking customer calls. As they move around the key areas of the bank, new employees quickly establish their own informal networks and gain a deeper understanding of the business
