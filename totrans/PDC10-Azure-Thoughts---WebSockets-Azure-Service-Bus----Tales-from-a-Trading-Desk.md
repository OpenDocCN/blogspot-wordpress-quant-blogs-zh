## PDC10 Azure Thoughts – WebSockets Azure Service Bus?

[Maor](http://blog.maordavid.com/complete-list-of-all-the-pdc-2010-windows-azure-announcements/) has the list of Azure PDC10 announcements. The Remote Desktop access is nice, and will be extremely useful, coupled with Java as a first-class citizen on Windows Azure will make Azure a much more interesting place.

The [Service](http://vincenthomedev.wordpress.com/category/azure/) [Bus](http://vasters.com/clemensv/2010/10/29/PDC10+Windows+Azure+AppFabric+Service+Bus+Futures.aspx) get some nice [coverage](http://player.microsoftpdc.com/Session/1f7d009e-29cb-4a15-a1bf-91ffd115c54d) at PDC10\. So I assume we’ll see a [WebSocket](http://dev.w3.org/html5/websockets/)‘s for the Service Bus at some point (Push notifications as per the slides)?

With the addition of durable message buffers, listener load balancing and the push notifications (slide 20) allow we to build a Single Bank Platform (SBP) with the Azure Service Bus rather than use one of the existing streaming service products I’ve blogged about previous?
