    The first is a board or the staff of a fund, whether pension, endowment or other,
    to consider socially responsible investing for political reasons. Unless the owners
    of the fund have explicitly specified a social theme to the investing process
    as part of the investment mandate, the board could be in breach of their fiduciary
    responsibility for venturing into socially responsible investing, as such an approach
    is likely to deliver inferior risk-adjusted expected returns compared to a similar
    unconstrained portfolio.
