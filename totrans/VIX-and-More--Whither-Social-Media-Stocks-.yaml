- en: Back in October 2007, sensing a little too much froth in the stock market, I
    created something I called the [OHFdex](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/OHFdex),
    which began as a “watch list of Overripe High Fliers” and quickly evolved into
    an index designed to track 14 such stocks. When the markets turned down, the group
    was pummeled, with some [spectacular crashes](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/10/ohfdex-one-year-later.html)
    from the likes of CROCS ([CROX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/CROX)),
    Las Vegas Sands ([LVS](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/LVS)), DryShips
    ([DRYS](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/DRY)) and others.

    but I have not found sufficient reason to do so, until recently. The rise of social
    media stocks and some of the attendant valuations are the reason for my reconsidering
    the OHFdex. Clearly there will be winners as well as losers in this space, but
    relatively high valuations for LinkedIn ([LNKD](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/LNKD)),
    Groupon ([GRPN](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/GRPN)), Zynga ([ZNGA](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/ZNGA)),
    Pandora ([P](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/P)), Yelp ([YELP](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/YELP)),
    Angie’s List ([ANGI](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/ANGI)), Jive
    Software ([JIVE](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/JIVE)) and others
    have raised my eyebrows and even the launch of a Social Media ETF ([SOCL](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SOCL),
    [holdings](http://globalxfunds.com/fundholdings.php?fundid=20164&catid=27)) is
    enough to give me pause. The problem is that I have trouble picking the big winner
    from this group, particularly when adjusted for current market capitalization.
    The temptation is to short them all, but for now at least, it is time to put these
    stocks and counterparts such as [RENN](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/RENN),
    [YOKU](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/YOKU), [SOHU](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SOHU),
    [REDF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/REDF), [DMD](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/DMD),
    [FFN](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/FFN), etc. into a social media
    OHFdex and see how things play out.

    mine needs at least one canary.

    I have been living on the bleeding edge of technology hardware and software for
    decades and am about as far from being a Luddite as one can be. I was surfing
    the Internet in the 80s, dragged my laptop on planes for at least two years before
    I saw anyone else do the same, had a US Robotics before it was branded “Palm Pilot,”
    bought my first digital camera in 1996, was on Facebook when it existed only inside
    two universities, and sometimes think that too much of my life has been spent
    as an inadvertent beta tester.

    be the next big wave in technology, I wouldn’t recommend buying too many v0.9
    stocks, particularly those that are based on nascent technologies.

    shares available to short, consider buying puts, selling calls or creating a [synthetic](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/synthetic)
    short position by doing both at the same time.
