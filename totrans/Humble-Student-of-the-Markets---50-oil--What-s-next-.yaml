    of "this time is different", consensus forming about the long-term outlook for
    oil prices.

    critical commodity would, more or less, keep rising over time. So a barrel not
    produced today, even if it cost a lot to find or acquire, is effectively money
    in the bank. This is why the majors obsess over their reserves replacement ratio,
    measuring how many new barrels come in to replace the ones they pump out.

    a speech in October by BP's chief economist. He posited that the shale boom undercut
    the notion of peak oil supply, while efforts to curb carbon emissions raised the
    possibility of peak demand.

    5% of Saudi Aramco representing a Saudi strategic shift to produce at any price,
    rather than to bank the oil in the ground because it is becoming a commodity with
    diminishing value.

- en: Saudi Arabia's sudden desire to sell shares in its national champion and generally
    shift the entire economy away from its oil addiction suggests it at least entertains
    those possibilities. It also provides a rationale to maximize production at any
    price, rather than risk barrels being left worthless in the ground.

    thinking on the management of this resource and sell it as fast as possible because
    some of those assets will become stranded in the future. Call it the Hot Potato
    Theory of oil.
