 Strategists coined the term TINA (There Is No Alternative) for describing equities as an asset class during the low-interest rate era. Now that rates have risen, there is a new acronym, TARA (There Are Reasonable Alternatives). Today, U.S. faces a TARA challenge from elevated Treasury yields.

The forward P/E ratio of the S&P 500 had been tracking the inverse of the 30-year Treasury yield in the last 10 years until early 2023 when they diverged. The forward P/E and Treasury yields rose together, which made bonds more attractive. That’s the TARA valuation threat to U.S. equities.

On top of that, there’s another emerging TARA valuation threat – and it’s coming from Japan.
