- en: has convinced me previously that flash orders can indeed be used to  front-run
    other traders, but until more evidence comes in, I am yet to be convinced that
    they are the main culprit. Couldn't old-fashioned automated momentum programs
    accomplished the same thing after an initial erroneous transaction price and/or
    quote was reported? Perhaps you know of discussions elsewhere on the blogosphere
    that bring more light to the issue?
