- en: I have seen some buzz and excitement among technical analysts and in the blogosphere
    about a rebound in the commodity sectors of the stock market. While these sectors
    were highly oversold and a bounce was not unexpected, my analysis suggest that
    the sustainability of a rebound is unlikely. The more likely scenario is a sideways
    consolidation to digest the gains from the tactical rally.

    to their large cap brethren to measure the "animal spirits" of the market to give
    me clues as to the sustainability of this rebound. Here are the junior golds (GDXJ)
    relative to the senior olgds (GDX). Unless the juniors can show more strength
    to break the relative downtrend, it suggests to me that this rally is likely to
    be brief and fleeting.

    RSI and in the past three occasions, the HUI/SPX ratio has rallied strongly in
    favor of HUI. Moreover, the ratio is sitting at a major relative support level
    and, given the highly oversold conditions and the bullish RSI divergences, conditions
    are highly suggestive of a strong rally for the golds.

    the sustainability of any bullish thrust. I would point out that the highlighted
    bullish RSI divergences occurred in a secular bull market for gold and other commodities.
    It is questionable whether gold remains in a secular bull today. Consider the
    occasions on the left had side of the chart, where oversold RSI conditions occurred
    in the HUI/SPX ratio in a bear market. On those occasions, the rebound was only
    a blip and the downtrend continued soon afterwards.
