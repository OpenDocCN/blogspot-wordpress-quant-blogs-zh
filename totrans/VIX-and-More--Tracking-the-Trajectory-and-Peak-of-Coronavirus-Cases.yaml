    protocols for testing, availability of testing kits, timing of nearby positive

    least ten days from the initial 100-case day have seen what appears to be a peak

    that peak new cases might have been 14 days if China had not expanded the methodology

    is probably responsible for the fact that South Korea saw a peak in new cases
    just 9 days after the first 100-case day.

    current peak in new cases was only 8 days after the first 100-case day, perhaps
    aided by the steep trajectory in new cases during the first five days.

    the first 100-case day, though it is reasonable to expect that the newly implemented
    national lockdown and public gathering measures will help to slow the rate of
    new cases going forward.

    only 3-4 days into their post-100 timeline, so it is too early to talk about a
    peak.

    seems to cluster around 8-14 days or perhaps 8-22 days if you overlook the changes
    in the methodology for counting new cases in China.

    to expect that the 8-14 day window for new cases will also apply to the U.S. putting
    a likely peak count in the March 17
