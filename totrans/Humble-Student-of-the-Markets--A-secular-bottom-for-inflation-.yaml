    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    signal. A bullish Trend Model signal that gets less bullish is a trading "sell"
    signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading
    "buy" signal. The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of
    the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. Past trading of
    the trading model has shown turnover rates of about 200% per month.

    relationship between stocks and commodities is difficult to reconcile when seen
    through macro and fundamental lenses. Rising commodity prices require a sustained
    recovery in inflation, or a collapse in the value of financial assets. How is
    that possible in this era of inflation undershoot and pedal-to-the-metal central
    bank QE?
