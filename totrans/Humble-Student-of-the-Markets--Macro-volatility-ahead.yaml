    FOMC meeting and various Fed luminaries voiced concerns about rising inflation,
    it seems that QE3 is dead and there is a risk to the Fed's zero interest rate
    policy (ZIRP).

    ahead of Japan and the U.K., the Washington-based agency said in a report released
    today. It estimates that President Barack Obama will need to cut the deficit by
    5 percentage points of GDP in the next two fiscal years, the largest adjustment
    in “at least half a century,” to meet his pledge of halving it by the end of his
    four-year term.
