    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    signal. A bullish Trend Model signal that gets less bullish is a trading "sell"
    signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading
    "buy" signal. The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of
    the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. Past trading of
    the trading model has shown turnover rates of about 200% per month.

    month presidency, despite the Republican majority in both the Senate and House.
    One disappointment was the failure of the Republicans to repeal Obamacare because
    of disagreements between different wings of the GOP. Trump has learned that "healthcare
    is hard". Similarly, "tax reform is hard".

    While Trump's legislative initiatives may be held up by Congressional dissension,
    the President has far fewer constraints in the conduct of trade policy, foreign
    policy, and military affairs. In particular, he can do more or less what he wants
    without Congressional oversight when it comes to his role as Commander-in-Chief
    of the American military.

    about North Korea, I am going to depart from the usual economic and market analysis
    this week and focus on the question of the constraints on President Trump in a
    conflict with North Korea. To be sure, the markets are showing a high degree of
    fear that war could break out on the Korean peninsula. Past scares has seen little
    reaction from the Korean Won (KRW) or Korean equities. This time, South Korean
    stocks are tanking, both on an absolute basis and relative to global stocks.
