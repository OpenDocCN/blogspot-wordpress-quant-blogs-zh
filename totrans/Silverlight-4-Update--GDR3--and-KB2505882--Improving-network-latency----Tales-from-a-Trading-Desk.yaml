    the latest Silverlight 4 runtime update. Of most interest to a number of us in
    financial services is the “Improving network latency”. A 90 percent improvement
    is going to benefit all applications 🙂

    in Microsoft Silverlight 4 version 4.0.60129.0, improves Silverlight network latency
    by up to 90 percent, and is designed for applications that are built for the 4.0.60129.0
    runtime version.

    unfortunately that will have to wait for another day. On a positive note, its
    good to see Microsoft continuing to improve the latency of Silverlight applications,
    we can only hope Silverlight 5 will continue this trend, and Microsoft will continue
    to enhance its performance testing with each release of the Silverlight runtime,
