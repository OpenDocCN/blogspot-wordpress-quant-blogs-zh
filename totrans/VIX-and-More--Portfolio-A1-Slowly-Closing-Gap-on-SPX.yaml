- en: For the second week in a row, Portfolio A1 has taken a small bite out of the
    gaping performance hole between the portfolio and the benchmark S&P 500.  What
    was a 17.5% gap two weeks ago is now down to a slightly more manageable 11%.

    and [CNH Global (CNH)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=cnh&hl=en), continue
    to lead the resurgence, up 16.8% and 9.5% respectively in the two weeks they have
    been in the portfolio.

- en: Speaking of bright lights, I was more than a little surprised to see the portfolio
    drop [PepsiAmerican (PAS)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=pas&hl=en) this
    week.  The Minneapolis-based bottler was added to the portfolio three weeks ago
    on the strength of very solid fundamental numbers across the board and has been
    very strong technically, making a new 52 week high on Friday (and again this morning)…but
    apparently an 8.8% gain in three weeks is not good enough to keep it from yielding
    its slot in the portfolio to shipping juggernaut [DryShips (DRYS)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=drys&hl=en),
    a company that is up almost 500% in the past year and yet still manages to sport
    a P/E under 13.

    of continued global economic growth and a move away from a more conservative food
    and beverage play.  Even though the mechanical system behind Portfolio A1 doesn’t
    use this type of market logic in its decision-making, this does not stop me from
    putting my interpretive spin on what comes out of the black box.
