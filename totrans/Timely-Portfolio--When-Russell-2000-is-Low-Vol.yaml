    Boy](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2012/08/russell-2000-softail-fat-boy.html)),
    I thought I would try to approach the topic with a low volatility paradox mindset. 
    Since 2005, beta of the Russell 2000 compared to the S&P 500 has exceeded 1.2
    with a max of 1.6 for almost every rolling 1 year period.  This suggests that
    the Russell 2000 is anything but low vol.

    standard deviation of the Russell 2000 with the S&P 500.  Russell 2000 on an absolute
    and relative basis does very well when rolling 50-day standard deviation of the
    Russell 2000 minus the same standard deviation on the S&P 500 exceeds –1.25%,
    so the Russell 2000 performs best when volatility approaches the S&P 500.  In
    low relative volatility environments, it seems we should own the high beta Russell
    2000.  You will see the largest down moves all occur in the non-shaded time periods.

    work and extra links.  Far more went into this than appears above.
