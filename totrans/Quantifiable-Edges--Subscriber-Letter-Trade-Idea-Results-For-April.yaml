- en: April was a very quiet month as far as tracked trade ideas for the Quantifiable
    Edges Subscriber Letter. In fact it was the quietest. There were only 5 trade
    ideas that were filled. Four of them were index trades and the other one was a
    system trade plucked from our nightly “systems triggers” sheet. There was one
    Catapult that triggered but did not receive a fill due to a gap up the next morning
    that never closed. A big part of why April was so quiet, in fact, was that the
    market had several unfilled gaps in the direction of our trade ideas. So while
    only 5 trade ideas filled and were tracked in the Letter, at least 8 others went
    unfilled. While this occasionally happens, it’s unusual to see it to the extent
    that occurred in April. More active or aggressive traders could also have plucked
    ideas from the systems triggers sheet, which typically has at least a few triggers
    listed each night. Since there were only 5 filled trade ideas, I’ve listed them
    all below along with the summary stats. (I typically only post the summary stats
    in the blog and reserve the full list for the Letter.) First, of course, the usual
    caveats and explanations.

    as a financial advisor. I don’t feel it is appropriate to suggest allocation sizes
    without understanding someone’s financial situation and risk tolerance. Even for
    my own trading I run different portfolios with different levels of aggressiveness.
    For instance, my most aggressive portfolio is my IRA. Here I may use options to
    sometimes get 400-500% leveraged. Other portfolios on the other hand normally
    take much more conservative stances and some rarely reach or exceed 100% exposure.'

    report, but rather a trade idea scorecard. Therefore, no matter how objective
    I try to be the reporting of the results is always going to be skewed depending
    on how you approach the trades. For instance, I always recommend scaling into
    the Catapult positions in 3 parts, whereas the “System” trades (whatever system
    I unveil other than Catapult) are normally one entry. The “Index” trades I normally
    recommend scaling into as well. For my own trading I trade much larger size with
    the index trades than any of the individuals. I also control my exposure by limiting
    the total amount invested per day. As I mentioned, this will vary depending on
    the account I’m trading. My most aggressive account I may put in up to 100%/day
    and get heavily leveraged using options. A more conservative account may max out
    at 15%-20% per day.

    so personal results would vary greatly depending on the trader’s approach. Simply
    adding up the results of the individual triggers as I do below is an admittedly
    poor representation of returns. A net positive or negative does not necessarily
    mean a person following the ideas would have made or lost money during the period
    measured. And the sum total is certainly not representative of what a portfolio
    would return. All that aside, below are April’s results (click table to enlarge):*
