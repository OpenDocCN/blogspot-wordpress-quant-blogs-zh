- en: “Applying the Kappa [architecture](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/applying-the-kappa-architecture-in-the-telco-industry)
    in the telco industry” from  Strata + Hadoop World London 2016 offers a great
    read.  A large number of companies don’t really have a data volume problem, but
    they do have the “shorter time constraints, and an increasing need for accuracy”
    to derive business transformation though the use of AI.

    blogged about previous.  Streaming is the only way these days, especially with
    the evolution of Apache Spark Streaming – “batch processing is a subset of stream
    processing.”

    not Apache [Spark](http://spark.apache.org/).  Nice to see Apache [Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/)
    as the data conduit 🙂
