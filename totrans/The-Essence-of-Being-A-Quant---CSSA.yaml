    matters. In my case, one question that stood out was to define the essence and
    importance of the profession to investment management. I began to realize that
    the term itself or even the profession is poorly defined and articulated even
    within the industry. The first time I was asked what a “quant” was, I simply explained
    that they were number-crunchers that created systems for trading money. The reality
    is not far off from this simplistic explanation. But having read and heard a lot
    of different explanations (and accusations!), the essence of being a quant is
    to translate any possible unit of useable information for either financial forecasting,
    algorithm development, or rules-based systems for trading-  lets call this broad
    class simply “**trading models**“. This includes (but is definitely not limited
    to): 1) fundamental data 2) technical data 3) economic data 4) news 5) weather
    6) or anything that might be considered useful or predictive. The analytical tools
    of the trade have become highly cross-disciplinary and come from a wide variety
    of fields such as (but not limited to): 1)math 2) statistics 3) physics 4) economics
    5) linguistics 6) psychology 7)biology. A lot of the common methods used across
    fields fall in the now burgeoning interdisciplinary field of “data mining and
    analysis.”'

    trading models. If a concept is not quantifiable it is often because it is either
    1) not clearly defined or 2) simply not testable. These principles are generally
    respected by all scientists regardless of discipline. There is truthfully no area
    that should not be of interest to a quant, there are just areas that are more
    or less fruitful or simply worth prioritizing. Since financial price data of many
    time series are of high quality and readily available with long histories, this
    is a natural area of priority. Why then do quants seem to frown or pick on technical
    analysis which makes use of the same data? The answer is because most of the original
    technical analysis literature and media falls into the two categories identified
    as being difficult to quantify. Often the concepts and ideas are highly elaborate
    with a wide range of extenuating circumstances where the same conclusion would
    hold a different meaning. This implies a highly complex decision tree approach
    (assuming all of the nuances can be identified or articulated). The downside to
    believing in traditional technical analysis is twofold: 1) a lack of statistical
    robustness 2)  the flawed assumption that markets are stationary- we can rely
    on gravity *but we cannot rely on any measurable financial phenomena to always
    follow the same set of laws or rules since they operate in a dynamic ecosystem
    of different market players; asset managers, central banks, and governments constantly
    try to influence or anticipate the actions of eachother*. While that may sound
    harsh— it does not mean that we should abandon using technical indicators or ideas.
    It simply means that indicators or ideas represent testable inputs into a trading
    model that can and should be monitored or modified as conditions change.'

- en: What about the die-hard fundamental analysis approach? They are more similar
    to traditional quants (thanks to value investors for example that often create
    quantitative rules of thumb that are easy to test) and tend to use statistical
    analysis or some form of quantitative application in portfolio management regardless
    of their level of discretionary judgment.  However, they are also guilty of some
    of the same flaws as technical analysts because they often rely on concepts that
    are  either not observable  or not testable from a practical standpoint (and hence
    not quantifiable). For example, if a portfolio manager talks about the importance
    of having a meeting with management and assessing their true intentions for making
    corporate decisions– this is not really testable for a quant. Neither is the leap
    of foresight that an investor has about whether a product that has never been
    sold will be popular. The downside to believing in a purely fundamentalist approach
    is that the relative value of the insights that they claim are important is very
    difficult to assess or measure. Regardless of how important these individuals
    claim (and rationally product foresight is potentially a real skill) their qualitative
    or intuitive insights are, they must be separated from the style or factor exposure
    that is quantifiable (that is taken on either intentionally or unintentionally)
    to determine some baseline of usefulness. For example if a portfolio manager claims
    to buy large cap value stocks with high quality balance sheets, but uses additional
    “judgment factors” to narrow down their list for the portfolio, their performance
    should be benchmarked against a stock screen or factor model that approximates
    their approach. This gives some insight as to how much positive or negative value
    has been added by their added judgment. In many cases this value tends to be negative–which
    calls into question the utility in paying a portfolio manager such exorbitant
    compensation.

    as the machine is to human labor*. A quant can manufacture investment approaches
    that are far cheaper, more disciplined, have greater scale, and are more reliable.
    The more advanced and creative the quant is, the more information can be quantified,
    and the more approaches that can be replicated. A quant’s best friend is therefore
    the computer programmer who performs the very important task of creating the automated
    model. Unlike a machine, once a model is created, it can and should be frequently
    improved and monitored. How this process is done distinguishes the professional
    from the amateur quant. A professional quant will make sensible and robust improvements
    that will improve a model’s prospects for dealing with uncertainty, regardless
    of what the model performance is in the short-term– whether it is good or bad.
     The amateur quant will make cosmetic improvements to backtests of the model by
    primarily tweaking parameters in hindsight, or simply make adjustments based on
    short-term performance that would have caught the latest rally or avoided the
    latest decline. Here are a few other key differences between the pros and the
    amateurs when it comes to quant: The professional starts with a simple and clear
    idea, and then increases complexity gradually to suit the problem within an elegant
    framework. The amateur tries to incorporate everything in an awkward framework
    at the same time. The professional will seek to use logic and theory that is as
    general and durable as possible to guide model development or improvement. The
    amateur strives to create exceptional backtests and will be too data-driven with
    model development and refinement decisions. The professional takes a long time
    to slowly but earnestly improve a model fully aware that it can never be perfect.
    The amateur either wants to complete the model and proceed to trading immediately,
    or in the opposite context they are so afraid of failure that they 1)always find
    something that could go wrong 2) are overly skeptical and easily persuaded by
    peer hyperbole over fact 3)are addicted to finding new avenues to test. Finally–and
    perhaps most importantly towards impacting performance: The  professional will
    not give in easily to outside influences (management, clients etc) to make adjustments
    for ill-advised reasons unless there is a long-term or clear business case for
    doing so (the typical trades that the model takes on are perhaps difficult to
    execute in practice). The amateur will buckle to any pressure or negative feedback
    and try to please everyone.'

    of one or more of such amateur mistakes earlier in my own career. But this is
    much like the path of development for any field of expertise. In truth, almost
    any “professional” quant learns these lessons whether through peer instruction
    or the “school of hard knocks”. But one of the positive benefits of experience
    and honest self-assessment is that you can learn how to lean in the right direction.
    Without being honest with yourself, one can never get better. To end on a sympathetically
    qualitative note, it is useful to think of a professional quant as also sharing
    the qualities of a martial artist: a quant must also have solid control of their
    own mind and emotions as they relate to working with trading models to be able
    to rise to the highest level. When practiced well, this is not a frenetic and
    purposeful state, but rather what appears to be a focused but almost detached
    state where the decisions are more important than the outcomes. One really good
    idea in a relaxed moment is superior to a hundred hours of determined exploration.
    The benefit to such a state tends to be good and consistent outcomes with regards
    to model performance. Ironically, too much focus and energy invested in the outcome
    (performance) has the opposite effect. The psychology and emotional maturity of
    a quant can be as or more important as their inherent talent or knowledge towards
    driving investment performance. Of course this hypothesis is subject (and should
    be) to quantitative examination.'
