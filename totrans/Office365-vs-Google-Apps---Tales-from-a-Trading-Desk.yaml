- en: I‚Äôve been using [Google](https://www.bettercloud.com/monitor/google-apps-vs-office-365/)
    Apps for a considerable period of time. ¬†Before Google Apps, I suspect like most
    people, I used the Microsoft suite ‚Äì Outlook, Word, Power Point etc. ¬†Google Apps
    in my view moved the online collaboration bar, and stopped the madness of sending
    around documents attached to emails.

    to drop the folder concept of [Microsoft](http://www.sherweb.com/blog/office-365-or-google-apps-for-work-which-is-the-best-fit-for-your-business/)
    Outlook when moving to GMail, and embrace search, the world is a lot easier than
    folder madness.

    the Google App world. ¬†Having used Office365 for a few weeks, I‚Äôve found the following:'

    slow, and the UX just doesn‚Äôt work as well

    the Microsoft Lync client that offers chat, and instance messaging. ¬†It feels
    like a blot on to the already painful Office365 experience

    GMail iOS has just become so good in my view, that Microsoft needs to step up

    Office365, PowerPoint online require you to select either browser edit, or full
    PowerPoint desktop edit. ¬†If you go the desktop edit, you still have to client
    another edit button to actually start editing ‚Äì basically telling the server you
    are editing.

    the benefit of the doubt now that SharePoint is in the cloud. ¬†However, if you
    step into ‚ÄúShared with me‚Äù, you‚Äôll soon see the that filename isn‚Äôt render correctly
    in certain scenarios, meaning when you think you have two files with the same
    name, they are actually different üò¶

- en: Based on a few weeks of playing with Office365 from a personal perspective,
    I‚Äôm not going to move from Google Apps. ¬†Office365 may given me a closer experience
    to the historical world of Microsoft Office (desktop world), but its just too
    disconnected in the cloud, and the collaboration is just weak. ¬†Collaboration
    is key today in the socially connected work we live in. ¬†Microsoft needs to up
    its game, its testing, and the performance of its applications.
