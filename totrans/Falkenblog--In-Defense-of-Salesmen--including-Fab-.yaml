    was selling a mortgage CDO derivative while the collateral that underlay it was
    collapsing in value (the ABX-HE 2007-1 BBB index had already started imploding,
    and was trading well below par). If Goldman did lose $83 MM on this deal as they
    say (because Goldman ended up long some of this issue), this means Fab did not
    tell Goldman this deal was doomed. He either mislead his own company, or was clueless
    as to what mortgage collateral credit analysis entails. I'm guessing the latter.

    uninspiring, his group may have an essential function in society. Your average
    anything is a hack, mindlessly repeating tasks that get them through their daily
    toil. That's true for scientists, policemen, businessmen, lawyers--everyone. As

    buy things because they are 'neat', like iPods, iPads, or Photoshop. A small minority
    figure out a way to make these create really useful services, and these ideas
    create newer innovations. The consumers are the tinkerers whose trials-and-errors
    generates useful insights that can't be found via pure theory. An economy where
    consumers merely read their product manuals and followed the directions of the
    creators, would not discover as many valuable things. Salesmen encourage this
    entrepreneurial consumerism.

    totally ignorant about the benefits of their product. If you are totally unaware
    of, say, databases, you might not know that using MS Access dominates using Excel
    at some point. Without someone getting paid, the chances you get this education
    are purely a function of serendipity. However, if you know a lot about databases,
    you might find the salesman annoying, because he neglects to inform you of alternatives
    to his database, such as MySQL, that are even better. Thus, the ignorance of salesmen
    is relative, and their primary beneficiary, the

    something slightly better is much more common, and important, than top-end refinements.'

- en: My prior post noting their ignorance was elitist, as most expert users find
    salesmen redundant, but we aren't their primary audience, and their benefit to
    the economy comes from the way they have sufficient knowledge and incentives to
    make a lot of consumers, especially those noobs, a little bit better. The point
    about Fab Tourre is that if we are going to learn something about the Credit Crisis
    of 2008, his level of knowledge is probably not useful to that end, in the same
    way that a MS Access salesman is not the best person for explaining the cutting
    edge trends in database development.
