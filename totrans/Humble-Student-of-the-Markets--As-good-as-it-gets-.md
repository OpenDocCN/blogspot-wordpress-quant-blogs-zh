# Humble Student of the Markets: As good as it gets?

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2021/05/as-good-as-it-gets.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2021/05/as-good-as-it-gets.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models** 

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post, 

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The 

**Trend Asset Allocation Model**

 is an asset allocation model that applies trend following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or contraction (bearish)?"

My inner trader uses a 

**trading model**

, which is a blend of price momentum (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa). Subscribers receive real-time alerts of model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of the email alerts are updated weekly

. The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that began in March 2016 is shown below.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Buy equities*
*   Trend Model signal: Bullish*
*   Trading model: Neutral*

**What's wrong with this picture?**

The six biggest stocks in the S&P 500 reported earnings last week. Every one of them beat consensus expectations. In addition, the FOMC reiterated its dovish stance after its meeting. These developments should all be bullish. Instead, the S&P 500 only made marginal gains while exhibiting negative divergences.

From a longer term perspective, the weekly S&P 500 chart shows the index recycling after overrunning  a rising trend line indicating a possible blow-off top. The S&P 500 then printed two consecutive weekly doji candles, each of which are signs of indecision.
