    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    case for US equities with conviction. Earnings expectations are potentially low.
    There is some fiscal stimulus this year (vs. drag previous years). The Presidential
    candidates don’t appear to be multiple expanders now, but they will get more centrist
    and the riffraff will be removed in a few more weeks. Sentiment is low (two weeks
    ago an investor on a panel we moderated said “It is a multi-variable world and
    every variable is negative”.) The US probably looks relatively better than other
    parts of the world. So maybe, the bull case is just that no one can articulate
    a bull case.'
