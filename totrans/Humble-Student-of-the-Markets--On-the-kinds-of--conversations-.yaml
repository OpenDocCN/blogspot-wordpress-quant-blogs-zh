    gun control issue and incidents like the latest mass shooting aren't going to
    have a significant effect on peoples' attitude. Mrs. Humble Student of the Markets
    was particularly upset with the news of the shooting, largely because we have
    a 7th grader and we used to nearby Stamford, Connecticut.
