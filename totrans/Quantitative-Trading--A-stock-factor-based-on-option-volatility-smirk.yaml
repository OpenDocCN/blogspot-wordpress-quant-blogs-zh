    smirk is the difference between the implied volatilities of the OTM put option
    and the ATM call option. (Of course, there are numerous OTM and ATM put and call
    options. You can refer to the original paper for a precise definition.) The idea
    is that informed traders (

    for the stock) will predominately buy OTM puts when they think the future earnings
    reports will be bad, thus driving up the price of those puts and their corresponding
    implied volatilities relative to the more liquid ATM calls. If we use this volatility
    smirk as a factor to rank stocks, we can form a long portfolio consisting of stocks
    in the bottom quintile, and a short portfolio with stocks in the top quintile.
    If we update this long-short portfolio weekly with the latest volatility smirk
    numbers, it is reported that we will enjoy an annualized excess return of 9.2%.

    since transaction costs have not been accounted for. However, the beauty of factor
    models is that you can combine an arbitrary number of factors, and though each
    factor may be weak, the combined model could be highly predictive. A search of
    the keyword "factor" on my blog will reveal that I have talked about many different
    factors applicable to different asset classes in the past. For stocks in particular,

    Some factor model aficionados will no doubt propose a linear regression fit, with
    future return as the dependent variable and all these factors as independent variables.
    However, my experience with this method has been unrelentingly poor: I have witnessed
    millions of dollars lost by various banks and funds using this method. In fact,
    I think the only sensible way to combine them is to simply add them together with
    equal weights. That is, if you have 10 factors, simply form 10 long-short portfolios
    each based on one factor, and combine these portfolios with equal capital. As'
