## Kafka Connect – Data Lake Integration

“Hello World, Kafka [Connect](http://www.confluent.io/blog/hello-world-kafka-connect-kafka-streams) + Kafka Streams” offers a very interesting read on standardising the way to connect to Kafka, and thus deliver data into a streaming data platform (feeding a Data Lake and more).

“Announcing Kafka Connect: [Building](http://www.confluent.io/blog/announcing-kafka-connect-building-large-scale-low-latency-data-pipelines) large-scale low-latency data pipelines” provides more details of why you probably want to look at Connect if you are using Kafka

> Kafka Connect is a framework for large scale, real-time stream data integration using Kafka

Documentation can be found [here](http://docs.confluent.io/2.0.0/connect/index.html).  Kafka Connect JDBC Connector [here](https://github.com/confluentinc/kafka-connect-jdbc).
