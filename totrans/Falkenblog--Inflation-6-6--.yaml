    expected inflation is 1.88 percent. In other words, the public currently expects
    the inflation rate to be less than 2 percent on average over the next decade.

    and then all sorts of pain. If economists do miss this it will be like their disastrous
    experience in the 1960s, where they were blindsided by the increase in inflation

    and were sure inflation, and thus bond rates, would decline. They kept rising,
    and the next decade it only got worse.

    its eﬀects to estimate what should be expected for the recent quantitative policy
    announced by the Federal Reserve, dubbed “QE2”. We ﬁrst show that Operation Twist
