    to enforce rules and get out of the way, is simply preposterous for those who
    think the Invisible Hand is merely a theory used by conservatives to excuse their
    indifference. This reflects a failure to appreciate the complex, homeostatic mechanisms
    of self interested agents within a free market, and the infinite number of ways
    top-down rules are worked around when applied to the masses. As Hayek noted, the
    biggest flaw with the free market is that it wasn't designed, it emerged spontaneously,
    which causes people to dismiss its value. Thus, they have 1000 page plans like
    our health care bill, or ideas about new committees that will assess issues intelligently
    and disinterestedly.
