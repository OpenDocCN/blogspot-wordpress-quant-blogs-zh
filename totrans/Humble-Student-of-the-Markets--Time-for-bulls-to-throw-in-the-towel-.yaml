    in the European bourses. Yet, a glance at the relative performance of eurozone

    in a relative uptrend. No signs of any technical breakdown there.

    of Dr. Copper is a concern. Copper staged an upside breakout in early September
    and attempted a high level consolidation, but failed. Now it appears to be testing
    the former breakout level of 3.55, where technical resistance turned support.
