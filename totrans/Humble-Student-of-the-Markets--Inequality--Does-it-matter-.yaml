    tax policies provide a better framework for a national discussion of tax policy.
    For example, the Canadian tax code ties the capital gains tax rate and the dividend
    tax rate to the marginal tax rate. So when the marginal tax rate changes, so does
    the capital gains rate and the tax rate on dividends. The intent of the Canadian
    tax code on dividends on individuals is that it makes the tax rate on dividends
    roughly equal to the tax rate on interest income equal, on a pre-tax basis at
    the corporate level. That way, a corporation would be indifferent to paying dividends
    or interest expense in order to finance its business, net of credit risk which
    are priced by the market.
