- en: One statistic I look at and use in my trading is the amount of time a security
    trades above or below certain moving averages. One moving average I look at is
    the 10-day moving average. Right now there are 4 stocks in the S&P 100 that have
    closed below their 10-day moving average for at least 30 days in a row. They are
    BAC, RF, GM and WB. Using the current S&P 100, I ran some scans back over the
    last 10 years to find out how unusual this is.

- en: In the last 10 years there have been only 65 occurrences of an S&P 100 stock
    closing below its 10-day moving average for 30 days in a row. Twice there have
    been 4 or more on at once. The first time was in late August of 1998 when there
    was up to 5 and the 2nd time was early March of 2000 with 4.

    and financials, has been persistent to a degree that has rarely been seen.
