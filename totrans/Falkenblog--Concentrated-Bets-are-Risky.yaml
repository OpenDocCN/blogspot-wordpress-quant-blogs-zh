- en: about how some star investment managers are having really bad returns over the
    past year. John Wood's SRM Global Fund lost about 70 percent through March 31\.
    That's a drawdown. Pirate Capital had $2B under management, and 50% of its holdings
    in only 4 firms. Now, clearly some of these guys were simply lucky in the past,
    and taking large, undiversified bets that scored big made them appear like geniuses.
    Others, got more money than they could invest, and had to change their investment
    focus from looking at certain subtleties of the business model to industry bets,
    which are such different approaches they require a separate skill--one that even
    fewer people have.

- en: Indeed, I worked for a convertible bond desk, and was struck by the fact that
    for a large convert book, say over $1B long, you have so many positions that stock
    selection alpha is necessarily very small. The only way to outperform in a big
    way is to take industry bets, and these are, like macro forecasting, invariably
    alpha-less. You can still have edge managing a convert desk, but for any large
    book, looking at individual tilts, you can't add more than a percent to you returns
    this way. A better, scalable focus, is simply to be a patient trader, willing
    to act as a liquidity provider, so that you are usually buying at the bid and
    selling at the offer. When your I-bank calls, and wants to dump $50MM in an issue,
    you are there, but at a price discount. The edge there is more certain, and larger,
    than picking the better companies. Thus, an analyst at a desk may be great at
    picking a handful of converts, but a lousy porrtfolio manager because he does
    not understand this, while a portfolio manager clueless about relative value,
    but a disciplined trader and tough negotiator, may be a great portfolio manager
    (though invariably he markets himself as a convert selector, making for a marketing
    cluster-puck).

- en: Many of these ex-superstars, I think, are merely having bad luck. Lampert's
    ESL Investments Inc. dropped 27 percent last year and an additional 1.3 percent
    in the first three months of 2008\. Sounds bad, but Lampert has reportedly produced
    an average annual return of almost 30 percent since 1988\. If that's true, he's
    got alpha. But it appears his skill is at looking at specific turnaround deals,
    and so, his edge is necessarily part of a volatile strategy. There is simply no
    way to take a dozen or so insights, and lower the vol to the 10-12% that most
    hedge fund investors market. I don't see a problem with that. Not every hedge
    fund will have an edge in trading systems, like Renaissance or DE Shaw, and able
    to produce a minor edge via their massive technology investment, which is necessarily
    a well-diversified strategy. Most investors with alpha, in fact, are like Eddie
    Lampert. They can identify stocks based on some qualitative insight, and such
    insights can only be made over a handful of companies because to read the annual
    reports, listen the executives describe their business models, know the set of
    competitors, or even get involved with management, and this involves a lot of
    time, which is a limited resource no matter how rich you are. This does not scale,
    so one should accept the fact that big losses are going to happen.

    one puts some weight on the probability that a manager no longer has, if might
    have never had, alpha, a bad return should imply some rational investment outflows.
