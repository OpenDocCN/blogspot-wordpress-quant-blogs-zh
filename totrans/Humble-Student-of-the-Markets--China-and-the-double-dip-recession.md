Further to my last

about Stephen Roach turning more sanguine on China and her property bubble, a number of items have created further concerns about the risks of a double-dip recession.

First, the

resports that Premier Wen Jiabao warned that the world economy might face a double-dip recession, given financial-system risks and continued high unemployment in some countries.

[Time magazine](http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1971284,00.html)

has picked up the story about the Chinese property bubble. (If Time is focusing on the story, is this contrarian bullish?)

**What pricks the bubble?**

Even though prices may be stratospheric, they may not necessarily come back to earth. Overbought assets can become more overbought, as value investors found out during the Tech craze of the late 1990’s. The question then becomes one of what is the catalyst that pricks the bubble?

Here are some data points that may be of concern. Recent

indicates that rates for shipments from China to US East Coast fell 13%
