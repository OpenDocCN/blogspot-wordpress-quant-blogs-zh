    political activity: someone has to write the speeches, write initial checks, and
    those people usually are above average in economic standing. The top 51% would
    be a good coalition, but as the top 10% make so much money they are ripe for expropriating.
    Thus the most logical coalition in Friedman''s argument is from the lower middle
    class to the upper middle class, feeding off the the very rich and very poor.'

    of the middle class: a coalition of the elites with the lowest classes. We have
    legislators bestowing all sorts of sinecures, pensions, and welfare on the masses,
    creating a coalition of the unproductive, and they grow in popularity and power
    by granting more entitlements. The end game is bankruptcy.'

    future, as if this modest fiscal restraint is insane. How is this sustainable?
    In a private company, if you are losing money you cut until revenues meet expenses,
    whereas in government that's illogical via the sophistry of macroeconomics. All
    good liberals presume any spending (a component of Aggregate Demand) is a good
    idea in times of higher than average unemployment. What or how it is spent is
    not of any importance. The fact that debt is created is presumably irrelevant,
    because if the markets lends us the money, it must mean it's prudent. The thought
    of having government get out of the way to promote growth is considered stupid
    and mean.

    though they spend all day looking out for signs of the repeat of a crime that
    will not happen again anyway, a lot like the way our financial regulators analyze
    financial practices. They will look closely at arrow-heads in the pockets of 11-year
    old boys, as the did to my son recently who was taken aside and given a serious
    work-over for this transgression (he was literally crying during the interrogation).
    These do-nothings are not adding to our nation's wealth or safety, but they are
    creating permanent liabilities and voting union members.

    equestrians, and plebeians, questions about who is considered a citizen, and finally
    the apotheosis of the Emperor. There was a general trend from an aristocracy that
    built the Republic, to the end where a god-like emperor ruled with the support
    of the masses who were placated with free grain and big coliseum events. It was
    a barbell strategy, and was unstable, always extending.

    lenders would give home buyers money it was a good idea. Even after the defaults
    you hear people excuse the home buyer who put nothing down as if he's the victim
    (current muni-bond and sovereign debt salesmen take note). Similarly, the US is
    currently borrowing at record peacetime level, and the solution to our problem
    seems to have the government spend more. As anyone with some fiscal discipline
    knows, you don't buy something merely because you can, bills must be paid.

    and currently I don't see what will keep it from bringing everything down to the
    coalition of a few elites, sincerely deluded as to their belief in the virtue
    of government spending, combined with a vast entitlement mob at the bottom, all
    literally feeding off the middle class. It sounds a lot like South America.
