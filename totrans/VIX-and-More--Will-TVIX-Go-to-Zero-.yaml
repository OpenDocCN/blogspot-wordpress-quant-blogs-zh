    (VelocityShares Daily 2x VIX Short-Term ETN) made it the most heavily traded [VIX
    exchange-traded product](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20ETN)
    (ETP) on Friday, as TVIX vaulted over the former king of the mountain, [VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX).

    with surprising swiftness in the last week or two. Some of the appeal of TVIX
    is a function of its volatility: this is a product that jumped from 15 last August
    to over 109 in early October, before falling as low as 13 earlier this month.
    Based on some of the questions I have received, it is also obvious than many new
    investors in TVIX do not understand the product they are trading.'

    what VXX is, why it has underperformed for the past three years and why it has
    shortcomings both as a short-term and long-term investment.  For the most part,
    TVIX is the equivalent of VXX, with 2x leverage.   *[If you start from the bottom
    of the links below and keep reading up, the key points regarding VXX should come
    into focus fairly quickly.]*

    VIX ETPs were “designed to go to zero.” This is not the case. In fact, TVIX and
    VXX can be excellent products for those who wish to benefit from a short-term
    increase in volatility. It is important to note that these products were designed
    to be short-term trading instruments only, with the expectation that they would
    have a much greater appeal to institutional investors than to retail investors.

    many of the other VIX ETPs will be a losing proposition. For those who doubt this,
    read the [prospectus for TVIX](http://www.velocityshares.com/pdf/VelocityShares.ETN.Final.Pricing.Supplement.VIXlong.pdf).
    Start with the Risk Factors discussion on page PS-26 and make sure you read as
    far as the first paragraph of PS-28, where you will encounter the following statement:'

    as a long term investment, it is likely that you will lose all or a substantial
    portion of your investment.”*'

    than 80% since its launch at the end of November 2010 – in spite of a meteoric
    7x rise from July to October of last year. Will TVIX go to zero? No. As is the
    case with a number of other VIX ETPs, should TVIX continue to decline in price,
    a reverse split will likely be used to inflate the share price.
