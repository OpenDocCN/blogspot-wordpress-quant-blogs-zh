- en: In chapter 14, [Harris](http://www.tradingandexchanges.com) has a marvellously
    clear explanation of the interplay between market and limit orders. To simplify
    massively, imagine an order book with a very sparse flow of market orders. Traders
    placing limit orders on that book will have to improve on the prices of the existing
    limit orders to become top of book, and match with one of the rare market orders.
    But in doing so, they’ll narrow the spread between best bid and ask. As the spread
    gets narrower, market orders will trade at better prices, causing market order
    flow to increase, and spreads to widen. As spreads widen, market order prices
    worsen, making limit order based strategies more attracive. And so the system
    is in dynamic equilibrium.
