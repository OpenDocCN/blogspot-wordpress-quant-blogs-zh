    your side. Whether the market moves up or down will often have an influence on
    an individual stock or ETFs movement. As they say, a rising tide will lift all
    boats. Yet too often traders (especially short-term traders) either ignore the
    general market action or underemphasize it in their decision making. They’ll look
    for a trigger without carefully considering the likely direction of the market.

    In August I conducted a study for my gold subscribers that demonstrated and quantified
    this concept.

- en: As part of their gold subscription, traders have access to 11 different swing
    trading systems. On the system pages they are able to see the rules, Tradestation
    code, and backtest results across 2 lists of securities. One list is the S&P 100
    and the other is a list of about 100 ETFs. The ETF list looks just at equity ETFs.
    It does not include any inverse or leveraged ETFs and there are no duplicates
    in coverage (like SPY & IVV). Most of the systems were first published within
    a few months of the subscriber letter first being published over 2 ½ years ago.
    When updating all the original backtests in late August I decided to see how the
    system performed when there was a perceived market edge versus times there wasn’t.

- en: 'Many readers are aware of my Aggregator tool. The Aggregator utilizes the market
    studies I publish in the subscriber letter (and sometimes in the blog). It uses
    them to generate short-term market projections. Aggregator configurations can
    produce a long, short, or flat bias. A more detailed description of the Aggregator
    can be found here. A post describing how the Aggregator has been used as a system
    can be found here. The bottom line is that the Aggregator is my #1 tool for setting
    my short-term market bias. It also has a history dating back to the inception
    of the subscriber letter so I can easily see what my bias was going in to any
    given day.'

- en: So to quantify the value of trading with the market on my side, I ran tests
    on all 11 numbered systems to show their performance over the last 2 ½ years.
    I filtered the results to show trades that were accompanied by a confirming Aggregator
    signal versus trades with a neutral or offsetting Aggregator signal. In general
    I found results to strongly favor entering trades at times when there was also
    a perceived market edge (confirming Aggregator signal). Below is a partial example
    of the results that are shown on the website. This is “System 80509”.  It looks
    to enter long trades in strongly oversold securities.

    Still, the general results suggested you are much better off trading with the
    market winds at your back.

- en: The lesson here is not that you need to utilize Quantifiable Edges systems or
    the Aggregator tool to enhance your results. It does mean that whatever trading
    methodologies you are using, you will likely stand a much better chance of success
    if you also incorporate some solid market analysis as a filter.

- en: One last note for advanced system developers and testers. Complete historical
    Aggregator values are available with a QE subscription. You could easily download
    and apply them as a filter to test the effect on any of your own systems.
