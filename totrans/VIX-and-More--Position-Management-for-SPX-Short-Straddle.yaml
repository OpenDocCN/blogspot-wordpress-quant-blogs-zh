    most difficult issue for them to come to terms with is [position management](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/position%20management).
    With stocks, it is easy for an investor to reason that if a particular stock rises
    to a target price of X, he or she will take the profits and exit the position.
    By the same token, if the stock falls below Y, this means it is time to cut losses.

    factors is certainly the potential for extreme percentage changes in an option
    position. It is not uncommon for an option to double in value for several consecutive
    days; alternatively an option can lose half of its value several days in a row.

    trade on the SPX that I first talked about on August 20^(th) in [The Sideways
    Play](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/08/sideways-play.html).

- en: First, while I did not go into detail about the rationale for the trade at the
    time of the original post, one of the technical factors I found appealing was
    the possibility of the 1000 serving as a consolidation point, with SPX potentially
    trading in a narrow range that was defined by 978-1018 at the time. The chart
    below shows that following the initial post (black arrow), SPX subsequently rallied
    as high as 1040, closing a little over 1030 on August 27^(th). When SPX subsequently
    fell back below 1000 last week, there was reason to believe that the 1030 (closing)
    and 1040 (intraday) levels might serve as resistance. As described in [SPX Short
    Straddle Still Hugging 1000 Level](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/09/spx-short-straddle-still-hugging-1000.html),
    the trade had started to yield some meaningful profits at this stage.

    of the profit zone, the biggest risk is a breakout to the upside. I considered
    the risk to be reasonably well contained as long as SPX did not take out the August

    of 1032\. With yesterday’s close of 1033.37, therefore, I would close half of
    the straddle by buying back the at risk portion of the position, the calls. Ideally,
    this would have been done just prior to the end of trading yesterday or perhaps
    at today’s open.

    original premium was $5000 per contract. At the close of trading yesterday, the
    position could have been closed out for $3820, yielding a profit of $1180 per
    contract. This is down from a profit of $1490 a week ago today when the SPX was
    still hugging the 1000 level. The change in profitability in the past week has
    been largely the result of directional movement (

    were to make a sharp move down. Using 1030 as resistance turning into support,
    one could plan to exit the puts if the SPX were to close below 1030\. A lower
    SPX target might also make sense if I wanted to squeeze out some extra
