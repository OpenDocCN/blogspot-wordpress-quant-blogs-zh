- en: Today the first non-Barclays volatility ETN began trading ([CVOL](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/CVOL)),
    whose formal name is (and I am not making this up) “C-Tracks Exchange Traded Notes
    Based on the Performance of the Citi Volatility Index Total Return.” Fortunately,
    what I will be affectionately calling CVOL also has a formal [short name](http://www.nyse.com/pdfs/CVOL.pdf)
    of “C-Tracks ETN on CVOL” so that if anyone happens to ask you what CVOL stands
    for at a cocktail party, at least you can blurt out the answer in one breath.

    target maturity and 2x leverage component will perform relative to the Barclays
    competition: [VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX) and [VXZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXZ).'

    comparisons, but with 3900 shares traded today, at least some investors are already
    stepping up to the plate.

    locate it in the [VIX ETN](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20ETN)
