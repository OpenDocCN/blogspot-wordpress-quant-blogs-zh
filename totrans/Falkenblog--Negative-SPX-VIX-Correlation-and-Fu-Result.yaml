    and there's no correlation, and there's a slight negative correlation between
    volatility levels and stock returns. So, it seems mainly a contemporaneous pattern
    applied to changes in volatility, spilled milk as opposed to a predictor. Think
    about when volatility was rising in 2008, and prices were falling simultaneously.
    The rise in volatility was not predicting price moves, just reflecting them, and
    the high volatility correlated with both the big move down and the big rebound
    in the latter part of 2009\.

    what, exactly. I don't see this in the data, and I doubt his specific EGARCH would
    change that, but it's difficult to recreate his methodology exactly. I presume
    it is in some sort of selection bias in his sample. He states that 'stocks with
    high idiosyncratic volatilities are contemporaneous with high returns, which tend
    to reverse in the following month. As a result, the returns of high-IVOL stocks
    are abnormally low in the next month', a finding I find bizarre because it's contrary
    to the pattern above, which hold not just for indices but stocks as well.
