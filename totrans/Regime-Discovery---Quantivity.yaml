    many traders think first of macro principles: business cycle, risk appetite, interest
    rates, liquidity, market volatility, *etc*. This perspective is motivated by applying
    [herd behavior](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_behavior) to market dynamics:
    regimes arise when many people either trade in harmony (trends) or disharmony
    (range). In this sense, herd behavior is an [unobservable](https://quantivity.wordpress.com/2010/02/15/trading-the-unobservable/)
    for regimes.'

    predict the future or settle for exploiting established trends (*i.e.* macroeconomic
    forecasting or trend following). Although both strategies are actively traded,
    profits tend to be unpredictable.'

    identify regimes early in their formation, and probabilistically inform how to
    trade ahead of the herd (whether by seconds or days). For example, how price or
    volatility of HP, VGT, and DJIA change in relation to a price change in IBM. Alternatively,
    how USD crosses change in response to an unobserved Fed intervention.

    a sketch, which readers are encouraged to comment upon.

    posts applying clustering and correlation, including [minimum spanning trees for
    inter-asset correlations](http://tr8dr.wordpress.com/2009/12/28/10-years/) and
    [equity clusters](http://tr8dr.wordpress.com/2009/12/30/equity-clusters/). Older
    literature includes interesting articles by [Zoran Obradovic](http://www.ist.temple.edu/%7Ezoran/)
