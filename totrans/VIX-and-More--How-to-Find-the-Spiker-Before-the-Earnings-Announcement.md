# VIX and More: How to Find the Spiker Before the Earnings Announcement

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/05/how-to-find-earnings-spiker-before.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/05/how-to-find-earnings-spiker-before.html#0001-01-01)

![](img/8c6f3d4eacbf92d8886d201baf5a1b64.png)Several readers have expressed interest in how I came up with my [earnings spike potential algorithm](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/earnings%20spike%20potential%20algorithm).  Essentially, this is something that has evolved over the past three weeks as a result of my desire to find companies with a high probability of making a substantial near-term move and give my [CNBC Million Dollar Portfolio Challenge](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/CNBC%20Million%20Dollar%20Portfolio%20Challenge) portfolio a chance to make a run at the finals.  To make a long story short, I got the volatility I wanted, but I didn’t always get the direction right.

I would not call this a battle-tested formula.  It is more like a hypothesis that continues to evolve as I get more data and continue to test and tune some of the elements. Think of it as [just-in-time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_In_Time_%28business%29) sausage making.

I am not an arsonist (I even missed out on youthful pyromania), but I liken this task to understanding how to get a fire started and make sure it quickly builds in intensity and spreads as rapidly as possible.  For a fire, you need a starter and an accelerant; for an earnings spike, it’s essentially the same thing.

In the links below, wherever possible I have provided a favorite deep link to a free public source that includes the relevant data, calculation, graphic, etc.

Some of the *more important factors* I look at are:

*   ***Implied volatility***, a great initial screening tool (higher is better) – free data at [iVolatility.com](http://www.ivolatility.com/options.j?x=0&y=0&ticker=ZRAN%3ANASDAQ&R=1); if you have an account at [optionsXpress](https://optionsxpress.com/), they have excellent options screens available to all

*   ***Beta*** (higher is better) is another good accelerant barometer, though not as good as IV – available many places, including [Google Finance](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=zran&hl=en) 
*   ***Number of analysts*** (lower is better)and ***degree of analyst consensus*** (lower is usually better) – [Marketwatch.com](http://www.marketwatch.com/) has a page that not only summarizes the analyst estimates, but also provides a “[coefficient variance](http://www.marketwatch.com/tools/quotes/estimates.asp?symb=zran&sid=15898)” number that gives you a sense of the dispersion of opinion.  In many cases, the earnings and/or revenue surprise is the fire starter.

*   ***Short ratio: days to cover*** (higher is better) – a classic accelerant indicator, with free data available at [ShortSqueeze.com](http://www.shortsqueeze.com/index.php?symbol=zran&submit=Enter)

Some *secondary factors* to consider:

*   ***Price to earnings ratio*** (negative or n/a is best, higher is better) – available many places, including [Google Finance](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=zran&hl=en) 
*   Earnings history data **–** there is a higher probability of a surprise if there is an erratic earnings history; there is also greater potential for a high magnitude surprise if there is a consistent pattern of beating (or missing) expectations **–** assuming the pattern can be broken. One fun source that has earnings dates baked in to charts and post-earnings performance data available is [WhisperNumber.com](http://www.whispernumber.com/quotes.jsp?ticker=yhoo) (more complete data for larger companies.) [](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=zran&hl=en) 
*   ***Recent analyst ranking and/or price estimate changes*** (none is best) – these can work both ways, but most often they reduce the probability of a surprise.  Again, [Marketwatch.com](http://www.marketwatch.com/tools/quotes/snapshot.asp?symb=ZRAN&pg=analyst) is a good source.

*   ***News flow*****–** this is a highly subjective/qualitative assessment, but there are certain types of pre-earnings news that I believe can indicate in increased or decreased likelihood of an earnings surprise.  Be particularly wary of binary events, such as the pending FDA approval for a drug and the like.  The best place to find the relevant information is probably by looking at [company news at Yahoo Finance](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=zran).  I am not ready to expand upon this one at this stage, except for…

*   ***Recent company guidance*** (none is best) – as with recent changes in analyst opinion, these usually dampen the surprise potential.  Again, try [Yahoo Finance](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=zran).

*   ***Insider transactions*** – these are sometimes difficult to evaluate in the context of earnings, but if an apparent transactional pattern is confirmed or contradicted by earnings, there could be an accelerant.  I favor [Form4Oracle](http://www.form4oracle.com/company?cik=0001003022&ticker=zran) as a free public source of insider transaction data.

*   ***Technical analysis*** – this is good for identifying the heightened possibility of breakouts, violation of important support and resistance levels, and other factors that may act as technical accelerants.  The [gallery view](http://stockcharts.com/charts/gallery.html?zran) at StockCharts.com is always a good place to start.

*   ***Put to call ratio*** (higher is better) – somewhat analogous to the short data is the individual stock open interest put to call ratio, data for which is available at [SchaeffersResearch.com](http://www.schaeffersresearch.com/streetools/indicators/equity_oipcratio.aspx) 
*   ***Recent options activity*** – another subjective and difficult to assess measure, but if significant changes in open interest favor either puts or calls, this may be a tell.  Not much in the way of great public data, but you may get some valuable information from [Yahoo Finance](http://finance.yahoo.com/q/os?s=ZRAN&m=2007-05-18).

*   ***Company size*** (lower is better) – this includes revenues and market capitalization.  Available many places, including [Google Finance](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=zran&hl=en).

*   ***Recent IPO or lack of relevant operating history*** (less history is better) – In general, the shorter the track record, the bigger the chance for an earnings surprise.  This means that the first quarterly report or two with new management, new products, a new acquisition, etc. increases uncertainty about the result – and the potential for a surprise.

As a footnote, if you are looking for a good source for who reports when that is sortable by time of day (BMO, AMC, etc.), I like [TheStreet.com](http://thestreet.ccbn.com/)’s [Earnings Release calendar](http://thestreet.ccbn.com/earning.asp?client=thestreet), where you can click on the Date/Time column to sort accordingly.  If you are not familiar with a lot of the tickers/companies, then I suggest that a first pass be limited to those companies with four letter tickers whose EPS estimate and/or previous year actual EPS is negative or close to zero.

Finally, I feel obliged to remind everyone that this is a method for finding the high potential post-earnings movers, ****not**** the winners.  I continue to play with the weightings of the various factors and ultimately your weightings should reflect your research and beliefs about the market.  If you keep track of the pre-earnings data and the outcomes, you should be able to develop and tweak your own model – or at least flag some potential high fliers.
