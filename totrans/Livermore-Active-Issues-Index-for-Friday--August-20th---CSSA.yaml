- en: 1\. The price action in PCLN is beautiful, and is what I’ve been looking for
    when trading the Livermores. Does the LTR ranking take multiple timeframes into
    account or does it focus on shorter intraday timeframes as mentioned in an earlier
    post?

- en: 2\. Since you’ve been posting, the Livermores have moved predictably in relation
    to the index – outperform when the index rises and underperform when the index
    drops (although the 10% outperformance is still relatively good). With the exception
    of PCLN as noted above, I don’t necessarily notice any outstanding “trendiness”
    in the Livermores. I’ve heard some commentators note that the stock market as
    a whole has acted more like one big stock market rather than a market of stocks
    (student body right). I wonder if the difference in LTR rankings have been less
    pronounced this year than in typical years you’ve backtested. Thanks!
