    Inequality seemed to make a big difference almost no matter what other variables
    were in the model or exactly how we defined a "growth spell". Inequality is of
    course not the only thing that matters but, from our analysis, it clearly belongs

- en: '[T]he increase in inequality is primarily due to a transition of labor from
    low-productivity agriculture to a higher productivity industry, not dissimilar
    from the evolution in the United Kingdom between the mid-1800s and early 20th
    century or for that matter in the United States between the late 1800s and 1927\.
    China, like the United Kingdom and the United States, is following an intense
    inequality upswing of the Kuznets curve (named after Russian-American statistician
    and economist Simon Kuznets), characteristic for all, or most, fast industrializers.
    But after a certain points, or so Kuznets’s theory suggests, equalizing elements
    kick in: urban-rural gap declines as agriculture becomes more productive, more
    people get educated (and the skill premium declines), and greater wealth as well
    as the aging of the population lead to increased demand for social welfare and
    thus redistribution. This is basically the path that the US and the UK both took
    after they passed the (previous) peak of their inequality some 100 years ago.
    On that reading of Chinese inequality, one can be optimistic: there are strong
    forces that may curb it in the future. We already see some first signs of it:
    from rising wages to the demand to extend the social safety net beyond urban state-sector
    workers.'

    中国，像英国和美国一样，正在经历库兹涅茨曲线（以俄罗斯-美国统计学家和经济学家西蒙·库兹涅茨的名字命名）所描述的收入不平等上升的强烈阶段，这是所有或大多数快速工业化的国家共有的特征。但是，库兹涅茨的理论暗示，在达到一定点之后，均衡因素开始起作用：随着农业变得更加高效，城乡差距缩小，更多的人接受教育（并且技能溢价下降），更多的财富以及人口老龄化导致对社会保障的需求增加，从而促进了再分配。基本上，在美国和英国通过（之前的）不平等高峰大约100年后，都采取了这条道路。从这一点来看，对中国收入不平等的解读可以是乐观的：未来可能会有强大的力量来抑制它。我们已经开始看到一些初步的迹象：从不断上升的工资到要求将社会安全网扩展到城市国有部门工人之外。'

    that governments are such huge players in the industry. Not only are they the
    biggest spenders on infrastructure; even private projects require government approvals,
    permits, worksite inspections, and the like. The more rules you have, and the
    more people enforcing them, the more opportunities there are for corruption. And,
    in many countries, the process of awarding contracts and permits is opaque.***
    As Erik Lioy, a forensic accountant and fraud expert at Grant Thornton, told me,
    “When it’s not clear how projects get approved, people assume the worst, and that
    provides incentives to do a bribe or kickback.”

- en: The economic boom in the past decades has also been associated with a widening
    wealth gap. According to a report from China’s Southwestern University of Finance
    and Economics, the Gini coefficient – measured on a scale of 0 to 1 with higher
    figures associated with greater inequality – was 0.61 in 2010\. While it’s not
    atypical for a fast developing economy to experience increasing inequality, China’s
    level of inequality is comparable to that of the Philippines and Russia and much
    worse than that of Japan, the United States and many countries in newly liberalized
    Eastern Europe. Based on the study of Wang Xiaolu, an economist at the independent
    National Economic Research Institute in Beijing, ***analysts have estimated that
    the wealthiest 10 percent of Chinese earned 65 times that of poorest 10 percent.
    High inequality has increased the danger for China to tumble into the “middle-income
    trap” – getting stuck at a level of development that falls short of that of more
    advanced economies. Worse, the government’s failure to address this social crisis
    may pit the underprivileged against an entitled minority.***

    economy will effortlessly be able to sustain relatively rapid top-line growth
    despite accumulating evidence to the contrary. Nominal GDP growth has slowed sharply
