    a private default. If you had a debt in US Dollars in Argentina prior to the default
    you were forced to pay it back in Peso. Indeed it was illegal to make payment
    in US dollars.

    Citigroup in Buenos Aires became a peso deposit. If you really wanted to keep
    your dollars you needed to make your Citigroup deposit in New York.

    banks all had lots of US dollar funding. If you devalued without forcing their
    default then they would all have uncontrolled defaults (a true disaster) and the
    country would lose its institutions. Telefonica Argentina would have failed too
    - failing to replay USD debts.

    Drachma (to perhaps a third the value of the Euro) then the banks (which are loaded
    with Greek Sovereign paper) would default. Even Hellenic Telecom would default
    because they would be forced to repay their billions of Euro borrowings whilst
    collecting only Drachma phone bills.

    can''t pay back these foreign bankers without great sacrifices." At first, they
    would point out that Ireland is doing what needs to be done: cutting spending

    ***But when pressed, they would come around to admitting that, "Yes, Ireland will
    get a haircut." Everyone I met expected it to happen***. The difference was the
    path to the haircut. But while the politics matter, the destination is the same.'

    when Greece and Portugal get theirs. They fully expect it. ***In a meeting with
    an establishment-insider economist (off the record), who was at the table when
    the first deal was done, he said there was an implicit understanding with the
    IMF (and ECB) that whatever was offered to Greece, et al. would be available to
    Ireland.*** So Ireland went along with the bailout to keep from imploding the
    euro and averting a crisis that would have been biblical in proportions. The future
    of the euro is now not in their hands, because by taking on the debt they did
    not blow the euro up. Which could have happened, because European politicians
    were not ready for such a crisis.

    to be opened for them by the IMF and the ECB. A far more respectable path for
    those who are very pro-Eurozone. But Irish leaders clearly get that voters expect
    that something will be done. They have time, as it will be another three-plus
    years before elections. By then, the crisis will have fully evolved and resolved
    itself, as far as the political public is concerned. And politicians will take
    the credit, as they always and everywhere do.
