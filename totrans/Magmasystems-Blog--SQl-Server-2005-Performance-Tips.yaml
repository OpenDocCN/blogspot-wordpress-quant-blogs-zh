    tips will work for Sybase as well.

- en: It is remarkable what performance improvements you can make in an OLTP system
    if you hire a true database tuning expert to go over your systems with a fine-tooted
    comb. Unfortunately, the tuning does not usually extend into refactoring the data
    model. This is because a lot of apps touch the databases, and you would then have
    to go in and start refactoring app code.

    you to take advantage of them as you are developing new apps. If you are a dev
    manager, try to get funding for two weeks of a SQL Server 2005 expert's time once
    your data model is written.

    between frequenty-used database indexes and the spindles.

    database access, spend the bucks and hire a DB architect who knows how to tune
    databases like a 1964 Fender Strat.
