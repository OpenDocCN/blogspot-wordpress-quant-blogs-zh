- en: Fab Tourre is the Goldman saleman singled out by the SEC. It's important to
    remember a salesman's job is to get people to buy things they wouldn't otherwise
    buy. If a product sells itself it doesn't need salesmen. Salesmen get paid to
    get people to buy things they otherwise didn't want, and probably don't need or
    can't afford. If this is a crime, it's being committed right now by millions.

    are selling. Very few salesmen can answer technical questions about their inventory.
    A really knowledgeable salesmen isn't a good salesmen, because anyone who knows
    a lot about their product and the competition knows that their product, at best,
    is not that much better than alternatives. Most things have cheaper substitutes
    that are just as good, that's what savvy people know--that's the essence of being
    savvy. Most salesmen are perforce selling inferior products, but to sell a product
    you can't know that otherwise you are not as convincing when giving the pitch
    as to why their product is a must buy. Cognitive dissonance is much easier to
    tolerate when you are too ignorant to sense it.

    For example,

    'because', and of course 'please' and 'thank you', are great words when making
    a sale. He also notes that while first names are great, use them sparingly or
    it sounds manipulative. So, start a discussion by saying the person's name, and
    end with their name ( 'OK John, ...make point... thanks, John, talk to you soon'),
    but don't use their name in the middle! All good stuff, and you can see that to
    master these tactics you need some skills, though knowing a lot about the product
    is not one of them.

    evil, not from his own soul, but from long observation of the nature of evil in
    others. Similarly, bond investors and salemen should have experienced the crises
    that are the true tests of bond safety. As a 28 year old (circa 2007), Fab never
    experienced a true credit cycle, and bonds only demonstrate their value during
    those infrequent crises that occur every 5 to 10 years. Tourre started at Goldman
    in 2001, missing the tech bubble, and never had any experience with the Commercial
    Real Estate bubble of 1990, the oil-patch bubble in the 1980's, the interest rate
    crisis of 1994, etc. Buying a bond from someone who has only read about theses
    things is a problem because financial market history seems a lot more predictable
    than it is in real time.

    didn't fully understand the CDOs he was selling, and was exaggerating its safety.
    That's not a crime, that's the definition of a salesman.

    manager ACA that Paulson & Co. was an equity investor, a material misrepresentation.
    Goldman flatly denies this, the SEC says they did. I think the real lawsuit should
    be against ACA for gross negligence, though I'm not sure what's left of ACA could
    make any restitution.
