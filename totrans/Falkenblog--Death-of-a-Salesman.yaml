- en: Fab Tourre is the Goldman saleman singled out by the SEC. It's important to
    remember a salesman's job is to get people to buy things they wouldn't otherwise
    buy. If a product sells itself it doesn't need salesmen. Salesmen get paid to
    get people to buy things they otherwise didn't want, and probably don't need or
    can't afford. If this is a crime, it's being committed right now by millions.

  zh: Fab Tourre 是被 SEC 点名的高盛销售员。重要的是要记住销售员的工作是让人们购买他们本来不会购买的东西。如果一个产品能自己销售，那就不需要销售员。销售员的工作是让人们购买他们本来不想要、可能也不需要或者负担不起的东西。如果这是一种犯罪行为，那么现在就有数百万人正在犯罪。
- en: Further, salesmen tend to have a very superficial understanding of what they
    are selling. Very few salesmen can answer technical questions about their inventory.
    A really knowledgeable salesmen isn't a good salesmen, because anyone who knows
    a lot about their product and the competition knows that their product, at best,
    is not that much better than alternatives. Most things have cheaper substitutes
    that are just as good, that's what savvy people know--that's the essence of being
    savvy. Most salesmen are perforce selling inferior products, but to sell a product
    you can't know that otherwise you are not as convincing when giving the pitch
    as to why their product is a must buy. Cognitive dissonance is much easier to
    tolerate when you are too ignorant to sense it.

  zh: 此外，销售员往往对他们所销售的产品了解得很肤浅。很少有销售员能回答关于他们库存的技术问题。一个真正了解的销售员并不是一个好的销售员，因为任何了解自己的产品和竞争对手情况的人都知道，他们的产品充其量也就不比其他替代产品好多少。大多数东西都有更便宜的替代品，而且质量一样好，这就是精明人知道的事情——这就是精明的本质。大多数销售员必须销售劣质产品，但是要销售一种产品，你不能知道这一点，否则在进行销售陈述时就不够有说服力，无法解释为什么他们的产品必须购买。当你太无知以至于无法察觉到认知失调时，这种认知失调就更容易忍受。

    'because', and of course 'please' and 'thank you', are great words when making
    a sale. He also notes that while first names are great, use them sparingly or
    it sounds manipulative. So, start a discussion by saying the person's name, and
    end with their name ( 'OK John, ...make point... thanks, John, talk to you soon'),
    but don't use their name in the middle! All good stuff, and you can see that to
    master these tactics you need some skills, though knowing a lot about the product
    is not one of them.

  zh: 是一位通讯专家，他强调了诸如“想象”、“现在”、“因为”，当然还有“请”和“谢谢”等词，在销售时是很棒的词语。他还指出，虽然名字是很好的，但要谨慎使用，否则会听起来很有操纵性。因此，通过说出对方的名字开始讨论，并以他们的名字结束（“好的约翰，……要点……谢谢，约翰，很快再见”），但不要在中间使用他们的名字！所有这些都是很好的东西，你可以看到要掌握这些技巧需要一些技能，虽然对产品了解很多并不是其中之一。
- en: Aristotle said that a judge should not be young, he should have learned to know
    evil, not from his own soul, but from long observation of the nature of evil in
    others. Similarly, bond investors and salemen should have experienced the crises
    that are the true tests of bond safety. As a 28 year old (circa 2007), Fab never
    experienced a true credit cycle, and bonds only demonstrate their value during
    those infrequent crises that occur every 5 to 10 years. Tourre started at Goldman
    in 2001, missing the tech bubble, and never had any experience with the Commercial
    Real Estate bubble of 1990, the oil-patch bubble in the 1980's, the interest rate
    crisis of 1994, etc. Buying a bond from someone who has only read about theses
    things is a problem because financial market history seems a lot more predictable
    than it is in real time.

  zh: 亚里士多德说，一个法官不应该年轻，他应该从长时间观察他人的邪恶本质中学会认识邪恶，而不是从自己的灵魂中学会认识邪恶。同样，债券投资者和销售员应该经历过真正考验债券安全性的危机。作为一个
    28 岁的人（大约在 2007 年左右），法布从来没有经历过真正的信用周期，而债券只有在那些每 5 到 10 年发生一次的罕见危机中才能展示其价值。图尔在
    2001 年进入高盛，错过了科技泡沫，从未经历过 1990 年的商业地产泡沫，1980 年代的石油泡沫，1994 年的利率危机等。从一个只是读过这些东西的人那里购买债券是个问题，因为金融市场的历史看起来比实时情况更容易预测。
- en: So, when Fab speaks to congress this week, remember, he's a salesman. He probably
    didn't fully understand the CDOs he was selling, and was exaggerating its safety.
    That's not a crime, that's the definition of a salesman.

  zh: 所以，当法布本周在国会发言时，请记住，他是个推销员。他可能并没有完全理解他在推销的CDOs，而且可能夸大了它的安全性。这不是一种犯罪，这就是推销员的定义。
- en: The key fact in this question appears to be whether Tourre or Goldman told asset
    manager ACA that Paulson & Co. was an equity investor, a material misrepresentation.
    Goldman flatly denies this, the SEC says they did. I think the real lawsuit should
    be against ACA for gross negligence, though I'm not sure what's left of ACA could
    make any restitution.

  zh: 这个问题的关键事实似乎是 Tourre 或高盛是否告诉资产管理公司 ACA，保尔森公司是一个股权投资者，这是一个实质性的错误陈述。高盛坚决否认了这一点，但证券交易委员会说他们是这么做的。我认为真正的诉讼应该针对
    ACA 的重大过失，尽管我不确定 ACA 的残留部分是否能作出任何赔偿。
