- en: As I’ve given various speeches over the last year, it has become clear to me
    that very few Americans are aware of the extraordinary recovery Canada has achieved
    since the mid-1990s. When I bring it up, most people seem surprised that Canada
    could have gone from a laughing stock to the envy of the developed world in just
    a decade. But, actually, 10 years wasn’t the true recovery period. And that was
    my big surprise from reading *[The Canadian Century](http://www.amazon.com/Canadian-Century-Moving-Americas-Shadow/dp/1554702976?ie=UTF8&tag=humblest-20&link_code=btl&camp=213689&creative=392969)![](img/5f4556b293c588bc8fcfb0aebcbf0558.png)*.
    The reality is that Canada achieved stunning progress in a mere *three years*.
    Further, this time frame was consistent at both the federal and provincial levels.

    Jean Chretien and finance minister Paul Martin Jr. (who later became prime minister),
    moved from deficit to surplus in the 1990s, it was aided by substantial tailwinds.
    Don't forget that the US federal budget was in surplus at about the same time
    during the Clinton years. Much of the US surplus was helped by capital gains during
    the Tech Bubble of the late 1990s, which is not likely to be repeated.

    take some pain, whether it's in the form of higher taxes and/or reduced government
    spending, and all will be well. I believe he understates the problem.

    maintained its fiscal discipline on a relative basis, the Bush II Administration
    embarked on two spending initiatives that made the federal budget dive into deep
    deficit waters. The first was the tax cuts. With another election coming up and
    contentious debate on both sides of the issue, it would be inappropriate for a
    Canadian resident to wade in on that debate and I'll leave it up to the American
    people to decide on whether a continuation of the Bush II tax cuts is a good idea.

    Being in government is about making choices. In a democracy, it is up to the people
    to make choices through their elected representatives. From a strictly fiscal
    viewpoint, the wild ramp-up in military spending makes no sense. American troops
    are in Afghanistan, Iraq and the Gulf as a direct result of the 9/11 attacks.

    strategy of consistently outspending your enemy by 10 million to 1 will make you

    of how to spend money. If a continued military commitment is the choice the citizens
    of a country chooses to make, then let the People express its will.
