    it used to, given the expansion of the blogosphere), I thought it worth noting
    that in addition to closing over the critical 1000 level for the first time since
    November, the SPX also closed 15% above its simple moving average for the first
    time since 1999.

    to 1970 (blue) and an overlay of the ratio of the SPX to its [200 day simple moving
    average](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/200%20day%20SMA) (red.) With
    today’s close (red diamond), the SPX is now entering a level where [mean reversion](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/mean%20reversion)
    trading often makes the SPX vulnerable to a reversal. That being said, the 200
    day moving average will be rising at a rate of about 0.40 per trading day for
    the next month or so, meaning that sideways action or even small gains will help
    to work off some of the excess in this ratio and bring it back toward a more typical
    range.

    begin between now and Friday’s employment report, that the SPX may make a quick
    move to 1100\. Of course it is going to be awfully difficult to bet against the
    bulls until there is some evidence of an Achilles heel.

    SPX has not closed 20% above its 200 day SMA since 1983.
