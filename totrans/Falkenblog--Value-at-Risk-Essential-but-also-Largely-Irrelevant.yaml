    taking unauthorized bets. If a rogue trader decides to punt on the dollar-yen
    exchange rate, that will show up, so it is helpful in keeping your traders in
    line. But it very rarely

    website, essential, but also not a first-order issue for managing a bank's relevant
    risk. It is a mistake of the first order to think banks are picking a VaR in mean-volatility
    space to find their optimal place on the efficient frontier. VaR risk is mainly
    incidental, and useful for minimizing operational risk (eg, many fatal risks would
    never have been tolerated if they were on the radar ex-ante).

    He has credentials that demonstrate he knows a lot of math (Doctorate in Nuclear
    Engineering and PhD in Condensed Matter Physics/Science of Materials). He speaks
    often at Risk Conferences, and is on the Board of Trustees for GARP. But what
    clearly comes across is that he does not speak much to decision makers in RBS
    about actual strategy.

    focused on measuring risk. At the same time, it is forgetting that managing risk
    is about making decisions under uncertainty. It also seems to hold on to two dangerous
    beliefs: first, that our risk metrics can be estimated to five decimal places;
    second, that once we have done so the results will self-evidently guide our risk
    management choices.'

    no idea how this information is related to strategic and tactical decisions. VaR
    is pretty irrelevant for banks. Sure, it's an essential way to aggregate market
    maker risk, but that risk has been pretty insignificant in the current crisis,
    because to the extent assets or businesses subject to VaR had significant losses,
    the VaR was calculated predicated on the assumptions that drove the business decision
    (ie, that collateral value of equity asset backed securities would not decline).
    This assumption, which is not very technical, made the resulting VaR innocuous,
    and is something anyone understands. Why did people assume this? That's an interesting
    question, but I think it has very little to do with Value-at-Risk. That is, an
    arbitrary but large stress test would have embodied the same assumption circa
    2006.

    pounds of daily 95% VaR, which annualizes to about a 1.3B pounds at a 99.9% VaR.
    Say we multiply that by 3, to get capital needed, we are up to 4 B pounds. RBS
    has about 73B in equity capital. Clearly even in his own company, VaR is not the
    primary driver for understanding their 'risk'.

- en: The idea that Value-at-Risk, or risk numbers at the 5th decimal place, are dangerous,
    presupposes people are using this information in a significant way. That is, supposedly,
    when the VaR of the currency market moves from 43.32491 to 43.32492, traders adjust
    their spreads. Let us give Ricardo the benefit of the doubt, that the "5th decimal"
    statement was rhetorical flourish. In any case he thinks VaR drives real decisions.
    In his circle of contacts (GARP, risk management conferences, presentation of
    VaR to regulators), this arguement may be tenable, but highlights he does not
    understand how strategic decisions are made within a bank. He is being patronized
    by senior management, who absolutely love risk managers who think the fifth decimal
    of their VaR is important, because they don't see the bigger picture and are then
    free to do whatever they want.

    very high Sharpe ratios (>3) because you make you money off bid-ask spread and
    front-running customers, so profit is primarly a function of volume. Any residual
    holdings generate 'market risk' via your VaR, but most market makers don't care
    too much because on a VaR basis, they are all hitting massive home runs in that
    Sharpes are always greater than anyone's hurdle rate. Market making profits are
    a function of volume, which means sales, contacts, not having better VaR measures.
    If they could choose to double their market making activity, and thereby double
    their VaR, all would choose to do so. VaR is a good way to make sure traders aren't
    changing their business model, but it does not capture anything essential to that
    business model, because all market makers want more volume; VaR is not like a
    choice variable in risk-return space.

    noting that 'behavioral finance' shows all sorts of biases. This means, anecdotes.
    All you need is the representative anecdote, the correct prior! That's the problem
    with common sense. What some people think is common sense, other people think
    is nonsense. Not that this is not true, merely unhelpful. It should go without
    saying that the real world does not have numbers drawn from urns where we know
    the proportion of blue and red balls contained therein. How this plays out, given
    the parochial nature of most business decisions, is really no more helpful than
    saying 'you should estimate risks taking into account all the information' when
    making decisions about the future.

    a very interesting bias.
