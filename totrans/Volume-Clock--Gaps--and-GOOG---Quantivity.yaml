    While earnings were marginally interesting, much more amusing was the corresponding
    hiccup in intraday trading. This event provides an opportunity to dig into TAQ
    data, view through a HFT lens, and build intuition from some elegant ideas due
    to Mendelbrot, Clark, and Ané.

- en: Rather than a single print gap, the price action evolved more slowly over 12:30
    to 12:40\. The spread quickly expanded after 12:30, presumably driven by the jump
    in volume subsequent to disclosure. A 5,000 share trade printed shortly after
    12:32, as spreads were beginning to stabilize. This precipitated some fear and
    greed, as market makers blew the spreads out to $4\. Spread dynamics after noon
    appear to be fairly typical response to uncertainty and toxicity, as the summary
    is qualitatively similar to other similar events such as the morning after Bear
    in 2008.

    let’s view it through a different lens—following the intuition from Mandelbrot
    (1963), Clark (1971), and most recently Easley *et al.* (2012).

    consistent with Figure 1 from Clark (1971) and Exhibit 2 from Easley *et al.*
    (2012). Although certainly leptokurtic, the distributions are not too dissimilar
    from normal.

- en: Now, ignore chronological time and instead consider the trades from the perspective
    of a *clock based on volume of shares traded over the day*. In other words, generate
    a new process defined as the sequence of prices coinciding with shares traded
    on equal-sized partitions of total volume over the day. This process generates
    a “volume clock” for the trades, in doing so exemplifying a beautiful time-series
    transformation.

    is plotted above in black (with dashed corresponding normal fit), assuming partition
    size of 50\. This exhibits distribution characteristics consistent with Exhibit
    2 from Easley *et al.* (2012).

    Oct 19\. The normal fits for both 5-min bars (blue) and volume clock (black) are
    especially interesting, as they have little resemblance to their corresponding
    kernel estimates. Care is required for trading on days that look like this.

    stochastic processes (originally due to Bochner (1960)). Ané and Geman (2000)
    apply a bit more sophistication, including arguing in favor of cumulative transaction
    count rather than cumulative traded volume. Perhaps worth a follow-up post to
    see if this still makes sense, given current era of predominantly algorithmic
    program trading.
