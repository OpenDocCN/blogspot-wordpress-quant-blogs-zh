    famous painting seems to be smiling. Look again and her smile fades. When it next
    reappears, it is a different sort of smile. Leonardo da Vinci achieved this ambiguous
    effect with the use of sfumato, where he blurred the lines around Mona Lisa’s
    face. No matter how many times you look, you are unsure quite what is happening.

    something different. After chaos in the banking industry, many analysts are now
    convinced that the world economy is heading for a “hard-landing” recession. Few
    seem to expect a “no-landing” scenario, in which the economy remains untroubled
    by rising interest rates—a fashionable opinion just weeks ago, and one which itself
    supplanted a common view late last year that a mild recession was certain.
