    at new highs.  The basic finding was that when the market closed at a short-term
    high on a Fed Day, then it was likely to pull back over the next few days.  But
    when it closed at a long-term high, then the rally was likely to continue.  Below
    is a study from the Guide that last appeared in the 9/14/12 blog.
