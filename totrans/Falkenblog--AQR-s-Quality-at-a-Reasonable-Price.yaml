    value has nice properties, and the Sharpe maximizing combination is about 70%
    quality, 30% value.  This is coming from Asness, who is a pretty big value proponent,
    so I think this is rather telling (value losing it's pre-eminence!).

- en: Their quality metric has a kitchen-sink aspect to it, with about 20 ratios that
    go into those 4 different groupings.  I could imagine many people would find this
    an attractive framework to develop and tweak their own quality metric, substituting
    for various ratios, or subtle changes to the functional form.  Haugen and Baker's

- en: By construction their return-generating metric seems patently 'anti-risk', as
    quality implies 'low risk'. The risk-begets-return theory obviously has a lot
    of intuition, because empirically it's counterfactual when not irrelevant.  I
    think if you divided the data described by asset pricing theory into 'puzzles'
    and 'consistent', it's mainly puzzles.
