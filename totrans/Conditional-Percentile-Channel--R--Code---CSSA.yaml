    for [Conditional Percentile Channels](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2015/02/20/conditional-percentile-channels/
    "Conditional Percentile Channels") is now available on Michael Kapler’s Systematic
    Investor [blog](http://systematicinvestor.github.io/Conditional-Channel-Breakout/).
    The original code was contributed by long-time reader Pierre Chretien and subsequently
    verified by Michael. Pierre has been generous enough to share code from the blog
    material several times over the past few years. Thank you both for sharing this
    code with our readers!
