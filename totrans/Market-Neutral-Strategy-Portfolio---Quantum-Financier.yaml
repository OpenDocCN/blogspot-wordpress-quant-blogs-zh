    obtaining market neutrality for a portfolio of strategy. As mentioned in last
    post, investors can trade many strategies with conflicting signals. For this particular
    example, imagine an investor that trades two strategies; a RSI2 and the 50-200
    moving average crossover on the S&P 500\. You can imagine that the signals from
    these strategies are going to be conflicting. The RSI2 is a really short-term
    strategy with a high turnover, while the so termed “golden cross” is a polar opposite
    very slow moving low frequency strategy. Also assume this investor allocate 50%
    of his capital to both strategy.

    want to short or long some SPY in order to remain market neutral. To accomplish
    this we will use the commonly used simple linear regression and the slightly more
    robust quantile regression.

    returns series to obtain the prescribed hedge ratio approximated by the regression
    coefficient. Now everyone is likely familiar with the linear regression so I will
    skip the intro. However the quantile regression is not as mainstream. It simply
    estimates the tau(![\tau](img/8680be82b79a2cba9a9bfe41df61f6d3.png))-th conditional
    quantile regression function, and give the expected value based on the current
    quantile (tau) of the predictor variables. The premise for using quantile regression
    is that we expect the regression coefficients to vary depending on the level of
    the predictor variable. Note that in this experiment I used the linear quantile
    regression but there exists a non-linear version of it.

    ratio calculation. They represent the equity curves of the portfolio traded with
    the market neutral long/short hedge as prescribed by the regression coefficient.
    A note of caution here, doing this will reduce returns however, it also reduces
    volatility.

- en: I think this result is interesting in a couple of ways. But first I want to
    look if market neutrality is effectively obtained. As explained in last post,
    we often say we are market neutral if our beta is zero. Readers that have experimented
    with this concept know that the beta is never going to be strictly zero, but will
    oscillate around it. To test whether or not my goal was accomplished I used a
    simple t-test for the 60 day rolling mean of the observed beta. Alternatively,
    I could have used a more robust bootstrap test but I wanted to keep things simple.
    The t-test confirmed that the observed beta was effectively not different from
    zero and that we obtained theoretical market neutrality with both methods.

    which tested slightly better. I think there is value in the quantile regression
    when considering market neutrality as an objective for a strategy or a portfolio
    of strategies. The dynamic linear modelling approach is left to the interested
    reader.
