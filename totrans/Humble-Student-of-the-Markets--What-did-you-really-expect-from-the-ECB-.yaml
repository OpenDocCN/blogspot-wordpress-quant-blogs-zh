    After Mario Draghi let it be known that the ECB would "do whatever it takes to
    preserve the euro", the market expected that an immediate announcement of bond
    buying of Spanish and Italian paper would follow. Instead, the ECB is an institution
    that considers, thinks, deliberates and debates before taking action. When the

    severe malfunctioning in the price formation process in the bond markets of euro
    area countries. Exceptionally high risk premia are observed in government bond
    prices in several countries and financial fragmentation hinders the effective
    working of monetary policy. Risk premia that are related to fears of the reversibility
    of the euro are unacceptable, and they need to be addressed in a fundamental manner.
    The euro is irreversible.

    recent years, further decisive and urgent steps need to be taken to improve competitiveness.
    From 2009 to 2011, euro area countries, on average, reduced the deficit-to-GDP
    ratio by 2.3 percentage points, and the primary deficit improved by about 2½ percentage
    points. Fiscal adjustment in the euro area is continuing in 2012, and it is indeed
    crucial that efforts are maintained to restore sound fiscal positions. At the
    same time, **structural reforms** are as essential as fiscal consolidation efforts
    and the measures to repair the financial sector. Some progress has also been made
    in this area. For example, unit labour costs and current account developments
    have started to undergo a correction process in most of the countries strongly
    affected by the crisis. However, further reform measures need to be implemented
    swiftly and decisively. Product market reforms to foster competitiveness and the
    creation of efficient and flexible labour markets are preconditions for the unwinding
    of existing imbalances and the achievement of robust, sustainable growth. It is
    now crucial that Member States implement their country-specific recommendations
    with determination.
