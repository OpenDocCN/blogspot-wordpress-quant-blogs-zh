    batting average in the last three years. I have marked with blue vertical lines
    past instances where two of the three components have flashed buy signals and
    in red vertical lines past instances where all three components have simultaneously
    flashed buy at the same time.

    go again with another buy signal a mere six trading days later.

    During prolonged declines such as the ones we saw in 2010 and 2011, oversold models
    don`t necessarily work all the time because oversold markets can get more oversold.

    a key support level. However, RSI(5) is in oversold territory and showing a positive
    divergence. At the same time, RSI(14) is at the bottom of its 2015 range and stubbornly
    refuses to get oversold, suggesting that it is nearing a support level and may
    be due for a bounce.

    dma could be construed as a technical break and this could be the start of a cascade
    pointing to much lower prices. On the other hand, technical and sentiment indicators
    are flashing oversold signals which suggests that, even if we take the position
    that the intermediate trend is down, the market may need to stage an oversold
    rally first before falling further.

    the first logical resistance would be the 50 dma at about the 2100 level, but
    let`s take this one step at a time. Next week is option expiry week, which tends
    to lend an upward bias to stock prices. On the other hand, we do have the tiny
    detail that the EU may decide to blow up the Greek banking system this weekend,
    which is an event which could cause *ahem* a considerable reduction in global
    risk appetite.
