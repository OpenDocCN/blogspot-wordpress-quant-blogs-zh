- en: It's been three years since the financial crisis crippled the American economy,
    and much to the consternation of the general public and the demonstrators on Wall
    Street, there has not been a single prosecution of a high-ranking Wall Street
    executive or major financial firm even though fraud and financial misrepresentations
    played a significant role in the meltdown. We wanted to know why, so nine months
    ago we began looking for cases that might have prosecutorial merit. Tonight you'll
    hear about two of them. We begin with a woman named Eileen Foster, a senior executive
    at Countrywide Financial, one of the epicenters of the crisis.
