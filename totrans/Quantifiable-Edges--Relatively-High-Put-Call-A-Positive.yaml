- en: The market finally broke its consolidation on Wednesday. One intermediate-term
    positive I’m seeing right now is the action in the CBOE put/call ratio. Today
    it closed at 1.16\. Over the last 4 days it has averaged 1.12\. High put/call
    ratios are normally associated with market selloffs, yet the market made a 20-day
    high as recently as Monday.

    traders, which is why they are more common during selloffs than during upmoves.
    I looked back to check other times when the 4-day put/call ratio was above 1.10
    and the market was within three days of a 20-day high. Looking back to 1995 I
    only found three instances: 8/23/06, 2/23/07, and 5/25/07.'

- en: August 23, 2006 was a great buying opportunity both short and long-term. It
    marked a low point and the market rallied for several months following that.

    before the market collapsed over 3.5% on February 27th.

    of June.

- en: Not much to learn from these three examples. It should be noted, though that
    the put/call ratio has been significantly higher over the past couple of years
    than it was in the beginning of the decade. To adjust for this I normalized the
    data by using the 100-day moving average.

- en: I once again looked at any time the S&P 500 had made at least a 20-day high
    in the last 3 days. This time I only required that the four-day average put/call
    ratio was above its 100-day moving average. After eliminating overlap and looking
    out at least 20-days I found 47 instances going back to 1995\. 33 of these led
    to positive returns over the next 20 days and 14 of them led to declines – a 70%
    win rate. The average win was 2.7% and the average loss was 2.5%. The average
    trade was 1.1%. Not overwhelming numbers by any stretch but not bad, especially
    considering the market was already at a 20-day high.

- en: In all I would consider the relatively high put/call ratios we are currently
    seeing a positive. They may help to provide a “wall of worry” for the market to
    climb.
