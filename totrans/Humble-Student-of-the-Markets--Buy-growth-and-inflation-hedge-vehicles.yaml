  prefs: []

- en: The upside potential can be quite high. Consider, for example, the resource
    heavy Canadian market as measured by the TSX Composite. One analog might be to
    think about is the market reaction after the Lehman Crisis of 2008\. The Trend
    Model correctly moved to a defensive "deflation" reading in August 2008 and went
    "neutral" in late March 2009, about three weeks after the March bottom. It later
    moved to an aggressive "asset inflation" reading in August 2009.

    2011, but Eurogeddon did not materialize. It went "neutral" in mid-January 2012
    and flashed an aggressive "asset inflation" signal last week.

    the market peak in early 2011, the move was roughly 6,000 points and roughly 4,000
    points from the "asset inflation" signal in August 2009\. So how far up can the
    market move up this time?

    high-beta and recovery candidate US Broker-Dealer Index (XBD) relative to the
    stock market in the wake of the Lehman Crisis. From the bottom in 2008 to the
    peak in 2009, the XBD staged a relative rally of close to 60%.
