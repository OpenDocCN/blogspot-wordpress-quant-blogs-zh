    above their 50 dma surged from below 5% at the June low to over 90% in mid-August.
    In the past, such strong price momentum has always signaled the start of a new
    equity bull.

    tone when the Fed and other central bankers signaled their determination to raise
    interest rates and warned about pain ahead. The reversal has been so dramatic
    that the percentage of S&P 500 stocks above their 20 dma has retreated to under
    10%.
