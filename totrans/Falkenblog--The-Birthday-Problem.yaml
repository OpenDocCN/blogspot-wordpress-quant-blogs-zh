    by noting that some people share 7 o 13 gene loci at about 1 million times the
    frequency presented, a large error. But the error was the researcher. The odds
    are for a particular set of 13 loci sharing 9 chromosomes. But state crime lab
    analyst Kathryn Troyer looked at all the combinations of men in a group of 63,000,
    giving her about 2 billion pairs, and thought she discovered a massive rejection
    of the hypothesis. She also appears to have looked at many different sets of 13
    loci, and ignored the fact that some prisoners are related.
