    a continuum ranging from “good” to “bad.” Judgments of risk and return are derived
    from this unidimensional attitudinal continuum. If an asset is perceived as good,
    it will be judged to have both high return and low risk, whereas if it is perceived
    as bad, it will be judged to have both low return and high risk.

    positively correlated, as conventionally predicted. But when judging unfamiliar
    stocks, analysts tended to judge the stocks as if they were generally good or
    generally bad - low risk and high returns, or high risk and low returns. Ganzach
    presents some surveys, testing a bunch of MBAs familiar with the CAPM. He basically
    argues that when people really understand an asset, they then apply the standard
    CAPM reasoning (expected return inversely related to risk), and worked backward
    from the intitial 'good asset' to 'low return' (or from 'bad' to 'high'), using
    their theoretical training. The author assumed without much note the CAPM theory
    as correct. I see it as applying a theory that is severely contradicted by the
    data, solely because it is so well believed by conventional wisdom.

    we know that high cashflow and low volatility are correlated with higher-than-average
    returns, but there's no dominant theory for that.

    were propitious for stocks, they would have high returns and low risk. Forecasting
    the overall market is something difficult for anyone, so individuals would likely
    behave as if this were an 'unfamiliar' asset play.

    invariably mixed: everything has pros and cons. To see a pattern within this overload
    of data requires a theory, and the dominant one in this case is that a ''good''
    company is not risky (eg, high profits, low volatility), so its return therefore
    should be low.'

    we figure more knowledge should increase our understanding of whatever we are
    examining. This too, as a generalization, is true. All theories are wrong, some
    are useful, so the hope is that your theory is of the latter sort. In these cases,
    the more one knows, the more one is lured into applying their theoretical knowledge,
    and then the issue is whether or not their underlying theory is either irrelevant
    or has a sign error. Unfortunately, a lot of conventional theories are profoundly
    wrong.

    are pretty good at picking up social cues, sensing when their dog is hungry, but
    the more abstract the worse it gets. Our wet neural nets simply weren't optimized
    for this kind of thing, which is why common sense among experts is less frequent
    than what one thinks greater learning should bring. We are often led astray by
    theories that tend to tell comforting stories, or that contain bad analogies,
    faulty extrapolations, or omitted variables biases. We can't avoid generalizing
    at some level, just as we can't look at data and see anything without some kind
    of theory. But it's a useful generalization that when your source is an academic
