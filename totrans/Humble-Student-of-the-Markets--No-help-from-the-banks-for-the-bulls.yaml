    indication of rising systemic risk, consistent with a Russia Crisis or Lehman

    well behaved. While the BKX, which is heavily weighted with Too-Big-To-Fail (TBTF)
    banks, had broken down on a relative basis, the Regional Bank Index had held steady.
    Now the Regionals have broken down and they are having trouble rallying above
    relative resistance.

    The Europeans banks are in a relative downtrend and they have broken a major relative
    support line. The relative ratio is now at all time lows - a sign of trouble.
