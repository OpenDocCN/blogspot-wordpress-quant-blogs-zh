- en: '**Abstract:** Due to its gaseous form, and therefore low energy density, pipeline
    natural gas has traditionally supplied nearby regional markets which have been
    historically isolated from each other. Regional markets have traditionally had
    their own supply-demand balances, contractual structures and gas price formation
    mechanisms. This model is now under threat. With the growth of liquefied natural
    gas (LNG) supply which is increasingly flexible in terms of destination, regional
    markets are becoming progressively more connected.  A decade ago, when the LNG
    industry was based exclusively on long-term take-or-pay contracts and the number
    of market players was limited, the impact of price signals, if any, was weak.
    The liquidity of the "flexible" LNG market has increased in tandem with the growth
    in the number of LNG producing and consuming countries, the appearance of some
    uncommitted volumes of LNG and development of arbitrage activity. LNG arbitrage
    is a new pattern of gas trade still in an embryonic stage of development. Few
    outside the LNG industry or even outside LNG trading circles understand the term
    "LNG arbitrage" let alone the specific mechanisms. One of the goals of this paper
    is to establish a clear definition of LNG arbitrage and distinguish it from other
    trading activities which superficially appear similar.'

    have created opportunities for LNG arbitrage to take place. However, the scale
    of this type of trading has been constrained to date and has not led to demonstrable
    gas price convergence between markets. The second aim of the paper is an analysis
    of the main barriers to the growth of the LNG arbitrage market.

- en: Research for this paper has enabled a framework of barriers and conditions for
    LNG arbitrage to be developed. According to this framework there are four necessary
    conditions for an arbitrage transaction to take place.  Barriers, which deter
    arbitrage, can be divided into four groups. Analysis of the barriers has shown
    that some constrain arbitrage on the global level while others are more locally
    focussed (sic). Some barriers strongly preclude arbitrage activity while others
    merely make it more challenging.

    realignments it has ever seen - China, long a net exporter of coal, suddenly imported
    a record-smashing 126 Mt tons (103 Mt net). This inversion of China''s role in
    global coal markets meant that Chinese imports accounted for nearly 15% of all
    globally traded coal, and China became the focal point of global demand as traditional
    import markets like Europe and Japan stagnated in the wake of the financial crisis. 
    The middle kingdom''s appetite for imported coal seems insatiable, and the "China
    Factor" appears to have ushered in a new paradigm for the global coal market.'

    out 2.96 Bt of production in 2009, backed up by 114.5 Bt of reserves.  While the
    world's other fastest growing importer, India, is plagued by a growing gap between
    coal supply and power demand that it is unable to fill domestically, this is not
    the case in China.  The spike in Chinese demand for imported coal is therefore
    a more complex (and less easily predictable) phenomenon that requires careful
    examination if the world is to understand what impact China might have on global
    energy markets in the coming decade.
