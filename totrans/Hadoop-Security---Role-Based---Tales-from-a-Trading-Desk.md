## Hadoop Security – Role Based

[Cloudera](http://www.informationweek.com/big-data/software-platforms/cloudera-brings-role-based-security-to-hadoop/d/d-id/1110903) offer a number of interesting blog [articles](http://blog.cloudera.com/blog/category/security-2/) on Hadoop security – Impala using [Apache](https://blogs.apache.org/sentry/) [Sentry](http://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2014/03/how-to-implement-role-based-security-in-impala-using-apache-sentry/).  From an [enterprise](http://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2013/07/with-sentry-cloudera-fills-hadoops-enterprise-security-gap/) perspective, creation of a data [lake](http://hortonworks.com/blog/enterprise-hadoop-journey-data-lake/) will inevitably require a clean security approach from day 1.
