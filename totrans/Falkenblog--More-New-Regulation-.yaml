    of pages, and you have to initial it in 17 places, so many none are read by your
    average borrower. So now we will have to initial in 34 places. If the warning
    light is always flashing, people ignore it. But to prioritize implies understanding
    the relative magnitudes of risk, and that is outside their scope. This doesn't
    change anything.

- en: Getting rid of the OTS, and moving them into the Fed? Yawn. Everyone gets new
    business cards. The new Consumer Financial Protection Agency can now "enforce
    rules across a slew of financial products", and chances are these will involve
    a lot of busy work, mercilessly slamming anyone trying to sell a derivative that
    no longer has a market. They will probably also prevent financial institutions
    from diversifying their product base, making friend with industry lobbyists eager
    to prevent competition, all in the name of preventing another systemic collapse.
    But they will also now micromanage Community Reinvestment Act requirements, which
    surely had absolutely nothing to do with this crisis.

- en: Regulator shopping, agency rating shopping, are all a sideshow. Sure they are
    bad, but it didn't matter because no regulators or investors thought those mortgage
    innovations had any risk. It wasn't like evil guys in suits were manipulating
    the system, the system was lending too much because it was thought to be profitable,
    safe, and morally good. It's like blaming binge drinking on beer commercials.
    Sure some knew it was a train wreck, but they were lonely voices, and giving Washington
    more power would have done zero back in 2006 because there was no large support
    for rolling back the insane mortgage underwriting standards that were implicitly
    predicated on home prices not falling.
