    I chronicled the first year of the iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN, known
    to most by its ticker symbol, [VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX).
    At the time, I noted that VXX had fallen 68.4% in its first year and made the
    prediction, “I expect VXX to perform better relative to the VIX in its second
    year than it did in its first year, though admittedly this is not a very high
    bar to clear.”'

    than in its first year. In spite of the fact that VXX rallied 8.4% on Friday to
    close out the second year on a high note, its performance in the second year slipped
    to -74.6%, giving the ETN the dubious distinction of having fallen 92% since its
    launch two years ago.

    these past two years, let me go on record as saying that VXX does exactly what
    it sets out to do: capture a portfolio of [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures)
    with a constant maturity of 30 days, with daily rolling used in order to achieve
    the constant maturity. As detailed in the links below and in many other places
    in this blog, it is the daily rolling in the face of persistent [contango](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/contango)
    which triggers negative [roll yield](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/roll%20yield)
    and acts as a drag on the price of VXX. In fact, VIX futures contango has been
    extremely elevated since the end of August, which largely explains why VXX lost
    74.6% in the past year when the VIX declined only 18.6%. To compare the contango
    impact of the second year of VXX with the first year, all one needs to know is
    that in the first year VIX outperformed VXX by 26.2%, while in the year just concluded,
    VIX outperformed VXX by a whopping 56.0%.'

    the short-term, VXX is a viable long volatility play, as evidenced by Friday’s
    8.4% gain. When the VIX futures curve slides from contango to [backwardation](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/backwardation),
    VXX can also be an attractive trade. The problems on the long side begin when
    investors utilize holding periods of more than a couple of days. In the long run,
    volatility is [mean-reverting](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/mean%20reversion)
    and offers no natural directional advantage. For this reason, the longer the holding
    period, the more VXX trades become [term structure](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/term%20structure)
    rather than directional trades, with the term structure favoring contango over
    backwardation approximately 75% of the time.

    VXX will perform better relative to the VIX in the coming year than it has in
    the past year.'
