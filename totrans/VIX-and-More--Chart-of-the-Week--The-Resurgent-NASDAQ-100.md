# VIX and More: Chart of the Week: The Resurgent NASDAQ-100

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/04/chart-of-week-resurgent-nasdaq-100.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/04/chart-of-week-resurgent-nasdaq-100.html#0001-01-01)

Technology is back and large cap technology is helping to lead the recent rebound in equities.

Even after a four week rally, 2009 has been mostly a sea of red. In fact, the two headline indices, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 index, are down 8.65% and 6.73% so far in 2009\. Neither large caps nor small caps are performing particularly well, with the large cap S&P 100 (OEX) down 8.27% and the small cap Russell 2000 (RUT) down 8.67% year to date.

The technology-heavy NASDAQ has been a very different story, with both the NASDAQ composite index (+2.84%) and NASDAQ-100 (+8.63%) in the green.

In the [chart of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week) below, I have highlighted the NASDAQ-100 index ([NDX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/NDX)), which closed at its highest level since early November on Friday, following a strong earnings report and increased guidance from Research in Motion ([RIMM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/RIMM)). The NDX is a weighted index of the largest 100 companies in the NASDAQ, as measured by market capitalization. As such, the largest weightings read like a who’s who list of large technology companies: Microsoft ([MSFT](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/MSFT)); Google ([GOOG](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/GOOG)); Cisco ([CSCO](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/CSCO)); Apple ([AAPL](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/AAPL)); Oracle ([ORCL](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/ORCL)); Intel ([INTC](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/INTC)); Qualcomm ([QCOM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/QCOM)); etc.

Whether or not the resurgent NDX can continue to rally and retrace its steep drop from September and October will go a long way toward determining if the broader markets will be able to gain enough momentum to also finish 2009 in the green.
