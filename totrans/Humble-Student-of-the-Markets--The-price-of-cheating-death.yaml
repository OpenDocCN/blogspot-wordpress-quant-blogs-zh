    undiscovered investment opportunities. One of my nominations for undiscovered
    investment theme was life extension technology. In October 2009, the respected

    (they were called microcomputers back then as IBM didn’t introduce the PC until
    August 1981), would be the growth industry of the future. I told anyone who listened
    that the microcomputer would be as common as the office photocopier in five years.
    I was wrong, it was more common than the photocopier as there were multiple PCs
    in most offices.

    Commodore, Tandy (Radio Shack) and Atari, which was a division of Warner Communications.
    Apple hadn’t gone public yet and hadn’t gotten into the business at the time.
    Microsoft was just a small private concern.

    retirement, then the extension of even a few years of expected lifespan would
    increase pension fund liabilities.

    If you are paying premiums based on an expected life expectancy of, say 78 years,
    and you die at 85, then you will have overpaid for insurance protection. The life
    insurance company wins, at least from a financial viewpoint. Multiple that by
    several million people and you get an idea of the gains the industry faces.
