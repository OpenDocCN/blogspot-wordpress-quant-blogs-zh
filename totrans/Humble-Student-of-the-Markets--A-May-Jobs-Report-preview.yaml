    the Fed has no choice but to cut rates. The markets adopted a risk-off posture
    as a consequence of Trump`s announcement that he plans to impose tariffs on Mexico. The
    entire Treasury yield curve, with the exception of the very long end at 30-years,
    is at or below the Fed Funds target rate. The market is now anticipating between
    two and three quarter point rate cuts by the end of 2019.

    cut rates to maintain the expansion.** The Fed has so far resisted this story,
    but the odds favor them moving in this direction. The simple fact is that the
    Fed reacts systematically to a changing forecast. Financial markets are signaling
    the the growth forecast will worsen enough, or that the risks to the growth forecast
    will become sufficiently one-sided, that the Fed will have to act. The Fed isn’t
    there yet, but they will not be able to resist forever.'

    and other matters. We do not know how or when these issues will be resolved. We
    are closely monitoring the implications of these developments for the U.S. economic
    outlook and, as always, we will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with
    a strong labor market and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent objective.

    he said Thursday after a speech to the Economics Club of New York. “If we saw
    a downside risk to the outlook, then that would be a factor that could call for
    a more accommodative policy. So that’s definitely something in the risk-management
    area that we would think about.”

    could be a trigger for the Fed to cut rates if it felt the need to act preemptively,
    with inflation already below the central bank’s 2 percent target. The Fed’s preferred
    price index, minus food and energy, rose 1.6% for the 12 months through March,
    and analysts expect the same number from the April report due Friday.
