    their consensus analyst earnings estimates. This is slightly below the 63% that
    beat estimates in a typical full earnings season and the 67% that beat in a typical
    earnings “preseason”. Historically, when a higher-than-average percentage of companies
    beat their estimates in the preseason, more companies than average beat their
    estimates throughout the full earnings season 70% of the time, and vice versa.
    ***This suggests that third-quarter earnings results are unlikely to exceed expectations
    at an abnormally high rate. However, the fact that the preseason beat rate is
    very close to the average suggests that results will probably not be much worse
    than average either. ***
