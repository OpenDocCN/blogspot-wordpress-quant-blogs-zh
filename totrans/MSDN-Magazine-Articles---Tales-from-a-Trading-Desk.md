## MSDN Magazine Articles

Life is so much easier since Microsoft took over the MSDN Magazine and start publishing it on the web – I can access back issues easily, and I don’t have to wait for the slow airmail to reach London. This month’s magazine has a number of excellent articles. For a start there is [Matt Pietrek](http://blogs.msdn.com/matt_pietrek/) [X64 Primer](http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/06/05/x64/) – Matt always writes cool articles that allow software engineers to expand there knowledge of Windows development irrespective of how many years they’ve been developing software. Stephen Toub has a good article on [MDA’s](http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/06/05/BugBash/) – I can only hope that as per Stephen’s last paragraph, custom MDA’s will be supported in CLR 3.0\. I could be wrong, but I don’t think I’ve seen an MSDN magazine article from [Lutz Roeder](http://aisto.com/roeder/frontier/) – pretty sure if Lutz wrote one, it would be worth a read.
