  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Okun noted that, because of ongoing increases in the size of the labor force
    and in the level of productivity, real GDP growth close to the rate of growth
    of its potential is normally required just to hold the unemployment rate steady.
    To reduce the unemployment rate, therefore, the economy must grow at a pace above
    its potential. More specifically, according to currently accepted versions of
    Okun's law, to achieve a 1 percentage point decline in the unemployment rate in
    the course of a year, real GDP must grow approximately 2 percentage points faster
    than the rate of growth of potential GDP over that period. ***So, for illustration,***
    ***if the potential rate of GDP growth is 2 percent, Okun's law says that GDP
    must grow at about a 4 percent rate for one year to achieve a 1 percentage point
    reduction in the rate of unemployment.***

    the extent that this reversal has been completed, further significant improvements
    in the unemployment rate will likely require a more-rapid expansion of production
    and demand from consumers and businesses, a process that can be supported by continued
    accommodative policies.'

    month's data, especially when there is a 90% chance that the actual number lies
    between 20K and 220K. Doves will focus on the falling employment number, while
    hawks will focus on the falling UNemployment number. What if the next month's
