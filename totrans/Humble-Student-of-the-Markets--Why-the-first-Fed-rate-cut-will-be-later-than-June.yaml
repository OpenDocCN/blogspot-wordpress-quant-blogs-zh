    in the labour market would be a reason to hold off on rate cuts. Powell’s response
    was, “No, not all by itself no.”

  zh: 作为一个例子，纽约时报的Jenna Smialek询问劳动力市场的加强是否会是延迟降息的原因。鲍威尔的回答是，“不，本身并不是。”
- en: Even as Powell sounded a dovish tone, and markets took a risk-on tone as a relief
    that the median dot plot is still forecasting three rate cuts for 2024, not all
    is dovish within the FOMC. An analysis of how the 2024 dot plot evolved between
    December and March shows a mildly hawkish tone. Even though the median stayed
    at three cuts, the average fell and the distribution became far less dovish than
    the December projections.

  zh: 即使鲍威尔发表了鸽派言论，市场也采取了风险偏好态度，作为一种缓解，因为中间的点状图仍然预测2024年将有三项降息，并非FOMC内部的全部都是鸽派。分析12月和3月之间2024年的点状图演变显示了一种轻微的鹰派态度。尽管中间值保持在三次降息不变，但平均值下降，分布比12月的预测要少得多。

    needs to achieve a consensus for a rate cutting decision, it was be as difficult

  zh: 美联储委员会个别成员的观点变得更加鹰派。如果鲍威尔需要为降息决策达成共识，这将像赶猫一样困难。
