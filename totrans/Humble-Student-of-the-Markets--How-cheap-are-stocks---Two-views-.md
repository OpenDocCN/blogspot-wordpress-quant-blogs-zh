# Humble Student of the Markets: How cheap are stocks? (Two views)

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2012/11/how-cheap-are-stocks-two-views.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2012/11/how-cheap-are-stocks-two-views.html#0001-01-01)

In the current low-yield environment, money has been piling into the income investment theme by driving down the yields on anything that has a yield. In particular, dividend paying stocks have been a major beneficiary of this trend. Recently, Morgan Stanley highlighted how far this investment mania has run in their 2013 investment outlook document by pointing out the earnings yield on stocks is now higher than high-yield bonds (via

).

Stocks are cheap and junk bonds are expensive. Right?

My view is that. on a relative valuation basis, that view is correct. Stocks are cheap compared to high-yield bonds, but they aren't screamingly cheap on an absolute basis. Consider this chart of the market cap to GDP ratio (via

[VectorGrader](http://www.vectorgrader.com/indicators/market-cap-gdp)

), which is a proxy for the Price to Sales ratio. (A related ratio, namely the market cap to GNP, is one of

[Warren Buffett's favorite valuation metrics](http://pragcap.com/buffetts-favorite-valuation-metric-says)

.) Note how the ratio, shown on the top panel, is falling and still hasn't gotten back to its long term average and it is nowhere near levels where secular bull markets tend to begin. As well, falling market cap to GDP eras tend to be associated with secular bear markets, where stock prices (bottom panel) tend to be range-bound.

These conditions suggest that the income theme is overdone, but stocks aren't terribly cheap. Investors should adjust their return expectations accordingly.
