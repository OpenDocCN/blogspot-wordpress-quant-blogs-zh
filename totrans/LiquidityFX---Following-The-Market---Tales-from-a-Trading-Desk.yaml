- en: smartTrade’s press [release](http://low-latency.com/article/smarttrade-technologies-announces-new-components-liquidityfx)
    on [LiquidityFX](http://www.smart-trade.net/liquidity-FX.html) highlights one
    of the key drivers in the FX space over the last time period – “regional financial
    institutions”.  I suspect smartTrade is not talking Tier-1 banks here 🙂 , but
    the smaller tier 2 and 3 banks, who’s customer based is obviously different to
    the major players, and ripe for electronic trading improvements.  From a technology
    perspective, it would be interesting to know what percentage of the overall regional
    financial institution market opts for hosted/managed solution (aka cloud) vs software
    package (self install) vs appliance.   I recall [Kaazing](http://kaazing.com/)
    used to offer an appliance, but due to demand I believe it was discontinued. 
    However, in the case of smartTrade, given the larger product offering they provide,
    and knowing the tier 2/3 market a little 😉 , an appliance may have a better take
    up.
