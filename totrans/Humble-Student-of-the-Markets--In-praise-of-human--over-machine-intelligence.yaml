    Capitol Hill since becoming the Fed's leader in February, said provisions in a
    recently introduced House bill would lead to greater political meddling in the
    Fed's affairs, curtailing its independence and constraining the ability of policy

    the appropriate level for its benchmark short-term interest rate, which influences
    other borrowing costs across the economy. The bill's proponents cite as an example
    the so-called Taylor rule, devised by Stanford University economics professor
    John Taylor, which calculates the ideal level of the rate based on changes in
    several economic variables.

    rate policy on rules versus discretion—that is, whether they should adhere to
    a mathematical formula or maintain some flexibility to respond based on circumstances
    and judgment. Mr. Taylor and some Fed officials are in the first camp, saying
    rules-based policy-making creates more predictability and transparency, leading
    to better economic outcomes. Ms. Yellen and other Fed officials are in the latter
    camp. She said Wednesday that the recent recession would have been deeper if the
    Fed had stuck closely to the Taylor rule.
