    be run by a computer. It was likely with Friedman's views in mind that Republican
    legislators challenged Janet Yellen to conduct monetary policy using a preset

- en: Ms. Yellen, responding to some of the toughest questioning she has faced on
    Capitol Hill since becoming the Fed's leader in February, said provisions in a
    recently introduced House bill would lead to greater political meddling in the
    Fed's affairs, curtailing its independence and constraining the ability of policy
    makers to manage crises.

- en: The House bill would require the Fed to adopt a mathematical formula for determining
    the appropriate level for its benchmark short-term interest rate, which influences
    other borrowing costs across the economy. The bill's proponents cite as an example
    the so-called Taylor rule, devised by Stanford University economics professor
    John Taylor, which calculates the ideal level of the rate based on changes in
    several economic variables.

- en: Economists have been debating for years the relative merits of basing interest
    rate policy on rules versus discretion—that is, whether they should adhere to
    a mathematical formula or maintain some flexibility to respond based on circumstances
    and judgment. Mr. Taylor and some Fed officials are in the first camp, saying
    rules-based policy-making creates more predictability and transparency, leading
    to better economic outcomes. Ms. Yellen and other Fed officials are in the latter
    camp. She said Wednesday that the recent recession would have been deeper if the
    Fed had stuck closely to the Taylor rule.

    in my LinkedIn profile. I don't agree with Yellen on a number of issues (more
    in a future post), but human intelligence is far more flexible than rules-based
    machine intelligence and you need human oversight over machine intelligence.
