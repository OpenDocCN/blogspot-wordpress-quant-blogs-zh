    of the low-volume rallies we are seeing will often lead to a pullback. It struck
    me that perhaps it might be worth looking at low-volume rallies in a slightly
    different way.

    days are basically days where the market sells off on relatively high volume.
    The theory is that when clusters of these days are seen near a market high it
    suggests an intermediate-term selloff is likely to ensue. Back in August I posted
    a study that examined this.

    rather than looking for further selling.

    parameters.

    looking at a market that typically rose following such clusters.

    days that rose on volume that was lower than the pervious day’s volume. Here’s
    how those results came out.

    upside as the distribution day clusters were. This isn’t terribly surprising since
    many of the volume-related studies we see suggesting downside are due to low-volume
    rises rather than high-volume declines.

    line of thought in the future.
