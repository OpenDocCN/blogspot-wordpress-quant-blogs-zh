    affecting companies and the competitive environment. He observed that net margins
    have been elevated in the last few years. Generally, when margins are high, an
    industry attracts new entrants who come in and eventually drive down margins.
    One explanation advanced is that in a "winner take all" economy, there are substantial

  zh: 昨天我写了一篇关于“赢者通吃”经济如何影响公司及竞争环境的精彩文章。他观察到，近几年来净利率一直很高。通常情况下，当利润率很高时，一个行业会吸引新的进入者，他们最终会降低利润率。一个被提出的解释是，在“赢者通吃”的经济中，存在大量的进入壁垒：
- en: The possibility that increased barriers to entry represent the primary causal
    factor behind the observed profit margin increase is supported by the fact that
    the increase has not been broad-based, as would be expected if it were a simple
    consequence of weak labor bargaining power, low interest rates, or some other
    generic factor associated with the corporate cost structure. Rather, it is concentrated
    in specific [sectors](http://www.philosophicaleconomics.com/2015/01/explosion/)–especially
    the technology sector–and in specifically dominant individual [large cap, blue-chip
    names](http://www.millennialinvest.com/blog/2015/1/26/more-on-profit-margins).

  zh: 增加进入壁垒是导致观察到的利润率增长的主要因果因素的可能性得到了支持，因为这种增长并不是广泛的，如果它是劳动力议价能力弱、低利率或与企业成本结构相关的其他一些普遍因素简单后果的话，我们本应预期它会广泛发生。相反，它集中在特定的[行业](http://www.philosophicaleconomics.com/2015/01/explosion/)——尤其是科技行业——以及特定的主导[大型市值、蓝筹股](http://www.millennialinvest.com/blog/2015/1/26/more-on-profit-margins)。

    of this piece. If a “Winner Take All” economy, where increased barriers to entry–first-mover
    barriers, network barriers, patent barriers, size barriers, tax-advantage barriers,
    regulatory barriers, and so on–have allowed an increasingly concentrated group
    of dominant companies to earn substantially higher profit margins and push up
    on the aggregate profit margin, is the main driver of the aggregate profit margin
    increase, then we should expect the following. If we separate the market into
    different tiers of profitability, we should expect the higher-tier companies to
    have seen larger increases in their profitability than the lower-tier companies.
    Increases in their profitability–at the expense of the lower tiers–would represent
    the “Winner” gradually “Taking All.”

  zh: 现在，有一个巧妙的方法来测试这个假设，这把我们带到了这篇文章的主题。如果“赢者通吃”的经济，其中增加的进入壁垒——先发制人壁垒、网络壁垒、专利壁垒、规模壁垒、税收优势壁垒、监管壁垒等等——已经允许一组越来越集中的主导公司赚取更高的利润率，并推动整体利润率的上升，是整体利润率增长的主要驱动力，那么我们应该预期以下情况。如果我们把市场分为不同层次的盈利能力，我们应该预期高层次的公司的盈利增长会比低层次的公司更大。他们盈利的增长——以低层次为代价——将代表“赢家”逐渐“通吃”。

  zh: 他找到了一个有趣的方式来测试这个假设：
- en: 'I recently asked my favorite blogger, the brilliant Patrick O’Shaughnessy of
    O’Shaugnessy Asset Management (Twitter: @millennial_inv, Blog: [http://www.investorfieldguide.com](http://www.investorfieldguide.com/)),
    to put the hypothesis to the test. So he separated the market into five different
    bins by profit margin, and then charted the profit margins of each bin from 1963
    to 2015\. Lo and behold, the results ended up fitting perfectly with the prediction.
    The profit margin increase of the last 20 years has not been broad-based, shared
    by all bins, but rather has been concentrated in the highest profit-margin bins.
    The dominant companies in those bins have seen their profit margins explode, while
    the companies in the lower-tier bins have seen little if any increase–and for
    some bins, an outright reduction.'

- en: Notice that the profit margins of the various bins moved roughly commensurately
    up until the late 1980s and early 1990s. At that point, something happened. The
    profit margins of the top bin proceeded to explode, rising by over 1000 basis
    points. The profit margins of the next two highest bins stayed roughly flat. And
    the profit margins of the two lowest bins actually fell–even as their labor and
    interest costs were supposedly reduced. Overall, the dispersion of profit margins
    grew dramatically–which is the hallmark sign of a “Winner Take All” economy.

    in "new economy" sectors like Technology and Financials, but not in commodity-related
    price-taking sectors like Energy and Materials, or regulated sectors like Utilities.
