    affecting companies and the competitive environment. He observed that net margins
    have been elevated in the last few years. Generally, when margins are high, an
    industry attracts new entrants who come in and eventually drive down margins.
    One explanation advanced is that in a "winner take all" economy, there are substantial
    barriers to entry:'

- en: The possibility that increased barriers to entry represent the primary causal
    factor behind the observed profit margin increase is supported by the fact that
    the increase has not been broad-based, as would be expected if it were a simple
    consequence of weak labor bargaining power, low interest rates, or some other
    generic factor associated with the corporate cost structure. Rather, it is concentrated
    in specific [sectors](http://www.philosophicaleconomics.com/2015/01/explosion/)–especially
    the technology sector–and in specifically dominant individual [large cap, blue-chip
    names](http://www.millennialinvest.com/blog/2015/1/26/more-on-profit-margins).

    of this piece. If a “Winner Take All” economy, where increased barriers to entry–first-mover
    barriers, network barriers, patent barriers, size barriers, tax-advantage barriers,
    regulatory barriers, and so on–have allowed an increasingly concentrated group
    of dominant companies to earn substantially higher profit margins and push up
    on the aggregate profit margin, is the main driver of the aggregate profit margin
    increase, then we should expect the following. If we separate the market into
    different tiers of profitability, we should expect the higher-tier companies to
    have seen larger increases in their profitability than the lower-tier companies.
    Increases in their profitability–at the expense of the lower tiers–would represent
    the “Winner” gradually “Taking All.”

    O’Shaugnessy Asset Management (Twitter: @millennial_inv, Blog: [http://www.investorfieldguide.com](http://www.investorfieldguide.com/)),
    to put the hypothesis to the test. So he separated the market into five different
    bins by profit margin, and then charted the profit margins of each bin from 1963
    to 2015\. Lo and behold, the results ended up fitting perfectly with the prediction.
    The profit margin increase of the last 20 years has not been broad-based, shared
    by all bins, but rather has been concentrated in the highest profit-margin bins.
    The dominant companies in those bins have seen their profit margins explode, while
    the companies in the lower-tier bins have seen little if any increase–and for
    some bins, an outright reduction.'

    up until the late 1980s and early 1990s. At that point, something happened. The
    profit margins of the top bin proceeded to explode, rising by over 1000 basis
    points. The profit margins of the next two highest bins stayed roughly flat. And
    the profit margins of the two lowest bins actually fell–even as their labor and
    interest costs were supposedly reduced. Overall, the dispersion of profit margins
    grew dramatically–which is the hallmark sign of a “Winner Take All” economy.

    in "new economy" sectors like Technology and Financials, but not in commodity-related
    price-taking sectors like Energy and Materials, or regulated sectors like Utilities.

    during the current recovery was because of the dominant effect of KBC in the economy.
    The latest post from Philosophical Economics more or less confirms that hypothesis.

    featured the asset-rich commodity producers, before that, Technology-Media-Telecom
    (TMT) was the dominant them. This cycle may feature the KBC, or intellectual property,
    companies.

    companies like Facebook and Apple normally come to mind. However, there is one
    hidden gem in the KBC investment theme that many may have missed - that's the
    biotechnology stocks. As the chart below shows, the biotechs have been in a multi-year
    relative uptrend against the market.

    be correct, then the biotech stocks may have a lot further to run than anyone
