- en: The S&P and Dow have both seen some choppy action over the last week. Each of
    the last 4 days has been a reversal of the previous day’s direction. Up, down,
    up, down, up. What’s unusual about the chop is that is has been accompanied by
    4 lower lows in the indices (Dow and S&P). In Larry Connors “How Markets Really
    Work”, he demonstrates that an edge typically exists when the market makes a series
    of lower lows or higher highs. The edge is in the opposite direction. In the book
    he also breaks it down by whether the market is trading above or below the 200-day
    moving average. In my own work I have found the concept of looking at consecutive
    lows or highs helpful as well.

    after a series of at least 4 lower lows. I’ll then offer some opinion on how it
    translates to our current situation.

- en: The chance of seeing a bounce is greater when you are above the 200ma than when
    you are below. Over the period tested it’s in the range of 57%-67% above and 44%-60%
    below. In either case the market is generally more likely to rise over the next
    1-10 days.

- en: The average loss is slightly larger when under the 200ma. The difference would
    be skewed quite a bit more in the favor of the “greater than 200ma” bucket if
    not for the “max loss” outlier. The unusually large loss above the 200ma came
    courtesy of the Crash of ’87\. (Which incidentally was not included in Connors
    book since those tests only ran to 1989.)

- en: The average win below the 200ma is nearly twice the size of the average win
    above the 200ma for most time periods looked at. For those wondering why this
    is, think “short-covering rally” and increased volatility. Both trademarks of
    long-term downtrends.

- en: Even with the increased chance of a bounce above the 200ma, the expected value
    (avg trade) is greater below the line. This would remain true even if you were
    to eliminate the “worst trade” from the upper bucket.

- en: This study suggests an upside edge over the next few days. Before getting too
    excited though it may be worth considering what we just learned in the context
    of the current market situation. Yes, we’ve pulled back 4 days in a row, but although
    the market is below its 200 day moving average, volatility remains relatively
    low. The chance of short-covering helping to fuel a bounce seems muted as well
    since the market has been rallying already for a month and a half. Based on these
    facts, I would reduce the expected potential reward from the “under 200 ma” level
    to the “over 200ma level”. The chance of a bounce actually materializing I might
    put somewhere in between the two buckets. There has been a series of higher lows
    and the market is in an uptrend, but it isn’t quite a healthy sustained rally
    just yet.

    days – just not one that is as large as it first might appear when glancing at
    the tables.
