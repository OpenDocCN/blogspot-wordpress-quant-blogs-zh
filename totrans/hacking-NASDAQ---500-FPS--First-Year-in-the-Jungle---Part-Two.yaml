    known have no interest in trading or only romanticize about it and others slowly
    inch towards it at a prop desk. For the few (fools) who take the plunge without
    a clue, we get bitten on the ass by the bitch that is reality.

    me, I didnt have that luxury. One of my options was to call up the clients I worked
    with and asked for a job which would have caused all sorts of weirdness/problems.
    But would also have to go thru the same process of start in technology, find a
    way into research, then strategy development, then eventually some how prove myself
    enough to trade, and only after all that would I get my own PnL - we`re talking
    years here. And if you apply conditional probability to each of these steps then
    the chances of getting to the end is quite low.

    you is the market but your completely on your own, no one to learn from or help
    you - anything but a walk in the park and what I chose, simply due to a lack of
    any other option.

    at age 27\. Have been part of at least 3 fairly famous yet grueling projects,
    been off into the woods as solo startup founder and a ton of other shit. Out of
    all of this HF trading is by far the most challenging and difficult work so far.
    Why? because you have no one to learn from, learning material is sketchy at best
    and the only real way to learn is by trial and error in the market with real money.
    If you compound trial & error with the stress of say, there`s a bug and your holding
    $250K of inventory when the market moves against you, its what either breaks you
    or further detaches you from the emotion.

    money and loosing money was extremely painful. These days it sucks but its ok
    to loose money. One of the traps traders get into is having to be right 100% of
    the time e.g. 100% profitable trades. Some trades are positive, some are negative,
    some days are positive, some days are negative and thats ok.

    my development environment since 2001 yet only this year when dealing with TerraBytes
    of data have I been forced to dig really deep into the *unix philosophy*. Prior
    to that have known, hacked and understood unix/linux technically but lacked the
    deep philosophy of its simplicity and how it all connects to make it run silky
    smooth.

    forever, calculus a little but this year finally gained deeper intuition about
    statistics. Everyone has heard of or used min, max, mean, median, arithmetic,
    geometric, standard deviation, correlation, variance, t values, p values, linear
    regression, non-linear regression, autoregressive, eigenvalues, eigenvectors random
    walks, monte carlo..... blah blah blah and so on. You can even call this function
    / library and it spits out some result without any idea how it works, yet only
    recently have the basic foundations become completely natural and not forced.

    so knew well about the need to spend money, however when its *your* money its
    certainly different. The beauty of an employer/employee relationship is the comfort
    and (perceived) stability you get of regular cheques. Now days the amount and
    sign of the cheque changes all the time, not an easy transition.

    care if you have something else to do, certainly dosent care if your bladder is
    full and most certainly does not give a shit if you have caught the flu. In previous
    jobs you can take days off, arrive late, leave early go to the bathroom any time
    and it dosent cause much disruption. For trading even automated systems you (or
    someone) needs to be there watching it, monitoring it so when (not if) it fucks
    up your around to clean up..

    if you screw up (read Knights recent meltdown), what worse is the speed systems
    must be developed and changed is frantic compared to say medical/aviation which
    are given a very long times to build/verify. Trading changes fast and things always
    go wrong, as such have built systems and an approach thats different and so far
    has worked well. In a regular development role you can do sloppy code and it really
    dosent matter, or you can always come back to it when you have more time to fill
    in the blanks.

    its still bits in a computer, statements are still bits, the money sits as bits
    at a bank, its all just bits, but feels mortal. Guess we get programmed as a child
    about money, its value how central it is thus touching this much money even virtually
    shakes us to the core. In other lives the closet ive got to this kind of buzz is
    for mischievous things.

    Seems because its real money it gets respected. In previous lines of work no one
    really understood, "shaved 1micro second off the latency today" vs "traded $XXXX
    million dollars today" the latter gets oohs and ahhs, with the former a nod and
    "thats nice".

    When I left my last job the goal was to consistently make $100/day which might
    sound ridiculous, but is orders of magnitude harder than it sounds. Thankfully
    I`m making more than $100/day but after everyone takes their cut, the ridiculously strong
    yen, financially I`m barely scraping by, Overall certainly a net loss if you amortize
    it over the year, rent bills food etc etc. and so far this is easily the lowest
    paying job ive had since turning 20yo.
