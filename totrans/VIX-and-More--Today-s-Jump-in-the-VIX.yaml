    find it particularly ironic that many of the same people who were pounding the
    table saying that the market could not bottom unless there was another dramatic
    VIX spike and high volume capitulation are now insisting that the markets cannot
    rally from current levels until the VIX continues down. I suspect these pundits
    will end up going 0 for 2 in their predictions.

    of 666.79 on March 6^(th), the VIX was at 51.65, which was not even the high for
    the particular day. By the end of the day, the VIX was down to 49.33 in what looks
    in retrospect like a classic [stealth bottom](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/stealth%20bottom).

    I opined that a simplistic conceptual model of the VIX is one which “incorporates
    incremental changes in uncertainty and [fear](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/fear)
    on top of recent historical volatility.” Many of the common measures of historical
    volatility (10, 20, 30 and 50 day) show that historical volatility in the SPX
    topped in the middle to latter portion of March. Since the 7.08% jump in the SPX
    on March 23^(rd), trading has been relatively subdued from a volatility perspective.
    As that 7.08% jump as well as the 6.37% and 4.07% jumps from March 10^(th) and
    March 12^(th) begin to scroll off the lookback window, historical volatility numbers
    should begin to lead the VIX back down.

    bank failure seems to be receding, while concerns about a deepening global recession
    are lingering and still rising in some quarters. The G-20 meeting underscored
    the willingness of leaders of the world’s largest economies to coordinate their
    activities, even if they cannot agree on the details of those coordinated efforts.

    volatility readings and changes in the macroeconomic landscape. The fear component
    of the VIX is clearly on the wane, which should mute any VIX spikes. On the other
    hand, historical volatility needs to continue to decline and the VIX term structure
    (which is based on SPX options) and VIX futures need to soften somewhat before
    the VIX can reasonably be expected to start trading in the 30s on a regular basis.

    the future of the VIX. While charts can provide some useful information and it
    is nice to know that the VIX has recently moved below its 200 day moving average,
    sometimes putting the VIX in the proper geopolitical and macroeconomic context
    is a more valuable approach.

    their move up without the VIX being required to plummet. In fact, if the bulls
    continue to keep the upper hand, expect the VIX to decline in a decidedly gradual
    fashion.

    is typical of the VIX, but not on [Mondays](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Monday),
    when ‘[calendar reversion](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/calendar%20reversion)’
    usually means the VIX jumps about 1.5%. Add to this the 1.53% that the VIX fell
    during the 4:00 – 4:15 p.m. ET index trading portion of Friday’s session and one
    could make the argument that the VIX barely moved at all today relative to the
    SPX.
