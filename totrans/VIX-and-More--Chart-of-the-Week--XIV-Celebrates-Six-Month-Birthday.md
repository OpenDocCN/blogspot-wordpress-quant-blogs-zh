# VIX and More: Chart of the Week: XIV Celebrates Six-Month Birthday

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2011/05/chart-of-week-xiv-celebrates-six-month.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2011/05/chart-of-week-xiv-celebrates-six-month.html#0001-01-01)

Yesterday marked six months since the launch of the VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term ETN ([XIV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XIV)).

While XIV’s launch was received with little fanfare, I was a *huge* fan of this ETN right from the start. Less than one week after XIV was launched, I shared my thoughts about XIV in the [Bespoke Investment Group](http://www.bespokeinvest.com/)’s [second annual roundtable](http://bespokepremium.com/roundtable/). When asked about some of my favorite picks for 2011 and beyond, I [predicted](http://bespokepremium.com/roundtable/vixandmore/):

> *“2011 will mark the rise of volatility as an asset class.  Part of the reason for this rise will be the runaway success of VIX-based ETNs and ETFs, notably the recently launched XIV, which will prove that volatility vehicles can be good buy-and-hold investments.”*

During the course of its first six months of trading, XIV has managed to return 82% to anyone who was fortunate enough to buy some of this ETN when it launched. As shown in this week’s

below, XIV's ride has been a wild one and has included a pullback of about 33% in one month during all the turmoil associated with the Japanese earthquake + tsunami + nuclear meltdown.

Looking ahead, I am going to go out on another limb and say that 82% in six months was not a fluke. Sure XIV is an extremely volatile security that will experience sharp drawdowns on a regular basis, but for the patient investor who is able to steer clear of margin issues, XIV can be an excellent way to spice up one’s portfolio with stunning long-term returns.

That being said, just as shorting

[VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX)

is a strategy suited to only a small slice of the investment community, so is XIV not appropriate for everyone, in spite of the upside potential. For those who think they may be up to the task, I highly recommend a comprehensive risk management plan and a review of

, as well as some of the other links below.
