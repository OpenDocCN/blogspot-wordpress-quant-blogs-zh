    "Building an “All-Weather” Sector Portfolio") which was developed using data from
    Fidelity Asset Allocation Research. I created a heuristic approach to integrate
    a variety of factors (length of  stage, sector performance ranking by stage) in
    order to create the final portfolio allocation. It is obviously very interesting
    to examine the performance of this static/strategic portfolio allocation over
    time. For testing comparisons, I used the [Fidelity Sector mutual funds](https://www.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/sector-funds/overview)
    total return series and also the S&P500 total return cash index. The time period
    for testing was chosen to include all active [](https://cssanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/all-weather-sector-perf-table.png)
    sector members to ensure a fair comparison.  Three time series were created: 1)
    “All-Weather” Sector 2) Equal Weight Sector 3) S&P500 Total Return Index. Rebalancing
    was conducted on a monthly basis.The graph and table below depict the results:'

- en: The results are promising– both higher returns and risk-adjusted returns than
    both an equal weight benchmark and the S&P500\.  The All-Weather Sector also has
    the lowest risk of the three portfolios. Transaction costs and turnover are likely
    to be negligible in this case–especially if one were to stay within the minimum
    holding period for the funds. The broad diversification across sectors and limited
    “tilting” of sector weights makes this version of the All-Weather Sector Portfolio
    a desirable core equity holding for investors. The All-Weather Sector Portfolio
    is arguably a superior theoretical index construction than equal or market cap
    weightings, with  low tracking error,  tax-efficiency,  and good results to back
    up the concept.  In subsequent posts I will show some alternative formulations
    and weighting schemes that have superior performance.
