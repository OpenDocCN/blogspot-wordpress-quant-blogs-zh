I flew up to Bennington, Vermont yesterday. The fall foliage is absolutely magnificent. There is no place in the United States like Vermont.

It's about a 1-1/4 hour flight from Morristown (MMU) Airport to Stephen Morse Airport in Bennington. Fly over the Catskills to Albany, then make a right turn at the 083 radial of the Albany VOR. It's about another 10 minutes.
