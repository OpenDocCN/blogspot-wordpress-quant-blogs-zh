# Magmasystems Blog: Windows Workflow and Auto-Execution?

> 来源：[http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2007/03/windows-workflow-and-auto-execution.html#0001-01-01](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2007/03/windows-workflow-and-auto-execution.html#0001-01-01)

In preparation for Joe's lecture next week on Windows Workflow Foundation (WF), I am reading a book by Kenn Scribner that just came out on Microsoft Press.

WF has a rule-based workflow engine. I am wondering how application this would be for auto-execution engines.

Also, the middle-office guys have asked me if WF can be used to replace

[Fuego](http://www.fuego.com/)

. I don't know anything about Fuego, but hopefully, Joe can answer this.

I am most excited to see how I can integrate WF with the .NET client framework that my team is writing. I know that Merrill Lynch is doing a lot of things with WF, so it looks like there are some good use cases in the capital markets sector. OMS's? EMS's?
