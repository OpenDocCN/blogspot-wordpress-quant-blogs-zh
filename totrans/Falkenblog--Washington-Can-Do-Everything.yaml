    in a vehicle getting 18 miles per gallon or less for one getting at least 22 miles
    per gallon. The value of the voucher would grow to $4,500 if the mileage of the
    new car is 10 mpg higher than the old vehicle. The miles per gallon figures are
    listed on the window sticker.

- en: Rep. Betty Sutton, D-Ohio, the bill's chief sponsor, said the bill showed that
    "the multiple goals of helping consumers purchase more fuel efficient vehicles,
    improving our environment and boosting auto sales can be achieved." Sen. Debbie
    Stabenow, D-Mich., has backed a similar version in the Senate, which has the support
    of automakers and their unions.

- en: The bill would direct dealers to ensure that the older vehicles are crushed
    or shredded to get the clunkers off the road. It was intended to help replace
    older vehicles — built in model year 1984 or later — and would not make financial
    sense for consumers owning an older car with a trade-in value greater than $3,500
    or $4,500

    obliged to do everything: help consumers, companies, save the environment, all
    in one swoop. But one must remember that money from the government does not come
    from a cookie jar, it comes from us, so we are really deciding, top down, to subsidize
    the demand curve for autos, the supply curve of low-end cars, sure that creating
    a new car is better for the environment than using an existing one.'
