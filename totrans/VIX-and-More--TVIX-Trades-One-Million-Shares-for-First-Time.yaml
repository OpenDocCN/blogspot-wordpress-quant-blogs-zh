- en: Launched at the end of November 2010, the VelocityShares Daily 2x VIX Short-Term
    ETN ([TVIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TVIX)) has been the most
    popular of the volatility-based ETPs to hit the market in the past six months.
    Today TVIX hit a new milestone – barely halfway into the trading session – by
    surpassing one million shares for the first time.

    TVIX “will hit a tipping point and become the darling of day traders” in 2011\.
    Frankly, I am a little surprised that it has taken more than five months to hit
    the one million share mark, but now that TVIX is adding liquidity, I would expect
    that day traders, hedge funds and other short-term trading operations will become
    much more active in this product.
