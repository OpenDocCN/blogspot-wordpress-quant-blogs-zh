    measure to top ahead of price during intermediate-term market cycles. The measure
    has remained strong recently. ***Interestingly, going back to 2012, when the multiperiod
    measure has been positive (more stocks making new highs than lows), the next five
    days in SPX have averaged a gain of +.15%. When the measure has been negative,
    the next five days in SPX have averaged a gain of +.71%. Yet another example of
    how momentum trading (buying strength and selling weakness) has not worked for
    stock index traders in recent years.***

    they have not pulled back enough to register extreme oversold readings that indicate
    a durable short-term bottom. As the chart below shows, the 5-day RSI, 14-day RSI
    are nearing oversold readings but there is room for them to fall a bit further.
    As well, the SPX has fallen to the lower Bollinger Band before reversing itself
