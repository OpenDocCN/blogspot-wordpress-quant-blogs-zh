## Datomic – Trade Lifecycle

Craig’s Real-World [Datomic](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/datomic-use-case): An Experience Report presentation reminds me that I need to find time to play with Datomic.  There’s a few Java examples available [here](http://docs.datomic.com/examples.html).  Of particular interesting is the time [travel](http://www.slideshare.net/datablend/datomicflux-graph) 🙂 that would be interesting from a bi-temporal trade life-cycle perspective.
