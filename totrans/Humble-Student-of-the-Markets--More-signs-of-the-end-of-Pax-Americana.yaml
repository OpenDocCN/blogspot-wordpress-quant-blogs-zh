    months—the man said that he had started his career protecting government networks
    against foreign attacks. On that job, he became so preoccupied with the scale
    of Chinese hacking that ***a senior military officer told him to stop talking
    about it, with the gruff explanation that “the reason this is still going on is
    that the Chinese government now owns us.”***

    of more than 40 per cent of Canada’s population. On the other side, some employers
    – particularly in Alberta’s oil sector – say they can’t find enough skilled workers,
    prompting the country’s federal immigration minister to publicly muse last month
    on how to admit more skilled Americans.

    Canada to the United States in 1994, the top combined marginal income tax rate
    in Canada was about 53-55%, depending on provincial jurisdiction. When I returned
    in 2007, the top rate was in the low to mid-40s. While headline healthcare costs
    are minimal in Canada, residents still bear the costs of drugs so the overall
    costs between Canadian and American healthcare aren't hugely different for someone

    the long-term path for commodity prices is still up, albeit in a volatile fashion.
    The major industrialized countries of the world will undergo a path of competitive
    devaluation and those pressures will show up mainly in commodity and asset price
    inflation.

    friendly investment environment for commodity prices. Continued government and/or
    central bank accommodative policy responses will likely push real interest rates
    even lower and add to even more future asset inflation. Indeed, the latest FOMC
    minutes are hinting that the Fed will not hesitate to undertake QE3 should the
    economy weaken further.   Investors who are opportunistic or prepared to look
    over the valley can view periods of market weakness as opportunities to accumulate
    positions in commodities or commodity producers as a hedge against asset price
    inflation.       *Cam Hui is a portfolio manager at [Qwest Investment Fund Management
