- en: The topic of inequality has been a hot topic lately, I have been writing off
    and on about its effects for some time. There is no question that inequality has
    been growing for the last few decades in the United States. The debate is over
    whether the economic and social policies surrounding this change. Here is an informative
    if somewhat wonkish chart from

    the growth rate of the economy, it is all but inevitable that inheritance (of
    fortunes accumulated in the past) predominates over saving (wealth accumulated
    in the present).... Wealth originating in the past automatically grows more rapidly,
    even without labour, than wealth stemming from work, which can be saved.

    are durably higher than the returns to labor and they are "durably higher" than
    the economy's growth rate. It's no wonder inequality has grown.

    of households owns about 35 percent of American wealth, more than the entire bottom
    90 percent does. But at least at the moment, growing inequality has not resulted
    in a big boom in inheritances. Since the 1980s, the value of inherited wealth
    has only drifted upward slightly. In fact, wealth transfers as a proportion of
    net worth have fallen, to 19 percent in 2007 from 29 percent in 1989.

    some potentially worrisome consequences for social mobility in the United States,
    as the immense earnings of an already stratified economy are entrusted to a new
    generation. The inheritance boom will come, eventually. What’s unclear is what
    the country will look like afterward.

- en: This expected transfer of wealth presents a challenge for people who are in
    the wealth management business. Much of the discussion in the current low interest
    rate environment revolves around the right withdrawal rate from savings for retirees.
    For the super-wealthy, the withdrawal rate question is not relevant - and therefore
    financial planners and wealth managers need to deal with a paradigm shift in their
    business.

- en: The current underlying model for retirement planning goes something like this.
    When you are young, you save for retirement, aided by tax-deferred vehicles like
    401ks, IRAs, etc. When you cannot work anymore and retire, you draw down on those
    savings to fund your living expenses. Upon death, those savings are exhausted
    or nearly exhausted and the residual goes to the heirs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While that model of retirement remains relevant for the mass affluent market,
    it's less relevant for the super-wealthy. This demographic will not need to draw
    down their savings to retire. The income generated by their wealth far outstrips
    their spending needs. After all, if you have $100 million, does it matter that
    much if your withdrawal rate is 2% or 4%? How much could you possibly spend? For
    this group, their savings will outlive them and the financial planning framework
    shifts from "will I outlive my savings" to "how do I maintain my wealth for my
    heirs after I die" . In other words, how do I sustain my dynasty?

    trends. America has been getting more unequal and the wealth distribution is getting
    more skewed. If you get caught with a business model that caters the to common

    the size of your market is stagnant or shrinking. The growth market is serving

    planning challenge shifts from attracting 401k and IRA savings to sustaining wealth
    for generations in a tax efficient fashion. Do you have the legal and tax planning
    resources to do that? Do you have the resources to diversify into other asset
    classes, such real estate development and management, for clients with such long
    time horizons? No longer are you dealing with the plain vanilla bonds and equity
    asset classes for the mass affluent market.
