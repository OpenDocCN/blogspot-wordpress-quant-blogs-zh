- en: When the market puts in a bar like SPY did on Tuesday I always hear people suggest
    that the weak finish indicates the bulls are losing control and a pullback is
    likely to follow. These claims sound reasonable but are generally way off base.
    To demonstrate I ran a test of performance following unfilled upside gaps that
    make a 20-day high. Below I’ve broken out the results by times the SPY closed
    above the open versus times it closed below the open.

    times like the present where SPY closed below the open. Other than that – all
    the rules are the same.

    the open. Rather than worrying about the weak finishes like Tuesday, bulls should
    be excited by it.

    and that my overall bias for the next few days is not bullish.
