# Humble Student of the Markets: Is a recession just around the corner?

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2016/09/is-recession-just-around-corner.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2016/09/is-recession-just-around-corner.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models**

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post, 

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The

**Trend Model**

is an asset allocation model which applies trend following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or contraction (bearish)?"

My inner trader uses the

**trading component**

of the Trend Model to look for changes in direction of the main Trend Model signal. A bullish Trend Model signal that gets less bullish is a trading "sell" signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading "buy" signal. The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. Past trading of the trading model has shown turnover rates of about 200% per month.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Buy equities*
*   Trend Model signal: Risk-on*
*   Trading model: Bullish*

*The performance chart and model readings have been delayed by a week out of respect to our paying subscribers.* **Update schedule**

: I generally update model readings on my

on weekends and tweet any changes during the week at @humblestudent. Subscribers will also receive email notices of any changes in my trading portfolio.

**My answer to Northy**

Recently, a lot of US macro economic releases has been coming in a bit on the soft side. As the chart below shows, stock prices have a high degree of correlation with the Citigroup Economic Surprise Index, which measures whether economic data is beating or missing expectations.

As a result, I am sensing a heightened level of anxiety among some of my readers. I have received several requests for comments to the macro post written by Sven Henrich, otherwise known as Northman Trader (Northy). In his post, 

[Time to get real, Part II](https://northmantrader.com/2016/09/10/time-to-get-real-part-ii/)

, Northy laid out the macro view for an impending recession. He correctly pointed out that recessions, which are bull market killers, often occur during the first year of a presidential term. So, with macro data weakening, is a recession just around the corner?

In conjunction to my response to Northy's recessionary post, I thought that it would also be timely to review the message from my

[Recession Watch](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/long-leading-indicators/)

indicators.
