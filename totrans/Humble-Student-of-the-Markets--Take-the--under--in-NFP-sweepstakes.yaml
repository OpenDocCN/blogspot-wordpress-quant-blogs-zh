    fashion to what is essentially noise. The error term in the NFP release is so
    enormous that it's meaningless. Nevertheless, we have to deal with this source
    of volatility.

    weakening. How much of that is Sandy related, I have no idea.

- en: Gallup's unemployment results for the 30 days ending on Nov. 15 suggest that
    the improvement in the U.S. unemployment situation found in October was short-lived.
    Still, on an unadjusted basis, Gallup's unemployment and underemployment measures
    over the past two months show what might be expected holiday seasonal improvement.
    U.S. companies increase hiring for the Christmas holidays at this time of year.

    to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and may be doing the same to Gallup's
    unemployment results. The presidential election may also have disrupted the job
    market for a few days in early November.

- en: Taking seasonal factors into account, it appears that the unemployment rate
    has remained around 8.0% since May. This seems consistent with other general economic
    data showing the economy growing slowly, the most recent of these being the 0.3%
    decline in October retail sales.

    predictive insight into the official BLS numbers. In turn, Gallup's results suggest
    that in early December, the BLS could report an unchanged seasonally adjusted
    unemployment rate for November.

    drop from the 171K release in October. Given the inherent volatility of NFP day
    and the uncertainty caused by Sandy, I would stand aside. If you don't have an
    edge, don't bet.
