    to the blog today, it appears that a sub-20 VIX that is more than 10% below the
    VIX’s 10 day simple moving average has a lot of people wondering about overbought
    signals.

    [Trading Markets 5% rule](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/07/tradingmarkets-5-vix-rule.html),
    etc.) which utilize the VIX to signal overbought and oversold conditions and I
    can summarize my thinking briefly here:'

    range) instead of absolute values

    it is acceptable to add to losing positions (assuming the mean reversion signal
    is still valid)

    10% below the 10 day SMA?  Generally tradeable.  A better signal?  While it is
    still too early ‘cling tightly’ to the [VXV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXV)
    (an index that calculates the 93 day implied volatility for the SPX options),
    I am bullish on the [VIX:VXV ratio](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%3AVXV)
    – and the chart of that ratio suggests that the market is approaching an overbought
    condition.
