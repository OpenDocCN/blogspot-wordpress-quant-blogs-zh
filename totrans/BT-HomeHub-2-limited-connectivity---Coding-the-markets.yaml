- en: Going off topic here, as this isn’t etrading related, but I’ll blog it as I
    suspect others might be having problems with Windows 7 and 8 PCs dropping connections
    to BT HomHub 2 modem routers. If you’re connection only lasts for a few minutes,
    and then shows as “limited connectivity” it could be because recent Windows does
    DHCP differently than Homehub. I found an MS KB article that suggests adding a
    registry flag in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SYSTEM/CurrentControlSet/Services/Tcpip/Parameters/Interfaces/{GUID}.
    The flag is called DhcpConnEnableBcastFlagToggle, it should be a DWORD, and be
    set to 1\. There may be several GUIDs under Interfaces, depending on how many
    Wifi hubs your PC talks to. Look inside each and examine IP addresses to figure
    out which is the Homehub.
