    of the negative scenarios raised by the pundit was catastrophic success. What
    if the Coalition troops became too successful, Iraqi resistance all but collapses
    and the Coalition spearhead advances so fast that it outruns its supply lines?

    to the upside. In other words, he thinks it's more likely that the the U.S. economy

    risks," wrote LaVorgna in a note to clients on Tuesday. "However, for us, the
    risk to growth is to the upside, not the downside. Beyond this, the primary downside
    risk in 2014, as it is in most years, is geopolitical, meaning we get some sort
    of negative exogenous shock such as an oil price spike."'

    on the Fed to normalize interest rates relatively quickly. Already, the yield
    curve has started to steepen in reaction to the news of tapering of QE purchases.
    If growth were to approach 4%, then the bond market would react first with further
    steepening of the yield curve and stock prices could react either by rallying
    on higher earnings expectations or fall because of rising interest rates. Regardless
    of market direction, sector leadership would change to cyclical and late cycle
    deep cyclical inflation-sensitive groups.
