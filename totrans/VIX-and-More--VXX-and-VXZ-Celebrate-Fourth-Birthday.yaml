    That’s what [VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX) must have been
    thinking today as it gained 6.2%, while it’s often overlooked sibling, [VXZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXZ),
    gained 2.2%.

    products](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20ETN) in the aggregate,
    but for selected periods, they have been remarkable performers. Just ask anyone
    who was short VXX when it spiked 198% during a period from July to October of
    2011.

- en: In spite of that impressive short-term performance, both VXX and VXZ have lost
    ground in each of the four years since their launch. To be fair, though, so did
    the VIX, if one measures each ‘performance year’ from January 30^(th).

- en: The table below shows the performance of VXX, VXZ, the VIX and SPY during each
    of those January 30^(th) performance years. When one considers that in each of
    those yearly measurement periods the SPY advanced and the VIX declined, it is
    a little bit easier to swallow the performance of the two pioneering VIX ETPs.

    VXZ in this space as early as the first half of 2009, VXX is still the #1 VIX
    ETP in terms of assets at $1.043 billion, while VXZ is in the #8 slot at $57 million.'

- en: To reiterate what I have maintained since their launch, VXX and VXZ are products
    that are suitable for short-term long volatility positions or for longer-term
    holding periods under certain market conditions. For those who are interested
    in more information, the links below should provide some excellent jumping off
    points.

    and more generally of all VIX and volatility-based exchange-traded products. 
    I also strongly encourage potential investors in this space to spend some time
    learning the intricacies of [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures),
    [contango](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/contango), [roll yield](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/roll%20yield)
    and other related subjects.
