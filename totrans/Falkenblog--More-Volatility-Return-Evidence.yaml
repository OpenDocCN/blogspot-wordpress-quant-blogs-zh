    who then invests with his perverse benchmark concerns. There is a lot of anecdotes
    and data to suggest that institutional portfolio managers are evaluated based
    on their benchmark volatility, regardless of what investors truly believe, so
    this isn't a very radical assumption.

    should be zero (because everything else is 'in' the models). Using t-stats and

- en: introduced a volatility factor (VMS--Volatile Minus Stable), that like the momentum
    factor, is just a long-short portfolio that reflects the 'risk premium' to the
    'volatility factor', though here this risk premium is negative so this is like
    an insurance premium. Adding this VMS factor to the Fama-French 3-factor model
    does worse than Blitz's agency-based model. Its a good think if we can quit adding
    anomalies to our 'risk factors' as a way of explaining them, and this research
    supports that effort.

    why equities are riskier than bonds but does not explain returns within equities,
    this implies everyone holding higher-than-average beta stocks is either deluded
    or not in an equilibrium. The solution seemed like a duct-tape patch to a major
    problem, but somehow leads to no consternation at the inconsistency. Common sense
    is having a feel for which inconsistencies are fatal and which are noise, and
    my Spider-sense has always told me this is a bad inconsistency.

  zh: 我一直的问题是：如果标准模型是正确的，那么贝塔解释为什么股票比债券风险更高，却不能解释股票内部的回报，这意味着持有高于平均贝塔的股票的人们要么被蒙骗，要么不在均衡状态下。解决方案似乎像是对重大问题的一个要点修补，但却不会引起不一致性上的不安。常识是懂得哪些不一致性是致命的，哪些是噪音，而我的蜘蛛感一直告诉我这是一个严重的不一致性。

    but rise pretty consistently when you looked over a 24-month holding period. I
    don't see how they got this, but suspect it has something to do with their inclusion
    requirements, such as including only stocks that existed over the subsequent 24
    months. Further, they had no size exclusions, so they probably used every little
    penny stock that generates outsized returns but was non-tradable as a practical
    matter. I'm just guessing, because I don't see how they got such a large volatility
    premium (they used several to the same effect).

  zh: 一份研究表明，如果你看一个月的持有期，回报会下降，但如果你在24个月的持有期内观察，回报会相当持续地上升。 我不明白他们是怎么做到的，但怀疑这与他们的纳入要求有关，例如只包括在随后24个月内存在的股票。
    此外，他们没有规模排除，因此他们可能使用了每一笔小资产股票，这些股票产生了超额回报，但从实际上来看是不可交易的。 我只是在猜测，因为我不明白他们是如何得到这样一个大的波动溢价（它们使用了几种相同的效果）。
