    who then invests with his perverse benchmark concerns. There is a lot of anecdotes
    and data to suggest that institutional portfolio managers are evaluated based
    on their benchmark volatility, regardless of what investors truly believe, so
    this isn't a very radical assumption.

    that are traditionally used for testing theory modifications, he uses monthly
    data generates mean 'alphas' for these portfolios, which are intercepts that theoretically
    should be zero (because everything else is 'in' the models). Using t-stats and
    joint F-tests one can assess which approach fits the data better, and the agency
    based model works better (as usual, there are several other tests).

    factor, is just a long-short portfolio that reflects the 'risk premium' to the
    'volatility factor', though here this risk premium is negative so this is like
    an insurance premium. Adding this VMS factor to the Fama-French 3-factor model
    does worse than Blitz's agency-based model. Its a good think if we can quit adding
    anomalies to our 'risk factors' as a way of explaining them, and this research
    supports that effort.

    why equities are riskier than bonds but does not explain returns within equities,
    this implies everyone holding higher-than-average beta stocks is either deluded
    or not in an equilibrium. The solution seemed like a duct-tape patch to a major
    problem, but somehow leads to no consternation at the inconsistency. Common sense
    is having a feel for which inconsistencies are fatal and which are noise, and
    my Spider-sense has always told me this is a bad inconsistency.

    but rise pretty consistently when you looked over a 24-month holding period. I
    don't see how they got this, but suspect it has something to do with their inclusion
    requirements, such as including only stocks that existed over the subsequent 24
    months. Further, they had no size exclusions, so they probably used every little
    penny stock that generates outsized returns but was non-tradable as a practical
    matter. I'm just guessing, because I don't see how they got such a large volatility
    premium (they used several to the same effect).
