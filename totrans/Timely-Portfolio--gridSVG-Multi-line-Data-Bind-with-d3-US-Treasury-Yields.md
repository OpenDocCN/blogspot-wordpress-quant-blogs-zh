*If you have not read the other [posts on gridSVG and d3](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/search/label/gridSVG), I recommend reading those before progressing to this one.*

Facets or strips are one of my favorite features of lattice and ggplot2, so of course I want to extend our d3 reverse data bind to support these small multiples.  Let’s see one way of accomplishing this.  For a short explanation of the process, click [here](http://timelyportfolio.github.io/gridSVG_d3_multline/d3mult_line.html) or on the screenshot below.  If you just like yield curve data, I think you will enjoy the graph which I have embedded below.
