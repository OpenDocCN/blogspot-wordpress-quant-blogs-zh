    crisis is over, the logical conclusion is that we are seeing the birth of a new
    secular bull. Indeed, I examined the kurtosis of stock returns and found that
    it is falling.

    lighter, it decreases. A normal distribution has a kurtosis of 0, and is called
    mesokurtic (A below). If a distribution is peaked (tall and skinny), its kurtosis
    value is greater than 0 and it is said to be leptokurtic (No ointments needed.)

    There are three ways to deleverage. We hear a lot about austerity. In other words,
    pull in your belt, spend less, and reduce debt. But austerity causes less spending
    and, because when you spend less, somebody earns less, it causes the contraction
    to feed on itself. Austerity causes more problems. It is deflationary and it is
    negative for growth.'

    time frame or at a lower interest rate; somehow a contract is broken in a way
    that reduces debt. But debt restructurings also are deflationary and negative
    for growth. One man's debts are another man's assets, and when debts are written
    down to relieve the debtor of the burden, it has a negative effect on wealth.
    That causes credit to decline.

    you can't lower interest rates any more. Central banks create money, essentially,
    and buy the assets that put money in the system for a quantitative easing or debt
    monetization. Unlike the first two options, this is an inflationary action and
    stimulative to the economy.

    very classic. Governments have to spend more when sales and tax revenue go down
    and as unemployment and other social benefits kick in and there is a redistribution
    of wealth. That's why there is going to be more taxation on the wealthy and more
    social tension. A deleveraging is not an easy time. But when you are approaching
    balance again, that's a good thing.
