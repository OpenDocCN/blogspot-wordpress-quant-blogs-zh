    was a quiet day with little out of the ordinary. In fact, the higher closes in
    the S&P 500 and Dow masked some substantial selling that took place. Breadth was
    strongly negative on the NYSE, both in terms of advancers vs. decliners and in
    terms of up volume vs. down volume.

    of the total of the two. I looked back to 1970 to see other times when up volume
    was less than 35% of up plus down volume while the S&P 500 closed positive on
    the day. I was fairly surprised to find only 4 other cases. They were 3/27/80,
    1/25/82, 10/4/94, and 3/23/05.

    some. In this case I changed the requirement from 35% up volume to 45% or lower
    up volume. Below is a summary of the results.

    S&P over the subsequent two weeks. Whatever was holding the S&P 500 up in the
    face of the instance-day weakness eventually ends up falling as well.
