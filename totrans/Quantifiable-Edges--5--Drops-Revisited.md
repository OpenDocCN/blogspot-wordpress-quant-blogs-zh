# Quantifiable Edges: 5% Drops Revisited

> 来源：[http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2008/12/5-drops-revisited.html#0001-01-01](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2008/12/5-drops-revisited.html#0001-01-01)

[About a month ago I showed](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2008/11/5-drops-often-followed-by-rebounds.html)

how the S&P 500 has performed following days where the market dropped 5% or more. In most cases such a strong reaction was an overreaction and the market closed above the close of the 5% drop day shortly thereafter.

Since I showed that table a month ago we have had SIX more 5% drops. Five of the six saw the same pattern with some kind of bounce in the next few days. Below I’ve updated the table which lists all 5% drop days and whether they closed above the 5% drop day close in the next week.
