- en: 'We’re in the process of moving our 600KLOC codebase from VC6 to VC8, so I moved
    my current development project to VC8\. After the usual snafus getting a working
    build I finally have a binary that I can build, run & debug in the IDE and at
    the command line. Getting a binary that links is always a struggle in a new environment,
    especially if the ground is moving under your feet with new versions of STLport,
    Boost and others. So I was relieved when the link finally came up with zero unresolved
    externals, and I could start to explore the most important part on an IDE: the
    debugger. It’s nice. The tabbed debug windows for browsing variables, threads,
    callstack work nicely. And you can click on a variable and pop up a view – very
    handy for those long strings that got truncated in the old VC6 debugger window.'
