    3-factor model include a value and size proxies (ie, long high book-market/low
    cap, short low book-market/high cap) as well as the market (as in the traditional
    Capital Asset Pricing Model). The market factor does not work within equities,
    but 'explains' the relative premium in equity indices over bonds; the size and
    value factors explain, well, themselves (the size and value anomaly). That is,
    all factors are chosen to explain themselves! While the market factor has some
    theoretical justification, value and size proxy some factor we still, after about
    30 years, haven't identified. That this is considered a logical, rigorous, theory
    highlights to me that smart people are willing to accept a lot of rationalization
    to keep their paradigm alive.

    if you sort by residual volatility, among the high cap/value stocks, there's an
    insignificant difference between the low and high volatility stocks.

    really total volatility that is the key, and so using residual volatility handicaps
    the results. Note that there's no beta premium, and so from a return perspective
    this doesn't hurt, and lower systematic volatility (ie, beta) is also a good thing
    for a portfolio.

    generate the same return for one-third the beta, or total volatility, then anyone
    who believes in mean-variance optimization (as the Dimensional Star Chamber does)
    should love low volatility investing much more than value or small cap investing.

    spreads, does not mean they aren't good data points. It's true that you can't
    really arbitrage the poor returns on high volatility stocks because they are often
    illiquid, but note that lots of people own these stocks, and they seem strictly
    dominated in the sense of Rothschild and Stiglitz  (

    would own these as they do. Further, given their high transaction costs, the holding
    period should be long, and what really kills these stocks is the compounding,
    as their volatility is about 40%, which generates an 8% drag on geometric returns
    (Geometric Return=arithmetic Return-variance/2). That people buy these lottery
    tickets is impossible to reconcile with the model where people are maximizing
    a standard utility function.
