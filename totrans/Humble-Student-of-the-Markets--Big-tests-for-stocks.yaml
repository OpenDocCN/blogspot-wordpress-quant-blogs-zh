    of buzz in the blogosphere about how investor sentiment had gotten overly bullish,

    17 have surpassed their estimates, only six have missed). But of the 11 that have
    provided guidance, nine have have taken it down and just two have taken it up,

    tax cuts. **While workers intended to spend 10 to 18 percent of their tax-cut
    income, they reported actually spending 28 to 43 percent of the funds.** This
    is higher than estimates from studies of recent tax cuts, and arguably a consequence
    of the design of the 2011 tax cuts. The shift to greater consumption than intended
    is largely unexplained by present-bias or unanticipated shocks, and is likely
    a consequence of mental accounting.
