## Incident Management

Great talk on InfoQ from [Netflix](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/netflix-incident-management) discussing a framework to handle incidents.

*   Don’t use Post Mortem’s as nobody has died
*   Incidents are complex, expensive, and generate unplanned work (tech and org)
*   [Guardrails](https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/asset_files/Presentation/2014_017_101_90577.pdf) over control/restrictions e.g. its the busiest time of the data to do a code push, are you sure?
*   Incident Management Goals – 22 mins into the video
*   Gamification of Incident Management – 24mins
*   Framework used by Netflix Core Site Reliability Engineers Team
    *   Engagement
    *   Communication
    *   Coordination
    *   Memorialisation
*   Before incidents
    *   Education – “Failing well” course, change rates, velocity of innovation
    *   Best Practices
    *   Drilling
*   Reprioritisation of work post an incident to avoid further incidents
*   Stop saying “Human Error”
*   Degraded is Normal
*   Constant Failure
*   Any change is a gamble
*   Measuring Success
    *   Short & Less Impact
    *   More Incidents
    *   Better Team Engagement
