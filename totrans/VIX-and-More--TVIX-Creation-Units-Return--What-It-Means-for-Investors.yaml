  zh: 在一个转折中，新闻稿还提到：
- en: “Beginning March 23, 2012, Credit Suisse may from time to time issue the ETNs
    into inventory of its affiliates to make the ETNs available for lending at or
    about rates that prevailed prior to the temporary suspension of issuances of the
    ETNs. Also, beginning as soon as March 28, 2012, Credit Suisse may issue additional
    ETNs from time to time to be sold solely to authorized market makers. *Credit
    Suisse may condition its acceptance of a market maker’s offer to purchase the
    ETNs on its agreeing to sell to Credit Suisse specified hedging instruments consistent
    with Credit Suisse’s hedging strategy, including but not limited to swaps.* Any
    such hedging instruments will be executed on the basis of the indicative value
    of the ETNs at that time, will not reflect any premium or discount in the trading
    price of the ETNs over their indicative value and will be *on terms acceptable
    to Credit Suisse, including the counterparty meeting Credit Suisse’s creditworthiness
    requirements, margin requirements, minimum size and duration requirements* and
    such other terms as Credit Suisse deems appropriate in its sole discretion.” [emphasis
    added]

  zh: “从2012年3月23日开始，瑞士信贷银行可能不时将其ETNs发行到其关联公司的库存中，以使ETNs以临时暂停发行前的大致利率可供出借。另外，从2012年3月28日起，瑞士信贷银行可能不时发行额外ETNs，仅供授权市场制造商购买。*瑞士信贷银行可能以其同意出售给瑞士信贷银行符合其套保策略的特定套保工具作为接受市场制造商购买ETNs的条件，包括但不限于掉期。*
    任何此类套保工具都将基于当时ETNs的暗示价值执行，不会反映ETNs交易价格相对于其暗示价值的溢价或折价，并且将*符合瑞士信贷银行可接受的条款，包括交易对手满足瑞士信贷银行的信用状况要求、保证金要求、最低规模和期限要求*以及其他瑞士信贷银行认为适当的条款。”[强调添加]

    strategy, swaps, counterparty creditworthiness, margin requirements, etc. may
    shine a light on some of the issues that Credit Suisse encountered when they elected
    to close the creation unit window last month.

- en: Today’s price action has already raised some eyebrows, with TVIX falling 29.3%
    during the regular trading session and dropping another 11.8% after hours, while
    a near equivalent security, the ProShares Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures ETF, [UVXY](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/UVXY),
    rose 2.1% during the standard session and was essentially unchanged after hours.
    As best as I can determine, news of the reopening of the creation units window
    broke at about 7:34 p.m. ET, at which point TVIX was already down more than 33%
    from Wednesday’s close. Given that the 30 million shares traded today was about
    as many shares as had exchanged hands in the prior week, it is reasonable to conclude
    that at least one party believed that new creation units were imminent and had
    hoped to profit by shorting TVIX ahead of the announcement. In fact the price
    action of TVIX was so disconnected from UVXY and the rest of the VIX ETPs that
    I fielded dozens of questions on the subject and concluded ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/VIXandMore),
    [blog comments](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2012/03/imos-saga-cramer-and-options.html#disqus_thread)),
    “The continued decline in TVIX has me wondering if someone is speculating about
    CS re-opening the creation units window.”

  zh: 今天的价格行动已经引起了一些人的注意，TVIX在正常交易时段下跌了29.3%，盘后交易又下跌了11.8%，而一个几乎等值的证券，ProShares Ultra
    VIX Short-Term Futures ETF，[UVXY](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/UVXY)，在标准交易时段上涨了2.1%，盘后交易基本持平。据我所能确定，关于创建单位窗口重新开放的新闻在大约7:34
    p.m. ET时传出，此时TVIX已经从周三的收盘价下跌了超过33%。考虑到今天成交的3000万股大约和前一周成交的股票一样多，可以合理地得出结论，至少有一方相信新的创建单位即将推出，并希望通过在TVIX宣布前做空来获利。实际上，TVIX的价格行动与UVXY和其他VIX
    ETP如此脱节，以至于我收到了数十个相关问题，并得出结论（[Twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/VIXandMore)，[博客评论](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2012/03/imos-saga-cramer-and-options.html#disqus_thread)），“TVIX的持续下跌让我怀疑是否有人在猜测瑞士信贷是否会重新开放创建单位窗口。”

- en: As for tomorrow’s open, first keep in mind that TVIX ended today’s after-hours
    session at 9.00, while indicative value is still a good deal lower at 7.83\. While
    Credit Suisse would no doubt like to see TVIX trade back at indicative value levels
    as soon as possible, the “on a limited basis” phrasing is likely to give some
    investors pause. Also, there are no guarantees that Credit Suisse might not feel
    compelled to suspend creation units again at some point in the future. For this
    reason, I would not at all be surprised to see TVIX continue to trade with a premium
    in the neighborhood of 5-10% or so at times tomorrow, dropping down to something
    along the lines of 2-5% next week. These numbers are pure speculation at this
    stage. A large part of the premium story will depend upon how limited the new
    creation units are and how aggressively Credit Suisse seeks to drive down the
    market price to the indicative value. No matter how this plays out, investors
    should expect that at least 90% of the divergence between TVIX and UVXY over the
    last month (see graphic below) will disappear tomorrow.

  zh: 至于明天的开盘，首先记住TVIX今天盘后交易结束时收于9.00，而暗示价值仍然低得多，为7.83。虽然瑞士信贷无疑希望TVIX能尽快回到暗示价值水平交易，但“有限制地”这一表述可能会让一些投资者犹豫。此外，不能保证瑞士信贷在未来某个时点不会再次感到有必要暂停创建单位。因此，我一点也不惊讶明天TVIX在某些时候会继续以5-10%左右的溢价交易，下周可能会降至大约2-5%。这些数字目前还只是纯粹的猜测。大部分溢价的故事将取决于新创建的单位有多么有限，以及瑞士信贷如何积极地推动市场价格降至暗示价值。无论事情如何发展，投资者应该预计，TVIX和UVXY之间在过去一个月出现的至少90%的分歧（见下面的图表）明天将会消失。
- en: On a related note, investors who have become wary of TVIX during the past month
    have embraced UVXY to the extent that UVXY’s daily dollar volume has been running
    ahead of that of TVIX during the past week.  As of Monday, UVXY also has the benefit
    of being supported by options, with April strikes from 14 through 35 already seeing
    a fair amount of action. With the advents of options on UVXY (and also on the
    -1x inverse VIX futures ETF, [SVXY](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SVXY))
    a new universe of trading opportunities becomes available for those who wish to
    speculate or hedge with VIX-based ETPs. What is most encouraging is that investors
    can now easily trade VIX products with defined (limited) risk positions by utilizing
    options. More on this at a later juncture.

  zh: 顺便说一下，在过去一个月里对TVIX变得谨慎的投资者已经接受了UVXY，以至于UVXY的日交易额在过去一周已经超过了TVIX。截至周一，UVXY还得到了期权的支撑，四月到35美元的期权已经看到了一定的交易活动。随着UVXY期权（以及-1倍VIX期货ETF
    [SVXY](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SVXY)）的出现，那些希望对基于VIX的ETP进行投机或对冲的投资者开辟了一个新的交易机会宇宙。最令人鼓舞的是，投资者现在可以利用期权轻松地以定义（有限）风险的仓位交易VIX产品。关于这一点稍后再详细介绍。
