# Humble Student of the Markets: Saved by Fibonacci

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2022/09/saved-by-fibonacci.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2022/09/saved-by-fibonacci.html#0001-01-01)

**Mid-week market update**

: I suggested on the weekend that the stock market was oversold and poised for a short-term rally (see

[How to trade the failed breadth thrust](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2022/09/04/how-the-trade-the-failed-breadth-thrust/)

). The rally seems to have arrived.

The weakness in the S&P 500 has been stunning as it sliced through multiple levels of support like a hot knife through butter. The decline was halted at the last remaining support was the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level, which also coincided with a volume support zone. 

Saved by Fibonacci! The logical initial upside resistance is the 50 dma at 4020 on the S&P 500, or 401.25 on SPY.
