- en: In a week in which most securities drifted lower on uninspired volume, [gold](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/gold)
    was a notable exception, jumping 4.1% as tensions between India and Pakistan increasingly
    point toward the possibility of a military confrontation while violence in the
    Gaza Strip between Israel and Hamas is escalating.

- en: Against the backdrop of potential conflict in either Gaza or the India-Pakistan
    region, gold surged above the critical 840 mark and ended the week at 871\. As
    the uppermost of the two dashed black lines in the [chart of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week)
    shows, resistance from previous November-December 2007 highs was pierced this
    week. Gold also broke out of a down trending channel (solid black lines) this
    week and is now setting up for a possible large bullish move. If gold continues
    to rise, look for gold miners ([GDX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/GDX))
    to be even more volatile and likely outperform the commodity or the popular gold
    bullion ETF, [GLD](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/GLD).
