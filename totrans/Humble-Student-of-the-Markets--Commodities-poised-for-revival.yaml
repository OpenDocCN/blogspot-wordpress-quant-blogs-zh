- en: Yesterday's stock market selloff was an event that we haven't seen in some time,
    as major averages fell over 1% across the board - and globally. Nevertheless,
    I saw a glimmer of hope for the bulls, as commodities were performing well despite
    the carnage. If a deep cyclical sector like that is displaying rising relative
    strength, it suggests that the end of this correction may not be too far off.

    of investor capitulation. The chart below from BoAML shows the aggregate large
    speculator (read: hedge fund) net position from the Commitment of Traders report
    in the CRB Index. Large speculators have liquidated their net long positions from
    a near crowded long level to net short. Moreover, readings are consistent where
    declines have halted in the past.'

    below of the relative performance of the junior TSX Venture Index against the
    more senior TSX Composite is at all-time lows - and below the level of the capitulation
    lows seen following the Lehman Crisis.

    consistent with a relatively upbeat outlook for growth economic growth. In that
    case, the environment for equities is encouraging and any correction should be
    relatively shallow - barring any macro surprises,
