I have a feeling that this would be important to Aleri and Streambase. I welcome comments from both companies (Jon and Mark?) to explain if and how they might use it (Streambase with Smart Order Routing, Aleri with Liquidity Management).

In particular, would this affect any of the pragmatic work by Robert Almgren (who is an advisor to Streambase)?
