A guy figured out an

[interesting market niche](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-book-reviews-money-buy-131408538.html?page=1)

: book reviews.

> In the fall of 2010, Mr. Rutherford started a Web site, GettingBookReviews.com. At first, he advertised that he would review a book for $99\. But some clients wanted a chorus proclaiming their excellence. So, for $499, Mr. Rutherford would do 20 online reviews. A few people needed a whole orchestra. For $999, he would do 50.

> There were immediate complaints in online forums that the service was violating the sacred arm’s-length relationship between reviewer and author. But there were also orders, a lot of them. Before he knew it, he was taking in $28,000 a month.

The model was rather simple. He took the money and then went to Craigslist and advertised for reviewers, $15 for an Amazon review. If they gave it less than the maximum 5 stars, they still got $7.50, but needless to say this rarely happened.

 One reviewer wrote enough 50-300 word reviews to make $12,500 in a few months, mainly by simply getting information off the internet to sound knowledgeable. This business model ultimately imploded, but he was plucky enough to try a new model that is pretty close to the incestuous business of book blurbing: have authors trade positive reviews. This failed as most authors wanted to receive more than give.

However, given all the 5 star reviews on Amazon there are clearly many

less obviously employing this tactic; the key seems not getting outed like Mr. Rutherford.
