    America) have VIX-based ETNs and ETFs (in the case of ProShares) in registration
    or have made announcements about forthcoming products, but I am unaware of any
    target launch dates.  In order to simplify matters a little, henceforth I will
    start to refer to these products as exchange-traded products or ETPs.

    Direxion or Bank of America products) and have coded these with a one or two letter
    suffix to identify the issuer (P for ProShares, D for Direxion, C for Citigroup,
    J for Jefferies and BA for Bank of America.) ETPs that are currently traded are
    in bold blue; ETPs that have not yet been launched are in red font.

    which represent the five approaches currently being used for VIX-based ETPs. For
    all intents and purposes, the ETPs in each cluster are (or appear to be, at this
    juncture) equivalent in construction and should behave in a similar manner. Group
    #1 for instance, has been the dominant theme in the volatility ETP space to date.
    The focus here is on VIX futures with a constant maturity of 30 days. VXX was
    the first to market, but competitive offerings from Jefferies and ProShares are
    on the way. Group #2 uses a similar approach, but with a 5-month target maturity.
    Group #3 is the inverse of Group #1.'
