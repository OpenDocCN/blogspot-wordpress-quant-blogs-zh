    efficiency and stability, a topic which hasn't received much attention in the
    economics literature until recently. The point of the essay was to explore two
    distinct recent studies which suggest that adding more derivative instruments
    to markets tends to make them less stable, even if they do push markets toward
    the ideal of market completeness and efficiency.

    studies I mentioned, but as publication arrived very quickly and I've been pressed
    with other deadlines I haven't yet managed to write the post as I wanted. However,
    I can at least offer some information with the idea of updating it very shortly
    (later today, Thursday 25 August).

- en: by Matteo Marsili is quite technical and relies for parts of its analysis on
    ideas and techniques imported from physics. I will tomorrow try to give some simplified
    discussion of the gist of this argument. What makes this particularly fascinating
    is that it works fully within the confines of standard general equilibrium models,
    and examines how market stability should evolve as the market approaches the ideal
    of market completeness. Agents are assumed to be fully rational, there are no
    problems with asymmetric information, etc. Even here, however, Marsili finds that
    the equilibrium becomes more and more unstable as the ideal is approached. Efficient
    markets are also unstable markets.

    a market with informed (fundamentalist) traders and non-informed (noise) traders,
    and shows, first, that the market becomes efficient as the number of informed
    traders grows. They are assumed in the model to have different kinds of private
    information about market outcomes, and the market becomes efficient, roughly speaking,
    once there are enough traders to cover the space of outcomes so all private information
    gets aggregated into market prices. The paper then introduces a non-informed trader
    -- a chartist or trend follower -- and shows that this trader has a maximum impact
    on the market precisely at the point at which it becomes efficient. The conclusion
    is very much against standard economic thinking:'

    This study looks explicitly at how the proliferation of financial instruments
    (derivatives) provides more means for diversifying and sharing risks and takes
    the market to an efficient state. However, it finds that this state is what physicists
    refer to as a "critical state", which is a state characterized by extreme (essentially
    infinite) susceptibility to small disturbances. Any small noise stirs up huge
    fluctuations. Again, efficiency trails instability in its wake. As the paper asserts:'

    arbitrage works to keep market in an efficient state) may not be compatible with
    a stable market dynamics.

    to be thought of as a public good because well functioning markets do help everyone.
    But like most public goods, private individuals acting in their own interests
    will not likely provide it.

    (or make it grow) into the future. They do this by investing in various instruments
    provided by a sector of financial firms. These investors are assumed to be rational
    and have full information and they invest their wealth optimally over the set
    of possible investments.

    on risks in supplying them. They also act optimally, and they hedge their risks
    by trading between themselves. Again, the firms are rational and have full information.

- en: Marsili then studies what happens to this world of investors and financial firms
    optimally making decisions as the number of different financial instruments grows.
    The first result confirms expectations -- the financial firms are ever more successful
    in hedging their risks and they can provide the financial instruments more cheaply.
    Investors can therefore invest more effectively. The market becomes efficient.

    arise: equilibrium portfolios develop a marked susceptibility to idiosynchratic
    shocks and/or parameter uncertainty and hedging engenders divergent trading volumes
    in the interbank market. Combining these, suggests an inverse relation between
    financial stability and the size of the financial sector...'

    and the financial firms becomes hugely sensitive to tiny shocks to the economy.
    As the efficient state is approached, these agents have to work ever harder to
    adjust their holdings to remain in the optimal condition. The market only remains
    efficient through an ever faster and more vigorous churning of investment positions.
    This shows up in the hedging done by the financial firms, where the volume of
    trading required to remain optimally hedged actually becomes infinite as the market
    reaches efficiency.

- en: All three of these papers show much the same thing -- efficiency bringing instability
    along with it. But this latter paper may be the most interesting as it shows directly
    how the size of the financial sector also naturally explodes as this efficient-unstable
    regime is approached. The effect sounds suspiciously like what has happened in
    the past 30 years or so with massive growth in the financial industries in most
    developed nations.

    models that economists have been using for a long time to make arguments about
    market efficiency. Why did it take a physicist to look at what happens to stability
    at the same point? This seems bizarre indeed.
