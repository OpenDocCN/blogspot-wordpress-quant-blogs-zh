- en: I have been considering asking my team to start exploring Oslo and M in order
    to create a DSL for automated testing of all of our systems, including the entire
    workflow for our Equity Derivatives traders. But, Microsoft's (non) strategy around
    Oslo, M, and Quadrant has me looking elsewhere .... back to the old standbys of
    Yacc/Lex or Antlr.

    in Capital Markets?
