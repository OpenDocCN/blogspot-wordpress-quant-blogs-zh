    an attack on Syria. But why should the market be nervous? Is it because of a spike
    in oil prices? Syria is not a major oil and gas producer and oil prices should
    normalize once the political situation calms down. On that basis, the knee-jerk
    sell on Middle East turmoil response is unwarranted.
