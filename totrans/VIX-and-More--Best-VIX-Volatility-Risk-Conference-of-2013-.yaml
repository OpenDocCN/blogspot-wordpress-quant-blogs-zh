- en: I am going to go out on a limb and project that the second annual [CBOE Risk
    Management Conference (RMC) Europe](http://www.cboermceurope.com/), which is held
    at the [Penha Longa Resort](http://www.penhalonga.com/en/Photo-Tour) in [Sintra,
    Portugal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sintra) from September 30 – October 2,
    will be the best conference of the year for those who are interested in the VIX,
    volatility, risk and other related subjects.

    and an [agenda](http://www.cboermceurope.com/agenda.html) that should entice any
    *VIX and More* reader, the setting for this year’s RMC Europe event is almost
    impossible to top. I understand that rooms at the Penha Longa Resort are filling
    up quickly, so I urge any European readers other those who are interested in flying
    in some more far-flung destinations, to make [reservations](http://www.cboermceurope.com/)
    sooner rather than later.

    head over the Nazare to find [100 foot waves to surf](http://vimeo.com/58536269),
    take in the history and gastronomy of Lisbon (not to mention the local beverage
    opportunities ranging from [Vinho Verde](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/03/dining/vinho-verde-portuguese-for-cheap-and-cheerful.html)
    to [port](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_wine)), or check out the [scenic local

    in odd years and is typically held in late February or March. Next year will mark
    the 30^(th) annual installment of the U.S. version of the RMC and will run March
    17 – 19 at the Hyatt Regency Coconut Point in Bonita Springs, Florida.

- en: Much to my chagrin, I will not be attending RMC Europe this year, but I intend
    to be in Bonita Springs in March and also to find my way to wherever the 2014
    RMC Europe event is being held, come hell or high water.

    about your experience and some of your key takeaways in the volatility space.
