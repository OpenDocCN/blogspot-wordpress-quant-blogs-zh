- en: Things will likely not be boring in the markets going  into year end. After
    such a large run, clients are desperate to participate and portfolio managers
    are under pressure to show that they have participated. That said, one could make
    the argument that fund managers sitting on large gains will be desperate to lock
    in profits and avoid giving up ground going into year end. It is hard to say which
    will occur, but my bet is that we are due for a large move heading into January.
    If cornered to choose a side, I would bet on further strength into year end because
    of favorable seasonality and the overall feeling I get that  profit desperation
    outweights caution. So strap on your seatbelts and get ready for a wild ride!
