    the rally last week was breathtaking), even if you are bearish, I wouldn't be
    too eager to commit to a bearish trade here. There are just too many bullish triggers
    over the next few days that could rip the face off anyone positioned to the short
    side.

    EU, then the outcome is much hard to predict.
