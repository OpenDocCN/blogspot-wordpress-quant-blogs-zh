    stated policies. Instead I look at the candidate's overall philosophy to see how
    he or she would govern. Politicians change their minds. What's more important
    is how they would behave when circumstances change.

    Western gunships and financiers pushed into East Asia. Nothing Japan or China
    could have done would have stopped the rise of Western wealth and power. ***How
    they reacted to that rise, however, made all the difference between triumph and
    tragedy.***

    and China was the sick man of Asia.

    country, it would actually look like a model economy, with a small current account
    surplus, a primary budget deficit of less than half that of the UK and the US,
    subdued household debt, low inflation and a little growth.

    have said repeatedly that Europe has the capability to solve the problem themselves.
    If we were to take Trichet's comment at face value, then the obvious way forward
    is fiscal union, to be followed by political union at some point in the future.
    The alternative is to kick some of the weaker countries out of the eurozone at
    the price of fracturing European unity. But then, what countries don't have underperforming
    regions? In the United States, you just have to compare the glittering metropolises
    of New York, Boston and Los Angeles with parts of the Deep South, or Puerto Rico,
    to see examples.

    and half-measures that don't always achieve the original stated objective and
    have the potential to fail because of some fatal flaw. When the euro was formed,
    I recall that there was some question as to some of the weaker Club Med countries
    would be allowed into the eurozone. I suppose that, in the end, countries like
    Greece and Portugal were allowed in the spirit of European unity and the tradition
    of European compromise.

    have to endure yet another existential crisis. It is all very well to talk of
    discipline and oversight right now, when disaster is still an imminent possibility;
    but wariness is bound to fade with time. Bubbles inflate precisely because people
    fail to recognise that they are living with dangerous imbalances. One French official
    remembers being told by commission economists during the boom to copy Ireland
    and Spain. Now the same people are telling him to copy Germany.

    the weaker countries get kicked out of the euro will be irrelevant in 100 years,
    but both roads will be hard. What matters is a robust solution, and not a weak
    half-measure, is implemented.
