    an expanded EFSF to  €440 billion and German's guarantee rises from  €123 billion
    to  €211 billion. While this step is constructive, it amounts to giving a terminal
    cancer patient a massage - the long-term results are still the same.

    The measures that European countries are agreeing to allow the €440bn fund to
    buy the debt of distressed European countries such as Greece, give financial help
    to banks and lend money to cash-strapped governments. To the optimists this all
    looked very impressive in July. But it looks all very puny now. It's a solution

    is to be used for (initially investors were told the facility was not to be used
    for bank bailouts but that looks likely to change). And if an EFSF guarantor reneges
    on its guarantee then there’s no payback (so if Slovakia pulls out, Germany just
    ends up guaranteeing more).

    and probably need bailing out. If problem (3) is somehow overcome, then that means
    more EFSF bonds. But then you run into the problem of fungibility. Each EFSF bond
    has different guarantors, so the first EFSF bond was issued in January to bail
    out Ireland. Portugal remains to this day one of the guarantors for that particular
    bond, despite Portugal itself also needing to be bailed out (the two subsequent
    EFSF issues were to bail out Portugal, of which obviously neither Portugal nor
    Ireland are guarantors)...
