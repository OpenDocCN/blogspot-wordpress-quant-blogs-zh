# Humble Student of the Markets: Yield curve: Correlation vs. causation edition

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2016/05/yield-curve-correlation-vs-causation.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2016/05/yield-curve-correlation-vs-causation.html#0001-01-01)

Further to my last post (see

[Three steps and a stumble?](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/05/22/three-steps-and-a-stumble/)

), I would like to clear up some misconceptions about how I interpret the yield curve and its investment implications. Much of the confusion revolves around the idea of correlation vs. causation.

***Yield curve inversions don't cause anything. Yield curve inversions are a signal (correlation) of certain effects that have important investment implications.***

In this post, I will address the following topics:

*   Yield curve and recessions
*   Yield curve and credit conditions
*   Yield curve and equity bear markets
