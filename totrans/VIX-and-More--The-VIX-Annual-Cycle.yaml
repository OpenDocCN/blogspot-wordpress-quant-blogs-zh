    VIX [seasonal patterns](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/seasonality)
    in [A Month By Month Look at the VIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/01/month-by-month-look-at-vix.html).
    Since the original post I have received quite a few requests to update the chart
    with more recent data.

    I am pleased to broaden the seasonal picture of the VIX with a current version
    of 19 years of VIX data as a composite [annual cycle](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/annual%20cycle).
    The chart below has changed very little from the January 2007 version. In fact,
    2008 followed the historical patterns established in previous years almost perfectly,
    with the VIX increasing in the January-March period, dropping through May and
    June, then spiking dramatically in September and October.

    the more times volatility wanders down this same seasonal path, the more time
    traders will be looking for a repeat in the following year.
