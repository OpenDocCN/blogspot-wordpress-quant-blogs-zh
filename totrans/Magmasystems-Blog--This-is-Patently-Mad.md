Financial Services firms

[rushing](http://news.moneycentral.msn.com/provider/providerarticle.aspx?feed=FT&Date=20061229&ID=6307763)

to the patent office.

[Details](http://gauss.ffii.org/PatentView/EP1305762)

of a Goldman patent for reducing volatility. And

[this](http://www.freepatentsonline.com/EP1369805.html)

is the patent that Goldman just got for diddling.

What does this mean for small companies developing financial software? I know a few people developing new trading packages which they hope to sell. Hope you guys are engaging a patent attorney.

Whenever I came out with a new product through Magma Systems, the first thing I would do was to copyright the code. At that time, you needed to send the "first 100 and last 100 pages" of the souce code to the copyright office.
