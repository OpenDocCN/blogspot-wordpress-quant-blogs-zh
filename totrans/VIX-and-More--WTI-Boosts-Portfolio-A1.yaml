- en: After a challenging start to the new year that resulted in a major reshuffling
    of the portfolio, it looks as if Portfolio A1 is now back on track with an interesting
    cross-section of holdings.  Part of the credit for the performance turnaround
    should go to [W&T Offshore (WTI)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=wti), the
    oil and gas exploration and production company that gained 9.2% in the first week
    it was in the portfolio.  A five stock portfolio is always a crap shoot of sorts,
    but given the current market environment and opportunities it presents, I am pleased
    with the current makeup of the portfolio.

    a cumulative performance of +4.8% vs. a -8.5% performance in the benchmark S&P
    500 index over the same period.

    which is being replaced by [Invitrogen (IVGN)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=ivgn),
    a lab testing and diagnostic company that just last week [reported solid earnings
    and resolved some patent disputes](http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/080206/earns_invitrogen.html?.v=1).  For
    those looking for more information on IVGN, a good place to start is with the
    [conference call transcript](http://seekingalpha.com/article/63272-invitrogen-corp-q4-2007-earnings-call-transcript?source=yahoo)
    from the February 5, 2008 conference call.
