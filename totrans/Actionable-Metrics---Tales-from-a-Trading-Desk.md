## Actionable Metrics

I’ve always been a fan of [Kanban](https://www.agilealliance.org/resources/experience-reports/actionable-metrics-siemens-health-services/).  [Actionable Agile](https://www.actionableagile.com/publications/) provide an interesting read on how actionable flow metrics (Work In Progress, Cycle Time, Throughput) are used to reduced Cycle Times, which leads to faster delivery of business value stories to the end users 🙂

Finally,  “no more estimation” (story points) using instead [predictability](https://vimeo.com/146545310) 🙂
