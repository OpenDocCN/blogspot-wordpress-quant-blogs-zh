- en: 'The geometric mean is the average derived by compounding different momentums
    or price returns. In contrast the arithmetic mean is simple the average of different
    momentums or price returns. The geometric return is often quite different from
    the arithmetic mean return–this divergence is a source of valuable information.
    At the limit, the geometric mean and the arithmetic should converge. This means
    that if one strays too far from the other, it is likely to return to normal. This
    is especially true in shorter-term series, where positive divergence between the
    geometric mean and arithmetic mean is negative for future stock prices.In contrast
    the opposite effect occurs with longer term price series–where a positive divergence
    is actually favorable for future stock prices.. This excerpt is derived from wikipedia

    the fact that both arithmetic and geometric means of two numbers both lie between
    them). Thus, from Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, there exists a convergent subsequence

    buying into weakness and selling into strength for the S&P500 all the way back
    to 1955 not including the 1997-2009 period!   The average weekly return prior
    to buy signals was -.3%, and sell signals were given when weekly returns were
    .42%.  **When the oscillator was below .5 (oversold), the market returned 6% compounded
    from 1955-2009 not including dividends. When the oscillator was above .5 (overbought),
    the market made 0.0016%**!

- en: The creation of the oscillator involves taking the arithmetic average of the
    percentage returns (or 1-day ROCs) over the last 5 days.  A geometric return is
    created by simply adding 1 to the percentage returns and taking the product of
    this series over the last 5 days (the cumulative return). The geometric return
    for this oscillator is derived by taking subracting 1 from  the cumulative return
    . Then we subtract the arithmetic return from the geometric return to find the
    divergence. This divergence is smoothed twice using a 3-day average to create
    smooth signals*(note that the raw divergence produces signals in the same direction).
    Finally this smoothed divergence is “bounded,” by taking the PERCENTRANK of the
    series going back 1-year.
