    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    bubbles to be wary of. The subsequent housing boom created a subprime bubble,
    which was facilitated by cheap financing, and wild leverage in the financial system
    that eventually led to a crisis. Now everyone is a bubble hunter.

    all asset classes, and it can be seen in the diving 10-year Treasury yield; the
    deeply negative 10-year Bund yield and the growing count of negative yielding
    European fixed income instruments; and even the forex market, as evidenced by
    the cratering NZDJPY cross, which is a bellwether of the carry trade. The big
    surprise is US equities have held up reasonably well in this fearful environment.

    during the past 18 months, according to fresh data from Goldman Sachs. Being Underweight
    is another way of Wall Street saying it expects the U.S. trade war with China
    to overly hurt companies with outsized exposure to the country and likely, and
    its stock prices.

    Goldman’s research shows hedge funds are Underweight information technology (trade
