    lead to higher mortality from many dimensions, but primarily arterial sclerosis.
    He did original work examining baboon troops and found glucocorticoid levels inversely
    correlated with status, mainly because when you are low status you are often randomly
    slapped by a higher ranking baboon venting frustration, or have your hard earned
    meals swiped.

    therapy to take out a recent slight by smacking some random lower ranking baboon,
    as he measured their stress levels before and after (Sapolsky notes that, with
    some exceptions, he doesn't really like baboons; they're mean). Further, another
    thing that raises stress is fighting for position in the hierarchy, so when a
    new alpha male comes into the troop and everyone has to compete again for position,
    this is stressful. Think of a baboon leadership change as a recession, in that
    the creative destruction from new leadership may help the troop in the long run,
    but in the short run everyone feels worse.

    status levels. Stress isn’t mainly caused by objective insults, but rather subjective
    ones, primarily feeling under appreciated. This is highlighted by Sapolsky's own
    work, which noted that human subjects glucocorticoid levels increased when faced
    with stressful social evaluations, not when faced with merely difficult logic
    puzzles. He can't escape his Marxist instincts and goes for dialectical materialism,
    where the structure of production implies classes, alienation, and angst.  I see

    asides about how inequality or ignorance is merely a choice of an indifferent
    society, and that obviously if we wanted to, we could spend more on the poor and
    look just like Sweden. After spending trillions of dollars on Third World aid,
    and on the War on Poverty here in America, this is clearly not true. Americans
    have not chosen more inequality out of indifference to the poor, rather, it''s
    an emergent response to our naive attempts to directly rectify these inequalities:

- en: It is somewhat sad to think that so many humans suffer angst thinking about
    things like mortgage payments or how our children will fare, while Zebras are
    pretty stress-free as long as lions or dominant males are not messing with them.
     Thus, they don't get ulcers because if the stressor isn't right in front of them,
    it isn't there.  It gets back to Socrates' question as to whether you would prefer
    being a happy pig or an unhappy human.  Surely, once you've take the blue pill
    you can't go back, but it's not obvious to me that many unhappy humans would have
    had a better life as a happy pig.
