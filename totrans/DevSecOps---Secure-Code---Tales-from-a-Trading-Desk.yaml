    every piece of code every line of code that they write their supposed to scan
    this prior to committing that to the repos. Once it’s in the repos, once we get
    ready to deploy and merge in a master at that point that runs again, right, the
    same tool runs within a CI CD pipeline, after we’re doing, QA testing, and all
    these other things that run also is an automated tool set, it runs again, at that
    point, it notifies us or notifies them right of vulnerabilities resident, now
    we can choose to block that we can choose to say, hey, if it’s a critical vulnerability,
    or a high severity vulnerability, we’re going to disable or block the push right
    to production”
