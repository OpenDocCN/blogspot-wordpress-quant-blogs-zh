    Electronic exchanges, and many ECNs, are organised as [limit order book](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(exchange))
    trading systems. Stock exchanges, like the [LSE](http://www.londonstockexchange.com/en-gb/),
    and futures exchanges, like [Eurex](http://www.eurexchange.com/index.html), are
    organised as limit order books. [Larry Harris](http://www.tradingandexchanges.com)
    has interesting comments to make on the interplay between limit and market orders
    on limit order books. It’s an interesting area for trading system developers,
    since broker dealer banks and hedge funds sometimes sponsor system development
    aimed at exploiting order book behaviour. Here’s some linkage…
