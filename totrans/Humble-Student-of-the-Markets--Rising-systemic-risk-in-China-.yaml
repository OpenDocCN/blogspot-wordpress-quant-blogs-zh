    either breached, or are close to, the 30pp since 2008*** (Figure 24). Asia is
    also experiencing house price booms. If we overlay residential property prices
    in the US (indexed to 100 in January 2000) on residential property prices in several
    Asian countries, it is striking how many Asian property markets are tracking above
    the US price bubble.'

    has risen for the Asia Ex-Japan region. Note how China and Hong Kong are the outliers
    and literally off the chart compared to the other countries. In the right chart,
    Nomura overlaid the path of the property prices in the pre-Lehman US to other
    countries in the region to highlight the rising level of systemic risk.
