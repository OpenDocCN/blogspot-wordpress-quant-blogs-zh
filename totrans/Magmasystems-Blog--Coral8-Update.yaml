    with Terry Cunningham (who flew his Falcon 10 out to meet us), and I had a great
    session with Henry, their

    and I was enlightened on some of Coral8's capabilities that were not so easy to
    find in their wads of documentation. Although there is much good in Coral8, there
    were also some gotchas.

- en: My opinion is that, although it is great to have the advanced features, you
    still need to pay attention on the everyday, little tasks that developers need
    to do. Henry tells me that, in the future, Coral8 will move to a more Visual Studio,
    file-based way of developing. I certainly welcome this. Henry spent 8 hours watching
    me drive. When I was having problems, I verbalized the issues so that Henry could
    see what I was going through and he could bring the issues back to his management.

    thing that I do not like is a license key that is only good for 30 days. Given
    the nature of financial companies, we often get pulled into a lot of side projects.
    I don''t want my time to be in the "thick of things", only to find out that the
    license key elapsed. Coral8 is very friendly to the evaluator.'
