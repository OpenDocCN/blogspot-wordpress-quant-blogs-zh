    I looked at some of the disappointing January economic numbers and wondered if
    these were outliers that the market should ignore or an indication that the economy
    was losing some strength.'

    the economic underpinnings of a rise in stocks. This time around the employment
    data seem to be moving in the right direction, but manufacturing has had trouble
    living up to expectations – at least for the past two months.”*'

    situation is even stronger than originally anticipated. In fact, looking back
    to the bottoming in stocks in early October, the improving employment situation
    which dates from that same period has coincided almost perfectly with an improving
    stock market. On the other hand, manufacturing and broader economic activity data
    have missed expectations more than they have exceeded them since the beginning
    of December – a trend stocks have continued to ignore.

    groups of economic activity (manufacturing/general, housing/construction, employment,
    consumer and prices/inflation) and plots the relative level of positive and negative
    surprises in each category against the performance of S&P 500 index going back
    to the beginning of 2010.

    while manufacturing would continue to post positive surprises for another two
    months or so. As expectations for the employment market ratchet upward in 2012,
    is it possible for the data to continue to deliver more bullish surprises?
