    changes. Bear markets are often periods of catharsis. The old leaders get tired,
    and they have been bid up to excessive valuations. A reality check sets in and
    they fall. As the old leaders fail, new market leaders emerge to guide a new bull
    upward.

    leadership themes in the US market, namely US over non-US, growth over value,
    and large caps over small caps. Of the three, growth continues to be extremely
    strong, US stocks have temporarily plateaued and they may be turning down, and
    small caps are resuming their underperformance after a brief three-month turnaround.

    The following chart shows the returns of different regions relative to MSCI All-Country
    World Index (ACWI). All returns are in USD so currency effects are already included
    in performance. Within the US equity market, the S&P 500 is rolling over on a
    relative basis, but the NASDAQ 100 continues to soar. A look at the developed
    markets (middle panel) shows no sustainable trends. Japan has weakened after a
    short-lived rally, and Europe's relative performance has chopped around for the
    past few months. It is the emerging markets (bottom panel) that has shown the
    greatest promise in leadership. While it is true that EM equities have soared
    in relative performance, EM xChina stocks are tracing out a constructive but unexciting
    saucer bottoming pattern. By inference, it is China that has become the global
    market leader.

    rest on the narrow leadership of a handful of NASDAQ stocks and the Chinese market?
