    four-factor model that included momentum, weren't really economic theories. They
    were exercises in data mining, with dubious explanations tacked on after the fact.
    What's more, they were exercises in data mining that revealed several time-honored
    Wall Street strategies--dismissed by finance scholars since the 1960s as folklore
    or worse--to be consistent money makers.

    are data mined because they are prominently used by academics and practitioners
    for benchmarking, so either everyone's an idiot, or we have some explaining to
    do. I go over the anomalie soup that gave rise to size and value. How the size
    effect was initially >15%, now <1%. What did they initially represent? Financial
    distress. That didn't work. Measure distress independently and you get a very
    strong, and anomalous negative relationship. Hmmm. Fama and French's factors--the
    market, size, and value--are the most dominant risk factors applied outside the
    Capital Asset pricing Model's singular 'beta' model. They are ubiquitous in the
    academic literature and also in fund style guides.

    that CAPM betas does not work.
