- en: I spent way too much time this weekend on my computer refactoring Excelsior
    to further enforce the separation between the Long Short Equity example and the
    Excelsior framework.  This should make it much easier to see what classes need
    to be implemented when developing a new strategy with Excelsior. You can get the
    latest code from SourceForge. Beware though that this new version has not been
    tested at all! I’ll try to get to that next weekend.
