- en: Now that stock prices have recovered from their March lows to all-time highs,
    it's time to admit that I was wrong about my excess cautiousness. I present a
    new framework for analyzing the stock market. While the new framework is useful
    for explaining why the major US market indices have reached fresh highs, it does
    not necessarily have bullish implications.

- en: My previous excessive cautiousness was based on two factors, valuation and a
    weak economic outlook. The market is trading at a forward P/E ratio of 22, which
    is extremely high by historical standards. Moreover, it was difficult to believe
    that the economy and stock prices could recover that strongly in the face of the
    second worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.

    whether it's a V, W, L or some other shape. The reality is a K-shaped bifurcated
    rebound. This bifurcation is occurring in two separate and distinct dimensions,
    the stock market and the path of economic growth.

    investors should view the market's future outlook.
