    no allegiance and acknowledging no responsibility to the people. To destroy this
    invisible government, to befoul this unholy alliance between corrupt business
    and corrupt politics is the ﬁrst task of statesmanship.”

    ever known. I refer to the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Banks.
    The Federal Reserve Board, a Government board, has cheated the Government of the
    United States and the people of the United States out of enough money to pay the
    national debt. The depredations and the iniquities of the Federal Reserve Board

    predatory money lenders.”

    funds.This seems dubious in the extreme to me, although I'm sure there are many
    arguments to consider. Memory recalls reading arguments about the required independence
    of the central bank, but independence is of course not the same as "control by
    the private banks." Maybe we need to change the governance of the Fed and install
    some oversight with real power from a non-banking non-governmental element.
