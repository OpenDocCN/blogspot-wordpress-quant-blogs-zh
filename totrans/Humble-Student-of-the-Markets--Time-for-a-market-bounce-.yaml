    I have marked in blue vertical lines where conditions 1 and 2 were satisfied,
    but not 3; and in red where all three were satisfied. In every one of the cases
    in the last three years, we have seen a short-term market bottom.

- en: While the three year track record of this model has been remarkable, we need
    to put the results into context as the stock market has been rising steadily since
    the 2011 bottom. Such an environment is highly conducive to a class of models
    that spot oversold conditions, without worry that the market will get even more
    oversold.

- en: I stress tested the Trifecta model in 2010 and 2011, when the market suffered
    major corrections and was far more choppy than it had been in the last three years.
    Though the results were still good, it was not perfect. The chart below shows
    the corrective period in 2010\. In one case, the model signaled a minor rebound
    that petered out in two days. In another, it was too early as the market got even
    more oversold as the market fell to its final bottom about a week later.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can see a similar pattern in 2011\. The Trifecta model was too early in August
    2011 as the market got even more oversold as it fell to its first bottom. September
    saw a number of multiple signals that were somewhat confusing. Though these multiple
    signals were consistent at flashing short-term bottoms, the stock market chopped
    around for several weeks before it began its ultimate rise.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we can see that the Trifecta model is very good at flashing an oversold extreme,
    but does this represent THE BOTTOM for the current downdraft? That depends on
    a judgement call on the kind of market environment we are in. Are we still in
    the steadily rising market environment that we have seen in the last three years,
    or are we seeing the start of more serious market correction?

    to VIX spikes. Monday's 34% VIX spike was highly unusual and he found that it
    was generally an indicator of a short-term market bottom, but stocks tended to
    fall after a 3-5 day bounce (emphasis added)

- en: Note that based on the data for the 23 VIX spikes in excess of 30%, ***the SPX
    has a tendency to outperform its long-term average over the course of the 1, 3
    and 5-day periods following the VIX spike. Also worth noting that that 10 and
    20 days following the VIX spike, the SPX has a tendency not only to underperform,
    but decline.*** Further, while the huge decline following 9/29/2008 VIX spike
    tends to dwarf the other data points, even when you remove the 9/29/2008 VIX spike
    it turns out that the SPX still loses money in the 10 and 20-day period following
    a VIX spike. When the analysis is extended out 50 trading days, the SPX is back
    to being profitable, but performing below its long-term average. On the other
    hand, when the analysis includes 100 days following the VIX spike, the SPX is
    back to outperforming its long-term average.

    the pattern in which following a 30% one-day VIX spike, there appears to generally
    be a tradable oversold condition in stocks that lasts approximately one week,
    followed by a period of another month or so in which the markets typically has
    difficulty coming to terms with the threat to stocks. One quarter later, however,
    all fears are generally in the rear view mirror and stocks are likely to have
    tacked on significant gains.

    is suggestive that we are seeing a 2010 or 2011\. If that`s so, it is consistent
    with the hypothesis that the market rallies into the July 4th long weekend and
    retreats afterwards.
