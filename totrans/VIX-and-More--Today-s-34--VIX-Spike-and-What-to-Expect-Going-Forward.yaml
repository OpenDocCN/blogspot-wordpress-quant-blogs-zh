    the second day of 2015 had a 28.1% VIX spike and then today, we saw a 34.5% VIX
    spike, the eleventh largest in the history of the VIX and enough to trigger an
    update to the table of largest one-day VIX spikes below.

    has a tendency to outperform its long-term average over the course of the 1, 3
    and 5-day periods following the VIX spike. Also worth noting that that 10 and
    20 days following the VIX spike, the SPX has a tendency not only to underperform,
    but decline. Further, while the huge decline following 9/29/2008 VIX spike tends
    to dwarf the other data points, even when you remove the 9/29/2008 VIX spike it
    turns out that the SPX still loses money in the 10 and 20-day period following
    a VIX spike. When the analysis is extended out 50 trading days, the SPX is back
    to being profitable, but performing below its long-term average. On the other
    hand, when the analysis includes 100 days following the VIX spike, the SPX is
    back to outperforming its long-term average.

    the pattern in which following a 30% one-day VIX spike, there appears to generally
    be a tradable oversold condition in stocks that lasts approximately one week,
    followed by a period of another month or so in which the markets typically has
    difficulty coming to terms with the threat to stocks. One quarter later, however,
    all fears are generally in the rear view mirror and stocks are likely to have
    tacked on significant gains.

    reversion](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/mean%20reversion), but
    calls into question the role of mean reversion in the 10-20 days following a VIX
    spike, perhaps has fundamental factors begin to win out over a technically oversold
    condition in stocks.
