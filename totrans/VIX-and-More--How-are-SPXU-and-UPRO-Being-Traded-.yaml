    Depressed by Increased Use of SPXU?](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/07/is-vix-being-artificially-depressed-by.html)
    One of the points I made is that [SPXU](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SPXU)
    could be a substitute for SPX puts (and perhaps artificially depress the VIX as
    a result) for those who are looking for leveraged ETFs as possible portfolio [hedge](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/hedging).
    To be perfectly frank, I do not believe there will be substantial demand for SPXU
    (or any of the [triple ETFs](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/triple%20ETFs))
    as portfolio hedging vehicles, largely related to the issue of the compounding
    effect (see [Understanding the Impact of Changing Market Exposure on Leveraged
    ETFs](http://www.direxionshares.com/pdfs/Compounding_Article_ETFs.pdf) from [Direxion](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Direxion)
    for more details.)

    back when they launched a month ago, I envisioned three primary uses for these
    triple ETFs:'

- en: While I did not envision SPXU as a viable hedging vehicle, this is largely because
    I was thinking in terms of a longer time frame for the hedge. If SPX puts can
    be utilized in increments of the one month options cycle, SPXU would be at a disadvantage
    trying to compete on a monthly time frame. I do believe, however, that SPXU can
    be a viable hedge for more than just a single trading session or an occasional
    two day sequence, as many have suggested. Depending on volatility levels, SPXU
    hedges can be left in place for up to three days with minimal risk of losses due
    to compounding. In my opinion, only when holding periods start to exceed four
    days does an SPXU hedge start to become inefficient.

    of this product is now assured. While the value of SPXU as a hedging instrument
    pales in comparison to other possible applications, I do think SPXU can be used
    as an effective hedge for periods of 2-3 days at a time with an acceptable degree
    of compounding risk.
