# Humble Student of the Markets: Smart money postured for a recession

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2008/02/smart-money-postured-for-recession.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2008/02/smart-money-postured-for-recession.html#0001-01-01)

There are many ways of defining *smart* money. I had a recent [post](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2008/02/idiots-equity-market-neutral-fund.html) describing a synthetic market neutral fund using a group of *smart funds* as a way of generating alpha. Using the technique shown in the sidebar (titled *Reverse Engineering a Manager's Macro Exposure*) I imputed the macro and sector exposures of these “smart funds" and “consensus funds”, which consists of 22 US large cap blend equity mutual funds from the major fund complexes. I found the following significant differences in their bets:

*   *Smart funds* are more overweight large caps, which tends to be more defensive
*   *Smart funds* are more aggressively underweight Financials, indicating that their managers don’t believe that the subprime fallout is over
*   Consensus funds are still overweight the Consumer Cyclicals while *smart funds* are market weight or underweight

In whole, this analysis points to a picture suggesting that this group of smart fund managers are orienting their portfolio to a recession or economic slowdown, while the larger consensus funds are not yet moved that way yet.

*Smart funds* are more overweight large capitalization stocks, which are thought to perform better in bear markets and recessions.

*Smart funds* obviously don't believe that the subprime fallout is over as they are aggressively underweight Financials, which is about 20% of the weight of the market. On the other hand, consensus funds are roughly market weight.

Surprisingly, consensus funds are significantly overweight Consumer Cyclicals, while *smart funds* are market or underweight.
