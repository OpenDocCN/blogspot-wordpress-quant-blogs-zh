    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    even bears like me by surprise. My social media feed has been filled with extreme
    bearishness. Opinions are now becoming bifurcated. Either the decline is the signal
    of something big, or the fall in stock prices represent a buying opportunity for
    fundamentally oriented investors.

    of what the market is discounting. In other words, what bet are you making if
    you decide to buy or sell stocks here?

    in 1H 2019, but no recession. From a technical perspective, both the US and global
    markets have violated well-defined uptrend lines, just as they did in 2015 and
    2007\. It remains an open question as to whether the trend line breakdowns will
    result in just a mild pullback, or a deeper bear market. (Please note that the
    curves and arrows drawn on the charts are only stylized, and do not represent
    technical projections or targets).
