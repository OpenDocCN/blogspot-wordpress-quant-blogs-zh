- en: We have started to do pair interviewing in my current job. One of the best interviews
    that I ever had was a CSFB, where I was in a room with 6 people for a 2 hour grilling.
    One person would ask a question, I would answer, then another person would pick
    up on that thread and delve deeper.

- en: I am certainly an advocate of team interviews... for some reason, I think that
    it is less stressful for a candidate to be in a room with several people, realizing
    that he does not have to bounce from person to person, giving the same recap of
    his career over and over again. It also gives the interviewers a chance to feed
    off of eachother, and to see how the other person conducted interviewing at other
    jobs. Between my colleague and I, we have probably interviewed 500 .NET candidates
    over the past few years.
