# Humble Student of the Markets: Here comes the growth scare

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2019/02/here-comes-growth-scare.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2019/02/here-comes-growth-scare.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models**

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post,

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The

**Trend Model**

is an asset allocation model which applies trend following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or contraction (bearish)?"

My inner trader uses a

**trading model**

, which is a blend of price momentum (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa). Subscribers receive real-time alerts of model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of the those email alerts are updated weekly

. The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that began in March 2016 is shown below.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Sell equities*
*   Trend Model signal: Neutral*
*   Trading model: Bullish*

**Bullish and bearish over different time frames**

I was recently asked to clarify my market views, as they appear to have been contradictory. Let me make this clear, I am both bullish and bearish, but over different time horizons.

I expect that the U.S. equity market should perform well into the end of 2019\. The recent Zweig Breadth Thrust signal on January 7 (see

[A Rare “What’s My Credit Card Limit” Buy Signal](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2019/01/07/a-rare-what-my-credit-card-limit-buy-signal/)

) has historically seen higher prices over longer time frames. Exhibitions of powerful price momentum have historically been very bullish.

[Troy Bombardia](https://twitter.com/bullmarketsco/status/1093263677870944256)

recently pointed out that the NYSE McClellan Summation Index (NYSI) recently exceeded 850, and past episodes have resolved bullishly. My own shorter-term study shows that the market was higher 75% of the time after one month with an average return of 1.8%, and higher 83.3% of the time after three months with an average return of 3.9%.

However, I do have some concerns about the possibility of stock price weakness over the next few months. As we pointed out last week (see

[Recession Ahead? Fuggedaboutit!](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2019/02/03/recession-ahead-fuggedaboutit/)

), the market is likely to be spooked by growth slowdown as we approach Q2\. Evidence of a growth scare is already emerging.

**A Special Announcement**

We told you so. We told you the market was going down.

Here is the track of

***Humble Student of the Markets***

, where we are neither perma-bulls nor perma-bears. Most recently, we have been correctly bullish since the correction of 2015, and turned cautious in August 2018 (see

[Market top ahead? My inner investor turns cautious,](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2018/08/05/major-top-ahead-my-inner-investor-turns-cautious/)

August 5, 2018).

We were also timely at the 2009 bottom. We issued a call to buy beaten up low-priced stocks with high insider buying a week before the ultimate bottom (see

[Phoenix rising?](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2009/02/phoenix-rising.html)

 February 24, 2009).

***The out-of-sample record of our model trading portfolio in 2018 was up 42.9%***

. For more details, see our weekly updates
