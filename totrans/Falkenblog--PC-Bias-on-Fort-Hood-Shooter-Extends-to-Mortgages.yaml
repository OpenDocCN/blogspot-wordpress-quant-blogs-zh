    or a broad pattern, depending on the preconception. The major media and the White
    House have a strong belief that Muslim extremism is idiosyncratic and mainly irrelevant.

    Hood' (who's this 'we' kemosabe?). Obama cautioned against '

    unarmed American kids, as opposed to an unintended accident caused by students

    towards easier lending criteria, let alone reverse it. If the statistical disparity
    was simply due to bigoted discrimination, closing the gap would be costless. As
    they say, things always end badly, otherwise, they wouldn't end. Once subprime
    blew up, sticking with the Marxist narrative right-thinking people were quick
    to blame banks for forcing ill-advised mortgages on minorities.

    any behavior by socially disadvantaged groups as more evidence of their victimization
    by the dominant majority. Policies predicated on mistaken assumptions make things
    worse. By promoting the belief that bigotry accounts for most of every disadvantaged
    group disparity, the PC elites are doing more harm than good to everyone. Their
    bad solutions are then applied to everyone, creating a race to the bottom based
    on great intentions.
