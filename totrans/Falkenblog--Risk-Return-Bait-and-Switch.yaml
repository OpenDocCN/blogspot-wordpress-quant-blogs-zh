    returns. It goes up a bit as you go from Treasuries, or overnight loans, to the
    slightly less safe BBB bonds, or 3 year maturities. But that's it, that's all
    you get for merely taking the psychic pain of risk. Just as septic tank cleaners
    do not make more than average, or teachers of unruly students do not make more
    than average, merely investing in something highly volatile does not generate
    automatic compensation. Getting rich has never been merely an ability to withstand
    some obvious discomfort.

    luminiferous aether pervaded 19th century physics. It's everywhere and explains
    everything (eg, why did markets fluctuate yesterday? The risk premium was moving!);
    it is also impossible to measure. One thing it certainly is not, however, is mere
    volatility. High beta stocks, and high volatility stocks, ha

    a factor that proxies our 'marginal utility of wealth', often thought to be something
    like the S&P500 index. It is not 'total volatility', 'total non-diversifiable
    volatility', or a covariance with anything, well, intuitive--we've tried everything
    intuitive. The theory does not work in horse racing, lotteries, junk bonds, private-equity,
    temporal volatility, options, within equities, options on equities, the yield
    curve > 3 years, among other investments.

    that has been going on for 50 years, and yet academics still believe it exists
    the same way any true believer knows the truth regardless of evidence. The triumph
    of theory over data is a powerful thing.

    and sister who decide to have sex (with full protection), and who then decide
    it was a fun special moment. He then asks people, 'was that wrong?' Modern students
    generally say they don't have a problem with people doing things that don't hurt
    others, and in this hypothetical, no one was hurt. Yet most everyone finds it
    objectionable. So when pressed as to why they don't like it, they first offer
    reasons like 'they will have defective children', even though the risk of pregnancy
    was assumed zero, or 'it's illegal', when that point is moot because this takes
    place in France, where it is legal.

    Basically, our brains don't like it, and we first reach for the obvious reasons

    our beliefs.

    presented with a simple graph that superficially works, he uses it as proof. He
    cherry picks asset classes where this works, and ignores the ones where it does
    not. For an experienced finance academic this risk-return nexus is burned into
    his neurons like our aversion to the smell of toe jam, they know it's true, regardless
    of what the data say. It's an answer that works for his naive MBA students, and

    related to returns." Finance theory says nothing about this. Our theory relates
    risk to "expected returns" not ex-post returns. To be clear, "risk" should also
    be expected. I emphasize this in my class. I accept your critique of my graph
    which should have been labeled "Average Historical Returns" vs. "Standard Deviation
    of Returns."
