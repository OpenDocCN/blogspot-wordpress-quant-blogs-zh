    returns. It goes up a bit as you go from Treasuries, or overnight loans, to the
    slightly less safe BBB bonds, or 3 year maturities. But that's it, that's all
    you get for merely taking the psychic pain of risk. Just as septic tank cleaners
    do not make more than average, or teachers of unruly students do not make more
    than average, merely investing in something highly volatile does not generate
    automatic compensation. Getting rich has never been merely an ability to withstand
    some obvious discomfort.

    a factor that proxies our 'marginal utility of wealth', often thought to be something
    like the S&P500 index. It is not 'total volatility', 'total non-diversifiable
    volatility', or a covariance with anything, well, intuitive--we've tried everything
    intuitive. The theory does not work in horse racing, lotteries, junk bonds, private-equity,
    temporal volatility, options, within equities, options on equities, the yield
    curve > 3 years, among other investments.

    generally say they don't have a problem with people doing things that don't hurt
    others, and in this hypothetical, no one was hurt. Yet most everyone finds it
    objectionable. So when pressed as to why they don't like it, they first offer
    reasons like 'they will have defective children', even though the risk of pregnancy
    was assumed zero, or 'it's illegal', when that point is moot because this takes
    place in France, where it is legal.

    related to returns." Finance theory says nothing about this. Our theory relates
    risk to "expected returns" not ex-post returns. To be clear, "risk" should also
    be expected. I emphasize this in my class. I accept your critique of my graph
    which should have been labeled "Average Historical Returns" vs. "Standard Deviation
    of Returns."

  zh: 最后，让我评论一下你关于“风险，无论如何度量，都与回报不成正比”的观点。金融理论对此没有提及。我们的理论将风险与“期望回报”联系起来，而非事后回报。要明确一点，“风险”也应该是期望的。我在课上强调了这一点。我接受你对我的图表的批评，它本该标注为“平均历史回报”与“回报的标准偏差”。
