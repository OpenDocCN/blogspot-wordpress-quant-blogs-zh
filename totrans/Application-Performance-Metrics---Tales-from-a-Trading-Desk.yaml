    has, and continues to be in many scenarios, the last to the software engineering
    party.¬† Once a team has got over the library sweet shop mentality, hopefully validate
    their proposed architecture, and ideally gone down an executable [specification](http://agilemodeling.com/essays/executableSpecifications.htm)
    road, the team often has either completely forgotten about performance, or decided

    road used from a feature perspective.¬† You can see the gaping hole üôÇ

    real-time performance that real users are experiencing as they interact with your
    application. As mentioned in the previous article, measuring the performance of
    a business transaction involves capturing the response time of a business transaction
    holistically as well as measuring the response times of its constituent tiers.
    These response times can then be compared with the baseline that best meets your
    business needs to determine normalcy.'
