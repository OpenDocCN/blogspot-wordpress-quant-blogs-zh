    Asia would more than double the expected duration of a "growth spell". Inequality
    seemed to make a big difference almost no matter what other variables were in

    not the only thing that matters but, from our analysis, it clearly belongs in

    Census Bureau suggests there has been a rise in assortative mating. Additionally,
    assortative mating affects household income inequality. In particular, ***if matching
    in 2005 between husbands and wives had been random, instead of the pattern observed
    in the data, then the Gini coefficient would have fallen from the observed 0.43
    to 0.34, so that income inequality would be smaller. Thus, assortative mating
    is important for income inequality.*** The high level of married female labor-force
    participation in 2005 is important for this result.

  zh: 作为一个投资者，我关心不平等。确实，富人在变得越来越富（国内不平等）。国内不平等之所以重要，是因为它延缓了增长的可持续性。全球化减少了全球不平等，促进了增长。
- en: As a human being, I care about inequality from a social policy viewpoint because
    it's natural to care about the society that I live in. I wrote before that what
    matters the most is the equality of opportunity and I stand by that assertion.

  zh: 作为一个普通人，我从社会政策角度关心不平等，因为关心我生活的社会是自然的。我之前写过，最重要的是机会的平等，我坚持这一点。
- en: The solutions to inequality are fairly obvious, but politically difficult to
    implement. At a global level, the effects of globalization should serve to lessen
    the inequality of opportunity. How we manage the trade-offs is another matter.
    To close the global inequality gap, Milanovic concluded that either poor countries
    have to get richer or poor people have to move to rich countries (imagine millions
    of poor people from Botswana to China flooding into America).

  zh: 不平等的解决方案相当明显，但政治上难以实施。在全球层面，全球化效应应该有助于减少机会不平等。我们如何处理权衡是另一回事。为了缩小全球不平等差距，Milanovic得出结论，要么贫穷国家变得更富有，要么贫穷的人搬到富裕国家（想象一下数百万来自博茨瓦纳到中国的穷人涌入美国）。

    reforms to reduce the entrenchment effects of inter-generational wealth transfer.

  zh: 在地方层面，它涉及到更好地获取教育资源和（是的，*叹息*)税收改革，以减少代际财富转移的固化效应。
