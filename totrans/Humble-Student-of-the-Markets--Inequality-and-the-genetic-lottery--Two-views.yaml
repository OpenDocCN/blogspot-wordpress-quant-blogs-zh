    with less equal income distributions. The effect is large. For example, we estimate
    that closing, say, half the inequality gap between Latin America and emerging
    Asia would more than double the expected duration of a "growth spell". Inequality
    seemed to make a big difference almost no matter what other variables were in
    the model or exactly how we defined a "growth spell". Inequality is of course
    not the only thing that matters but, from our analysis, it clearly belongs in
    the "pantheon" of well-established growth factors such as the quality of political
    institutions or trade openness.

    Census Bureau suggests there has been a rise in assortative mating. Additionally,
    assortative mating affects household income inequality. In particular, ***if matching
    in 2005 between husbands and wives had been random, instead of the pattern observed
    in the data, then the Gini coefficient would have fallen from the observed 0.43
    to 0.34, so that income inequality would be smaller. Thus, assortative mating
    is important for income inequality.*** The high level of married female labor-force
    participation in 2005 is important for this result.
