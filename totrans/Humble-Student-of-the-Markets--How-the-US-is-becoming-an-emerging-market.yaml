    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    stall. President Trump, otherwise known as "Dow Man", is fond of benchmarking
    his performance using the stock market. The S&P 500 (SPY) has returned an impressive
    64.5% unannualized since Inauguration. Its performance against the long bond (TLT)
    is less compelling, but it beat bonds by a total of 12.1% over the same period.

    elevated, and trades at a premium to EM VIX. ***The market is now pricing US risk
    like an emerging market.*** Market nervousness is rising, and traders will have
    to contend with a heightened risk environment until the November 3 election.
