As the major US averages grind to more new highs, I am seeing signs of confirmed upside breakouts everywhere. Consider, for example, this relative performance chart of SPY against IEF, which is the ETF for 10-year Treasuries. The ratio staged an upside breakout on the weekly chart, with relative resistance a some distance away indicating considerable upside potential for stocks.

Across the Atlantic, the FTSE 100 staged an upside breakout:

The same could be said of large cap eurozone stocks, as represented by the Euro STOXX 50:

And then there's Greece. Yes, remember that Greece? The Greece whose rating that

The European markets are healing, as the

reports even Greek companies are now tapping the bond markets for financing:

> Greek commercial refrigeration and glass bottle producer Frigoglass’s debut bond sale is the latest sign investors are growing more optimistic about Greece, the company’s chief executive said in an interview with Dow Jones Newswires Tuesday.
> 
> Frigoglass Monday sold a €250 million ($324.3 million) five-year bond–the second debt sale from a Greek company in as many weeks as the country’s corporate bond market emerges from a deep freeze.

The risk-on mood was also reflected in this

of Slovenia's successful bond financing, after Moody's downgraded the country to junk after its roadshow:

> Then the big day came – books reopened, bids were even stronger than during the first attempt and Slovenia sold 3.5bn worth of 5 and 10y bonds. On Friday, the new Sloven23s traded up by more than 4 points, which means yield fell by more than 50bp from the 6% the government paid. A fairy tale ending.

Though momentum is positive for stocks in most developed markets, it isn't necessarily all clear sailing ahead. My biggest concern is that China and China related plays look punk. Here is the Shanghai Composite in a well defined downtrend:

Industrial commodities are also exhibiting a similar downtrend pattern:

The AUDCAD currency cross, where Australia is more China sensitive and Canada more US sensitive, looks downright ugly.

pointed out that forward Street consensus earnings growth is showing signs of stalling. While this isn't a bearish signal yet, it does bear watching. Should forward estimates growth turn negative, it would create considerable headwinds for equities.

My takeaway from the current environment of powerful stock momentum is, "It's ok to get long, but don't forget to look over your shoulder and maintain a tight risk control discipline."
