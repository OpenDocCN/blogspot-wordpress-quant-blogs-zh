    strategies](http://1-2knockout.typepad.com/12_knockout/files/Seth_Klarman_MIT_Speech.pdf)
    are worth reading. He covers the credit crunch, the abuse of leverage, academic
    economists ignoring empirical evidence, and risk/return. He advocates the Buffet/Graham
    value investing philosophy.'

    [My Life as a Quant](http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471394203.html)
    at the moment. I’ll comment more on this later, but must point out how Derman’s
    comments on academic economists chime with Klarmans. While Klarman notes that
    academic economists often ignore evidence, Derman points out that the maths of
    economics is much more formal than the maths of physics textbooks – “much of it
    reads like Euclid or set theory, replete with axioms, theorems, and lemma. You
    would think that all this formality would produce precision. and yet, compared
    with physics, economics has so little explanatory or predictive power.”

    spurious authority of excessive formalism…
