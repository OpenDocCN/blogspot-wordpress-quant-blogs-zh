    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    (dotted line), though secondary uptrend support (solid line) is holding at 3640\.
    Before anyone panics, the uptrends in the S&P 500 and breadth indicators are intact.
    In all likelihood, the market is just undergoing a period of consolidation since
    the start of December.

    when you try to pour ketchup on food. Nothing happens for a long time, then it
    all happens at once. The market weakness of last week is a display of *ketchupeffekt*.
    Suddenly, all the bad news is happening at once. If this is indeed the start of
    a pullback, how bad can it get?
