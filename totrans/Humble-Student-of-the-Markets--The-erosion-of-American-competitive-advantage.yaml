- en: The main source of this difference in productivity is that U.S. workers have
    a substantially larger stock of productive capital per worker, as well as generally
    higher levels of educational attainment, which is a form of human capital. This
    relative abundance of physical and educational capital has been a driver of U.S.
    prosperity for generations. ***Neither advantage in capital, however, is intrinsic
    to American workers, and it will be impossible to prevent a long-term convergence
    of U.S. wages toward those of developing countries unless the U.S. efficiently
    allocates its resources to productive investment and educational quality.*** This
    is where our policy makers are failing us.

    physical capital, we have seen excessive malinvestment leading to bubbles in technology,
