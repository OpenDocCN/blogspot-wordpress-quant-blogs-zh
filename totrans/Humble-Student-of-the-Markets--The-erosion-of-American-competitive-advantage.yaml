- en: The main source of this difference in productivity is that U.S. workers have
    a substantially larger stock of productive capital per worker, as well as generally
    higher levels of educational attainment, which is a form of human capital. This
    relative abundance of physical and educational capital has been a driver of U.S.
    prosperity for generations. ***Neither advantage in capital, however, is intrinsic
    to American workers, and it will be impossible to prevent a long-term convergence
    of U.S. wages toward those of developing countries unless the U.S. efficiently
    allocates its resources to productive investment and educational quality.*** This
    is where our policy makers are failing us.

    physical capital, we have seen excessive malinvestment leading to bubbles in technology,
    real estate and finance over the past couple of decades. The internet and real
    estate bubbles were plain to see.
