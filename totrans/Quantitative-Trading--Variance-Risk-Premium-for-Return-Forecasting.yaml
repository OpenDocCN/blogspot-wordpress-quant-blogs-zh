    that means if VIX is high, then there is a good chance that the future return
    of the SP500 will be negative. While I have found some evidence that this is true
    when VIX is particularly elevated, say above 30, I don't know if anyone has established
    a negative correlation between VIX and future returns. (

    Premium (VRP), which is defined as the difference between a model-free implied
    volatility (of which VIX is the most famous example) and the historical volatility
    over a recent period. The relationship between VRP and future returns is examined
    in a paper by

- en: in the context of OVX, which is the CBOE Crude Oil Volatility Index. They have
    found that there is a statistically significant negative linear relationship between
    VRP and future 1-month crude oil futures (CL) returns. The historical volatility
    is computed over 5-minute returns of the most recent trading day. (Why 5 minutes?
    Apparently this is long enough to avoid the artifactual volatility induced by
    bid-ask bounce, and short enough to truly sample intraday volatility.)  If you
    believe in the prescience of options traders, it should not surprise you that
    the regression coefficient is negative (i.e. a high VRP predicts a lower future
    return).

- en: I have tested a simple trading strategy based on this linear relationship. Instead
    of using monthly returns, I use VRP to predict daily returns of CL. It is very
    similar to a mean-reverting Bollinger band strategy, except that here the "Bollinger
    bands" are constructed out of moving first and third quartiles of VRP with a 90-day
    lookback. Given that VRP is far from normally distributed, I thought it is more
    sensible to use quartiles rather than standard deviations to define the Bollinger
    bands. So we buy a front contract of CL and hold for just 1 day if VRP is below
    its moving first quartile, and short if VRP is above its moving third quartile.
    It gives a decent average annual return of 17%, but performance was poor in 2013.

- en: 'Naturally, one can try this simple trading strategy on the E-mini SP500 future
    ES also. This time, VRP is VIX minus the historical volatility of ES.  Contrary
    to folklore, I find that if we regress the future 1 day ES return against VRP,
    the regression coefficient is positive. This means that an increase of VIX relative
    to historical volatility actually predicts an increase in ES! (Does this mean
    investors are overpaying for put options on SPX for portfolio protection?) Indeed,
    the opposite trading rules from the above give positive returns: we should buy
    ES if VRP is above its moving third quartile, and short ES if VRP is below its
    moving first quartile. The annualized return is 6%, but performance in 2013 was
    also poor.'

- en: As the authors of the paper noted, whether or not VRP is a strong enough stand-alone
    predictor of returns, it is probably useful as an additional factor in a multi-factor
    model for CL and ES. If any reader know of other volatility index like VIX and
    OVX, please do share with us in the comments section!
