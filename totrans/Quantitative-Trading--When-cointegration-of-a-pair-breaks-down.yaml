    this condition can lead to profitable pairs trading. However, as every investment
    advisor could have told you, past cointegration is no guarantee of future cointegration.
    Often, cointegration for a pair breaks down for an extended period, maybe as long
    as a half a year or more. Naturally, trading this pair during this period is a
    losing proposition, but abandoning such a pair completely is also unsatisfactory,
    since cointegration often mysteriously returns after a while.

    and I not only traded it in my personal portfolio, but we traded it in our fund
    too. Unfortunately, it went haywire in 2008\. We promptly abandoned it, only to
    see the strategy recovered sharply in 2007.

    temporary, and how do we know when to resume trading a pair?'

- en: To answer the first question, it is often necessary to go beyond the technicals,
    and delve into the fundamentals of pair. Take GLD-GDX as the example. When I taught
    my pairs trading workshop in South Africa, several  portfolio managers in attendance
    told me that there are 2 reasons why gold spot price diverged from gold miners'
    stock prices. Firstly, due to the sharp increase in oil prices during the first
    half of 2008, it costs the gold miners a lot more in energy to extract the gold
    from the ground, hence the gold miners' income lags behind the rise in gold prices.
    Secondly, many gold miners hedge their exposure to fluctuating gold prices with
    derivatives. Hence when gold price rise beyond a certain limit, the gold miners
    cease to benefit from this rise. Recently, the Economist magazine published an

    by introducing oil (future) price into the cointegration equation. If you do that,
    and if you trade this triplet of GLD-GDX-USO, you will find that it is profitable
    throughout the entire period from 2006-2010\. If you find trading a triplet too
    complicated, you can at least backtest a trading filter such that you will cease
    to trade GLD-GDX whenever USO goes beyond (above, and maybe below too) a certain
    band. If you have done all these backtests, you will have a plan in place to tell
    you when to resume trading this pair. But even if you haven't done this backtest,
    and you find that you need to stop trading a pair because of cumulating losses,
    you should at least continue

    low leverage allowed, consider the single stock futures on ETF''s trading on the
    OneChicago exchange. Certainly the future on GDX is available there, while you
    might just trade the futures GC and CL directly on CME. There is, of course, the
    usual caveat that applies to futures pairs trading: the switch from contango to
    backwardation and vice versa can ruin many a pairs-trading strategy, even if the
    spot prices remain cointegrating. But that''s a story for another time.)'
