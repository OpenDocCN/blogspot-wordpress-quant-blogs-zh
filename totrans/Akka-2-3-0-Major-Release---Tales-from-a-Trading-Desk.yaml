    inspired by RxJava we are working on implementing Reactive Streams for Akka which
    will allow declarative transformation of streaming data of all kinds, with proper
    handling of back-pressure and of course fully typed.'

    in a cluster. The typical use case for this feature is when you have many stateful
    actors that together consume more resources (e.g. memory) than fit on one machine.
    You need to distribute them across several nodes in the cluster and you want to
    be able to interact with them using their logical identifier, but without having
    to care about their physical location in the cluster, which might also change
    over time. It could for example be actors representing Aggregate Roots in Domain-Driven
    Design terminology.'

    to projects.  Akka persistence is welcomed.
