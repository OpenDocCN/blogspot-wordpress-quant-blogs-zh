    my SPX pullback summary data, as I did most recently on February 26^(th) in [Updated
    SPX Pullback Summary Table for SPX 1485](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2013/02/updated-spx-pullback-summary-table-for.html),
    after the S&P 500 Index had pulled back 3.0% from a recent high.

    decline of 3.5% from Thursday’s high of SPX 1597 and today’s early session low
    of 1541, I thought it might be more instructive to update an old plot of all twenty
    pullbacks that I have catalogued since the March 2009 bottom in stocks.

    (inverted) and the x-axis records the duration of that move. At the risk of making
    the graphic somewhat of an eye chart, I have also included the peak VIX during
    the pullback as a red label for each dot. Just for fun, the long dotted black
    line is a linear fit of all the data points.

    the current pullback in blue text. Some might find it interesting to note that
    with the VIX has exceeded 19.00 in every pullback with the exception of the 17.90
    peak VIX value during the current pullback.

    but if it does, it will certainly be one of the mildest pullbacks of the 2009-2013
    bull market.
