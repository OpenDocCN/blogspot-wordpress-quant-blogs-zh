**Mid-week market update**

: My inner trader remains constructive in his bullish view for stocks, but the recent advance appears to have gotten ahead of itself. My trading models indicate a 2-4 day period of weakness, followed by continued strength into all-time highs.

In the short-term, the market is flashing cautionary signals for traders. The SPX is exhibiting negative RSI divergences as it broke out to new recovery highs. As well, the VIX Index breached its lower Bollinger Band for two consecutive days, indicating an overbought market. Historically, such conditions have led to market weakness lasting 2-4 trading days. If history is any guide, a short-term trading bottom is most likely to occur either Friday or Monday.
