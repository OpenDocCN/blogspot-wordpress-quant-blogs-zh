    Representatives](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/07/chart-of-week-intrade-and-control-of.html),
    I used an [Intrade.com](http://www.intrade.com/) contract as the [chart of the
    week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week) to
    illustrate how the markets were assigning probabilities to whether the Republicans
    would control the House of Representatives following the upcoming November 2^(nd)
    election. At the time, that contract had last traded for 55.1, which roughly translates
    to a 55.1% probability of Republican control.'

- en: Just two weeks and two days before voters go to the polls, that same contract
    is trading at 90, meaning that the markets are about 90% sure that Republicans
    will control the House following the election. Among the more critical questions
    at this juncture are how many seats the Democrats will retain in the Senate and
    just how many seats the Republicans will gain in the House. The contracts covering
    the House gains are issued in increments of five seat strikes, so that there are
    separate contracts for a gain of 50 or more seats, 55 or more, 60 or more, etc.
    Right now the most active trading can be found in the at-the-money contracts,
    with the +55 seat contract last quoted at 57.9 bid and 61.8 ask, while the +60
    seat contract last quoted at 38.1 bid and 43.8 ask.

  zh: 投票日两周零两天前，同样的合同的交易价格为90，这意味着市场认为共和党在选举后会控制众议院的可能性大约为90%。在这个阶段，更为关键的问题是如何 many

    will gain in the House. The contracts covering the House gains are issued in increments
    of five seat strikes, so that there are separate contracts for a gain of 50 or

- en: The chart below, courtesy of [Intrade](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Intrade),
    tracks the trading in the +55 seat contract for the past 90 days. Note that this
    contract crossed the 50 threshold one week ago today and last traded at 61\. Looking
    at the various contracts, prior to the contracts, the highest seat count that
    was trading over 50 was +45 seats. During the second week in October, both the
    +50 and the +55 seat contracts rose above the 50 level. With the recent heavy
    betting on the +60 seat contract and its doubling in price over the course of
    the last month, it looks as if this is the contract to watch to see how the far
    the balance of power appears to be tipping in the direction of the Republicans.

  zh: 下面的图表，来自[Intrade](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Intrade)，追踪了过去90天内+55席位的合同的交易情况。请注意，这个合同在一个星期前的今天越过了50的门槛，并且最后交易价为61。观察各种合同，在合同之前，交易超过50的最高席位数是+45席。在十月的第二周，+50和+55席位的合同都上升到了50以上。随着最近对+60席位的合同的激烈投注以及其在过去一个月内价格翻倍，看起来这个合同将是观察权力平衡向共和党倾斜程度的一个很好的指标。

    poll-by-poll perspective on the election, [RealClearPolitics.com](http://realclearpolitics.com/)
    is a great place to start. Those like me who are more interested in assigning
    probabilities to the overall outcome may prefer to keep an eye on [Intrade.com](http://www.intrade.com/),
    the popular [prediction market](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/prediction%20markets)
    site.

  zh: 正如我上次提到的，对于那些对选举的逐席、逐民调的视角感兴趣的人来说，[RealClearPolitics.com](http://realclearpolitics.com/)是一个很好的起点。像我这样更关心为整体结果分配概率的人可能会更愿意关注[Intrade.com](http://www.intrade.com/)，这个流行的[预测市场](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/prediction%20markets)网站。

    that there is a relationship between the projected Republican seat gains and the
    stock market.
