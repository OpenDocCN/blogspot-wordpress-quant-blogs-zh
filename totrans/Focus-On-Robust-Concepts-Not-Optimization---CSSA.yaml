    I can tell you one piece of important advice that will help create systems that
    will work out of sample: Focus on a concept that makes logical sense and is robust-that
    is, it has worked over long periods of time and multiple cycles and market regimes.
    Start by creating a hypothesis, and work through the logic and make some predictions
    in advance. Ideally, you should search for other research done by academics or
    practioners to build upon what has already been done.  You should also carefully
    observe the testing methodology and indicator or independent variable creation.
    Next create a test that is as simple as possible and vary the parameters to test
    for sensitivity. A robust effect in testing will have a few characteristics: 1)
    it is stable over time 2) in tends to increase or decrease in magnitude in a fairly
    stable and linear manner with the independent variable 3) the results are not
    overly sensitive when changing the parameters such as length of measurement or
    entry/exit criteria.   Pass these tests with rigorous testing, and I can virtually
    assure you that your system will be fairly durable over time as long as the effect
    persists.'

    (CDOs) and fancy derivatives. Often using this method produces systems you don’t
    fully understand, that can be so unstable to the untrained idiot, that they could
    blow up at any time. It is the most dangerous tool in existence for traders or
    researchers. The biggest error is to take a backtest that is too short, or does
    not contain multiple regimes. To make matters worse, adding several  different
    variables, “rules” or different indicators  will exacerbate the problem substantially.
    Optimization is a good tool only after at least a dozen thorough criteria have
    been met. The statistical skill required to fully benefit from optimization is
    well out of reach for most traders. Use of regression and controls are critical
    to avoid finding spurious relationships.

- en: But what really gets under my skin is the use and abuse of the concept of designing “trading
    systems.” It almost bothers me as much as when I read a newspaper article that
    mutilates the usage of statistical inference. Often I see “systems” that contain
    only 10 or 15 trades–if you have ever used any rigorous techniques or randomization
    you should know that it is easy to identify such “systems” and they are generally
    of no value whatsoever unless the edge or consistency are both ridiculously high
    (even then i wouldn’t bank on it). Idiots think systems exist in a box when in
    reality systems are just the expression of some type of theory. For example you
    may claim to have a “magic” RSI3/6 system that buys when RSI3 is below “x” and
    exits when RSI6 is above “y” with a stop loss. In reality what you are saying
    is that you believe mean reversion works, and that short term weakness forecasts
    above average market returns over a period of a week or 2 weeks. Thus what works
    specifically on your system should work in general on a variety of RSI or ideally
    other mean reversion indicators. Furthermore it should produce a consistent edge
    over that period of time (one week to two weeks).

    lose weight, but I know traders would rather use quick optimization procedures
    that can be run in seconds rather than run “mini-experiments.” Fad diets and magical
    pills will always be in style because people are inherently lazy and gullible.
    The optimist in me hopes this is not you!
