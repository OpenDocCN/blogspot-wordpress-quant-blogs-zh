    short-term strength is unusually impressive, it can create a situation where that
    extreme strength will beget more strength. When the market leaves an unfilled
    up gap that is considered a sign of strength.  When it does it 2 days in a row
    and closes at a 50-day high, that can be considered exceptional strength. That
    is what happened on Friday, and past performance is shown in the study below.

    consistent that at least some follow through was achieved in the next few days.
