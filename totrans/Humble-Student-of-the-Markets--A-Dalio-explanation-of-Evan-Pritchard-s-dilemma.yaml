    and economic cycles. Early in the game of Monopoly®, people have a lot of cash
    and few hotels, and it pays to convert cash into hotels. Those who have more hotels
    make more money. Seeing this, people tend to convert as much cash as possible
    into property in order to profit from making other players give them cash. So
    as the game progresses, more hotels are acquired, which creates more need for
    cash (to pay the bills of landing on someone else’s property with lots of hotels
    on it) at the same time as many folks have run down their cash to buy hotels.
    When they are caught needing cash, they are forced to sell their hotels at discounted
    prices. So early in the game, “property is king” and later in the game, “cash
    is king.” Those who are best at playing the game understand how to hold the right
    mix of property and cash, as this right mix changes.'

    of the bank so that it could make loans and take deposits. Players would then
    be able to borrow money to buy hotels and, rather than holding their cash idly,
    they would deposit it at the bank to earn interest, which would provide the bank
    with more money to lend. Let’s also imagine that players in this game could buy
    and sell properties from each other giving each other credit (i.e., promises to
    give money and at a later date). If Monopoly® were played this way, it would provide
    an almost perfect model for the way our economy operates. There would be more
    spending on hotels (that would be financed with promises to deliver money at a
    later date). The amount owed would quickly grow to multiples of the amount of
    money in existence, hotel prices would be higher, and the cash shortage for the
    debtors who hold hotels would become greater down the road. So, the cycles would
    become more pronounced. The bank and those who saved by depositing their money
    in it would also get into trouble when the inability to come up with needed cash
    caused withdrawals from the bank at the same time as debtors couldn’t come up
    with cash to pay the bank.

    There are three ways to deleverage. We hear a lot about austerity. In other words,
    pull in your belt, spend less, and reduce debt. But austerity causes less spending
    and, because when you spend less, somebody earns less, it causes the contraction
    to feed on itself. Austerity causes more problems. It is deflationary and it is
    negative for growth.'

    time frame or at a lower interest rate; somehow a contract is broken in a way
    that reduces debt. But debt restructurings also are deflationary and negative
    for growth. One man's debts are another man's assets, and when debts are written
    down to relieve the debtor of the burden, it has a negative effect on wealth.
    That causes credit to decline.

    you can't lower interest rates any more. Central banks create money, essentially,
    and buy the assets that put money in the system for a quantitative easing or debt
    monetization. Unlike the first two options, this is an inflationary action and
    stimulative to the economy.

    very classic. Governments have to spend more when sales and tax revenue go down
    and as unemployment and other social benefits kick in and there is a redistribution
    of wealth. That's why there is going to be more taxation on the wealthy and more
    social tension. A deleveraging is not an easy time. But when you are approaching
    balance again, that's a good thing.
