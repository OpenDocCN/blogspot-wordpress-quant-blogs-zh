    on Friday, I was please to see that a number of other bloggers picked up on the
    XLF theme and weighed in with some interesting commentary.  One post I found particularly
    noteworthy was from Bob Barnes at [bzbtrader](http://bzbtrader.blogspot.com/).  In
    his aptly titled, [Deconstructing the XLF](http://bzbtrader.blogspot.com/2008/02/deconstructing-xlf.html),
    Bob breaks down the top holdings of the [XLF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLF),
    dissects the open interest, and discusses trends in short interest as well.  (If
    you click through, don’t stop with the XLF post, as Bob does an excellent job
    with a broad range of charting and TA issues and should be required reading for
    anyone who follows the QQQQs.)

    this sector to the broader indices, like the SPX.  In the chart below, I have
    graphed a ratio of the XLF to the SPX, with a blue area chart of the SPX added
    for context.  As financials are still the largest sector component of the SPX,
    it is not surprising to see these two indices move in the same direction.  When
    the XLF and the SPX diverge, however, investors should pay close attention.  The
    divergence from May to October is notable, for instance, with the decline in the
    XLF perhaps providing a warning that the market was topping during this period.  Another
    interesting period is in early February, when the SPX rose in spite of a falling
    XLF.  Now it appears that both the SPX and XLF are moving sideways in unison.  For
    what it’s worth, I don’t expect the SPX to be able to stage a significant rally
    without dragging the XLF along for the ride or perhaps even following the financials
    back up.

    of the XLF relative to the SPX.
