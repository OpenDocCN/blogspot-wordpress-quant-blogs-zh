- en: After I penned (keyboarded?) [The Rising Popularity of XLF Options](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/02/rising-popularity-of-xlf-options.html)
    on Friday, I was please to see that a number of other bloggers picked up on the
    XLF theme and weighed in with some interesting commentary.  One post I found particularly
    noteworthy was from Bob Barnes at [bzbtrader](http://bzbtrader.blogspot.com/).  In
    his aptly titled, [Deconstructing the XLF](http://bzbtrader.blogspot.com/2008/02/deconstructing-xlf.html),
    Bob breaks down the top holdings of the [XLF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLF),
    dissects the open interest, and discusses trends in short interest as well.  (If
    you click through, don’t stop with the XLF post, as Bob does an excellent job
    with a broad range of charting and TA issues and should be required reading for
    anyone who follows the QQQQs.)

  zh: '-   在我在周五撰写[XLF期权的日益流行](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/02/rising-popularity-of-xlf-options.html)后，我很高兴看到许多其他博主也关注了XLF主题，并发表了有趣的评论。我特别注意到鲍勃·巴恩斯在[bzbtrader](http://bzbtrader.blogspot.com/)上的文章。在他的恰当标题[解构XLF](http://bzbtrader.blogspot.com/2008/02/deconstructing-xlf.html)中，鲍勃分解了[XLF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLF)的前五大持仓，分析了持仓量，并讨论了空头兴趣的趋势。（如果你点击链接，不要只停在XLF的文章上，因为鲍勃在广泛的图表和技术分析问题上做得非常好，应该是任何关注QQQQ的人的必读内容。）'
- en: Another thing to think about vis-à-vis the XLF is the relative performance of
    this sector to the broader indices, like the SPX.  In the chart below, I have
    graphed a ratio of the XLF to the SPX, with a blue area chart of the SPX added
    for context.  As financials are still the largest sector component of the SPX,
    it is not surprising to see these two indices move in the same direction.  When
    the XLF and the SPX diverge, however, investors should pay close attention.  The
    divergence from May to October is notable, for instance, with the decline in the
    XLF perhaps providing a warning that the market was topping during this period.  Another
    interesting period is in early February, when the SPX rose in spite of a falling
    XLF.  Now it appears that both the SPX and XLF are moving sideways in unison.  For
    what it’s worth, I don’t expect the SPX to be able to stage a significant rally
    without dragging the XLF along for the ride or perhaps even following the financials
    back up.

  zh: '-   关于金融股（XLF）的另一个思考点是该板块相对于标普500指数等更广泛指数的相对表现。如下图，我绘制了XLF与SPX的比率图，并在其中添加了SPX的蓝色面积图以提供上下文。由于金融股仍是标普500指数中最大的板块组成部分，看到这两个指数同向波动并不令人意外。然而，当XLF与SPX出现分歧时，投资者应该密切关注。例如，从5月到10月的分歧特别值得注意，当时XLF的下跌可能预示着市场在此期间触顶的警告。另一个有趣的时段是2月初，尽管XLF下跌，但标普500指数仍有所上升。现在看来，标普500指数和XLF正同步横向移动。无论如何，我不认为标普500指数能够在没有带动XLF一起上涨或甚至跟随金融股反弹的情况下，发起一场显著的反弹。'

    of the XLF relative to the SPX.
