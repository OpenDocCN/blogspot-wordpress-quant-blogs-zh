- en: In the good old days, when I was designing trader workstations for Goldman and
    Drexel Burnham, we use to have close interaction with the traders themselves.
    We were in an Extreme Programming mode by necessity. Traders were giving us constanmt
    feedback, and we were able to stand over their shoulders while they traded so
    we could see how they interacted with the data.

- en: Nowadays, the development staff is usually isolated from the traders... we get
    our specs from the Business Analysts. Not only that... you often get screen layouts
    from the BAs too! This often results in Windows apps that look like the old CICS
    screens... miles and miles of edit and comboboxes, modal interactions, etc. The
    traders don't mind... they are used to spending a good portion of their days in
    Excel, or they are used to the austere look of a Bloomberg terminal.

    a trader for a while. Let us see how they put a trade together. Let us try to
    make things easier for them.
