- en: Last night Johan, a frequent reader, observed that the reverse had occurred
    (NDX down over 1% while SOX was up).  He wondered what the implications of that
    might be.  It stoked my curiosity as well.  So I took a look.

- en: Moves higher have strongly outsized moves lower, but the consistency has not
    been great - just a little over 50/50\.  So I am not sure I would label this as
    "bullish", but it provides some hope for the bulls and is certainly better than
    the alternative we looked at a couple of weeks ago.
