    Netanyahu to Congress. No doubt, he will say that Iran is an existential threat
    to Israel and that the US must act with further sanctions to curtail the Iranian
    nuclear program, etc.

    In that case, what would you pay to eliminate an existential threat? Trade sanctions?
    Bombing? Covert or open warfare? Would you pay any price?'

    Iran? Does that qualify under the category of "any price"? There are lots of details
    to be worked out. I envisage a deal where Israel, perhaps with US participation,
    buys up all of the Iranian nuclear IP, research and facilities, in return for
    some sum and the lifting of trade sanctions.

    Iranian viewpoint, such a deal would achieve the stated Iranian objective of peaceful
    nuclear development and it provide a much needed boost to its economy. Moreover,
    it would most likely mean the elimination of sanctions, open Iranian oil fields
    to much needed foreign investment and open its borders to the global economy -
    and who is philosophically opposed to free and open markets?

    Iranian nuclear arms. As well, it could alleviate many of the budgetary strains

    expenditures increased dramatically after both the 1967 and 1973 wars. They reached
    a high of about 24% of GDP in the 1980s, but have since come down significantly,
    following the signing of peace agreements with Jordan and Egypt.

    and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu endorsed an additional NIS 1.5 billion for
    the defense budget to help Israel address problems regarding Iran. The budget
    changes came two months after Israel had approved its current two-year budget.
    The defense budget in 2009 stood at NIS 48.6 billion and NIS 53.2 billion for
    2010 – the highest amount in Israel's history. The figure constituted 6.3% of
    expected gross domestic product and 15.1% of the overall budget, even before the
    planned NIS 1.5 billion addition.

    to make significant cuts in the defense budget in order to pay for social programs.
    The General Staff concluded that the proposed cuts endangered the battle readiness
    of the armed forces. In 2012, Israel spent $15.2 billion on its armed forces,
    one of the highest ratios of defense spending to GDP among developed countries
    ($1,900 per person). However, Israel's spending per capita is below that of the
    USA.

    were to be taken off the table and it could reduce its defense expenditures. I
    remember reading a study done in the 1970s of the economic effects of the 1967
    and 1973 wars on Israel and the participating Arab countries. During those wars,
    the Israeli economy crashed, largely because reservists were mobilized and economic
    activity ground to a halt. By contrast, the GDP of countries like Egypt and Syria
    actually rose, because those economies were highly inefficient and state driven
    that the wars provided a Keynesian stimulus and actually boosted employment and
    productivity.

    still calls Iran a state sponsor of terrorism, but that is not an existential
    tail-risk and it can be managed. After all, ISIS is camped on the Golan Heights
    on the Israeli border and the Israeli government is managing that risk reasonably
    well.

    Many in government are still in their straitjackets about the kinds of tools that
    are available to them to solve problems. Government run solutions, like military
    ones, are not always the answer. Sometimes they should place their trust in the
    Power of the Market.
