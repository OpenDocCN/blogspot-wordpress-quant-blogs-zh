- en: In the chart below, the restraint of the Japanese yen on the Nikkei 225 is very
    evident.  Based on my most likely scenario of higher inflation leading to appreciating
    Emerging Asian currencies as they abandon the US Dollar peg, Japanese exporters
    would benefit most greatly as their competitiveness improves dramatically.  For
    your portfolio to benefit from that scenario, go long Japanese stocks, long emerging
    market currencies, long commodities, short bonds, and short Euro/Yen/US$ reserve
    currencies.  It sure would be nice if there were a fund with all these exposures,
    but for now long ujpix, long eem, long tbt, and long dba/dbc should offer a reasonable
    substitute for the retail investor.  Buy and hold might finally be a good strategy
    again with this combination.

    advice.  This suggestion could very easily lose money, and I might not notify
    you when it does, so you’re on your own.  Best of luck.
