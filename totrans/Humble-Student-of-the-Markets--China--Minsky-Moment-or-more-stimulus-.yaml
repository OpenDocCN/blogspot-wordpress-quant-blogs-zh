    growth has ended in a hard landing, from the Latin American debt crisis of the
    1980s, to Japan in 1989, East Asia in 1997, and the United States after both the
    late-1990s internet bubble and the mid-2000s housing bubble.

    almost always too good to be true. Broad-based, debt-fueled overinvestment (misallocation
    of capital) may appear to kick economic growth into overdrive for a while; but
    eventually disappointing returns and consequent selling lead to investment losses,
    defaults, and banking panics. And in the cases where foreign capital seeking strong
    growth in already highly valued assets drives the investment boom, the miracle
    often ends with capital flight and currency collapse.

    We really have no way of knowing whether the country will suffer a modest slowdown
    or a hard landing, but we both agree with George Soros that “The major uncertainty
    facing the world today is not the euro but the future direction of China.”
