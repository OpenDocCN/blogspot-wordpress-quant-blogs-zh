    What happens in the market is assumed to reflect the interplay of two things:
    1\. the decisions of countless market participants who act more or less rationally
    in their best interests, their actions collectively bringing the market toward
    a balance in which stocks, bonds, or other instruments take their realistic "fundamental"
    values (or at least something close to those values), and 2\. external shocks
    that hit the market in the form of new pieces of information concerning businesses,
    political events, changes in regulations, technological discoveries and so on.
    Without shocks from outside, these models imply, the market would settle down
    (very rapidly it is assumed) into an unchanging state. Everything that happens
    in the market, this perspective asserts, can be traced to new information perturbing
    that balance.'

    -- it is an archetype of a situation in which it is not possible for people to
    make decisions through rational deliberation, but rather have to take a more practical
    approach, forming hypotheses and theories, and learning from experience. The result
    is a dis-equilibrium situation that continues to evolve in time, never settling
    into an equilibrium. There are plenty of articles giving more detailed synopses
    of the model and how it works.

    detail through another model -- the so-called minority game. It's just the bar
    model stripped down to be as simple as possible while still preserving the essential
    element that no one in the game can "figure it out." There is no strictly rational
    way to play; intelligent play requires perpetual adaptation and learning. The
    minority game is probably the simplest mathematical model of a market in this
    sense. It is, of course, too simple to be anything more than a toy model. But
    it is, at least, a toy model looks a lot more like real markets than does the
    EMH or anything else in economics. And the benefit of its relative simplicity
    is that it is possible to see how various fundamental factors influence how it
    works, without thousands of other potential complications that obscure matters.

    would be miserable if more than 60% attended. The minority game simplifies the
    cutoff to 50%, giving symmetry to the problem -- now the people who do well on
    any week are those who act so as to be in the minority (going when most others
    stay home, and vice versa). The minority game also dispenses with the story of
    the bar. Just let each N agents on each play choose either 1 or -1, with those
    in the minority gaining some payoff (let N be odd). Now let them play many times.
    Each agent just goes along trying each time to be in the minority. How does one
    do that?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Of course, everything hinges on how we suppose the agents play. Following Arthur,
    the typical approach is to suppose that they use some kind of trial and error
    learning. The record of outcomes of the game is given by some sequence of 1s and
    -1s -- these giving the winning choices that would have been in the minority in
    each instance. For example, the last 5 outcomes might be 1,1,-1,-1,1\. A "strategy"
    in the minority game associates every such recent history with a choice of what
    to do next -- a choice of 1 or -1\. A strategy may say that IF (1,1,-1,-1,1) THEN
    choose 1, or instead IF (1,1,-1,-1,1) THEN choose -1\. If we suppose that agents
    look back to the past M outcomes in trying to forecast the future (this is often
    referred to as their "brain size"), then there are P=2

    players gets assigned a number S of these strategies at random. You can think
    of this as their intellectual inheritance. It's a collection of S different "ways
    to think" about how to predict the world. (The interesting properties of the model
    do not depend on this choice.) Agents use these strategies to play the game, and
    keep track of which strategies seem to work well, and which ones don't. This is
    generally done through some simple algorithm wherein each strategy in an agent's
    bag gains a point when it makes a good prediction, and gets docked a point if
    it predicts incorrectly. On each play, the agents look into their bag and play
    the strategy with the highest score. This is like a person mulling over the various
    theories in their head, and using the one that seems to have been most successful
    in the past.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that's it. You have a collection of agents using simple learning dynamics
    to try to predict the future based on the past. They try at each moment to choose
    what most others will not choose. Clearly no one strategy can emerge as the winner,
    because if it did and everyone started using it then they would all be in the
    majority, and all be losers. Successful strategies, therefore, sow the seeds of
    their own demise. This is what makes the game interesting. But wait -- how is
    this linked to markets?

    in which each person tries to profit by choosing the right strategy, but where
    what is "right" is determined by the collective actions of everyone together.
    There is no "right" independent of what others do. The minority game, like any
    market, is a game involving an enormous and complex ecology of interacting strategies.
    Except there is no price. A minor addition can change that, however.

- en: We get the simplest crude model of a market if we think of those choosing 1
    as "buyers"  and those choosing -1 as "sellers" of some stock. Naturally, more
    buyers than sellers drives a price up, and an imbalance the other way drives it
    down. Mathematically, you can take the change in the logarithm of the price (the
    return) at time t as being proportional to Number(buyers) - Number(sellers). The
    resulting price has a highly erratic behaviour that very roughly resembles the
    movements of financial markets. In particular, even without any external information
    hitting the market, no shocks from outside or perturbations of any kind, the price
    fluctuates up and down unpredictably merely through the perpetual evolution of
    the agents' trading strategies. One day, apparently caused by nothing, the price
    may suddenly drop by 10% -- all because many agents chose to sell just as a part
    of trying to predict what was about to happen next.

    so-called "stylized facts" of real markets -- the fat tailed statistics of return
    distributions, and the long memory and persistence of market volatility. In fact,
    the returns for this simplest minority game market are Gaussian, at least when
    the number of players is large. However, this model is only a beginning, and these
    stylized facts emerge quite naturally as soon as one includes a few more realistic
    features. For example, in this version of the game, every agent must either choose
    1 (buy) or -1 (sell) at each moment. Hence, the volume of trading is always the
    same; it is forced to be fixed, which is of course completely unnatural.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An easy way to relax this is to give the agents the ability also to abstain
    -- they might just hold what they have, neither buying or selling. This can be
    included with some measure of confidence, whereby an agent doesn't trade unless
    one of its strategies has been very successful in the recent past. This immediately
    leads to a market with fluctuations in volume, and this market does turn out to
    have stylized facts much like those of real markets, with fat tailed returns and
    long memory. Another way to allow for a fluctuating volume is to let the agents
    accrue wealth over time, and let the volume of their trading grow in proportion
    to that wealth. Again, this is an obvious step toward reality, and again leads
    to market fluctuations with many of the rich statistical features seen in real
    markets, even in such simple models.

    can be solved with some analytical techniques borrowed from physics. The details
    aren't so important, but the results show a fascinating behaviour in the market
    with a kind of phase transition separating two distinct regimes of behaviour.
    The picture that emerges gives a beautiful coarse grain understanding of markets
    as ecologies of interacting agents.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The basic story is that one key parameter in the minority game determines its
    overall character. The parameter is α=P/N, where N is the number of agents in
    the game. If this is small, then there are lots of players relative to the number
    of different market histories they can perceive. If this is big, then there are
    many different possible histories relative to only a few people. These two extremes
    lead to very different market behaviour and it's not hard to see why.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The figure below (from the Galla et al paper) shows what is effectively the
    market predictability as a function of this parameter α=P/N. In other words, this
    shows how much a past record of prices can be used to make accurate predictions
    of future prices. For large α, this predictability is positive, and it grows as
    α grows. Why? In principle, this kind of predictability ought to make for easy
    success in the game. But only if the agents' have enough flexibility in their
    behaviour to pounce on the pattern and exploit it. In this regime, it happens
    frequently that patterns emerge in the prices and yet no agent has the intellectual
    capacity to exploit it. Recall that each individual is given a random set of strategies
    to work with. With very few people in the market, that means very few strategies
    relative to the many possible market histories on which the agents make their
    decisions. In short, if the diversity of agents and their behavioural strategies
    is insufficient to let them jump on all possible patterns, the market retains
    a degree of predictability.

    oversupply of agents and strategies in play relative to the number of discernible
    histories. Now it is very likely that any predictable pattern will suit some agent's
    bag of strategies, and that agent will jump on it, profit, and their activity
    will tend to wipe out that pattern. This phase looks rather like the efficient
    market -- such a rich diversity of agents with different skills and mindsets that
    any predictable patterns are immediately washed away.

    "marginally efficient", at least much of the time. If fully efficient and hence
    unpredictable (many agents in the market, low α), then it's very hard to make
    profits in the market. This should make the market less attractive and some people
    should leave to do something else. But as the number of people falls, this pushed
    the market toward higher α and into the inefficient phase in which the market
    becomes predictable. This should in turn attract more people into the market to
    profit from easy patterns. In this simple picture, the market should tend to evolved
    toward a value of α where the predictability of prices is low but not zero, making
    it hard but not impossible to find patterns in the market. This is, judging in
    a loose non-scientific way, just about where markets often seem to be.

    get across the most basic points. It's a beautiful simple model that captures
    a great deal of the qualitative character of markets, and with further changes
    can be taken step by step toward more sophisticated models of markets. There's
    no reason to stick to idea that payoff go to those in the minority. The game has
    generalized, for example, to majority type games (where  trend following pays
    off) or mixed majority-minority games (where market reversion and trend following
    both play a role). A few steps further and you can forget the game itself and
    simply model markets as systems in which people interact with various trading
    strategies, each buying and selling, and where prices move through their collective
    action. Lots of models study a simple mixture of fundamentalists, who try to trade
    on the base of real information about stocks, and trend followers who ride the
    momentum. Computing power and imagination present the only limits.

    the minority game remains extremely important precisely because of its simplicity.
    That simplicity allows full analysis leading to the picture of two phases shown
    above. But this is already considerably more complex than market models based
    on assumed fully rational behaviour. It's crude, very much so, but a small step
    in the right direction.
