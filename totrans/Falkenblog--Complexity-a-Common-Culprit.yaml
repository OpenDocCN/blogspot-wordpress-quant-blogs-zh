    consumers. These include: Charles Morris''s "The Trillion Dollar Meltdown," which
    Mr. D''Agostini says predicted market turmoil caused by subprime mortgages and
    Wall Street greed; David Smick''s "The World is Curved," which cited the mortgage
    crisis as a early indicator of further problems ahead; George Soros''s "The New
    Paradigm for Financial Markets," which looks at past crises and their significance
    for future events; Kevin Phillips''s "Bad Money," which examines the state of
    the dollar, credit issues, and the world market, and Peter Schiff''s "Crash Proof,"
    which warned of a coming crisis and suggested how consumers could protect themselves.'

- en: They all contain an obligatory mention of greed/hubris by those who got rich
    (funny from Soros), but also the focus on finance, as opposed to real causes (eg,
    productivity growth). There is a great distrust in the complexity in finance,
    in that the connection of a mortgage, to a derivative, is often not very transparent.
    But is anything these days? Computers, cars, my thermostat, all have evolved greater
    and greater complexity, so that 'fixing them' is now beyond the average user's
    ability. In the 'good old days', things were simpler, perforce, because they were
    just starting. Complexity happens to all fields, and it would be nice if everyone
    could fix their cars like the old '57 Chevy, or fix their computer by going in
    and adjusting the autoexec.bat file, but the greater functionality of these products
    requires greater complexity to their parts, and so only full-time professionals
    can fix things that your average proficient user could fix decades ago.

    but forcing a field back to be transparent to the masses is not a solution, it
    is a stifling of productivity. Wouldn't it be great if we went back to a mathematics
    prior to non-Euclidean geometry, and calculus? Well, if your objective is to restrain
    all fields so that they be understood by your average man, I guess that would
    work. But when any field, industry, or product evolves it generally adds functionality,
    adding layers, and layers add complexity.

- en: The problem in mortgages was not derivatives, or complexity. Lowering underwriting
    standards (no downpayment, lower credit score) is pretty straightforward, and
    affected bank-owned mortgages just as much as credit default swaps. That academics,
    community activists, Clinton, Bush, Congress, regulators, Wall Street, and investors,
    did not foresee the problems in lowering credit standards for new home buyers,
    was hardly caused by derivatives up the food chain. These mortgages were going
    to blow up eventually because a vast array of special interests under the banner
    of 'increasing home ownership' was going to put more and more people into houses
    until they proved they could not afford it, by which time the seeds were sown.
    Complexity of the derivatives that referred to these instruments were second order
    in this story.
