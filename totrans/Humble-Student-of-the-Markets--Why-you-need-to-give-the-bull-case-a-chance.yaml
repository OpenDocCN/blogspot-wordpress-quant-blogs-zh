    most of the feedback and sentiment on my social media feed has tended to bear
    bearish. I saw a fair number of calls for SPX to eventually test its February
    lows at about 1820, but I haven't seen a lot of forecasts for breakouts to new
    highs. The recent year-end projection by respected former Value Line research

    up the market may be elsewhere. Back then, valuations weren’t outrageous, but
    excess in credit created unsustainable profits. This time the most obvious froth
    is in the government-bond markets. German 10-year bunds on Friday yielded a mere
    €270 a year on a €1 million investment ($1.1 million), enough to fuel your BMW
    7-Series a couple of times with enough left over for a currywurst and a beer.
    Japan’s yields are negative for bonds maturing out to early 2031, while U.S. 10-year
    Treasurys on Monday closed at a new 52-week low.

    days among financial advisors and their clients. And if you know anyone in the
    ETF business, they’ll tell you that the principal determiners of flows are in
    this order: 1) recent performance 2) whether or not advisors have been sold on
    them and 3) recent performance. ETFs do not sell themselves and retail do-it-yourselfers
    are not the drivers of AUM flows – only advisors can really move the ETF needle.
    The iShares product probably has an edge on SPLV because it’s based on an MSCI
    index, which is what many advisors use as a benchmark in their performance reporting.'

    first four months of this year, tells you everything you need to know about current
    sentiment. Advisors are tacitly accepting that they must be in US stocks, but
    because of the angst of their clients, they’re offering them exposure through
    a vehicle that purports to offer “minimum” volatility.
