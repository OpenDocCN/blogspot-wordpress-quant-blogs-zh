- en: . The CBI was devised from a system I use to trade individual (primarily S&P
    100) stocks and sometimes ETFs. I devised the system in 2005 and refer to it as
    my “Catapult” system. The Catapult was designed to take advantage of extreme (often
    capitulative) selling in these securities. The CBI reading is basically a count
    of the open Catapult triggers at any one time among S&P 100 stocks. What I noticed
    early on was that broad triggering of this system was frequently a sign that not
    only were these individual stocks primed for a bounce, but the market as a whole
    was also very likely to bounce. I have written an awful lot on the blog about
    edges that could be found by entering the market when the CBI reached certain
    levels. Traders that would like to examine any of that research more closely are
    always welcome to use

- en: In February 2008 I began the Quantifiable Edges Subscriber Letter. As part of
    the letter I included signals for my Catapult System. The success of the Catapult
    trades over the years has made it an attractive and somewhat popular feature for
    subscribers. I publish any signals that occur that night in the letter. Then using
    a limit order the next day I track them in the letter as well. When the exit signal
    occurs I also note this. The standard exit for a Catapult is at the open the day
    following the exit trigger. (On occasion I will send intraday updates alerting
    subscribers that the exit will trigger at a certain level and I am going to exit
    the trade at the close rather than waiting for the next day’s open.) While many
    subscribers have profited from the Catapult trades, there has been one common
    complaint.
  prefs: []

- en: The complaint is that since the Catapult is the one system on the site in which
    I do not reveal the entry and exit criteria it makes the trades uncomfortable
    for some traders. Not knowing when (or exactly how) the exit will come has prohibited
    some subscribers from ever entering these trades. They have instead watched many
    go by and found themselves a bit frustrated that they couldn’t take advantage
    without understanding the exit criteria. So I set about to solve this issue. Recently
    I released to subscribers the “Catapult Exit Designer” for Tradestation. The Catapult
    Exit Designer is open code that triggers entries as listed in the Subscriber letter
    over the last 4 years (over 250 trades) and allows the users to test their own
    exit criteria. It generates files for them with results of all trades. And for
    those subscribers that don’t use Tradestation, I show all the code and explain
    all the logic behind it so that you may easily transfer it to you preferred platform.
    In addition I provide sample exit strategies that would have produced results
    very similar to the actual Catapult exits.

    fills and were tracked in the letter over 72% were winners, the average trade
    made 3.35% and the profit factor has been an impressive 3.32\. What has most attracted
    me to this strategy is not just the fact that it has made money, but WHEN. Catapults
    generally trigger when the market gets scary. They happen when other systems and
    techniques I employ have sometimes struggled. So they have not only made me money,
    but they've done so when other methods were losing.  This was greatly useful in
    helping me to limit or avoid drawdowns. The timing of the trades can be seen in
    the chart below. The top of the chart shows the S&P 500\. The indicator on the
    bottom is the CBI. One way I track catapult trades is by "clusters". A cluster
    of trades begins when the CBI moves above zero and it ends when the CBI returns
    back to zero. Historically I found over 90% of clusters would have been net winners
    had you taken all the trades in the cluster with equal size. (The last cluster
    that had a net loss was about 2 ½ years ago.) Above each cluster in the chart
    is a number. That number shows the net additive gains that would've been generated
    by that particular cluster.

    an example to clarify, the latest cluster closed out in October. That cluster
    saw 8 Catapults get triggered and filled. They all were winners (not typical).
    The % gain for each was the following: 2.8%, 6.2%, 5.0%, 11.1%, 5.2%, 8.9%, 0.2%,
    and 0.3%. Add those numbers up and you get the 39.7% shown above the October cluster.
    That is what I mean by “additive gain”. It is NOT a portfolio return.)*'

    sharp selloffs when other methods may have been under stress. I’d be happy to
    show years 2008 – 2010 but this post is already way too long. If you want to see
    those results you may use the link below. They are shown there.

    years. Hopefully with the new Catapult Exit Designer more people can begin to
    take advantage of the opportunities the Catapult System identifies. If you think
    there might be some tough times in 2012 and would like to implement a method that
    can possibly take advantage of them, then the Catapult System may be one option.
    Both the Catapult System triggers and the new Exit Designer are completely included
