# Humble Student of the Markets: RIP Correction. Reflationary resurrection next?

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2016/03/rip-correction-reflationary.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2016/03/rip-correction-reflationary.html#0001-01-01)

**Explaining our market timing models**

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on research outlined in our post

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The

**Trend Model**

is an asset allocation model which applies trend following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or contraction (bearish)?"

My inner trader uses the

**trading component**

of the Trend Model seeks to answer the question, "Is the trend getting better (bullish) or worse (bearish)?" The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. Past trading of this model has shown turnover rates of about 200% per month.

The signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Buy equities*
*   Trend Model signal: Neutral*
*   Trading model: Bullish*

*

*The performance chart and model readings have been delayed by a week out of respect to our paying subscribers.* **Update schedule**

: I generally update model readings on my

 on weekends and tweet any changes during the week at @humblestudent. Subscribers will also receive email notices of any changes in my trading portfolio.

**Looking past the recession scare**

Throughout the most recent period stock market weakness, I steadfastly maintained that the market was just undergoing a corrective period and recessionary fears were overblown (see

[Why this is a correction and not a bear market](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/10/why-this-is-a-correction-and-not-a-bear-market/)

 published January 17, 2016). Now that signs of economic growth are returning and the SPX has rallied above its 50 day moving average (dma) and stayed there for a week, it`s time to move beyond the angst of a possible bear market and look forward to what`s in store for the rest of 2016.
