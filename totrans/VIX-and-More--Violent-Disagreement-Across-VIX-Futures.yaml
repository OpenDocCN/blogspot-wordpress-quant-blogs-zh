    in 2012: for the first time in their history, the VIX futures persist in being
    in violent disagreement with each other. Prior to 2012, for instance, the average
    difference between the front month and seventh month VIX futures was about 16%.
    This year that number has surged to more than 38%.'

- en: The VIX futures [term structure](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/term%20structure)
    has been in extreme [contango](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/contango)
    (back months higher than front months) for the better part of 2012, with 17 days
    in which the contango across the full VIX futures curve has exceeded the all-time
    record that stood prior to 2012\. It is almost as if the idea of a flat VIX futures
    term structure curve is passé and traders are convinced that the short-term volatility
    picture is perpetually an aberration that bears little resemblance to longer-term
    volatility expectations. Can these two differing perspectives of the future of
    volatility meaningfully coexist? If not, which view is likely to be wrong?

    in disarray under the microscope and discuss issues such as the huge gap between
    [implied volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/implied%20volatility)
    and [realized volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/historical%20volatility),
    [disaster imprinting](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/disaster%20imprinting)
    and the role of the recent financial crisis in shaping future volatility expectations,
    looming issues such as the [European sovereign debt crisis](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/European%20sovereign%20debt%20crisis),
    the [fiscal cliff](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/fiscal%20cliff),
    the potential for a hard landing in [China](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/China),
    etc.

    futures should be trading at levels that are 45-90% higher than the front month
    VIX futures, as has been the case for the past two months. I will also look at
    some of the implications for trading VIX futures, [VIX options](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20options)
    and [VIX exchange-traded products](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20ETN).
