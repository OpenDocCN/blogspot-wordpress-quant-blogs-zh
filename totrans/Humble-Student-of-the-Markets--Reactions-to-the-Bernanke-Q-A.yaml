- en: While indicators of spending and production have, on balance, been encouraging,
    the job market has improved only slowly. Following the loss of about 8-1/2 million
    jobs in 2008 and 2009, private-sector employment showed gains in 2010\. However,
    these gains were barely sufficient to accommodate the inflow of recent graduates
    and other new entrants to the labor force and, therefore, not enough to significantly
    reduce the overall unemployment rate. Recent data do provide some grounds for
    optimism on the employment front; for example, initial claims for unemployment
    insurance have generally been trending down, and indicators of job openings and
    firms' hiring plans have improved. Even so, with output growth likely to be moderate
    for awhile and with employers reportedly still reluctant to add to their payrolls,
    it will be several years before the unemployment rate has returned to a more normal
    level. ***Until we see a sustained period of stronger job creation, we cannot
    consider the recovery to be truly established***.

    highly visible prices, notably for gasoline. Indeed, prices of many commodities
    have risen lately, largely as a result of the very strong demand from fast-growing
    emerging market economies, coupled, in some cases, with constraints on supply.
    ***Nevertheless, overall inflation remains quite low...***

    low and job creation is weak. In other words, get ready for QE3.
