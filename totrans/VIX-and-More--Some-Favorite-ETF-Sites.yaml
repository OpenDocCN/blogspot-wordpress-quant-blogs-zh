- en: Since last week’s [mention](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/03/etfreplaycom-brings-etfs-volatility-and.html)
    of [ETFreplay.com](http://etfreplay.com/) as one of my favorite up-and-coming
    ETF sites, a couple of readers have inquired about my other favorite ETF sites.

    come to mind. Keeping in mind that these lists are highly subjective, my favorite
    source for information and analysis of ETFs is probably [ETFdb.com](http://etfdb.com/),
    where Michael Johnston and others cover the breaking stories, but more importantly
    offer up some finely crafted analysis of various ETFs and some of the issues surrounding
    these securities. The second site is [ETF Rewind](http://etfrewind.blogspot.com/),
    which I discussed in [Some Approaches to Trading ETFs](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/12/some-approaches-to-trading-etfs.html).
    I rarely bother with subscription services, but I find the Excel-based data and
    analytics packed into Jeff Pietsch’s ETF Rewind Pro to be indispensible.

    tool, the incremental value added for each ETF web site starts to diminish. Gary
    Gordon at [ETFExpert.com](http://www.etfexpert.com/etf_expert/) provides some
    valuable commentary and does a good job of linking to other ETF-related content
    around the web. If you like ETFreplay.com, you should also check out [ETFScreen.com](http://www.etfscreen.com/index.php).
    In addition to the screening tools, there is also an excellent set of performance
    data, some trend information derived from relative strength analysis and an ability
    to build a correlation matrix for any group of ETFs.

- en: For a different way of analyzing ETFs, try Arthur Hill’s [ETFInvestmentOutlook.com](http://www.etfinvestmentoutlook.com/),
    which focuses on the breadth and volume of each ETFs component. This site incorporates
    McClellan oscillator and summation index data, McClellan volume oscillator analysis,
    advance-decline volume, high-low analysis and related breadth tools to come up
    with a bottoms-up approach to evaluating ETFs strength and weakness.

    that has a solid screener and set of performance data. Not surprisingly, their
    profiles of the ETFs are among the most comprehensive on the web. The Wall Street
    Journal’s [ETF Research](http://online.wsj.com/public/page/etfresearch.html) center
    is also a good source for similar information.

- en: Two other sites on the periphery of the ETF universe are [CEFA.com](http://www.cefa.com/Default.aspx),
    home of the Closed-End Fund Association and an excellent source for closed-end
    fund information; and Roger Nusbaum’s [Random Roger blog](http://randomroger.blogspot.com/),
    where the not-so-random one frequently, but not exclusively, opines about ETFs
    and related subjects.
