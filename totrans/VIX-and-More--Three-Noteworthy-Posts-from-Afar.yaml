- en: Earlier this morning, [Macro Man](http://macro-man.blogspot.com/) (whose intellectual
    domain spans well beyond the macro) was ruminating on what a convergence of thinking
    about the VIX, the credit markets, and the US consumer might mean in terms of
    the future direction of the markets in a post aptly titled [Fear and Greed](http://macro-man.blogspot.com/2007/11/fear-and-greed.html).  For
    the record, I have commented on the correlation between the SPX and the VIX on
    [a number of occasions](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SPX-VIX%20correlation)
    and have pointed out that a [high positive correlation](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/05/high-positive-correlation-between-vix.html)
    is more likely to foretell a bearish move than a high negative correlation.

- en: 'Adam at [Daily Options Report](http://adamsoptions.blogspot.com/) (as much
    as he posts, when does he have time to trade?) anticipated some of this yesterday
    in [VIX Going Forward](http://adamsoptions.blogspot.com/2007/11/vix-going-forward.html),
    in which he discusses the Holiday Effect and the tendency of traders to lower
    bids in order to better match the short trading week to the seven day calendar
    week used to price options.  His Holiday Effect forecast: “volatility numbers
    on the board this week may be misleadingly low.”  Bingo!'

    宾果！
- en: 'Getting a little farther afield, over the weekend, Brett Steenbarger at [TraderFeed](http://traderfeed.blogspot.com/)
    posted some very interesting research and analysis in [Herding Behavior in the
    Stock Market:  A Look at Volume Concentration](http://traderfeed.blogspot.com/2007/11/herding-behavior-in-stock-market-look.html).  Frankly,
    this may be the most interesting stock market post I have read all year; rather
    than attempt to summarize his thinking, I am going to recommend that you click
    over and read his post in the original, as well as a related subsequent post,
    [Herding Sentiment in the Stock Market and Prospective Index Returns](http://traderfeed.blogspot.com/2007/11/herding-sentiment-in-stock-market-and.html).  In
    between turkey (ham?) sandwiches, I will certainly be thinking about market sentiment,
    volatility, and herding over the next few days.'

  zh: 再远一点，周末，布雷特·斯蒂恩巴格在[交易者饲料](http://traderfeed.blogspot.com/)上发布了一些非常有趣的研究和分析，标题为[股市中的羊群行为：成交量集中度的观察](http://traderfeed.blogspot.com/2007/11/herding-behavior-in-stock-market-look.html)。坦率地说，这可能是我今年读过的最有趣的股市帖子；我就不试图概述他的想法了，我建议你点击阅读他的原文以及相关后续帖子[股市中的羊群情绪与预期指数回报](http://traderfeed.blogspot.com/2007/11/herding-sentiment-in-stock-market-and.html)。在吃火鸡（火腿？）三明治之间，我当然会思考市场情绪、波动性和羊群行为。
