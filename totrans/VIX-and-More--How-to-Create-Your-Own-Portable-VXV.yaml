- en: I recently received a question from a reader who was looking to create a homemade
    version of the [VXV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXV) that he
    could apply to the Nifty (formally known as the [S&P CNX Nifty](http://www.nseindia.com/content/indices/ind_nifty.htm)),
    which is an index of 50 large capitalization companies on the [National Stock
    Exchange of India](http://www.nseindia.com/homepage.htm). Specifically, the reader
    wanted to know if it would be possible to use a 93 day moving average of the [India
    VIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/India%20VIX) to create an index
    that would be analogous to the VXV.

- en: Actually, VXV ignores all historical volatility readings and utilizes implied
    volatility instead. It is the blending of implied volatility for the options from
    the months that are closest to 93 days into the future.

- en: Refer to the graphic below and I will create a “quick and dirty” version of
    VXV that can be used on any underlying that has options. The example here is for
    the SPX, but the same process can yield a VXV proxy for any underlying.

- en: Determine the two options expiration months whose time to expiration is closest
    to 93 days (the term for the VXV). In this case we are using July, with 85 days
    until expiration and August, with 120 days until expiration. Of course once each
    month there will be one month with exactly 93 days until expiration.

    the last close for each of the two months. Here the last close is 843.55\. For
    July, the series for the calculations are 840 and 850\. For August, we use 825
    and 850.

    relevant series for each of the two months. These are highlighted in red in the
    optionsXpress graphic below.

    (A), July puts (B), August calls (C) and August puts (D). In this case the interpolation
    is done by assuming the proportions for the SPX close are the same as they are
    for the implied volatility values. For example:'

- en: Now that we have implied volatility levels for the SPX close, we need to average
    these across both puts and calls for each month. July = (A + B) / 2 and August
    = (C + D) / 2

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Finally, interpolate the July and August results from the step above to estimate
    93 day implied volatility. The easiest way to do this is to start with the nearer
    month and then add the appropriate fractional portion of the later month that
    lifts the blended average to 93\. The approach is analogous to the interpolation
    above and yields and equation that looks like this:'

- en: VXV = [(A + B) / 2] + [(93-85)/(120-85) * ((C + D) / 2) – ((A + B) / 2)]

    and is detailed in the [CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index Description](http://www.cboe.com/micro/vxv/3monthvix.pdf).
    This quick and dirty variant can be calculated quickly and is portable across
    any underlying with options, including the Nifty.
