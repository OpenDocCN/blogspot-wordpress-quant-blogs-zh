    to use the GARCH model for that. But like most things we learned in school, we
    don''t necessarily expect them to be useful in practice, or to work well out-of-sample.
    (When was the last time you need to use calculus in your job?) But out of curiosity,
    I did a quick investigation of its power on predicting the volatility of SPY daily
    close-to-close returns. I estimated the parameters of a GARCH model on training
    data from December 21, 2005 to December 5, 2011 using Matlab''s Econometric toolbox,
    and tested how often the sign of the predicted 1-day change in volatility agree
    with reality on the test set from December 6, 2011 to November 25, 2015\. (One-day
    change in realized volatility is defined as the change in the absolute value of
    the 1-day return.) A pleasant surprise: the agreement is 58% of the days.'

    we should prepare to retire in luxury. Volatility is easier to predict than signed
    returns, as every finance student has also been taught. But what good is a good
    volatility prediction? Would that be useful to options traders, who can trade
    implied volatilities instead of directional returns? The answer is yes, realized
    volatility prediction is useful for implied volatility prediction, but not in
    the way you would expect.

    of us would instinctively go out and buy ourselves some options (i.e. implied
    volatility). In the case of SPY, we would probably go buy some VXX. But that would
    be a terrible mistake. Remember that the volatility we predicted is an unsigned
    return: a prediction of increased volatility may mean a very bullish day tomorrow.
    A high positive return in SPY is usually accompanied by a steep drop in VXX. In
    other words, an increase in realized volatility is usually accompanied by a decrease
    in implied volatility in this case. But what is really strange is that this anti-correlation
    between change in realized volatility and change in implied volatility also holds
    when the return is negative (57% of the days with negative returns). A'

    volatility or VXX, inducing positive correlation. But on average, an increase
    in realized volatility due to negative returns is still accompanied by a decrease
    in implied volatility.

    tomorrow, you should short VXX instead.
