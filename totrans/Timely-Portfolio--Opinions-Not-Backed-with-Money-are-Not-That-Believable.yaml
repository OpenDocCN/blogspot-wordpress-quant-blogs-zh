    money would flow visibly in that direction.  [Reuven Brenner](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=2&sqi=2&ved=0CCkQFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fpeople.mcgill.ca%2Freuven.brenner%2F&ei=AtoDTdCzPIL68AaHkN3oAg&usg=AFQjCNEuEABpeGQTvMWHn65c3m2UEiNx7A&sig2=72tzgAtmCJeMjFpdsSwQWg

    entertainment,  overconfidence, rational action given competent assessment of
    probability, and desperation or relative underperformance.

    prevails primarily when the stakes are low.

    of supposedly strong bullishness all very readily apply.  However, analysis of
    a chart that I have surprisingly not seen in the press, reveals an interesting
    result.  Mutual fund flows as measured by [ICI](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CBoQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ici.org%2F&ei=6eADTa-EGYOBlAfowcmuDg&usg=AFQjCNHp-bkB5qtA4VrXR6oCgdo_7jq_Tw&sig2=Mb8QzLDFXlWir56i5jOCkA
    "ICI") show an exodus from equities precipitated by the financial panic of 2007-2008
    but extended throughout the supposedly “bubble bull market” since March 2009 driven
    by lingering effects of fear due to the severity of the crisis.  When we compare
    the 2009-current period to the most recent bull markets of 1987 (start of the
    ICI series)-2000 and 2003-2007, equity mutual fund flows are markedly different
    and do not exhibit any real correlation to the often cited sentiment survey of
    the [AAII- The American Association of Individual Investors](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=1&sqi=2&ved=0CBsQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Faaii.com%2F&ei=BOIDTZq_H8OB8gbe36TrAg&usg=AFQjCNH43QiLqrZG9YBv_pvV1H-0qBeJoQ&sig2=Vdg0bSGYfr3vuS7SyBVw5w
    "AAII- The American Association of Individual Investors").  The survey displays
    varying degrees of bullishness and bearishness, but opinion has not affected the
    outflow from equity mutual funds.  Whether the bullishness is justified by overconfidence
    or rational assessment of probability, it has not been strong enough to convince
    investors to pursue a potential opportunity to improve wealth.

    of desperation has not driven money to opportunity, then fear dominates. If fear
    dominates, then opportunity will be squandered, and the increasing, but already
    record income/wealth disparity in the United States and dramatic underperformance
    of everyone’s savings disproportionately invested in bonds will incite even more
    desperation.  Eventually if for some reason 2 and 3 do not kick in first, this
    desperation will become so severe that it will force investors to take risk. 
    Its exact manifestation is unknown, but it will appear somewhere other than bonds. 
    Overconfident and desperate risk-taking causes bubbles and since we have not seen
    any real risk-taking, no bubbles currently exist in stocks.
