- en: The thing you see above is a plant called Amaranth (this is Palmer Amaranth,
    one of many species). It's a superweed -- resistant to the ubiquitous and powerful
    herbicide Round Up -- and in many parts of the US an immense pain to farmers growing
    corn, soybean or cotton. They're spending millions to keep it from spreading in
    their fields, and not being too successful.

    It's been eaten for thousands of years around the world. Now farmers are trying
    to eradicate it in many cases so they can keep producing the cheap high-fructose
    corn syrup on which the soda and fast food and processed food industry depends.
    The very fuel of widespread obesity.
