- en: Weekly biodiesel prices in Iowa are available in the [National Weekly Ag Energy
    Round-Up](http://www.ams.usda.gov/mnreports/lswagenergy.pdf "National Weekly Ag
    Energy Round-Up") report released every Friday by the The Agricultural Marketing
    Service (AMS/USDA). This report is published in **pdf** format while we recently
    parsed **html **with [Python and BeautifulSoup](https://quantcorner.wordpress.com/2014/03/05/scraping-data-from-the-internet-with-python-and-beautifulsoup/
    "Scraping data from the internet with Python and BeautifulSoup").

    "PDFMiner") library. It gets through a certain number AMS’s online pdf files and
    extracts the data desired.

    error handling mechanism so that the program goes on whatever happens. In fact,
    there shall be Fridays when the weekly report in question was not released eg
    due to  banking holidays, some reports of the US agriculture agency are missing
    due to last November’s partial US Government shutdown, … . Other possible error
    types would also be ignored and NAs would be output instead.
