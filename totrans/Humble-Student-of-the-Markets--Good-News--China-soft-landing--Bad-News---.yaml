    monetary policy, which served to coddle the State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) at
    the expense of the Small and Medium Enterprises and the household sector. Not
    so coincidentally, Party cadres and insiders have made out like bandits as the
    power of SOEs have grown. While the central government's stated policy is to re-balance
    growth away from big ticket infrastructure spending toward household spending,
    such a policy is unlikely to get implemented because it gores the Party insiders'
    ox.

    China's leadership is likely to panic and implement another round of stimulus
    which would lead to another round of unbalanced infrastructure induced growth,
    despite its stated policy of trying to re-balance growth toward the household
    sector.
