- en: . The basic idea for these is, instead of investing in 'high' and 'low' beta
    stocks, target a direct beta of say 1.0, or 1.5\. This avoids the variability
    in the beta deciles, which as any good investor knows, goes up during expansions,
    and compresses as correlations rise during bear markets.

    minimizing benchmark risk. By using only stocks with market caps above $500MM,
    and then choosing 100 stocks with historical betas closest to 1.0, the prospective
    beta is near one. That is, you grap this middle section. This gives you the benefit
    sf trivial benchmark risk, but by avoiding the super high beta stocks that are
    part sf the index, you add a couple percent to you return:'

- en: The beta1.0 portfolio was up 30%, vs 14% for the S&P500\. How did this happen?
    Mainly because the beta1.0 portfolio drew from all stocks over $500MM, and so
    reaped the benefit of the small cap boom in 2010\.

    stocks. It trounced the S&P500 and Russell 1000 last year (25% for RTY vs. 13ish%
    for SPY and RIY), primarily because of the rise in the second half of the year.
    Using data since 1962, the beta1.0 portfolio outperforms about about 2% annually,
    slightly higher volatility (~3% annualized), and a beta around 1.0 (hence the
    name).
