- en: A straddle is an option trading strategy that involves buying a put and a call
    at the same strike. If the underlying goes up, the call is profitable. If it goes
    down the put is profitable. If there’s little price movement the premiums likely
    constitute a loss.

- en: A swaption straddle is a payer swaption together with a receiver swaption. If
    floating rates go up, you chose to pay fixed. And if floating rates go down you
    chose to receive fixed. And if rates don’t move, game over !  Would you like to
    play again ?
