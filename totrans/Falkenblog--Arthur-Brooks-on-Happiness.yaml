    you ask someone if they feel like they are creating such value, they are happy,
    regardless of how much they make. Giving people money, via welfare or inheritance,
    does not make people happy, because this if anything discourages the effort needed
    to find and develop such a niche.

    you can only get good at something via a lot of effort, and if the task is perceived
    as onerous or boring you won't put in enough effort; if you are good at it, you'll
    find you like the appreciation you receive from others that is greater than in
    any other activity. Thus, finding your alpha is like Brook's 'perceived earned
    success'. If you find what you would do for nothing and get so good people pay
    you for it, you will probably be happy.

    current and permanent value: Pets.com vs. Google, the works of John Kenneth Galbraith
    vs. Ludwig von Mises. They might, at one time, have generated the same appreciation,
    but one faded, the other proved highly prescient. One''s sense of whether one
    is creating permanent value, irrespective of current rewards, is important as
    well, because its rather ghastly to think one''s lifework will be seen like past
    experts in quack homeopathy, irrelevant if not a joke.'

    This makes sense because kids learn that people are differently skilled, and one
    wants the best person acting as quarterback, lead violin, or head writer, because
    that helps them be more successful in their goals as wide receiver, lead flute,
    or lead actor; to reward people the same is to be counterproductive and unjust.
    Free markets are fair in the sense that they most closely allocate rewards according
    to this ideal, and Brooks finds that those who think the market is generally fair
    believe in markets, and those who think the market is a rigged game, believe in
    greater government control. It comes down to the belief as to whether a market
    is fairer than feasible alternatives, better at rewarding value, implementing
    justice.

- en: Most likely your destiny is not to be famous or rich, but rather, a dependable,
    valued, programmer for a company that makes paper. Or perhaps your best talent
    will never be exploited because of a large opportunity cost. Further, the work
    sphere of your life complements but does replace the personal side, where friends
    and family appreciate very different skills. The key is doing the best with what
    you can, the self-awareness and motivation to develop one's strengths so that
    your hard work generates a maximum payoff going forward. As Muhammad Ali once
    said, "You can be the best garbage man or you can be the best model--it doesnt
    matter as long as you're the best." 'The best' is mathematically improbable, 'really
    good' generates the same result. If you are really good at your job your day is
    filled with sincere gratitude by colleagues and customers, and hopefully you can
    also have a family that appreciates you as well (but for vary different reasons).

- en: In the end Marcus Aurelius notes that popularity counts for nothing, "we're
    all forgotten. The abyss of endless time that swallows it all. The emptiness of
    those applauding hands." So, live for creating value in the lives of those around
    you, value that is appreciated and will be missed because it is real. If you create
    real value, things that with the passage of time retain their admiration, as Brooks
    suggests, that will probably make you happy, which isn't nothing.

  zh: 最后，马库斯·奥勒留指出，受欢迎度毫无意义，“我们都会被遗忘。无尽时间的深渊将一切吞噬。那些鼓掌的双手的空虚。”因此，活着就是为了为周围人的生活创造价值，这种价值是被赞赏的，因为它是真实的。如果你创造了真正的价值，随着时间的流逝仍然受到人们的钦佩，就像布鲁克斯所建议的那样，那可能会使你幸福，这不是无关紧要的事情。
