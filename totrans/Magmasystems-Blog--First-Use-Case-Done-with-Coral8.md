# Magmasystems Blog: First Use Case Done with Coral8

> 来源：[http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2007/11/first-use-case-done-with-coral8.html#0001-01-01](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2007/11/first-use-case-done-with-coral8.html#0001-01-01)

I now have Coral8 detecting when a sector has abnormal activity, and I have a Coral8 Output Stream publishing into a .NET application for visualization. If I want to, I can take the data from the Coral8 alert, transform it into a JMS message, and publish it out on the Tibco EMS bus for other applications in the organization to consume. Or, I can publish it out to another Coral8 stream.

Well done, Coral8 team!

Now, it's on to the Aleri evaluation. The good people at Aleri's sales engineering team have done most of this first use case, but now that I am armed with more Coral8 knowledge, I need to try to rebuild the Aleri use case from scratch by myself.
