    estimate is –2.1%, far below its long-run level of about 2.1%.*** The fall in
    the natural rate during the recession is explained by low expected productivity
    growth. With projected low growth, the economy would need less saving and more
    spending to use resources fully, hence the lower natural rate of interest. During
    the economic recovery, the natural rate was kept low by weak demand due to a larger
    propensity to save in the aftermath of the financial crisis.

    below its long-run level for some time. This implies that low interest rates over
    the next few years are consistent with the most efficient use of resources and
    stable inflation. The analysis also finds that the output gap is expected to remain
    negative even after the natural rate is close to its long-run level. Additionally,
    there is considerable uncertainty about both the short-run dynamics as well as
    what level should be expected in the longer run. All these considerations reinforce
    the possibility that interest rate normalization will be very gradual.

    Several readers have voiced concerns about how small caps have lagged during this

    in 2009 and 2011, but they initially tanked, on a relative basis, in 2013 but

    the more commonly used NYSI in the bottom panel. I have also overlaid a stochastic
    on the former indicator. Currently, the stochastic shows that this indicator is
    overbought, but the record on past overbought conditions has been mixed. The Summation
    Index became overbought in 2009 but did not pause; it became overbought in 2011
    and did pause and consolidate; but this index did not even get overbought in 2013\.
    One theme that did show up in all of this analysis is that breadth continued to
    trend upwards after ZBTs, which is better shown in NYSI (bottom panel), though
    that condition was also evident in the common stock only Summation Index as well.
