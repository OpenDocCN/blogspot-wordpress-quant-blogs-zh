    on April 26, 2011, some eleven months ago.

- en: From a long-term perspective, not much has happened with the VIX, but for those
    who have ridden the volatility roller coaster up and down, the present time seems
    like an excellent opportunity to reflect on where the ride has taken us.

    (ETP) during the last eleven months, the ride has been much different than that
    of the VIX itself, an issue I highlighted in [VIX Exchange-Traded Products: The
    Year in Review, 2011](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2011/12/vix-exchange-traded-products-year-in.html),
    when I concluded, “While it is interesting that both the long and short volatility
    ETPs were unable to turn a profit for the year, there were stretches during 2011
    that various VIX ETPs produced extraordinary gains.”'

    ETPs that are the most actively traded issues among the several that occupy a
    competitive space with a similar leverage factor and weighted average maturity

    the worst losses being incurred by VXX, which was down 28% during this period.

    ZIV) were considerably less volatile than their one-month target maturity counterparts.

- en: There are a number of potential takeaways here, but perhaps the biggest of these
    is that VIX ETPs will struggle to outperform the VIX over longer-term time horizons.
    For these trades to be profitable, proper market timing is of the essence, as
    is the ability to take profits and/or cut losses when the trade starts to move
    sharply in the wrong direction.
