- en: Which would you rather do? Work for a big Wall Street Investment bank, be guaranteed
    a good salary and (in good times), a decent bonus that might make you the envy
    of your neighborhood (unless you live in Short Hills, NJ or Greenwich, Ct), or
    work for a small, technically-savvy software company where you can be directly
    responsible for the bottom line?

    IB that I work for.
  prefs: []

- en: T is one of the top performance architects on Wall Street, and has personally
    been instrumental at improving the performance of several of our key systems.
    For various reasons, T felt that he wanted to explore some other opportunities,
    and within a few weeks, he had a few job and consulting offers. The fact that
    he could be so successful in his job search in this kind of market speaks volumes
    about his talent.

- en: The position that T was going to accept was as a W-2 consultant with another
    large investment bank whose troubles have been in the news lately. T had never
    consulted before, so he had asked me a lot of questions about what it was like
    to be a consultant. Between the fact that T was new to consulting, only had a
    one-year contract, and was involved with an Investment Bank whose management was
    said to be a bit befuldled, I preferred to see T end up in another place. If this
    Investment Bank were to lay off additional consulting staff in the future, T would
    probably be one of the first ones to go. The Investment bank would have probably
    given T a small chunk of money to buy off the rest of the contract, and then T
    would have found himself back out on the street.

    the Complex Event Processing vendors contacted me to ask me if I knew anyone who
    would be available for a new position that his company had opened. Immediately,
    I thought of T. He was on his way out the door anyway, so I felt OK about referring
    him to the CEP vendor. Within two days, T had a third offer, and after another
    day, T inked the deal with the CEP vendor!

- en: I spent quite a bit of time with T to help him through his array of choices.
    Almost every decision point favored joining the CEP vendor. The CEP vendor is
    certainly not a start-up, as they have been around for a few years and have about
    60 people working for them, but it certainly has the feel of a start-up (sans
    the foozball table and loft in Silicon Alley).
