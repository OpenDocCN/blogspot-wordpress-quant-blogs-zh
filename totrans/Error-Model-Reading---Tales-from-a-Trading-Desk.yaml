- en: It’s taken me a while to get round to reading Joe Duffy’s Error Model [article](http://joeduffyblog.com/2016/02/07/the-error-model/)
    – mainly due to the length of the article 🙂  However, like most things Joe write,
    its full of useful information.

    the reminder of the article.  A number of people could learn a lot from Joe’s
    writing style and format.  Context is key.

     Also, the “Let it crash” and Netflix’s Chaos Monkey references 🙂 in the Reliability,
    Fault-tolerance, and Isolation section 🙂

    of Microsoft

    we quickly moved away to vanilla C# and had to rediscover what we wanted. We ultimately
    ended up in a very different place after living with the model for years.

    and Conclusions 🙂  Microsoft Edge took advantage of abandonment in a few areas
    based on the Midori work, coupled with consideration to bring contracts to C++.
