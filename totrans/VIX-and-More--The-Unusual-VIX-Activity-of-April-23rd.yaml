    on the unusual action in the VIX on Monday, April 23^(rd) in which the VIX was
    up 8% while the SPX was down only 0.2%.  If you follow the link above, you can
    see that my relatively unconsidered response pointed at three potential factors
    which might have had a larger effect on the VIX than the SPX.'

    minor elaborations.  The one additional factor that looms much larger in retrospect
    is the fear associated with the [real estate market crashing in Spain](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601085&sid=a3CkVkudjbZ0&refer=europe),
    as well as potential spillover into the banking sector and into other geographies.  I
    wish I had a better explanation, but I don’t.  I am posting my thoughts here in
    hopes that some readers can weigh in with their theories.

    calendar week" in which trading and calendar time is synchronized during the trading
    week, but becomes uncoupled on weekends and holidays.  On Monday, time is re-synchronized
    and volatility spikes to mark the event.

    you to [A Tale of Two Indices](http://www.math.nyu.edu/research/carrp/papers/pdf/vixov_bloomberg.pdf)
    by Peter Carr and Liuren Wu, whose weekday effects analysis is on page 10.  A
    quick eyeball of the charts shows that the typical price jump from Friday to Monday
    is in the 2.0 to 2.2% range.

    that volatility usually rises the week after options expiration. I [discussed
    this phenomenon](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/01/vix-performance-during-options.html)
    early on in the life of the blog, but should return to this theme for follow-up
    at some point.

    dramatically](http://www.ivolatility.com/options.j?ticker=VIX:CBOE&R=1&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;period=12&chart=2&vct=)
    during the past two weeks and the broader markets on an impressive winning streak,
    several indicators were flashing overbought signals and the VIX looked like cheap
    portfolio insurance once again.

    calendar problem, another 2% for the 0.23% drop in the SPX (I have the VIX at
    a current beta of -8.34, so 0.23% * 8.34 ≈ 2%) and perhaps 0.5% (a SWAG) for the
    week after options expiration week and I can account for about a 4.5% spike in
    the VIX for Monday.  That leaves another 3.5% to be accounted for by Spanish real
    estate, cheap portfolio insurance and other factors.

    with more fodder for his “[error term](http://www.billakanodoodahs.com/2007/04/deconstructing-the-vix/)”
    analysis.
