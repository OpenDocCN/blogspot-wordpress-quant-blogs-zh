    the US was only one country out of many at the dawn of the 20th Century and many
    countries and political regimes have disappeared in that time frame. Instead of
    US-like asset returns, how do you know that your returns won`t look like UK returns
    like the chart below. Note that US equity returns in the above chart showed a
    cumulative return of 1248, compared to 372 for the UK.

    in the same period? What if you had been invested in (*shudder*) Russia instead,
    where your asset prices likely went to zero after the Russian Revolution?

    indeed a bet on world peace and Pax Americana. However, it was a reasonable assumption
    to make given the geopolitical outlook for the continuation of US dominance in
    global affairs. As long as we don't see any world wars, everything is going to
    be fine.

    are damaged if you get into a world war, or even worse, lose a war. While being
    on the losing side of an all-out war certainly destroys asset values - that is
    more or less an evident fact, being on the winning side can weaken an economy
    as to inhibit growth and impair asset values as well.

    (imagine if Napoleon had won at Waterloo!) and she spent the next century paying
    off that debt, aided by burgeoning growth and her overseas colonies. British debt
    rose sharply again during the 20th Century in response to World War I and, later,
    World War II.

    to go to war can significantly weaken national finances. If a country with fragile
    finances were to experience a shock, whether it be the catastrophe of losing a
    war or other blow to the economy, it would most likely greatly impair asset returns.
