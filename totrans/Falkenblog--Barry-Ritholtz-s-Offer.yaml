    I did skim his book, which I found very confused about what it means to explain
    something. He pridefully

    being Congress, so perhaps all in there are 100 groups at fault). That's not an
    explanation. A useful way of looking at the data compresses it, so you can understand
    more with less. Merely cataloging everyone important who did not anticipate an
    event that by definition was not anticipated(a decline in asset values), is pointless.

    to blame for the credit crisis?" This would be decided by "a fair jury." He is
    arguing for the negative. Anyone who thinks 'a debate' has ever settled a contentious
    issue is rather naive. I suppose most of this debate would fall under the 'what
    do you mean by significant' umbrella, where he would retreat to the meaning 'necessary
    and sufficient', which no one asserts.

    constituents. Classic politics. But then the CRA was used to gather pledges for
    lending targets, and aid to non-profits, which were then used to pay the measely
    down payments needed, and then the bank lenders (like

    and legislators encouraging these activities. The naked self-interest in this
    game, all under the pretext of helping the little guy, is pretty obvious.

    oversight. The same Boston Fed study used to rationalize greater CRA lending,
    was used to rationalize lower, even absent down payments. The one exogenous mover
    in this whole mess was the thought that increasing home ownership was good business,
    in that it lead to happier, wealthier communities. This derived from the fact
    that when people don't lend purely out of discrimination, you can rectify a moral
    wrong costlessly the way breaking the color barrier in baseball both made the
    game better, made the first movers better, and was the right thing to do.

    CRA, another vehicle for promoting a political patronage system, focused on race
    and masked as justice, would have been found. That home buyers, investors, rating
    agencies, academics, legislators (Rep and Dem), and regulators, all agreed that
    this initiative was a good idea highlights how the real common factor was the
    idea that pure, inefficient discrimination was prevalent. That's the only way
    you can change an equilibrium level of homeownership without causing a mess.
