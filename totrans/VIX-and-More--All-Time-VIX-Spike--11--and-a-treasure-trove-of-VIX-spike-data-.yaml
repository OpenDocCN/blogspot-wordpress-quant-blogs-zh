    today’s trading session stocks we largely unchanged, then some pockets selling
    began when results of the elections in [Italy](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Italy)
    started trickling in, suggesting the possibility of a deadlock in the Italian
    parliament and perhaps the need for another round of elections.

- en: The governmental chaos is largely the result of rise of two intriguing political
    figures. One of these is the phoenix known as Silvio Berlusconi and his People
    of Freedom (PDL) party, which is anti-austerity and has proposed a policy of massive
    tax cuts and talked about the possibility of leaving the [euro](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/euro).
    The bigger electoral surprise is Beppe Grillo and the Five Star Movement (M5S),
    where Grillo’s populist agenda and anti-corruption message have resonated with
    voters. Both Berlusconi and Grillo have had a much stronger influence on the elections
    than most had anticipated and with Italy’s relationship with the euro zone now
    in question, the euro fell to under 1.31 against the dollar for the first time
    in six weeks.

    threat, began selling off sharply as a result of the confusion about the future
    of the Italian government, with selling gathering steam during the second half
    of today’s session and accelerating sharply during the last hour, when the S&P
    500 index fell more than 1% and the VIX spiked 14.4%.

    spike in the VIX makes it the eleventh largest one-day spike in the 24 years of
    VIX historical data going back to 1990.

- en: The first question on everyone’s mind is what the implications of the [VIX spike](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20spikes)
    are for stock prices and volatility going forward. The truth is that the historical
    record following a large one-day VIX spike is somewhat spotty. The table below
    captures some data from the top 20 one-day VIX spikes. Note that on average (here
    is where I like to remind everyone that it is possible to drown crossing a stream
    that is one inch deep ‘on average’) stocks generally outperformed following a
    big VIX spike for up to one week (SPX ROI +1 to +5 days) and also performed well
    looking out more than two months. From one week to two months, however, stocks
    have underperformed following a large VIX spike.

    of this data for the VIX at certain absolute levels or during selected periods
    or even relative to the magnitude of the change in the SPX, it is possible to
    draw some very different conclusions. Part of the reason for this may be due to
    the sample size and part of the answer may be that a clear-cut interpretation
    of this data is not easy to extract. For these reasons, I have included a fair
    amount of relevant data and encourage readers to draw their own conclusions.
