    measures of investor anxiety and volatility, now that the VIX is down 72% from
    its high.

    question on the minds of many as of late: [Why Do VIX Futures Remain High?](http://www.condoroptions.com/index.php/market-commentary/why-do-vix-futures-remain-high/)
    He shares some graphics from his excellent *Volatility Tracker* feature and offers
    a reminder that “the reason those VIX futures remain higher is that traders are
    willing to pay for November and December SPX options at a higher implied volatility
    – so any portfolio insurance purchased now will already have this information
    priced in.”'

- en: Bradley Kay at Morningstar takes up a related question in [Is Volatility Cheap
    Yet?](http://news.morningstar.com/articlenet/article.aspx?id=301375&pgid=rss)
    He discusses [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures)
    and the [VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX) futures ETN at
    some length and offers a reminder that “these futures are also subject to the
    same dangers of [contango](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/contango)
    that hurt similar rolling near-month futures investments in United States Oil
    ([USO](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/USO)) and United States Natural
    Gas ([UNG](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/UNG)) earlier this year.”
    Kay concludes, in concert with my own thinking, that “until this contango starts
    to flatten and the spot VIX falls to levels more in line with historical norms,
    we do not think these ETNs provide an attractive long-term risk-reward trade-off.”
    I do think VXX can be traded effectively across relatively short-term time frames,
    but the contango roll risk or [term structure](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/term%20structure)
    decay should not be dismissed. I will do a deeper dive into this subject in the
    near future.

    (note the new web site) discusses the Credit Suisse Fear Barometer ([CSFB](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/CSFB))
    in [About that CSFB Index](http://dailyoptionsreport.com/blog/post/about-that-csfb-index/)
    and comes down in favor of a modification proposed by Ryan Renicker of [New Edge
    Group](http://www.newedgegroup.com/web/guest/home). I need to put my hands on
    a full set of historical data before drawing any meaningful conclusions about
    the CSFB, but I like the logic and construction behind a fear-based index denominated
    in cost of collar data. From what I have seen of the CSFB charts, however, I will
    approach this one with a fair degree of skepticism.
