    [Think investment policy first, not just NFP](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2013/09/think-investment-policy-first-not-just.html))
    that I was a big fan of using an asset-liability management framework for pension
    plans and foundations. After all, the liability framework defines your objectives.
    If you don''t know your objectives, how can you know if you are succeeding?'

    have the luxury of being patient. The main determinant of returns is the asset
    mix (see belief #6). In a steady state where the fund isn''t being liquidated,
    they can wait out the sub-par equity market returns, which can last for decades.
    Individuals, on the other hand, don''t have the same luxury.'

    my last post on this topic ([Think investment policy first, not just NFP](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2013/09/think-investment-policy-first-not-just.html)),
    I suggested that the investor deal with the soft issues of family dynamics surrounding
    his foundation. If expectations are not managed properly and agreed to, it can
    result in ugly family disputes and litigation between family members decades later.
