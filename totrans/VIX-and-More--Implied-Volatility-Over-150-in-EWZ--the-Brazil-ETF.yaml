    implied volatility. Some, of course, are more compelling than others.

    [Brazil](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Brazil) ETF. This resource-rich
    country has seen its ETF lose more than half of its value over the past year,
    coupled with a dramatic rise in volatility over the course of the past month.

    one can discern that [implied volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/implied%20volatility)
    and [historical volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/historical%20volatility)
    had been hovering in the range of 40 even as the ETF trended down during the summer.
    Starting in early September, the increase in volume in both the ETF and the options
    hints than an even wilder ride is coming.

- en: In fact, implied volatility spiked from 40 to over 140, with historical volatility
    making similar gains. At the moment, both mean IV and HV are over 120, with both
    the near the money calls and puts expiring at the end of the week showing implied
    volatility readings in excess of 150\. This is country risk at extreme levels.

    environments may wish to look at [bear call spreads](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/bear%20call%20spread)
    for a short bias [and bull put spreads](http://www.optionsxpress.com/educate/strategies/bullputspread.aspx)
    for a long bias.
