    So what is alpha? Well, [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_(investment))

- en: Alpha is a risk-adjusted measure of the so-called active return on an investment.
    It is the return in excess of the compensation for the risk borne, and thus commonly
    used to assess active managers’ performances. Often, the return of a benchmark
    is subtracted in order to consider relative performance, which yields Jensen’s
    alpha

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The information ratio is often used to gauge the skill of managers of mutual
    funds, [hedge](http://hedgefund.blogspot.com/) funds, etc. In this case, it measures
    the active return of the manager’s portfolio divided by the amount of risk that
    the manager takes relative to the benchmark.

    “Where do [alphas](http://web.mit.edu/alo/www/Papers/active_pub.pdf) come from?”,
    which then raises the question as to what you’d need to start a hedge fund. This
    luckily is partially answered by an article over on [LifeontheBuySide](http://www.lifeonthebuyside.com/):
    How to [Start](http://www.lifeonthebuyside.com/start-a-hedge-fund/) a Hedge Fund
    … and Buy that House with the Pool and the Pond. Key to a hedge fund, other than
    the strategy 🙂 , is the back office, and the need for a Prime Broker. JPMorgan
    and Goldman Sachs are two such player, but there are more – the usual suspects
    🙂 This raises another question; should a hedge fund have more than one prime broker?
    Again a google offer some views, one of which dates from [2008](http://www.ml.com/media/113487.pdf),
    but is possibly still relevant, and concludes that a second broker will benefit:'

    Marshall Wace hedge fund complex began to track the performance of brokers’ ideas
    systematically. MW found that their ideas regularly outperformed the market, prompting
    the firm to develop a proprietary website for brokers to submit ideas. MW went
    on to establish a variety of trade idea-driven hedge funds, an investment approach
    that enabled it to become one of the best performing, largest commission-payers
    in Europe.

    and used by more than 200 asset managers. This includes most of the world’s largest
    buy and sell side firms around the world. Industry commissions from trade ideas
    exceed $500 million. The buy side is driving this growth as investors seek to
    capture the alpha that is being generated externally to their own research departments,
    to benchmark their internal analysts and benchmark their brokers, and to regain
    visibility on market sentiment that has become obscured by the fragmentation of
    market venues.
