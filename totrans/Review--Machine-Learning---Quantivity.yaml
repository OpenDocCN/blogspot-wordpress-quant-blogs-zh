- en: Machine learning (ML) is one of those topics that elicits widely varying responses.
    Some folks think it’s rubbish for trading, recalling memories of failed early
    biologically-inspired AI techniques like [neural nets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_net).
    Other folks think it’s the holy grail (it’s not). And yet other folks are uncertain
    of its applicability, confounded by its multidisciplinary nature and corresponding
    lack of historic pedagogical coherence.

    tenor of modern ML books (*e.g.* Hastie *et al.* and Bishop; see [How to Learn
    Algorithmic Trading: Part 2](https://quantivity.wordpress.com/2010/01/12/how-to-learn-algorithmic-trading-part-2/),
    for more details). This style causes two practical problems:'

    This is a huge issue vis-à-vis trading, as using these methods require understanding
    their *intuition* and heavily adapting the algorithms to solve specific trading
    problems (filtering, prediction, signaling, *etc.*)'

    from integrals to for-loops, no matter what language, simply takes work. This
    is magnified as ML often provides the biggest bang for the buck when sequentially
    combined with other quant building blocks'

    a *practical algorithmic lens*: simply unlike other texts on ML, really shining
    at building conceptual intuition and providing intellectual breadcrumbs from idea
    to code for key ML themes. If you think in programmatic code and prefer lightweight
    mathematical machinery, this is a strong introduction text to ML.'

- en: 'First, use of multi-layer perceptron as a motivating model feels dated (chapter
    3). Perhaps this reflects stylistic bias in how to motivate ML: older texts derive
    motivation from classic AI (*e.g.* [Russell and Norvig](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)),
    while an increasing number of more recent texts derive motivation from statistical
    learning (*i.e.* regression, ranking, and classification). Both are valid perspectives,
    but their precedent insights are quite different.'
