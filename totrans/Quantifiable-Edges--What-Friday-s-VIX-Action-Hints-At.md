# Quantifiable Edges: What Friday's VIX Action Hints At

> 来源：[http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2012/09/what-fridays-vix-action-hints-at.html#0001-01-01](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2012/09/what-fridays-vix-action-hints-at.html#0001-01-01)

Even with the SPX rising Friday, the VIX managed to close up a bit. The VIX will typically trade in a direction opposite the SPX, so it is unusual that they both close higher. On Fridays, the VIX has a natural tendency to dip in the afternoon, so it is most unusual to see them both close higher on Friday. The study below was last seen in 4/30/12 subscriber letter. It examines other instances of the VIX and SPX both closing higher on a Friday while the SPX is in an uptrending market. All stats are updated.

As you can see, there appears to be a decent downside edge suggested by this study. That edge has primarily played out over the first three days.
