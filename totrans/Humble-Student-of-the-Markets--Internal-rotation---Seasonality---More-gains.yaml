    the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    is the most bullish month of the year for S&P 500 in the last 20 years and positive
    80% of the time. Combined with the recent healthy internal rotation in the market,
    and if seasonality continues to track, the stock market should grind higher for
    the remainder of the month.
