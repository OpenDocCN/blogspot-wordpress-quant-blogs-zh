    reflect panic. Tops are usually slower to develop. Hence the trader's adage, "Take
    the stairs up, and escalator down."

    overbought/oversold indicators are less useful at tops than bottoms. While it
    may be timely for traders to tilt to the long side when panic starts to appear,
    market euphoria are not good trading signals of market tops. Savvy traders know
    to wait for a bearish break when the market gets overbought and giddy.
