- en: The main market focus of last week was NVIDIA. Anticipation was building ahead
    of the company’s earnings report and option positioning was extremely bullish.
    In the end, the bulls were rewarded by a blowout report. NVIDIA’s stock surged
    and pulled the market up with it.
  prefs: []

- en: However, the advance was marred by poor internals. The rally in the S&P 500
    took it to the top of its Bollinger Band, but it’s rare that upper BB rides are
    accompanied by negative RSI divergences and poor participation. Moreover, it’s
    unusual to see the market rally to an all-time high with the NASDAQ Summation
    Index flat when it should have been a source of strength.
