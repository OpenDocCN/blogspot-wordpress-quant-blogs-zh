    it would be good to continue the series of posts that I began with the British
    version [“We Will Do Whatever it Takes”](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2012/07/we-will-do-whatever-it-takes.html)
    with my favorite article written during the Asia Pacific crisis in 1997.

    still have reason to fear the knock-on effect of a successful onslaught on the
    baht. For now, Thailand has been crowing about a victory over the speculators.
    Mr Amnuay has even promised to bring interest rates, which have been kept high
    to protect the baht, down by two percentage points this year. **It is as if a
    little guy, having survived one round with the big bullies, was dancing around
    with his fists up, saying, go on, hit me again.**

    defeated the markets (greedy speculators), please let me know.  I am absolutely
    amazed at the confidence in central banks and politicians, especially in the United
    States.
