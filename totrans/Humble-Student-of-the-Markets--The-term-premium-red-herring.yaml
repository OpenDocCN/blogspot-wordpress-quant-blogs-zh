    was attributed to concerns over a soaring fiscal deficit and a rising supply of
    Treasury paper. This led to upward pressure on the term premium, or compensation
    for holding longer duration assets, and real yields.

    the market had to face a blowout jobs report, a surprise Middle East war, and
    hot PPI and slightly hot CPI prints. In the face of such news, one would think
    this would put upward pressure on yields. Instead, Treasury yields retreated.

    an explanation doesn’t seem plausible as the USD Index fell in lockstep. If there
    had been a flight to safety, the USD would have been bid.

    term premium and real rates was a red herring.
