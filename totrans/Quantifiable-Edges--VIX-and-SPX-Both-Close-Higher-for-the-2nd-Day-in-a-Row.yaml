- en: The SPX and the VIX typically move in opposite directions. It is somewhat unusual
    to see them both move higher on the same day. It is especially unusual to see
    this happen 2 days in a row as we saw on Monday and Tuesday. Below is a study
    that looks SPX performance following such occurrences. It only considers those
    instances that occurred when the SPX was trading above its 200ma.

    over the next 1-3 days.
