    and missed expectations; fixed asset investment slowed, but was in line with expectations;
    and retail sales rose and beat expectations. The overall picture is a slowing
    industrial, export and infrastructure spending and an upbeat household sector.

    of New China-Old China ETF pairs. When the lines are rising, New China consumer
    led growth stocks are outperforming and, when the lines are falling, Old China
    credit driven infrastructure growth is ascendant. We have seen the New China stocks
    begin to outperform in April and they haven't looked back since.

    shows the relative performance of the stock markets of China's major Asian trading
    partners, Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea, relative to the Chinese market. I
    used USD denominated ETFs to filter out any currency effects and used FXI as the
    proxy for China. As the chart indicates, the major Asian market ETFs that trade
    and export to China are all outperforming FXI. If Mr. Market was indeed worried
    about a China slowdown affecting her Asian trading partners, then these markets
    would be underperforming.
