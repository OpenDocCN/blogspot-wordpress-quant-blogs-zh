    not leaders, and have opinions that went not engaged in partisanship, patronizing
    interest groups, are generally vacuous and unoffensive ('I'm for working families').
    But also, they are squeaky clean. Michael Bloomberg, in an interview before being
    elected mayor of New York, was asked whether he had taken marijuana. "You bet
    I did. And I enjoyed it," he answered. No Presidency for him.

    not want my late mother to read. Many of them make statements I would not want
    my neighbors to know, because an explanation of the context would seem special
    pleading. Some are snarky comments on friends I generally like, but can't resist
    a special barb with another. 'If all men knew what each said of the other, there
    would not be four friends in the world' said Pascal.

    to someone with bad faith. They will cherry pick what they find most appalling,
    most obscene, and point out the obvious nefarious conclusions. Defending the comments
    just makes you look more guilty. It''s a violation of privacy of the first order.
    Some group based loosely around the message board 4Chan, got a hold of the password
    to another Palin email account: gov.palin@yahoo.com. Someone reset the password
    and tried to alert Sarah. But he also posted the new password, causing multiple
    people to try to log in at once, freezing the account for 24 hours. And now, the
    account has been deleted. But some emails are now out there.'

    government's ability to listen in on some conversations as the ultimate violation
    of privacy, even though in those cases, the evidence can only be used for highly
    specified ends, and the intrusions are highly regulated, even if the original
    search is made without a hearing from a judge. This is just a fishing expedition
    for enemies. If you think only the government, and not litigious, or bad faith
    private enemies, can bankrupt you and prevent you from working, think again.

- en: Richard Posner states that people desire privacy is for two reasons, embarrassment
    (of things like being seen naked) and to hide crimes. I can think of another.
    If someone is given enough leeway in defining what they are looking for--defining
    the crime--and has sufficient bad faith, they will take snippets of one's work
    and present it in an incriminating way, so that a judge, or the public, thinks
    you are guilty. Think of Ken Starr on a fishing expedition that went from a land
    deal in Arkansas, to sex with an intern. Of course, by the time he found that
    'crime', he had a principle,

  zh: 理查德·波斯纳（Richard Posner）认为人们渴望隐私的原因有两个：尴尬（比如被人看到裸体）和隐藏犯罪。我还可以想到另一个原因。如果某人在定义他们要寻找的东西（定义犯罪）方面有足够的自由，并且持有恶意，他们将会截取你工作中的片段，并以一种有罪的方式呈现出来，以至于法官或公众认为你有罪。想想肯·斯塔尔（Ken
    Starr）从阿肯色州的一桩土地交易，到与实习生的性关系这样一次渔猎。当然，当他找到那个“罪行”的时候，他已经有了一个原则，

    It is also why my email, and computer, are routinely scrubbed with digital bleach,
    when not incinerated (really). This is also why politicians are generally not
