    just an illogical and somewhat absurd analysis of his remarks.

- en: If (and I think a hugely doubtful if this time around) the US maintains the
    status quo with the dollar as reserve currency for the world, then all of the
    events listed below incite a rally in US Treasuries, in which Bill Gross would
    want to participate.  Neither Bill Gross nor his fund receive any benefit from
    being long a US dollar, since he and his clients are already implicitly long the
    dollar and he is measured by US bonds.  Selling US Treasuries and holding US dollars
    as cash implies a belief that US interest rates move higher.  What most likely
    causes US interest rates to move higher are inflation through higher commodity
    prices, continued stimulative and aggressive monetary policy, and/or abandonment
    of the US dollar as a reserve currency.  However, strangely enough, each of those
    reasons leads to the other two.  Monetary policy is inflationary and leads to
    higher rates and eventual loss of confidence in the Fed and abandonment of the
    US dollar as reserve currency; and similarly but in reverse inflation through
    higher commodity prices causes Emerging Asia to rectify their undervalued currencies
    by selling US Treasuries and US dollars but does nothing to stop Ben Bernanke
    and Fed policy.

    as a reserve currency in an imbalanced and vulnerable global situation.  The only
    thing that fixes these imbalances are lower US dollar and higher rates, and we
    do not get one without the other, and we don’t get any without some considerable
    pain.  I always shutter when I hear “This time is different,” so let me be clear,

    as the US finds the limits to its monetary and fiscal policy.

- en: Now, the real question is what reserve currency fails first and faces speculative
    attack.  If it is the Euro, then the US dollar probably rallies, and we’re stuck
    in an imbalanced system.  If it is the British Pound or Japanese Yen, then the
    first line of defense will be to sell the US dollar and US Treasuries, which then
    leads to a domino effect and US dollar failure.  If it is the US dollar, then
    I don’t know what to do except be short everything except Emerging Asian currencies
    and potentially the only thing of value in the US (agricultural commodities).
