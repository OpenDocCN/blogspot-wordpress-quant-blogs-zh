    pointing to its horrific failed IPO launch and seemingly inevitable crash to zero.
    While my focus here isn't really so much on fundamentals or basic TA; I do want
    to comment on some subjective thoughts on the matter as well as illustrate one
    catchy graphic I put together.

    the past, I can't help but think back to how overvalued I 'felt' stocks like Ebay
    and Google felt to me at the outset.  We all know that that we can't directly
    compare such small samples in any statistical manner with much conviction, but
    that qualitative sense in me feels that Facebook is one of those Wall Street darlings
    we rarely encounter and wish we could go back and buy at a discount.  Sure there
    were the megaflops (Blackstone, The Globe, etc) that never revived quite back,
    but then again consider the Lynch method of buying (...are the masses using it?),
    the massive institutional support available, the number of shorts that are sure
    to pile on, and more importantly, the nagging fact that it is consistently one
    of the highest viewed websites of all (typically above or next to Google and Baidu
    -- don't believe me, check Alexa).  Ok, but enough of the soapbox on those biased
    musings-- one quantitative comparison to consider in the chart above is how Ebay
    fared at the outset and was also lambasted as a failure throughout Internet chat-rooms
    and various media pundits.  What I have graphed is a drawdown for both (with adjusted
    ebay quotes) relative to the 1st day open bid.  The last points on Facebook are
    potential drawdown (relative to IPO opening price) trajectories  at

    about semi qualitative opportunities, but then again, we don't get these types
    of juggernaut long term opportunities all that often.*  As always, please make
    your own informed decisions, and I'll try to get back on topic...  one of these
    days.

    a fat tail flight to safety avalanche (of which I pointed out have been exceedingly
    abundant of late); then keep in mind Facebook and any other equity leaders should
    be expected to plunge together; hence, the emphasis on LONG term  portfolio component
    opportunity.
