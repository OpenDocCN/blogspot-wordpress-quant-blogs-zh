- en: on "Gattopardo economics" -- his phrase for recent efforts to paper over the
    fundamental failings of mainstream economic theory by making superficial changes,
    thereby leaving the main structures intact. Such efforts seek "change that keeps
    things the same... Gattopardo economics makes change more difficult because it
    deceives people into thinking change has taken place. By masquerading as change,
    it crowds-out space for real change."

    di Lampedusa, about class conflict in Sicily in the 1860s. In the novel, the aristocracy
    engineers change of a sort that deflects the real threat to their power and leaves
    them still in charge.

- en: I don't know if Palley's account of the causes of the financial crisis and subsequent
    stagnation is definitely correct, but it rings true to me. It was the end result
    of broad financial de-regulation, coupled with relentless downward pressure on
    ordinary wages over the past few decades driven by globalization. This set the
    stage for a three decade credit bubble which ultimately burst. The part I'm not
    sure about is his claim that stagnant growth now is due to a lack of aggregate
    demand linked to soaring wealth inequality. Sounds plausible. Anyway, here's his
    closing summary. The

    of mainstream economists and the neoliberal paradigm in creating the crisis. Scratch
    any side of the neoliberal policy box and you quickly find the ideas of mainstream
    economists. Corporate globalization was justified by appeal to economists’ comparative

    by economists’ claims that unions and the minimum wage cause unemployment. The
    retreat from full employment was justified by the Friedman’s theory of the natural
    rate of unemployment which implied central banks should focus on low inflation
    as they cannot permanently affect unemployment. The attack on government and regulation
    was supported by Chicago School claims that costs of market failure are small
    relative the costs of government failure and policy induced market distortions.
    Government was also charged with diminishing freedom and paving “the road to serfdom”,
    so that freedom was best served by a minimalist government or night watchman state.
    Financial deregulation was justified by claims it would produce a free lunch by
    increasing efficiency of resource allocation.

- en: After the financial crisis of 2008 many Keynesian economists hoped there would
    be profound change of theory within the economics profession. The profession stood
    discredited owing to its complete failure to anticipate the crisis, whereas Keynesian
    economists had anticipated the crisis and also showed how neoliberal economics
    contributed to it. However, change has been minimal.

    and political interests of powerful elites, and those elites have reason to defend
    it and block change. Even if only sub-consciously, professional economists also
    have a private (utility maximizing) interest in maintaining neoliberal ideas to
    the extent that they are intellectually invested in those ideas and their careers
    have been built on them.

    influence the future. That is because how we explain the crisis will influence
    the direction of future economic policy. Gattopardo economics is one of the mechanisms
    for blocking intellectual change. It works by muddying the water and appearing
    to offer change when in fact it keeps everything the same. That is why it is so
    important to expose gattopardo economics.
