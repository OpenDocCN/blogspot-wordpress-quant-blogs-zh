- en: Encountered a problem in trading where we did not properly adjust the liquidity
    (depth) level coming back from the exchange. Basically when we push down an order
    would decrement available liquidity. The next tick from the exchange would reflect
    the new available liquidity (or so we naively thought).

    was filled) is reflected in the depth level. Given this, the affect of the order
    will not be represented in the depth.

    back with lower priority, so can be an overly conservative method of measurement.

- en: The net affect of not handling this properly was that we saw more depth than
    was actually there. This meant that for aggresive algos trying to pull some part
    of advertised depth, ended up with partial fills based on a flawed liquidity tracking
    model.
