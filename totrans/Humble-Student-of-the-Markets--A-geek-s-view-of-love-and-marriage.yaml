    in her 2014 TED Talk and recently released book, "The Mathematics of Love," that
    the best predictor of long-lasting relationships is how positive and negative
    a couple can be to one another.

    and his team. Over many years they observed hundreds of couples and noted their
    facial expressions, heart rates, blood pressure, skin conductivity, and the words
    they used in conversation with their partners.

    happy, bad behavior is dismissed as unusual." For example, a wife might assume
    her husband's grumpiness is due to stress at work or a bad night's sleep.

    "Bad behavior is considered the norm." A husband, for instance, might think his
    wife''s grumpiness is "typical," due to her "selfishness" or other negative personality
    trait.'

    and thus are more likely to give each other the benefit of a doubt. When there
    is an issue, they're more likely to bring it up quickly, fix it, and move on.

    process of investing, largely because emotional swings can lead us astray. Yet
    human relationships is about precisely that - emotional bonds. Fry's work bridges
    that gap with mathematics and demonstrated how to make a relationship last beyond
    the initial sparks.
