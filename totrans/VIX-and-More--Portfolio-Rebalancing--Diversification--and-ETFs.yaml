    end of the year is a time when many investors think about rebalancing their portfolios,
    enhancing diversification, and lowering risk.  It is also a good time to cut loose
    bad ideas and bad investments, while at the same time opening one’s mind to the
    possibility of new types of investments.

    to find them.  Without a doubt, many the best investments for 2008 will found
    among the ETF universe.  This should not come as a surprise, as the ETF universe
    has, by far, the broadest array of investment vehicles.  So while some individual
    stocks may top next year’s list in terms of total return, the careful selection
    of a few ETFs in new [asset classes](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/asset%20class)
    will provide a better opportunity to enhance returns and lower overall portfolio
    risk at the same time.

    and the [Global ETF Family Tree](http://bespokeinvest.typepad.com/BespokeETFCheatSheetGlobal.pdf),
    each of which are superbly organized.  For my purposes, however, I can do one
    better with a four page PDF from [ETF Guide](http://etfguide.com/):  [ETF Reference
    Guide 2007 Q4](http://etfguide.com/images/ETF_TSG/etfrefguide/ETF%20Reference%20Guide%202007Q4.pdf).  Updated
    quarterly, this document gives me four important pieces of information that are
    not available from the Bespoke cheat sheets:'
