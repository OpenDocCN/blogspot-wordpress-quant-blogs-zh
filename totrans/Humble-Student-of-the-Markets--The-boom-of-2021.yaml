    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or

    constrained by the inflationary effects of excessive debt, and until it hits that

    matter, deficits don't matter until the bond market decides it matters. There
    is no free lunch. It does not mean that government doesn't have to tax. Taxes
    are and remain a tool of fiscal policy. It is not Keynesian economics. Keynes
    believed that governments should try run deficits in bad times and surpluses in
    good times. MMT says that debt, by itself, is not a constraining factor.

    implementation of MMT will be a boon, or if Kelton will become the Arthur Laffer
    of the Left. The bill will be payable much later. In the meantime, investors should
    be prepared to party. If the results were to turn out to be catastrophic, investors
    can then opportunistically position themselves to profit from the cleanup.
