# VIX and More: Google Fixes Gmail Problems Plaguing VIX and More Newsletter Subscribers

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/08/google-fixed-gmail-problems-plaguing.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/08/google-fixed-gmail-problems-plaguing.html#0001-01-01)

Apologies to all the *[VIX and More](http://vixandmoresubscriber.blogspot.com/)* [newsletter](http://vixandmoresubscriber.blogspot.com/) subscribers who have been victimized by Google’s ([GOOG](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/GOOG)) [Gmail glitch](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2010/08/25/urnidgns852573C4006938808525778A006513A9.DTL) that resulted in multiple emails containing Sunday’s subscriber newsletter.

According to Google's [technical team](http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/gmail/thread?tid=4ec0aff919d4a7c3&hl=en) and [news reports](http://www.reuters.com/article/idUS16756376120100827), this glitch was finally resolved yesterday.

I note that a few subscribers have elected to cancel their subscription during this period of Gmail difficulties. To those who have canceled their subscriptions, I want to make four points:

1.  Google and various news reports (see links above) confirm that the problem originated with Google
2.  the multiple emails did not involve any virus (Norton and two other anti-virus programs confirm I am running in a virus-free environment) and thus did not put any subscriber at risk
3.  I elected not to communicate more than once during this period, because I was concerned about starting another chain reaction of recurring emails
4.  anyone who recently canceled their subscription and wishes to re-subscribe may do so [here](http://vixandmoresubscriber.blogspot.com/) and receive the next 14 days free of charge

Thank you all for your understanding and patience.

Cheers and good trading,

-Bill
