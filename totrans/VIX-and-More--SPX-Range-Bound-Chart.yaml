    as well as my take on [The Elusive Trading Range](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/06/elusive-trading-range.html)
    from mid-June, I thought I would share a chart I included in last week’s [subscriber
    newsletter](http://vixandmoresubscriber.blogspot.com/).

- en: The chart below captures daily bars of the SPX going back six months. It includes
    [Fibonacci](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Fibonacci) retracement
    levels based on the April SPX high of 1219 and the July 1^(st) low of 1010\. I
    have also added secondary support and resistance levels (black dotted lines) at
    1065 and 1170 and have shaded the center of the Fibonacci zone (38.2% to 61.8%)
    in what looks like a salmon color (hey, it’s lunch time.) In addition to the SPX
    support and resistance lines, the study below the main chart is of the [McClellan
    Summation Index](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/McClellan%20Summation%20Index)
    (NYSI), a measure of market breadth, which shows more strength than has been reflected
    in just the recent price action.

- en: My working hypothesis continues to be that we are in a trading zone that have
    been and will likely continue to be defined by some of the support and resistance
    levels on this chart. If this turns out to be the case, even with the VIX at what
    is now almost a three month low, [straddles](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/straddle),
    [strangles](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/strangle), [butterflies](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/butterfly)
    and [condors](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/condor) can still be
    attractive trades.
