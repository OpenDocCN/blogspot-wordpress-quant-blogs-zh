    [GS](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=gs&hl=en) and [BSC](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=bsc&hl=en)
    quickly fade from green to red – and that weakness reflected in the [XBD (Broker/Dealer
    Index](http://stockcharts.com/charts/gallery.html?%24xbd).)

    your portfolio these days.  You can probably accomplish the same task by erecting
    a safety net under just one or two sectors, such as the home builders or financial
    institutions.  So I looked at my favorite bellwether, Goldman Sachs, to see how
    their implied volatility has fared in the past month or so.  While it makes for
    an interesting visual, I have not included the Goldman chart because the company
    has a history of slipping punches.  A better chart is the XBD, whose [components](http://finance.yahoo.com/q/cp?s=%5EXBD)
    include 12 companies in the broker-dealer space.

    XBD going back three months.  Prior to July, the XBD IV spent 95% of the past
    year in a narrow 20-25 range.  After topping 50 in mid-August, the XBD IV looked
    to be headed back down to 30 or so, until the recent spike left it over 40 yesterday.

    up at support levels such as 215 and 208, I also recommend keeping a weather eye
    on the XBD’s implied volatility to see what the trend and absolute levels of IV
    tell us about the thinking of options players.  It is quite likely that the tip
    of the next iceberg may be found floating in the IV chart before it shows up on
    a price chart.
