    700 and now moving in the mid-800s, sentiment models now show that the advance
    may be overdone in the short run.

    positions as a percentage of open interest of commercials, or hedgers, in gold.
    While readings are technically in the neutral zone, they are very near levels
    where a signal to go short is generated.

    net positioning has climbed gradually since it collapsed in August, when a bullish
    signal was triggered. It hasn't yet climbed to what my setup considers any kind
    of bullish extreme. But the other signal I use for this setup - based on the large
    speculator total open interest - has been on a bearish signal for the past four
    weeks. This is owing to a 31-percent increase in the large spec total open interest
    in the past month - typically a sign of downward pressure on the price of gold.
    So since the two signals don't agree, the overall setup is in cash.
