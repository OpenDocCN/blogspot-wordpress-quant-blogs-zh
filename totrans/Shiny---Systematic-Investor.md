# Shiny | Systematic Investor

> 来源：[https://systematicinvestor.wordpress.com/shiny/#0001-01-01](https://systematicinvestor.wordpress.com/shiny/#0001-01-01)

## Shiny

Examples of the amazing [Shiny](http://www.rstudio.com/shiny/) framework and [Systematic Investor Toolbox](https://systematicinvestor.wordpress.com/systematic-investor-toolbox/) to analyze stocks, make back-tests, and create summary reports.

Examples:

Please note that Back Test applications take longer time to update the plots/tables and hence maybe more appropriate to run from your local computer.

For example to run [Single Stock Plot](http://glimmer.rstudio.com/systematicin/one.stock/) from your computer, you first need to install [Shiny](http://www.rstudio.com/shiny/). And next execute following commands:

```
library(shiny)
runGitHub('SIT','systematicinvestor', subdir = 'Shiny/one.stock')

```

P.S. The plan is to share 5 examples. I will post post one example a day, starting tonight.
