    "A New (Better?) Measure of Risk and Uncertainty: The Volatility of Acceleration")
    presented a novel way of incorporating acceleration as an alternative measure
    risk. The preliminary results and also intuition demonstrate that it deserves
    consideration as another piece of information that can be used to forecast risk.
    While I posed the question as to whether acceleration was a “better” indicator
    than volatility,**the more useful question should be whether we can combine the
    two into perhaps a better indicator than either in isolation**. Traditional volatility
    is obviously more widely used, and is critical for solving traditional portfolio
    optimization. Therefore, it is a logical choice as a baseline indicator.'

    a linear function of input. Non-linear filters in contrast generate output that
    is non-linear with respect to input. An example of non-linear filter would be
    polynomial regression, or even the humble median. The goal of non-linear filters
    is to create a superior means of weighting data to create more accurate output.
    By using a non-linear filter it is possible to substantially reduce lag and increase
    responsiveness. Since volatility is highly predictable, it stands to reason that
    we would like to reduce lag and increase responsiveness as much as possible to
    generate superior results.

- en: 'So how would we create a volatility measure that incorporates acceleration?
    The answer is that we need to dynamically weight each squared deviation from the
    average as a function of the magnitude of acceleration- where greater absolute
    acceleration should generate an exponentially higher weighting on each data point.
    Here is how it is calculated for a 10-day NLV. (Don’t panic, I will post a spreadsheet
    in the next post):'

    acceleration. The general calculation can be applied many different ways but this
    method is fairly intuitive and generic. In the next post I will show how to make
    this non-linear filter even more responsive to changes in volatility.
