    such stocks have a greater diversity of beliefs, and so if people dismiss the
    objectively bad odds of beating the market, such people will be drawn to stocks
    where they are in the extremum, and highly volatile stocks have the most biased
    extremums.  One might think these people are irrational, but in the big picture
    people with this bias actually have a huge advantage, why Danny Kahneman said
    it's the bias he most wants his children to have.

    that''s what the public, seeking to avoid the stress of uncertainty, craves. In
    other words, to be popular (read: successful), you need to be unwarrantedly confident.
    This takes either an amoral cognitive dissonance or ignorance.'

    the out-of-sample data. That is, the projection from 2008 is being done in 2013\.
     The degrees of freedom in this model would make a technical analyst blush. I
    can understand the allure of this approach (economics is about modeling), but
    anyone who has been around a while should cop to the patent overfitting that goes
    on ''outside the model''. I would bet anyone that if they set this model up in

    model that would have worked.'
