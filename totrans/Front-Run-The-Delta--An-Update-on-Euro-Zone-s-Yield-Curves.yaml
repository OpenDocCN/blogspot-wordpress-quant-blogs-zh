- en: The greatest experiment in multi-national currency reform continues to unfold. 
    I don't expect the Euro to dissolve in the complete sense, however I expect one
    or several member-states to remove themselves from the system and reissue an IMF-backed
    currency.  That seems to be the way things are done in these types of situations,
    for instance

    meticulously studied for decades to come.
