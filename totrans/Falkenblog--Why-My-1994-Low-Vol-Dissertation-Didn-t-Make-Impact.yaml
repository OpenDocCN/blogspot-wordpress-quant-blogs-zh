    has been negatively correlated with expected return for NYSE&AMEX stocks and this
    relationship is not accounted for by several well-known prespecified factors (e.g.,
    the price-to-book ratio or size). More volatile stocks have lower returns, other
    things equal. In fact, one of the prespecified factors, size, obscures this inverse
    relationship. Second, I document that open-end mutual funds have strong preferences
    for stocks that are liquid, well-known, and most interestingly, highly volatile
    stocks.**'

    so was unimpressed by the lack of interest in my findings. I got no 'fly-outs'
    to present my ideas, even though part of this dissertation led to an article published

    in a finance job. The Northwestern financial department didn't find my work particularly
    noteworthy in part because it didn't have any good theoretical explanation, no
    equilibrium model consistent with utility maximizing agents. That was a constraint
    back then, though it isn't any longer, so that's just bad timing on my part.

    have to say it's part of 'behavioral finance', as the popularity of Danny Kahneman
    and Freakonomics changed the standards. But asset pricing held out longer than
    most other fields, and so the seminal 'low vol' reference is  Ang, Hodrick, Xing,
    and Zhang (2006). The paper is mainly about trying to test a very rigorous extension
    to the standard model, looking at the volatility of volatility, but noted at the
    end the strange fact that volatility was, by itself, implied lower future returns.
    That finding was not the main point, just curious, but it highlights that early
    on, one couldn't just report something so contrary to the standard model--higher
    risk generates higher return--without a convincing, rigorous, explanation. Now,
    it's common for people just to throw in a constraint and ignore the inconsistencies
    with unconstrained investors, whose presence would put back the CAPM results (see

    of a game theorist, and he suggested I needed a real finance person as well. The
    first prof I pitched my idea to was not very receptive, and so I told him that
    she didn't like it. He was the Kellogg's (Northwestern's B-school) academic dean
    at that time, and so when he called her to ask about her reservations, she called
    me into her office, weeping, as she basically thought I was submarining her career
    by bad mouthing her. I had no idea it would be interpreted that way, but I was
    naive. Alas, her boyfriend at the time was the head of the finance department,
    so he was not going to be an advocate. Eventually, I got one finance prof on my
    committee, but he was a young guy without any pull among other departments.

    first round at the JoF. However, my reviewer, a well-known guy, took umbrage at
    one of my statements in the second round and ended his review by saying not only
    would he not recommend my paper, but that he did not encourage me to work on this
    further (say, submitting to a lower tier journal). I would send papers out to
    other journals and got many dismissive rejections, such as one professor telling
    me I was trying to say the earth is flat, and one helpfully telling me they would
    save my submission fee by not even sending it to a reviewer. Of course, prior
    to 2006, if any of them were published, they would have been highly cited today.

    wasn''t found uninteresting, rather, inconceivable. This instigated me to start
    an actual fund based on the insight, a '' low vol'' fund, and I got this started
    around 1996. I got a few interviews out in NYC with some big financial firms,
    but unfortunately, laid all my cards out on the table: invest in low vol, make
    an extra 2% with 3/4 the risk. With hindsight, this was a terrible pitch. To the
    extent one believes it''s true, one can easily just take the idea and implement
    it. It seemed so simple, something seemed wrong. Everyone asked: but if it''s
    true everyone would just invest in low vol stocks?'

    main ingredient among a couple others, spread out worldwide, hedging with basic
    futures. It can generate a nice 1.0 Sharpe, and did for me historically. Alas,
    after I left one fund to do this on my own, my boss sued me for violating our
    confidentiality agreement, in that anything I had done there was 'his property,'
    so I spent much time documenting the fact that I had figured this all out before
    I went to his fund around 2003, and much of it public knowledge circa 2007-8\.
    Eventually, I did get another chance to do that, and again it worked, but that
    multi-strat foundered for many reasons, but after that, I found most hedge funds
    were all looking for 2+ Sharpe strategies...
