    has been negatively correlated with expected return for NYSE&AMEX stocks and this
    relationship is not accounted for by several well-known prespecified factors (e.g.,
    the price-to-book ratio or size). More volatile stocks have lower returns, other
    things equal. In fact, one of the prespecified factors, size, obscures this inverse
    relationship. Second, I document that open-end mutual funds have strong preferences
    for stocks that are liquid, well-known, and most interestingly, highly volatile
    stocks.**'

    in a finance job. The Northwestern financial department didn't find my work particularly
    noteworthy in part because it didn't have any good theoretical explanation, no
    equilibrium model consistent with utility maximizing agents. That was a constraint
    back then, though it isn't any longer, so that's just bad timing on my part.

- en: You don't need an equilibrium story for empirical results anymore, you just
    have to say it's part of 'behavioral finance', as the popularity of Danny Kahneman
    and Freakonomics changed the standards. But asset pricing held out longer than
    most other fields, and so the seminal 'low vol' reference is  Ang, Hodrick, Xing,
    and Zhang (2006). The paper is mainly about trying to test a very rigorous extension
    to the standard model, looking at the volatility of volatility, but noted at the
    end the strange fact that volatility was, by itself, implied lower future returns.
    That finding was not the main point, just curious, but it highlights that early
    on, one couldn't just report something so contrary to the standard model--higher
    risk generates higher return--without a convincing, rigorous, explanation. Now,
    it's common for people just to throw in a constraint and ignore the inconsistencies
    with unconstrained investors, whose presence would put back the CAPM results (see

  zh: 现在，你不再需要一个均衡的故事来解释实证结果，你只需要说它是“行为金融学”的一部分。就像 Danny Kahneman 和 Freakonomics 的流行改变了标准一样。但是资产定价比大多数其他领域持续了更长时间，所以具有影响力的“低波动”参考文献是
    Ang、Hodrick、Xing 和 Zhang（2006）。这篇论文主要是关于试图测试标准模型的一个非常严格的扩展，看看波动的波动，但在最后指出了一个奇怪的事实，即波动本身意味着未来收益较低。这个发现并不是重点，只是好奇，但它突显了早期，一个人不能只是报告一些与标准模型相违背的东西--高风险产生高回报--而不经过令人信服、严谨的解释。现在，人们常常只是随意加入限制性的条件，忽略了与不受限制的投资者矛盾之处，他们的存在会让CAPM的结果重新出现(见[这里](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2537050)进行讨论)。

- en: Another issue was that I started writing my dissertation under the guidance
    of a game theorist, and he suggested I needed a real finance person as well. The
    first prof I pitched my idea to was not very receptive, and so I told him that
    she didn't like it. He was the Kellogg's (Northwestern's B-school) academic dean
    at that time, and so when he called her to ask about her reservations, she called
    me into her office, weeping, as she basically thought I was submarining her career
    by bad mouthing her. I had no idea it would be interpreted that way, but I was
    naive. Alas, her boyfriend at the time was the head of the finance department,
    so he was not going to be an advocate. Eventually, I got one finance prof on my
    committee, but he was a young guy without any pull among other departments.

  zh: 另一个问题是我在一个博弈论者的指导下开始写我的论文，他建议我也需要一个真正的金融专业人士。我向第一个教授推销我的想法时，他对此并不乐意，于是我告诉他说她不喜欢这个想法。他当时是Kellogg's（西北大学的商学院）的学术院长，所以当他给她打电话问她的顾虑时，她给我打电话到她的办公室，眼泪汪汪地，因为她基本上认为我通过说坏话而想毁了她的事业。我完全不知道会被这样解释，但我实在是太天真了。不幸的是，当时她的男朋友是金融系的主任，所以他不会成为我的支持者。最终，我有了一个财务教授在我的委员会里，但他是一个年轻人，在其他部门无任何影响力。
- en: Yet, once I did publish that JoF piece, I did have my low-vol finding make the
    first round at the JoF. However, my reviewer, a well-known guy, took umbrage at
    one of my statements in the second round and ended his review by saying not only
    would he not recommend my paper, but that he did not encourage me to work on this
    further (say, submitting to a lower tier journal). I would send papers out to
    other journals and got many dismissive rejections, such as one professor telling
    me I was trying to say the earth is flat, and one helpfully telling me they would
    save my submission fee by not even sending it to a reviewer. Of course, prior
    to 2006, if any of them were published, they would have been highly cited today.

  zh: 然而，一旦我发表了《JoF》的那篇文章，我的低波动发现就首次出现在了《JoF》的初审中。然而，我的审阅人，一位著名的人，对第二轮审阅中我说的一句话有所反感，并且在审阅结束时表示他不仅不会推荐我的论文，甚至也不鼓励我继续进行研究（比如，提交到一个较低级别的期刊）。我将论文发送到了其他期刊，并且得到了许多轻视性的拒绝，比如一位教授告诉我我在试图说地球是平的，还有一位很乐意地告诉我他们会节约我的提交费用，甚至都不向审阅人发送。当然，在2006年之前，如果其中任何一篇被发表，它们如今将会被引用次数非常多。
- en: 'I was heartened by the fact that most of these rejections were so strong: it
    wasn''t found uninteresting, rather, inconceivable. This instigated me to start
    an actual fund based on the insight, a '' low vol'' fund, and I got this started
    around 1996. I got a few interviews out in NYC with some big financial firms,
    but unfortunately, laid all my cards out on the table: invest in low vol, make
    an extra 2% with 3/4 the risk. With hindsight, this was a terrible pitch. To the
    extent one believes it''s true, one can easily just take the idea and implement
    it. It seemed so simple, something seemed wrong. Everyone asked: but if it''s
    true everyone would just invest in low vol stocks?'

  zh: 我被事实大为鼓舞，因为大多数拒绝意见都很强烈：不是觉得无趣，而是觉得难以想象。这促使我开始基于这一观点创立了一个真正的基金，即'低波动率'基金，我大约在1996年开始了这个基金。我在纽约市与一些大型金融公司进行了几次面试，但不幸的是，我把所有的牌都放在了桌面上：投资于低波动率，增加2%的收益，风险只有3/4。回想起来，这是一个糟糕的推销。从某种程度上来说，人们相信它是真实的，可以很容易地接受这个想法并加以实施。似乎这么简单，但感觉有些不对。每个人都问：但如果这是真的，每个人都会投资于低波动率股票，是吗？
- en: Later I applied this strategy within hedge funds, basically with low vol the
    main ingredient among a couple others, spread out worldwide, hedging with basic
    futures. It can generate a nice 1.0 Sharpe, and did for me historically. Alas,
    after I left one fund to do this on my own, my boss sued me for violating our
    confidentiality agreement, in that anything I had done there was 'his property,'
    so I spent much time documenting the fact that I had figured this all out before
    I went to his fund around 2003, and much of it public knowledge circa 2007-8\.
    Eventually, I did get another chance to do that, and again it worked, but that
    multi-strat foundered for many reasons, but after that, I found most hedge funds
    were all looking for 2+ Sharpe strategies...

  zh: 后来，我在对冲基金中应用了这一策略，基本上是以低波动率为主要因素，再加上几个其他因素，遍布全球，用基本期货进行对冲。它可以产生一个很好的1.0夏普比率，而且对我来说历史上确实如此。遗憾的是，在我离开一个基金自己做这个之后，我的老板起诉我违反了我们的保密协议，认为我在那里所做的任何事情都是'他的财产'，所以我花了很多时间记录了这样一个事实：我在2003年去他的基金之前就已经想清楚了这一切，并且在2007-8年左右这样的公众知识。最终，我确实有了另一次机会，再次成功，但是那个多策略基金因为很多原因而失败了，但之后，我发现大多数对冲基金都在寻找夏普比率超过2的策略...
