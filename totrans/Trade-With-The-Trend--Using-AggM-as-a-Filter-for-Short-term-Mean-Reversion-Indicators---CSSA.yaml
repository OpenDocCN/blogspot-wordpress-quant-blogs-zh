- en: In this example, we only permitted trades in the direction of the trend as defined
    by AggM (DVAM)which is a composite trend/mean-reversion indicator available at
    [www.dvindicators.com](http://www.dvindicators.com).  Long trades were triggered
    when AggM rose above 65 and ended when AggM closed below 35.  During this time
    period, we traded DVO from the long side only, going  long<50, exiting above 50\.
    Short trades began when AggM fell below 35, and were closed above 65\. During
    this time period we traded DVO from the short side only, going short>50 and exiting
    below 50\. Excluding 1998, this strategy produced strong returns and  very low
    drawdowns on average. This method works well with other indicators including RSI2
    as well.
