- en: that several days before the collapse Goldman sent an email to its clients noting
    that they would no longer backup Bear derivatives deals, as hedge funds were coming
    to Goldman to take a Bear derivative, scared about Bear's risk. Send out an email
    to a couple hundred clients, and everyone knows about it. Hedge funds saw this
    as a credible Goldman opining that the risk of Bear was too much. Then, everyone
    wanted their money out right away, and no bank can withstand that.
