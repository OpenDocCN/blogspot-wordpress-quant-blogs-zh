- en: What’s bothering the bond market? The 10-year Treasury yield (blue line) has
    shot up to levels last seen just before the GFC. The surge in yields has occurred
    just as investors are seeing better news on inflation. At the same time, core
    PCE (red line) has been falling. Shouldn’t that be good news for the trajectory
    of monetary policy? Why are yields rising?
