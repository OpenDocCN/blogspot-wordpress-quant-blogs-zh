    on time. That is, they are efficient. As Galbraith used to say, the Soviets never
    had involuntary unemployment! After the fall of the Iron Curtain and the revision
    of GDP data, this is rarely uttered much anymore.

    wartime confiscation of wealth from Europe's Jews financed about 30 percent of
    the expenditure of the German armed forces during WWII.

    on huge public works programs like Autobahns, protected industry from foreign
    competition, expanded credit, instituted jobs programs, bullied the private sector
    on prices and production decisions, vastly expanded the military, enforced capital
    controls, instituted family planning, penalized smoking, brought about national
    health care and unemployment insurance, imposed education standards, and eventually
    ran huge deficits. The Nazi interventionist program was essential to the regime's
    rejection of the market economy and its embrace of socialism in one country.

    do I. I suppose as an american of German heritage I should be more explicit about
    that, because on the internet it''s easy to misinterpret points that aren''t super
    straightforward (As Harrison Ford said in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade:
    "Nazis. I hate these guys."). Goldberg points out that other than their militaristic
    imperialism and racism, much of their policy is pretty consistent with modern
    liberal and progressive politics. The road to serfdom starts by giving the state
    a lot of power.'
