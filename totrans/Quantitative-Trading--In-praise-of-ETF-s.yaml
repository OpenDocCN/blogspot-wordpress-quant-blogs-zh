    So you can pretty much count on mean-reversion if you are on the long side.

    of a whole sector or country, these aren't as frequent or as devastating as news
    affecting individual stocks. And believe me, news is the biggest enemy of mean-reversion.

    play a part in promoting mean-reversion. Typically, weighting of a component stock
    increases with its market capitalization, though not necessarily linearly. Perhaps
    large-cap stocks are more prone to mean-reversion than small-cap stocks? But more
    intriguingly, can we not construct a basket of stocks, with custom-designed weightings,
    with the objective of optimizing its short-term mean-reversion property? I (and
    others before me) have done
