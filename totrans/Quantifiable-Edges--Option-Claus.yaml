- en: No doubt traders will hear about a possible “Santa Claus Rally” many times in
    the next few weeks. When looking at the S&P 500, though, I found the best week
    in December to be option expirations week. The edge has been especially pronounced
    over the last 24 years. During that period the market has closed the week higher
    about 81% of the time.
