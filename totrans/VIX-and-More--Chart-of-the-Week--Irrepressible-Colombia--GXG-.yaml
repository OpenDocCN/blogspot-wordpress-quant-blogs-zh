    in a fairly narrow trading range for the last 3 ½ months, those who are scanning
    the globe for investment ideas are likely to have seen an entirely different investment
    climate.

- en: A case in point is the Global X/InterBolsa FTSE Colombia 20 ETF ([GXG](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/GXG)),
    which has regularly been showing up as one of the top geography-based ETFs in
    my weekly [newsletter](http://vixandmoresubscriber.blogspot.com/). GXG is up 42%
    in 2010, handily outdistancing the [BRIC](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/BRIC)
    ETF, [EEB](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/GOOG), and the popular
    broad-based emerging markets ETF, [EEM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EEM),
    which are down -4.8% and -1.8% year-to-date, respectively.

    investment theme for the past few years due to the popularity of [Brazil](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Brazil)
    ([EWZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EWZ)), [Russia](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Russia)
    ([RSX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/RSX)), [India](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/India)
    ([EPI](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EPI)) and [China](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/China)
    ([FXI](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/FXI)), some have suggested
    that the current decade may turn out to be the decade of so-called [frontier ETFs](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/frontier%20ETFs),
    with countries like Colombia, Indonesia ([IDX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/IDX)),
    Vietnam ([VNM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VNM)), Egypt ([EGPT](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EGPT)),
    Turkey ([TUR](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TUR)) and South Africa
    ([EZA](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EZA)) among the top performers.
    These frontier ETFs already have their own catchy acronym, [CIVETS,](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/CIVETS)
    in order to make them easier to recall.

    countries, but when it comes to returns, the CIVETS are already off and running.
    With the best performance of any country ETF so far in 2010, Colombia has been
    acting like the new lead dog and has earned the spotlight as this week’s [chart
    of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week).
