- en: The gold standard was a key factor behind the Great Depression, but why did
    it produce such an intense worldwide deflation and associated economic contraction?
    While the tightening of U.S. monetary policy in 1928 is often blamed for having
    initiated the downturn, France increased its share of world gold reserves from
    7 percent to 27 percent between 1927 and 1932 and effectively sterilized most
    of this accumulation. This “gold hoarding” created an artificial shortage of reserves
    and put other countries under enormous deflationary pressure. Counterfactual simulations
    indicate that world prices would have increased slightly between 1929 and 1933,
    instead of declining calamitously, if the historical relationship between world
    gold reserves and world prices had continued. The results indicate that France
    was somewhat more to blame than the United States for the worldwide deflation
    of 1929-33\. The deflation could have been avoided if central banks had simply
    maintained their 1928 cover ratios.

    Council, according to economist David Malpass, who quotes Mr. Greenspan in one
    of Mr. Malpass’ emails on the political economy. Mr. Malpass writes that the former
    chairman of the Federal Reserve’s board of governors was responding to a question
    in respect of why gold was hitting new highs.

    and decided the supply and demand explanations treating gold like other commodities
    “simply don’t pan out,” as Mr. Malpass characterized Mr. Greenspan. “He’d concluded
    that gold is simply different,” Mr. Malpass wrote. At one point Mr. Greenspan
    spoke of how, during World War II, the Allies going into North Africa found gold
    was insisted on in the payment of bribes. Said the former Fed chairman: “If all
    currencies are moving up or down together, the question is: relative to what?
    Gold is the canary in the coal mine. It signals problems with respect to currency
    markets. Central banks should pay attention to it.”'
