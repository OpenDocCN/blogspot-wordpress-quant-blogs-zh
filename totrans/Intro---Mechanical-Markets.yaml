    been fascinated by markets’ capacity to be examined analytically since I was a
    kid and it was out of interest that I started working seriously on a trading company
    shortly after I finished school. Because there’s so little public information
    out there, anybody wanting to study market micro and meso-structure probably has
    no choice but to become a practitioner. I think many young people enter this profession
    for intellectual reasons (though I’m sure the money helps). They, and anybody
    else with similar curiosity, are my intended audience.

    there are lots of details that take time to understand, but I think a pretty large
    chunk of what I’ve learned over the last four years can be qualitatively communicated
    with just a few examples. Some examples of market inefficiencies are so simple
    that it’s a sad sign of the industry’s intense secrecy that they can be made into
    workable strategies. In most other technical businesses there is enough of a public
    discourse for interested parties to satisfy themselves without spending years
    of their time participating. While I won’t be able to share everything, I hope
    that my experiences are useful to people considering this career for the same
    reason I was. My younger self would certainly have appreciated even the few days
    of reading material I’d like to provide.
