    speculative. We certainly cannot rule out a further advance, but the basis for
    expecting one is currently weak. Better internals, higher quality leadership,
    broader sponsorship, and needless to say, a credible foreclosure abatement plan,
    would all be helpful "legs" if this advance is to be durable. For now, we don't
    observe enough of that evidence.

    committing new funds to the long side over the short term.
