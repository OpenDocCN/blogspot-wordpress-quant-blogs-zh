    of daily MR, this post will observe first order autocorrelation. From [wiki](http://wikipedia.org/):
    “Autocorrelation is the cross-correlation of a signal with itself. Informally,
    it is the similarity between observations as a function of the time separation
    between them.” Basically, it is the extent to which series values are correlated
    with previous values (aka lagged values) in the same series. For example, the
    first order autocorrelation of a daily logarithmic return series is the correlation
    between two subsets of the return series; the series as is with a look back period
    and the same subset lagged 1 period.'

    in a market regime indicator, or more globally in a trading system. It is also
    interesting to see the evolution of autocorrelation in a given asset. The figure
    below shows the equity curve of the S&P 500 since 1957, the rolling Sharpe ratio
    of a daily MR strategy (RSI 2 50/50) and finally the first order correlation of
    the S&P logarithmic return using a rolling 2 years look back period.

    performance. When autocorrelation is positive, daily follow through is more profitable
    than mean reversion, around the turn of the century however, autocorrelation switched
    to negative territory, which is consistent with the MR predominance in profitable
    directional swing strategies as very well explained in the blogs on my blogroll.
    I plan to post a more number intensive note soon, this was just a post to introduce
    autocorrelation as a valuable moderator of daily MR.
