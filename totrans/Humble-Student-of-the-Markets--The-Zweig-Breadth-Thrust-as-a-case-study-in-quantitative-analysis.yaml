    response to the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH). EMH proponent believed that
    you can't beat the market with stock picking because everything about a stock
    is already known by the market.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As a test of EMH, researchers began to scour the CRSP tapes of stock prices
    and found "anomalies". They found that you could beat the market with well diversified
    portfolios of small cap stocks, stocks with low P/B, low P/E and so on. Thus quantitative
    analysis was born.

    breadth being one of the best tools we have to indicate financial market liquidity.
    But based on this evidence, I cannot offer much in the way of optimistic commentary
    about this current ZBT signal, especially since it has occurred at a point that
    appears to be the early stage of a new downtrend. Robust rallies within downtrends
    are great opportunities to get ready for the next phase of the downtrend. The
    problem is that they often disguise themselves that way, when in reality a new
    uptrend is beginning after a long bear market. This current moment does not seem
    like the end of a long bear market just yet.

    torture, users of the research don't have that luxury. However, research users
    can try to understand what a model is really telling them by perturbing the rules
    to see how the results vary. In the case of the ZBT, we are further hampered by
    the low number of observations. There are very few instances of ZBTs, so it is
    equally important to dive into the data to really understand what it is telling
    us.

    readings appear to be inconsistent with the observed readings derived from their
    own EMA calculations. Consider this chart of the most recent signal. Note how
    the ZBT flag (top panel) went negative as a setup signal, followed by the buy
    signal shortly afterwards. This can be confirmed by the EMA moving below 0.40
    and rising above 0.615 in the bottom panel.

    we rely on ZBT to take action in our portfolios. My conclusion, which agrees with
    Rob Hanna, is that the stock market tends to rise after ZBT buy signals. At worse,
    stocks didn't go up, so a long position really doesn't hurt you very much. The
    poor ZBT returns from the 1930's represent a market environment from a long-ago
    era that may not be applicable today and therefore those results should be discounted.
