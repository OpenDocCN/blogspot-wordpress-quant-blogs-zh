    more time thinking about the assumptions behind their models (see my recent posts

    Group at Morgan Stanley. Candidates must have demonstrated excellence in mathematics,
    programming, statistics and Quantitative modelers must have a background which
    would enable them to develop models that would positively impact the revenue-generating
    capabilities of their trader counterparts.

    this job description seems to call for a junior or intermediate level quant (3-5
    years experience). I hope that this isn’t a case of the blind leading the blind
    and there are people in the firm with the sufficient maturity and “grey hair”
    to lead the group and understand the nuances of modeling.
