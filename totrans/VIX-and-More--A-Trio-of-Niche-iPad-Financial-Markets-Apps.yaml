    there are several which defy easy categorization or appear to be the only entrants
    in their respective categories. Today I look at three such apps:'

    on a specific niche of the investing world.

    ETFdb news articles. The screener is somewhat basic and the articles appear in
    chronological order, what it makes it difficult to keep track of specific sectors
    or asset classes in real-time. Still, when one drills down from the screening
    tool, some excellent ETF (and ETN) content is unveiled. The profile pages (see
    graphic below) include eight separate tabs that are filled with information, including
    data on holdings, fund performance, charts, technical analysis details, related
    news, and a link to the issuer home page, where one can generally find a prospectus,
    dividend information and other details. In short, ETFdb is an excellent tool for
    researching individual ETFs, though its screening and news functionality could
    use some enhancements.'

    includes general market data (indices, most active stocks, most active options,
    etc.), quotes, news and a watchlist function where users can pull up options chains
    and access data and charts for every option associated with a particular underlying.
    The CBOE app also has some high quality educational content from the Options Institute.
    Here one can learn the basics of options strategies, take an online course or
    review a variety of additional educational materials from the CBOE’s educational
    arm. CBOE TV content is also available on the app. These include videos on breaking
    news and timely subjects as well as more general background material. Last but
    not least, the CBOE app has a link to the CBOE twitter feed, which highlights
    significant options transactions, breaking news and new content on the

    the three apps. This is partly because it had been awhile since I visited the

    and display. A self-styled “computational knowledge engine,” think of WolframAlpha
    as Wikipedia on steroids (lots of them), tied to a world class mathematical brain
    that effortlessly conveys the nuances of complex subjects with the help of an
    extremely deft use of statistics and graphics. Yes, it is an elegant nerd. Type
    in “VIX’ at the web site or in the iPad and you can quickly see what VIX is all
    about. Try “iron condor option” and you can quickly visualize and internalize
    much of what that strategy is all about. Tickers work too, though not all of them.

    above and in previous posts, the iPad version of WolframAlpha is not free, but
    for $1.99 I have little doubt that users will find a way to get their money’s
    worth out of this application.

    universe and do so in an attractive manner. Investors interested in ETFs, options
    or computational data and graphics are encouraged to take each of these three
    apps for a test drive.
