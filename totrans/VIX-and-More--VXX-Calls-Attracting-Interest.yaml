- en: Since their [launch](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/05/cboe-launches-options-on-vxx-and-vxz.html)
    just two months ago, options on the iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN ([VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX))
    have attracted a robust following and have averaged about 20,000 contracts per
    day. During that period, approximately 2/3 of the [VXX options](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX%20options)
    transactions have involved calls.

    call volume last Tuesday and again today, as the Livevol chart below shows. Perhaps
    more importantly, call transactions as a percentage of all options transactions
    has spiked to a new all-time high of 78%, indicating that investors have become
    increasingly insistent that volatility is due for a rise.

    12-week low.

    respectively, the gap in the [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures)
    used to calculate VXX has jumped to 3.20, reflecting a strong [contango](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/contango)
    rip tide (the “headwind” metaphor has a vacation day today…) and substantial daily
    negative [roll yield](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/roll%20yield).

- en: Looking at the chart, previous instances of VXX call spikes (green columns at
    bottom) have tended to coincide with tops in VXX. If the smart money is piling
    into long VXX calls this time around, it looks as if they are already underwater.
    With implied volatility just under 65, time decay is at least as much of a threat
    to long VXX calls as contango. The chart patterns have me wondering if there is
    a little desperation in the air that may be triggering some [revenge trades](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2z1qMnUl2s&feature=related)
    in VXX.
