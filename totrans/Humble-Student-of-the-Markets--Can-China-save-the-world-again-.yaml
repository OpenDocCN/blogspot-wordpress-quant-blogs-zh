    violent collapse and lost a further 5 per cent before global markets regained
    their feet in mid-November.

    Tokyo’s fall was mild compared with those in the US, Europe and elsewhere in Asia
    – where some bourses plunged as much as 40 per cent. By the spring of 1988 the
    Nikkei was back up to a 15-year high, from which it would continue soaring for
    another 20 months.

    turbulent weeks that followed the October crash. Mr Monji, then a dealer at Daiwa

    ordered by their regulators in the Finance Ministry not to sell into the panic
    – an act of intervention that “would be inconceivable today”, notes Mr Monji.

    outlook, low interest rates and a rising yen probably played a bigger role. The
    market’s structure helped: two-thirds of all company shares were held not by profit-seeking
    investors but by allied companies seeking to cement business ties.'
