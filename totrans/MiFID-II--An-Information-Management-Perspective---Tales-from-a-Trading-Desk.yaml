    [reading](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2178944).  “simulate,
    monitor and calibrate” comes though loud and clear.

    with the globalisation and competitive environment of the financial markets has
    increased the complexity and dynamics of markets making them difficult to understand
    and has raised a number of issues in relation to the adequacy and appropriateness
    of the regulatory frameworks.

    Computer Trading in Financial Markets in relation to the costs, risks and benefits
    of the possible regulatory measures which are currently being considered as part
    of the European Union’s Markets in Financial Instruments Directive 2, also known
    as MiFID II.

    of the issues that need to be examined, the measures discussed can be seen as
    fine-tuning actions that might have a higher risk of unintended consequences and
    domino effects, and it is better to re-examine financial markets from ground-up
    and be prepared to make suggestions and recommendations based on experience from
    related domains and intuition rather than evidence based only on peer review research.

    financial markets and identify a number of areas that need to be examined by drawing
    parallels with other man-made systems that we believe provide useful insights.
    Finally, the report attempts to contribute to a wider understanding of the issues
    that financial markets currently face and help with their understanding and regulatory
    measures that could be examined.
