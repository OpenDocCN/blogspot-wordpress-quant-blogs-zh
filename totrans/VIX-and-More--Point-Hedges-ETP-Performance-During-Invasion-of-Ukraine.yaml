- en: On Friday in [Flight-to-Safety ETP Performance During Invasion of Ukraine](https://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2022/03/flight-to-safety-etp-performance-during.html),
    I reviewed the performance of some of the traditional flight-to-safety ETPs (Treasuries,
    gold, currencies and volatility) that are often used to hedge an equity-centric
    portfolio.

- en: Evaluating the performance of these ETPs since [Russia](https://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Russia)
    invaded [Ukraine](https://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Ukraine) a little
    over a month ago, I found some rather lackluster numbers.  As a group, these products
    have not even broken even since the invasion of Ukraine.

- en: This time around, I have elected to look at the performance of some less traditional
    ETPs, including some much more targeted products that I have referred to in the
    past as “[point hedges](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/point%20hedge).” 
    Specifically, I looked at areas where exports from Russia and Ukraine are a significant
    portion of the global export market and whose disruption could have a significant
    impact on the global balance of supply and demand.  As it turns out, these commodities
    were easy to identify and the price dislocations have generally dwarfed the appreciation
    one might have been able to realize with more traditional hedges.

    should be on this list, but in part due to some chaos and mismanagement at the
    London Metal Exchange, JJN prices jumped have had multiple spikes of more than
    100% and dwarf the performance of other ETPs in this graphic.  Additionally, for
    the international crude oil market, Brent crude oil ([BNO](https://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/BNO))
    is typically a better measure than USO, but since the  Russian invasion of Ukraine,
    the two ETPs have only differed in performance by about 2%.]'

    is easy to pick the winners, but anyone who studied Ukraine’s biggest contributions
    to the global export market could have deduced that a supply shortage in wheat
    and corn was likely and for Russia, natural gas, crude oil and nickel were three
    areas of high risk in terms of their strategic value to the West, with wheat and
    corn also part of the equation.  I threw in aerospace & defense as a general military
    hedge.

- en: Unlike the inconsistent and largely negative performance of more traditional
    flight-to-safety ETPs since the Russian invasion, the point hedges above have
    all seen gains of at least 3% during this period – and if you remove aerospace
    & defense from the mix, all the gains are at least 6.8% or higher.

- en: This is not to say that more narrow point hedges will usually outperform the
    broader traditional hedges during periods of geopolitical turmoil, but rather
    to remind readers that instead of a more generic hedge, a targeted hedge or speculative
    trade often has the potential to deliver substantially greater returns, such as
    the median 13% returns from the group of ETPs above.

    Russia and Ukraine that each of these point hedges is exposed to the potential
    of a significant decline in price.
