    the coast still matters immensely. In fact, there are only two prosperous landlocked
    countries of any size: Austria and Switzerland.'

    Kong, Finland. None are geographically rich, but the people are. Winston Churchill
    and his friends raved about the wealth of Africa, as Uganda and Kenya have fertile
    lands, lots of minerals ... and they are economic wastelands now.

    landlocked countries (Aus and Switz). The other 13 countries are prosperous, and
    have coasts, but it is not their coastliness that matters. Adopting free market
    policies, avoiding blatantly corrupt governments, is key (unlike the subtly corrupt
    Western governments). The problem with Zimbabwe or Uzbekistan is not their lack
    of regattas.

    America, which is dirt poor. South America has 13 countries, and the 2 landlocked
    ones are poor, but so are most of their countries on the coast, and with only
    2, the standard error on this pattern is large. Most landlocked countries are
    either in Africa, or ex-communist states, and that's the real pattern, not water.
    But then that's not very interesting, because the problems of Africa, and the
    ex-Soviet satellites are pretty different.

    is easier to go through than a heavily defended terrain. That's why you go through
    the Ardennes forest and not the Maginot line. It's people and the things they
    create that matter, not geography.
