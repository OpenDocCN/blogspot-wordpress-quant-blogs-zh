    broke, and that last week enough things “broke” that they finally blinked.

    dire picture of global asset returns this year.

    global financial community nah-nah-nah-we-can’t-hear-you-we’re-going-to-keep-raising-come-hell-or-high-water,
    but the economic and financial market weakness that was previously confined to
    the rest of the world, has finally come to America. The Federal Reserve is now
    very close to being on hold for the indefinite future. Sure, they will probably
    raise once more this December, but it’s most likely a one-and-done. Or at very
    least, much more a one-and-we-will-see.

    in American stocks and shooting every other asset class, it’s probably time to
    do the opposite. Buy emerging markets. Sell U.S. dollars. Play for a steepener
    in the American yield curve. Buy commodities.
