    one month ago, when the average insider was behaving quite bullishly. ( Read [my
    Nov. 21 column, “Insider behavior points to imminent rally.”](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/insider-behavior-points-to-imminent-rally-2012-11-21)

    a return of that magnitude in one month’s time is nothing to sneeze at, is that
    really enough of a rise to justify such a big shift in insider behavior? Either
    something has led them to change their minds about their companies’ longer-term
    prospects, or they have become short-term traders like the rest of the market.

    yet. Explanation #2 is a perfectly plausible reason for the rash of insider activity
    as 2012 draws to a close. In that case, I would wait for the insider activity
    data in January to see if insiders are indeed selling because of deteriorating
    corporate fundamentals, or for tax related reasons.'
