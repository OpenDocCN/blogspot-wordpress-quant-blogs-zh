    a return of that magnitude in one month’s time is nothing to sneeze at, is that
    really enough of a rise to justify such a big shift in insider behavior? Either
    something has led them to change their minds about their companies’ longer-term
    prospects, or they have become short-term traders like the rest of the market.
