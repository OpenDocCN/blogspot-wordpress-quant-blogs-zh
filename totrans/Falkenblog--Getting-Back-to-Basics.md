At least he understands what they have been doing.  If he's serious, why not start by selling the bank off into manageable parts?  I just don't see how its possible to efficiently maximize a 2 trillion dollar bank, with 260k employees. The only people this makes sense for are senior management and politicians, as its become the new Fannie Mae, a great way to give bureaucrats a multi-million dollar payouts in thanks for regulations that hurt competition under the rubric of safety.
