    Looking at instances going back to 1986 in which the OEX (the S&P 100 index, which

    stays below 30%, what was bad gets worse. In every prior instance where VXO failed
    to climb to above 30%, the market continued lower. The MINIMUM additional downside
    is another 10%.”*'

    profile noted above, but the correlation between the level of the VXO when the
    10% OEX decline is met and the extent of the subsequent decline over all 14 data
    points in the study is also worth pondering. Read the full article at
