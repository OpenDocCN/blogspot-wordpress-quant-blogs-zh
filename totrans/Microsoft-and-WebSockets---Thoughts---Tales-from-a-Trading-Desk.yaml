    recently – [MIX11](http://channel9.msdn.com/events/mix/mix11/HTM10) onwards. Paul’s
    [posting](http://www.paulbatum.com/) on MIX11 provides details of the source code
    available from the Microsoft labs.

    W3C WebSockets API Spec – which is positive news. It’s however unfortunate that
    a majority of the Microsoft Silverlight push data application developed within
    financial services over the last few years are all powered by Java push servers.

    who tells me that STAC Research are in the early stages of developing a “last
    mile” push benchmark spec. Hopefully [Microsoft](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/interoperability/archive/2011/03/09/latest-websockets-release-interoperates-with-eclipse-s-jetty.aspx)
    will consider benchmarking their WebSockets implementation along with the various
    other vendors in this space such as Kaazing, my-Channels, Caplin, Lightstreamer,
    Migratory, Solace Systems etc

- en: 'Final thoughts: I guess given the feature set of [Azure](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsazure/AppFabric/Overview/default.aspx)
    Service Bus, if I happen to implement [“Trading in the Cloud”](https://mdavey.wordpress.com/2009/02/02/trading-in-the-cloud/),
    I end up having to bridge WebSockets to Service Bus myself (think streaming prices)?
    Surely Microsoft would have been better to extend Azure Service Bus to support
    WebSockets?'
