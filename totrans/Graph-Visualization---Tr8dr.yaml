- en: I am looking for a good application or library for graph (as in network) visualization.
     I need to be able to visualize very large graphs so the static graph rendering
    approach does not work.   Want something dynamic where can focus on local context
    while navigating the graph.  Something a bit more sophisticated than [this](http://www.neuroproductions.be/twitter_friends_network_browser/)
    for instance.    I’d like to have a notion of weight and direction on the graph.
      Ideally should be able to take graphml as input.

    as a basis for interactive exploration.   Perhaps too much work for my busy schedule.
     There are a number of examples that give me ideas for other visualizations.

    a dynamic graphing technology.  It was flash based at the time.  Now it looks
    like they are using Java.   Strangely, their java UI is much inferior to their
    prior flash API.

    code is actionscript based.   Hmm, don’t want to go there.

    package for R that provides a R interface to rendering with Protoviz (amongst
    other web based renderers).   Looks like it is just what I need (thanks)!   Protoviz
    requires some programming, however the level of abstraction seems about right
    for something this flexible.**
