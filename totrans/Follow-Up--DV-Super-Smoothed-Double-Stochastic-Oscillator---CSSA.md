Hi Dave,
I am an ETF rewind subscriber and came across your highly informative web site. Somewhere on your site (i forget where), you mentioned that you can share the calculation or code for some of the indicators, including DV Sto oscillator, that you’ve created. I’d like to get them into tradestation and test them with some of the strategies i’ve created. Thanks very much in advance, Ray
