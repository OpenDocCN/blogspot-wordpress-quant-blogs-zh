    that, if you can tie yourself to some intellectual mast and bear this psychic
    pain you should expect a higher return. There is a mistaken syllogism at the bottom
    of portfolio theory, as just because you have to take risk to get rich, or if
    you take risk you might get rich, this does not mean if you take risk you will
    become richer on average.'

    funds in some blind risky trust at a young age, if they could then know with statistical
    certainty this would maximize their wealth at retirement. If this were so investing
    would be a lot simpler. Also, think about other distasteful activities, such as
    cleaning septic tanks. Indeed, Keynes compared risk taking to working in 'smelly'
    occupations, noting such activity would require a premium. Yet septic tank work
    does not pay really well, and the Untouchables in India have long had a monopoly
    on cleaning sewers manually without much compensation.

    of males passed on their genes. The rest of the males have been genetic dead ends.
    Historically a female could play it safe because there were always men willing
    to impregnate them, whereas a male who remained meek was elbowed out of sexual
    trysts. Males have to beat out other men to get access to females. Thus, men built
    ships and traveled to far-off lands because those were the guys who had more children,
    whereas a bunch of women could bear children just as easily staying put. Everyone's
    male ancestors have been disproportionately bold risk takers; not taking risk,
    over generations, is certain doom. We take risk, therefore, because not taking
    risk is genetic suicide, at least for the gender that generally takes such risks.

    our instincts are not shaped by the welfare state. Men are driven to take risks,
    improvising, which is why we see so much greater jazz improvisation by men, or
    risk taking in any area. Baumeister states it isn't the ability, so much as the
    drive to excel that leads them to create technological and cultural achievements.

- en: Risk taking is the best way to find your comparative advantage, your alpha,
    because something you do well is something that requires more than just doing
    what anyone else can do, by definition. You need to take a risk not merely to
    inform yourself of some specialized competence, but to signal to others you would
    be a good person to assume greater responsibility in that area. Organizations
    are always looking for the best people for parochial tasks, and those who have
    demonstrated competence via successful risk-taking are prime candidates.

- en: Risk takers dominate our lives via their disproportionate effect on our genes,
    and their influence on our technology and culture. They did not become successful,
    however, merely by taking some abstract 'risk' that is the same for everyone,
    and then enjoy the higher rewards that come with it. They instead took the right
    risks, those consistent with their unique strengths, and reaped rewards consistent
    with mastery of something important. Like a golfer with a long drive, you should
    risk a shot at the green as opposed to laying up, but only because you can hit
    the ball farther than most.

  zh: 冒险者通过他们对我们的基因、技术和文化的不成比例的影响统治着我们的生活。然而，他们并不是仅仅通过承担每个人都一样的抽象的'风险'并享受与此相关的更高回报而变得成功的。他们相反是冒了正确的风险，与他们独特优势一致的风险，并获得了与掌握重要事情一致的回报。就像一个可以推出球更远的高尔夫球手，你应该冒险尝试推向果岭，而不是放缓，但仅仅因为你能比大多数人打得更远。
- en: Modern finance is profoundly misleading when it suggests that reward is merely
    a function of our ability to withstand some abstruse risk (ie, the covariance
    with the as-yet-unidentified stochastic discount factor), and chance. Skill, effort,
    and learning play no part in this sterile world. In contrast, people should see
    risk taking as a process of self-discovery, of becoming the best you can be, and
    that playing it safe is, for males at least, a path of oblivion. The payoffs to
    risk-taking are partially chance, but if you want to take risks intelligently
    you will gravitate towards risks consistent with your skills, and get better and
    better at them. If some risk demands nothing of you, merely jumping at it is surely
    foolhardy because risks do not generate higher-than-average-returns as a general
    rule, and suggests whoever is selling this opportunity is a modern snake-oil salesman.

  zh: 当现代金融暗示回报仅仅是我们能够承受一些晦涩风险（即与尚未识别的随机贴现因子的协方差）和机会的函数时，现代金融是极具误导性的。技能、努力和学习在这种贫瘠世界中没有起作用。相反，人们应该将冒险视为一个自我发现的过程，成为你能成为的最好的自己，并且对于至少男性来说，保守是一条通向遗忘的道路。冒险的回报部分是机会，但如果你想要聪明地冒险，你将会向与你的技能一致的风险靠拢，并变得越来越擅长于它们。如果某种风险对你根本不构成挑战，仅仅冒险是愚蠢的，因为风险通常不会产生高于平均水平的回报，这暗示着推销这一机会的人是一个现代江湖郎中。
