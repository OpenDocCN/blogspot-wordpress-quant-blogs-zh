    that, if you can tie yourself to some intellectual mast and bear this psychic
    pain you should expect a higher return. There is a mistaken syllogism at the bottom
    of portfolio theory, as just because you have to take risk to get rich, or if
    you take risk you might get rich, this does not mean if you take risk you will
    become richer on average.'

    funds in some blind risky trust at a young age, if they could then know with statistical
    certainty this would maximize their wealth at retirement. If this were so investing
    would be a lot simpler. Also, think about other distasteful activities, such as
    cleaning septic tanks. Indeed, Keynes compared risk taking to working in 'smelly'
    occupations, noting such activity would require a premium. Yet septic tank work
    does not pay really well, and the Untouchables in India have long had a monopoly
    on cleaning sewers manually without much compensation.

    of males passed on their genes. The rest of the males have been genetic dead ends.
    Historically a female could play it safe because there were always men willing
    to impregnate them, whereas a male who remained meek was elbowed out of sexual
    trysts. Males have to beat out other men to get access to females. Thus, men built
    ships and traveled to far-off lands because those were the guys who had more children,
    whereas a bunch of women could bear children just as easily staying put. Everyone's
    male ancestors have been disproportionately bold risk takers; not taking risk,
    over generations, is certain doom. We take risk, therefore, because not taking
    risk is genetic suicide, at least for the gender that generally takes such risks.

    our instincts are not shaped by the welfare state. Men are driven to take risks,
    improvising, which is why we see so much greater jazz improvisation by men, or
    risk taking in any area. Baumeister states it isn't the ability, so much as the
    drive to excel that leads them to create technological and cultural achievements.

    because something you do well is something that requires more than just doing
    what anyone else can do, by definition. You need to take a risk not merely to
    inform yourself of some specialized competence, but to signal to others you would
    be a good person to assume greater responsibility in that area. Organizations
    are always looking for the best people for parochial tasks, and those who have
    demonstrated competence via successful risk-taking are prime candidates.

    and their influence on our technology and culture. They did not become successful,
    however, merely by taking some abstract 'risk' that is the same for everyone,
    and then enjoy the higher rewards that come with it. They instead took the right
    risks, those consistent with their unique strengths, and reaped rewards consistent
    with mastery of something important. Like a golfer with a long drive, you should
    risk a shot at the green as opposed to laying up, but only because you can hit
    the ball farther than most.

    a function of our ability to withstand some abstruse risk (ie, the covariance
    with the as-yet-unidentified stochastic discount factor), and chance. Skill, effort,
    and learning play no part in this sterile world. In contrast, people should see
    risk taking as a process of self-discovery, of becoming the best you can be, and
    that playing it safe is, for males at least, a path of oblivion. The payoffs to
    risk-taking are partially chance, but if you want to take risks intelligently
    you will gravitate towards risks consistent with your skills, and get better and
    better at them. If some risk demands nothing of you, merely jumping at it is surely
    foolhardy because risks do not generate higher-than-average-returns as a general
    rule, and suggests whoever is selling this opportunity is a modern snake-oil salesman.
