    that, if you can tie yourself to some intellectual mast and bear this psychic
    pain you should expect a higher return. There is a mistaken syllogism at the bottom

  zh: ，通常是不会得到补偿的。没有简单的冒险形式，如果你能够把自己绑在某种认知的高处并承受精神上的痛苦，你就能期待更高的回报。投资组合理论的底层存在一个错误的三段论，因为你必须冒险才能致富，或者如果你冒险你可能致富，这并不意味着你冒险就能更富裕。
- en: In some aspect, this is obvious. A lot of people would be willing to put their
    funds in some blind risky trust at a young age, if they could then know with statistical
    certainty this would maximize their wealth at retirement. If this were so investing
    would be a lot simpler. Also, think about other distasteful activities, such as
    cleaning septic tanks. Indeed, Keynes compared risk taking to working in 'smelly'
    occupations, noting such activity would require a premium. Yet septic tank work
    does not pay really well, and the Untouchables in India have long had a monopoly
    on cleaning sewers manually without much compensation.

  zh: 在某些方面，这是显而易见的。很多人在年轻的时候会愿意把自己的资金投入到一些盲目的冒险信托中，如果他们可以以统计学的确定性知道这会使他们在退休时财富最大化。如果是这样的话，投资就会简单得多。还要考虑其他令人不快的活动，比如清理化粪池。事实上，凯恩斯把冒险比作在“臭气熏天”的职业中工作，指出这样的活动会需要额外的报酬。然而，清理化粪池的工作并没有真的报酬很高，长久以来，印度的贱民一直垄断着手动清理下水道的工作而没有得到太多补偿。

- en: . He notes that historically 80% of females have reproduced, while only 40%
    of males passed on their genes. The rest of the males have been genetic dead ends.
    Historically a female could play it safe because there were always men willing
    to impregnate them, whereas a male who remained meek was elbowed out of sexual
    trysts. Males have to beat out other men to get access to females. Thus, men built
    ships and traveled to far-off lands because those were the guys who had more children,
    whereas a bunch of women could bear children just as easily staying put. Everyone's
    male ancestors have been disproportionately bold risk takers; not taking risk,
    over generations, is certain doom. We take risk, therefore, because not taking
    risk is genetic suicide, at least for the gender that generally takes such risks.

  zh: . 他指出，历史上有80%的女性繁衍后代，而只有40%的男性传承了他们的基因。其余的男性成为了遗传的死胡同。在历史上，女性可以选择保守行事，因为总有男性愿意让她们怀孕，而留下来的男性通常会在性交中失败。男性必须战胜其他男性才能接近女性。因此，男性建造船只，远行他乡，因为那些男性有更多的子女，而一群女性待在原地也可以轻松生育。所有的男性祖先都是极具冒险精神的；在一代又一代之间，不冒险就是注定灭亡的。因此，我们冒险，因为不冒险就是遗传上的自杀，至少对通常愿意冒这种险的性别来说是这样。
- en: Currently selection is not so pressing, perhaps even opposite to our past, but
    our instincts are not shaped by the welfare state. Men are driven to take risks,
    improvising, which is why we see so much greater jazz improvisation by men, or
    risk taking in any area. Baumeister states it isn't the ability, so much as the
    drive to excel that leads them to create technological and cultural achievements.

  zh: 目前的选择并不是那么紧迫，甚至可能与我们的过去背道而驰，但我们的本能并不是由福利国家塑造的。男人驱使着他们去冒险、即兴创作，这也是为什么我们看到这么多男性在爵士乐中即兴演奏，或在任何领域冒险。鲍迈斯特说这并非是能力，而是追求卓越的动力，促使他们创造科技和文化成就。
- en: Risk taking is the best way to find your comparative advantage, your alpha,
    because something you do well is something that requires more than just doing
    what anyone else can do, by definition. You need to take a risk not merely to
    inform yourself of some specialized competence, but to signal to others you would
    be a good person to assume greater responsibility in that area. Organizations
    are always looking for the best people for parochial tasks, and those who have
    demonstrated competence via successful risk-taking are prime candidates.

  zh: 冒险是发现你的比较优势、你的alpha最佳方式，因为你做得很好的事情是需要不仅仅是任何其他人都可以做的，根据定义。你需要冒险不仅仅是为了告诉自己一些专业能力，而是向他人传达你是在该领域承担更大责任的合适人选。组织一直在寻找对特定任务最佳的人，那些通过成功冒险展现出能力的人是主要候选人。
- en: Risk takers dominate our lives via their disproportionate effect on our genes,
    and their influence on our technology and culture. They did not become successful,
    however, merely by taking some abstract 'risk' that is the same for everyone,
    and then enjoy the higher rewards that come with it. They instead took the right
    risks, those consistent with their unique strengths, and reaped rewards consistent
    with mastery of something important. Like a golfer with a long drive, you should
    risk a shot at the green as opposed to laying up, but only because you can hit
    the ball farther than most.

  zh: 冒险者通过他们对我们的基因、技术和文化的不成比例的影响统治着我们的生活。然而，他们并不是仅仅通过承担每个人都一样的抽象的'风险'并享受与此相关的更高回报而变得成功的。他们相反是冒了正确的风险，与他们独特优势一致的风险，并获得了与掌握重要事情一致的回报。就像一个可以推出球更远的高尔夫球手，你应该冒险尝试推向果岭，而不是放缓，但仅仅因为你能比大多数人打得更远。
- en: Modern finance is profoundly misleading when it suggests that reward is merely
    a function of our ability to withstand some abstruse risk (ie, the covariance
    with the as-yet-unidentified stochastic discount factor), and chance. Skill, effort,
    and learning play no part in this sterile world. In contrast, people should see
    risk taking as a process of self-discovery, of becoming the best you can be, and
    that playing it safe is, for males at least, a path of oblivion. The payoffs to
    risk-taking are partially chance, but if you want to take risks intelligently
    you will gravitate towards risks consistent with your skills, and get better and
    better at them. If some risk demands nothing of you, merely jumping at it is surely
    foolhardy because risks do not generate higher-than-average-returns as a general
    rule, and suggests whoever is selling this opportunity is a modern snake-oil salesman.

  zh: 当现代金融暗示回报仅仅是我们能够承受一些晦涩风险（即与尚未识别的随机贴现因子的协方差）和机会的函数时，现代金融是极具误导性的。技能、努力和学习在这种贫瘠世界中没有起作用。相反，人们应该将冒险视为一个自我发现的过程，成为你能成为的最好的自己，并且对于至少男性来说，保守是一条通向遗忘的道路。冒险的回报部分是机会，但如果你想要聪明地冒险，你将会向与你的技能一致的风险靠拢，并变得越来越擅长于它们。如果某种风险对你根本不构成挑战，仅仅冒险是愚蠢的，因为风险通常不会产生高于平均水平的回报，这暗示着推销这一机会的人是一个现代江湖郎中。
