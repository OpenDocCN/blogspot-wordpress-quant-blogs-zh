# Humble Student of the Markets: The start of a new Trump bull?

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2016/11/the-start-of-new-trump-bull.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2016/11/the-start-of-new-trump-bull.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models**

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post,

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The

**Trend Model**

is an asset allocation model which applies trend following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or contraction (bearish)?"

My inner trader uses the

**trading component**

of the Trend Model to look for changes in direction of the main Trend Model signal. A bullish Trend Model signal that gets less bullish is a trading "sell" signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading "buy" signal. The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. Past trading of the trading model has shown turnover rates of about 200% per month.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Buy equities*
*   Trend Model signal: Risk-on*
*   Trading model: Bearish (downgrade)*

*The performance chart and model readings have been delayed by a week out of respect to our paying subscribers.* **Update schedule**

: I generally update model readings on my

on weekends and tweet mid-week observations at @humblestudent. Subscribers will also receive email notices of any changes in my trading portfolio.

**Market is following my road map**

Last week, perennially bullish strategist

[Tom Lee](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/25/tom-lee-trump-could-bring-major-bull-market-here-is-what-i-am-buying.html)

appeared on CNBC and stated that the Trump win could produce a major bull market. While it is true that stock prices have rallied significantly since the election, the fundamental underpinnings of the advance were not mainly attributable to Trump's win, notwithstanding the change in psychology.

Many of the reasons for the stock market gains were already baked in before the election. Consider, for example, the better growth outlook. The chart below shows the evolution of the

[NY Fed's nowcast](https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/policy/nowcast.html)

of Q4 GDP growth, which shows an upward acceleration in Q4 growth. Those factors were already in place well before the election, regardless of who won the White House.

In fact, the bull market seems to be following the script that I set out for it (see 

[The roadmap to a 2017 market top](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/08/27/the-roadmap-to-a-2017-market-top/)

):

1.  Rising growth expectations, which leads to...
2.  Higher inflation expectations, which leads to.
3.  Tighter monetary policy, which leads to...
4.  [Three steps and a stumble](https://mta.org/kb/three-steps-and-a-stumble/).

We are somewhere between Act 2 and Act 3 of that script.
