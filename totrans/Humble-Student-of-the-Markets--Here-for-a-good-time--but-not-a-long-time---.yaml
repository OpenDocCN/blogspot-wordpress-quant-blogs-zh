    bullish signals. First, the 5-day RSI, which is useful for swing trading short-term

    11, 2014) after hitting the lower Bollinger Band yesterday. An "inside day" occurs
    as when the daily range of a stock or index is inside the previous day's daily
    high-low range. According to Jamie Saettele at

    or lower Bollinger Band can be an indication of reversal. The Bollinger Band defines
    the overbought or oversold reading, while the inside day signals indecision or
    trend exhaustion (emphasis added):'

    Bollinger Band® are considered low. However, just because prices have hit the
    upper Bollinger does not necessarily mean that it is a good time to sell. Strong
    trends will 'ride' these bands and wipe out any trader attempting to buy the 'low'
    prices in a downtrend or sell the 'high' prices in an uptrend. Therefore, just
    buying at the lower band and selling at the upper band is out of the question.
    By definition, price makes new highs in an uptrend and new lows in a downtrend,
    which means that they will naturally be hitting the bands. With this information
    in mind, o***ur filter will require that buy signals occur only if the candle
    following the one that hits the Bollinger Band® does not make a new high or low.
    This type of candle is commonly known as an inside day.*** The best time frames
    to look for the inside days are daily charts, but this strategy can also be used
    on hourly, weekly and monthly charts. ***Combining inside days with Bollinger
    Bands® increases the likelihood that we are only picking a top or bottom after
    prices have hit extreme levels.*** As a rule of thumb, the longer the time frame,
    the rarer the trade will be, but the signal will also be more significant. (For

    market at a particular point in time. ***Specifically, the inside candle represents
    a period of contracted volatility. If, in an uptrend, volatility begins to slow
    and the market fails to make a new high (as illustrated by the inside candle),
    then we can deduce that strength is waning and that the chance for a reversal
    exists.*** When combined with a Bollinger Band®, we ensure that we are trading
    a reversal only by either selling high prices (higher Bollinger Band®) or buying
    low prices (lower Bollinger Band®). In this way, we trade for the big move; not
    necessarily selling the low tick or buying the bottom tick but definitely buying
    near the relative bottom and selling near the relative top. The key is confirmation.

    do not care about the level of equity prices, or bond yields or credit spreads
    per se. Instead, we focus on how financial market conditions influence the transmission
    of monetary policy to the real economy. At times, a large decline in equity prices
    will not be problematic for achieving our goals. For example, economic conditions
    may warrant a tightening of financial market conditions. If this happens mainly
    via the channel of equity price weakness—that is not a problem, as it does not
    conflict with our objectives. In contrast, when we want financial market conditions
    to be extremely accommodative—as has been the case in recent years when we have
    been far away from our employment and inflation objectives—then we will take into
    consideration a broad set of developments with respect to interest rates, the
    stock market and other measures of financial conditions in choosing the appropriate
    stance for monetary policy.
