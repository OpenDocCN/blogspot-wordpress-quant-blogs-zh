- en: For several years I have publishing a graphical overview of the [VIX ETPs](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20ETN)
    landscape, with all the ETPs plotted on the basis of leverage and target maturity,
    such as the recent [VIX ETP Returns for 2012](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2013/01/vix-etp-performance-in-2012.html).

    taking root in a space that is closer to the VIX products than any of the other
    ETPs. I talked about the low volatility ETPs at some length in yesterday’s [Beyond
    SPLV: The Expanding Universe of Low Volatility ETPs](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2013/02/beyond-splv-expanding-universe-of-low.html).'

    cap and asset class in the rows and strategy/approach in the columns. I have talked
    about [PBP](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/PBP) in this space and
    was particularly interested to see that the [buy-write](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/buy-write)
    / [covered call](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/covered%20calls)
    approach is now being applied to gold in the form of the recent launch of [GLDI](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/GLDI).

    Put Write Index ETF ([HVPW](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/HVPW)),
    which is the first [put-write](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/put-write)
    ETP on the market. I have talked about put-write strategies and the CBOE S&P 500
    PutWrite Index ([PUT](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/PUT)) at some
    length here in the past and have included some links below for additional reading.

    space, [CWB](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/CWB) has been the most
    popular ETP in this space for the last few years. Earlier this week, PowerShares
    closed its competing Convertible Securities Portfolio ETF (CVRT), essentially
    ceding this space to CWB for now.

    to see how HVPW and GLDI do in terms of both risk-adjusted performance and investor
    acceptance. I certainly hope it does not take investors as long to discover these
    products as it did for them to warm up to the likes of [ZIV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/ZIV).
