- en: In light of the oncoming freight train that is today’s session, it seems somewhat
    academic to recount the action in the VIX last week.  For the record, last week
    the VIX gained 3.50 points (14.8%) to close out the week at 27.18.  The VWSI rose
    one tick to +1.

    the markets, Barry Ritholtz at [The Big Picture](http://bigpicture.typepad.com/)
    sums up the week that was and takes a stab at what will likely be a historic trading
    week in his [3 Day Weekend Linkfest: Review/Preview](http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2008/01/3-day-weekend-l.html)
    (authored Sunday evening, so it doesn’t include the thinking coming out of yesterday’s
    carnage.)'

- en: I am estimating that the VIX will open between 35 and 36, then move higher from
    that level as the rush to the exits precludes the need for anyone to yell “Fire!”  A
    VIX north of 40 would not surprise me, nor would a short-term bottom forming sometime
    later in the week.

- en: '*****Wine pairing:***  For a VWSI of +1, I recommend a guwurztraminer.  For
    the record, my favorite American version of this wine is the [dry gewurztraminer](https://www2.ibgcheckout.com/londer/catalog/view_product.jsp?product_id=1026&cat_id=1)
    from Londer Vineyards of Anderson Valley.  I have not yet sampled the 2006 vintage,
    but the 2005 was an unforgettable wine that I would love to see in a blind tasting
    against some of the top Alsatian competition.'

    I suggested [Navarro](http://www.navarrowine.com/shop/productdetail.php?prodid=546)
    and [Harvest Moon](http://www.harvestmoonwinery.com/our-wines.html). For some
    of my [top selections from Alsace](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/04/vwsi-at-1-more-gewrztraminer-ideas.html),
