- en: In my exuberance for [rCharts](http://rcharts.io/site), I have not expressed
    my equal love for its older sibling [slidify](http://slidify.org).  I adopted
    slidify a little more slowly than other R bloggers

- en: because I failed to realize that slidify does way more than just slideshows. 
    It acts as an almost universal presentation layer for R.   I am guessing that
    you have already seen some presentations created by slidify.  To make sure that
    slidify gets the credit in my work, I wanted to provide a list of examples that
    slidify created straight from R.  In these slidify gives me the power of [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/),
    [Minimal](https://github.com/orderedlist/minimal), and [Bootplus](http://aozora.github.io/bootplus/).

- en: Slidify is easy and intuitive, and it makes HTML/CSS/javascript all accessible
    to the average R user.  It has become part of my workflow, and I now start with
    .Rmd more than than I start with .R.
