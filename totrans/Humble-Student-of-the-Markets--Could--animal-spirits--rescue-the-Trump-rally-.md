# Humble Student of the Markets: Could "animal spirits" rescue the Trump rally?

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2017/03/could-animal-spirits-rescue-trump-rally.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2017/03/could-animal-spirits-rescue-trump-rally.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models**

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post,

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The

**Trend Model**

is an asset allocation model which applies trend following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or contraction (bearish)?"

My inner trader uses the

**trading component**

of the Trend Model to look for changes in the direction of the main Trend Model signal. A bullish Trend Model signal that gets less bullish is a trading "sell" signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading "buy" signal. The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. Past trading of the trading model has shown turnover rates of about 200% per month.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Buy equities*
*   Trend Model signal: Risk-on*
*   Trading model: Bearish*

on weekends and tweet mid-week observations at @humblestudent. Subscribers will also receive email notices of any changes in my trading portfolio.

**A shift in tone**

Well, that shift in tone came out of nowhere! It seems that as the focus shifted from "tax cuts" to "Obamacare", the stock market began to lose steam and retreated.

Before the bulls get overly discouraged, Main Street's enthusiasm for the Trump agenda may spur enough growth to keep the Trump rally going.

I had also raised the same question just after Inauguration Day (see
