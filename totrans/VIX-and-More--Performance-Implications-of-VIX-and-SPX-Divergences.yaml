    but some of the comments following yesterday’s [SPX Straddle Case Study Update](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/12/spx-straddle-case-study-update.html)
    indicate that it is time to dust off some statistics and address some of the issues
    that have been raised.

  zh: 读者尼凡尼如下阐述了他对这个话题的思考：
- en: '*“What I call a VIX/SPX non-confirmation, meaning that both the SPX and VIX
    were red. One of my main rules is that the VIX and the SPX cannot be the same
    color. When this happens there is something wrong. If the VIX and the SPX are
    green, then usually the SPX will go red and the same in reverse.*'

  zh: '*“我所说的VIX/SPX非确认，意味着SPX和VIX都是红色。我的主要规则之一是VIX和SPX不能颜色相同。当这种情况发生时，一定有什么问题。如果VIX和SPX都是绿色，那么通常SPX会变红，反之亦然。”*'

    They are rare and so I don''t have a lot of data on these. In the occurrences
    I have seen, the VIX has been the ''tell.'' If this holds true, then tomorrow
    should be a green day because the VIX was right, not the SPX.”*'

- en: Let me start out by saying that one of the my [most read posts of 2007](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/01/one-year-blogiversary.html)
    was titled [High Positive Correlation Between VIX and SPX Often Signals Market
    Weakness](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/05/high-positive-correlation-between-vix.html).
    The post is probably worth checking out just because it has one of my favorite
    photos on the blog, but of greater interest is likely one of my conclusions that
    “in looking at past periods of high positive correlations between the SPX and
    the VIX, it is notable that the SPX generally performs well below its historical
    mean for up to three months following the high positive correlation period.”

  zh: 让我先说一下，我2007年[最热门的帖子](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/01/one-year-blogiversary.html)之一，标题为[VIX和SPX之间的高正相关性通常预示着市场疲软](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/05/high-positive-correlation-between-vix.html)。这篇文章值得一读，其中一个原因是博客上我最喜欢的一张照片，但更有趣的是我得出的一个结论：“在观察SPX和VIX之间的高正相关期过去的几个时期，值得注意的是，SPX的表现通常在接下来的三个月内远低于历史平均水平。”
- en: Nirvanic’s contention is more specific. His “non-confirmation” days are probably
    a lot more common that he realizes. Going back to 1990, when the VIX ends the
    day in the red, the SPX also closes down about 21% of the time. When the VIX is
    green, non-confirmation is even higher, at about 25%.

  zh: 尼凡尼的观点更为具体。他的“非确认日”可能比他意识到的更为常见。回顾1990年，当VIX以红色结束交易日时，SPX也以下跌收盘的大约21%。当VIX为绿色时，非确认的情况更高，约为25%。
- en: In terms of performance, it is easy to think of the possibilities as a [2x2
    matrix](http://www.amazon.com/Power-Matrix-Thinking-Decisions-Management/dp/0787972924/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1229617532&sr=1-1),
    with the VIX either up or down on a daily basis and the SPX negatively correlated
    or positively correlated with the VIX.

  zh: 在性能方面，很容易将可能性想象成一个[2x2矩阵](http://www.amazon.com/Power-Matrix-Thinking-Decisions-Management/dp/0787972924/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1229617532&sr=1-1)，VIX要么上涨要么下跌，而SPX与VIX的相关性为负相关或正相关。
- en: Let me summarize the considerable research I have done on the subject by saying
    that if there is one pattern among the four that is most predictive of above average
    future returns, it is the one in which the SPX finishes the day in the red while
    the VIX finishes in the green. Conversely, as Nirvanic suggests, the pattern associated
    with below average future returns is the one in which the SPX is up and the VIX
    is up.

  zh: 让我通过概述我在该主题上所做的相当研究来总结，那就是在四种模式中，最能预测未来平均回报率高于平均水平的是这样一种模式：当标普500指数（SPX）收跌而波动率指数（VIX）收涨时。反之，正如Nirvanic所建议的，与未来平均回报率低于平均水平相关联的模式是：当标普500指数（SPX）收涨而波动率指数（VIX）也收涨时。
- en: Each of the two remaining patterns demonstrates very little variation from typical
    market performance; in fact the SPX down, VIX down pattern slightly outperforms
    the SPX up, VIX down pattern.

  zh: 剩下的两种模式中的每一种与典型市场表现的变化都非常小；实际上，标普500指数（SPX）下跌、波动率指数（VIX）也下跌的模式略优于标普500指数（SPX）上涨、波动率指数（VIX）下跌的模式。
- en: Note that all data cited above reflect single day changes in the SPX and VIX.
    At some point in the future I will share some of my research into longer-term
    changes in the SPX and VIX patterns, as well as their trading implications.
