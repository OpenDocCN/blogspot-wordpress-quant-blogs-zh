    IEX plans to [become](http://www.wsj.com/articles/trading-platform-iex-to-apply-for-exchange-status-1437510024)
    a full exchange and continue capturing market share, but I wonder if it might

    about what that vision might look like. To be absolutely clear, this post is highly

    the D-Peg, an order type that uses market data to make a prediction about where
    the price is heading, and transact only at times that are predicted to benefit
    the user. The D-Peg is a blending of price prediction, traditionally the role
    of traders, with the matching process itself. Combined with the 350us structural
    delay built into IEX, it’s easy to see how even crude prediction signals could
    become incredibly powerful. As cofounder Dan Aisen [puts it](http://blog.quantopian.com/the-genesis-of-an-order-type-by-daniel-aisen/):'

    to certain audiences. If the exchange has a better idea of the market price than
    its customers, it makes a sort of sense for it to use that information to ensure
    trades can only occur at that price. But, I think the idea is ultimately a misguided
    one.

    may want to make their prediction more sophisticated. If a skewed order book results
    in ‘bad fills,’ then the same can be said for trades occurring after price moves
    on correlated instruments. If the price of PBR has just dropped by 1%, then buy
    orders for PBR.A are surely in danger of being “picked off.” Should the exchange
    try to prevent that? IEX may well have decided that they’ll always allow this
    kind of adverse selection. But keep in mind that trading signals do not work forever,
    especially when they are heavily used — so IEX will likely need to continually
    revise their prediction methods.'

    Who might some of those evil traders “picking off” quotes on IEX be? The motivation
    for Thor, and a critical part of the [Flash Boys story](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/06/magazine/flash-boys-michael-lewis.html),
    is the fading of liquidity when a trader submits large marketable orders. Some
    of the traders that the D-Peg will stymie may be people like the young Brad Katsuyama,
    investors or brokers who send liquidity-seeking orders simultaneously to many
    different exchanges. Say the NBBO for BAC is 10.00/10.01, and an investor wants
    to sell a large holding, so she sends sell orders to multiple exchanges, including
    IEX. One of those orders hits Nasdaq right when another gets to IEX, but IEX waits
    350us, and, seeing the Nasdaq bid disappear, perhaps decides not to execute any
    resting D-Peg interest with the incoming order. Had the investor timed her sell
    orders differently (in a similar spirit to Thor, sending the IEX-bound order early),
    she’d have gotten a better fill rate. [[2](#bottom2iex2)]'

    fascinating aspect of the IEX speedbump is that they can use it not only to prevent
    resting orders from executing at inopportune moments, but also to help traders
    remove liquidity at opportune moments! I was surprised to see that some order
    types can automatically trade against others upon a change in IEX’s view of the
    NBBO, through a process called “[Book Recheck](https://s3.amazonaws.com/iextrading/docs/IEX+Subscriber+Manual.pdf)“.
    The mechanics of IEX seem complicated, so I could be wrong, but it looks to me
    like orders eligible to “recheck” the book may initiate a trade at a price determined
    by the realtime (*not* delayed) NBBO. [[3](#bottom3iex2)] In contrast, cancel

    and preventing it could make markets less efficient. This would only be an issue
    if IEX captured significant market share, but it does sound like permitting trading
    only during periods of market stasis is part of IEX’s long-term vision. Referring
    to the D-Peg, Chief Strategy Officer Ronan Ryan [says that](http://blog.alphaarchitect.com/2015/02/20/interview-with-a-flash-boys-all-star-ronan-ryan-from-iex/)
    “[a] core insight behind our market philosophy is that price changes are valuable
    opportunities, especially for those strategies fast enough to detect signals from
    price changes.” And also: “The economic benefit is that investors aren’t paying
    (or selling at) a worse price to a predatory strategy that is aware of quote changes
    before they are.”'

- en: It sounds like the idea is to stop an informed order from trading with an uninformed
    order, with the exchange deciding which is which. Naturally, the exchange is not
    an oracle and will misclassify some orders. But, if IEX becomes the dominant marketplace,
    and its classification is sufficiently good, informed orders will rarely get filled.
    You might think that wouldn’t happen, because IEX is only targeting ‘short-term’
    alpha, but I’d venture a guess that a sizable chunk of order flow with long-term
    alpha will also have some short-term alpha inseparably folded into it. With information-bearing
    order flow being blocked, at a certain point, the exchange will be in the position
    of deciding when the imbalance between supply and demand warrants a price change.
    I happen to think that generally markets work better when people can freely trade
    with one another at prices of their choosing [[5](#bottom5iex2)], and that a vision
    like this won’t get IEX into the same league as the major exchanges. But, market
    participants will be the judges of whether this model is a viable one.

    in the future, piggy-backing on price discovery from other markets. As Aisen suggests,
    the speedbump is probably accounting for the vast majority of their prediction
    algorithm’s edge. [[7](#bottom7iex2)] This is different from [complaints](http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/f2f7e53c-e343-11de-8d36-00144feab49a.html)
    about dark pools’ use of visible order information for price discovery. Dark pools
    can only use order information from the present, and have to report trades to
    the public tape “[as soon as practicable](http://www.finra.org/industry/trade-reporting-faq#102)“.
    The speedbump might well allow IEX to cheaply discover pricing information from
    lit market data, potentially starting a new [era](https://mechanicalmarkets.wordpress.com/2015/03/03/should-iex-become-a-full-exchange-incentives-for-exchanges-to-compete-by-increasing-delays/)

    have. Regulators may want to carefully think through possible end results of this

    under stress. HFTs thoroughly simulate their algorithms, does IEX do the same?
    In a flash crash situation, IEX might stop D-Peg matching for an extended period,
    preventing those clients from getting filled at prices they may love, and isolating
    much-needed liquidity from the rest of the market. Additionally, if IEX is too
    effective at blocking informed order flow, some traders could panic when they
    repeatedly try and fail to get executed, damaging market stability.'

    long as IEX’s market share stays below a few percent. And I think their market
    model is a perfectly fine one for a dark pool, although a little more disclosure
    wouldn’t hurt. The question is whether their target audience of fundamental traders
    will want to participate in this sort of market. I suspect ultimately that they
    won’t, though IEX might reach critical mass before participants really have time
    for reasoned debate.

    sound like a private company determining the market price via secret, non-competitive
    algorithms — unaccountably picking winners and losers. Institutional arbiters
    are part of civilized society, but ideally they’re transparent, receptive to criticism,
