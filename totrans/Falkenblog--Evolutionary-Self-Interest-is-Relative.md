# Falkenblog: Evolutionary Self Interest is Relative

> 来源：[http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2012/05/evolutionary-self-interest-is-relative.html#0001-01-01](http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2012/05/evolutionary-self-interest-is-relative.html#0001-01-01)

David Sloan Wilson and Omar Eldakar have a neat discussion on group selection in evolutionary biology.   They point out that relative fitness is the key to assessing evolutionary success, absolute fitness be damned, which fits in nicely with my hypothesis that relative utility is more relevant than absolute utility functions.  They make this explicit around 21:45-24:15, which is snipped here:

Wilson points out a  great quote in there from AJ Kane: "Only the simplest minds can think that in any great controversy, one side was mere folly."  I think that's important to remember, and makes for more thoughtful debates, because if you habitually caricature the other side as indefensible you clearly are missing their essential if not most common arguments.
