## SRE Post Mortem Gamification

I really like gamification.  In some firms its in almost part of the culture.  Of particular interest around post mortem’s is Google’s gamification [leaderboard](https://landing.google.com/sre/workbook/chapters/postmortem-culture/#postmortem-leaderboard).

> Some individuals are incentivized by a sense of accomplishment and progress toward a larger goal, such as fixing system weaknesses and increasing reliability. For these individuals, a scoreboard or burndown of postmortem action items can be an incentive. At Google, we hold “FixIt” weeks twice a year. SREs who close the most postmortem action items receive small tokens of appreciation and (of course) bragging rights
