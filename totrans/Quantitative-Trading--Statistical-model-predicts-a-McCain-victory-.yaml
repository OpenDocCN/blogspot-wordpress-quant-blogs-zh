- en: lately about a simple statistical model proposed by astrophysicists Prof. Gott
    and Dr. Colley that uses the median polls of each state to predict the November
    electoral vote. (For our un-American readers, the electoral vote is what determines
    the outcome of a general election, not the popular vote, in case the nightmarish
    2000 election has not already drilled this fact into the world's collective consciousness.)

    tested this method on the 2004 election, as well as numerous sporting events outcomes,
    and found it to be highly predictive.

    caveat is this: polls (and futures market) change with time. And at different
    times, they predict different election outcomes. So for example, at this point
    (June 2008), the polls predict a McCain victory, while the futures market at intrade.com
    predicts an Obama victory. Who is right?'

    back as the June of an election year has been conducted. (Their research was based
    on polls from September onwards.) So we do not know if the June polling prediction
    has any accuracy. Similarly, as I pointed out before, the futures market can swing
    violently even on Election Day, even in the last hours of an election.'

    resulting from median poll statistics are remarkably stable over time. In 2004,
    there was very little movement in the electoral tally from September through election
    day. Extrapolating this result, we can be somewhat more confident of their prediction
    vs. Intrade.com's, even at this early date.

    mean-reverting, implying that the current large 20 points spread between the Obama
    and McCain futures is destined to decrease in the coming months.
