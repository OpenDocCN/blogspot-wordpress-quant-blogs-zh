- en: last night. I’ve recently become acquainted with Scott’s work and find his application
    of statistical analysis to trade gap fills very interesting. I ran some tests
    to see if the outside day / inside day combination provided any edge over the
    next few days.

    Further investigation suggested the edge more likely is non-existent. Below is
    a profit curve that shows a 4-day exit strategy which should explain why I say
    this.

- en: From this chart is appears that an edge MAY have been in place during the raging
    bull of the 1990’s. At that time just about any consolidation was followed by
    a strong move up. Since the end of 1999, though, the profit curve is a complete
    flatline. It appears that whatever edge there may have been back then is no longer
    in effect.
