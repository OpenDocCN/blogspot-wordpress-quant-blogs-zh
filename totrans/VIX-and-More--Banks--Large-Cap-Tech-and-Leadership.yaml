    I mentioned the divergence between technology and financials and noted, “so far
    the financials ([XLF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLF)) have done
    a better job of leading the market up than technology stocks ([XLK](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLK))
    have done of inspiring the bears.”

    below, I focus on financials in the form of the [KBE](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/KBE)
    banking ETF and large cap technology as exemplified by the NASDAQ-100 or [NDX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/NDX).

    banking ETF. Since that date, banks have slowly trended lower (top graphic), even
    while large cap technology (middle graphic) and the S&P 500 index (gray area chart
    at bottom) have been making new highs. The change in leadership is perhaps best
    illustrated by the solid black line in the bottom portion of the chart, which
    tracks a ratio of KBE to the NDX. In March, April and the early part of May, the
    ratio quite accurately mirrored the movement in the SPX.

    to large cap technology and the ratio began to decline – all while the SPX continued
    to make new highs.

- en: I find it particularly interesting that it is not just the relative performance
    of banks that has declined, but it is also becoming increasingly common for banks
    and technology to move in different directions on the same day. This has been
    the case today and has been true for five of the past six days.

- en: I am not surprised to see leadership being passed from financials to large cap
    technology, but as I said a month ago, I do not expect the market to make any
    significant additional gains unless the two sectors are able to move up in unison.
