- en: One month ago today in [The Banks vs. Technology](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/05/banks-vs-technology.html),
    I mentioned the divergence between technology and financials and noted, “so far
    the financials ([XLF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLF)) have done
    a better job of leading the market up than technology stocks ([XLK](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLK))
    have done of inspiring the bears.”

  zh: 就在一个月前的今天，在[银行对比科技](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/05/banks-vs-technology.html)一文中，我提到了科技与金融的分歧，并指出，“到目前为止，金融股（[XLF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLF)）引领市场的表现比科技股（[XLK](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLK)）激发空头情绪做得更好。”
- en: Fast forward one month and the divergence has turned upside down. In the chart
    below, I focus on financials in the form of the [KBE](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/KBE)
    banking ETF and large cap technology as exemplified by the NASDAQ-100 or [NDX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/NDX).

  zh: 快进一个月，这种分歧完全颠倒过来。在下面的图表中，我关注的是以[KBE](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/KBE)银行ETF形式表现的金融股和以纳斯达克100或[NDX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/NDX)为代表的大型科技股。
- en: As it turns out, May 8^(th), the day of the original post, was the top in the
    banking ETF. Since that date, banks have slowly trended lower (top graphic), even
    while large cap technology (middle graphic) and the S&P 500 index (gray area chart
    at bottom) have been making new highs. The change in leadership is perhaps best
    illustrated by the solid black line in the bottom portion of the chart, which
    tracks a ratio of KBE to the NDX. In March, April and the early part of May, the
    ratio quite accurately mirrored the movement in the SPX.

  zh: 结果证明，5月8日（原文发布日），是银行ETF的最高点。自那以来，银行缓慢地下行（顶部图表），即使大型科技股（中间图表）和标普500指数（底部灰色区域图表）一直在创出新高。领导权的转变或许最好由图表底部的一条实线来表示，该线追踪KBE与NDX的比率。在3月、4月和5月初，这个比率非常准确地反映了标普500指数的走势。
- en: During the course of the past four weeks, however, leadership flipped from banks
    to large cap technology and the ratio began to decline – all while the SPX continued
    to make new highs.

  zh: 然而，在过去四周的时间里，领导权从银行转向了大型科技股，比率开始下降，而标普500指数却继续创出新高。
- en: I find it particularly interesting that it is not just the relative performance
    of banks that has declined, but it is also becoming increasingly common for banks
    and technology to move in different directions on the same day. This has been
    the case today and has been true for five of the past six days.

  zh: 我发现特别有趣的是，不仅仅是银行的相对表现下降，而且银行与科技在同一日走向不同方向的情况也变得越来越普遍。今天就是这样，过去的六天中有五天也是如此。
- en: I am not surprised to see leadership being passed from financials to large cap
    technology, but as I said a month ago, I do not expect the market to make any
    significant additional gains unless the two sectors are able to move up in unison.

  zh: 我不惊讶于领导权从金融股转移到大型科技股，但正如我一个月前所说，除非这两个板块能够同步上涨，我不认为市场会取得任何显著的额外收益。
