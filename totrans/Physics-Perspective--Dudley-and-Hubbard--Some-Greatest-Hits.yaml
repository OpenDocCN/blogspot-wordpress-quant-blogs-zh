- en: '"The shift from depository institution intermediation to capital markets intermediation
    appears to be driven mostly by technological developments. Computational costs
    have fallen rapidly. As technology has improved, information has become much more
    broadly available. This has improved transparency. As this has occurred, depository
    institutions have lost some of their ability to charge a premium for their intermediary
    services. Often, borrowers and lenders interact directly, as they find that the
    lender can earn more and the borrower can pay less by cutting out the depository
    intermediary as a middleman."'

- en: '...the development of the capital markets has helped distribute risk more efficiently.
    Part of the efficient allocation of capital is the transfer of risk to those best
    able to bear it — either because they are less risk averse or because the new
    risk is uncorrelated or even negatively correlated with other risks in a portfolio.
    This ability to transfer risk facilitates greater risk-taking, but this increased
    risk-taking does not destabilize the economy. The development of the derivatives
    market has played a particularly important role in this risk-transfer process.'

- en: Credit derivative obligations have become an important element that has helped
    protect bank lending portfolios against loss. These instruments allow a bank to
    obtain protection from a third party against the risk of a corporate bankruptcy.
    This protection allows the bank to continue to lend. At the same time, the bank
    can limit its credit exposure to individual counterparties and diversify its credit
    exposure across industries and geographically. The decline in banking failures
    is evidence that derivatives have helped to distribute risk more broadly throughout
    the economy.

- en: First, because the capital markets use mark-to-market accounting, it is more
    difficult for problems to be deferred. As a result, pain is borne in real time,
    which means that the ultimate shock to the economy tends to be smaller. In contrast,
    when depository institutions get into trouble as a group, the pressure for regulatory
    forbearance increases. Deferral causes the magnitude of the problem to increase.
    Usually — as can be seen with the US saving and loan crisis and in the case of
    Japan’s decade-long banking crisis — this forbearance just creates a much bigger
    problem that poses a greater threat to macroeconomic stability.

    have increased the benefits of following good policies and increased the cost
    of following bad ones. Good policies result in lower risk premia and higher financial
    asset prices. Investors are supportive. Bad policies lead to bad financial market
    performance, which increases investor pressure on policymakers to amend their
    policy choices. As a result, the quality of economic policymaking has improved

    market less volatile. With the development of a secondary mortgage market and
    the elimination of interest rate ceilings on bank deposits, “credit crunches”
    of the sort that periodically shut off the supply of funds to home buyers, and
    crushed the homebuilding industry between 1966 and 1982, are a thing of the past.
    Today, the supply of credit to qualified home buyers is virtually assured. The
    result has been to cut the volatility of activity in the economy’s most interest-sensitive
    sector virtually in half. This change is a truly significant improvement, because
    it means that the economy’s most credit-sensitive sector is now more stable.
