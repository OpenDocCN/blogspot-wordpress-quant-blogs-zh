    the new VIX weekly futures provided the foundation for a VIX ETP that was based
    on those futures.  While details are sketchy regarding VMAX and VMIN, they will
    be holding VIX weekly futures and will target a weighted-average VIX futures maturity
    that is less than thirty days.  These ETFs will be actively managed and it is
    likely that they will not have a fixed target maturity.  Theoretically, the target
    maturity could vary anywhere from five days to 29 days, though given the holdings
    and the “max” and “min” embedded in the ticker symbol, I would anticipate an aggressive
    target maturity on the order of 7-14 calendar days.

    vulnerable to new products that have a higher beta and should more closely track
    the spot/cash VIX on a daily basis.  Depending upon the target maturity of VMAX
    and VMIN, I would not be surprised if these products have 50% more beta than VXX
    and XIV.  For this reason, I would be shocked if, at the very minimum, VMAX and
    VMIN do not become darlings of the day-trading crowd – a forecast not unlike the
    one I made on November 14, 2008 in
