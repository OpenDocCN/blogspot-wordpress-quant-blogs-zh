    to the cratering oil price, the divergence began in late 2013/early 2014, when
    oil prices were still relatively robust. This picture of falling labor demand
    is even more disturbing in light of analysis from

    oil producer. In past cycles, falling commodity prices would see the economies
    of the resource-rich West recede while the manufacturing base in Ontario and Quebec
    boom. Unfortunately, Canada may not see the same kind of offsetting rise in manufacturing
    employment as it had in past cycles.

    the world. Canadian costs are higher than its NAFTA partners, the US and Mexico.
    In the past, where American manufacturing might have looked at locating plants
    in Central Canada because of its proximity to markets, educated labor force and
    costs, either staying home in America or moving to Mexico is a more compelling
    choice today.

    and 2014\. While American and Mexican manufacturing competitiveness has stayed
    the same or improved, Canadian competitiveness has declined.

- en: The bottom line is that all these long-term developments are bearish for the
    Canadian Dollar, otherwise known as the loonie. The chart below depicts the CADUSD
    exchange rate (top panel, black), the WTI oil price (top panel, green) and the
    USD Index (bottom panel). While the loonie is thought of as a petro-currency and
    therefore highly correlated to oil prices, oil prices have stabilized recently
    while the loonie has fallen, possibly because of these differences in competitiveness.

    BCG study showed a Canadian cost of 115, compared to 100 for the USD and 91 for
    Mexico. That study was done when the CADUSD exchange rate was about 0.90\. If
    all of the adjustment were to made through the exchange rate mechanism, CADUSD
    would have to fall to 0.78 to be competitive with American manufacturing and would
    have to fall to 0.72 to be competitive with Mexican manufacturing.

    of a much lower loonie over the next few years. Given the propensity for markets
    to overshoot, I wouldn't be totally surprised to see the exchange rate trade with
    a 6-handle before it finally bottoms.
