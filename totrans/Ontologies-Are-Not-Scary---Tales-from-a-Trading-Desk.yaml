- en: FOAF describes the world using simple ideas inspired by the Web. In FOAF descriptions,
    there are only various kinds of things and links, which we call properties. The
    types of the things we talk about in FOAF are called classes. FOAF is therefore
    defined as a dictionary of terms, each of which is either a class or a property.
    Other projects alongside FOAF provide other sets of classes and properties, many
    of which are linked with those defined in FOAF.

    file, which maps the relational world (tables and columns) to the Ontology world
    (classes and properties).
