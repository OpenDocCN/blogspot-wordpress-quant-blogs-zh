- en: Public pensions report that over the 25-year period from 1985 through 2011 they
    have achieved a median investment return of 8.8 percent, exceeding the 8 percent
    returns they project for the future, and have earned these returns without taking
    undue risks. Given this, they say, why shouldn’t we assume they can keep on doing
    so into the future?

    to 3%. The raised the sample return to an average bond portfolio by about 3% annually.
    If long term interest rates went to zero, the benefit would only be about 2.1%
    annually. Most likely, rates will rise, because that is what the Fed wants them
    to do! Thus, instead of a 3% tailwind, there will be something like a 1-2% wind
    in our faces over the next 25 years.
