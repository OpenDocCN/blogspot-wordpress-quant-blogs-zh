    in Microsoft Reading, UK. Mike [Taulty](http://mtaulty.com/communityserver/blogs/mike_taultys_blog/default.aspx)
    kicked off an intro in Microsoft UK prior to the Live Keynote stream. Looks from
    the agenda I need to move to the Memphis room at 7:30pm for the [Future of C#
    and VB](http://www.microsoftpdc.com/2009/FT11) – I did get a hint under NDA as
    to what is coming last week 🙂

    Express for [WindowsPhone](http://www.microsoft.com/express/Phone/)) for Windows
    Phone 7 showed that you got a choice of XNA or Silverlight 🙂 No HTML5\. No surprise
    Scott used OData – no push 😦 Profiler that was demo’d is very nice for the Windows
    Phone – can we get this for Silverlight RIA’s (not just Windows Phone 7)
