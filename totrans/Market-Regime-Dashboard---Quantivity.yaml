    and excellent attendant reader comments, posited that effective quantitative trading
    needs to dynamically adapt to context. Yet, one of the most difficult systemic
    quant problems is *identifying relevant “context”, how to measure it, and how
    to visualize it*.

    ([technical analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_analysis) is particular
    guilty). This is unfortunate, as basic time-series analysis offers to tickle out
    and visualize myriad richness otherwise invisible.

    of a single instrument* (in pictures, as one is worth a 1000 words). For simplicity,
    each post focuses on SPY during 2007 – 2008 and explore both [time domain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-domain)
    and [frequency domain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_domain). The first
    two posts will focus on identifying regime structure in the time domain:'

    orchestra. First, one must appreciate the progression and sequence of notes, as
    expressed by a sheet of music, played by each instrument; this is the time domain.
    Second, one must appreciate how to distinguish the [melodies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melodies)
    and [harmonies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonies) played by each instrument
    or group of instruments; this is the frequency domain. Both are important, each
    providing an [orthogonal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonality) (or [orthonormal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthonormal))
    perspective on the same phenomenon.
