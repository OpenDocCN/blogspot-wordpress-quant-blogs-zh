    [TVIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TVIX)to become a popular short-term
    trading vehicle. I [predicted](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/12/vix-and-more-and-2011-bespoke.html)
    in the middle of December that TVIX “will hit a tipping point and become the darling
    of day traders,” but in the absence of meaningful volatility during the last few
    months, it has sometimes been difficult to see the potential of TVIX.

    point and traded a record 120,000 shares in the first half of today’s session,
    easily eclipsing its prior volume mark.

    in November 2008, I came out with what sounded like an outrageous claim at the
    time: [Prediction: Direxion Triple ETFs Will Revolutionize Day Trading](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/11/prediction-direxion-triple-etfs-will.html).
    It took awhile, but eventually these products became the preferred vehicles for
    many short-term traders. Their popularity was undercut somewhat when margin requirements
    were raised to match the leverage built into these trades. With TVIX, which is
    essentially a +2x version of [VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX),
    [VIXY](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIXY) and [VIIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIIX),
    I expect that the tipping point has arrived today. With new liquidity, short-term
    traders now have a product where 10% daily moves will be relatively common and
    margin issues should be minimal.'

    obstacles, including negative [roll yield](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/roll%20yield)

    issues, as well as the loss in value associated with volatility + compounding
    that plague leveraged ETFs.
