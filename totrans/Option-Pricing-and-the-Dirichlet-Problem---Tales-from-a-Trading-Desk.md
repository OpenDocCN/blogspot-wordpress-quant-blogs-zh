## Option Pricing and the Dirichlet Problem

Interesting [read](http://www.wilmott.com/pdfs/120830_joshi.pdf) on option pricing.  Not sure is anyone is using this method in the non-academic world, but the conclusion implies opportunity:

We have not proven any new results, however, we have seen that a classical technique has a natural interpretation in terms of derivatives pricing.  With this interpretation the maximum principle becomes rather obvious. We have studied a rather simple special case, the flat Laplacian on R^n, however, it is clear that the techniques could easily be applied in a much wider range of cases
