- en: Paul Krugman won the Nobel, and I remember his work was essential reading for
    those in the Industrial Organization series. But I never encountered it classes
    I took in macro, finance or information theory. So, I don't have a sense to which
    they are clever or useful, by actually working them through and comparing them
    to a literature.
