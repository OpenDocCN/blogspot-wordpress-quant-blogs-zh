    not to vomit. For the market that meant a lower high and a higher low than Thursday
    causing Friday’s range to be completely “inside” Thursday's range. The indices
    also closed lower on the day. Below is a chart of the SPY going back to October
    8th, which was the day it closed at its highest level. Every inside day with a
    down close is marked with a blue dot.

    -0.48%, -2.62%, -1.27%, -2.45%, -2.64%. That is an average loss of 1.9% the following
    day. Five for five losers. The pattern isn’t pretty.'

    Looking back to the beginning of 2004, there have been 53 inside days with down
    closes for the SPY. Sixty-four percent of them were followed by a selloff the
    following day. The average loss was about 0.7% and the average gain 0.5%. Total
    losses outsized total gains by 2.3 to 1.

    58% of the time following an inside day with a down close. There were 104 occurrences.
    The average loss the next day was 0.9% while the average gain was 0.6%. In all
    total losses outsized total gains by about 2.1 to 1.

    the flu. For the market, the pattern has historically signaled short-term trouble.
