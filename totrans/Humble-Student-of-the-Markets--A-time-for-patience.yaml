- en: In the aftermath of the rally off the October bottom, the S&P 500 is consolidating
    its gains after breaking out through resistance at 4600 to form a cup and handle
    breakout. However, it was rejected at all-time high resistance and it's now working
    off an overbought condition, as evidenced by the 5-week RSI. The VVIX to VIX ratio,
    which has led past tactical peaks in stock prices, peaked out just before the
    January highs, but the lack of a negative divergence in this ratio is constructive
    inasmuch as this is not a signal of a major top. I interpret current conditions
    as a consolidation within an uptrend.
