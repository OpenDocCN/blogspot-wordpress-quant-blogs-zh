- en: I’ve updated the Quantifiable Edges Big Time Swing System overview page with
    results through June 30\. There have been no trades since then. The system only
    averages about 1 trade per month, so I typically update the results bi-annually.
    The QE Big Time Swing System has been on a roll in 2013\.  It has had 6 trades,
    one of which was a carry-over from near the end of 2012\.  Five of these trades
    have been to the long side, and one short.  All of them posted gains.  The signals
    produced a net return of 10.84% for SPY (including dividends, commissions of $0.01/share,
    and an assumed interest rate on cash of 0.1%).  The system also continues to make
    new equity highs.

- en: The Big Time Swing System provides easy to follow mechanical rules. The standard
    parameters are not optimized and have performed quite well (they are the ones
    used for all performance metrics). There are only about 11 trades per year averaging
    7 trading days per trade. All entries and exits are either at the open or the
    close. And to be sure you have everything set up properly traders may follow the
    private purchasers-only blog that tracks all SPY signals and possible entry/exit
    levels. This service is free for 12 months from the date of purchase.

- en: For system developers looking for a system that they can use as a base to build
    their own system from, the Big Time Swing is an attractive option. It is all open-coded
    and comes complete with a substantial amount of background historical research.
    And since it is only in the market about ¼ of the time, it can easily be combined
    with other systems to provide greater efficiency of capital. Once you’re ready
    to try and improve the system yourself you can also refer to the system manual
    or the August 2010 purchaser-only webinar – both of which discuss numerous ideas
    for customization.
