    trade, also known as the *basis risk*. A ![\epsilon {\rightarrow} 0](img/3dca0ebedeaac716ce1c8c938ea0fb82.png)

    ![\epsilon ](img/55f2c1da05b6d3e0249335f5aa024a8a.png) is equivalent to neutralizing

    (an [exotic beta](https://quantivity.wordpress.com/2011/09/29/you-dont-have-alpha),

    not be derivatives on ![u](img/3e3dc85b695f49b6073b5656627101bb.png). Hence, the
