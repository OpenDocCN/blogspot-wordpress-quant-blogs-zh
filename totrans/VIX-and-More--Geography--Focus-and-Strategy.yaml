    Zone?](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/05/bicoastal-tradingor-are-you-trading-in.html)
    I offered some thoughts on my experience trading on the West Coast versus the
    East Coast. At the time, I speculated that the Mountain Time Zone might be the
    best place to have a trading life that was seamlessly interwoven with the rest
    that life has to offer.

    that at least for those who are content being an end-of-day trader, Hawaii may
    indeed be the ideal trading paradise – and certainly one with the most alluring
    [geography dividend](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/geography%20dividend).

    it struck me how much geography has influenced what I focus on, what and how I
    trade, and more broadly what strategies I implement.

    European markets and economic data that is released just before or after the opening
    bell. I am much more likely to trade futures and focus my attention on the many
    blue chips whose earnings are released before the market opens. I may even break
    with tradition and turn on CNBC. In short, I have a much greater BMO focus.

    markets (checking in before I go to bed), trade a preponderance of West Coast
    technology stocks that generally report after the markets are closed and also
    find myself trading in the after-hours session much more often.

    during daylight savings time) and my routine switches to glancing at the markets,
    going out for a run, checking to see if the markets are relatively quiet when
    I return, showering and going for breakfast, then making any position adjustments
    just prior to the closing bell. All strategies become end of day strategies and
    short-term trades are much more likely to be multi-day swing trades than day trades.

    and that focus has important implications for what I trade, when I trade it and
    what my anticipated holding period is for each position. Strategy, therefore,
    becomes a byproduct of geography.

    to put the world in a different perspective and to serve as a reminder that no
    matter where you are – either as a visitor or with roots firmly in the ground
    – it is important to match your strategies and focus to your geography and time
    zone.
