- en: A friend recently asked me my opinion about what she should do with a certain
    stock. This is the sort of question that I hate to answer. First of all, I knew
    nothing about the stock, which happened to be the shares of a junior mining company.
    Notwithstanding the fact that I knew nothing about it, it was also difficult to
    answer the question because I knew little about the rest of the portfolio. How
    big a position is it? Why did she buy it in the first place? Was it for diversification?
    Was it because she got a "hot tip"?

    an investor can answer that question, then it's impossible to know what to do
    with the stock.

    focused fundamental research. Under those circumstances, you want to bet where
    his edge is, i.e. fundamental research, and a 15 to 20 stock portfolio may not
    be a bad idea. On the other hand, a top-down based investment process that picks
    sectors or countries needs a much larger number of positions in the portfolio
    because you want to diversify away the individual stock bets in the portfolio
    but concentrate the sector or country bets.
