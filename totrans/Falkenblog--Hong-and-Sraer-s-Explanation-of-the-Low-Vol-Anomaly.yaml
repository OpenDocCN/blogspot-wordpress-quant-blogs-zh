- en: a simple model where greater dispersion in in beliefs generated a greater price
    for stocks because those holders of a stock are in the 95th percentile of valuation,
    and given a constant mean, a higher variance implies a higher 95th percentile.
    Key to this model is the short sales constraint, because otherwise sellers would
    see these assets as overpriced and short them. Another key is limited rationality,
    because people should simply not include high beta assets in their portfolio;
    the market portfolio is dominated by one that excludes high volatility assets.

    the 'new' finding that their model shows that when there is greater disagreement,
    there will be a greater low volatility premium.  I don't think that's really new,
    in that it follows pretty straightforwardly from the Milller model.

    below average returns. Lower than CAPM is different than lower than average. Further,
    it requires irrationality by those who don't have opinions on stocks, because
    it seems obvious that investors without a view should simply avoid high volatility
    stocks in their index funds. Thus, in both these models, low volatility investing
    should be much more popular than it is.

    error, the fact that one underperforms 'the market' too much too often. Sure,
    over time it's a higher Sharpe ratio, but the real objective is a relative return,

    but after 20 years several trends in the zeitgeist have changed a lot, in large
    part due to the increase in behavioral finance, Freakonomics, and the simple persistence
    of the low volatility cross-sectional fact.  But I guess I have the intellectual
    equivalent of Stockholm syndrome, as the irrationality obstacle was simply burned
    into my brain. I don't like results that imply massive arbitrage to this day.
