    Once created they tend to survive and grow over time, even when the increases
    initially were said to be temporary. The underlying reason for this is that interest
    groups develop around new and expanded programs, and they lobby to keep and expand
    those programs.

    is likely to have less value. A very large amount of money will be spent quickly
    over a two-year period: $500 billion amounts to about one-quarter of the total
    federal government annual spending of $2 trillion. It is extremely difficult for
    any group, private as well as public, to spend such a large sum wisely in a short
    period of time.'

    or Democrats per se, as they are giving the US what it wants. I just think what
    most people want is not in their best interest, like voting for rent controls.
