    to provide the public with information regarding those institutions that have
    “blown up”, i.e., failed in one sense or another. This could be accomplished by
    establishing an independent investigatory agency or department patterned after
    the National Transportation Safety Board, e.g., a “Capital Markets Safety Board”,
    in which a dedicated and experienced team of forensic accountants, lawyers, and
    financial engineers sift through the wreckage of every failed financial institution
    and produces a publicly available report documenting the details of each failure
    and providing recommendations for avoiding such fates in the future.

    when they failed. Too many times all we have after big disasters are journalist
    accounts, and they bring their own bias to these stories, as inevitably to get
    good info they need an insider, and every insider has an agenda. Most investors
    don't like revisiting their failures, and of course legal risk inhibits discussing
    events too much, so there's a real bias for the story to die at the very superficial
    level of some local paper accounts.
