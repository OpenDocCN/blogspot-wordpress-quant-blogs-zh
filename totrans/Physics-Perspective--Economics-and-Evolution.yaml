    and Organization (JEBO) that I have coedited with David Sloan Wilson and John
    M. Gowdy.  The special issue makes a play for increasing the use of evolutionary
    theory in economics.  Bhalla argues that this involves arguing that economics
    should not necessarily involve assuming people rationally maximize utility or
    that equilibrium analysis should be the focus of analysis.  Mark is unhappy about
    this characterization and disses the argument pretty hard.  Of course, he is welcome
    to his view.

    in 1996 to the European Society for Evolutionary Political Economy (while I am
    into such things, I know nothing of this group).  One can directly access PK's
    speech at [http://www.pkarchive.org/evolute.html](http://www.pkarchive.org/evolute.html)
    , if one does not want to go through Mark's link.  It may well be that Krugman
    would now disavow parts of this speech, or at least pull his punches a bit, but
    it is a place where he puts on his neoclassical hat full force and defends orthodox
    economics full bore.  This may well not be inconsistent with his current stance as
    the critic of new neoclassical synthesis views, given that one can view him to
    some degree as an advocate of the old MIT-Samuelson "neoclassical synthesis" that adopted
    a neo-Keynesian ISLM approach to macro while essentially maintaining a position
    of full orthodoxy in microeconomics.  Let us grant that this orthodoxy includes emphasizing agents
    who are fully rational and maximize their well-defined utility that interacts
    with other economic agents to lead reasonably quickly to equilibrium, with this
    being the appropriate focus of analysis.

    evolutionary theory are seriously narrow and misleading.  He essentially argues
    that evolutionary theory is all about maximization and equilibrium and that those
    who focus on other approaches, including Stephen Jay Gould and Stuart Kauffman,
    are just peripheral losers within established evolutionary theory, which is represented
    by the work of Richard Dawkins.  He emphasizes the importance of evolutionary
    game theory developed by Maynard-Smith and then introduced into economics, where
    it is now more or less a part of standard economics.  He even notes that Hamilton
    and others allow for rewards for cooperation.  This is all true, and can even
    be viewed ironically as a form of microfoundations of macroevolution within evolutionary
    theory, although it is not the whole story.

    of evolutionary economics.  Of course, economics influenced evolutionary theory
    from the beginning, notably through the influence of Malthus on Darwin and Wallace. 
    Some forms of evolutionary economics have always been completely consistent with
    fully orthodox neoclassical economics, most notably the arguments regarding firm
    survival and the pressure to maximize profits due to natural selection pressures
    within competition, as emphasized in the famous 1950 paper by Armen Alchian, followed
    up by Milton Friedman in his Essay on Positive Economics.

    school, the old institutionalists, who founded the AEA and once ran it, only to
    be overcome and replaced by the MIT neoclassical synthesis of Samuelson.  It is
    easy to dismiss them, but they have made many insights and continue to offer more,
    most notably through the Journal of Economic Issues.  An irony is that the person
    who coined the term "neoclassical economics" was none other than Thorstein Veblen,
    founder of the institutionalist evolutionary school.  I suspect that Krugman and
    Thoma probably consider many of his ideas to be quite relevant to our current
    situation.

    neo-Schumpeterian school whose main leaders have been Nelson and Winter and their
    followers.  This school continues with many followers and journals such as Journal
    of Evolutionary Economics and Industrial and Corporate Change.  I do not see anybody
    seriously questioning that they have had much to offer regarding the study of
    technological change.

    sort of evolutionary equivalent of John Kenneth Galbraith, an idea popular among
    the public, but dismissed within evolutionary theory itself.  I think that Krugman
    is seriously off on this characterization, and the idea of multiple equilibria
    and dynamic discontinuities is one that is certainly of great relevance in economics. 
    Just what is going on when we see major financial crashes?

    with Kauffman of the Santa Fe Institute, whom Krugman also dismisses.  This approach
    is deeply linked with what is probably the most serious competitor to the DSGE
    model in macro analysis, namely agent-based modeling.  Many of those models use
    genetic algorithms, and evolutionary ideas such as emergence are taken very seriously
    in this approach.  Indeed, this is an alternative way of doing micro foundations
    of macro, an issue that Krugman simply does not address at all, which does not
    necessarily depend on the old orthodoxy of rational agent utility maximization
    or convergence on equilibria within dynamic evolutionary processes.

    ago and enjoyed it; Krugman is someone who, it seems to me, reads widely and is
    open to ideas from other areas of science, although he admitted in the speech
    that he is "basically a maximization-and-equilibrium kind of guy". Rosser mentions
    Stephen Jay Gould and the idea of punctuated equilibrium. From my readings of
    Gould, that idea remained more or less qualitative with him and his co-author
    (Eldridge I think), but was subsequently developed in more detail by others such
    as physicist Per Bak. Their view was that ecosystems and ecologies aren't in a
    static equilibrium of any sort, but in a much more dynamic state through which
    vast avalanches of change occasionally ripple for perfectly ordinary reasons and
    having NOTHING to do with external shocks to the system. This is more at the forefront
    of our understanding of whole-system dynamics than is the old idea of evolutionary
    stable states and Nash equilibria (although these are still useful on shorter
    timescales for understanding interactions between a small number of species).

    that species have evolved to maximize their (local) fitness, then you open yourself
    to potentially huge errors of misinterpretation. You might try to interpret everything
    you see is an optimal solution to some problem, even if some of it, or even most
    of it, might have nothing to do with optimality. Sure enough, it turns out that
    an awful lot of what happens in evolution is driven not by genetic changes that
    increase fitness at all, but rather to changes that are

    in economics, the we might be making systematic errors in assuming the marketplace
    victory of one firm, technology, computer device or idea over another generally
    has something to do with its inherent superiority. It may simply reflect a series
    of random accidents. In principle, this might not be an odd or unusual thing,
    but the general rule across the board. Taking this possibility seriously would
    be a big shift for economics, I think, and something it would learn from evolution.

    used in economics as a source of metaphor and mathematical models has been/is
    being cast aside in evolution and ecology by a richer mathematical framework that
    goes well beyond equilibrium. I hope some of this will be discussed in the special
    issue. Lots of us who aren't biologists haven't kept up with what is going on
    in biology and we're quite a bit out of date. For example, genes flow down through
    the generations, don't they, transmitted vertically from one generation to the
    next? There is no sideways or horizontal flow of genes between different organisms;
    we all know that. Indeed, that was the lore for 50 years at least and I only know
    that this idea is wrong because New Scientist a few years ago asked me to
