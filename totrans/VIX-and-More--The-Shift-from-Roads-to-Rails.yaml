- en: The [Dow Jones Transportation Average](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Transportation_Average)
    ([DJTA](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/DJTA)) has a long and storied
    history, but has been frequently overlooked in recent years.  Despite this secondary
    billing, the index is up over 30% since bottoming in January and is close to challenging
    last summer’s all-time high.

    frequently rising as an economy transitions from recession to recovery.  As such,
    the rise in this index has been noted by many observers as a sign of better economic
    times ahead.

- en: 'The reality is that the transportation index aggregates several related industries,
    including commercial airlines, shipping companies, railroads, truckers, and air
    freight firms.  These firms have had widely varying fortunes lately and the outlook
    is different from segment to segment.  One important distinction between these
    companies is their exposure to rising fuel costs.  Not surprisingly, airlines
    and truckers have been hit hard by rising energy prices.  Shippers and railroads,
    however, have suffered less of an impact.  The distinction is dramatic when drawn
    between railroads and airlines.  In the chart below, I have included not only
    the DJTA, but the Dow Jones US Railroad Index [($DJUSRR](http://stockcharts.com/charts/gallery.html?%24djustr))
    and the Dow Jones US Airlines Index [($DJUSAR](http://stockcharts.com/charts/gallery.html?%24djusar)).  The
    chart shows what most of us already know: the rails are booming and the airlines
    are struggling.'

    back toward the traditional bulk carriers: railroads and shipping companies.  In
    an era of rapidly expanding global trade, not only will the winners be the ones
    with a significant cost advantage, but their growing market share and growing
    markets should make for some enticing investment opportunities.'
