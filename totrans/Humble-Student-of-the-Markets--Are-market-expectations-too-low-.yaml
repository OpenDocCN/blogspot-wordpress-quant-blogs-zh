- en: The market expectations going into the European summit last week was extremely
    low. When the leaders of Europe announced the usual plan to have a plan, the markets
    surged. Despite the weekend's chorus of how the devil is in the details of the
    plan and why the plan won't work, European stock markets continued to rise on
    Monday.

- en: After three decades of annual growth averaging 10%, China's bullet-train economy
    is slowing markedly. Economic problems in Europe and the U.S. are stunting export
    growth, long the primary driver of China's economic miracle. Growth in industrial
    production has likewise been decelerating for months. This year growth in gross
    domestic product could slip to 8%—and it may get a lot worse from there. Though
    recently announced interest-rate cuts and a ramp-up in the government's already
    massive infrastructure spending could postpone the day of reckoning, to us it
    looks like the Great China Growth Story may be falling apart.
