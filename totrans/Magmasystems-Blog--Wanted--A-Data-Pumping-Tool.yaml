    career, it is remarkable how many systems do not have Unit Testing set up.
  prefs: []

- en: Concepts like Unit Testing, TDD, code metrics, etc are just starting to make
    their ways into development groups in IB's. However, one of the areas that has
    been ignored is stress and soak testing.

- en: One of the tools that we need is what I refer to as a generic Data Pumper. This
    is a service that can be run to generate data of a certain shape, and pump the
    data into waiting applications. Some types of data that we may need to pump include
    quotes, executions, risk, etc.

    500 messages per second. We can also put some sort of distribution on the interval,
    so that the intervals would be the lowest at the beginning and at the end of the
    playback period (simulating market open and close).'

    data using the timings of the real data.'
