# VIX and More: VIX Rallies to 10 Day Moving Average

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/11/vix-rallies-to-10-day-moving-average.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/11/vix-rallies-to-10-day-moving-average.html#0001-01-01)

The VIX has rallied right up to the [10 day simple moving average](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/10%20day%20SMA) (63.90) today and appears to be hitting some resistance in that area.

Traditional VIXology says that the VIX and SPX should be in a neutral zone when the VIX is near the 10 day SMA.

It will be interesting to see if the remaining bulls are willing to step in at current levels.
