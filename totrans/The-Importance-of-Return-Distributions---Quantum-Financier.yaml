- en: When designing a strategy, I like to observe the probability distribution of
    the asset I plan to trade. It yields precious information on the behavior of the
    underlying and can also help identify the market regime in effect for a given
    period.

    distribution can work, but from a quantitative trading point of view, it does
    not really help; we want something more mechanical that we can rely on over and
    over. The answer is quite simple; simple curve analysis can give us the mechanical
    capability we are looking for. Data on the mean, median, skew, kurtosis, etc.
    of a distribution can all be fed as parameters to be analyzed in a trading system.

    helpful to know how a given indicator or strategy affect the return distribution.
    A comparison between the raw return distribution and one processed with signals
    from a strategy can help indicate whether the strategy is traded with the right
    bias for the current market regime or if a strategy is suddenly diminishing in
    profitability. Furthermore, for the daily swing traders amongst us, probability
    densities analysis can help us see if our indicators really help mitigate daily
    MR.

    adaptive strategies. It provides a strategy with instant feedback on its performance
    and its effect on the return series of the underlying; taking that in consideration
    can be a good base to build on when designing your own adaptive algorithms (more
    on that later..).
