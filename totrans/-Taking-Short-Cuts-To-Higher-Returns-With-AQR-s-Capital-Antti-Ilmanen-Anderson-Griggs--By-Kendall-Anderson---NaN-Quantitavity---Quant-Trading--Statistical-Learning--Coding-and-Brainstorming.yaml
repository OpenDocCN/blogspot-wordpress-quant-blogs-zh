    Annual European Investment Conference in Paris, France.  Antti Ilmanen, Ph.D.
    was one of the presenters.  The title of his Presentation was Understanding Expected
    Returns.  This month’s letter is based on this presentation as it appeared in
    the June 2012 publication CFA Institute Conference Proceedings Quarterly.*'

    time for study is encouraged, in hopes that financial rewards will follow.'

    LLP at the Fourth Annual European Investment Conference, held last year in partnership

    Sachs, & Company alumni and has been led by Cliff Asness**.  Dr. Asness is well
    known in the world of investment management both for his academic work and his
    skillful management of AQR.  For those outside the industry, Dr. Asness is better
    known for the home he is building—a 25,900 square foot house in Greenwich, Connecticut;
    complete with indoor swimming pool and tennis court.  No doubt a library and office
    will take up a couple of square feet.'

    without the help of some very talented professionals who were willing to give
    up a bit of the financial rewards of owning a business for the freedom to spend
    more of their day in research, with the full blessing of a management team.  I
    believe Antti Ilmanen is one such individual.  Having earned a Ph.D. in Finance
    from Dr. Asness’ alma mater the University of Chicago, he spent a decade with
    Salomon Brothers before moving on to Brevan Howard, a well known hedge fund from
    the United Kingdom.   His articles have earned him a Graham & Dodd scroll and
    the Bernstein Fabozzi/Jacobs Levy award.  His book,**Expected Returns:  An Investor’s
    Guide to Harvesting Market Rewards**, was published last year.  If you are interested,
    this 500 page book is readily available for your reading pleasure from your favorite
    book outlet.

    to do list, I thought I would share with you a few of Dr. Ilmanen’s findings** as
    seen through the biased eyes of yours truly, a confirmed cheapskate who only wants
    to invest in bargains.  His work shows that five investment strategies, value,
    carry, trend or momentum, volatility, and liquidity have worked well over long
    periods of time to gain diversification and reduce the dependency of returns on
    the stock market itself.  Having worked well over time gives us no guarantee that
    they will work in the future, however it is worth our effort to learn a little
    about them and see if they could work for us.'

- en: '**Of the five, carry should not be a strategy used by individual investors**. 
    In its simplest form, carry investing involves borrowing at a low rate and lending
    at a higher rate in hopes that the interest earned exceeds the interest cost of
    borrowing.  Institutions have developed multiple approaches to use carry in just
    about every major asset class.  This sophisticated strategy requires a very large
    commitment of funds and the need to be able to withstand periods of dramatic losses
    that could easily wipe out years of solid performance.'

    not for the majority of us.  **Common sense tells us that if we give up the ability
    to convert our investments into cash immediately we should be paid extra.  As
    Dr. Ilmanen’s work shows this has held true over many years.  The problem, like
    carry, is that you must commit an exceptional amount of cash that you will not
    need in order to obtain the rewards of illiquidity.  Recently a number of firms
    have promoted the use of non-tradable real estate investment trusts to individuals
    to capture this extra return.  Not counting the fact that the majority of these
    REITs rely on the use of borrowed money that has to be repaid before you profit,
    the minimum investment required for many of these programs can reduce your overall
    portfolio diversification, thus increasing your risk.  Because advertising rules
    are changing, you will soon be seeing and hearing of the great opportunities that
    venture capital, hedge funds, private equity and other forms of illiquid investment
    programs can provide you.  Think twice before commiting.'

- en: '**A strategy based on trend and momentum is capable of use by sophisticated
    individual investors.**  Following trends is a form of market timing strategy
    – one investment at a time.  Momentum strategy is normally used in a long-short
    strategy.  The easiest to implement is buying last years’ winners while simultaneously
    selling last years’ losers.  The reason these strategies work is based on psychology. 
    Most of us feel very comfortable investing after our portfolio has increased in
    value, not after the market has fallen. If we owned shares in a company and the
    price has declined we can hold on, we could sell or we could buy more.  Most individuals
    will hold or sell after a decline.  On the other hand, most investors want to
    buy more of a good thing and a good thing in common stocks, at least in our minds,
    is only if the shares have gone up in price.  These feelings, those of feeling
    good and buying more shares, or feeling bad and selling our shares, last for about
    a year.  Around this time is when fundamentals take over, quickly reversing any
    over or under valuation.  Following trends or using a momentum strategy has been
    shown to work, but has been almost impossible for an individual investor to follow. 
    It seems we hang on to our shares well beyond the time that the process works,
    allowing a full circle to complete in capturing zero return.  Personally, I feel
    very few people can successfully follow a trading strategy for long enough time
    to reap the rewards.  Ultimately fear or greed will enter our minds and take away
    any potential gain.'

- en: '**The final two strategies, value and volatility, should be understood and
    used if possible for your individual portfolios.**  Dr. Ilmanen uses insurance
    and lotteries to illustrate his thoughts on volatility.  Major volatility in the
    markets causes investors to overpay for insurance against downside volatility
    and at the other extreme, make a very risky investment in hopes of a substantial
    gain— both of which reduce expected returns.  This is what he says about insurance
    against market volatility:  *The best-known insurance strategies involve various
    methods of selling equity index volatility.  Doing so earns good long-run returns
    but at the risk of huge losses when bad times occur.*'
  prefs: []

    turns out that the most volatile assets within every asset class offer surprisingly
    poor long-term returns.*
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If the cost of insurance has exceeded the benefits and taking huge risks has
    had very little payoff, then what about the middle ground, where we accept some
    levels of risk in hopes of a small but meaningful increase in returns?  Dr. Ilmanen
    gives us the answer:  “Meanwhile, low-volatility assets offer surprisingly good
    returns for taking a small risk.  Defensive investments often provide the same
    or perhaps better risk adjusted returns than their more speculative peers.”

    But they also apply to bonds and CDs.  His studies also give us this information: 
    “…there is no reward for holding bonds with a maturity greater than five years
    and …that CCC rated bonds underperformed more highly rated credits.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Our own approach to investing in bonds and CDs has been to earn an average return
    of a five year yield over our lifetime.  The problem today is that the beginning
    rates on all fixed income obligations are so low that the payoff for extending
    maturities is not enough. When and if rates rise so that their current yield exceeds
    the expected inflation rate, then we will begin extending maturities in our balanced
    accounts.

    just seems to make sense**.  Being reassured by study after study that value investing
    pays, I was not surprised by Dr. Ilmanen’s inclusion of value as a strategy worthy
    of your consideration.  Value investing is simple to understand.  It is buying
    an asset (stock, bond or any other type you can think of) at a price less than
    you determine its real value is today.  This broad definition does not work very
    well in any type of academic study.  Since data on common stocks is easy to obtain,
    you will find that the majority of the academic studies on value investing is
    limited to this asset class.  In addition, most academic studies use a calculation
    of market price to the accounting book value of a company or the market price
    to the recent earnings of a company to identify value stocks.  Dr. Illmanen uses
    prices to book multiples.  According to Dr. Ilmanen the reason for the outperformance
    of value over time is behavioral.  Here is what he said:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*“Various behavioral interpretations, however, may offer more compelling explanations
    for the out-performance of value stocks.  Here is the main narrative.  Value investing
    works within markets and in many other contexts because of the overpricing of
    the hope for growth.  If there is high growth in a stock or sector or a country,
    investors tend to extrapolate further subsequent growth, resulting in high valuations. 
    Typically, this expectation is followed by disappointment in the growth rate and
    return”.*'

- en: '**Common sense tells us to “buy low and sell high”.  Why then, is it so difficult
    for each of us to accept that statement and put it to work for our benefits?** 
    Common stocks, especially individual common stocks, do not become low priced without
    a reason.  Knowing the reason, determining if it is real or temporary, and then
    estimating how long it will take to correct the problem, opens the door to many
    opportunities for error.  Most of us can understand the problems facing a company. 
    Most of us can judge whether that problem is temporary or real.  The reason most
    of us fail to be rewarded is that we cannot or will not hang on long enough for
    the problems to be corrected and reflected in a higher market price.'

    returns up and beyond the returns earned by U.S. Treasury Bills.  To have some
    meaning, he also provided the annualized volatility.  The beginning dates used
    for each return is when the data became available.  They range from 1900 for U.S.
    and World Stocks to 1990, the first year data on volatility was available.

    in order to obtain higher returns you will need to assume some risk.  What I find
    the most interesting of Dr. Ilmanen’s work is the reassurance to me that higher
    risk does not equate to higher returns.  Most of us are far better off in the
    middle of the risk/reward spectrum.  Sticking with quality stocks in combination
    with short to intermediate term bonds and CDs may not provide the highest short
    term returns.  But it could very easily provide you with the highest returns you
    could achieve over a lifetime.'
