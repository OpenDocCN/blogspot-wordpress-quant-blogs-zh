- en: We have not proven any new results, however, we have seen that a classical technique
    has a natural interpretation in terms of derivatives pricing.  With this interpretation
    the maximum principle becomes rather obvious. We have studied a rather simple
    special case, the flat Laplacian on R^n, however, it is clear that the techniques
    could easily be applied in a much wider range of cases
