- en: by computer scientist Dave Cliff on the complexity of today's global markets,
    their inherent dependence on technology and potential for catastrophic breakdown.
    This is based on a presentation he made to the UK government not long after the
    Flash Crash of 6 May 2010\. He offers a valuable perspective as someone who has
    been both closely involved with developing automated trading algorithms, and thought
    a great deal about the stability and potential for breakdown in large scale socio-technological
    systems -- that is, systems in which people and technology interact on a vast
    scale.

    complexity that we really lack an ability to understand. Blind faith in the self-regulation
    of the financial system is totally unwarranted, and the only way to avoid potential
    catastrophes is probably to use technology itself -- through very large scale
    simulations -- to try to foresee the kinds of problems likely to emerge. A few
    highlights of the argument:'

    technology has led us toward an era of crises through a fundamental dynamic, as
    our ability to build and depend on complex systems is vastly outpacing out ability
    to understand and manage such systems. This I think is beyond dispute. Cliff illustrates
    it with a suggestive graph, below:'

- en: Given this problem and it's obvious special relevance to finance (in view of
    the transformation of HFT over the past decade), Cliff then spends the rest of
    the text outlining a plausible approach to doing something about it. Mainly, he
    argues that economics and finance really need to turn to the approach that has
    been used already in the rest of science and engineering. That is, building plausible
    large scale simulation models to gain some insight into complex systems (such
    as the weather). As he notes, computation is widely used in finance, but usually
    to do things like pricing options, and less frequently to modelling entire markets.
    This is slowly changing, however, despite the resistance of the traditional economics
    community.

- en: I've argued similar things elsewhere (in less detail and not as convincingly).
    The question is whether governments on a global scale have the will to do this
    in the face of the financial industry, which seems to quite enjoy there being
    less understanding of global risks rather than more.
