    quoted of all the volatility indices. It measures the market’s expectations of
    the volatility in the S&P 500 index (SPX) for the next 30 calendar days. Unbeknownst
    to many (despite my efforts), the VIX also has a lesser known sibling that measures
    the volatility expectations in the SPX for the next 93 calendar days: [VXV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXV).'

- en: In addition to the volatility indices, there are also markets for [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures);
    lately these have extended out eight or nine months into the future. Whereas the
    VIX and VXV evaluate volatility over the full course of a future window, the VIX
    futures are the market’s best guess at what the VIX will be at various snapshots
    into the future.  *[The distinction is not that dissimilar to the snapshot of
    a balance sheet vs. the flows in an income statement or a cash flow statement
    in accounting.]*  For this reason, it is certainly possible that an index which
    measures volatility over the next 93 calendar days may come up with a different
    value than a VIX futures product in which market participants attempt to estimate
    what the VIX will be at a specific point in time some 93 days later.

    based on the [implied volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/implied%20volatility)
    of a strip of SPX options) and the VIX futures (whose values are based on market
    prices) holds together fairly well.

    futures values for comparable time periods. In the graphic below, the VIX futures
    [term structure](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/term%20structure)
    (or at least the first eight months of it) is represented by the blue line, while
    the VIX and VXV are the red dots and dotted connecting line resting substantially
    below the VIX futures values.

    price discrepancies. Everyone, however, is free to ponder the source of the disconnect
    between SPX options traders and VIX futures traders.
