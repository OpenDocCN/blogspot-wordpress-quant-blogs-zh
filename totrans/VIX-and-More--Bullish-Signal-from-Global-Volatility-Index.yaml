- en: '*VIX and More*’s proprietary [Global Volatility Index](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Global%20Volatility%20Index)
    has been a big hit since I [unveiled it](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/11/introducing-vix-and-more-global.html)
    in November, which means that I will periodically update it and flag interesting
    developments in this space going forward.'

- en: At the close of Friday’s session, the difference between the Global Volatility
    Index and the VIX had narrowed to its lowest level since October and the premium
    percentage (the GVI divided by the VIX) was at its second lowest level ever. I
    consider this to be a bullish signal.

- en: In the chart below, I have marked the previous highs and lows in the premium
    percentage with red and green arrows. The red arrow marking the high comes from
    the first week in December 2007 and was an excellent opportunity to sell or get
    short. The green arrow from late October was an early bottom. In the months that
    have followed, the [Dow Jones World Stock Index](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Dow%20Jones%20World%20Stock%20Index)
    has largely marked time. While this indicator is still relatively young and untested,
    I consider Friday’s second lowest reading to reinforce or confirm the October
    buy signal.
