    but this week’s honor goes to the U.S. [Dollar](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/dollar),
    which saw its largest one week drop in percentage terms in at least 25 years.

- en: As the chart below shows, the dollar has been negatively correlated to stocks
    for the past five months or so. Historically, a falling dollar has generally not
    been positive for stocks. It will, however, provide some support for exporters
    and enhance demand for commodities that are quoted in dollars across the globe.

  zh: 如下面的图表所示，过去五个月左右，美元与股票的走势呈现负相关。历史上，美元的下跌通常对股市并不利。然而，这将为出口商提供一些支持，并增强全球范围内以美元计价的大宗商品的需求。
- en: For the most part, the strength of the dollar usually reflects traders’ opinions
    about the strength of the U.S. economy relative to economies associated with the
    other major [currencies](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/currencies).
    When the dollar was rising, therefore, it was not necessarily a vote of confidence
    in the U.S. economy as much as it reflected a concern that other nations may be
    in an even more difficult situation. Now with the mushrooming U.S. debt on top
    of an already severe economic crisis, the prospects for the U.S. economy relative
    to that of some of other global economies is being reevaluated from one of the
    strongest to perhaps only slightly better than average.

  zh: 美元的强势通常反映了交易者对美国经济相对于其他主要货币经济的强度的看法。因此，当美元上升时，这并不是对美国经济的信心投票，而更多的是反映了对其他国家可能面临更困难情况的担忧。现在，随着美国债务的激增和已经严重的经济危机，美国经济相对于一些其他全球经济的前景正在从最强变为可能只是略好于平均水平。
- en: The dollar appreciated approximately 23% from July to November. This week the
    dollar moved below its 50 day moving average for the first time since the July
    bullish move again. Trend indicators such as the [Aroon](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/06/Aroon.asp)
    are starting to reflect a reversal in trend; expect trend-following systems to
    be short the dollar as the new trend becomes more pronounced.

  zh: 从7月到11月，美元汇率上涨了大约23%。本周，美元再次自7月以来的涨势以来首次跌破了50日均线。像[Aroon](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/06/Aroon.asp)这样的趋势指标开始显示出趋势反转的迹象；随着新趋势变得更加明显，预计趋势跟随系统将会做空美元。
