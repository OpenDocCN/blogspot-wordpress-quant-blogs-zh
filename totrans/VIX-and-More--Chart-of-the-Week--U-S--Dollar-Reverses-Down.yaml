- en: There were many strong candidates for the [chart of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week),
    but this week’s honor goes to the U.S. [Dollar](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/dollar),
    which saw its largest one week drop in percentage terms in at least 25 years.

- en: As the chart below shows, the dollar has been negatively correlated to stocks
    for the past five months or so. Historically, a falling dollar has generally not
    been positive for stocks. It will, however, provide some support for exporters
    and enhance demand for commodities that are quoted in dollars across the globe.

    about the strength of the U.S. economy relative to economies associated with the
    other major [currencies](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/currencies).
    When the dollar was rising, therefore, it was not necessarily a vote of confidence
    in the U.S. economy as much as it reflected a concern that other nations may be
    in an even more difficult situation. Now with the mushrooming U.S. debt on top
    of an already severe economic crisis, the prospects for the U.S. economy relative
    to that of some of other global economies is being reevaluated from one of the
    strongest to perhaps only slightly better than average.

- en: The dollar appreciated approximately 23% from July to November. This week the
    dollar moved below its 50 day moving average for the first time since the July
    bullish move again. Trend indicators such as the [Aroon](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/06/Aroon.asp)
    are starting to reflect a reversal in trend; expect trend-following systems to
    be short the dollar as the new trend becomes more pronounced.
