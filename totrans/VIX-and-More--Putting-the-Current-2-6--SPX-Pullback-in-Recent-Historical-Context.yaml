    three years ago today – I have periodically been posting a table of the most significant
    pullbacks in the S&P 500 index since that March 2009 bottom. For the record, the
    current 2.6% decline over four days is barely enough to get it to qualify as one
    of those 16 pullbacks.

    marks to the eventual trough as the basis for calculating the magnitude and duration
    of the pullbacks.

    the median pullback during the last three years has lasted 7 trading days and
    dropped the SPX a total of 5.6%. Were we to see a median pullback form this time
    around, it would suggest a bottom of about SPX 1301 sometime on Friday after the
    employment report.

    would put the SPX back to the 1275-1279 range, while a ‘pullback’ that would be
    comparable to the May-October decline from 2011 would set the SPX back all the
    way to about 1080.
