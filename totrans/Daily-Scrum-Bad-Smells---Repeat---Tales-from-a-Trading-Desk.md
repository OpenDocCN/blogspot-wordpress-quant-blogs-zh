## Daily Scrum Bad Smells – Repeat

So again we venture down the road of daily scrum [bad](http://scrumcrazy.wordpress.com/2010/09/18/bad-smells-of-the-daily-scrum/) [smells](http://martinfowler.com/articles/itsNotJustStandingUp.html).  All to often the board is updated or the electronic board is updated during the scrum, focusing the team on a more admin task than anything else.  Classic madness.  Other classic’s are simple to resolve – get the burn-down on the wall, and make sure everyone is clear as to the over arching theme/goal of the sprint.

One of the biggest issues of the scrum is lack of participation – turning up late, and just looking bored.  The scrum is for the team, the team should feel they benefit from the scrum, not that its a chore.
