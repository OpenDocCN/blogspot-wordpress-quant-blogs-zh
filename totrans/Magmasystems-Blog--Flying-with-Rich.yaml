- en: I went flying this past weekend with Rich. It was very windy. It was so windy
    that, when we pointed the nose directly into the wind and put down the flaps,
    we were able to make the plane go backwards in the air.

- en: Rich flew co-pilot in my Mooney 20G. Rich owns a very big mutual fund. Rich
    has a [TBM 700](http://www.socata.eads.net/1024/en/aircraft/TBM%20700/TBM700.html).
    I hope I fly Rich's plane some day.

    never mix, and friendship is always more important. Silly Marc.
