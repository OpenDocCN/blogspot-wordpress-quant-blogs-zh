## Thoughts on OData

I was at the Microsoft OData [Roadshow](http://www.odata.org/roadshow) today which 11 people attended, driven by [Douglas Purdy](http://www.douglaspurdy.com/) and [Jonathan Carter](http://www.lostintangent.com/) (Building 3, Microsoft Reading). Nice to see Douglas had an iPad üôÇ

*   The WebAPI is the centre of the world
*   [NetFlix](http://odata.netflix.com/) was used as the OData service for most of the morning discussion
*   OData filters via the URL is pretty [cool](http://odata.netflix.com/Catalog/Titles?Sfilter=AverageRating%20gt%204%20and%20ReleaseYear%20eq%202008)
*   Pages, Top, [Select](http://odata.netflix.com/Catalog/Titles('BVeKh')), etc are supported by OData
*   Today you can‚Äôt plug your own MIME types into OData so you are stuck with the usual suspects ‚Äì JSON etc
*   Edm data model is used as per Entity Framework
*   [Metadata](http://odata.netflix.com/Catalog/%24metadata) is accessible on an OData service
*   History of OData: ASMX -> WS* -> OData. Microsoft bet on XML (WS*) but it was possible the wrong bet. OData is a bet on HTTP. OData is browser friendly!
*   Open Data Protocol = HTTP/ATOM + QUERY + JSON + METADATA
*   [IBM](http://www.douglaspurdy.com/2010/01/28/websphere-extreme-scale-supports-odata/) has implemented OData on WebSphere
*   [LINQPad](http://dougfinke.com/blog/index.php/2009/12/16/new-linqpad-beta-supports-data-in-the-cloud-odata/) has [OData](http://odataprimer.com/Default.aspx?Page=UseLinqPadToQueryODataServiceWithLINQ&NS=&AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1) support üôÇ
*   OData Objective-C library is available for iPad support
*   When adding an OData service to Visual Studio (Service reference) you can select the ‚ÄúView Diagram‚Äù menu option to generate a nice metadata view of the service
*   MSFT has a standardised wireform for Expression Trees (LINQ to URL) enabling LINQ Expression tree to OData Url syntax and the reverse on the server
*   Had a very brief discussion with Jonathan around how finance is building RIA using streaming servers instead of web services. Net out Microsoft is going after the 80% data case, and streaming (push) of data in the financial world (real-time web) is a small subset of the world today and hence very not in the current vision
*   SQL Azure OData [Services](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/netservices/archive/2010/04/20/how-to-use-the-odata-for-sql-azure-with-appfabric-access-control.aspx)
*   Custom [IQueryable](http://weblogs.asp.net/cibrax/archive/2010/03/15/odata-to-the-rescue-exposing-the-eventlog-as-a-data-feed.aspx) OData is of most interest from my perspective
*   Windows [‚ÄúDallas‚Äù](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsazure/dallas/) ‚Äì The iTunes store for data. Provides security, business model and hosting. There are a number of data [provides](https://www.sqlazureservices.com/Catalog.aspx) leveraging this infrastructure today, curious to see if a financial services gets on this bandwagon (maybe from a trade research perspective)
*   Douglas personal view appears to be that the web (browser) is the only cross platform solution. Steve Jobs and his Adobe Flash would therefore appear to be the correct view ‚Äì HTML5 and open web standards. Adobe Flash and Microsoft Silverlight (the RIA world) are native platforms). Hence OData is betting on HTTP, and is geared to the web.
