    week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week) entry.
    Once again there were quite a few very strong entries. Perhaps because I have
    lately been focusing much of my trading research and development in the area of
    volume and perhaps because I see so little top notch analysis of volume patterns,
    I found Charlie’s chart to be particularly compelling. Also, I tend to place most
    of my emphasis on short and intermediate-term data and analysis in this blog –
    and given the events of the past month or so, I think the present is an excellent
    time to step back and view the investment landscape with a wide angle lens.

    and $NYDNV is the total volume of all declining stocks on the NYSE. The green
    bars thus represent a ratio of $NYDNV to $NYUPV. The [TRIN](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TRIN)
    is also known as the Arms Index. I discuss the how the index is calculated in
    [Bullish TRIN as Year Winds Down](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/12/bullish-trin-as-year-winds-down.html).
