# Timely Portfolio: Exploring Factors with rCharts and factorAnalytics

Fama and French changed the financial world with their [factors in 1993](http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=12390788233497435001&hl=en&as_sdt=0,1).  Another duo Andrea Frazzini and Lasse Heje Pedersen have expanded our world with their [Betting Against Beta (BAB) and Quality Minus Junk (QMJ)  factors](http://www.econ.yale.edu/~af227/).  The combined factor set of Fama/French and Frazzini/Pedersen provides substantial insight into the historical performance of equities in the US and around the world.

Fortunately for us, the authors have also made available their factors.  ~~Unfortunately, BAB and QMJ are not updated like the Fama/French SMB and HML~~. (actually discovered this is no longer true [Frazzini data library](http://www.econ.yale.edu/~af227/data_library.htm))  Still though, combining these factors with the R packages factorAnalytics and rCharts allows us to do some amazing things.  Here is a quick example. Look for more soon.
