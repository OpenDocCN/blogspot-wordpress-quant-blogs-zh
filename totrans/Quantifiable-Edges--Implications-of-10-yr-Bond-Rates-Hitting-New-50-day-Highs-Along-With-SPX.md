# Quantifiable Edges: Implications of 10-yr Bond Rates Hitting New 50-day Highs Along With SPX

Ten year bond rates hit a new 50-day high on Thursday in conjunction with the 50-day high in the SPX.  This is something I have looked at in the past, and the intermediate-term implications suggest possible difficulty.  I’ve shown this study a few times on the blog, most recently last October 31st.  The last time it triggered was March 13th.  I have updated the results below.

Generally it seems that higher interest rates have often made bonds an attractive investment. This may have lead people to forsake stocks in favor of lower risk returns with improved yield.  Of course the “high” yield we are now seeing certainly does not seem high.  Still, this study has triggered a number of times over the last several years and it continues to suggest struggles for the SPX.  So it seems worth being aware of.
