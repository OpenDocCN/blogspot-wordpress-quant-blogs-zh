- en: I believe that the NY Times interactive feature [512 Paths to the White House](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/11/02/us/politics/paths-to-the-white-house.html?_r=0)
    is one of the best visualizations of all time.  It is even better when we have
    details on the [process of creating this marvel](http://chartsnthings.tumblr.com/post/35616801795/some-sketches-from-the-times-scenario-builder).  
    Although the graphic is not suited for other data sources (please tell me if this
    is not correct), I just could not resist using the amazing R packages [slidify](http://slidify.org)
    and [rCharts](https://github.com/ramnathv/rCharts) from [Ramnath Vaidyanathan](https://github.com/ramnathv)
    to build it from R.  I wouldn’t have even thought it possible until I saw his
    tutorial [Replicating NY Times Interactive Graphic](http://ramnathv.github.io/rChartsNYT/)
    and his demo [Visualizing the Reinhart and Rogoff Public Debt Study](http://glimmer.rstudio.com/ramnathv/rChartsRogoff/).

    with Ramnath’s brilliance by the end of the year 2013\. He might even convince
    some d3 users to try a little R.

- en: Even more amazing is the entire tutorial embedded below (click [here](http://timelyportfolio.github.io/rCharts_512paths/)
    if it does not appear) is created in R with [slidify](http://slidify.org), so
    it is entirely reproducible.  rCharts is early in development, but I urge you
    to try it out.
