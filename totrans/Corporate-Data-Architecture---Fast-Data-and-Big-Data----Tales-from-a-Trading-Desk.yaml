- en: The VoltDB [blog](http://voltdb.com/blog/the-alchemy-of-fast-data) has a number
    of interesting articles on Corporate Data Architecture.  The Fast Data [stack](http://voltdb.com/blog/designing-a-data-architecture-to-support-both-fast-and-big-data)
    is somewhat different from a [lambda](http://radar.oreilly.com/2014/07/questioning-the-lambda-architecture.html)
    architecture that has been discussed on various blog in the context of real-time
    big data.  Clearly Fast Data is a VoltDB database based on VoltDB’s view of the
    world. However, [summingbird](https://github.com/twitter/summingbird) and other
    such stacks also have merit.  As does [samza](http://samza.incubator.apache.org/)
    and Kafka.
