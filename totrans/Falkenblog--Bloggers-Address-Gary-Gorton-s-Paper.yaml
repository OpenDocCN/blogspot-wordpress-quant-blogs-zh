    crisis was. If you were totally outside it, or just calling for some unspecified
    disaster, it is tempting to see the crisis as something really obvious (eg, outlaw
    greed, hubris, and poorly targeted regulation).

    distills a different key point. Part of this group dynamic is simply specialization,
    where people focus on their unique insights because they want to say something
    new (interesting ideas are important, true and

    else says (eg, there were regulatory failures) excepting the priority of the concerns.

- en: First, I would agree with Dr. Manhattan that regulation has a poor batting average
    in the financial sector, and merely saying our new regulators should be smart,
    disinterested, and hardworking is like saying our political leaders should be
    so to. They aren't, and never have been. Highlight a specific regulatory idea,
    because merely calling for 'more' only ensures that it will be more of the same.

- en: Secondly, Kwak and Klein get it backward when they first describe a repo secured
    by an 'informationally insensitive' derivative, then talk about a bank run caused
    by investors afraid that the bank will default. In the repo problem described
    by Gorton, the repo collateral-- mortgage securities rated AAA -- is what became
    risky or 'informationally sensitive'. This was the basis of the contraction, the
    prime mover, which lead to Bear and AIG's collapse, not Bear and AIG leading to
    mortgage problems. The causation arrow's direction is very important for both
    diagnosis and potential cures.

    as it encourages the belief that investing is riskless. I agree, but I don't think
    it is possible to think investors will not create some new 'riskless' time bomb
    in the future. The situation is, like Minsky's

    circa 2006\. For example, at the 5 year point, A-rated bonds trade at 170 basis
    points over Treasuries, the same spread BB-rated bonds traded at in June 2006\.
    Historically, A-rated bonds have about a 0.1% annualized default rate, BB a 1.15%
    annualized default rate, so currently people don''t think anything is riskless.'

- en: After another 50 years of no defaults, the new AAA asset securities will be
    of two types. An asset class with an even longer period of no default, like US
    Treasury debt, or the next generation of mortgage backed securities, which will
    have explicitly addressed the issues relevant to this current crisis. In the latter
    case, a reasonable argument can be made that such securities should not include
    the 2007-8 scenario in their future default rate expectations because there has
    been a structural change specifically rectifying the mistakes so that the 2007-8
    scenario is no longer relevant (eg, all mortgage ABS now includes a 50% collateral
    value collapse as having a 3% probability, unlike previously).

    rates is a waste of time, like worrying about World Wars. Sure, they happen, but
    they are always different, you probably will have no control, and for most people
    they won't experience such a crisis here their entire working life. So the asset
    becomes, through no mandate or official diktat, money, and through the money multiplier,
    a keystone in any future financial collapse. If people generally believe an asset
    is AAA, it will be treated like money endogenously through the process Gorton
    outlines. Such assets do not acquire this characteristic merely by a rating agency,
    people actually believe it is true using all of their insight. They are usually
    write, but not always.

    stable property rights, and accept that growing economies will have recessions.

    policies exceeds by far the potential from further improvements in short-run demand
    management". The current crisis is short term demand management. The mistakes,
    with hindsight, are obvious and should be addressed. But the general take-away
    should not be how to prevent anything like this from happening again, because
    it is going to happen again in spite or because of anything we do now. Remember,
    crashes are endogenous, but so are recoveries.
