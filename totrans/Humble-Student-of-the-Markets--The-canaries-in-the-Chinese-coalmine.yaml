    China’s corporate sector, which exceeded 120% of GDP at end-2011 and has kept
    rising throughout 2012\. As the crisis progressed, non-performing loans would
    undoubtedly rise beyond the capacity of local governments to contain them, as
    their fiscal resources dwindled.

    as a knee-jerk reaction, while the authorities rushed to draft a decisive response.
    The rapid development of the non-bank credit market in the last few years, especially
    shadow banking activities, has created a new vector through which a systemic liquidity
    crunch could take place. Capital outflow would likely ensue, stretching domestic
    liquidity conditions further.

    day. The timing of that downturn is uncertain. I have no idea of whether it will
    happen this year, next year or in the next 5 years. When that cyclical downturn
    is upon us, however, China's export sensitive economy may not be resilient enough
    to withstand the slowdown. The result will not be just a hard landing (subpar
    growth of less than 6%), but possible a crash landing (negative GDP growth) that
    is not in anybody's spreadsheet.

    major trade partners and commodity prices and the ensuing tail risk will be in
