- en: '"Meh!"    **GE: Flat top-line growth** The GE earnings report was a solid report
    for shareholders, but I was not looking at it from a shareholder perspective,
    but using it to look for clues of global, or at least American, capex acceleration.
    The presentation, which can be found [here](http://www.ge.com/sites/default/files/ge_webcast_presentation_04172014_0.pdf),
    left me a little wanting.   In particular, this page showing the progression of
    their order backlog was a little disappointing. Backlog growth from 4Q to 1Q was
    flat, having increased from $23.6 billion to $23.7 billion.     The oil and gas
    division provided much of the source of capex growth, but that should be no surprise.
    David Kostin of Goldman Sachs broke out capex by sector and showed that the energy
    sector had been increasing its share of capex within the SP 500 for several quarters
    (via [Business Insider](http://www.businessinsider.com/capex-spending-by-industry-2014-2)).
    While there were some bright spots in the other GE divisions, there appears to
    be no broad based capex acceleration an ex-energy basis.  **Little sales growth
    at Honeywell either**'

    earnings but missed on sales (remember we are looking for sales acceleration).
    Sales was up only 1% on an organic basis YoY. The environment in the Defense and
    Space division was problematical and HON saw good top-line acceleration in Europe
    from sales of their turbochargers.'

    quarter and 4% in the 2H2014, ex-Defense and Space. While they did raise earnings

    but it falls short of a picture of capex acceleration that the Street has been
    expecting. The same comment would also apply to GE. To top it all off, Bill McBride
