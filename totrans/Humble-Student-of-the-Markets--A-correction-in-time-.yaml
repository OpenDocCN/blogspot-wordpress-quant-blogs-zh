- en: For several weeks, I have been calling for a choppy sideways market, but the
    S&P 500 continues its upward grind. To be sure, the index pulled back about 2%
    last week and briefly tested its 50 dma, but its upward trajectory has been relentless.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A discussion with another chartist raised the possibility that the market has
    been undergoing a stealth correction. As good technicians know, corrections can
    occur in price or in time. Beneath the surface, market internals have been correcting
    in both price and time. My equity risk appetite models have been trading sideways
    for much of this year.

    has made fresh highs during the current advance, other versions of the A-D Line
    have been flat to weak. The weakest have been the NASDAQ and the S&P 600 small-cap
    A-D Lines.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The tactical outlook is more constructive. Even as the S&P 500 tested the 50
    dma and made a marginal low last Friday, all of the A-D Lines except for the S&P
    500 did not make a fresh low.
