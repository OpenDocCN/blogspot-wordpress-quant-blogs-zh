    weeks. While I am still inclined to give the bull case the benefit of the doubt,
    my analysis of relative leadership (see

- en: For the bulls, I can suggest looking at Homebuilders and Gold miners. The Homebuilding
    group has been on a tear since last October. Gold stocks have been rallying presumably
    on the assumption that the latest round of global quantitative easing by central
    bankers amount to competitive devaluation and gold bullion is a beneficiary because
    of its status as an alternative currency.

    Care for their defensive qualities. Telecom stocks have been beating the stock
    market since May, which makes it an ideal candidate for investment regardless
    of market climate. Health Care has shown itself to be the leadership in this current
    sideways consolidation period and would likely outperform should stocks decline
    further.

    against the market (top panel) and the stock market (bottom panel). Homebuilders
    bottomed out on a relative basis last October and they have been rallying on a
    relative basis ever since. Currently the group is testing a relative support level,
    but the relative uptrend remains intact. The Fed's QE3 program specifically targets
    the MBS market, which should benefit the housing sector. This is a signal to get
    long and don't fight the Fed.

    downtrend line in late August and they have been in a relative uptrend ever since.
    Gold should benefit from the latest trend of quantitative easing by central banks
    around the world, which amount to competitive devaluation that benefits the value
    of gold as an alternative currency.

    independent of market direction. Telecom, which sports a higher than market yield,
    is usually thought of as being somewhat defensive in nature. Nevertheless, this
    sector has been leading the market since May. It remains in a relative uptrend
    and did not lag when the stock market began to run in June. This sector, along
    with the Homebuilders analyzed above, form the secular leadership in the stock
    market.

    in a down market, Health Care is a leading candidate. The sector has been rallying
    on a relative basis in the current sideways consolidation period. Should the market
    go lower, it will likely emerging as a leadership sector.
