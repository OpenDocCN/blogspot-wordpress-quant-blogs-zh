    the expense of longer term ones. Now, that's easy to see with hindsight applied
    to various trades we all should have made in 2007 (where were the NYTimes articles
    castigating easy mortgages prior to 2007?), but I would say that the private sector
    is much better at stopping things that have only good short-term effects than
    government. For example, only

    teaching those classic virtues of courage and discipline, and like hockey is more
    responsive to practice than sports like football and basketball that are more
    reliant on exceptional genetics. This year's Olympics were fun to watch because
    the two US champions both had signature moves they reached for repeatedly (for
    Jake Varner the ankle pick, for Jordan Burroughs the double leg). They highlighted
    a key to success is not being best at everything, but rather, having a specialty.
     Another life skill.

    changing. For instance, this year there were two bronze medal winners in each
    weight. In 2004 Women's wrestling was added. There are now three separate periods,
    so scores are not cumulative (eg, you can win by having periods go 1-6, 1-0, 1-0).
    A five-point throw automatically wins a period.

    few of these rules made the sport that much better to watch (the tie-breaking
    rules are insanely lame). Olympic wrestling is still a niche sport because scoring
    is still too subtle, which makes it hard for outsiders to appreciate.

    (K-1, ExiteXC, Strikeforce, WEC), so the one with better excitement prospered.
    The basic product, human combat, is a perennial, so it was really about combining
    well-known sports (jiu jitsu, wrestling and boxing) into a single one.
