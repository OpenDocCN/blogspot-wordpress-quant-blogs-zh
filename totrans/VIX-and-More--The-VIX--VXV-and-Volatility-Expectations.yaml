- en: I am frequently asked to provide more commentary on [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures)
    and the extent to which expectations for future volatility as indicated by VIX
    futures contrasts sharply with the cash or spot VIX.  While I think this is a
    worthwhile exercise, I am not a big fan of the various charts that I can easily
    put my hands on, including [this one](http://futuresource.quote.com/charts/charts.jsp?s=VX%20Q8-CF&o=%24VIX&a=D&z=800x550&d=LOW&b=LINE&st=)
    from FutureSource.com (which can be easily edited) that compares the August 2008
    VIX futures with the cash VIX.  The FutureSouce.com chart in the link above, for
    instance, uses different Y-axis values for the futures and the cash market, making
    comparisons a little too murky for my taste.

    which is analogous to the VIX except that it uses a 93 day time horizon in lieu
    of the 30 day time frame of the VIX.  Better yet, the VXV is supported by my favorite
    chart service, StockCharts.com, which makes it easy to provide a wide range of
    customizable comparisons of the VIX and the VXV.

- en: Launched three months ago, the [VXV chart](http://stockcharts.com/charts/gallery.html?%24VXV)
    finally has a critical mass of data that makes it easier to identify trends.  My
    interest, however, is not so much the VXV in a vacuum as it is compared to the
    VIX.  Hence the [VIX:VXV ratio](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%3AVXV),
    which is what the chart below captures.  While it is still relatively early to
    have high confidence trading rules for this ratio, my [working hypothesis](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/12/vixvxv-ratio.html)
    continues to be that this ratio will be [mean reverting](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/mean%20reversion)
    around 1.00, with the best long entries (for the SPX or other long instruments)
    when the ratio drops below 0.90 and the best short entries when the ratio rises
    above 1.10.

- en: In addition to the extreme values that the VIX:VXV ratio generates as trading
    signals, some of the middling values may also have interpretive value.  As I type
    this, for instance, the ratio sits at 0.997, suggesting that there is no discernable
    difference between volatility expectations over the next 30 days and over a 93
    day period.  Said another way, today’s rally does not seem to have put the VIX
    in an ‘oversold’ mode, at least relative to future volatility expectations.
