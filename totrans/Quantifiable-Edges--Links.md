# Quantifiable Edges: Links

> 来源：[http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2009/01/links.html#0001-01-01](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2009/01/links.html#0001-01-01)

I’m a little under the weather today, so rather than producing research myself, I’ve decided to add a few links to the blogroll and point out some recent articles I found interesting.

First the articles:

From Active Trader Mag I recently came across

[this interesting article](http://store.activetradermag.com/futures_tsl1105.pdf)

which places bands around RSI levels rather than looking at absolute levels.

Market Rewind with tests of

[consistently oversold](http://marketrewind.blogspot.com/2009/01/rsi-mon-sez-think-ahead.html)

and

[overbought](http://marketrewind.blogspot.com/2009/01/this-pullback-was-overdue.html)

RSI readings. Incidentally, one feature of the new Market Rewind ETF tools shows 5-day historical short-term RSI’s on a massive number of sortable ETF’s. I’ve beta-tested the tool. ETF traders should definitely check it out when it goes live.

Can’t get enough RSI talk? Check out

and

[Woodshedder](http://www.ibankcoin.com/woodshedderblog/index.php/2009/01/11/depressed-relative-strength-bulls-have-the-edge/)

.

For those looking to improve their intraday trading, it’s not uncommon that Traderfeed comes up with

[a gem like this one](http://traderfeed.blogspot.com/2009/01/defining-profit-targets-and-formulating.html)

last week.

Now few a few blogroll additions that are long overdue:

[Behind the Headlines](http://quicktakespro.blogspot.com/)

– Barrons columnist Michael Kahn offers more insights on his blog.

[Skill Analytics](http://skillanalytics.wordpress.com/)

– Would’ve thrown this one up there a while ago but he just didn’t post that often. Postings have picked up recently and he now provides a nice ETF correlation tool as well.

[The Deipnosophist](http://eutrapelia.blogspot.com/)

– Smart reading about the market.

I’ll save further additions for another sick day.
