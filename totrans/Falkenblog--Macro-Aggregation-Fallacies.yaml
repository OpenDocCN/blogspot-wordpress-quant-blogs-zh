    oil tanker using a few inputs. Sure, it's hard to steer an oil tanker, but it's
    feasible. You just need an objective (full employment!), inputs (a map and a clear
    view), and control variables (the rudder, engine speed). After all, Newton took
    all those epicycles, and merged them into simple F=G*m

    interest rate. He uses graph above to show that the higher the interest rate,
    the more the private sector--consumers plus the businesses they own--will save.

    surplus at zero, or no larger than the public sector deficit, thus ensuring full

- en: In stressed times after a bubble (eg, the 'after' line above), the private sector
    tries to run a big surplus as it pays down debt. This causes recessions, which
    can be mitigated if not eliminated via countercyclical budget deficits by the
    public sector.

    it has been tried over and over and if a government could spend itself to prosperity
    and stability, a couple such countries would demonstrate this. Instead, we have
    the examples of the contrary, where fiscal restraint and modest automatic stabilizers
    were consistent with the wealthier countries post WW-II.

    and employment, and simply thinks that people and companies are saving 'too much',
    and so anti-savings by the government would offset this, leading to full-employment
    bliss. That kind of thinking is profoundly misleading.
