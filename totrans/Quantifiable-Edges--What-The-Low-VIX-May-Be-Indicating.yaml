- en: With all the recent volatility in the market, many traders have noted the recent
    low VIX levels and wondered if that was a sign of complacency. Low VIX readings
    relative to their short-term moving averages do sometimes presage market pullbacks.
    While one use of the VIX is trying to predict the direction of the market. That
    really isn’t what the VIX represents. It represents options traders perception
    of future volatility. So perhaps the low VIX means they know something?

- en: One of the most unusual aspects of the recent environment is how volatile it
    has been in a virtually trendless market. Wild swings within a range. Lots of
    chop. To quantify this action I took the 14-day ADX of the SPX (15.56) and divided
    it by the 14-day historical volatility (volatilitystddev in Tradestation terms),
    which currently stands at 0.3023\. The result (about 51) is what I call trend
    over volatility (TOV). Charting this helps to see other times where volatility
    was high and the market wasn’t trending.

    compelling enough for a directional bet on its own. (Combined with my other recent
    studies it may be.)

    The yellow line is ADX. The blue line is Historical Volatility. The vertical line
    shows when the TOV dropped to 55 or lower. (Click charts to enlarge.)

- en: The one thing that stuck out to me? In every case, at some point in the next
    month there was a sharp drop in historical volatility. In ’87 and ’88 it took
    about 3 weeks. The other times it was almost immediate. Does the VIX know something?
    It just might.
