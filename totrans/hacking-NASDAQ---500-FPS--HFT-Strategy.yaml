    lost this round but just one of many to come. Decided to target pure FPGA strategies
    as it plays to my strengths  - hardcore tech (yes can code verilog) & need team
    up for that,  but more on that later.

- en: 'Above is March 2012 worth of accumulated PnL, horizontal axis is # trades,
    vertical axis is accumulated dollars. In this case it makes about $4K / month
    on a single symbol on roughly 4M shares / month of volume, which is about $80MM/month
    of trades. On the day-to-day basis 90% of the time the PnL is flat or positive
    doing about 100-200 trades per day - keep in mind this is only 1 symbol out of
    many. Its simulated with full trade & quote data + liquidity rebates, commissions and
    latency discussed later.'

    queue is fairly simple and there`s some weirdness in the matching engine I haven`t
    worked out thus isn`t modeled. The only way to know is trade it for real... which
    I dont have the infra for.

- en: The theory goes $4K/month for 1 symbol,  find 10 symbols makes it $40K/month,
    20 symbols $80K/month etc all is good. Thus go out, signup for an eTrade/IB account
    and trade your way to $100M return in a year... or NOT.

- en: HFT strategies are either highly sensitive to latency, commissions or both,
    so lets explore. First up latency.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The above plots show the monthly PnL with a -1.25 commission at various levels
    of simulated latency. From top to bottom its, 0usec, 100usec, 250usec, 500usec, 1msec, 2msec, 5msec, 10msec, 100msec.
    Thats a pretty broad spectrum. Whats clear is the variance dramatically changes
    from a 100usec latency to a 100msec latency aka the return gets very "lumpy" something
    you really don`t want.

    $2,341, 100msec $1,978.

    e.g. dont trade on 100msec of latency!'

- en: If you look closely the number of trades slightly decreases then increases with
    the higher latency, the reason? Its a passive strategy thus if your too slow when
    the world moves you get hit by a bus because your sleeping in the middle of the
    road... instead of running to the other side. Resulting in a alot of unfavorable
    trades. In tennis I guess this is called "unforced errors".

    IB account hooked up to say Amazon EC2 & even if the everything is Java(.. ducks..)
    we should be well under 100msec tick to trade.. all good.

    the PnL look like? ......

    top to bottom of 0, -1, -5, -10, -15, -20 per share. As you can see @ -1 myri
    / share its a solid green, -5 its a bit shaky yet still firmly in the green.  At
    -10 myri/share its in trouble and it just goes down hill from there.'

    of the game your playing. For IB something like 100msec & -20myri / share which
    gives...

    $250K - $1MM to invest and doing alot of volume every day... which looks like.
