    about the future of their profession and key topics for future research.

    in their eyes, faces its key challenges in 1) understanding the nature of economic
    development and growth, and how the world's poor can be brought out of poverty,
    2) learning how our growing understanding of human behavioral psychology can be
    used to replace the inadequate framework of rationality in economics, 3) gaining
    a much better perspective on macroeconomics, including bubble and herding phenomena,
    4) building a new theoretical perspective to handle the vast influence of new
    information technology on human economic decisions and 5) learning to deal with
    massive data.

    two of the economists make semi-explicit their view that economics dearly needs
    to explore new kinds of models going beyond the equilibrium framework.

    rather narrow, conservative scope expressed in their comments. Perhaps this is
    to be expected from young economists hoping to find stable jobs for coming decades,
    but not one of them even mentions the need for a deeper understanding of the nature
    and long term consequences of economic growth. Such growth is -- still -- simply
    assumed to be an absolute good to be pursued always and as rapidly as it can be.
    Given the alarming picture painted by studies such as

    virtually all global biological and geophysical processes -- you might think that
    young economists would be scrambling to develop ideas about human society in a
    post-growth world, or at least one in which growth has to be strongly constrained
    and managed.

    any physical laws or biological realities, still seems to be a core belief even
    of the next generation of economists.
