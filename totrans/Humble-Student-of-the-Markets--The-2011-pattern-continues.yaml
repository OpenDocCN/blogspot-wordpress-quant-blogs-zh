    on Friday. Those that have fought the recent rally can list a plethora or reasons
    why the recent high is bearish; however, let there be no mistake that closing
    at highs is bullish as it has been in every other instance since the bull market
    has begun. Being bullish though doesn’t necessarily equate to higher prices next
    week as a consolidation period is often followed by new highs. Keeping it simple
    though the path of least resistance is higher and for the time being any pull-backs
    will probably be limited and bought back up.
