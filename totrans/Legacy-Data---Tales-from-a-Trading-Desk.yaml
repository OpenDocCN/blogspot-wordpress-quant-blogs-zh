    on InfoQ which discusses enterprise platform as a service.  Slide 23 onwards discusses
    legacy data, and the issues associated with data consumption.  Master Data Management
    is also discussed in the deck.  Which leads to a New York Times [article](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/technology/for-big-data-scientists-hurdle-to-insights-is-janitor-work.html),
    “For Big-Data Scientists, ‘Janitor Work’ Is Key Hurdle to Insights”.

    and preparing unruly digital data, before it can be explored for useful nuggets.
