    pain: Individuals can relive and reexperience social pain more easily and more
    intensely than physical pain. Studies 1 and 2 showed that people reported higher
    levels of pain after reliving a past socially painful event than after reliving
    a past physically painful event. Studies 3 and 4 found, in addition, that people
    performed worse on cognitively demanding tasks after they relived social rather
    than physical pain.'
