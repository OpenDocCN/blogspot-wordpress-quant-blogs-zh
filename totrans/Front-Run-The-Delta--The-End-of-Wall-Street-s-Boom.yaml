    heads of the other Wall Street firms—all said what an awful thing it was to go
    public and how could you do such a thing. But when the temptation arose, they
    all gave in to it.” He agreed that the main effect of turning a partnership into
    a corporation was to transfer the financial risk to the shareholders. “When things
    go wrong, it’s their problem,” he said—and obviously not theirs alone. When a
    Wall Street investment bank screwed up badly enough, its risks became the problem
    of the U.S. government. “It’s laissez-faire until you get in deep shit,” he said,
    with a half chuckle. He was out of the game."'
