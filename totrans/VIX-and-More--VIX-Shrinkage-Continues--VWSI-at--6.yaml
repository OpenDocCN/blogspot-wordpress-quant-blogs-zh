- en: During the week, I chronicled [The Incredible Shrinking VIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/12/incredible-shrinking-vix.html),
    which addressed the issue of volatility falling in a market that was going mostly
    sideways to down.  By the end of the week, the VIX was down 4.80 points or 20.6%
    from the previous week, to 18.47 – a level not seen since the beginning of November.

- en: The interesting part of the week is that the SPX had a modest gain of 16.51
    (1.1%), so that very little of the move in the VIX (perhaps 1.25 of those 4.80
    points) can be attributed to a rise in the SPX.  The rest?  Some of it certainly
    comes from a seasonal pattern of historically low volatility around the holidays
    (see the [CXO Advisory Group](http://www.cxoadvisory.com/) on [U.S. Stock Returns
    Around the Year-End Holidays](http://www.cxoadvisory.com/blog/internal/blog12-24-07/)),
    but a considerable account is still unaccounted for.  It looks like it may take
    the unfolding of events in 2008 to explain the shrinking VIX anomaly.

    of +6, suggesting that the VIX should be close to bottoming.  Ironically, the
    VIX is up this morning, and so are the markets…

    where it is frequently blended with chardonnay and sauvignon blanc, but also sold
    on its own. Last I checked, [Peter Lehmann Wines](http://www.peterlehmannwines.com/ProductOverview.aspx?p=17)
    produces four different semillons, with the <placename st="on"><placename st="on">Barossa</placename></placename>

    a little to the east, just this evening I had an excellent [2002 Alpha Domus semillon](http://www.wineoftheweek.com/archives/wine040222.html)
    from New Zealand, but the Kiwis have yet to show the same enthusiasm for semillon
    that they have for sauvignon blanc. Still, the Alpha Domus effort proves that
    the potential is there.

    semillon, but one to keep an eye on is [L'Ecole Nº 41](http://www.lecole.com/wines_semillon.php),
    from the <place st="on"><city st="on">Walla Walla</city>, <state st="on">Washington</state></place>
    area.  This is, by a considerable margin, my favorite non-French semillion tasted
    in the past 25 years, a mineraly stunner that may have you rethinking how often
    you should be drinking this varietal.
