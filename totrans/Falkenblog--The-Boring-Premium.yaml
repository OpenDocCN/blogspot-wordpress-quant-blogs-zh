    those dreams away, it becomes an asset that is neglected. They find diversified
    firms offers less skew, and diversiﬁcation discounts are signiﬁcantly greater
    when the diversiﬁed ﬁrm offers less skewness than typical focused ﬁrms in similar
    business segments. They suggest a substantial proportion of the excess returns
    received on discount ﬁrms relative to premium ﬁrms can be explained by differences
    in exposure to skewness.'

    stories and potential. Conditional upon playing in a risky game, such as equities,
    there''s not a return premium for risk, there''s a premium for boring.'
