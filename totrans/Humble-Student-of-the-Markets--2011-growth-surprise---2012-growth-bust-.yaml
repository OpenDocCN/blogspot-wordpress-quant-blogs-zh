    of the questions that has been nagging at me is whether the Fed might over-react
    to the recent bout of economic growth.

    their non-consensus out-of-the-box thinking. The most memorable, for me, was their
    call after the Tech Bust to watch China as a source of global growth when few
    forecasters were even thinking about the Middle Kingdom.

    for 100% deduction of capital spending in 2011 would pull capex forward from 2012
    and create the illusion of growth (sort of a cash for clunkers program on steroids).
    In addition, the corporate cash that would flow into capex in 2011 would reduce
    liquidity and end the stock market rally [emphasis added]:'

    from 100% first-year depreciation this year only, and then, with its end-year
    withdrawal, a very sharp downswing in 2012\. This *Review* posits the chance that
    2% of 2012 GDP could be brought forward into 2011 to gain the tax break, and that
    its bunching at end-year could ***boost GDP growth to 7% in 2011 Q4 from 2010
    Q4***. ***But the loss of that spending in 2012 would doubly reduce cap-ex next
    year, maybe causing recession.*** In addition, the build-up of accelerated cap-ex
    this summer could remove much of the cash flow surplus that businesses are currently
    pouring into financial markets, at the same time as the end of QE2 takes away
    the current $100 billion/ month of Fed inflows. This liquidity squeeze would end
    the stock market recovery.'

    the capex story. The ratio of Industrial stocks, the sector where most of the
    capital equipment companies are, are in a well-defined uptrend relative to the
    market.

- en: What nags at me is the Fed reaction. What if the Fed interprets this growth
    spurt as a self-sustaining recovery and ends ZIRP prematurely? The resulting tightening
    effects would start to bite in 2012 and coincide with the capital spending slowdown.

- en: If the capital markets look ahead 6-12 months, it would start to anticipate
    a growth slowdown starting about 3Q, which is also the timeframe for the end of
    QE2 and discussions about the end of ZIRP. I am already seeing [worrisome negative
    divergences](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2011/04/no-time-to-be-hero.html) in
    the market, which should concern the bulls. My inner trader believes that there
    is still some limited upside to stocks, which he wants to stick around for. One
    of the important "tells" would be to watch for a downturn in the relative performance
    of the Industrials to the market shown in the chart above. My inner investor,
    on the other hand, is preparing for the storm to come. Its magnitude is unknown
    because it is highly policy dependent.
