    of China''s health is how much "unofficial" money from tycoons and wealthy officials
    have fled. If corrupt officials were to take money out of China , than it would
    be an important sign of the metaphorical rats leaving a sinking ship.'

    ***fuelled by a stampede of nervous money fleeing the mainland***. A look behind
