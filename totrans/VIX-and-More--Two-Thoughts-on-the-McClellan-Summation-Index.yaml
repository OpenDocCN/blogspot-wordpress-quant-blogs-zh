    is one of hours and days, yet I do have a long-term portfolio that helps motivate
    me to periodically check out trends and themes that may take months or years to
    play out.

    trends is the [McClellan Summation Index](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/McClellan%20Summation%20Index),
    which I have talked about here on several occasions in the past.  Lately I have
    been looking at a weekly version of the chart that goes back to 1998 (the farthest
    StockCharts.com has to offer) and two things have been gnawing at me.

    that once my gut starts to go bearish – which it does not do very often, but has
    done lately – I wonder whether my chart reading starts to suffer from [confirmation
    bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias).)

    chart (represented by the blue line that conveniently ignores the data from late
    2006 through early 2007) may turn out to be significant, particularly if the relatively
    low peak of 421 earlier this month cannot be surpassed in the near future.

- en: The second concern I have is the amount of time that the [Williams %R](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Williams%20%25R)
    indicator has spent below the -20 line.  Looking back at the chart, the only other
    time I can see that the Williams %R failed to generate these high values for at
    least nine months or so was in the last nine months of the 1999-2000 bull market
    top.

    me.
