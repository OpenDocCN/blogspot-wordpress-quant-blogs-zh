- en: I have a post coming up to talk about the role of Chief Architect and what I
    do from day to day. Not giving away any secret sauce ... just to explain what
    the role entails, after I have received a bunch of emails asking me exactly what
    architects do on Wall Street.

    of a C# framework, and I needed to deliver a Java-based SDK to some clients. I
    will dive into this a bit more in a future blog post, but let me tell you that
    I have a new appreciation for C# 3.0 and Visual Studio.

    Equity-Linked Technology at Merrill (or what's left of it) has made good use of
    it, so I want to see what they see.
