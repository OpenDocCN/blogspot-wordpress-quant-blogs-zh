    and information between cities. Over millenia, humans have gone from trading physical
    goods with wagons and ships to trading symbolic contracts with undersea cables
    and specialized radio networks. Markets’ adoption of communications technology
    has undoubtedly benefited society. But has it gone too far? Could the benefits
    of further speed be outweighed by the costs? A lot of people think so. And high-speed
    networks aren’t cheap; a new cable between Tokyo and London may [cost](http://spectrum.ieee.org/telecom/internet/arctic-fibre-project-to-link-japan-and-uk)
    $850M. But while I’ve heard lots of complaints about the cost of improving network
    infrastructure, I haven’t seen any estimates of the benefit. I will attempt to
    provide one here.

    firms are continually investing in speed, but these expenditures don’t increase

    CME contracts have an annual volatility of [10%](http://www.cmegroup.com/tools-information/quikstrike/volatility-term-structure-metals.html).
    This makes it easy to calculate how much their prices typically move in the ~2.5ms
    that wireless networks save over fiber (one-way): ![\sigma_{\Delta} = 0.1 yr^{-\frac{1}{2}}
    \sqrt{2.5 ms \cdot \frac{1.6 \times 10^{-10} yr}{ms}} \approx 2 \times 10^{-6}](img/4f9432d59a57210bb43038c85866e605.png)
