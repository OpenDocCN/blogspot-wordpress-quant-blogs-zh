    is for the KBW Regional Banking Index (KRX) to hold long-term support despite
    Friday's market jitters over the stability of Deutsche Bank. While KRX has held
    support, it disappointed the bulls by refusing to rally off the bottom.  We interpret
    this to mean that market sentiment over the banking crisis has stabilized.
