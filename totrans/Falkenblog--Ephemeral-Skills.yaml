- en: I use to be able to do this in under a minute, and knew several tricks, but
    now, I plod through. As I initially learned how to do this by reading a book,
    my ability to solve this is not very impressive (figuring it out without help
    would be a real achievement). It's a pretty pointless skill, so I imagine most
    people who have ever learned how to do this, have forgotten.

    This is understandable, as living in the US, there is really no need to know French,
    it never really comes up, and without practice, you simply forget. I often think,
    it would be nice to learn German, or multiply 3 digit numbers in my head quickly,
    but then think, no, it would be pretty pointless given my current situation.

    things they know are merely difficult: diagramming sentences? how a bill becomes
    a law? Understanding "Peasant Blacksmithing in Indonesia: Surviving and Thriving
    against All Odds" (Obama''s mother''s dissertation)? Kids have a sense of what
    is tripe, what is merely pedagogically convenient, or PC, versus something that
    can actually be useful. I used to teach, and when I look at what I learned as
    a teacher, it was mainly to give better examples and exercises, ones that are
    not merely for the test. Anything can be rationalized as essential knowledge,
    because almost any fact is useful knowledge to someone, but it''s all context
    and reasonableness. Thus, kids know most of the their day is spent learning stuff
    that they know is about as useful as learning the Rubik''s cube, and dread it.'
