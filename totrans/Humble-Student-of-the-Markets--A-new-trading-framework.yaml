    the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    often, but the character of the stock market has made an abrupt turn recently,
    as evidenced by the performance disparity between the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ 100.

- en: The weekly chart of the S&P 500 shows that it survived a brief corrective scare,
    but the index went on to fresh highs. By contrast, the growth-heavy NASDAQ 100
    is acting like a sick puppy. NDX violated a rising trend line and last week's
    rally attempt was rejected at the 50 dma level.

    market of extreme winners and losers. Traders need to be aware of this shift and
    adjust their analytical framework accordingly.
