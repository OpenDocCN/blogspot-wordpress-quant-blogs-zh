    like an oxymoron, but he would always try to highlight its character with the
    example of changing the default choice for 401k investments so that people save
    more.

    Right, the other side isn't obvious. I mean, I disagree with 'market irrationality'
    man Robert Shiller on a lot of issues, but also 'market rationality' proponents
    like John Cochrane or Eugene Fama. I'm a strong critic of Financial Theory, but
    find most other critics of this theory to be 'more wrong', and probably have less
    in common with your average finance critic than with the ruling elite of modern
    financial theory.

    and he's doing the sliding. I disagree with everyone on something, agree with
    no one on everything, and often share similar conclusions with people for very
    different reasons, so the weighting of my disagreement would be vital in figuring
    out my opposite link. Who weights the issues of agreement/disagreement? If this
    incredibly naive, unworkable idea was sufficiently vetted to merit mention with
    NPR, I would love to know what his other ideas are.

    Debate is not over! Indeed, a lot of issues Susstein finds have no legitimate
    other side would now be on the table! I'm thinking everything from racial profiling
    to all the Politically Correct taboos, such as the assertion the Holocaust never
    happened, HIV does not cause AIDS, etc. He would be '

    because I imagine the poor chaps in the "Office of Website 'Opposite Link' Definitions"
    would be in way over their heads, and that would mean fewer regulators actually
    doing real harm implementing regulations they could enforce.
