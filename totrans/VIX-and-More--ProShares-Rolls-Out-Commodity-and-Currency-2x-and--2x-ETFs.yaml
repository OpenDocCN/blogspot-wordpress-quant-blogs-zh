    Direxion Triple ETFs Will Revolutionize Day Trading](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/11/prediction-direxion-triple-etfs-will.html).
    I was going to do a follow-up to show how volume has skyrocketed in these ETFs,
    but [Bespoke](http://bespokeinvest.typepad.com/) beat me to it in today’s [3x
    ETFs on Fire](http://bespokeinvest.typepad.com/bespoke/2008/11/3x-etfs-on-fire.html).
    Bespoke includes some excellent graphics that capture the extreme volatility in
    these ETFs as well as the snowballing volume trend.'

    to ETFs. I think the ETF trend is here to stay.
