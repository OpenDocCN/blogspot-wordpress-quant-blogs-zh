- en: Sometimes misunderstandings can lead to enormous adverse consequences. In 1941,
    Japan believed that war was inevitable with the United States. The Americans had
    slapped a trade embargo on Japan, and made it clear that Japanese occupation of
    China was unacceptable. The Japanese High Command saw that America was a big industrialized
    country with resources that it could not defeat in the long run. The only solution
    was a quick strike to destroy American combat capabilities. The logical solution
    was a sneak attack on Pearl Harbor as a way of crippling American naval power.
    The rest, as they say, is history.

  zh: 有时误解可能导致巨大的不利后果。在1941年，日本认为与美国的战争是不可避免的。美国对日本实施了贸易禁运，并明确表示无法接受日本占领中国。日本最高指挥部看到，美国是一个工业化的大国，拥有无法在长期内击败的资源。唯一的解决办法是对美国进行快速打击，以摧毁美国的战斗能力。合理的解决方案是对珍珠港进行偷袭，以此削弱美国的海军力量。正如他们所说，余下的事情就是历史了。
- en: Tokyo just had one fatal misinterpretation of the American position. Washington
    did not consider Manchuria, which was China's industrial heartland and the jewel
    of Japan's occupation of the Chinese mainland, to be part of China. Had Japan
    withdrawn its troops from the south and remained in Manchuria, American entry
    into the Second World War would have been delayed for several years. Under that
    scenario, Nazi Germany would not have been forced to fight a two front war. Britain
    and her Commonwealth Allies would have been too weak to land in Italy in 1943,
    and the D-Day landings would have been out of the question. There would have been
    no Manhattan Project, or it would have been delayed for several years. Hitler
    might have been able to develop the Bomb. History could have been dramatically
    changed,

  zh: 东京刚刚对美国立场做出了一次致命的误解。华盛顿并没有认为中国东北部是中国的领土，这部分是中国的工业心脏地带，也是日本占领中国本土的宝石。如果日本从南方撤军，而保持在满洲，美国进入第二次世界大战可能会推迟几年。在那样的情况下，纳粹德国不必在两个战线上与敌人作战。英国及其英联邦盟友在1943年登陆意大利将会过于虚弱，而D-Day的登陆将根本不可能发生。将不会有曼哈顿计划，或者它将被推迟几年。希特勒可能有机会发展出原子弹。历史可能会发生戏剧性的改变，

    to be talking past each other. The result could be a trade war with catastrophic
