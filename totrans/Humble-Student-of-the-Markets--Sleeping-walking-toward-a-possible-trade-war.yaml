    Japan believed that war was inevitable with the United States. The Americans had
    slapped a trade embargo on Japan, and made it clear that Japanese occupation of
    China was unacceptable. The Japanese High Command saw that America was a big industrialized
    country with resources that it could not defeat in the long run. The only solution
    was a quick strike to destroy American combat capabilities. The logical solution
    was a sneak attack on Pearl Harbor as a way of crippling American naval power.
    The rest, as they say, is history.

    did not consider Manchuria, which was China's industrial heartland and the jewel
    of Japan's occupation of the Chinese mainland, to be part of China. Had Japan
    withdrawn its troops from the south and remained in Manchuria, American entry
    into the Second World War would have been delayed for several years. Under that
    scenario, Nazi Germany would not have been forced to fight a two front war. Britain
    and her Commonwealth Allies would have been too weak to land in Italy in 1943,
    and the D-Day landings would have been out of the question. There would have been
    no Manhattan Project, or it would have been delayed for several years. Hitler
    might have been able to develop the Bomb. History could have been dramatically
    changed,

    to be talking past each other. The result could be a trade war with catastrophic
    results (see
