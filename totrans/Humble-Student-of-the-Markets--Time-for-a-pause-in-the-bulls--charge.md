**Mid-week market update**

: Don't get me wrong, I am still bullish, but the stock market rally appear a little extended in the short run and due for a brief period of consolidation. The SPX broke out from its inverse head and shoulders (IHS) pattern this week, cleared its 50 day moving average (dma), and filled in the gap from March 22\. The next upside objective is the IHS objective of 2790-2800, whic coincides with resistance defined by the highs set in late February and March.

In the short run, however, the market looks overbought and may be due for a pause.
