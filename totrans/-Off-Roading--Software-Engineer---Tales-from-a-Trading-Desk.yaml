- en: I’ve Twittered Shanley’s recent “Productivity Myth” [previous](https://medium.com/about-work/1cd9fbf8ca15),
    but its worth a further comment.  Specifically, the 3rd bullet point, which I
    think is in some cases more appropriately termed “off-roading” from the original
    plan/delivery/iteration/milestone.  Unfortunately, unless you have clue’d up team
    leaders, or project managers that come from a development background, a lot of
    off-roading is hard to spot.  Consider this in the same context as the never ending
    morning stand-up “refactoring” bad smell.
