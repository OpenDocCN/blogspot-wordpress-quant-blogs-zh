    on a relatively small asset base in the early 1990s to over $2 trillion in assets
    today. What really spawned the explosive growth were hedge funds’ positive returns
    which were uncorrelated to the equity market in the post-2000 Tech Bubble bear
    market.

    500 shows that hedge funds returns have become highly correlated to the S&P 500\.
    In the current equity market downturn, hedge fund returns has fallen with the
    S&P 500 but the level of correlation has decreased in the last few months.

- en: For most of their history, hedge fund managers have marketed themselves as absolute
    return vehicles, with low correlations to other asset classes. As returns came
    down, they clung to the low correlation idea but that line is wearing a little
    thin these days.

    that I had access to a fair roulette game, i.e. the house didn’t have an edge.
    Returns would be uncorrelated to virtually any asset class that you could think
    of. Would you fund me on a 2% and 20% fee structure?

    is to learn to listen more to clients and understand how sponsors put together
    portfolios. You represent a piece of a jigsaw puzzle to them and know what the
    benefits you offer.

- en: This William Mercer [study](http://www.asrs.state.az.us/web/pdf/financials/20080321_investment_industry_trends.pdf)
    for the State of Arizona is typical of the new thinking. Mercer suggests, among
    other things, that sponsor portfolios should be optimized to alpha exposure. Expected
    alpha, alpha volatility and alpha correlation all matter in how you pick managers.
    This is part of the move toward the “portable alpha” concept where a sponsor moves
    towards a liability driven investing framework. He builds a passive portfolio
    based on that benchmark and then overlays a “portable alpha” on top of the passive
    portfolio.

    accepted and widespread then fee compression pressures are likely to rise. Reading
    between the lines the terms of “expected alpha”, “alpha volatility” and especially
    “alpha correlation” sound suspiciously like the hedge fund factor betas concept
    that Bridgewater Associates and others have documented in their studies. The obvious
    conclusion is you shouldn’t be paying the same level of fees for beta as alpha.'

    can gain access to a portable alpha in two ways. The high cost route would be
    to buy it from a hedge fund or a hedge fund of funds. The cheaper way would be
    to synthetically create an alpha stream by hiring a traditional long-only manager
    and shorting the manager’s benchmark against the long portfolio. As an example,
    the sponsor could hire a small cap equity manager and then simultaneously short
    the Russell 2000 using derivatives. The hedge fund solution would cost 2% and
    20% or more. The synthetic alpha solution would run around 0.5% and 1.0% for a
    reasonably large sponsor.
