    means to an end: highlighting the good ideas, argument, and data. There''s no
    royal road to this end. I review a couple papers a year for second-tier journals,
    and often I get to read the other referees comments in the second round, and usually
    find the other reviewer to be an distracted person who meticulously checks some
    things (grammar, math, the data, the big picture), but then ignores other dimensions.
    This is only natural, because often the papers are complicated, and he (or she)
    is counting on the other reviewer. But, what if I didn''t check his empirical
    results with data I have unique access to (say, on corporate defaults)? Would
    anyone know? If you know what buttons to push, especially by anticipating the
    kinds of people who will referee your paper, you can game the system to a large
    degree.'
