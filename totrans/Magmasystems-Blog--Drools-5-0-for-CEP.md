# Magmasystems Blog: Drools 5.0 for CEP

> 来源：[http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2009/08/drools-50-for-cep.html#0001-01-01](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2009/08/drools-50-for-cep.html#0001-01-01)

The new 5.0 version of

[Drools](http://downloads.jboss.com/drools/docs/5.0.1.26597.FINAL/drools-introduction/html_single/index.html#d0e808)

seems to have CEP capabilities.

Has anyone here tried it out yet? Do you think that it can handle about 10,000 events per second? Has anyone pumped market data through it?

I am going to start reading up on Drools Fusion and see how it contrasts with the upcoming Microsoft Orinoco. Fusion is here right now. Orinoco .... well .... we'll see.
