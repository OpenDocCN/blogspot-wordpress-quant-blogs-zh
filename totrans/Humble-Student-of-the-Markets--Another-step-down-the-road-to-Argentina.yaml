    to make a significant headway on innovation. Standard macro drivers such as lower
    tax rates don’t seem to have a significant impact on innovation. In fact, there
    are [indications](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2010/feb/23/usa-useconomy-innovation-states)
    that higher innovation regions have higher tax rates.

    innovation. But, ***in the Internet era, innovations rapidly disseminate around
    the world. It's not clear if innovation benefits can be contained in any country
    anymore***. For example, even though the United States is more innovative than
    Europe, it hasn't outperformed by much. Its celebrated prosperity during the Greenspan
    era turned out to be an old-fashioned bubble, not a reflection of superior innovation.

    Even if you build a better mousetrap, the world will not beat a path to your door.
    To be successful, you need marketing, distribution channels, reliable manufacturing
    processes, etc. Your resulting wealth also depends on your relative bargaining
    power within the value chain. We have had this private running joke in our family.
    Where other parents may have wished for their child to discover the cure for cancer,
    ours was that our child would commercialize the cure for cancer.
