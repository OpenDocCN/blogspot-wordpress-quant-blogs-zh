- en: to introduce a new kind of tax on financial transactions. The tax would be specifically
    linked to how much systemic risk a transaction -- say a loan from one bank to
    another -- creates. It's easy to roll your eyes when you hear about transaction
    taxes, thinking A. it will never happen and B. it might not do much good even
    if it did. There are real reasons to believe that a transaction tax might damage
    market liquidity. But the thing I'm writing about here is VERY different.

    borrow and lend in a way that doesn't increase risk to the overall financial system
    (by piling up debt on particular institutions, for example) would end up paying
    no tax. The idea is to bring systemic risk into the pricing system so institutions
    have an incentive to avoid it. In so doing, you provide a mechanism for the entire
    financial network to reconfigure itself to have lower systemic risk.
