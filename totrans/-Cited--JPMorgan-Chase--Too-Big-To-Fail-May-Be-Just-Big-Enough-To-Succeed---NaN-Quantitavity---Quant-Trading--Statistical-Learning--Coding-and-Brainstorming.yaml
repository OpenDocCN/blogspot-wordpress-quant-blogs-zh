- en: '“JPM is #1 in Global Investment Banking fees. It is #1 in Fixed Income Markets
    income share. It is one of the biggest derivatives traders. One might at first
    think that the new rules for FinReg that are set to be implemented in 2013 would
    hurt JPM more than others. However, the opposite may be true. There are two derivatives
    laws that are particularly important.”'

  zh: “摩根大通在全球投资银行费用中排名第一，在固定收益市场收入份额中也位居首位，同时也是最大的衍生品交易商之一。起初，人们可能会认为2013年即将实施的新金融监管规则会对摩根大通造成比其他机构更大的伤害。然而，事实可能恰恰相反。有两项关于衍生品的法律尤为重要。”
- en: “The first law would require that most derivatives be traded on open electronic
    platforms, with prices visible to all participants before deals are done. This
    would over time lead to much lower prices for derivatives. It would mean lower
    prices (margins) for JPM in this area. However, the big traders say that large
    transactions if done openly would disrupt the markets. They are lobbying for exemptions.
    The big traders such as JPM will be the ones to get these exemptions. They are
    the ones that will get the higher prices for their large trade services.”

  zh: “第一项法律要求大多数衍生品必须在公开的电子平台上交易，且在交易完成前，价格对所有参与者透明。这将随着时间的推移导致衍生品价格大幅下降。这意味着摩根大通在这一领域的利润（价差）将减少。然而，大型交易商表示，如果大型交易公开进行，将会扰乱市场。他们正在游说寻求豁免。像摩根大通这样的大型交易商将是获得这些豁免的机构。他们将为其大宗交易服务获得更高的价格。”
- en: “Another area of weakness in the law is the following loophole. Traders are
    now required to post U.S. Treasuries as collateral for a bigger part of their
    trades. Many do not have these Treasuries handy. A new business has sprung up
    to service this. The big banks will lend the traders U.S. Treasuries or other
    qualified securities in exchange for lower rated securities (for a fee). This
    is being called collateral transformation. Experts say this is just a way of hiding
    risks this law was supposed to avert. In other words the law has created a lot
    of red tape, with little actual risk avoidance for this case (and many others).
    JPM should be able to benefit from providing this service.”

  zh: “法律中的另一个弱点是以下漏洞。现在，交易商被要求为其大部分交易提供美国国债作为抵押。许多交易商手头并没有这些国债。一种新的业务应运而生，以满足这一需求。大型银行将向交易商出借美国国债或其他合格证券，以换取低评级证券（收取费用）。这被称为抵押品转换。专家表示，这只是规避该法律本应避免的风险的一种方式。换句话说，该法律创造了大量繁文缛节，对于这种情况（以及许多其他情况）几乎没有实际的风险规避。摩根大通应该能够从提供这项服务中获益。”
