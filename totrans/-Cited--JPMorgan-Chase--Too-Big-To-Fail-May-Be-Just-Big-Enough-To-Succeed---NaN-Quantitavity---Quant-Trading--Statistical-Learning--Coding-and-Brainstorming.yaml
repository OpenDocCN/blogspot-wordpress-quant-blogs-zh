    income share. It is one of the biggest derivatives traders. One might at first
    think that the new rules for FinReg that are set to be implemented in 2013 would
    hurt JPM more than others. However, the opposite may be true. There are two derivatives
    laws that are particularly important.”'

    platforms, with prices visible to all participants before deals are done. This
    would over time lead to much lower prices for derivatives. It would mean lower
    prices (margins) for JPM in this area. However, the big traders say that large
    transactions if done openly would disrupt the markets. They are lobbying for exemptions.
    The big traders such as JPM will be the ones to get these exemptions. They are
    the ones that will get the higher prices for their large trade services.”

    now required to post U.S. Treasuries as collateral for a bigger part of their
    trades. Many do not have these Treasuries handy. A new business has sprung up
    to service this. The big banks will lend the traders U.S. Treasuries or other
    qualified securities in exchange for lower rated securities (for a fee). This
    is being called collateral transformation. Experts say this is just a way of hiding
    risks this law was supposed to avert. In other words the law has created a lot
    of red tape, with little actual risk avoidance for this case (and many others).
    JPM should be able to benefit from providing this service.”
