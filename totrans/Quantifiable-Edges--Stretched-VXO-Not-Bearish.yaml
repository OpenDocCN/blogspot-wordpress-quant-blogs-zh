- en: 'A common misconception among traders is that an extremely low VIX or VXO compared
    to its short-term moving average has bearish consequences. On Tuesday the VXO
    closed over 15% below its 10-day ma for the 2nd day in a row. Below is a test
    that shows results of shorting the SPX when the VXO is stretched below certain
    levels for at least 2 days in a row. It covers once there has been a reversion
    to the short-term mean:'

- en: The system as designed shows a slight edge when there is a mild VXO stretch.
    As the stretch gets larger the edge disappears. To understand why this occurs,
    consider what would cause the VXO to get extremely stretched, as opposed to slightly
    stretched. A mild stretch might be the result of a typical move higher in the
    market. An extreme stretch is more likely to be the results of a strong thrust
    higher in the market. If the market is truly strong, then the result will be more
    upside – not downside.

    in a downtrending market can offer short opportunities. A strong move higher,
    on the other hand, can lead to a vicious short-covering rally – not something
    you normally want to step in front of with short trades.

    I posted yesterday. The extremely low VXO is NOT suggestive of a selloff, though.
