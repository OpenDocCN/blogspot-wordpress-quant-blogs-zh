# VIX and More: Introducing the VIX and More Global Volatility Index

As representatives of the G20 assemble in Washington to discuss the state of the global economy, this seems like a good time to take the wraps off of the *VIX and More* [Global Volatility Index](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Global%20Volatility%20Index).

Without getting into all the details, the Global Volatility Index calculates a weighted average of the implied volatility in options for equities in the [15 largest global economies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28nominal%29), which represent approximately 76% of the world’s economic activity.

To the best of my knowledge, this index is the first of its kind, with previous volatility indices limited to country-specific volatility or in the case of the [VSTOXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VSTOXX), to the Eurozone area.

The chart below plots the Global Volatility Index against the [Dow Jones World Stock Index](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Dow%20Jones%20World%20Stock%20Index) over the course of the past year. The Global Volatility Index opens up many new areas of analysis and interpretation of the markets and I will talk more about these in this space in the coming weeks.
