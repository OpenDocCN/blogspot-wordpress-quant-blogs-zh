    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    a break. Even though the market was short-term oversold, rally attempts have been
    rather anemic. More worrisome is the behavior of the NASDAQ 100 (NDX), which had
    been the market leadership. The NDX convincingly breached a rising channel, and
    it is now testing its 50 day moving average (dma). While its relative uptrend
    against the S&P 500 remains intact, the relative performance of semiconductor
    stocks, which had also been a source of technology related market strength, also
    violated a rising trend line.

    stock-market timers that I monitor on a daily basis. (This is what’s measured
    by my Hulbert Stock Newsletter Sentiment Index, or HSNSI.) This average currently
    stands at 30.1%, which means that the average timer now has 70% of his equity
    trading portfolio out of the market.

    from the chart below, the HSNSI’s recent plunge rivals what happened during the
    February-March waterfall decline. That’s amazing, since the market’s early September
    sell-off — scary as it was — is child’s play by comparison. In contrast to a 34%
    plunge in the earlier downturn, the S&P 500 SPX, +0.05% from Sep. 2 to Sep. 8
    lost less than 7%.
