- en: The attached chart shows the [VXN](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXN)
    (volatility index for the NASDAQ-100 or [NDX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/NDX))
    over the past five years, with a 10 day simple moving average, flanked by dotted
    lines representing 20% above and below the 10 day SMA.

- en: Anybody who has been paying attention knows that the last several days have
    been highly unusual.  As the chart shows, the VXN, which rarely closes outside
    of those 20% bands, is currently ***38.2%*** above the 10 day SMA.  This is about
    as extreme as it gets for volatility outliers and suggests a high probability
    of a sharp reversion to the mean in the VXN, coincident with a bounce back in
    the NDX.

- en: For the record, the same market bottom signal is coming from the VIX and SPX,
    but without the extreme reading that is characterized by the VXN and NDX.  By
    contrast, the signal from the [RXV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/RVX)
    and RUT is substantially weaker and only marginally tradeable.

- en: Volatility signals with this level of confidence are extremely rare, so if you
    are looking for an excuse to get long in a big way for the short term, or to trade
    VIX along the lines recently [suggested by Brian Overby](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/11/brian-overby-on-trading-vix-options.html),
    today is an excellent opportunity to try to time the markets.
