    becoming a Halloween tradition. Last Halloween, I wrote about how China could
    control Taiwan without firing a shot (see [Scary Halloween story: How a weak USD
    could hand China a major victory](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2019/10/29/scary-halloween-story-how-a-weak-usd-could-hand-china-a-major-victory/)).
    This year, a new geopolitical tail-risk is materializing for investors and for
    global stability. China''s *People''s Daily* recently published a “Letter to Taiwan’s
    Intelligence Organs” warning Taiwanese intelligence agencies against supporting
    President Tsai Ing-wen’s resistance to China''s unification efforts (article in
    Chinese [here](http://paper.people.com.cn/rmrb/html/2020-10/15/nw.D110000renmrb_20201015_3-07.htm),

    from the “fatal track” of seeking Taiwan’s independence, which only leads to self-annihilation
    and is doomed to fail.

    firmly opposed those independence-seeking diehards of the blind to allay their
    tiger-riding behaviors, and advised them to get a clear understanding of the situation
    and get back to the correct track, the only correct way of stopping them from
    dead ends.

    the same blood and same culture, and the mainland always welcomes variety of cooperation
    through different channels and encourages exchanges and dialogues with people
    of insight in Taiwan.

    phrase, "Don't say I didn't warn you" (勿谓言之不预也). Similar language was used by
    China when it launched military offensives in the past. It used that phrasing
    when it issued a "surrender or die" ultimatum to the nationalist garrison in Beijing
    in 1949\. it warned American-led forces in Korea not to approach its Yalu River
    border in 1950; it warned India before attacking in 1962; and it issued a similar
    warning before the invasion of Vietnam in 1978.
