- en: Comments from various contacts in the consulting industry lead me to believe
    that there is a slowdown in financial IT consulting, with benches growing at various
    consulting companies around the globe. At the same time, there is a hiring freeze
    going on at many Wall Street companies, with exceptions being made only for outstanding
    candidates.

  zh: 来自咨询行业各种联系人的评论使我相信，金融IT咨询正在放缓，全球各地的咨询公司的候补名单正在增长。与此同时，许多华尔街公司正在进行招聘冻结，只有杰出候选人才能获得例外。
- en: A lot probably has to do with the subprime mess and the incredible losses that
    many Wall Street companies have announced. Bonus season is going to be very "challenging"
    this year.

  zh: 很大程度上这与次贷危机和许多华尔街公司宣布的惊人损失有关。今年的奖金季节将非常“具有挑战性”。
- en: My company will be making a concerted effort to recruit outstanding IT people
    from outside. We realize that new blood is the way to shake things up, and transform
    our shop into one of the major IT houses on Wall Street. The business side has
    been taken over by people who have CompSci degrees from top universities, and
    this new regime realizes that tech will drive future profitability.

  zh: 我的公司将努力从外部招募优秀的IT人才。我们意识到新血液是打破现状、将我们的公司转变为华尔街主要IT公司的方式。业务方面已经由来自顶尖大学的计算机科学学位持有者接管，这个新政权意识到技术将推动未来的盈利能力。
- en: Despite this, I have open headcount for 2008 for the Complex Event Processing
    initiative. When I get back from my week in France, I will post a general call
    for help. If you have a driving interest in CEP, and you can code in C#, Java,
    and C++, and you know how to deal with Linux and Windows, then I want to speak
    to you. I think that CEP will provide a fundamental change in the way we trade
    and the way that apps are written and the way that data is visualized.

  zh: 尽管如此，我仍为2008年的复杂事件处理计划留有职位。我从法国回来后，我将发布一个求助的一般号召。如果你对CEP有浓厚的兴趣，并且你会用C#、Java和C++编程，并且懂得如何处理Linux和Windows，那么我想要和你谈谈。我认为CEP将根本改变我们的交易方式、应用程序的编写方式以及数据的可视化方式。
