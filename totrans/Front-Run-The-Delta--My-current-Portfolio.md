# Front-Run The Delta: My current Portfolio

> 来源：[https://frontrunthedelta.blogspot.com/2007/10/my-current-portfolio.html#0001-01-01](https://frontrunthedelta.blogspot.com/2007/10/my-current-portfolio.html#0001-01-01)

In my equities portfolio, separate from my options holdings, as of this writing I own the following. Since reorganizing on 1 Sept 07, I have seen a 12.8% return with zero leverage.

Given the price of commodities, many of the holdings and their respective returns will be self-explanatory with about 30 seconds of research. Aside from the obvious, I believe, given the turbulence of the market and the uncertainty of the next few quarters, we will see a FtQ that will benefit international large-caps (ie MSFT and GE).

GE - General Electric

MSFT - Microsoft

NE -Noble Corp.

NOV - National Oil Well

OII - Oceaneering International

PCU - Southern Copper Corp.

RIG - Transocean Inc.

STO - Statoil ASA

Stocks that I am watching, and waiting, for the right time to enter are:

DO - Diamond Offshore Drilling

JEC - Jacobs Engineering Group

RDS.A - Royal Dutch Shell Cl A.

NUE - Nucor Corp.

ISRG - Intuitive Surgical

HSC - Harsco Corp.
