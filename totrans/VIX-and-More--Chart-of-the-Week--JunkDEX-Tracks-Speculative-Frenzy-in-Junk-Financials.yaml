- en: Back in September 2007, when I thought the markets were a little too frothy,
    I created a list of [Overripe High Fliers](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Overripe%20High%20Fliers).
    A few weeks later, in [From Overripe to Vulnerable?](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/10/from-overripe-to-vulnerable.html)
    I took the current list of 14 overripe high flier stocks that had been drawing
    a great deal of speculative attention into something I called the [OHFDEX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/OHFdex)
    – an index based on those overripe high fliers.

    that it spawned a number of follow-up posts, including, [OHFDEX One Year Later](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/10/ohfdex-one-year-later.html).

- en: In the spirit of the original OHFDEX, I have been watching closely the recent
    speculative frenzy in some stocks that have come to be known as “[junk financials](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/junk%20financials).”
    These are [financial firms](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/financials)
    that were the recipients of government bailout funds during the financial crisis
    and now sell at valuations substantially below 2007 levels. They include American
    International Group ([AIG](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/AIG)),
    Fannie Mae ([FNM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/FNM)), Freddie Mac
    ([FRE](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/FRE)), Citigroup ([C](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/C)),
    CIT Group ([CIT](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/CIT)) and Bank of
    America ([BAC](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/BAC)). In the last
    few weeks, these stocks have routinely accounted for 30% or more of the total
    volume on the NYSE and on Friday alone the group of six traded 2.53 *billion*
    shares.

    on the part of investors to be an important step in the healing process, the recent
    headlong rush into risk-seeking behavior has me more than a little concerned.
    How healthy can the markets be when speculation in six companies that were all
    but bankrupt a few months ago now accounts for one out of every three shares traded
    each day?

- en: In order to track the speculative interest in junk financials, I have created
    what I am calling the [JunkDEX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/JunkDEX),
    which consists of equally weighted positions (as of 1/2/09) in AIG, FNM, C, CIT
    and BAC (I elected to omit FRE due to the strong similarities with FNM.) I scaled
    the JunkDEX so that it had the same value as the SPX at the beginning of the year.
    As this week's chart of the week below shows, the JunkDEX led the S&P 500 index
    down from January through March, bottomed two days earlier and rallied impressively
    through the middle of May. From May through early August, the JunkDEX lagged the
    SPX significantly, before spiking dramatically during the past 3 ½ weeks.

    out to be the case, I expect it will signal an imminent top in the broader markets,
    just as the OHFDEX did.

- en: Going forward, I will keep an eye on speculative activity in the junk financials
    and in the JunkDEX for clues about the sustainability of the recent bull leg.
    I will update the performance of the JunkDEX, as appropriate and suggest that
    traders treat these stocks with extra caution, whether long or short.
