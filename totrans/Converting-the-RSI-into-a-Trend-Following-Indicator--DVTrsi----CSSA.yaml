- en: A little known fact is that the RSI14 can be converted into an effective trend
    following indicator using re-scaling. The concept is based on the observation
    that in bull markets, the RSI14 rarely if ever gets below 30 (oversold) and but
    it frequently exceeds 70 (overbought). The reverse is true with bear markets,
    where the RSI 14 is frequently below 30, often before a big plunge, yet it almost
    never gets above  70\. As a result, when the market diverges and spends a lot
    of time in overbought territory in bear markets, or in oversold territory in bull
    markets–a trend reversal is likely underway. My technique for accomplishing this
    re-scaling process is much different than say the PID Oscillator (see Technical
    Analysis of Stocks and Commodities Magazine). In this case I do not make any assumptions
    about what constitutes oversold or overbought in various markets. I focus on the
    core concept itself—persistent overbought conditions as identified mechanically
    using a lookback period should indicate the presence of a bull market or vice
    versa. The resulting indicator outperforms the vast majority of standard trend-following
    indicators on the S&P500.
