    diverse data set from a major financial services firm. Data includes credit ratings
    for the borrower at the time of loan origination. Inclusion of this important
    variable helps ensure unbiased estimation of the coefficients of other risk factors,
    such as current loan-to-value ratio and changes in local unemployment rates. We
    should also acknowledge data limitations: it only includes loans originated during
    1993-1997 time period when house prices in most (though not all) markets were
    stable or increasing'

    toe in the empirical pool. After all, 4 years, not including any cyclical volatility,
    that would be irrelevant for modeling a worst-case-scenario, and they realize
    this.

    data! They knew the data's limitations, but by the end ignored them. In other
    words, forget about the business cycle--we have a large number of observations!
    I see this a lot in default modeling, where someone will look at a bunch of daily
    data on bonds, and say they have 400,000 observations in the default model, ignoring
    the fact that the ten years of daily IBM data is not 2520 observations, more like
    3.

    because the correlation structure underlying the data may actually drastically
    reduce the degrees of freedom. Making sure your data has the appropriate sample
    is a big issue in all social science, as often someone will observe how college
    kids respond to stimuli to predict how people in general respond, assume men are
    the same as women. Their is no simple cure other than to be thoughtful about the
    specific application.
