    of European and American banks heating up, I want to make sure everyone had a
    chance to read Paul Krugman’s [Wall Street Voodoo](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/19/opinion/19krugman.html?_r=1&em)
    from Sunday’s New York Times. Krugman tackles the issue of so-called ‘[zombie
    banks](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/zombie%20bank)’ that can still
    operate while technically insolvent and whose market capitalization, says Krugman,
    “is entirely based on the hope that shareholders will be rescued by a government
    bailout.”'

    Maths and Dead Banks](http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2009/01/voodoo-maths-and-dead-banks.html).
    Hempton claims that banks whose liabilities currently exceed assets can earn their
    way back to solvency if the net interest margin is sufficient to generate enough
    operating income to overcome the gap between liabilities and assets, hopefully
    in the span of a few years.

  zh: 约翰·赫姆普顿在[Voodoo Maths and Dead Banks](http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2009/01/voodoo-maths-and-dead-banks.html)中提出了对僵尸银行偿付能力问题的挑战。赫姆普顿声称，当前负债超过资产的银行可以通过净利差足够产生足够的营业收入来弥补资产和负债之间的差距，希望能在几年内实现偿付能力。

    a homeowner who is underwater can continue to make mortgage payments until he
    or she crosses back into a positive equity situation in their home. The key for
    the banks is a healthy interest rate spread and a relatively brief recession that
    keeps loan losses from getting out of hand.

  zh: 僵尸银行可以通过与房屋贷款欠款的房主一样的方式实现偿付能力，直到他们再次进入房屋的正资产情况。银行的关键在于健康的利率差和相对较短的经济衰退，以避免贷款损失失控。
- en: The problem with propping up zombie banks is that it may be too attractive of
    an alternative politically to prompt proper consideration of other options. Further,
    zombie banks will always look more attractive than they should due to the penchant
    for overly optimistic estimates of the gap between liabilities and assets as well
    as hopes morphing into beliefs that the economic downturn will be shorter than
    what the next pundit says.

  zh: 支撑僵尸银行的问题在于，这可能是一个政治上过于吸引人的替代方案，以至于无法促使对其他选择进行适当考虑。此外，由于过分乐观估计负债和资产之间差距的倾向，以及希望变成相信经济低迷将比下一个权威说的更短的愿望，僵尸银行始终看起来比它们应该更有吸引力。
