    of European and American banks heating up, I want to make sure everyone had a
    chance to read Paul Krugman’s [Wall Street Voodoo](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/19/opinion/19krugman.html?_r=1&em)
    from Sunday’s New York Times. Krugman tackles the issue of so-called ‘[zombie
    banks](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/zombie%20bank)’ that can still
    operate while technically insolvent and whose market capitalization, says Krugman,
    “is entirely based on the hope that shareholders will be rescued by a government
    bailout.”'

    third alternative, which rewards bank shareholders at the expense of taxpayers
    and perpetuates the moral hazard problem.

    Maths and Dead Banks](http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2009/01/voodoo-maths-and-dead-banks.html).
    Hempton claims that banks whose liabilities currently exceed assets can earn their
    way back to solvency if the net interest margin is sufficient to generate enough
    operating income to overcome the gap between liabilities and assets, hopefully
    in the span of a few years.

    a homeowner who is underwater can continue to make mortgage payments until he
    or she crosses back into a positive equity situation in their home. The key for
    the banks is a healthy interest rate spread and a relatively brief recession that
    keeps loan losses from getting out of hand.

- en: The problem with propping up zombie banks is that it may be too attractive of
    an alternative politically to prompt proper consideration of other options. Further,
    zombie banks will always look more attractive than they should due to the penchant
    for overly optimistic estimates of the gap between liabilities and assets as well
    as hopes morphing into beliefs that the economic downturn will be shorter than
    what the next pundit says.
