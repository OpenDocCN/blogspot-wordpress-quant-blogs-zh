    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    signal. A bullish Trend Model signal that gets less bullish is a trading "sell"
    signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading
    "buy" signal. The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of
    the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. Past trading of
    the trading model has shown turnover rates of about 200% per month.

    which undoubtedly contributed to the slightly sour tone in stock prices. The combination
    of disappointments in ISM Manufacturing and Services, a so-so Beige Book report,
    and softness in the Labor Conditions Market Index all contributed to the downbeat
    macro-economic momentum.

    Index (ESI), which measures whether high frequency economic releases were beating
    or missing market expectations. As the chart below shows, ESI has been falling
    in the past few weeks on both sides of the Atlantic.

- en: A case could be made that the dip in ESI is just a blip. A check of bottom-up
    fundamental indicators and technical market breadth shows that both of these other
    dimensions of market health are signaling further stock market gains. For now,
    I am inclined is to give the bull case the benefit of the doubt.
