    (sometimes called gating).

- en: 'I''ve brought up the idea of conditioning systems based upon regimes many times
    in past posts. Some texts call this filtering, although I prefer to use the term
    conditional gating. The simple idea is to turn on a certain system during certain
    conditions and either: switching systems, or simply tracking the underlying series
    during alternate conditions. In this case the gating condition is regime, which
    in turn is, is High or Low Volatility as measured by the VIX.  Although I''m not
    divulging the details of the underlying system itself, I''ve seen enough discussions
    in public domain to feel that other traders have picked up on the ideas demonstrated
    here.'

- en: The animation below shows the system results during each step of the conditioning
    variable, the VIX. Notice the dramatic improvement at the value of 23\. Also,
    notice as mentioned in earlier posts how the optimal switching point of 23 is
    the most robust value, since even if the OOS results are to the left or right
    of the optimal switching point, they will be the best local values over a wide
    range of dependency. The astute observer might have noticed that this system is
    simply tracking buy&hold during low vix regimes, while switching on system V,
    during the high regimes. It is evident that the terminal wealth simply tracks
    buy & hold after a certain value of VIX, since it is always locked on to tracking
    mode under a certain threshold.

    OOS as well.
