    [learning about options](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/learning%20about%20options)
    from scratch and are looking for suggestions on how to proceed.

    trade options, it will probably be worth your while to take some time to understand
    how they work. At the very least, it is helpful to appreciate what is in the black
    box that generates various options indicators, such as the VIX and the [put to
    call](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/put%20to%20call) ratios.

    cover the subject of learning about options. Today I will talk about two excellent
    general resources on the web; in later posts I will examine educational resources
    offered by the exchanges and several options brokers, recommend some books, discuss
    additional web sites and conclude with an overview of some of my favorite options
    blogs.

    free resources on the web that allow someone who is interested in options to learn
    at their own pace and in small chunks of ideas and information.

- en: Two excellent all-purpose resources for options beginners are [The Options Guide](http://www.theoptionsguide.com/)
    and [The Options Industry Council (OIC)](http://www.888options.com/). I mention
    these two sites first, because their sole intent is to inform and educate, unlike
    some commercial sites that provide some free information and then try to sell
    you something with a subtle or sometimes not-too-subtle approach.

- en: The Options Guide has a variety of short articles in their [Options Basics](http://www.theoptionsguide.com/stock-option.aspx)
    section, as well as a handy [Options Strategies](http://www.theoptionsguide.com/option-trading-strategies.aspx)
    reference, where you can search for specific types of options strategies that
    meet your needs, or click on an excellent visual menu of profit and loss graphs
    to get detailed information about a wide variety of strategies. There are even
    separate sections for [index options](http://www.theoptionsguide.com/index-options.aspx)
    and [VIX options](http://www.theoptionsguide.com/vix-option.aspx).

    The Options Guide is a great starter kit and reference tool, I consider the OIC’s
    web site to be the gold standard. It is a great place to browse and get lost.
    If you want articles, DVDs, books, brochures, etc. on just about any options topic
    you are interested in, there is a good chance you will find it in the OIC’s online
    vault. The OIC has embraced a multimedia approach and as a result, offers online
    classes, as well as seminars and webcasts. You can see what material is available
    as a [video webcast](http://www.optioneducation.net/select/webcasts.asp) and also
    download a wide variety of [podcasts](http://www.optioneducation.net/select/podcasts.asp).

    an options [strategy screener](http://www.888options.com/resources/options-strategy-screener.jsp)
    and a [position simulator](http://www.888options.com/resources/options-positions-simulator.jsp).
    If that is not enough, you can even do some [virtual trading](http://www.optioneducation.net/select/vts_signup.asp)
    through the OIC.

- en: Considering that everything offered by The Options Guide and just about everything
    (books are an exception) offered by the Options Industry Council is free, investors
    who are interested in learning about options should put these two web sites at
    the top of their list when embarking on a self-study approach to learning about
    options.
