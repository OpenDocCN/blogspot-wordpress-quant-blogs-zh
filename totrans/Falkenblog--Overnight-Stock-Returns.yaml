- en: Below are the annual logarithmic average and standard deviation of returns to
    some common stocks, and two primary ETFs, SPY and QQQ (percent returns look similar).
    I used as much data as every stock had, where IBM goes back to 1962, but QQQ starts
    in 1999\. As you can see, the average returns for every stock except MSFT was
    significantly greater overnight than from open to close. In fact, on average,
    stocks had a negative return during trading hours, even though 2/3 of the 'risk'
    is intraday. This is yet another instance of how the theory that risk begets return
    is contradicted by reality.
