    exactly, these rumors will be confirmed by an official press release: [McKay Brothers](http://www.mckay-brothers.com),
    the well know international low-latency provider for high-frequency trading firms,
    receives investment from Dutch market-making firm International Marketmakers Combination,
    aka IMC. One of the McKay’s mottos, “*Not affiliated with any trading firm or
    exchange*”, will have to be removed.'

    trading community. Financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed.

    it seems that IMC purchased less than 30% of both McKay Brothers and their parent
    company Quincy Data. “*That’s great news for all of the trading firms that use
    our networks and for the industry as a whole*”, says McKay CEO Stéphane Tyč, while
    the Global Head of Technology at IMC, Arno de Quaasteniet, states that “*as a
    strong, independent supplier, McKay plays a crucial role in ensuring equal and
    fair market access to liquidity providers. These are principles IMC shares*”.

    is) a client of McKay Brothers. As far as I know  IMC is the only Amsterdam-based
    trading firm that did not build a proprietary microwave network (at least in Europe),
    unlike Optiver and Flow Traders, the two other Dutch HFT/market-making companies.
    Secondly, one may ask: why McKay Brothers needed investment from a HFT firm? And
    why IMC? It seems like various HFT firms offered to buy McKay Brothers but the
    company declined. On the other hand, we may assume that the firm needed investments
    to improve their networks (*i.e.* “*reducing latency to the physical limit*”).
    Even if it’s said that McKay has the fastest network between Chicago and New Jersey,
    speed race is an endless war.In June 2016, Stéphane Tyč explained in [Chicago](http://www.mckay-brothers.com/exchanges-vs-networks/)
    that route improvements are critical to save a few microseconds, as shown in the
    picture below – it took four years to achieve the “route improvement” in red:'

    between Chicago and Mahwah (the “route improvement”). That’s probably less than
    the €5,000,000 Jump Trading spent to purchase a tower in [Houtem](https://sniperinmahwah.wordpress.com/2014/09/25/hft-in-my-backyard-ii/)
    (Belgium), and less than what Vigilant and/or New Line Networks will spend in
    Richborough (if they can build these [controversial](https://sniperinmahwah.wordpress.com/2016/01/26/hft-in-the-banana-land/)
    very high towers). But everything is expensive and the cash flow of IMC will probably
    help McKay/Quincy. According to [Amterdamtrader](http://www.amsterdamtrader.com/2016/04/decent-profits-for-imc.html), the
    net profit of IMC was €185 million in 2015 (€20 million more than 2014). With
    all that money McKay will have the resources to acquire other towers – if needed.
    (If McKay builds a London-Stockholm route that would be amazing to have dishes
    put on old windmills.)

    will never give IMC a speed advantage. “*IMC will have no access to client information
    and no latency advantage”,* Stéphane says.

- en: So, one of the biggest market makers in the world (active in over 100 exchanges
    and employing 600 people) has stakes in one of the best low-latency networks provider
    in the world. It seems that the (young) HFT microwave industry is changing these
    days. For years you had private networks (built by proprietary firms like Vigilant/DRW,
    Jump, etc.) on one hand, and networks providers (McKay, Custom Connect, Perseus,
    etc.) on the other hands. In 2015, trading firms Jump Trading and KCG created
    a joint venture, New Line Networks, to “*sell network bandwidth to industry participants
    and third party vendors*”, meaning that they now compete with McKay and the other
    providers. Earlier this week Bloomberg [reported](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-29/traders-said-to-discuss-data-superhighway-from-chicago-to-japan)
    that at least three rival trading firms (Citadel, Jump and Virtu) “*are in talks
    to jointly build a Chicago-to-Japan communications link*”, including a microwave
    route between Chicago and the U.S. west coast – a project dubbed “Go West”. Competition
    in the very low-latency area is no longer a war between proprietary trading firms
    and networks providers – it’s a little bit more complex now. Anyway, good luck
    to the brothers. Accidentally I’ll be in Amsterdam tomorrow; I’ll meet several
    people involved in the HFT industry and I guess what we are going to talk.
