    growth and inflationary expectations. The chart below of commodities as measured
    by the CRB Index, shows that commodities have been rallying in the face a recent
    bout of equity weakness, which is constructive for the "buy risk" trade.

    I am closely watching the behavior of Banks against the market. The relative underperformance
    of the Banking Sector is a source of concern. As the chart below shows, the sector
    has broken down below a major relative support level and remains in a relative
    downtrend. While the sample size is low, past occurences have signaled major market
    dislocation, namely the Russia Crisis (1998) and the Subprime Crisis (2007), which
    didn't result in a market meltdown until a year later in 2008.

    be concerned about the tail risk of a European sovereign crisis or the possibility
    of a US default. Neverthless, commodity prices have been able to signal past financial
    meltdown episodes, i.e. the Lehman and Russia Crisis. Still, I expect to enter
    into this trade with tight stops as a way of defining my risk tolerance.
