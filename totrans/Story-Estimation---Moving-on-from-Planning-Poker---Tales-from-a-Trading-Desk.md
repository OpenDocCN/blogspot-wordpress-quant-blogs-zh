## Story Estimation – Moving on from Planning Poker

Planning Poker in some cases can feel like a death spiral – especially when the backlog is long.  Although old, its worth recalling the InfoQ [article](http://www.infoq.com/news/2010/10/estimation-techniques), “Are There Better Estimation Techniques for Experienced Teams?”.  Further, again old, but worth a read, Magic [Estimation,](http://campey.blogspot.com.au/2010/09/magic-estimation.html) and more recent, [Blink](http://dannorth.net/2013/08/08/blink-estimation/) Estimation.

Neil offers food for thought, “Contract Negotiation and the Old Banger”, specifically around software contracts, and agile [contracts](http://neilkillick.com/2013/02/08/noestimates-part-2-contract-negotiation-and-the-old-banger/).

> Do not fix time based on an estimate of cost because that inherently means you are agreeing to up-front scope detail that will likely bite you on the arse later and restrict the customer’s ability to request changes (and yours to welcome them) for their competitive advantage
