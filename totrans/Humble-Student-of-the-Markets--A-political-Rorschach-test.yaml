    researchers to solve the mystery of what was killing off honey bees. It turns
    out that the combination of a fungus and virus is proving fatal to the honey bee
    population.

    viewed through some very different political lenses, depending on where you sit
    in the increasingly polarized political spectrum. Deficit hawk could ask the question:
    "In an era of fiscal austerity, why is the government spending money on something
    as esoteric as bee research? If we wanted the government to stop wasting money,
    this is a perfect example of activity that government shouldn''t be in."'

    it's a special branch of the government, i.e. the Pentagon. For some conservatives,
    the military gets a special pass for their activities. Is bee research one of
    them?

    but also obligated to disobey a legal order***. In supporting this assertion,
    I discuss where the tipping point lies between the military officer’s customary
    obligation to obey and his moral obligation to dissent. This topic defies black-and-white
    specificity but is nevertheless fundamental to an understanding of the military
    professional’s role in the execution of policy. It involves complex issues—among
    them, the question of balance between strategy and policy, and between military
    leaders and their civilian masters.'

    a traditional role, e.g. bee research, echoes the reach of the Army in other emerging
    market countries of today, e.g. Asia where the Army can be found in industries
    such as banking and real estate.
