    upon broadly generalizing the previous post on [Quantile Stability](https://quantivity.wordpress.com/2009/08/03/stability-by-quantile/).

    estimation and decomposition. Low dimensional, linear time-series discontinuities
    can be detected using classic econometric structural change methods (Chow, Quandt,
    CUSUM, et al). Quantile regression may be effective for evaluating non-time continuity
    / stability of parametric linear models. Higher dimension, non-linear time-series
    discontinuity may be detected using [wavelet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelet)
    decomposition. All of these methods can be made pseudo-adaptive, at nearly any
    frequency, by using the corresponding iterative algorithmic form.

    analyzing covariance structure. A very wide variety of techniques are available
    in this domain, most commonly including: variance-derived tests (e.g. variance
    ratio to [ACF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocorrelation_function)), orthogonal
    / orthonormal decomposition techniques (e.g. [PCA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis)
    or [ICA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_component_analysis)), and [[G]ARCH

    or disturbances. Standard disturbance / residual models include such techniques
    as [state space models](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_space_(controls)) (generalization
    of linear filters, such as Kalman).
