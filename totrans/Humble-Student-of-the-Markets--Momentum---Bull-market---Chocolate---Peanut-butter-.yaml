- en: We examine the effectiveness of applying a trend following methodology to global
    asset allocation between equities,bonds,commodities and real estate.The application
    of trend following offers a substantial improvement in risk-adjusted performance
    compared to traditional buy-and-hold portfolios. We also find it to be a superior
    method of asset allocation than risk parity. Momentum and trend following have
    often been used interchangeably although the former is a relative concept and
    the latter absolute. By combining the two we find that one can achieve the higher
    return levels associated with momentum portfolios but with much reduced volatility
    and drawdowns due to trend following. We observe that a flexible asset allocation
    strategy that allocates capital to the best performing instruments irrespective
    of asset class enhances this further.
