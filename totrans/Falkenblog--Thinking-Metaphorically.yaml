    metaphors are a very powerful explanation of how humans think.'

    about understanding as seeing; morality is thought of as cleanliness, affection
    as warmth, winners are thought of as being in front of others. The abstract is
    explained via the concrete, something we know, such as seeing, feeling warmth,
    clean, catching, escaping.

    great way to explain a new idea. We have a small set of basic things our brains
    know, assumptions, and these are then the basis for building our more complex
    thoughts. I think this is important in understanding the problem of consciousness,
    in that we have certain thoughts are not inferred or reasoned, but rather hard
    wired. For example, we infer consciousness in others not via first-year philosophy
    courses, but rather mirror neurons that fire as if we were smiling, etc.

- en: Understanding the origin of our intuitions is helpful in understanding the concepts
    they relate to. Schnall talks about how we derive meaning fundamentally from analogies
    with our sense of our bodies. After all, the brain's main job is controlling its
    body, as over 50% of its neurons are within the cerebellum, the part of the brain
    that controls our motor activities. So, we all have a very deep, profound understanding
    of 'hard', 'up', and other sensations. Cognitive operations have arisen to solve
    certain adaptive challenges of the physical environment, and so embodied metaphors
    are the building blocks of perception, cognition, and action. People think metaphorically.
