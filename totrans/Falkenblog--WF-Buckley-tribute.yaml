    the amount of whiskey he had drunk during his lifetime and imagining it all in
    a single glass (about the size of a small movie theater) poised for him to start

    thought of the miles and miles of clichés that stand between him and that final
    baccalaureate address, twenty years hence, when he will say: essentially the same
    thing.'
