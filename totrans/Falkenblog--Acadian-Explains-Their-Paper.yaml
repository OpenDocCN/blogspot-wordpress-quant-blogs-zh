    volatility effect is from industry slants, such as utilities.  To the extent one
    can parcel out the low vol puzzle into a piece coming from the industry or country
    vs. firm volatility, one can see that this effect is about 60-40 for firm vs.
    industry.  So, it's not all an industry or country effect, which is interesting because
    some people are arguing that it is.  I never argued that, but Dimensional, GMO,
    and others have, and they are significant players, so it's good to try and settle
    that issue.

    the alphas have much higher significance than raw returns.  That's true, but hardly
    anyone has intuition for alphas from incorrectly specified models, so all the
    alphas made about as much sense as telling me how much my house is worth is Zambian
    kwachas. Statistical significance without intuition has always left me flat, but

    average annualized monthly returns (ie, monthly returns times 12) for the 1989-2010
    period, where data are presorted by industry betas.  The negative relation goes
    away looking at monthly returns.  That's interesting. But note, there's still
    a puzzle, because monthly returns should be increasing in beta and they clearly
    are not. It's not flatter than predicted, its flat.

    and so over the entire sample, the total returns are negatively correlated with
    the beta, why their figure 1 below has the top quartile betas with loser returns.
    Is the Security Market Line then, flat, or negative?

    lower returns given the total sample return was significantly lower, but their
    average monthly return was similar.  The trick is whether to think of the total
    sample return as an estimate, or the average monthly return, because if you do
    a monte carlo on the monthly returns, the expected

    return is lower via the variance drag on high voaltility portfolios. The trick
    is, with exponential compounding some histories will have really high returns
    that will make the average total return much higher than it's geometric return
    in sample; we haven't seen them, but they are possible. For example, if returns
    go up or down 50% with equal probability, then with two periods, the average compound
    return is -7%, but the average total return is zero (total returns of -75%, -25%,
    -25%, and +225%, average period returns of -50%, -13.4%, -13.4%, and +50%).  If
    all you saw was up 50% and down 50%, you might think the average return was -13.4%,
    but that's just one draw from history.

  zh: 返回的收益将与那些月度收益一样平均，即使预期的几何平均回报要低一些，因为高波动性投资组合的方差拖累了。 诀窍在于，通过指数复利，有些历史将会有非常高的回报，这将使平均总回报远高于样本中的几何平均回报；
    我们虽然没看到它们，但它们是可能存在的。 例如，如果收益以等概率上涨或下跌50%，那么在两个周期内，平均复利回报率是-7%，但平均总回报率是零（总回报率分别为-75%，-25%，-25%和+225%，期间平均回报率为-50%，-13.4%，-13.4%和+50%）。
    如果你看到的只是上涨50%和下跌50%，你可能会认为平均回报率为-13.4%，但这只是历史中的一次抽样。

    highly volatile stocks generating the really high returns that would be consistent
    with this explanation.  Then again, we only have 20 or so such countries, and
    maybe we need more.  It's a defensible position, I suppose, but if after 100 years
