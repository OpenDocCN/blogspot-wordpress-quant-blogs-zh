    stupid, so off-the chart stupid, that it mandates new charts of stupidity must
    be made. Thus, otherwise forgettable figures like David Chapman or traders like
    Nick Leeson have Wikipedia entries, while their betters are assigned to ignominy;
    they win! Perhaps that was Chris Cox's savvy strategy all along. He screwed up
    in various ways (short sale prohibitions), plus missing out on making good changes
    that seem, with hindsight to be sure, should have been made.

    'unregulated' credit default swaps, which are derivatives, are the basis for the
    fact that mortgages issued in 2006 had twice the loss rates as previous mortgages.
    If mortgages weren't worth 10 cents on the dollar, there would be no problem.
    The ABX.HE (subprime CDS) market highlighted that prior to any other indicator--way
    before the rating agencies. If anything, this diversified the risk, as opposed
    to aggrevated it.

    should not be the 'more' or 'less' debate, rather than the what (because the general
    debate is not soluble in finite time). Let's focus on what those might be, rather
    than giving blanket powers, especially to agencies that have demonstrated a lack
    of any efficacy in the past (SEC, OFHEO).

    Obama''s first task should be to fire all the senior people (eg, Cox) at all the

    fail: failure has consequences. They should know that if their companies screw
    up, they screw up. They can not blame the companies they regulate, they are responsible
