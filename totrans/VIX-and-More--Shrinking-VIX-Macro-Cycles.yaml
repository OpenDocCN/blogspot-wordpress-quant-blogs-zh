    it does from the trenches of daily trading. In the monthly chart below, one can
    see that from 1990 through 2008, the VIX moved in fairly regular ‘[VIX macro cycles](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20macro%20cycles)’
    of 2-4 years in duration, with relatively gentle trends and transition points.

- en: Seen in terms of monthly bars, the financial crisis of 2008 changed the nature
    of those VIX cycles, with the result that in the last three years the VIX cycles
    have been short and steep. Unlike the VIX movements through 2008, the more recent
    VIX movements seem to defy a traditional directional label, so for now at least
    I have attached a provisional label of “volatility chop” to characterize the VIX
    movements since the April 2010 low of VIX 15.23\. Note that this low coincides
    with the euro zone approval of $40 billion in bailout funds to [Greece](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Greece).
    In many respects, the volatility of the last 1 ½ years can be seen as a slow escalation
    of the [European sovereign debt crisis](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/European%20sovereign%20debt%20crisis)
    and the evolution of investor opinion regarding the magnitude of the risk and
    the ability of the euro zone to get ahead of the problem.

- en: Volatility has indeed been qualitatively different since the 2008 financial
    crisis. You can see the differences on a daily, weekly and monthly basis. Even
    more interesting for the academician and perhaps problematic for the trader is
    that distinguishing between volatility regimes is more difficult now that it was
    for the first decade and a half of the life of the VIX – at least from 30,000
    feet.
