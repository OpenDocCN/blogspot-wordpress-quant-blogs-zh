    on France from BNP Paribas, or protection on the UK from RBS, or protection on
    Germany from Deutsche Bank. If the CDS spreads on any of those banks started widening
    out significantly, it’s safe to bet that their lender-of-last-resort sovereigns
    will start widening too. This is something we’ve seen happen a lot over the last
    few years. Similarly, one can see banks widening with their sovereigns, as their
    backstops look increasingly vulnerable.

    reasons that the price of risky assets haven't totally fallen apart is because
    Mr. Market is discounting the possibility of policy intervention. Last week, the
    FOMC statement had a decided dovish tone. While they did not outright announce
    QE3, they did say that the outlook is decidedly weak. More importantly, the two
    more hawkish members of the FOMC fell into line and voted with the rest of the
    Committee. The only dissenter was a dove who wanted greater accommodation. In
    the post-meeting press conference, Bernanke did allow that the Fed would look
    at MBS purchases if the circumstances were right.

    debt purchases were intended to be "temporary" - which was very European of him.
