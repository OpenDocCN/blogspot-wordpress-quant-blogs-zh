- en: I have some good news and bad news. The good news is the option market isn't
    as concerned about the prospect of a contested election. The chart below shows
    the history of the term structure of at-the-money implied volatility (IV). The
    latest readings shows that IV spikes just after Election Day, and deflates slowly
    afterward. The bad news is it took a -1.9% decline in the S&P 500 to invert the
    term structure to create this condition.
