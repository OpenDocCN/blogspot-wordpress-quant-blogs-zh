- en: First there was [Inspectd.com](http://www.inspectd.com/), a nice little site
    to practice your technical analysis skills with what is essentially a chart trading
    simulation program, where you start with $100,000 and use charts, moving averages,
    and volume to make long or short bets on the stock charts that are presented at
    random. This is a fun site that is both educational and addictive.

    While Chartgame lacks the shorting option (even if you can "pre-borrow" the shares)
    of Inspected, it adds some all-important customizable indocators: RSI; MACD; and
    Bollinger. One other feature I like most at Chartgame is the ability to let time
    pass and optimize entries and exits rather be forced into the more limited buy/sell/skip
    now options that are available with the Inspected version of the game. This is
    a good way to sharpen discipline for entries and exits alike.'

    chart pattern recognition from these two sites. I recommend giving them a test
    drive.
