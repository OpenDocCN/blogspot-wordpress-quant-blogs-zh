- en: 'The S&P500 and the Nasdaq Composite are two very different indices; the S&P
    is an index of the 500 largest companies by market capitalization, while the Nasdaq
    Composite is an index of smaller and more growth oriented companies. The two share
    an interesting and complex relationship–which is a topic for another article. In
    examining that relationship, we can measure the correlation between the two indices
    to see if that yields valuable information. In theory a weakening correlation
    between the two indices would indicate a healthy market where the movement of
    stocks is somewhat independent of broad market factors. This weak correlation
    in turn drives down index level volatility, and increases daily persistence as
    stocks develop lagging relationships with their peers. This allows for different
    stocks to take turns leading the market—driving the index higher relentlessly. In
    this sense, a falling correlation regime (such as the one we are in right now)
    it is a “market of stocks” rather than a stock market and more alpha can be generated
    by trading individual stocks than at the market level. In contrast, a strong correlation
    would indicate the presence of fear–each company is treated as a source of cash
    in periods of mass liquidation, and they are all sold simultaneously with little
    discrimination between whether they are good or bad. This high correlation drives
    up market volatility, and the result is a low-return environment with excessive
    standard deviation. In this environment, alpha is best generated by trading “beta”
    by harvesting the surface mean-reversion of the index. Lets look at some evidence:'

    when 20-day correlations are either below the median, or falling, far superior
    to buy and hold returns over the same period.  In contrast the rising or above
    median correlations were not favorable, and underperformed buy and hold returns
    over the same time period. Now the next logical question is how this effect is
    moderated by the previous levels of correlation in the recent past. Presumably
    lower or falling correlations would be even more beneficial when the market correlation
    was higher in previous periods. A good example would be following a market correction,
    a fall in correlations brought about by increases in speculation and a decline
    in fear should signal strong gains. To test this, I looked at whether the 20-day
    correlation was above or below the median 30-days ago. Here are the results:'

- en: Consistent with predictions, returns are even stronger when correlation is falling
    from a higher base. What was interesting was that the most negative situation
    was when correlations were rising and coming off a higher base. This is in contrast
    to findings that high and rising volatility are actually positive in the short
    term as they tend to preclude bottoms. The answer is, as alluded to before in
    a previous post–correlations actually lead volatility–the increased relationship
    between previously unrelated stocks mathematically increases the  “capture rate”
    of the average of all stock volatilities. Observing the leading variable–correlations-
    allows you to see “cracks” in the market, and is thus a valuable timing tool.
