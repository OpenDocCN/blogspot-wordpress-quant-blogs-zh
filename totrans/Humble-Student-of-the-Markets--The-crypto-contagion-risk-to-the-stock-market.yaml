    problem, cryptocurrencies are mainly traded in the offshore market. A crypto trader
    can exchange USD for crypto, but banks do not allow direct access to crypto exchanges,
    with some exceptions. The crypto trader can exchange his USD for a stablecoin,
    which is a token that is theoretically backed 1 for 1 to the USD. He then exchanges
    his stablecoin to buy cryptocurrencies and back when he sells. When he wants USD
    in his account, he instructs the stablecoin provider to convert his stablecoin
    into USD, which is deposited to his onshore USD account.

    system. Stablecoins are supposed to be like money market funds, they shouldn't
    be trading below par. Last week, the TerraUSD stablecoin, also known as UST, broke
    its USD peg and sparked a crisis of confidence. Within the space of a few days,
    the value of LUNA had evaporated to zero. Crypto traders began a virtual bank
    run on stablecoins. Tether, the largest stablecoin, broke its peg last week, While
    prices have partly recovered and stabilized, Tether is still trading slightly
    below 1.
