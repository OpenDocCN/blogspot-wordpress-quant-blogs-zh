# Welcome! | All things finance and technology…

> 来源：[https://mhittesdorf.wordpress.com/2010/02/22/hello-world/#0001-01-01](https://mhittesdorf.wordpress.com/2010/02/22/hello-world/#0001-01-01)

I started this Blog to serve as an outlet for my thoughts, musings and rants related to all things finance and technology, though I may wander farther afield from time to time.  I will also share my ideas and future plans for Excelsior, my open source automated trading platform available on sourceforge.net at [http://sourceforge.net/projects/excelsiorauto/. ](http://sourceforge.net/projects/excelsiorauto/.) This is my first foray into the blogosphere so I’m hoping for the best!
