    that have generated a perfect storm.  The storm being production outages that
    are difficult to diagnose due to lack of understanding of the application stack,
    tools, and knowledge.

    though evidence – log files, monitoring tools, etc.  Your own codebase can often
    be improved with appropriate logging and inclusion of monitoring tools/UI’s.  Issues

    to understand the inner workings.  One example in Neo4j.  What follows is a few

- en: Neo4j browser (port 7474 by default) has a “:play sysinfo” which has some basic
    information that can prove useful e.g the Transaction tile, and in particular
    “Current”.  If Current remains move than 0 for a duration, when you expect it
    to be 0, you could have long running transactions 😦
