    financial one, that I am watching for. Already, the shares of Goldman Sachs appear
    to be in freefall (and on high volume).

    market. The chart below plots the relative performance of the BKX to the market
    going all the back to 1993\. Right now, the banks are now testing a critical relative
    support level. Instances in the past where it has broken these support levels
    have been signals of rising systemic risk in the financial system that ultimately
    culminated in market meltdowns. The first instance warned of the Russia Crisis,
    which brought down Long Term Capital Management. The second occurred in April
    2007, which was the subprime crisis - whose ultimate conclusion was the Great
    Recession of 2008.

    SPDR (XLF) for the past two-and-a-half years shows that the Financials may have
    already broken down on a relative basis. The sector is definitely in a relative
    downtrend. XLF may have already violated relative support, though arguably it
    is still in the process of testing a relative support zone.

    are a good place to hide. If the Timer Model were to signal a period of heightened
    financial stress, then the model portfolio would rotate into the safety of the
    US Treasury long bond (unless the crisis is a US default, in which case I would
    find something else, e.g. Canadas). On the other hand, if things turn around because
    of a policy response, e.g. QE3, then the Timer Model would move into the aggressive,
    high beta trade of emerging markets and commodity producers.'

  zh: ，结合诸如BKX或XLF与市场的关系等次要指标，是一个不错的藏身之处。如果定时器模型预示一段金融压力加剧的时期，那么模型投资组合将转向美国国债长期债券的安全性（除非危机是美国违约，那样我会找别的东西，比如加拿大的）。另一方面，如果因为政策反应，例如QE3，情况有所好转，那么定时器模型将转向积极的高贝塔新兴市场和商品生产商交易。
