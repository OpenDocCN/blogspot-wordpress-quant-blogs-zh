    introduced by [Woodshedder](http://ibankcoin.com/woodshedderblog/author/woodshedder/)
    in the [Simple, Long-Term Indicator Near to Giving Short Signal](http://ibankcoin.com/woodshedderblog/2011/08/28/simple-long-term-indicator-near-to-giving-short-signal/)
    post. This strategy was also analyzed in details by MarketSci in [Woodshedder’s
    Long-Term Indicator](http://marketsci.wordpress.com/2011/10/04/woodshedders-long-term-indicator/)
    post.

    curve shown by Woodshedder reveals a significant discrepancy. The ROC strategy’s
    equity curve peaked in 2008-2009, while the equity curve shown by Woodshedder
    peaked in 2011\. I re-created this strategy in Amibroker and got similar results
    to the ones reported by Woodshedder. So what is wrong?

- en: The difference arises because in period 1, prices have dropped 10% and hence
    we have $10 additional dollars to invest. So if the proceeds are reinvested, the
    portfolio value in period 0 is $100, in period 1 is $110 = 1.1 * $100, in period
    2 is $121 = 1.1 * $110, and the total return is $121 / $100 – 1 = 21%.

- en: Conclusion, if Backtesting with Short positions we cannot use weights * return
    to compute portfolio return because it assumes that all mark-to-market gains are
    reinvested right away, instead we should use shares to create the backtest.
