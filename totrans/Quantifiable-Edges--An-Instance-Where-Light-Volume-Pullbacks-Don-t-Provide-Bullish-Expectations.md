# Quantifiable Edges: An Instance Where Light Volume Pullbacks Don't Provide Bullish Expectations

the expectations can turn bearish. For instance, the S&P dropped about 1.5% today on the lightest volume since July 3rd. I loosened the parameters slightly to get a decent sized sample and ran a study:

Of course volume this week and next week are expected to be a bit lighter due to traders taking vacations. Still, I don’t find the results terribly encouraging for the bullish case over the next two weeks.
