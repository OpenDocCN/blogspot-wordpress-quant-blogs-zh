# VIX and More: Stock of the Week Winning Streak Hits 13 Weeks

At the end of May, in [VIX and More Stock of the Week Selection Up 343% in 14 Months](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/05/stock-of-week-selection-up-373-in-14.html), I promised to post future [Stock of the Week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/stock%20of%20the%20week) (SOTW) selections here on the blog one day after I flagged them in the [subscriber newsletter](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/subscriber%20newsletter) as long as the string of consecutive winning weeks remained intact. With the 3.5% gain in last week’s selection, Tech Data ([TECD](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TECD)), the weekly winning streak is now up to 13 weeks.

This week’s SOTW, geothermal and water source heat pump manufacturer LSB Industries ([LXU](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/LXU)), lost 0.02 today and dropped the cumulative return since the 3/30/08 inception down to 371%.

Should LXU manage to rally and post a gain for the week, I will carry this feature forward until the SOTW winning streak is broken.

Until then, I am partial to riding the hot hand and seeing where it takes me.
