    other than to make new highs. Both the DJIA and the SPX made fresh all-time highs
    today. While that may appear to be bullish, there are plenty of warning signs
    beneath the surface that this advance may not be entirely sustainable.'

    a negative 5-day RSI divergence, indicating flagging momentum even as the index
    made new highs. In addition, the VIX Index fell below its lower Bollinger Band,
    indicating an extremely overbought condition.
