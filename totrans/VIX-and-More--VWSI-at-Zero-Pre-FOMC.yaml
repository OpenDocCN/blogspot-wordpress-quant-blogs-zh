    sideways action in advance of the [Fed](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/03/fed-links.html)
    decision, the [futures are suggesting](http://www.clevelandfed.org/research/Policy/fedfunds/index.cfm)
    that a 0.25% rate cut is in the works.

- en: The VWSI is not tipping its hand vis-à-vis volatility expectations, moving back
    to zero after registering a fairly extreme -6 last week.  The -6 VWSI reading
    preceded a week in which the VIX fell 3.40 points (14.8%), bringing the volatility
    index back down to the levels of most of the short and medium-term moving averages.

- en: Recall from previous *VIX and More* [research](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/01/vix-price-movement-around-fomc-meetings.html)
    that the VIX has a tendency to anticipate higher volatility than the post-FOMC
    frenzy actually delivers, drop on the day of the announcement and perhaps one
    additional day, then take two weeks or so to attain pre-FOMC levels.  In the absence
    of any compelling reason to expect something different this time around, keep
    an eye on the typical scenario to see if it plays out once again.
