    (VelocityShares Daily 2x VIX Short-Term ETN) story was behind us, you might want
    to think again.

    that FINRA is “looking at the events and trading” associated with TVIX and more
    generally that the regulator has “a review under way looking at a host of issues
    relating to ETNs and other complex products.”

    to its [Intraday Indicative Value](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/intraday%20indicative%20value)
    (a real-time estimate of an ETP’s fair value, based on the most recent prices
    of its underlying securities) during the last three days.

    Suisse ([CS](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/CS)) [suspending creation
    units](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2012/02/credit-suisse-suspends-creation-units.html)
    on February 21, TVIX typically traded at a premium of about 0.5% above its indicative
    value. After the creation units were suspended, the premium vacillated wildly
    (as seen in the graphic below), though for several weeks the premium was locked
    in a relatively narrow range of 10-20%. That premium over indicative value spiked
    to 89% on the day before the announcement that Credit Suisse was resuming creation
    units. Once that resumption of creation units was announced, the premium in TVIX
    fell all the way back to 2% in just three days, no doubt signaling to many that
    it would soon be business as usual in TVIX trading.

    in the 10-15% range, ending today at 11.4%.

- en: The knee-jerk conclusion here is that there Credit Suisse may be considering
    the possibility of suspending the TVIX creation units once again. Another interpretation
    is that while Credit Suisse indicated they would reopen issuance of TVIX “on a
    limited basis,” it is now likely that the limited flow of TVIX creations units
    has not been sufficient to establish a price equivalence between TVIX and TVIX.IV,
    suggesting that an imbalance of supply and demand is persisting. Given the low
    trading volumes for the last three days, I am inclined to believe the that imbalance
    is more of an issue of supply constrains than one of excess demand, but here the
    simple interpretation of the data may not be the proper explanation.

- en: The fluctuations in the TVIX premium will be very interesting to watch going
    forward. One could argue that in spite of my many posts on TVIX, including a (pre-suspension)
    [reminder](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2012/02/will-tvix-go-to-zero.html) that
    the pricing supplement to the prospectus states in no uncertain terms, “The long
    term expected value of your ETNs is zero,” many investors had no idea what they
    were buying when they purchased shares of TVIX. In the six weeks since creation
    units were suspended, the public has had a reasonably thorough if sometimes painful
    education on the matter, even if some of this has come too late to avoid large
    losses.

    spike in TVIX premium? I have my doubts, but will certainly be watching in earnest.
    Remember that anyone who pays a 11% premium over fair value for TVIX should anticipate
    that the premium will evaporate sometime in the near future and that any short-terms
    gains will likely have to come in the form of other investors who are willing
    to pay an even larger premium to own an ETN that is likely to underperform [UVXY](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TVIX)
    if the VIX does spike.

    had this product been launched prior to the 2008 financial crisis, I have little
    doubt that many investors would have been genuflecting in front of it during the
    terror that gripped the stock market during its transition to a post-Lehman world.
