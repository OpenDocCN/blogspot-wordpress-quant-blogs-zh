    space during the rally from October to April and the pullback earlier in the month,
    I have yet to see any sort of detailed explanation of what happened during these
    two periods.

- en: This week’s [chart of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week)below
    attempts to bridge this gap, with a four-chart comparison of the bull move from
    October 4, 2011 to April 2, 2012 as well as the bear pullback from April 2 to
    April 10, 2012\. The top two charts cover the bull move, with the left chart capturing
    absolute sector performance and the right chart capturing sector performance relative
    to the changes in the S&P 500 index as a whole. The bottom two charts also have
    absolute sector performance on the left and relative sector performance on the
    right, but this time during the April 2-10 pullback.

    during the bear move. The relative data allow for a more nuanced analysis that
    shows financials ([XLF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLF)) were
    the main engine behind the bull move and also the largest contributor to the pullback.
    While financials shared some of the credit with consumer discretionary stocks
    ([XLY](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLY)), industrials ([XLI](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLI))
    and technology ([XLK](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLK)) on the
    way up, it was materials ([XLB](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLB)),
    energy ([XLE](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLE)) and industrials
    that helped to pull the broader index down. Only two sectors have outperformed
    the S&P 500 index on the way up and on the way down: technology and consumer discretionary
    stocks. Conversely, energy has been the only laggard in both directions.'

    bottom, consumer discretionary, materials and industrials have been the biggest
    contributors to bullish moves. Interestingly, technology has now flipped to being
    the biggest drag on performance.

    a run at 1500 ([take a bow, James Altucher](http://www.marketwatch.com/video/asset/7-reasons-the-sp-500-should-hit-1500/415ADC1B-4D66-461F-9F20-CA597CE4165C))
    will in large part be a function of the degree to which technology returns to
    a leadership role.
