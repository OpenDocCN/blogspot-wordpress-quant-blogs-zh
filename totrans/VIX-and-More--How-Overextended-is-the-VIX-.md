# VIX and More: How Overextended is the VIX?

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/06/how-overstretched-is-vix.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/06/how-overstretched-is-vix.html#0001-01-01)

In a word: excessively.

With the VIX currently up almost 14% to 16.96 in what is now a [four day bounce](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/06/vix-and-bollinger-bands.html), today's VWSI threshold numbers, which are good for generating setups for mean reversion plays are:
VWSI -8 at VIX 17.03
VWSI -9 at VIX 17.09
VWSI -10 at VIX 17.76

Keep in mind that most four day VIX moves will reverse dramatically over the course of the next few days. In fact, this may be a good time to review some [post-spike VIX tendencies](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/02/how-to-think-about-day-after-executive_27.html) I spelled out following the February 27 VIX spike.
