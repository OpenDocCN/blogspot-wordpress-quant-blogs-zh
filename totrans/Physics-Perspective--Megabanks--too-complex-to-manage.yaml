    by him. On this blog I've touched on the matter of financial complexity many times,
    but mostly in the context of the network of linked institutions. I've never considered
    the possibility that the biggest financial institutions are themselves now too
    complex to be managed in any effective way. In

    St.) makes a convincing case that the largest banks are now invested in so many
    diverse products of such immense complexity that they cannot possibly manage their
    risks:'

    Morgan revealed a $6 billion loss from a convoluted investment in credit derivatives.
    The *post mortem* revealed that few, including the actual trader, understood the
    assets or the trade. [It was even found that an error in a spreadsheet was partly
    responsible](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-01/occ-said-to-admit-it-missed-jpmorgan-var-change-in-senate-probe.html).

    products unleashed by deregulation. The assets at US commercial banks have increased
    five times to $13 trillion, with the bulk clustered at a few major institutions.
    JP Morgan, the largest, has $2.5 trillion in assets.

    question is are they “too big to succeed?” Can anyone honestly risk manage $2
    trillion in complex investments?

    money: They take deposits from the public, which they lend out longer term to
    companies and individuals, capturing the spread between the two.'

    The assets are assigned a possible loss, with the total kept well beneath the
    capital of the bank. This form of banking dominated for most of the last century,
    until the recent move towards deregulation.

    between the banks’ desire to buy a larger array of assets and the government’s
    desire to ensure banks’ solvency.

    in an explosion of financial products. It also resulted in mergers. My old firm,
    Salomon Brothers, was bought by Smith Barney, which was bought by Citibank.

    they borrow to trade credit swaps with other banks and hedge funds, to buy real
    estate in Argentina, super senior synthetic CDOs, mezzanine tranches of bonds
    backed by the revenues of pop singers, and yes, investments in Mexico pesos. Everything
    and anything you can imagine.

    can no longer be defined by one or two simple numbers. They often require whole
    spreadsheets. Mathematically they are vectors or matrices rather than scalars.

    to the total size of their assets. The business model scaled up linearly. There
    were even cost savings associated with a larger business.

    asset can itself change the nature of the asset. JP Morgan’s $6 billion loss was
    partly due to this effect. Once they had began to dismantle the trade the markets
    moved against them. Put another way, other traders knew JP Morgan were in pain
    and proceeded to ‘shove it in their faces’.

    about by computer programs. Many risk managers will privately tell you that knowing
    what they own is as much a problem as knowing the risk of what is owned.

    get larger, the ability to risk-manage the assets grows much smaller and more
    uncertain, ultimately endangering the viability of the business.
