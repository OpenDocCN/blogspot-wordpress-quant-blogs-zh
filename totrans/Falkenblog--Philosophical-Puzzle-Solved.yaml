    other people are conscious? You don''t think about it until you take ''Intro to
    Philosophy'', and then you realize you don''t really have a good reason. You can
    imagine a robot passing the Turing test and being ''non conscious'' (e.g., Searle''s'

    seems simple for humans (like recognizing faces) is difficult for computers, and
    what is difficult for humans (like playing chess) is easy for computers. Imagine
    that you are at a café with a friend. He reaches out toward a cup on the table
    between you and picks it up. What he is doing, and why, is obvious: He is drinking
    his coffee. But how does your brain figure all of this out in a split-second,
    without any need of conscious reasoning?'

    not through some abstract reasoning process that analyzes the visual information
    coming from her face and makes a logical inference that her expression is associated
    with happiness. Instead, you instantly activate parts of your brain that are active
    when you are happy. You may even make subtle, unconscious muscle movements to
    imitate her expression.

    language acquisition and autism, in that they argue there is something in these
    mirror neurons that is different in autistic people. Thus, even though there is
    no logical reason we must assume consciousness in others, it is a built in feature.

    than AI--it's an assumption! I wonder how many other puzzles can be solved in
    the same way, that is, we wonder why people believe X, and the answer is, because
    it's hard wired.
