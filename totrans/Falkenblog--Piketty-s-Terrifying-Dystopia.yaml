    good old days of *Les Trente Glorieuses* to reduce inequality. The point of the
    tax is not so much to increase revenues but rather to “expose wealth to democratic
    scrutiny" (p. 471) and thus "regulate capitalism” (p.518). As with all really
    popular nonfiction, it hits the zeitgeist because many think democracy and equality
    are paramount unalloyed objectives, so a big book scientifically proving these
    noble objectives are under a vicious assault is highly welcome; nothing rallies

    a 0.02% annual return. Given his assumed 5% return on capital, and that given
    Bettencourt's true returns have been above this average, this implies that it
    is clearly possible for reported income to stray from actual income by a factor

    terrifying” (p. 571). At one point he notes "15% of income was transferred from
    the poorest 90% to the top 10%" (p. 297) as if the rich simply took it from the
    middle class, and so the success of the rich just implies more theft, more injustice.
    Further, “immense inequalities of wealth have little to do with the entrepreneurial
    spirit and are of no use in promoting growth. Nor are they of any 'common utility,'"
    meaning, they do not contribute to growth, nor count in his social welfare function,
    Mussolini's "everything within the state, nothing outside the state." In sum,
    his main concern is that the rich don't create wealth, they mainly just take it
    from others, and so social justice is negatively related to their wealth. Stalin's

    the strategy must be a coordinated, region-wide if not world-wide effort. A strategy

    He thought people want recognition from society for one’s labors, as vocations
    are often chosen and mastered as part of a person’s own search for meaning. Being
    appreciated by others doing something you were not forced to do, something not
    everyone can do, gives great satisfaction. When you have to work at something
    that takes only effort you feel unimportant; your agency is not appreciated by
    others and when you die you'll be soon forgotten. Hegel noted that in agriculture
    people are mainly busy addressing immediate material needs.  Thus, duty was a
    strong Protestant ethic because working hard to feed your family was necessary
    and psychologically onerous, so many found comfort in the thought their hard work
    was part of God's plan. Given the prerequisites needed for the industrial and
    scientific revolution, perhaps it was.

    become independent and have freedom. Homer's Achilles chose to die with eternal
    honor rather than to live forever in unimportant obscurity, and it resonates because
    it exaggerates a choice many of us would make, as impacting others positively
    is in many ways more important than our own life. The defeat of natural necessity
    is a prerequisite for the development of the free individual and of ethical life
    for Hegel. Thus, in spite of the higher mortality rates of cities, people have
    always migrated to urban areas in their own search for meaning, the chance of
    life more than mere subsistence was enough to motivate many. People want higher
    status via their own individual essence. Having children, for example, is probably
    the most common way people do this, and it should be noted that if people today
    were simply maximizing their wealth they wouldn't have kids; they clearly want
    to connect to the future, not just consume.

    at all times, a world where I would need a lot of vodka and rum. Liberty, decentralized
    autonomy, and individual responsibility are considered pretexts for selfishness
    or bigotry, whereas libertarians see these ideas as pillars of a free and prosperous
    society; I'm sure this debate won't be solved in my lifetime.

- en: coming out this fall. He's a billionaire, one of those whose very existence
    presents a problem to be solved for egalitarians. Thiel's book bristles with the
    enthusiasm of an entrepreneur, with tips on how to maximize your chances for success.
    At only 200 pages, it's a book meant to be read, not referenced. It's like positive
    psychology, focusing on habits of happy, prosperous people so one can become one.
    If you have a child graduating college, and he wants to be an intellectual, buy
    him Piketty's book; if he just wants to be a success in some vague unknowable
    way, buy him Thiel's.
