    about it, the more I have come around to the idea that the* [*Best Post of the
    Year on Exchange-Traded Products*](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2012/05/best-post-of-year-on-exchange-traded.html)
    *may be the best post I have ever seen on the subject]* I thought it might be
    a good idea to include some functionality with that required weekend reading.

    a Volatility Target Backtest tool. What this tool is designed to do is to demonstrate
    what historical returns would have looked like if one had taken a high volatility
    ETP such as a leveraged ETP, a [VIX-based ETP](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20ETN),
    etc. and combined with a dynamic cash allocation and historical volatility data
    to limit exposure to a target volatility ceiling.

    on the Russell 2000 index of small capitalization stocks and want to get some
    long exposure to these stocks with the +2x leveraged ETP, ProShares Ultra Russell2000
    ([UWM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/UWM)). Last August, however,
    the 10-day historical volatility in UWM spiked over 160 and right now it is at
    41 – and you decide those levels of volatility are unacceptable, particularly
    with all the uncertainty in [Greece](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Greece)
    and across the euro zone.

- en: The solution? How about a portfolio that dynamically allocates between UWM and
    cash, (here using the iShares Barclays 1-3 Year Treasury Bond, [SHY](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SHY)),
    based on 10-day historical volatility data and targets a forward volatility level
    of 20%.

    using a monthly rebalancing period and starting in January 2007, when UWM was
    launched.

    in the future (and leveraged ETPs certainly entail a great deal of compounding
    decay risk for long-term investors), but the graphic is compelling, for both bull
    and bear markets. Think of this type of approach as a way to fine-tune risky products
    to a desired volatility level.
