# Subject | Tales from a Trading Desk

## Subject

Managed to get some coding done on the flight down to Sydney a few days ago.  The PoC I’ve been kicking around for some time got enhanced in the form of a specialised [Subject<T, R>](https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava/blob/master/rxjava-core/src/main/java/rx/subjects/Subject.java).  [ReplaySubject](https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava/blob/master/rxjava-core/src/main/java/rx/subjects/ReplaySubject.java) wasn’t quite working for me out-the-box.  I basically need a ReplaySubject with a twist 😉  Still amazed how many Java developers are still unaware of [RX](https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava).
