- en: Lately I have been a little light on posting due to various commitments that
    have kept me fully occupied. While I intend to start ramping up my posting frequency
    to previous levels, this seems like a good opportunity to highlight two relatively
    new bloggers who are serving up some excellent insights into volatility.

- en: On the scene since last July is [SurlyTrader](http://www.surlytrader.com/),
    whose bio indicates a specialty in trading derivatives. This blog should probably
    be listed in my *Favorite Options Blogs* blogroll, but because of the breadth
    of the subject matter covered, I have elected to included the not-so-surly-one
    in my list of *Other Blogs I Frequent*. If today’s [What Influences Volatiilty?](http://www.surlytrader.com/what-influences-volatility/)
    does not make you an immediate fan, I’d be shocked.

- en: A more recent entrant to the options blog scene is [Volatility Square](http://volatilitysquare.blogspot.com/).
    Launched earlier this month, the new blog on the block immediately won me over
    with topics that are close to my heart, such as the recent [VIX Fair Value Model](http://volatilitysquare.blogspot.com/2010/02/vix-fair-value-model.html).

    these two stick around for a long time.
