    The interesting thing about Spark is that its bias to in-memory.  IBM developerWorks
    has an article on Spark data analytics, “[Spark, an alternative for fast data
    analytics](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/os-spark/)“, which provides
    some insight into Spark.  Of interest is that Spark is implemented in Scala. 
    Amazon provides support for Spark, Shark and Mesos – see details [here](http://aws.amazon.com/articles/4926593393724923).

    services has tired leveraging Spark for possible risk management…
