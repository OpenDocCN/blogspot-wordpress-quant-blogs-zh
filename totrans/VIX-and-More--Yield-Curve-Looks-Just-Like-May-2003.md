# VIX and More: Yield Curve Looks Just Like May 2003

![](img/aa73ff1e97c8a1a463e61043b495b3b4.png)There are several places on the web where you can watch a short time-lapse video that shows the recent history of the yield curve.  One of those places is Fidelity’s [Historical Yield Curve](http://fixedincome.fidelity.com/fi/FIHistoricalYield) page.

In reviewing the history of the yield curve on the Fidelity site, I was surprised to see that the current yield curve is almost identical to the yield curve as it stood on May 2003.  This may just be a historical coincidence, but May 2003 also represents the beginning of the five year bull market that followed the 2002-2003 bottom.  In the graphic below, I have added a blue arrow to mark May 2003, which just happens to be the time that the SPX started making higher highs and confirming that a bullish move was underway.

Recall that the inverted yield curve which began in 2006 and caused considerable consternation among investors, turned out to be an excellent – if somewhat early – predictor of the coming stock market top and subsequent economic malaise.  Historically a steep yield curve, such as the one we have at present and saw in May 2003, has generally been a harbinger of better times ahead and is often found at the beginning of economic expansions.
