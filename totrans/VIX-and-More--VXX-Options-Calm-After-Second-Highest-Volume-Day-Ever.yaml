- en: Options volume in [VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX) (iPath
    S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN) surged to their second highest level ever
    on Friday, with 344,777 contracts trading and put volume (56%) outpacing call
    volume (44%) by an unusually high margin.

- en: The chart below shows the options activity in VXX going back to the beginning
    of August 2011\. Note that record options volume in VXX dates from August 5^(th)
    and occurred just before VXX spiked from 30 to the upper 50s. On that day and
    most of the other high volume days in VXX options the calls (green vertical bars
    on bottom portion of chart) saw more action than the puts (red bars), as investors
    were most likely betting on an increase in volatility – or hedging against that
    potential scenario.

    volume dominated. On balance, traders generally buy and sell more VXX calls than
    puts. In today’s session, so far the volumes in VXX options are much lower than
    they were on Friday and the activity in puts and calls is balanced and relatively
    calm.

    should not be considered contrarian sentiment indicators. Instead, I am merely
    suggesting that there was no panic in Friday’s VIX spike.

- en: In fact, the rumor I heard (via a commenter on the blog) that makes the most
    sense is that someone who had a position consisting of [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures),
    SPX [straddles](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/straddle) and the
    [TVIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TVIX) ETP (and supposedly about
    90% of the open interest in TVIX) had their position liquidated by a clearing
    house – and some of the banks that got wind of what was going on were able to
    front run that move. Take it all with a grain of salt, but that kind of scenario
    is a good fit for the prints I saw and the facts as we know them.

    open. February [VIX options](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20options)
    are last traded tomorrow, while the February VIX futures are last traded in Wednesday’s
    pre-market session, from 8:00 – 9:15 a.m. ET.
