- en: Options volume in [VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX) (iPath
    S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN) surged to their second highest level ever
    on Friday, with 344,777 contracts trading and put volume (56%) outpacing call
    volume (44%) by an unusually high margin.

- en: The chart below shows the options activity in VXX going back to the beginning
    of August 2011\. Note that record options volume in VXX dates from August 5^(th)
    and occurred just before VXX spiked from 30 to the upper 50s. On that day and
    most of the other high volume days in VXX options the calls (green vertical bars
    on bottom portion of chart) saw more action than the puts (red bars), as investors
    were most likely betting on an increase in volatility – or hedging against that
    potential scenario.

  zh: 下图显示了自2011年8月初以来VXX期权的交易活动情况。请注意，VXX的记录期权交易量始于8月5日，正好在VXX从30上涨到50多之前发生。在那一天以及VXX期权的其他高交易量日，看涨期权（图表底部的绿色垂直条）的交易活动比看跌期权（红色条）多，因为投资者很可能在押注波动性增加，或对这种可能的情况进行套期保值。
- en: Friday’s volume was unusual, just as it was on January 26^(th), in that put
    volume dominated. On balance, traders generally buy and sell more VXX calls than
    puts. In today’s session, so far the volumes in VXX options are much lower than
    they were on Friday and the activity in puts and calls is balanced and relatively
    calm.

  zh: 周五的交易量是不寻常的，就像1月26日一样，看跌期权的交易量占主导地位。总的来说，交易者通常会买入和卖出更多的VXX看涨期权而不是看跌期权。在今天的交易中，到目前为止，VXX期权的交易量远低于周五，看涨期权和看跌期权的活动相对平稳。
- en: This is not to say that VXX options investors are particularly prescient and
    should not be considered contrarian sentiment indicators. Instead, I am merely
    suggesting that there was no panic in Friday’s VIX spike.

  zh: 这并不是说VXX期权投资者特别精明，不应被视为反向情绪指标。相反，我只是建议周五的VIX暴涨没有引发恐慌。
- en: In fact, the rumor I heard (via a commenter on the blog) that makes the most
    sense is that someone who had a position consisting of [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures),
    SPX [straddles](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/straddle) and the
    [TVIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TVIX) ETP (and supposedly about
    90% of the open interest in TVIX) had their position liquidated by a clearing
    house – and some of the banks that got wind of what was going on were able to
    front run that move. Take it all with a grain of salt, but that kind of scenario
    is a good fit for the prints I saw and the facts as we know them.

  zh: 实际上，我听说的谣言（通过博客评论者）最有道理的是，有人持有[VIX期货](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures)，SPX[straddles](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/straddle)以及[TVIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TVIX)ETP（据说TVIX开放利益的90%）的头寸被一个结算所清算了，一些得知此事的银行能够提前预知此举动。对此要保持怀疑态度，但这种情况很符合我所看到的情况和我们所知的事实。
- en: Finally, keep in mind that the February VIX futures and options expire at Wednesday’s
    open. February [VIX options](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20options)
    are last traded tomorrow, while the February VIX futures are last traded in Wednesday’s
    pre-market session, from 8:00 – 9:15 a.m. ET.
