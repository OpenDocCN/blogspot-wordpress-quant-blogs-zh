    traders are fooled by the random success of their strategies. With that caveat
    in mind, we must consider the implications of the success of funds affiliated
    with Taleb that presumably were long a lot of out-of-the-money options.

    'called the crash', Taleb advises putting money where his mouth is.

    because one year is a data point, not data. Alas, his old fund, Empirica Kurtosis,
    also had a 50%-ish return its first year, then he called it a 'hedge' not a fund
    (trader-speak for a bad trade seen in the 'bigger picture'), and eventually packed
    it up. As I have argued

    while it might have worked great this year, on average the return to this strategy
    is very close to zero because the volatility smile makes one pay up for these
    kind of risks. Indeed, given the current level of volatilities (VIX at 70%), I
    think the best thing Taleb and his investors could do is say ''woo-hoo!'' and
    close up shop, because the price of disaster insurance is now so high that it
    is precisely the wrong time to be in this trade. In general, as opposed to the
    market underappreciating small risks, I think too many investors pay too much
    for them. Thus, the opposite strategy, as promulgated by Victor Niederhoffer,
    of selling wings is better over the long run, though I would do neither (alas,
    Niederhoffer''s fund was shut down last year, luckily).'

    insights. I agree with him wholeheartedly that, say, Phillipe Jorion would be
    a very dangerous choice for any Chief Risk Manager position, as his seminal book
    on Value-at-Risk displays an insufficient appreciation for estimation errors,
    an over-appreciation on the value of parametric models, how this information aggregates,
    or is useful in actually estimating risk capital. Jorion is an academic, and shares
    their ignorance of various practicalities. But Taleb takes this good criticism,
    and extends it so strongly I find myself more on Jorion's side than his, because
    of the immoderate application of an argument, the straw-man caricatures of those
    who practice risk management apply to no one (eg, VaR is worse than useless, the
    normal distribution is an 'intellectual fraud').

    What I find especially interesting is how someone can make such sweeping generalizations
    and have such an enthusiastic following among those he criticizes. Clearly, a
    lot of frustrated risk managers enjoy seeing their betters brought down a notch,
    but I think such stupid criticisms (and ''all risk management is wrong'' is a
    stupid criticism) are unhelpful, either for navigating the corporate hierarchy
    or correcting models that aided and abetted our current crisis. You may think
    you are smarter than your boss, and you may be, but he is probably not a moron.
    Indeed, he probably has some skills you lack, such as tact, or building coalitions
    in a complex set of people with different skills and goals. To the extent people
    error, one should always aim for a better diagnosis than more criticizing the
    fact that people believe in things that are often innacurate (see:'

    to call all sorts of people 'idiots', I am an envious player-hater with a specific
    DSM listing for daring to criticize the man, and his adherents remind me a lot
    of Ayn Rand acolytes in college (the Taleban, always true believers). But really,
    if he thinks all these people are idiots, after your little chat, do you really
    think he respects your opinion? I don't hate him, though I disliked it considerably
    when he would send emails to my old boss making bizarre allegations, and think
    his usage of 'moron/idiot/imbecile' and sweeping stereotypes reflects an unattractive
    temperament. Now that I don't have a timorous boss I find him merely amusing as
    he clearly has not acquired any sense of proportion or discrimination in his vast
    criticisms. As he discusses issues directly in my wheelhouse, I feel obligated
    to discuss where he is profoundly incorrect to the extent he is not inconsistent--which
    is rare, to be sure.

    by Taleb is to criticize from the sidelines those who attempt to model reality
    at all, while buying out-of-the-money options. In spite of returns to this strategy
    this year, it is not helpful for one's career as a quant, nor as an investment
    strategy.
