- en: The S&P 500 fell as much -4% from its all-time high in Evergrande panic pullback
    last week. Is the recent weakness just typical seasonal weakness or something
    more serious? The intermediate-term breadth looks disconcerting. The percentage
    of S&P 500 stocks above their 200-day moving average (dma) had been at the 90%
    level which indicates a "good overbought" sustained advance. This indicator has
    retreated below the 75% level. There have been four similar episodes in the last
    20 years. Three of the four occasions resolved themselves with substantial drawdowns
    while the remaining one saw the market trade sideways in a choppy way.
