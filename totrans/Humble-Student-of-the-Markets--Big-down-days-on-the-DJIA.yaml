    from January 1950 and they defined "a big down day as a decline of at least four
    standard deviations of the daily returns over the preceding four years (1,008
    trading days)." They found 45 observations and concluded that:'

    is above and below its 200-day SMA.

    small sample upon which to reliably draw conclusions. So I repeated the study
    using data for the Dow Jones Industrials Average, pulled from Yahoo Finance. That
    data goes back to October 1, 1928 - though if you average four years'' worth of
    data, you missed the Crash of 1929\. Here are the results:'

    of 45). The next day return averaged 0.36%, which beat the average daily Dow daily
    return of 0.03% by 0.33%. There was an outlier of -22.6% during the Crash of 1987
    which pulled down the average return. If we were to look at the median return,
    which is less sensitve to outliers, the median daily return on big down days was
    0.43%, which was substantially ahead of the Dow daily return of 0.04%. 62.7% of
    the subsequent daily returns were up, ahead of the 52.2% figure for all Dow days
    from 1928\. Next day returns were highly volatile and the standard deviation of
    daily returns after big down days was nearly four times the standard deviation
    of daily Dow returns for the entire sample.

    because of overlapping instances of big down days. The table reflects the first
    instance of a big down day in a five day period and subsequent big down day weekly
    returns were ignored.

    one-week return was not so encouraging. In all cases, the average and median returns,
    as well as percentage of positive weeks, underperformed our control sample of
    the Dow returns for our entire study period.
