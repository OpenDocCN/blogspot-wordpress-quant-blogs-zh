  zh: 期权到期周
- en: This week is the only week where the VIX has traditionally made a significant
    move down, probably a case of reality falling short of the expectations that some
    associate with -- and plan for -- on triple and quadruple witching expiration
    weeks. On average, options expiration week has the VIX falling 2.7%, compared
    with an average rise of 1.4% on non-expiration weeks. The VIX is significantly
    more likely to fall 15% or more on this week than on any other week. Correspondingly,
    this is the week in which the VIX is least likely -- at least in terms of historical
    data -- to spike to the upside.

  zh: 这一周是唯一一周VIX传统上会有明显下跌的情况，这可能是现实没有达到一些人对三重和四重巫婆到期周所期望的预期情况的案例。平均而言，期权到期周VIX下跌2.7%，而非到期周的平均上涨为1.4%。VIX在这一周下跌15%或更多的可能性明显高于其他任何一周。因此，就历史数据而言，这是VIX最不可能大幅上涨的一周。

- en: As many times as I have seen things heat up the week before options expiration,
    it came as a surprise to me to see that the week before options expiration consistently
    displays lower VIX volatility than the week of expiration or the week following
    expiration. Consistent with the idea that high volatility may be just around the
    corner during options expiration week, the VIX is least likely to spike to the
    downside during the week before options expiration – by a large margin. The VIX
    will spike to the upside more often than other weeks, but the combined upside
    and downside volatility of the VIX on the week before expiration is the lowest
    of the three weeks I examined. The average gain on the VIX of 1.4% during this
    week is the highest of the three weeks, but is not meaningfully higher than the
    0.2% of the other weeks, particularly if one backs out the historically poor performance
    during options expiration week.

  zh: 尽管我已经看到许多次在期权到期周之前市场会升温，但让我感到惊讶的是，在期权到期周之前的那一周显示出的VIX波动性竟然一直比到期周或到期后的那一周要低。与在期权到期周高波动性可能即将到来的观点一致，VIX在期权到期周之前最不可能大幅下跌，这种情况非常明显。VIX在这一周的上涨比其他周更为频繁，但相比我研究过的三周中的其他周，到期前一周的上涨和下跌波动幅度最低。在这一周，VIX的平均增幅为1.4%，这是我研究的三周中最高的，但如果排除历史上期权到期周的表现较差，特别是在这一周，这个增幅与其他周的0.2%相比并没有实质性的差别。

  zh: 期权到期后的一周
- en: One surprising finding was that the VIX is more likely to spike up or down in
    the week following expiration than any other week. The probability of an upside
    spike of 15% or more in the VIX was significantly higher in this week than any
    other week. The pattern held true for downside spikes as well, with the VIX significantly
    more volatile to the downside than the week before options expiration and slightly
    more likely to spike down than during options expiration week. In terms of relative
    performance, the upside and downside spikes seem to cancel each other out as the
    VIX is up an average of 0.8% during this week and 0.4% in the other weeks.

  zh: 一个令人惊讶的发现是，在期权到期后的一周，VIX更有可能大幅上涨或下跌。与其他任何一周相比，这一周VIX上涨15%或更多的可能性显著更高。相对于到期前一周，这一模式在下跌方面也成立，VIX的波动性明显高于期权到期周，并且稍微比期权到期周更有可能大幅下跌。就相对表现而言，上涨和下跌波动似乎互相抵消，因为VIX在这一周上涨平均为0.8%，而在其他周为0.4%。

- en: For those who are not familiar with the quirky personality of the VIX, this
    might be a good time to keep in mind that just looking from weekly close to weekly
    close, you can expect a price change of at least 10% -- either up or down – in
    30% of all weeks and a move of 20% or more on 7% of all weeks. On average, VIX
    moves down have been much more frequent during the past two decades than moves
    to the upside, with moves of 20% or more from week to week occurring at a rate
    of four times more frequently to the downside than to the upside.

  zh: 对于那些不熟悉 VIX 古怪个性的人来说，现在可能是一个要记住的好时机，仅从每周收盘到每周收盘看，你可以预期至少有 30% 的周会有至少 10% 的价格变动
    -- 无论是上涨还是下跌 -- 并且在所有周中有 7% 的周会有 20% 或更高的变动。平均而言，过去两十年来，VIX 下跌的情况比上涨频繁得多，每周从周初到周末的
    20% 或更大幅度的变动发生率低于下行变动的四倍。

- en: With the fifth consecutive week of dropping prices and a 10.15 close last Friday,
    I am mildly bullish on the VIX right now and would look to aggressively buy VIX
    calls should the VIX slip to the 9.75 mark.

  zh: 随着连续第五个星期价格下跌，并且上周五收盘为 10.15，我对 VIX 稍微持多头看法，如果 VIX 下滑到 9.75 的水平，我会积极购买 VIX 期权。
