    the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    rising channel and it is now testing support at the 50-day moving average (dma).
    The VIX Index spiked above its upper Bollinger Band which signals an oversold
