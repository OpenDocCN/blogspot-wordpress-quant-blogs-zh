# Quantifiable Edges: A 1% Gap Down from a 20-day Low

> 来源：[http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2011/11/1-gap-down-from-20-day-low.html#0001-01-01](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2011/11/1-gap-down-from-20-day-low.html#0001-01-01)

The SPY finished at a 20-day low on Friday, and now it is gapping down large this morning. I ran a test to see what kind of intraday edge this might suggest.

The raw numbers appears to suggest a mild intraday upside edge. But take a look at the profit curve.

This curve does not get me excited about buying into this gap down. Instead I will need to see more compelling evidence in order to anticipate an intraday move higher.
