- en: Nesta has just released a video (below) of the event I did in London a few weeks
    ago with Nate Silver and others. It's a short discussion (5 minutes from each)
    on prediction and forecasting, followed by 45 minutes of (good) questions from
    the audience. My wife's opinion is that I spoke well but radiated unnecessary
    waves of negativity over the audience by emphasizing the limitations of prediction
    and the dangers that follow from believing you can predict when in fact you cannot.
    Maybe so! But sometimes I do like to be cautious...
