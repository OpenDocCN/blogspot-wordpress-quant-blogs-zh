# Security: iframe sandbox | Tales from a Trading Desk

## Security: iframe sandbox

Its unfortunately that most software engineers believe security is a taboo word.  In reality, software engineers need to think of security as one of the key skills in their applications building toolbox – right next to preferred software pattern x, and preferred MVC/MVVM framework y.  I’d be curious therefore to know how many people building external accessible web sites have thought about the usage of iframe [sandbox](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/security/sandboxed-iframes/), or read [Privilege Separation in HTML5 Applications](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~devdatta/LeastPrivileges.pdf)?
