    of years ago and listened to some discussion of the general equilibrium models
    used by central banks in their efforts to understand and manage entire economies.
    According to economist Thomas Lux, she astutely commented on the peculiarity that
    these models do not even include a financial sector, even though the financial
    industry has expanded markedly over past decades and clearly now plays an enormous
    role in any developed economy.

    present at the meeting. Lux's comments are listed in his response to an email
    sent out to various scientists by Dirk Helbing, seeking their views on the primary
    shortcomings of contemporary economic theory.

    able to include instabilities, going beyond the representative agent approximation,
    and so on. And, as the Queen rightly noted, acknowledging that the financial sector
    exists.
