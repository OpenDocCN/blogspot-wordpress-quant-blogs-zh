    Switching the TV between the Yankee game and the MSG network showing old WWWF
    highlights from Madison Square Garden (yes, I used to be a major WWWF fan when
    I was a kid). Perfect TV for unwinding.

- en: It's strange being on the other side of the full-time/employee equation. Being
    part of the Equities Architecture team, you have various vendors trying to get
    a piece of your ear. There is no better PR than having your product as piece of
    a major equities trading system. As such, I am wondering why Microsoft never devoted
    major effort to attacking the trading system space. Microsoft would be a major
    force if they came out with the infrastructure to do low-latency, high-volume
    market data distribution, pub/sub messaging, ultra-fast UI grids, the ability
    to take an Excel model and compile it into a DLL, etc. Microsoft always seems
    to be on the cusp on doing something in the trading system space, but has never
    come through with a compelling, end-to-end story. However, new technologies like
    Windows Compute Cluster and Excel Services seem to be moving the company in the
    right direction from a technological standpoint. Plus, their recent announcement
    to invade the healthcare space has shown a new willingness to attack certain verticals.
    It still is an uphill battle to sell Microsoft within Capital Markets for anything
    but UI work ... but people are starting to listen!
