- en: Also notable from Friday afternoon is the fact that new highs contracted substantially
    while the S&P made a 50-day high. The percentage of stocks hitting new 52 week
    high dropped from a little over 7% on Thursday to under 5% on Friday. I looked
    at other times the SPX made a 50-day high while the drop in new highs equaled
    2% or more of the total issues.

    of the average decline. In fact that was somewhat weak. It was the fact that 95%
    of instances closed below the trigger day close at some point in the next 5 days.
    This suggests that while the lagging new highs might not indicate an immediate
    selloff, the market has consistently struggled to move higher.
