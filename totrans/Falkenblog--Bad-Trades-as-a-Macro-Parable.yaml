- en: There are two types of bad trades.  The first is the mode-mean trade where the
    mode is positive the mean zero or negative.  One shouldn't make this kind of investment,
    because at best it simply adds noise to one's portfolio.  The net return to the
    passive investor can be especially negative because often they mistakenly overpay
    for management, not anticipating the drawdown, and the agent does not payback
    old profits when this is all revealed. Such trades are common in financial markets,
    and savvy investors are very aware of them.  Junk bonds, writing out-of-the-money
    options, hurricane insurance, are good examples.

- en: Another type of bad trade is where losses are expected initially, but supposedly
    it's just a learning curve or scale issue, and eventually once all the ducks are
    in a row the positive cash flow supposedly appears.  These are more common, as
    with any high frequency trading strategy that burns transaction costs, not realizing
    that those close-to-close returns used in the back tests weren't realistic estimates
    of feasible net fill prices.

- en: The more money an investor has tied up in such trades the lower their total
    return over the long run. You can try to avoid them, but a better priority is
    to simply identify them and flush them when they reveal themselves. That is, getting
    out of bad investments is probably the single most important thing an investor
    can do,as opposed to finding alpha, which is simply much harder.

- en: Our economy has many such bad trades going on at any one time, and the sooner
    these are abandoned, the quicker people will reallocate their time towards something
    that actually costs less than its revenue.  Consider guarantees to farmers, which
    supposedly allow farmers to withstand the vagaries of weather, ensuring our very
    survival.  We have policies that encourage producer cartels, direct payments via
    subsidies, paying farmers to not farm, disaster aid, insurance subsidies, and
    export subsidies *and* import tariffs. So now farmers who suffered from the recent
    drought directly get fully insured payments, and those who avoided it get the
    revenue from higher prices.  This isn't helping us become more efficient farmers.

    potentially will pay off big eventually, but in practice are subverted by special
    interests into a focus on producers not consumers.  If the negative present value
    were revealed via the negative cash flow at market prices, an efficient response
    would be to reallocate capital and labor. Instead, these activities are propped
    up under the hope that mere time will allow some sort of critical take-off point
    in future productivity.

- en: Many like to deride the short-term nature of markets, but the long-term rationalizations
    of top-down industrial planning is much worse.  It's not like our non-market economy
    is allocating capital like Berkshire Hathaway, rather just a series of patches
    to problems created by prior programs.

- en: The best way to increase productivity is to stop doing things that have negative
    NPVs because these have massive opportunity costs, and this is best reflected
    by the true discounted cashflow *sans* government in its myriad forms. Obviously
    this is a pipe dream, but it's an example of the way government can help the economy
    and reduce spending simultaneously.

  zh: 提高生产力的最佳途径是停止做那些具有负净现值的事情，因为这些事情具有巨大的机会成本，而真正的折现现金流*减去*政府及其各种形式很好地反映了这一点。显然这只是一个痴人说梦，但它是政府帮助经济并同时减少支出的一个例子。
- en: There would be some costly adjustments, but as they say, when you are in a hole,
    stop digging. What is prudence in the conduct of every portfolio can scarce be
    folly in that of a great kingdom.
