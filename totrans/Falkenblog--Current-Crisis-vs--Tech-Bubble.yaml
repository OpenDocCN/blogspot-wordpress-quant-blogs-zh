- en: I've read about a lot of doom and gloom, and from a stock market perspective
    they are correct. But the financials, while bad, aren't that bad. Looking at total
    financial profits, for banks, broker/dealers, etc. with assets above $100MM (about
    1000 companies currently), and comparing them to all the technology companies
    (about 600 companies currently), we see that in aggregate the total losses were
    larger both relatively (relative to prior profits) and in absolute terms (total
    dollars lost) in the infamous technology bubble. These are total net income (including
    extraordinary items). Also, note that in the bubble crash, most tech companies
    reported losses (ie, 40% had profitability in the depth of the crash), while currently
    the figure is down sharply, but still most (70%) of companies are reporting positive
    net income (data through Sep 08, though only about a third of companies have reported
    for this recent quarter).
