- en: My index is created by taking all the constituents of these major indices each
    6 months and applying an optimization algorithm that minimizes variance using
    the prior year's daily data.  The solution defines a fixed set of weights over
    the next 6 months.  MSCI weights things more globally, and has 8 different constraints.
     It seems if you simply want a worldwide minimum variance, the little constraints
    about industries etc don't matter much in  risk/return effect.  This highlights
    that this problem has a 'flat maximum' in that solutions that are not so close
    to each other on one level are really close in terms of the ultimate answer.  See

    volatility, size, momentum, and value.  Everything here is correlated, and so
    implicitly ignoring these factors is impossible. The details that will matter
    are really based on assumptions on how these factors interact: whether factor
