- en: so yesterday i had surgery on my shoulder to repair a torn labrum and rotator
    cuff. it is hard to do much, because i can't move my dominant arm. but what was
    interesting was that everyone i met when i got there, nurses 1 thru 3, anesthesiologist,
    etc, all asked which shoulder (right)? three people even initialed the shoulder,
    so we would have an evidence trail if they did the wrong one, i guess.
