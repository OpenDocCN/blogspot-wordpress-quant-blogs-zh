    early 90''s, even being a contributing editor for their MSJ magazine for a while.
    Even back then, Microsoft was fairly cheap with the buck. They liked to work off
    of fixed-price contracts, and tried to get me to put in more functionality under
    the radar screen (ie: more features for no money). However, it was great to be
    involved with Microsoft during the salad days.'

    Tony Rizzo and Eric Maffei used to treat the NYC-based writers like royalty. I
    even got to have dinner with Bill Gates (more on that in a later posting). What
    a great crew of people! Charles Petzold, Ross Greenberg, and Greg Comeau. Miss
    you guys!
