    is very simple: each month, buy a number of stocks that performed the best in
    the same month a year earlier, and short the same number of stocks that performed
    poorest in that month a year earlier. The average annual return is more than 13%
    before transaction costs, and since it is market neutral, this already considerable
    return can be leveraged to 2 or 3 times higher. Also, since it turns over the
    stocks only once a month, transaction costs should not be a major problem. The
    strategy was developed by Profs. Steven Heston and Ronnie Sadka, and details can
    be found online'

    in the data set as a mean-reverting strategy, since survivorship bias would tend
    to lower its backtest performance by excluding very poorly performing stocks that
    we would short. All in all, it seems to be a market neutral strategy made for
    retail trading!
