    philosophy, let`s start back with first principles of equity investing.

    a company and therefore represent greater investment risk. Financial theory holds
    that higher risk should be rewarded with higher expected (average) return. While
    equities earn more than bonds, on average, they will be subject to higher levels
    of risk.

- en: GTT model is a way of mitigating some of the risks of equity investing. When
    it spots an unfriendly market environment for stocks, it imposes a greater degree
    of risk control with the use of moving average based trend following models. That
    way, the investor can avoid the worst of downside risk while capturing upside
    return.

    GTT model only addresses a recession risk forecast, but ignores the risks posed
    by excessively tight monetary policy. His GTT model would have stayed long equities
    during the Crash of 1987, when the Fed raised rates twice in September to defend
    the dollar. A proper asset allocation model also needs to consider the effects
    of central bank policy. Here is where I think I can add value to that modeling
    framework.
