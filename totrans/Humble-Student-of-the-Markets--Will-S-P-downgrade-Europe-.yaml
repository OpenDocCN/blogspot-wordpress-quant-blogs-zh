    over €1.8 trillion in 2012, or 19% of estimated GDP. Supposing that we assume
    that Germany will have no trouble rolling its debt and excluded her from 2012
    financing needs, then the eurozone debt market will see roughly €1.2 trillion
    in sovereign debt issues - an astoundingly large number. The PIIGS alone will
    need to finance about €700 billion next year.

    shrinking their balance sheets, which will reduce their appetite for sovereign
    paper, where will the money come from? The combination of EFSF and ESM? But the
    funding for the EFSF and ESM come from the eurozone sovereigns. Can they loan
    money to themselves?

    billion a week). The total cap adds to about €1 trillion a year, which could be
    a big bazooka if it was un-sterilized. However, such intervention would be sterilized,
