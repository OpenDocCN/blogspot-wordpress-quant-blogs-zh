    for housing--and another $100 billion or so of TARP money--and said: "Here is
    the equity tranche for a U.S. government-backed infrastructure bank. Go out and

    With a deficit of $1.4 Trillion, spending approved but not yet spent is not like

- en: 'Spending other people''s money on other people has a really bad ROE, highlighted
    by the total indifference to important issues like how money is invested. I would
    love to be this guy''s broker! Consider how hard it is to manage an infrastructure
    project of say, $10MM. To think that one can, top down, spend $50B and create
    value anywhere near $50B highlights a total indifference to incentives and a reliance
    on macro aggregates (C, I, G, M, v etc) that have proven as useful as Marxist
    conceptions of capital and labor: fun to talk about, but ultimately meaningless.'
