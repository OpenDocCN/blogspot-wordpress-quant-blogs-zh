    reports, today probably looked like just another in a series of uneventful days.
    For those who were paying attention to the likes of the [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures)
    and ETPs based on VIX futures such as [TVIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TVIX)
    (+10.7%) and [VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX) (+5.2%), however,
    the tension in the air was obvious.

    the big deal? It turns out that investors are easily spooked if the VIX (+2.6%)
    and the SPX (+0.1%) both move in the same direction. As the graphic below shows,
    the VIX and the SPX move in the same direction about 22% of all trading days.
    I think the real issue behind the concern about the direction of the VIX and the
    SPX is related to a hypothesis I laid out yesterday in [What the VIX Kitchen Sink
    Chart Says](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2012/02/what-vix-kitchen-sink-chart-says.html):'

    was in May 2007 and in looking at data from 1990-2007, I concluded that a [High
    Positive Correlation Between VIX and SPX Often Signals Market Weakness](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/05/high-positive-correlation-between-vix.html).
    When I ran the numbers this time around, it turns out that the market gyrations
    surrounding the financial crisis of 2008 and subsequent bullish rebound did little
    to change the overall conclusions.  The full data set (1990-2012) now shows that
    when both the VIX and SPX are up on the same day, the mean returns for the next
    1-100 trading days trail the typical returns for the full data set by a substantial
    margin and are negative through the first five trading days.

    days when the SPX is down and the VIX is up (the ROI +1 column refers to the performance
    of the SPX one day hence) and worst on days like today when the SPX is up and
    the VIX is up.  I have sorted the rows according to ROI +10 and in looking at
    the date, it is clear to me that some [mean reversion](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/mean%20reversion)
    is responsible for a good portion of the performance characteristics following
    the various VIX-SPX daily return permutations.  *[For the record, the data in
    the table below includes Fridays and Mondays, so it is possible that [calendar
    reversion](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/calendar%20reversion) may
    have had an impact on the results.]*

    just because the VIX and SPX both advanced on two consecutive days does not necessarily
    mean the planets are aligning for an [Aquarian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Aquarius)
    selloff. If investors are looking for that market reversal silver bullet, the
    SPX-VIX correlation data, while bearish, fall short of hinting at a major reversal.
