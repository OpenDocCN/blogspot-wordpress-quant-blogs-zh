    rising, their solution was to get the banks to write down the mortgages. Now,
    it's only the government giving mortgages to such people, a solution that isn't
    helping the housing industry. The key to creating persistent dysfunctional redistribution
    plans is to make them so big alternative narratives for its inevitable failure
    are defensible.
