- en: I’ve been getting some emails and read a few articles recently about the strength
    in Europe. And sure, since the summer of 2012 (when the Eurozone was actually
    being called an “experiment”) European stocks have rallied very nicely. But when
    looking at a longer-term chart, it appears like just a counter-trend bounce.

- en: FEZ consists of large cap eurozone stocks with global companies such as Total,
    Siemens and Daimler, which is more of a play on global growth and the competitiveness
    of European exporters. A better way to be exposed to European growth is DFE, which
    is the European small cap ETF, as small caps do more business in Europe and they
    are sensitive to the growth outlook in that region.

    small caps) clearly shows which region has the upper hand in relative strength,
    though DFE appears a bit extended against IWM.

    these things sometimes don't matter to the market until they matter. So he is
    inclined to stay with the momentum trade, but maintain a tight risk control discipline
    to limit losses.
