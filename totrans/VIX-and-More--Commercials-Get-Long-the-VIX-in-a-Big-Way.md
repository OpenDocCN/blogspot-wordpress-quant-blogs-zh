# VIX and More: Commercials Get Long the VIX in a Big Way

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/08/commercials-get-long-vix-in-big-way.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/08/commercials-get-long-vix-in-big-way.html#0001-01-01)

The chart below comes from [BuyTheBottom.com](http://www.buythebottom.com/) and reflects positions from the [Commitment of Traders](http://www.cftc.gov/marketreports/commitmentsoftraders/cot_about.html) report published last week. If you are not familiar with these reports there is no good short explanation I can offer, other than to pass along that conventional wisdom sees the commercials as the smart money in this equation. Their record is not great, but their positions generally have better predictive value regarding the future of the VIX than that of the large traders or the small traders.

I do not put a great deal of stock in the COT data, so I am posting the chart largely for informational purposes. Even if you don't agree with a dissenting opinion, it is important to pay attention to it, particularly if others do. Finally, if the commercials are correct, it looks like we have a category 5 volatility storm headed our way.
