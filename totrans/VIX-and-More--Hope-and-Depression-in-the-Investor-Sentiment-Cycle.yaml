- en: Charles Kirk of [The Kirk Report](http://www.kirkreport.com/) has an interesting
    post up, [The Investor Sentiment Cycle](http://www.kirkreport.com/2010/09/16/the-investor-sentiment-cycle/),
    in which analyzes the results of a recent survey he conducted in which he asked
    a broad group of professional investors to indicate where they believe investors
    are in the sentiment cycle, a graphic of which is at the bottom of this post.

  zh: 查尔斯·柯克（Charles Kirk）的[《柯克报告》](http://www.kirkreport.com/)上发表了一篇有趣的文章，《投资者情绪周期》（[The
    Investor Sentiment Cycle](http://www.kirkreport.com/2010/09/16/the-investor-sentiment-cycle/)），在其中他分析了最近进行的一项调查的结果，他问一组广泛的职业投资者他们认为投资者在情绪周期中处于哪个位置，该图表位于本贴底部。
- en: I am not sure of the exact origin of the [Investor Sentiment Cycle](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Investor%20Sentiment%20Cycle),
    though it was attributed to a graphic from 1998 by [Westcore Funds](http://www.westcore.com/)
    by [several sources](http://www.timothyross.com/letters/Cycle_of_market_emotions.pdf).
    My guess is that the chart evolved from a [similar graphic](http://www.powerswings.com/2006/07/02/the-sentiment-cycle/)
    from [Justin Mamis](http://mamis.com/about.php), which appeared in [The Nature
    of Risk](http://www.amazon.com/Nature-Publishing-Library-Contrary-Opinion/dp/0870341324/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpt_2),
    published in 1991.

    Funds](http://www.westcore.com/)的一张图表，由[几个来源](http://www.timothyross.com/letters/Cycle_of_market_emotions.pdf)提出。我猜测这个图表是从[类似图表](http://www.powerswings.com/2006/07/02/the-sentiment-cycle/)演变而来的，该图表由[贾斯汀·马米斯](http://mamis.com/about.php)在[《风险的本质》](http://www.amazon.com/Nature-Publishing-Library-Contrary-Opinion/dp/0870341324/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpt_2)中提出，该书于1991年出版。
- en: 'Given my recent discussion of the record highs in my proprietary [VIX Futures
    Contango Index](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20Futures%20Contango%20Index),
    extreme readings in the [AAII Investor Sentiment survey](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/AAII%20sentiment%20survey)
    (in the [newsletter](http://vixandmoresubscriber.blogspot.com/)), records highs
    in the price of [gold](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/gold), [record
    low Treasury yields](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/07/chart-of-week-record-low-yields-for-2.html),
    surging prices for default insurance for European [credit defaults swaps](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/credit%20default%20swaps)
    (CDS), etc. it is not surprising that the #2 response to the Kirk survey was that
    investors are going through a period of depression. On the other hand, the S&P
    500 index is now 69% above its March 2009 low, which is part of the reason that
    the #1 response to the survey was that investor sentiment is currently characterized
    primarily by hope.'

  zh: 考虑到我最近讨论的我的专有[VIX期货Contango指数](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20Futures%20Contango%20Index)创纪录的高点，[AAII投资者情绪调查](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/AAII%20sentiment%20survey)（在[通讯](http://vixandmoresubscriber.blogspot.com/)中）创纪录的黄金价格[，创纪录的低国债收益率](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/07/chart-of-week-record-low-yields-for-2.html)，欧洲[信用违约掉期](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/credit%20default%20swaps)（CDS）的价格飙升等。因此，投资者正经历一段抑郁期的#2回应并不令人意外。另一方面，标普500指数现在比2009年3月的低点高出69%，这是调查中投资者情绪目前主要表现为希望的原因之一。
- en: While depression and hope are adjacent in the sentiment cycle, the distinction
    in an investor’s psyche is an enormous one. With depression, there is a concern
    that current conditions will likely not improve and that investment opportunities
    carry more risk than reward. More importantly, the is such an anxiety about the
    future that investors worry that about the potential for markets to deteriorate
    to previous low levels and perhaps even get worse than they were in 2008.

  zh: 虽然情感周期中抑郁和希望相邻，但在投资者的心理中，这之间的区别是巨大的。在抑郁中，有一种担忧是目前的情况可能不会改善，而且投资机会的风险大于收益。更重要的是，对未来如此焦虑，以至于投资者担心市场可能会恶化到先前的低点，甚至可能比2008年更糟。
- en: Just around the corner from depression is hope, where the outlook is still mostly
    cloudy with a chance of sun, but there is a widespread belief (perhaps partly
    wishful thinking, but grounded in some tangible signs of progress) that the bottom
    is behind us and continued improvements are more likely than not.

  zh: 就在抑郁的拐角处，有希望存在，那里的前景大部分仍然多云，有阳光的可能，但普遍认为（或许部分是愿望思维，但基于一些可感知的进步迹象）最糟糕的时期已经过去，持续改进的可能性大于退步。
- en: Given much of the data I have seen and written about, I believe investors are
    still operating under the long shadow of 2008 (and beyond), with the result that
    their psyche is still under the influence of ‘[disaster imprinting](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/disaster%20imprinting).’
    In terms of the sentiment cycle, this puts them in the depression stage. My personal
    perspective closer to hope than depression at this point. I understand that hope
    is a concept that traders should avoid, but I do think that even with all the
    challenges to the global economy, hope is a more appropriate place to look for
    investment opportunities.

  zh: 鉴于我所看到和写过的许多数据，我相信投资者仍然在2008年（及以后）的长期阴影下操作，结果他们的心理仍然受到“[灾难印记](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/disaster%20imprinting)”的影响。就情绪周期而言，这使他们处于抑郁阶段。与抑郁相比，我个人更接近于希望。我明白对于交易者来说，希望是一个应该避免的概念，但我觉得即使在全球经济面临的所有挑战中，希望是寻找投资机会更合适的地方。

    futures) at 32, at least I have the comfort of knowing that I have a large margin
    of error before I have to worry about some of my trading ideas becoming unprofitable.
