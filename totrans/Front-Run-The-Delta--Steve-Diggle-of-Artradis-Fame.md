provides an illuminating look into Steve Diggle's

.  Mr. Diggle was one of the early entrants into the Asian hedge fund sector utilizing a "long arbitrage, long volatility" combination of strategies.  Since closing Artradis, Mr. Diggle has since started and currently oversees investment for his family office under the name

**Quotes.**

"On the one hand, being long volatility...in times of stress that has worked

[incredibly well](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aL_wJwPGiqoM)

. And Asia has had a long history of periodic crisis - they seem to come along every four years... we've had just a series of crises,

, but 2001 was very bad as well when the dotcom bubble burst, or 2000 I should say and then we had the SARs crisis, and then last year [2009] it was obviously a very significant crisis.  So the long volatility aspect, and we don't care how we buy volatility, we buy convertibles, we buy warrants, we'll buy options, we'll buy

as long as we think it represents good value." [italics, my own]

"The problem with that is when markets are quiet, you burn option premium,

as it's called in the industry. You have got to find something to fill that gap because hedge fund investors don't like losing money, nor do most people.  So, we focused on the other side of our proprietary trading experience which was arbitrage trading and although that is a phrase that has many different meanings to a lot of different people, when we mean 'arbitrage' we mean real arbitrage.  So, closely associated entities, whether it's dual listed stock, whether it's an

, convertible bond arbitrage.  Multiple strategy arbitrage in most markets in Asia you can, not rely on, but you can be confident that the underlying inefficiencies in Asia will give you arbitrage opportunities."

"We chose to come to Singapore in 2001 because we were attracted by a combination of things, all of which have remained I think significant selling points for Singapore as a hedge fund center.  Firstly, there's a cost component here, which is when we first started we were very cost-conscious.  We had virtually no assets under management so we had to be.  Costs in Singapore are significantly lower than they are in

and significantly lower than they are in Tokyo... they are materially lower.  More importantly, the

in Singapore continues to be extremely positive about hedge funds at a time when a lot of other jurisdictions are looking negatively at the hedge fund industry.  Singapore is continued to be extremely positive about hedge funds."
