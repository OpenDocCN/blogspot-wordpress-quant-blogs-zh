- en: Following on from the QuickStart HFT posting I made a short while ago, I came
    across the [Cheetah](http://cheetah-solutions.com/index.html) Framework based
    on the recent press [release](http://cheetah-solutions.com/pages/mkt/news/n1.html). 
    The Statistical [Arbitrage](http://cheetah-solutions.com/download/whitepapers/cheetah_wp_statarb.pdf)
    provide an example of how the various Cheetah cubs/blocks can be used.  I’m unclear
    of the cost compare to a go-it-alone FPGA solution, or which companies have successfully
    implemented a solution using the technology.  However, given that Cheetah Solutions
    appears to be based on Zurich, [Switzerland](http://www.cheetah-solutions.com/pages/mkt/news/n1.html),
    one has to assume a [Swiss](http://ch.linkedin.com/in/peterfall) bank or offshore
    hedge fund has been the initial client of the hardware stack.
