    given the increasing Fed hawkishness as well as concerns about a [Russian](https://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Russia)
    escalation in [Ukraine](https://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Ukraine)),
    what might the string of declines portend for stocks going forward?  I pose this
    question because I think the historical data is telling, with 30 such instances
    of 7-day declines in the 33 years of VIX data going back to 1990.

- en: What typically happens to stocks when the VIX falls seven days in a row?  Not
    surprisingly, if the VIX is continuing to fall, then stocks are almost always
    continuing to rise, to the point they becomes overbought.  Going forward, stocks
    have a tendency to see a one-day decline and some slight underperformance during
    the course of the next few days and up to a week.  At some point, whatever had
    been the fundamental driver of the decline in the VIX begins to regain control
    of the price movements in stocks and stocks move up sharply, with a high likelihood
    of outperforming the long-term average moves in stocks.

    7-day decline in the VIX relative to the average moves in the SPX during the same
    period.  You can see that the relative underperformance lasts five days, at which
    point the overperformance kicks in, with the maxim outperformance coming after
    100 trading days.
