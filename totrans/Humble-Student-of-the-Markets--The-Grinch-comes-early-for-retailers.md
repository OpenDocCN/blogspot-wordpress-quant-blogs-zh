# Humble Student of the Markets: The Grinch comes early for retailers

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2014/11/the-grinch-comes-early-for-retailers.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2014/11/the-grinch-comes-early-for-retailers.html#0001-01-01)

About a year ago, I warned about getting overly excited about the Black Friday hype (see

[Is Black Friday the time to sell the Retailers?](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2013/11/is-black-friday-time-to-sell-retailers.html)

). I had identified a seasonally weak pattern for retailing stocks in December. Hype about Black Friday retailing results didn`t help investors in these stocks either.

Sure enough, retailing stocks exhibited a pattern of outperformance into late November and then dropping off in December last year, as shown by the chart of the relative performance of XRT to SPY:

A glance at the seasonal relative return pattern for retailing stocks showed that they tended to underperform the market in December.

This year, I reiterate my warning. If you want to go shopping this Black Friday, I suggest that you don`t buy retailing stocks.
