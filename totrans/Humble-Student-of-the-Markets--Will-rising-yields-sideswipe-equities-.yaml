- en: Jerome Powell's Congressional testimony last week made the Fed's position clear.
    Monetary policy will remain easy for the foreseeable future. Inflation dynamics
    change, but not on a dime. While Fed policy will leave short-term interest rates
    anchored near zero, the market's inflation expectations have been rising. Last
    week, the 10-year Treasury yield briefly breached 1.6% and the 30-year Treasury
    yield rose as high as 2.4%.
