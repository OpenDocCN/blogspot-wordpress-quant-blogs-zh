    on a lot of cash, but not spending it. I don’t find that particularly puzzling:
    with huge excess capacity, why invest in building even more capacity. But almost
    everyone seems to agree that if we could somehow get businesses to spend some
    of that cash, it would create jobs.'

    spending, and spend it on, say, public works, this would also create jobs?....'

    more value than it spends. That is, if the NPV of spending is greater than 0,
    meaning not merely via some multiplier, but the spender himself expects to garner
    more money than he spends, otherwise the NPV is less than zero. Businesses may
    make mistakes, but surely this is their expectation, and generally they are correct,
    as profits, on average are positive (in spite of Marx's

    of self-interested exchange. In contrast, if the government spends $1B on a light-rail
    environmental impact study and Global Warming research, the payback is much less
    than the $1B. You can say such spending creates $1B+ in wealth through the multiplier,
    but many of us fiscal conservatives are skeptical of such multipliers, especially
    given the political context in which such spending decisions are made.

    it productive, it is that they are spending money where they by definition expect
    to create value. Decentralizing investment decisions, relying on individuals to
    create wealth, is the Invisible Hand. When government spends, this is hardly ever
    the case. It's a distinction with a difference, one that a true Keynesian simply
    can't understand.
