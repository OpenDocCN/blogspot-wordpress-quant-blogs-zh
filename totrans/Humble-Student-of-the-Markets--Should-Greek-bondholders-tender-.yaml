- en: posted an analysis from BarCap on whether Greek bondholders should tender to
    the "voluntary" exchange offer. BarCap concluded that on a probability weighted
    basis, bondholders should tender to the offer because the probability-weighted
    payoff is higher if you tender than if you don't.

    at BarCap's analysis of the payoffs if a bondholder tender decision under the
    two scenarios of successful and unsuccessful exchange.

    arrest. Following the separation of the two men, the police offer both a similar
    deal- if one testifies against his partner (defects), and the other stays quiet
    (cooperates), the betrayer goes free and the cooperator receives the full one-year
    sentence. If both remain silent, both are sentenced to only one month in jail
    for a minor charge. If each 'rats out' the other, each receives a three-month
    sentence. Each prisoner must choose to either betray or remain silent; the decision
    of each is kept quiet. What should they do?

- en: Here, regardless of what the other decides, each prisoner gets a higher pay-off
    by betraying the other. For example, Prisoner A can, with close certainty, state
    that no matter what prisoner B chooses, prisoner A is better off 'ratting him
    out' than staying silent. As a result, solely for his own benefit, prisoner A
    should logically betray him. On the other hand, if prisoner B, acts the same way,
    then they both have acted the same way, and both receive a lower reward than if
    both were to stay quiet. Seemingly logical decisions result in both players being
    worse off than if each chose to lessen the sentence of the accomplice at the cost
    of himself spending more time in jail.

    rates are relatively low, then the probabilistic approach is the correct framework
    as the unsuccessful tender scenario is dominant. However, as tender rates rise
    and approach threshold levels for a successful exchange, bondholders should start
    to think about this in game theory terms as there is a higher payoff by being
    the "free rider".

    is a bluff, then at current acceptance rates there is little incentive for bondholders
    to tender. If the 90% threshold isn't a bluff, then it's unlikely that we are
    going to get there and the tender will be unsuccessful in any case.
