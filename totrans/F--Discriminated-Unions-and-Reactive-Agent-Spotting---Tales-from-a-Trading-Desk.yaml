    What am I coding? Well for the time being lets just says its a combination of
    C# and F#. From the last few days of coding its clear the [Discriminated Union](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/chrsmith/archive/2008/01/09/f_2300_-snippets-_2d00_-enums-and-discriminated-unions.aspx)
    should be used for internal plumbing, and one should never attempt to use them
    from C# ‚Äì unless you want to endure a headache üôÇ As to actors, the key to actor
    usage is in my view identification of what would make a good actor. Actors remind
    me a little of the early days of [UML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language),
    where the identification of [nouns and verbs](http://uml-tutorials.trireme.com/uml_tutorial_4.htm)
    was a post conditions to use cases. Likewise actors and events appear to need
    a similar post condition.
