    six years surpassing the 37.57 [VIX spike](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20spikes)
    back on [January 22nd](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/01/brunhilde-day-today.html).

- en: With the weekend coming up and so much uncertainty in the markets, I am concerned
    that we may still be several sessions away from a [Brunhilde Day](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Brunhilde%20Day).
    On the other hand, a strong finish today on impressive volume and lots of breadth
    would help to make the case for an intermediate-term bottom.
