- en: HL Mencken noted that 'for every human problem there is a neat simple solution
    and it is always wrong'. Such simple solutions includes the idea that 'moral hazard'
    by bank executives largely contributed to the 2008 financial crisis. The examples
    given are always INVESTMENT bankers, who make great bonuses when they do deals,
    and then leave large liabilities that are toxic. Also, one can point to rich guys
    like Bear Stearns CEO Jimmy Cayne, who lost over one billion dollars but still
    walked away rich, worth over $500MM. It was heads they win, tails taxpayers lose,
    a game maximized at infinite variance.

    think they were very significant in the creation of the housing bubble. The 2008
    crisis hit all banks, not just investment banks. Most non-investment bankers get
    much more modest salaries and bonuses, often largely in at-the-money options in
    their firm's stock, with 5 to 10 year horizons. So, looking at the accompanying
    chart, which shows the

    25% bump around 2006, but the index now is still below its 1997 level. When I
    left KeyCorp in 1999 I had a bunch of options priced around $25-30, and as I left
    I had to exercise them. Who knew that if I had stayed, those options would be
    worthless, as the stock now trades around $8, light-years away from being in-the-money.
    Most of my retirement savings would have been erased with the 2008 crisis had
    I remained there (and I'd be living in Cleveland--a twofer!).

    income, to buy houses, was not that risky. Why this was so is interesting and
    complex, but I don't think it was as calculated as merely, 'well, I'll get rich
    lending the money, but won't lose much when it all goes downhill', because your

    started to take off. Yes, it was flat for a while, but between 2003 and 2007,
    the heyday of subprime, [the KBW index] went from 70 to almost 120\. I suspect
    those were some very good years for banking executives. Yes, they probably could
    not exercise their options immediately and some of them may have been stupid enough
    to hold on to them forever, but I would guess that they did just fine.

    tends to get out-sized compensation in all sorts of forms. But the decisions were
    made at all levels, especially the hundreds of mid-level executives who don't
    make millions, but it was they who really made the decision to originate and/or
    warehouse mortgages with 'innovative' underwriting standards (unlike Bob Rubin
    or Jimmy Cayne, who probably did not know, and never knew, what the distribution
    of loan-to-value ratios or other obligor metrics on mortgages were). If you assume
    these mid-level executives received 20-100% of their base salary in at-the-money
    options each year, they lost a lot of their wealth recently. They aren't poor,
    but if they thought this was a significant possibility back in 2005, they wouldn't
    have done it.
