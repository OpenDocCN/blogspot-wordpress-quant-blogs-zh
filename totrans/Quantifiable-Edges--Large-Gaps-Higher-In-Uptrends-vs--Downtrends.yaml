    the results of buying the gap up at the open and selling it at the close. What
    I found may again surprise you.

- en: When the market closes above the 200-day moving average, trying to buy a gap
    has been a losing strategy. Of the 123 instances I found looking back to 1994,
    only 57 had tacked on more gains by the end of the day. The rest finished down
    from their opening price. The net total movement of buying all these gaps up and
    selling them at the close would have been a loss of about 17.4% for the 123 trades.

  zh: 当市场收盘价高于200天移动平均线时，试图买入缺口一直是一个亏损策略。回顾至1994年，我找到了123个实例，只有57个在当天结束时获得了更多的收益。其余的从开盘价下跌。买入所有这些缺口并在收盘时卖出的总运动净亏损约为17.4%对于这123笔交易。
- en: Downtrends showed a different picture. Buying gaps up of 0.75% or more during
    downtrends was actually profitable. In this case, 58% of the 105 instances finished
    with the SPY closing higher than it opened. The net total of the movement from
    open to close was a gain of about 26% as opposed to the loss we saw above.

  zh: 下跌趋势显示了不同的情况。在下跌趋势中买入0.75%或更多的缺口实际上是盈利的。在这种情况下，105个实例中的58%以SPY收盘价高于开盘价结束。从开盘到收盘的总运动净收益约为26%，这与上面看到的损失形成了对比。
- en: I suspect short-covering is a big reason that large gaps tend to spark additional
    buying in downtrends but not in uptrends. Stops get blown through overnight and
    when they see the market getting away from them, panic-covering ensues.

  zh: 我怀疑短期回补是大型缺口在下跌趋势中往往引发额外买入而非上涨趋势中的主要原因。止损在隔夜被触发，当他们看到市场脱离他们时，恐慌性回补随之而来。
- en: Regardless of the reason it appears when the market is below its 200ma the easy
    money is typically made not by fading the large gap up, but by looking to go long.
    Fading large gaps up appears to be more fruitful in uptrending markets than down.
    These results seem to go against conventional wisdom and provide another example
    of a lesson that many traders may need to “un-learn”.

  zh: 无论出于什么原因，当市场低于其200天移动平均线时，通常不是通过做空大型缺口来赚取容易的钱，而是通过寻找做多机会。在上涨趋势市场中做空大型缺口似乎比下跌趋势更有成效。这些结果似乎与传统智慧相悖，并为许多交易者提供了一个可能需要“
    unlearn”的教训。
