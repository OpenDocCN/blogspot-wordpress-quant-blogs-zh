- en: Third, Beijing may use violence, perhaps real bullets, to crack down, in a Tiananmen-like
    confrontation. This is the least desirable outcome for both Hong Kong and Beijing,
    as it would stifle relations between the two regions for some time to come. It
    would dampen trade and investment with Hong Kong, harm the stock market, which
    contains a large percentage of Mainland-based companies, and put the Shanghai-Hong
    Kong Stock Connect program on ice. Currently, trade from the Mainland into Hong
    Kong measured at $384.8 billion in 2013, direct investment from Hong Kong into
    the Mainland weighed in at $73.4 billion in 2013, and the market capitalization
    of Mainland firms listed in Hong Kong amounts to $1.8 trillion. Disruption of
    these financial flows would cause a serious economic shock to both regions.

    A shock to the China/Hong Kong trade nexus, combined with an arrest in direct
    investment into the Mainland, would sharply impact the rest of the world, cutting
    off access to imported goods from China, and rerouting export channels to Shanghai,
    creating congestion and reducing exported goods to China. A crackdown would also
    call for an international response, possibly in the form of a trade embargo, as
    has been implemented against Russia. This would certainly disrupt trade, and would
    weaken economic ties between China and the West.

    1st deadline, the day of the national holiday, for the current HK executive CY
    Leung to resign. As well, this week marks the start of Golden Week holiday, when
    many Mainlanders go to Hong Kong to shop. Moreover, the protesters have boxed
