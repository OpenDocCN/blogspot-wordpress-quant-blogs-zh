    which suggested that investment banks probably put in a bottom last week.

    ETF](http://www.amex.com/?href=/etf/prodInf/EtPiOverview.jsp?Product_Symbol=XHB)
    below, it appears highly likely that the early January low of 15.18 will be the
    ultimate low for the cycle, as the index has already climbed over 50% from that
    level.  In fact, yesterday’s intra-day high of 24.45 was the highest this index
    has traded since September 2007.  As the index moves over its 200 day simple moving
    average for the first time in ten months and shows a sharp upturn in on balance
    volume, technical signals should continue to improve.

    here.  Nevertheless, as the investment banks and homebuilders move off of their
    recent bottoms, the [large amount of cash in money market funds](http://www.ici.org/home/mm_03_20_08.html)
    will undoubtedly become less anxious about returning to equities.
