    in case my numbers are way off base.2) The numbers have no connection whatsoever

    There are 3 partners, director of Human Resources, director of Benefits, director
    of Recruiting, two salespeople, director of marketing, plus administrative assistant.
    If we wanted to chop some dollars, we could probably combine the HR and Benefits.
    Some of the people are paid totally on commission, some partly, and some are strictly
    salaried. The partners pay themselves a fixed base salary. So, I am going to put
    this roughly at $1M.

    about 230 possible consulting days per year (365 days - 104 weekends - 15 vacation
    - 10 holidays plus some sick days). This means, if the consultant was billing
    for all 230 days, we would have to charge the client $1000 per day just to break
    even. Now, let's say that each consultant is allowed about 10 days of bench time
    per year. This brings our daily rate up to about $1100.How much profit margin
    should the partners have? From dealing with various headhunters, I would assume
    a good profit margin to be about 25-30%. This means that we should be charging
    a client about $1400 for a consultant.

    more junior than others. So, we create a rate card that goes from $1200 per day
    for a junior person, to $1600 per day for a senior person. This comes out to $150
    to $200 per hour.

    $320 per hour, and we had pharmas and other corporates in our clientelle.In yours
    costs, perhaps factor in some free consulting time to fix screw-ups, late deliveries,
    etc.What about training? If you want to justify your rate you need highly trained,
    up to date employees. This is why I left, my employer made no investment in me.
    I had to train myself on my time, which left me often working around the clock.10
    days on the bench per year! Man, I do NOT miss consulting!

- en: · Wouldn't the partners take a % of the profits rather than a salary?Possibly.
    Depends on how risk-averse the partners were. If I was a partner, I would pay
    myself a low salary ($100K) and then at the end of the year, divvy up the profits.What
    about training, free days to clients, sick days?I mentioned 5 sick days in my
    original post. Training is nice, and I would like to give at least a week of training,
    so that can be done during the 10 days of bench time. OK, let's add in about $100K
    for training. Free days to clients? Never heard of this!Why isn't the employees
    bonus based on a % of the profits the company makes?Because many smart people
    will negotiate a guaranteed fixed bonus when they join, especially since the debacles
    of 2002 and 2003\. But I might give an added "incentive" bonus to some of my best
    performers at the end of the year. OK, let's add another 100K.Based on your calculations
    the is a backoffice person for every 4 consultants? I hate to see the size of
    the backoffice for 1000 consultants10 people should be a constant. Even when your
    company grows to 100 people. In fact, at the start, I might consider consolidating
    the benefits and HR functions, and make the partners do more marketing. So, we
    can cut our staff back to 8.Why don't I offshore some of my the work?Never, never!
    This is what distinguishes my shop from other larger ones. Strictly all client-facing
    work.Can't your consultancy do fixed price?I abhor fixed-price contracts. We could
    do it, but perhaps under duress!One thing that I forgot to mention was finder’s
    fees. If I hire a person through an employment agency, then I have to pay then
    15-30% of the employee's first year salary. That's a significant chunk. Let's
    assume $30,000 for 10 people, and that's another $300,000.So, we have added another
    $500,000 in costs to our model. That's about $10K per employee. Gotta bump up
    the rate card by $50 per day. So, our rate card is now $1250 through $1650\. And,
    coincidentally, $1650 per day is what a lot of the top-tier banks pay for senior
    technical people.
