    data I developed with respect to economic data vs. expectations that I variously
    present in an aggregated format or across five groups of economic activity (manufacturing/general,
    housing/construction, employment, consumer and prices/inflation.) This time around
    I have elected to do both, with the aggregated data in the top chart and the detailed
    breakout in the lower chart.

    consistently topping expectations since late September and the stock market has
    risen in conjunction with better-than-expected news. The detail chart tells a
    more nuanced story. Here one can see positive surprises almost across the board
    in the fourth quarter of 2011, yet a rash of disappointments in 2012 in housing/construction
    as well as manufacturing/general economic data.'

    and general economic data that coincided with bearish downturns in stocks. So
    far in 2012, the disappointments in manufacturing and general economic data have
    not been able to put a dent in the stock market rally. My sense is that this data
    and the stock market will be moving in the same direction within the next month.
    Whether that means an uptick in the data or a downtick in stocks remains to be
    seen.
