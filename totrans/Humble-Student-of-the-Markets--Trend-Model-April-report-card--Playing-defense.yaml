    asset allocation, model which uses trend following techniques as applied to commodity
    and global stock market prices to generates a composite Risk-On/Risk-Off signal
    (risk-on, risk-off or neutral). I have begun updating readers on the Trend Model
    signals on a weekly basis and via Twitter @humblestudent as new developments occur.

    signal changed from negative to positive, as buy signals and the red down arrows,

    there is no substitute for actual performance. As a proof of concept, I started
    to manage a small account that traded long, inverse and leveraged ETFs on the
    major US market averages and, on occasion, sector and industry ETFs. Trading decisions
    were based on Trend Model signals combined with some short-term sentiment indicators.
    The inception date of the account was September 30, 2013 and the chart below represents
    an interim report card of that account. (For more details on how the Trend Model

    is intended to be an absolute return vehicle. While I do show the SPY total return,
    which includes re-invested dividends, for illustrative purposes, the SP 500 is
    not an appropriate benchmark for measuring the performance of this modeling technique.

    30-40% returns were supported by a stock market that went steadily up without

    it is now now, such conditions have led to reversals. I extended the analysis
    to show that the differential between the long-term (3-year) trend and short-term
    (6-month) trend is at levels consistent with past major inflection points like
    the Crash of 1929 and 1987 (bottom panel of chart). However, I would like to emphasize
    this analytical approach only predicts direction, not magnitude and therefore
    a major market crash is unlikely.

    seeing flat and choppy markets, which has led to disappointing Trend Model account
    returns. Once the market begins to fall, the Trend Model should spot the bearish
    impulse and profit by shorting into the decline, which I expect to be no worse
    than the 10-20% corrective episodes seen in 2010 and 2011.
