    an inherent contradiction in a couple of Trump's policies. His fiscal policy of
    tax cuts is pro-growth and therefore USD bullish, but his "America first" trade
    policy needs a weaker dollar. So what does he really want, a strong dollar, or

    his trade policy objectives. As Larry Summers pointed out, Trump's populist message
    of attacking trading partners like Mexico has the unintended effect of depressing
