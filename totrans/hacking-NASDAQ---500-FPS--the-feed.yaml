- en: The ArcaBook multicast data is just shockingly bad. its a raw tcpdump which
    is great but seems the exchange people kept the udp socket buffer to their default
    64KB size.. so when the traffic bursts it drops a awfully large number of packets.
    As ArcaBook protocol has a sequentially increasing sequence number(yay) thus easy
    to calc the sample data drops 8.2% of the packets! Which translates to 726K packets(not
    messages) dropped out of around 8.8M total packets... how can you verify bookeeping
    with this? Yes ArcaBookTCP dump should contain everything however dropping that
    many packets on a low < 100KB/s average stream dosen`t inspire confidence.

    for a single trading day (2008/11), volume levels that are actually interesting!
    Also major points for reporting trades on the same feed - Arca is pure quote data.
    The spec dosent provide a sequentially increasing number to check against, and
    its tcp data so in theory is complete but the books add up and the volume is 2
    orders of magnitude more. So... guess thats where the action is!
