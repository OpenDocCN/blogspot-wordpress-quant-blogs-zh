    pipeline, I always find that teams often forget about security testing, in a similar
    way to performance testing.  Teams seems to focus in code, then aContinuous Integration
    (CI) process at the outset.  Only later when they begin to have conversation about
    the first prod release do they become aware of the need for CD.  At the point
    of CD, they are still not thinking real CD, and thus have overlooked the needs
    of security (and performance), and are still fixated on the code – not the cleanliness
    of code.

    or similar in their tool chain.
