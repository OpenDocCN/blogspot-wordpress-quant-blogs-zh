    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    in the direction of the main Trend Model signal. A bullish Trend Model signal
    that gets less bullish is a trading "sell" signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend
    Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading "buy" signal. The history of
    actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of the trading model are shown by
    the arrows in the chart below. The turnover rate of the trading model is high,
    and it has varied between 150% to 200% per month.

- en: My formerly bullish inner investor is turning cautious. This major change of
    opinion is not without precedence. The chart below is a record of my investment
    calls, and it shows that I have been neither a permabull or permabear. I was correctly
    bullish when the stock market dipped in 2015, and I turned cautious in the first
    half of 2015, and in early 2018.

    bull market that began in 2009\. While this is not a call to sell everything as
    a bear market can take some time to develop, my inner investor is taking steps
    to rein in his risk exposure in preparation for a market top in the next few months.
