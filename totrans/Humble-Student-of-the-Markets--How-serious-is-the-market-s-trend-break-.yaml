    (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold
    extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa). Subscribers receive
    real-time alerts of model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of the email
    alerts is updated weekly [here](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/trading-track-record/).
    The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that
    began in March 2016 is shown below.

- en: It finally happened. I’ve been warning about the extended nature of the market
    advance since late January, and the pullback seems to have begun. The S&P 500
    violated a rising trend line that stretches back to November last Thursday. Friday’s
    market rebound didn’t help as it left the index below the rising trend line.

    I had hopes that market weakness in one group would be offset by strength in another,
    the rotating correction scenario isn’t working out.

    secondary support at the NVIDIA earnings report price gap at around 5000 and strong
    support at the breakout turned support at about 4800.
