## The Silverlight Push: Office Web¬†Apps

As Microsoft push Silverlight as the preferred client deployment model it will be interesting to see how WPF fairs üòâ [Office Web Apps](http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/?p=3666) I suspect will come out around the same time Silverlight 4 appears which should help to tune the Silverlight platform. I wonder if Office Web Apps will therefore target Silverlight 3 or 4.
