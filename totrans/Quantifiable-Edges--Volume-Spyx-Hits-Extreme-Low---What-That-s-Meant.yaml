    low number. I looked back at other times the S&P 500 volume Spyx indicator dropped
    this low. Going back to 1995, there were only 4 readings of -10 or lower. They
    occurred on 6/10/04, 4/28/08, 5/30/08, and 11/3/08\. In every instance the market
    was trading lower 2 days later. The average drop for the 2 days was over 1%.

    the volume Spyx can be especially effective when you also take the day’s direction
    into account. Low readings on up days tend to be especially bearish while high
    readings on down days tend to be especially bullish when looking out over the
    next few days. Below you can see the results following readings below 0 when the
    market also closed up on the day.
