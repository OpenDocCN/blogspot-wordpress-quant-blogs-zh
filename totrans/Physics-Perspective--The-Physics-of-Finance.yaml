    gathered at a conference in Dahlem, Germany for five days of discussion on the
    economic modeling of financial markets. After the meeting, the group issued a
    joint statement on the economic profession's failure to either see the financial
    crisis coming or to judge its ultimate severity. The lack of understanding, they
    suggested [in the conference report](http://www.debtdeflation.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/papers/Dahlem_Report_EconCrisis021809.pdf),

    roots of this failure to the profession’s insistence on constructing models that,
    by design, disregard the key elements driving outcomes in real-world markets.
    The economics profession has failed in communicating the limitations, weaknesses,
    and even dangers of its preferred models to the public.”

    of realistic market dynamics as the primary failing of the standard models used
    by economists. These models assume that markets tend to a state of balance or
    equilibrium, and pay no attention to potential positive feed backs -- among asset
    prices, investors views, new regulations and so on -- which might drive markets
    far away from a state of balance. Realistic models would seek to capture such
    processes from the outset.

    -- much of it in physics, but some elsewhere - which is beginning to fill this
    gap. The idea is to accept that markets like most other natural systems have rich
    and complex internal dynamics. As with the weather, terrific storms can brew up
    out of blue skies through quite ordinary natural processes. If the equilibrium
    fixation of traditional economics has pushed the study of crises to one side -
    as the study of those exceptional events that occur when markets fail - the new
    perspective aims to understand how crises of many kinds emerge quite naturally
    from market processes. As any glance at history shows, they surely do, and quite
    routinely.

    models of financial markets first developed in the mid 1990s at the Santa Fe Institute
    in New Mexico. It has come a long way since then, particularly in the past five
    years, and a growing number of economists and policy makers are beginning to take
    it very seriously. As just one example, Nature recently published

    buried, good riddance, to be replaced by more realistic and useful ideas emerging
    from the physics of finance.
