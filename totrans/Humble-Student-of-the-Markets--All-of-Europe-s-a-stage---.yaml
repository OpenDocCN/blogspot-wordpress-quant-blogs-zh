    signs of returning confidence in the euro,” ***Draghi yesterday turned the spotlight
    on “upside risks” to inflation***, which is now forecast to remain above the ECB’s
    2 percent limit this year. That suggests policy makers don’t plan to cut rates
    further or add to their 1 trillion euros ($1.32 trillion) of long-term loans to
    banks, economists said....

    you to do yours" as he hinted that not only would there be no further LTROs, but
    the next ECB step would be some form of tightening.

    money so that the system doesn't seize up. So how much of what Draghi said is
    bluster and how much is real?

    in Europe as the elites proceed with the Grand Plan. The German complaint is part
    of the chorus of doubt that accompanies the main show and so is the ECB response,
    but they are not likely to be significant. No doubt, the ECB has the power to
    derail everything should any government step out of line, but my guess is that
    everyone pretty much knows the score. If needed, don't be surprised if the ECB
    stepped up with further LTRO or LTRO-like programs. Recall that I
