# Humble Student of the Markets: How commodity tail wags the stock market dog

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2022/04/how-commodity-tail-wags-stock-market-dog.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2022/04/how-commodity-tail-wags-stock-market-dog.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models** 

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post, 

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The 

**Trend Asset Allocation Model**

 is an asset allocation model that applies trend following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. The performance and full details of a model portfolio based on the out-of-sample signals of the Trend Model can bsoe found

[here](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/trend-model-report-card/)

.

My inner trader uses a 

**trading model**

, which is a blend of price momentum (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa). Subscribers receive real-time alerts of model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of the email alerts is updated weekly 

[here](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/trading-track-record/)

. The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that began in March 2016 is shown below.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Buy equities*
*   Trend Model signal: Bearish*
*   Trading model: Neutral*

** The performance chart and model readings have been delayed by a week out of respect to our paying subscribers.***Update schedule**

: I generally update model readings on my 

[site](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/)

 on weekends and tweet mid-week observations at @humblestudent. Subscribers receive real-time alerts of trading model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of those email alerts is shown

**How strong is the commodity bull?**

How far can the inflation trade run? A long-term chart of the conventional inflation hedge gold shows a bullish cup and saucer pattern with strong upside potential.

By contrast, the CRB Index approaching resistance appears overbought and extended.

Here's why this matters. An analysis by 

[KKR](https://www.kkr.com/global-perspectives/publications/state-of-play)

 concluded that the US economy is in a late cycle expansion, which is a period of decelerating equity returns. As the Fed raises rates to choke off inflation pressures, the inflation-sensitive commodity bull will fade and take the stock market down with it as economic growth decelerates.

In effect, we have a case of the commodity tail wagging the stock market dog.
