    they may have fared over the years. I used SPY instead of the index for these
    tests so that gaps would be accounted for using stop orders.

- en: The entry techniques tested all looked for confirmation that the market was
    bouncing rather than simply looking to enter on a spike in the CBI. The exit remained
    selling on the close when the CBI closed at 3 or lower

    at 1) A move above the prior day’s high or 2) A move above the prior day’s close.

- en: Of these two options, a move above the prior day’s high worked better at avoiding
    drawdown. Both options saw two of the trades move from winners to losers – though
    the losses were quite small (0.05% and 0.64%).

- en: The third entry tested looked at buying at the first close that was higher than
    the previous day’s close (after the CBI hit at least 10). This seemed to work
    the best (good suggestion Tim). All 16 trades remained positive. The average gain
    was 2.2%. The maximum drawdown was 4.3% and the average drawdown was only 1.9%.
    For those who prefer to wait for confirmation rather than scaling in on the way
    down, a close higher than the previous day’s close seems to have worked quite
    well in the past.

    broke 10 as expected. Price is now more stretched and some of the measures I use
    there (RSI, Bollinger Bands, etc.) are now giving extreme readings.
