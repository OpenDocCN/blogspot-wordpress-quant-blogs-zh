    they did with TD Securities, which looks very much like an options market making

    great on the grid computing infrastructure offered by Blue Gene. And, if you want
    to marry System S with Blue Gene, you will find yourself few million dollars lighter
    in the wallet. But, then again, a trading firm can make that money up with one
    good day of trading.

    ... just to the ones that work for companies and government agencies that have
    multi-million dollar budgets for real-time analysis. IBM says "If you have to
    ask about the price, then System S is probably too expensive for you." The actual
    cost of System S will be a fraction of what it will cost to purchase and deploy
    the proper IBM hardware and hire the reams of IBM consultants to set everything
    up and customize System S.
