    takes a look at a landmark economics paper from just over ten years ago, one that
    I am sure (or at least hope) every macroeconomist, indeed every economist, knows
    fairly well. Given it's fundamental importance, I'm guessing it is by now probably
    a staple of undergraduate economics education. I'm referring of course to

    all the thousands of later papers in general equilibrium theory in the same tradition?
    Don't those all establish how a decentralized market can act to organize economic
    activity in a remarkably efficient way? We'll, actually, no -- because only a
    very small fraction of those studies have even tried to model the messy

    through learning, come to lead the market to its final organized state. And NONE,
    so far as I am aware, established by investigation a plausible dynamical story
    consistent with realistic human behavior. Hence, the nice story and metaphor of
    the Invisible Hand really has no plausible counterpart in standard economic theory;
    it remains no more than a metaphor, even if economists seem loathe to admit that.

    and really interesting. The insight inspiring (the late) Clower and Howitt is
    that human economies probably self-organize into functional states coordinating
    the disparate activities of many individuals in much the same way ant colonies
    organize themselves. It's not due to the far-sighted rationality of any one agent
    (ant or person), but due instead to organizing structures that emerge to help
    us relatively unintelligent individuals cope with a very complex world. In the
    words of Howitt from

    anthills, can exhibit behavioral patterns beyond what any of the individual agents
    in the system can comprehend. So instead of modelling the system as if everyone’s
    actions and beliefs were coordinated in advance with everyone else’s, as in rational
    expectations theory, the approach assumes simple behavioral rules and allows a
    coordinated equilibrium to be **a possibly emergent property of the system itself**.
    The approach is used to explain system behavior by “growing” it in the computer.
    Once one has devised a computer program that mimics the desired characteristics
    of the system in question one can then use the program as a “culture dish” in
    which to perform experiments.

    is that all economic models with an explicit micro-foundation, which is to say
    almost all models that one sees in mainstream macroeconomic theory, are “agent-based”.
    Some even have a multitude of heterogeneous agents (see Krusell and Smith, 1998
    and Krebs, 2003, among others). So what’s the big deal?

- en: The big deal, as Tesfatsion has emphasized on many occasions, has to do with
    autonomy. An agent in a rational-expectations-equilibrium model has a behavioral
    rule that is not independent of what everyone else is doing. In any given situation,
    her actions will depend on some key variables (prices, availability of job offers,
    etc.) or the rational expectation thereof, that are endogenous to the economic
    system. These variables will change when we change the agent’s environment, and
    hence her behavior cannot be specified independently of the others’. The household,
    for example, in a market-clearing model of supply and demand cannot choose what
    quantity to demand until told what price will clear the market. Likewise the agent
    on a Lucas island (a Phelps Island with rational expectors) cannot choose how
    much to sell until informed of the stochastic process determining aggregate and
    relative demand fluctuations.

- en: The problem with assuming non-autonomous agents is that it leaves the model
    incomplete, and in a way that precludes a deep analysis of the coordination problem.
    For if the model does not allow people to act without knowing the equilibrium
    value of some variable, then someone must have computed that equilibrium value
    a priori. In such a model there is no way to describe out-of-equilibrium behavior,
    and the problem of reconciling peoples’ independently conceived plans is assumed
    to be solved by some unspecified mechanism that uses no scarce resources...

    enough information could figure out on her own what the market-clearing price
    is going to be, or what the rational expectation of the price level is, and in
    this sense could act autonomously even in a rational-expectations equilibrium
    framework. But an economy full of agents that were autonomous in this sense would
    not be decentralized in the Hayekian sense, because no market would be needed
    to aggregate the diverse information of heterogeneous people, each of whom can
    do the aggregation in her head. Each would be capable of acting as the economy’s
    central planner, although in this case the planner would not be needed. Moreover,
    such an economy would have no need for macroeconomists, because everyone would
    already know as much as could be known about the macroeconomy. The coordination
    problem would be trivial. So by “autonomous” agents I mean agents that are endowed
    with behavioral rules that can tell them what to do in any given situation, independently
    of each others’ rules, even when no one has access to a correct model of the economy.

    upon since in work with other economists -- is that autonomous agents of limited
    intelligence working on their own in an economic setting can readily self organize
    their activities into a functioning system with an intelligence far beyond their
    own. In their model, the coordinating infrastructure is a network of firms that
    emerges to make it easier for people to find the goods they need, vastly simplifying
    the problem of matching producers and consumers. I won't spoil the story. See
    some of Howitt and his colleagues' most recent papers, such as

    a way to look at the mechanisms behind economic coordination in a much more specific
    way. When an economy gets hit by a crisis and goes into recession, things happen
    which cannot easily be reversed, and certainly not instantaneously. Firms go out
    of business and then do not exist. This leaves gaps in the coordinating network
    which puts additional stress on other firms or individuals. An economy, like a
    broken bone, has suffered real damage that requires both time and the consumption
    of resources to overcome. Of course, you cannot even begin to understand how the
    key coordinating infrastructure can be damaged, or how it might be repaired, if
    you have no theoretical apparatus to describe that coordinating structure in the
    first place -- this is the position of modern mainstream (neo-classical) economics.

    macroeconomic dynamics, displacing the older approaches; after all, it actually
