# Humble Student of the Markets: A test of support at S&P 4320

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2023/06/a-test-of-support-at-s-4320.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2023/06/a-test-of-support-at-s-4320.html#0001-01-01)

** Mid-week market update**: The S&P 500 daily stochastic recycled from overbought to neutral last week and stock prices pulled back. Initial support can be found at about 4320, with secondary support at about 4200, which is also the approximate level of the 50 dma.

Can 4320 hold?
