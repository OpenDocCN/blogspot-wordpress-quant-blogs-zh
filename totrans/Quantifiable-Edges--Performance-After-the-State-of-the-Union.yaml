     to examine SPX performance following past speeches.  The data table below looks
    back to 1982.  There were a few instances, such as 2001 and 2009 where the speech
    was not an official “State of the Union”, but was delivered under a different
    name.  I have included those speeches in the results as well.

    these speeches the country gets excited about prospects for the future?  But below
    is an equity curve assuming a 5-day holding period.

    there has not been a quantifiable edge.  I guess they just don’t write speeches
    like they used to.
