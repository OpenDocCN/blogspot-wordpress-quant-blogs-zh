    often in terms of country ETFs. I find that regional ETFs too often dilute some
    of the trends and ideas I am looking to capture. Further compounding the problem
    is that I have a tendency to think in terms of [emerging markets](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/emerging%20markets)
    and developed markets more than, say, broad geographic boundaries such as Europe
    and Asia.

    that if one looks at the performance of emerging and developed markets ETFs for
    both Europe and Asia over the course of the past year, the strong correlation
    is not between the geographies, but across the emerging/developed distinction.
    In spite of all the sovereign debt problems in Europe, emerging Europe ([GUR](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/GUR))
    has generally been the top performer of the group, but this performance has been
    closely matched by emerging Asia ([GMF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/GMF)).
    Not surprisingly, developed markets in Europe ([IEV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/IEV))
    have been more volatile and slight underperformers when compared to their developed
    market counterparts in Asia ([VPL](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VPL)),
    but the margin has been a relatively slim one.

    emerging Europe than developed Asia. Perhaps it is time to start rethinking our
    investing geography…
