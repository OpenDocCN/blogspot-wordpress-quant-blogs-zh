    In a way, they are idiot savants, good at one kind of thinking (acquisition),
    poor at another (facts, judgment). A friend of mine had a foreign exchange student
    from Germany last year, I think she was a junior (ie, about 17). The girl thought
    of it as a sexual vacation and remarked to the shocked mom that the African American
    boys were much better in bed than the white boys. The mom was rather horrified
    by the example set for her own little snowflake; however, I was wondering how
    to interpret this lapse in judgment. In one scenario, the German exchange student
    was making stereotypes based on a few people, and this is a bad habit. On the
    other hand, she might have had statistically valid sample sizes and been inferring
    correctly. Either way it wasn't a good example for her little American sister.

    our public schools is rather incoherent. He''s just getting his addition and subtraction
    down, and his latest homework had many questions on geometry: identify the isosceles
    triangle, the right triangle. Before algebra or trig I don''t see the point of
    going over geometry because you really can''t use these things, instead, you define
    things like ''parallelogram'', and that''s it. He should learn the point of a
    concept, like a right triangle, is to solve problems. Until he can do more math,
    these geometrical problems don''t help him solve anything, so it''s just pointless
    memorization.'

    forward when a concept (such as subtracting by 4 for single digit numbers) is
    mastered. Each week there's steady progress, and more complicated concepts are
    not addressed until students have mastered concepts necessary for their understanding.
    It's all about overlearning, tracking, and a thoughtful sequential presentation
    of ideas.

    for students to really learn them. Their efforts to make math 'relevant' makes
    it irrelevant, because the best way to teach relevance is to have what you learned
    last month essential for what you are learning this month,

    children. Part of her degree involves designing an experiment to test a hypothesis
    about learning. One would think, given hundreds of thousands of education Master's
    students--and their pet ideas for improving teaching--there would be progress
    in pedagogy out of all this, at least for straightforward subjects like math and
    reading. Alas, I don't think it is much better than what was taught in the early
    twentieth century, in spite of probably a million people formally exposed to teaching
    as a discipline, and studying this systematically, writing theses, journal articles.

    becoming popular, often based on patronizing ideas about developing creativity
    of both the teacher and the student. In pandering to parents and teacher's unions,
    saying "we have a rather rigid process to maximize your kid's learning" is not
    as popular as saying "tests don't measure anything. We should treat each child
    as if they were their own special kind of genius." One thing our
