- en: The problem estimating financial company default probabilities is that as long
    as an asset is performing--ie, not past due--they all look the same. A bank could
    have a bunch of mortgages where their borrowers had FICO score above 600, and
    20% equity in their houses (ie, good loans), or they could have mortages on borrowers
    with no money down, FICO scores below 500, and negative amortization loans. You
    have no way of knowing based on the data they present in standard financials.

  zh: 金融公司违约概率估算的问题在于，只要资产运作正常——即未逾期——它们看起来都一样。一个银行可能持有一堆按揭贷款，借款人的FICO信用评分高于600分，房产净值占比20%（即良好的贷款），或者持有按揭贷款，借款人没有首付款，FICO信用评分低于500分，并且采取负摊还贷款。根据标准财务数据，你无法了解到这些情况。
- en: But a firm like Bear should have a complete top-down risk report that aggregates
    their risks in a meaningful way, and so things like FICO scores, or subordination
    of the debt, should be available. If they can't pull this together, either they
    are hiding something, don't have this information, or think they have valuable
    trade secrets within their balance sheet. I truly doubt their firm's value is
    significantly generated by something as top-down as their risk exposures, but
    eventually they might have to to save their existence, and if they can't produce
    a concise summary, they should fold because this is a dramatic dereliction of
    duty.

  zh: 但像贝尔这样的公司应该有一个完整的自上而下的风险报告，以有意义的方式汇总他们的风险，因此像FICO信用评分或债务的次级性应该是可用的。如果他们无法整合这些信息，要么他们在隐藏某些东西，要么他们没有这些信息，或者认为他们的资产负债表中包含有价值的商业机密。我真的怀疑他们公司的价值是否主要由像风险暴露这样的自上而下因素产生，但最终他们可能不得不这样做以拯救自己的存在，如果他们无法提供简明的摘要，那么他们应该倒闭，因为这是一种极端的失职。
- en: I'm amazed how some big firms are really quite stupid, like when American Express
    lost over $1B in 2001 on junk debt. The president at that time, Kenneth Chenault,
    expressed shock at the losses, though the returns on the debt of 13% necessarily
    implied a large default rate risk.

  zh: 我对一些大公司的愚蠢程度感到惊讶，比如美国运通在2001年因垃圾债务而损失超过10亿美元。当时的总裁肯尼斯·切诺尔特表达了对损失的震惊，尽管债务的回报率为13%，这必然意味着很大的违约风险。
- en: I have no sympathy for Bear, because they should have the ability to convince
    people they do not have risk, and if they can't present information to that end,
    they are inept.

- en: 'update (3/17): I think this is a case of a liquidity event forcing bankruptcy.
    Bear would have made it if they could mark assets at book rather than market value,
    but the market value made them insolvent, and if they sold for $2, they knew they
    were insolvent if one looked at mark to market. Thus, a great value add for JP
    Morgan. It''s no different than if you all the sudden made Ford or GM recognize
    the size of their off-balance sheet liabilities (unfunded pension and health care),
    they would need a white knight.'

  zh: 更新（3/17）：我认为这是一种流动性事件导致破产。如果贝尔能够按账面价值而非市场价值标记资产，它们就不会破产，但市场价值使它们资不抵债，如果以2美元出售，他们知道如果按照市价计算，他们就资不抵债。因此，对摩根大通来说是一项巨大的增值。这与突然让福特或通用汽车认识到它们的表外负债（未担保的养老金和医疗保健）的规模没有什么不同，它们会需要一个白衣骑士。
