    recovery? John Autthers, writing at Bloomberg, proposed an analytical framework
    where investors view the coronavirus outbreak mainly as a China problem. The MSCI
    World with China exposure (blue line) has been far more volatile than the MSCI
    World Index (white line). The companies with high China exposure have tanked in
    response to the virus scare and dramatically underperformed global stocks.

    the wake of the coronavirus infection, the PBOC has responded with a tsunami of
    liquidity to support the market. Moreover, extraordinary measures have been put
    in place to forbid short selling, and to discourage major shareholders from selling
    their shares. In response the Asian stock markets have rocketed upwards after
    a brief corrective period, and global markets have followed suit with a risk-on
    tone.

    market is focused mainly on China and the coronavirus, should investors even try
    to fight the PBOC?
