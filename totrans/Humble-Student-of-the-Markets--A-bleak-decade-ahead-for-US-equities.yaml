    and US equities in particular.

    The model is based on US household allocation to equities and uses the levels
    as a contrarian indicator.

- en: Notice that the household equity allocation is the flip side of the coin from
    household cash — sometimes referred to as sideline cash. Higher cash levels are
    therefore bullish and, sure enough, household cash allocations have risen markedly
    as equity allocations have fallen. But backtesting has shown that household equity
    allocation is the better predictor. In fact, according to Ned Davis Research,
    it is able to explain 77% of the variation in the stock market’s return in all
    10-year periods since 1951\. I am aware of no other indicator that does as well.

    allocation data since 1951 and the stock market’s subsequent inflation-adjusted
    total return at each step along the way. Based on the year-end 2019 allocation
    level, that model projected a 10-year inflation-adjusted return of negative 1.3%
    annualized.

    are in, and we all know what happened in March, namely the COVID Crash. According
    to Hulbert, projected annualized real returns improved to a positive 2.3% based
    on March 31 levels. Fast forward to today, the market has recovered most of its
    losses, and expected inflation-adjusted returns are undoubtedly negative again.

    fees. If an investor were to create a balanced portfolio consisting of some stocks
    and bonds. Add in some trading costs and management fees, diversification and
    frictional costs could easily subtract another 1%-2% from overall returns.
