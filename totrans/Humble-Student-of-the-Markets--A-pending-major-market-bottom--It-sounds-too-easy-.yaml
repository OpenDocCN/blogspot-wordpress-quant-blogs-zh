- en: Is the universe unfolding as it should? Most technical and sentiment indicators
    argue for a near-term double bottom in the S&P 500\. The June bottom was the initial
    capitulation bottom. The market rallied and it is poised to weaken and re-test
    the old lows in the near future. That's when the new bull begins.

- en: The new bull narrative sounds far too easy. Macro and fundamental factors argue
    for further downside potential. The Powell Fed is in a "whatever it takes" mode
    to tame inflation. The 2-year Treasury yield has been climbing relentlessly, which
    is an indication of rising market expectations of a terminal Fed Funds rate. Forward
    P/E valuations are becoming increasingly challenging even as the E in the P/E
    ratio declines ahead of a likely recession. If support at the June low doesn't
    hold, SPY faces a possible air pocket and a rapid fall to the 260-320 support
    zone, which represents considerable downside risk from current levels.
