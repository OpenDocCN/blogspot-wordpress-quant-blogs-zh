    has been mired in a trading range since June with an upside of 1100-1130 and downside
    of 1020-1040 with little directional bias. As the stock market rallies into technial
    resistance in the 1100-1130 zone yet again, the question has to be asked, "Will
    it get rejected once more in this resistance area?"

    in say, the ECRI Weekly Leading Index and the ISM Purchasing Managers Index is
    about 13 weeks, and sometimes longer. The typical lag with respect to new claims
    for unemployment is about 23-26 weeks (***which puts the likely window of deterioration
    at about the October - November time frame***), and the typical lag with respect
    to the payroll unemployment report is, not surprisingly, about 4 weeks beyond
    that.

    stick their heads into very deep sand and ignore the fact that The Great Unwind
    had clearly begun. But in August and September 2007, even though the wheels were
    clearly falling off the global economy, the S&P still managed to rally 15%! The
    recent reaction to data suggests the market is in a similar deluded state of mind.
    Yet again, equity investors refuse to accept they are now locked in a Vulcan death
    grip and are about to fall unconscious.

    two weeks ago to very bullish today, the market is not likely to advance significantly
    from current levels. I believe that the more important test will come when it
    descends once again to the 1020-1040 level. Will sentiment swing once again to
    widespread fears of a double-dip slowdown or will there be sufficient complacency
    for it to fall through that important support level? Will economic data weaken
    to suggest a higher probability of a slowdown to warrant further de-risking?
