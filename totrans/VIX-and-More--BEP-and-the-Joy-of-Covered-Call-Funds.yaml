    trading at a 4.9% discount to net asset value and is an excellent way to capture
    some of the volatility premium in the current market without having to go to the
    trouble of establishing your own covered call portfolio. Looking at the chart
    below, while the SPX is down approximately 11% year to date, by writing covered
    calls against the SPX, BEP has managed a loss of only about 1.5% since the beginning
    of the year. Covered call funds will almost always outperform the SPX in down
    and sideways markets, but will generally have less upside potential in a bull
    market.
