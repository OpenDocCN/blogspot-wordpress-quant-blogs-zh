# Humble Student of the Markets: FOMC preview: 75 or 100 is the wrong question

Anticipation is building over the FOMC decision, which is scheduled for this coming Wednesday. Leading up to the meeting, there had been growing speculation over whether the Fed would hike by 75 or 100 bps. Market expectations had been oscillating wildly, but it has now settled into a consensus of 75 bps, followed by a pause in late 2022 and rate cuts that begin in mid-2023.

In my opinion, 75 or 100 bps is the wrong question to ask.
