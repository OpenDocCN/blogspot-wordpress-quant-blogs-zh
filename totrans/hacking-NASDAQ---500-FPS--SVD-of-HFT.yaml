    like such a long time. 3 years ago I couldn`t tell you the difference between
    buy, sell, bid, ask, long or short yet some how the projects and code I`ve written
    during this time now checks or trades, millions, tens of millions, hundreds of
    millions and sometimes billions of dollars every single day. The depressing part?
    all the time and effort in finance has not translated into

    back and work out **what** your missing and not even consider the how or where
    of the equation - just focus on the what. Lets take a high level look at the game
    from the top down.

    is a large component of any HF strategy however the trap technologist (like myself)
    fall into is, they believe technology alone can beat the market. What we dont
    realize is our technology edge starts and ends at the cable plugged into our box/switch.
    Theres so many other moving parts that are out of our control that tips the balance
    way into the red.

    risk checks let alone entering the exchanges infra. In Round 2 have best in class
    access to the market but the edge is gone once the packet has left the NIC. Net
    result, speed/technology is important but you cant win a trade with it alone.

- en: HF strategies are unique because the per trade profit is very small, which makes
    it extremely sensitive to the per trade and monthly recurring costs. For example
    if your trade makes +100 cents on a win and -100cents on a loss with say 100 shares
    eg. 1cent/share. Say your broker, the exchange, the SEC takes 25 cents or 1/4
    of the profit.

    even.

- en: Yet if your total fees is 5 cents vs 25 cents you need only a 3% edge (53%)
    of trades to break even.

    is extremely difficult. Thats just to break even!

- en: This one is probably a bit surprising to many as in theory an exchange is equal
    access for all participants. Thats the theory, yet in practice an exchange has
    finite manpower and equipment which results in the dude trading $100 / day vs
    the dude trading $100MM / day gets vastly different levels of service.

    a catch-22 situation. To join the club you need to trade massive volumes, but
    to trade (profitably) massive volumes you need A class access into the matching
    engine.

    with a shit ton of other crap between that endpoint and a trade thats in the exchanges
    control.

- en: For the HF game capital is usually not a problem. The true believers are flat
    at the end of the day with no overnight / borrowing costs. Intraday your capital just
    limits the sizes of your position. The one thing capitial does give you is, market
    access and influence with an exchange. Any tier one prime broker will want a few
    million dollars deposit before they will even talk to you. Next step down requires
    a few $100K and so on. For now capital is not an issue.

    then all the above can become noise. Yet the inverse is not true - you can have
    the best technology in the world but it will never make a bad strategy good.

    but what exactly needs to be learnt? The *what* is not an easy question. The first
    6months of this expedition was largely wasted doing essentially some form of technical
    analysis - if signal X crossed signal Y then buy/sell kind of strategy development.
    Im sure it works for someone but thats not the HF game to play.

    edge. The how to mine is an easy technology problem, the what to mine is not.
    Im convinced machine learning is the way forward as its the next logical step
    beyond stat arb. After all isnt stat arb a form of the most basic machine learning?
    guess it all depends on your definite of learning.
