    are 100% to 110% funded. At the end of the first quarter a number of large pension

    lower it became attractive to reduce growth assets and increase hedge assets.
    I think this explains the decline in Momentum stocks in April and the strong bid
    for long dated fixed income.

    because of last year''s stock market gains are selling to lock in their profits.
    They do this by selling the risky asset, stocks, and buying the risk-less asset
    relative to their liabilities, which are long duration bonds. The writer believes
    that this asset allocation shift has a long way to go because of the scarcity
    of long-dated Treasuries (emphasis added):'

    and long-dated Treasury prices rally while the world scratches their heads. In
    that case, there may not be a fundamental or valuation driven reason for equity
    weakness in the days and weeks ahead.

    a large weighting in momentum stocks and therefore I am exaggerating the momentum
    stock sell-off effect. I would tend to agree. However, I was quoting the analyst
    in his entirety. The re-balancing thesis from stocks to long duration bonds remains
    valid and would put downward pressure on equity prices and upward pressure on
    long Treasury bond prices.* *Cam Hui is a portfolio manager at [Qwest Investment
