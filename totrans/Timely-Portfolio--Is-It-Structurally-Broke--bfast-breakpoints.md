# Timely Portfolio: Is It Structurally Broke? bfast breakpoints

> 来源：[http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2014/03/is-it-structurally-broke-bfast.html#0001-01-01](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2014/03/is-it-structurally-broke-bfast.html#0001-01-01)

The R package `bfast` enthralls me.  I have [posted 3 times on `bfast`](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/search?q=bfast) but still did not understand the impact of the `h` parameter.  Armed now with some [d3.js](http://d3js.org), angular.js, and [rCharts](http://rcharts.io) I thought I could see it better with a fancy interactive visualization.  Here is the [result](http://rcharts.io/viewer/?9672236) when applied to the S&P 500 monthly price series since 1950.  You should see it embedded in an iframe below.  For the full effect, [click here](https://bl.ocks.org/9672236).
