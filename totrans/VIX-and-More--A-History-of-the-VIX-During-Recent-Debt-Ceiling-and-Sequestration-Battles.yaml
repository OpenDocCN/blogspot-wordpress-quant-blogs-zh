    since before any of us were born and while the debate has been heated at times,
    only recently has the credit of U.S. debt been called into question as a result.

    1995 and December 16, 1995 – January 6, 1996, for instance, there was nary a whiff
    of panic in the air, as the VIX never made it above 15 and spent a good portion
    of the shutdown in the 10s.

    than the Clinton-era budgetary battles and one only has to watch the trajectory
    of the VIX during these battles to get a sense of the uncertainty, anxiety and
    risk that was priced into SPX options during the period. Granted, none of these
    budget and debt ceiling battles has unfolded in a vacuum and the August 2011 debt
    ceiling battle played out against the backdrop of a dramatic worsening of the
    situation in [Greece](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Greece) and
    [euro zone sovereign debt](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/European%20sovereign%20debt%20crisis)
    in general, but the relative moves in the VIX during these three crises can still
    be instructive.

- en: Note that the August 2011 debt ceiling crisis is a classic example of risks
    that turned out to be much greater than almost everyone had predicted, whereas
    the fears related to the December 2012 sequestration crisis quickly disappeared.
    Historically there have been many more false alarms than crises which have escalated
    out of control, which is part of the reason why investors tend to underestimate
    and/or discount the full potential of each threat and why the [VIX has a tendency
    to spike](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20spikes) and then [mean
    revert](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/mean%20reversion) fairly quickly.

- en: With a little over a week before the October 17 debt ceiling deadline hits,
    the VIX is higher now than it was at a similar stage in July 2011 or December
    2012\. Certainly the political landscape has changed since the last two budget
    battles and both the Democrats and Republicans have had an opportunity to refine
    their strategies and tactics in the interim. How it all plays out this week and
    next is anyone’s guess. I still find it hard to believe that there will be a default,
    but that still leaves plenty of room for the type of “resolution” that drags out
    the current anxieties and leads to additional pitched battles – some of which
    may be even more costly – down the road.

    just in case…
