    NYSE Composite, it is on the verge of a buy signal, with the caveat that it’s
    never a good idea to front-run model readings. Significant market strength on
    Monday, which is the month-end, could tip the model reading into buy territory.
    Otherwise, the model should flash a buy signal in August barring a major pullback.

    a sell signal in late 2018\. It bought back into the market in 2019 and sold just
    as the market topped in early 2020\. It turned bullish again in late 2020 and
    became bearish in early 2022\.
