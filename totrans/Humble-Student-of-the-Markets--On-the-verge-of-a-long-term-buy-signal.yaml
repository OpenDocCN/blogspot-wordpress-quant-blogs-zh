    NYSE Composite, it is on the verge of a buy signal, with the caveat that it’s
    never a good idea to front-run model readings. Significant market strength on
    Monday, which is the month-end, could tip the model reading into buy territory.
    Otherwise, the model should flash a buy signal in August barring a major pullback.

    a sell signal in late 2018\. It bought back into the market in 2019 and sold just
