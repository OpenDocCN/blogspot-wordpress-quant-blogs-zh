    hasn't considered the possibility that the Republican Party could turn on itself.
    The GOP has been divided between two wings, the Establishment wing, as exemplified
    by the likes of George H. W. Bush, the classic East Coast Establishment patrician,
    and the social conservatives, as exemplified by Sarah Palin and the Tea Party.

    The social conservatives lost the nomination, but closed ranks with other Republicans
    and for the sake of the Party. The implicit message was, "You get your chance
    to make your mark this time."

    point fingers and try to blame the Establishment wing for the loss and split the
    GOP? If that happens, the Tea Party and their social conservative allies would
    make an ideological stand in order to differentiate themselves from the Establishment
    Republicans and send the country over the fiscal cliff like an innocent bystander.

    the Tea Party wing is getting wider. Consider how the MSM's interpretation on
    the current negotiations - that the Republicans have lost and they are seeking
    just to hold their gains while the Democrats are going on the offensive (as per

    President Obama and House leaders, GOP senators quickly cobbled together a plan
    to end the government shutdown — now entering its third week — and raise the $16.7
    trillion debt limit. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) then asked
    Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) to elevate negotiations to the highest
    level.

    broader goal is to turn the GOP into a “libertarian populist” party freed from
