    a rare event. In the chart below, I have highlighted instances where the dual
    condition of 1) the SPX at the lower Bollinger Band and 2) an oversold on the
    5-week RSI have existed. We have seen five instances in the past five years and
    we are seeing a sixth now. I have also drawn vertical lines marking those episodes,
    where the blue lines indicating that the market rallied soon after and red indicated
    that the market continued to decline. In only one instance did the SPX continue
    to fall and that was during the eurozone crisis of 2011.

    a clear fundamental trigger for the market weakness, these dual oversold conditions
    have marked near-term bottoms.

    of SARS (though not necessarily the human impact) was no doubt higher because
    of the much higher level of commerce done in Asia. The main economic impact of
    the Ebola outbreak so far has been on cocoa prices.

    favor a market bounce that could start at any time. After the reflex rally, however,
    I remain cautious on equities as global growth appears to be rolling over (see
