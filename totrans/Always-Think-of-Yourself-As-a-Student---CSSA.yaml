    or academics–as a student of those who are more experienced or talented. Through
    the course of “10,000 hours of practice” and a lot of guided learning, these same
    students will likely emerge as “experts” in their field (assuming they have enough
    talent). In an absolute sense, these people will always be “experts”, and much
    more likely to succeed or excel at their specific task than a rank amateur—-even
    in areas that involve luck such as trading or poker. The problem is that in most
    endeavours, experts participate in a  competitive game against their opponents.
    There is no question that nearly all NBA players can beat your or I at basketball,
    or that all MMA fighters could destroy us in the ring, but they don’t have to
    compete against us in reality. They have to face each other, and **the reality
    is that they have to always try to improve to avoid falling behind**. You often
    see in MMA that previously untouchable fighters start to lose their dominance and all
    of a sudden seem very ordinary relative to the new pool of players coming into
    the sport–even though the early generation is still in their prime. The newer
    pool is often: 1) hungrier–never count out ambition and desire to succeed especially
    when one is not afraid to lose 2) more talented—often as the rewards to any endeavour
    increase so does the available talent pool 3) better trained– often because of
    the barriers to entry into a sport increase over time, the newer players are better
    shape, have superior coaching, and also have more diverse training.'

    money managers, traders compete against other traders. Just when you think you
    are good, look out because someone better than you is just around the corner.
    You have to always work hard, and try to be one step ahead–otherwise my friend
    you are going to fall behind. No carribean island for you and no beach—I don’t
    see professional athletes these days lounging around and taking it easy while
    staying at the top of their sport. If you take a deeper look, anyone who has success
    or fame for the most part puts in an incredible routine or regimen to stay on
    top—this includes even Hollywood actors who often work out hours every day on
    top of their work on the set. Michael Jordan was arguably well ahead of everyone
    in his time, but he still spent more hours practicing free throws and jump shots
    than anyone else. During practice he played with an incredible intensity–a habit
    that was often mocked or disliked by his teammates. But guess what? Michael Jordan
    was Michael Jordan because of all of that–and no one ever hears or talks about
    the more talented players that never made it because they were lazy.

    good other people say you are, it really doesn’t matter. **Always think of yourself
    as a student–someone who always has something to learn. You must absorb as much
    as you can from other experts, and even question their root assumptions.  Once
    you become the expert, you have to learn to question your own root assumptions–because
    the only people you speak  to most often are looking for answers.** Those who
    never question will not only never find the answers, but they will also fail to
    truly understand how things work. This framework has been the foundation for all
    scientific progress. Its not even enough to know everything–you can know everything
    about fitness and the human body, but still be a fat and out of shape. People
    with lesser knowledge and skills can easily surpass you through sheer discipline
    and constant work ethic. You need to know what to do, and you need to actually
    do it for”10,000 hours” to really absorb the knowledge you have accumulated. If
    you haven’t done or are unwilling to do that then as a trader you are going to
    have to mechanize your trading–because no matter how much you know about the markets,
    you still have to know how to manage yourself just as much to succeed.
