- en: 'The intelligent person will start out in any given field–whether music, athletics
    or academics–as a student of those who are more experienced or talented. Through
    the course of “10,000 hours of practice” and a lot of guided learning, these same
    students will likely emerge as “experts” in their field (assuming they have enough
    talent). In an absolute sense, these people will always be “experts”, and much
    more likely to succeed or excel at their specific task than a rank amateur—-even
    in areas that involve luck such as trading or poker. The problem is that in most
    endeavours, experts participate in a  competitive game against their opponents.
    There is no question that nearly all NBA players can beat your or I at basketball,
    or that all MMA fighters could destroy us in the ring, but they don’t have to
    compete against us in reality. They have to face each other, and **the reality
    is that they have to always try to improve to avoid falling behind**. You often
    see in MMA that previously untouchable fighters start to lose their dominance and all
    of a sudden seem very ordinary relative to the new pool of players coming into
    the sport–even though the early generation is still in their prime. The newer
    pool is often: 1) hungrier–never count out ambition and desire to succeed especially
    when one is not afraid to lose 2) more talented—often as the rewards to any endeavour
    increase so does the available talent pool 3) better trained– often because of
    the barriers to entry into a sport increase over time, the newer players are better
    shape, have superior coaching, and also have more diverse training.'

  zh: '[智慧的人将以任何领域为起点 - 无论是音乐、体育还是学术 - 作为那些经验更丰富或更有天赋的人的学生。通过“1万小时的练习”和大量的指导式学习，这些学生很可能会在他们的领域中成为“专家”（假设他们具有足够的天赋）。绝对意义上，这些人将永远是“专家”，而且更有可能在他们特定的任务上成功或出色，甚至在涉及运气的领域，如交易或扑克。问题在于，在大多数努力中，专家们都在与对手进行竞争。几乎所有的NBA球员都能在篮球比赛中击败你或我，或者所有的MMA格斗家都能在擂台上击败我们，但在现实中，他们不必与我们竞争。他们必须面对彼此，**现实是他们必须不断努力改善自己，以避免落后**。你经常会看到在MMA中，以前无人能敌的选手开始失去他们的统治地位，突然间相对于新一代的选手似乎非常普通
    - 即使早期一代选手仍处于巅峰状态。新一代的选手通常是：1）更加饥渴 - 绝不要低估野心和渴望成功，尤其是当一个人不怕失败时；2）更有天赋 - 往往随着对任何努力的回报增加，可用的人才池也在增加；3）得到更好的训练
    - 通常随着时间的推移，进入一项运动的障碍增加，新一代的选手身体状况更好，接受更好的指导，并且接受更多种类的训练。'
- en: The same thing applies to trading. Big money managers compete against other
    money managers, traders compete against other traders. Just when you think you
    are good, look out because someone better than you is just around the corner.
    You have to always work hard, and try to be one step ahead–otherwise my friend
    you are going to fall behind. No carribean island for you and no beach—I don’t
    see professional athletes these days lounging around and taking it easy while
    staying at the top of their sport. If you take a deeper look, anyone who has success
    or fame for the most part puts in an incredible routine or regimen to stay on
    top—this includes even Hollywood actors who often work out hours every day on
    top of their work on the set. Michael Jordan was arguably well ahead of everyone
    in his time, but he still spent more hours practicing free throws and jump shots
    than anyone else. During practice he played with an incredible intensity–a habit
    that was often mocked or disliked by his teammates. But guess what? Michael Jordan
    was Michael Jordan because of all of that–and no one ever hears or talks about
    the more talented players that never made it because they were lazy.

  zh: 对交易也是一样。大型资金管理人与其他资金管理人竞争，交易员与其他交易员竞争。就在你认为自己很棒的时候，注意因为比你更优秀的人就在附近。你必须始终努力工作，并尝试走在前面——否则，我的朋友，你就会落后。没有加勒比海岛屿，也没有海滩——我没有看到职业运动员这些天悠闲地躺在那里，轻松地保持着自己运动的巅峰状态。如果你深入一看，几乎所有成功或名气的人都会制定一个令人难以置信的日常例程或制度来保持领先地位——这甚至包括好莱坞演员，他们经常在每天工作的同时进行数小时的锻炼。迈克尔·乔丹在他那个时代无疑远远领先于其他人，但他仍然花了比任何其他人都多的时间练习罚球和跳投。在训练中，他表现出了令人难以置信的强度——这种习惯经常受到他的队友嘲笑或不喜欢。但猜猜呢？迈克尔·乔丹之所以成为迈克尔·乔丹，正是因为这一切——从来没有人听说或谈论过那些因为懒惰而没有成功的更有天赋的球员。
- en: For this reason, you are never an expert. No matter how good you are, or how
    good other people say you are, it really doesn’t matter. **Always think of yourself
    as a student–someone who always has something to learn. You must absorb as much
    as you can from other experts, and even question their root assumptions.  Once
    you become the expert, you have to learn to question your own root assumptions–because
    the only people you speak  to most often are looking for answers.** Those who
    never question will not only never find the answers, but they will also fail to
    truly understand how things work. This framework has been the foundation for all
    scientific progress. Its not even enough to know everything–you can know everything
    about fitness and the human body, but still be a fat and out of shape. People
    with lesser knowledge and skills can easily surpass you through sheer discipline
    and constant work ethic. You need to know what to do, and you need to actually
    do it for”10,000 hours” to really absorb the knowledge you have accumulated. If
    you haven’t done or are unwilling to do that then as a trader you are going to
    have to mechanize your trading–because no matter how much you know about the markets,
    you still have to know how to manage yourself just as much to succeed.

  zh: 因此，你永远不是一个专家。无论你有多么优秀，或者其他人怎么夸你，这真的不重要。**永远把自己看作是一个学生——一个永远有东西要学的人。你必须尽可能多地吸收其他专家的知识，甚至质疑他们的根本假设。一旦你成为专家，你必须学会质疑自己的根本假设——因为你最常与之交谈的人都在寻找答案。**那些从不质疑的人不仅永远找不到答案，而且也无法真正理解事物是如何运作的。这种框架一直是所有科学进步的基础。仅仅知道一切甚至不够——你可以了解关于健身和人体的一切，但仍然可能会变得肥胖和不健康。那些知识和技能较少的人可以通过纯粹的纪律和不断的工作态度轻松超越你。你需要知道该做什么，并且你需要真正做到，才能真正吸收你积累的知识。”10000小时“。如果你没有做或不愿意做到这一点，那么作为一个交易员，你将不得不将你的交易机械化——因为无论你对市场了解多少，你仍然必须知道如何管理自己才能成功。
