    Renmimbi. The key is the RMB does not float. To get a 40% rise in valuation, China
    must buy or sell unlimited amounts of RMB against the dollar to maintain the desired
    price. That might mean a huge hike in Chinese interest rates to make holding the
    RMB attractive.

    decreasing China's demand for imports. This is yet another factor that Krugman
