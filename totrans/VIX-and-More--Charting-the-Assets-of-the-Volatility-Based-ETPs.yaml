    an Asset Class](http://online.barrons.com/article/SB50001424052970204201404576077942647562616.html?mod=BOL_hps_dc),
    I thought it might be interesting to track the history of assets for the volatility-based
    ETPs.

    I expect that in 2011, the share of both VXX and VXZ will drop dramatically as
    new entrants are responsible for most of the new money flowing into the space.
    In fact, I fully anticipate that buy the end of 2011, the $138 million currently
    in the “All Other” category will surpass that of VXX + VXZ. No matter how it plays
    out, one of the interesting stories of 2011 will be the degree to which investors
    embrace the most recent generation of volatility-based ETPs.
