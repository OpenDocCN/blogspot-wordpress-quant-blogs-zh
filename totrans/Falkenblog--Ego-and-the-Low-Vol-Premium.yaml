    more risk, lower return. It''s obvious in lotteries and gambling, where the most
    improbable events have the lowest expected returns, but true in less trivial areas
    such as options and stocks.'

    shots; to be a good average player, you need to merely lower your failure rate.
    In expert tennis, 80% of the points are won, while in amateur tennis, 80% are
    lost. The same is true for wrestling, chess, and investing: beginners should focus
    on avoiding mistakes, experts on making great moves.'

    are being aggressive, then any aspiring expert is forced to be aggressive because
    this signals to others that he truly is an expert, and finance is all about getting
    other people to give you money to manage. Thus it should come as no surprise that
    if you give people advise to invest in simple index funds or to focus on low volatility
    stocks because you can do little damage, and save a couple percent a year, many
    will dismiss this advice. The favorites of aspiring financial moguls are volatile,
    because one isn't going to hit a 'ten-bagger' on Coca-Cola (vol of 15%), but rather
    Netflix (vol of 70%).

    and after 20 minutes of practice (and secret recording), they were told they would
    receive $2 if they matched a time set to just below their actual average time,
    but $4 if they did some bit better than their average time. Subjects didn't realize
    this criterion for payout was scaled to their individual prior performance, but
    rather, thought they were from population averages (ie, those dopey other guys).

    subjects, the experimenter added the following remark: "Now, if you are worried
    that you might choke under pressure or if you don''t think you have what it takes
    to beat the target, then you might want to play it safe and just go for the two
    dollars. But it''s up to you."'
