    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    that was not the original intent of this publication, headlines have conspired
    to turn the focus on the Sino-American relationship. Now that an uneasy truce
    is in place, it is time to switch gears and turn the spotlight on other unexplored
    parts of the market.

    imagery of swans. Black swans. White swans. Grey swans. What is missing is the
    ugly duckling that grew up to be a swan. More importantly, what if an investor
    could identify an ugly duckling before it becomes a swan?

    of US stocks against the MSCI All-Country World Index (ACWI) in black, and the
    Euro STOXX 50 against ACWI in green. While there is no question that US stocks
    have been the winners, eurozone equities are in the process of making a broad
    saucer based relative bottom, and may be poised for a period of outperformance.
    The relative bottoming process is especially remarkable in light of the current
    environment of global trade uncertainty, which may be a signal of investor capitulation
    and the inability to respond to bad news.
