    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    that was not the original intent of this publication, headlines have conspired
    to turn the focus on the Sino-American relationship. Now that an uneasy truce
    is in place, it is time to switch gears and turn the spotlight on other unexplored
    parts of the market.

    imagery of swans. Black swans. White swans. Grey swans. What is missing is the
    ugly duckling that grew up to be a swan. More importantly, what if an investor
    could identify an ugly duckling before it becomes a swan?

- en: I have identified such a candidate. The chart below shows the relative performance
    of US stocks against the MSCI All-Country World Index (ACWI) in black, and the
    Euro STOXX 50 against ACWI in green. While there is no question that US stocks
    have been the winners, eurozone equities are in the process of making a broad
    saucer based relative bottom, and may be poised for a period of outperformance.
    The relative bottoming process is especially remarkable in light of the current
    environment of global trade uncertainty, which may be a signal of investor capitulation
    and the inability to respond to bad news.

  zh: 我已经找到了这样一个候选对象。下图表显示了美国股市相对于MSCI全球所有国家指数（ACWI）的相对表现（黑色线条），以及欧元STOXX 50相对于ACWI的表现（绿色线条）。虽然毫无疑问美国股市一直是赢家，但欧元区的股票正在形成一个广泛的相对底部，可能会迎来一段超越大盘的表现期。在当前全球贸易不确定性的环境下，相对底部的形成尤为引人注目，这可能是投资者投降和无力应对坏消息的信号。
