    computationally intractable* (p. 12). Needless to say, [the press](http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2009/12/28/its-impossible-to-price-a-cdo/)
    is already having a field day with the article to blame [Goldman](http://www.goldmansachs.com/)
    (arguably rightfully so, to the demise of their counterparties); despite what
    I wonder may be limited capacity to fully comprehend the subtle theoretical details
    of the article.

    way to distinguish such a tampered derivative from untampered derivatives…The
    paper suggests a surprising answer: in many models, even the problem of detecting
    the tampering *ex post* may be intractable.'

    theory, which Arora and Barak cover nicely in their recent text, [Computational
