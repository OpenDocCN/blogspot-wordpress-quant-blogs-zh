    according to recent projections by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, it will continue

    and employment, economists say. And that makes it less likely that the economy
    will pick up steam at the rate it did in previous recessions.

    and will have slower recoveries, than historically has been the case***,” according
    to a paper issued last month by James H. Stock of Harvard University and Mark
    W. Watson of Princeton University.

    outlier, with a comparatively youthful and growing population. This provides an
    unusual opportunity for America’s resurgence over the next several decades, as
    population growth elsewhere slows dramatically, and even declines dramatically,
    in a host of important countries.

    increase in the economic growth rate and particularly in employment.*** A growing
    population brings new entrants into the labor force at a rapid rate. Historically,
    a relatively positive relationship between workforce entrants and dependents,
    both old and young, has generated waves of growth across the past several decades.
    This is widely known as “the demographic dividend.”'

    aren't enough young workers to support retirees (Baby Boomers) as they age. However,
    this chart from Rob Gundlach shows that the US is in better shape than many other
    industrialized countries.
