    Now, Krugman has been so highly critical of Bush, one wondered if he would behave.
    But he played nice, and let his wife regale Bush with tepid tales about how her
    parents hosted his father at a fundraiser back in the day.

    intelligence, and their emotional intelligence. The lowest form of humor is both
    dumb and mean, like the traditional Polish joke where the punch line is all predicated
    on the fact that Polaks are stupid (eg, Q: How do you get a one-armed Polak out
    of a tree? A: Wave to him). But this joke is both dumb--Polish people are generally
    not stupid, Polish intellectuals include Copernicus, Banach, and Ulam--and mean,
    because they have basic punch line ''because they are stupid!'' It is a good thing
    that they don''t print ethnic joke books anymore (I had a dog-eared Polish/Italian
    joke book as a 9 year old).'

    is the punch line. Bush''s intellect is contrasted with the intellect involved
    in advanced mathematics, a contrast so vast it highlights that Bush''s intelligence
    is the polar opposite of that involved in ''piecewise continuous functions''.
    Like snarking to an obstreperous fat guy, ''listen, skinny...'' I doubt any of
    Krugman''s liberal heroes understand the importance of the Riemann integral, or
    its extensions, the Riemann-Stieltjes integral, and finally the Lebesgue integral.
    But who cares? Anyone who really understands these concepts understands also they
    are so parochial as to not indicate much about one''s intelligence other than
    that they had an aptitude'

    emphasizing that Bush is dumb. That's so funny! It is a sign of Krugman's irrational
    partisanship that he thinks Bush's is dumb, and that this matters. For a politician,
    Bush's IQ is probably average, estimated

    than IQ. More importantly, it is not true that people who disagree with you are
    either stupid or liars. Most journalists and academics are Democrats to be sure,
    but so are most felons and the underclass--do we split the difference?'

    indicates good character. Intellectual inferiority is a fact, but it is pathetic,
    worthy of sympathy not ridicule. A leader of a large group is usually of above
    average intelligence, but not too much so, and so the logic of one's side is not
    merely an IQ test between their two putative representatives. On any big issue--abortion,
    evolution, God, taxes, welfare, affirmative action--there are smart, honest, people
    on both sides. Some sides may be wrong, but neither side is intellectually indefensible,
    which is why we can't teach wisdom.

    works as a speechwriter for the much less intelligent Bill Bradley, as George
    Will worked for Reagan, and Frum worked for Bush. The front-men for any political
    side is rarely a genius, but that is the nature of leaders--they have other skills.

    thus can effectively implement his plans for extensive top-down spending. In this
    sense, he is consistent, if ultimately clueless Nobel Prize winning economist.
