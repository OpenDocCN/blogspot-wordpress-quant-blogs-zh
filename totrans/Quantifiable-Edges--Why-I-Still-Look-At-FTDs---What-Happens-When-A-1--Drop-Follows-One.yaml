    related to Follow Through Days (FTD) on the blog. The reader mentioned that the
    edges often provided by FTDs are not as compelling as many of my other studies.
    But one man’s trash is another man’s treasure. And while FTDs may not work as
    advertised and accurately predict new stock market rallies, they do a very nice
    job of defining the environment. A FTD tells us the market has undergone a correction.
    It tells us the market has made a multi-day move off the bottom. And it tells
    us that strong volume and price action have come into the market. Enthusiasm is
    picking up.

    based on the FTD, but we don’t need to know right away whether it is going to
    succeed or not to make good use of the information. While many of the past FTD
    studies on the blog and in the Subscriber Letter have focused on action on and
    around FTDs and what that might mean for the intermediate-term, it can also be
    useful to simply put the current day’s action in proper context so that we may
    better understand what that action may imply over the next few days and weeks.
    I use context in many other ways and people hardly notice anymore. Studies are
    always framed by where the market is. Is it above or below the 200ma? At a 20-day
    high? At a 20-day low? These are all helpful, but recent work has led me to believe
    that FTDs can be just as useful in defining context, if not more so. So I’ll continue
    to incorporate them and am optimistic that doing so may uncover some real gems.
    Anyway…we had a FTD Tuesday and then Wednesday the market sold off strongly. Strong
    enthusiasm has quickly turned. Let’s look at other instances and what has followed.

- en: The number of trades is a bit low, but the early indications appear to strongly
    favor another day of selling. Two things really strike me here. 1) There hasn’t
    been an instance in over 10 years. 2) Run-up/drawdown is heavily skewed in favor
    of the bears. Overall I find these results compelling enough to take under consideration.
