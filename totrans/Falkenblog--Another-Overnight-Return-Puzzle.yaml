    (overnight) vs. Open-Close (intraday). The intraday returns  are basically flat
    over the past 20 years.

- en: That's a curiosity  because 2/3 of the risk of stocks is from their intraday
    returns--measured by beta or volatility--so if return is compensation for risk,
    it doesn't seem consistent with that theory. However, there is further nuance
    I discovered that I haven't seen anywhere else. If you take all the tickers, the
    top 1000 non-etfs over the past 2 years, and rank them by prior daily volatility,
    and then look at their overnight returns, you see that volatility is strongly
    positively correlated with subsequent overnight returns, which then reverse over
    the next day session.

    risk premium, a negative intraday one.

    the average price in this sample is $43, making 0.15% generates 6 cents. Sounds
    great, but actually the returns are more concentrated for the lower-priced stocks,
    generating a return very close to the spread, ticker-by-ticker.

- en: 'While I think this pattern retains because it is too small to arbitrage, it
    is an interesting residual pattern. I think it is best explained by something
    like this: high vol stocks are targets of intraday trading. This demand is generally
    positive, and so what you have are returns being depressed at the end of day from
    day traders selling and closing their positions, returns at the beginning of the
    day pushed up by the day traders opening positions (generally buying).'
