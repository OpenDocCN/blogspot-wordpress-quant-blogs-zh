    oscillators. The whole concept behind most indicators of central tendency is that
    prices will stay contained within certain limits (such as in bollinger bands),
    and will oscillate with a regular tendency above and below the mean. One of the
    reasons the DV2 and the RSI2 work so well is that they capture the most regular
    oscillating frequency in stocks across all conditions, which happens to be roughly
    two days.

    makes a big difference in how all oscillators, channels or bands perform. First,
    amplitude is higher in bear markets than in bull markets. The definition of amplitude
    is that it represents the magnitude of change. Moves are much larger both up and
    down in bear markets than in bull markets, and this has been documented by academia
    and noted by several market practitioners. Furthermore, frequency is also higher
    in bear markets than in bull markets—there can be numerous swings from corrections
    to rallies within a given year. In bull markets, moves take much longer to develop,
    and only on rare occasions do they achieve significant magnitude in both directions
    (such as the Nasdaq in the late 90’s).

    knowledge can be used to improve performance. Most of the research done at CSS
    is on stock ranking, and for this type of research you need far more historical
    data. In many cases, our studies go as far back as the 1950’s. One of the most
    important variables in our models is momentum– we look at the relative strength
    of both industries and stocks within our rankings. The momentum effect is well
    documented as the most powerful anomaly in all of the academic literature. Even
    the high priest and promoter of the EMH (efficient markets hypothesis)- Eugene
    Fama concedes that this is a persistent and robust anomaly. The question is, what
    is the best way to use momentum? One combination stands out in the finance literature
    that works across ALL asset classes– a ranking of 12 month price returns. Our
    own research shows that this in fact is also useful to rank stocks and industries.

- en: One dirty secret about relative strength is that it does NOT work well in bear
    markets. I often read that this was the case, and unsuprisingly our results showed
    the same effect. But the concept of relative strength should be valid regardless
    of whether you are in a bull or bear market…..after all, some stocks outperform
    and other stocks underperform. They don’t arrive at those points instantaneously.
    The problem therefore, must be in the length of period used to measure relative
    strength. It dawned on me after considerable testing that the confounding difference
    lay in the increased amplitude and frequency in bear markets. Buying the biggest
    winners over the last 12 months greatly obscured the sector rotation that occured
    in the most recent period. As the bear market started, you would be long the biggest
    winners of the previous bull market. The result was that they would tank the most,
    because more people owned them. As the bear market dragged on, you would be long
    defensive stocks–which held up the best– only to watch them severely undperform
    when a major rally set in, lifting the worst stocks the fastest. Lastly, you would
    be long the biggest winners at the tail end of the rally (the laggards), only
    to be brutalized by a sudden correction.

    and 1 month price performance. This way, repsonsiveness could be drastically improved.
    By performing a mathematical learning procedure, the new rankings learned from
    past data. Most importantly, they were only allowed to learn from bear markets,
    when the 12 month average was falling, and only from bull markets when the 12
    month average was rising. The difference in the weights was signficant, with the
    12-month return receiving far less weight in bear markets than in bull markets.

    and bear market in the next post. Meanwhile, lets return to talking about how
    we can apply that to oscillators like the DVO as well as the DVI. Because these
    oscillators were designed to be flexible and adaptive (unlike the DV2), they can
    be improved without overfitting by allowing them to learn differently from bull
    and bear markets. The training procedure i like to use involves distingushing
    between bull and bear markets using a rising 252-day (1-year) average since we
    are daily data.

    entry/exit criteria. This results in a robust, and substantial improvement in
    the raw returns, as well as sharpe ratio of using either indicator. Taking a look
    at shorter term trend indicators like the ADX, fractal efficiency, R-squared, and
    the Hurst statistic  also provided valuable information for a separate training
    procedure. But it is important not to overdo things, otherwise we will lose degrees
    of freedom in our testing. This imposes a practical limit on the usefulness of
    new factors.

- en: To do this on your own, you don’t need to get that fancy. All you need to do
    is to use either common optimization, or brute force experimentation on both weighting
    schemes, lookback period, and entry/exit criteria. Of course, the only problem
    is that you may foolishly apply the absolute optimal settings, when broad generalization
    is most appropriate. To prevent this, I suggest you use deciles or quartiles instead
    of continous weights or entry/exit criteria. Furthmore, i suggest you test this
    across more than one index and ideally more than one asset class. More on this
    to come.

    the DVS.
