- en: This is a subject that is very important to understand when you attempt to use
    oscillators. The whole concept behind most indicators of central tendency is that
    prices will stay contained within certain limits (such as in bollinger bands),
    and will oscillate with a regular tendency above and below the mean. One of the
    reasons the DV2 and the RSI2 work so well is that they capture the most regular
    oscillating frequency in stocks across all conditions, which happens to be roughly
    two days.

  zh: 这是在尝试使用振荡器时非常重要理解的一个主题。大多数中心趋势指标背后的整个概念是，价格将保持在某些限制范围内（例如在布林带内），并且会以正常的倾向在平均值上下振荡。DV2和RSI2之所以效果如此好的其中一个原因是，它们捕捉了股票中所有条件下最规律的振荡频率，这个频率大约是两天一次。
- en: However, there are important differences between bull and bear markets that
    makes a big difference in how all oscillators, channels or bands perform. First,
    amplitude is higher in bear markets than in bull markets. The definition of amplitude
    is that it represents the magnitude of change. Moves are much larger both up and
    down in bear markets than in bull markets, and this has been documented by academia
    and noted by several market practitioners. Furthermore, frequency is also higher
    in bear markets than in bull markets—there can be numerous swings from corrections
    to rallies within a given year. In bull markets, moves take much longer to develop,
    and only on rare occasions do they achieve significant magnitude in both directions
    (such as the Nasdaq in the late 90’s).

  zh: 然而，牛市和熊市之间存在重要差异，这在所有振荡器、通道或带的表现方式上会产生很大影响。首先，熊市的振幅高于牛市。振幅的定义是它代表了变化的幅度。在熊市中，上涨和下跌的幅度都要大得多，这一点已经被学术界记录并被几位市场从业者注意到。此外，在熊市中，频率也比牛市高
    —— 在给定的一年内可能会有许多从修正到反弹的波动。在牛市中，行情的发展需要更长的时间，而且只有在极少数情况下才会在两个方向上取得重要幅度的进展（比如90年代末的纳斯达克）。
- en: Before i get into oscillators, i will give you a practical example of how this
    knowledge can be used to improve performance. Most of the research done at CSS
    is on stock ranking, and for this type of research you need far more historical
    data. In many cases, our studies go as far back as the 1950’s. One of the most
    important variables in our models is momentum– we look at the relative strength
    of both industries and stocks within our rankings. The momentum effect is well
    documented as the most powerful anomaly in all of the academic literature. Even
    the high priest and promoter of the EMH (efficient markets hypothesis)- Eugene
    Fama concedes that this is a persistent and robust anomaly. The question is, what
    is the best way to use momentum? One combination stands out in the finance literature
    that works across ALL asset classes– a ranking of 12 month price returns. Our
    own research shows that this in fact is also useful to rank stocks and industries.

  zh: 在我开始谈论振荡器之前，我将给你举一个实际的例子，说明如何利用这些知识来提高性能。CSS进行的大部分研究都是关于股票排名的，而对于这类研究，你需要更多的历史数据。在许多情况下，我们的研究可以追溯到上世纪50年代。我们模型中最重要的变量之一是动量
    —— 我们查看我们排名中的行业和股票的相对强势。动量效应在所有学术文献中都有充分的记录，是最强大的异常。甚至效率市场假说的主要推动者和支持者 Eugene
    Fama 也承认这是一种持久且稳健的异常。问题是，如何最好地利用动量？金融文献中有一个组合在所有资产类别上都有效——对12个月价格回报率进行排名。我们自己的研究表明，事实上，这也对股票和行业进行排名非常有用。
- en: One dirty secret about relative strength is that it does NOT work well in bear
    markets. I often read that this was the case, and unsuprisingly our results showed
    the same effect. But the concept of relative strength should be valid regardless
    of whether you are in a bull or bear market…..after all, some stocks outperform
    and other stocks underperform. They don’t arrive at those points instantaneously.
    The problem therefore, must be in the length of period used to measure relative
    strength. It dawned on me after considerable testing that the confounding difference
    lay in the increased amplitude and frequency in bear markets. Buying the biggest
    winners over the last 12 months greatly obscured the sector rotation that occured
    in the most recent period. As the bear market started, you would be long the biggest
    winners of the previous bull market. The result was that they would tank the most,
    because more people owned them. As the bear market dragged on, you would be long
    defensive stocks–which held up the best– only to watch them severely undperform
    when a major rally set in, lifting the worst stocks the fastest. Lastly, you would
    be long the biggest winners at the tail end of the rally (the laggards), only
    to be brutalized by a sudden correction.

- en: The intial solution it turned out, was to have variable weightings on 12 month
    and 1 month price performance. This way, repsonsiveness could be drastically improved.
    By performing a mathematical learning procedure, the new rankings learned from
    past data. Most importantly, they were only allowed to learn from bear markets,
    when the 12 month average was falling, and only from bull markets when the 12
    month average was rising. The difference in the weights was signficant, with the
    12-month return receiving far less weight in bear markets than in bull markets.

- en: I will present the results of different weighting schemes for the recent bull
    and bear market in the next post. Meanwhile, lets return to talking about how
    we can apply that to oscillators like the DVO as well as the DVI. Because these
    oscillators were designed to be flexible and adaptive (unlike the DV2), they can
    be improved without overfitting by allowing them to learn differently from bull
    and bear markets. The training procedure i like to use involves distingushing
    between bull and bear markets using a rising 252-day (1-year) average since we
    are daily data.

- en: Again this procedure results in different weights, as well as different optimal
    entry/exit criteria. This results in a robust, and substantial improvement in
    the raw returns, as well as sharpe ratio of using either indicator. Taking a look
    at shorter term trend indicators like the ADX, fractal efficiency, R-squared, and
    the Hurst statistic  also provided valuable information for a separate training
    procedure. But it is important not to overdo things, otherwise we will lose degrees
    of freedom in our testing. This imposes a practical limit on the usefulness of
    new factors.

- en: To do this on your own, you don’t need to get that fancy. All you need to do
    is to use either common optimization, or brute force experimentation on both weighting
    schemes, lookback period, and entry/exit criteria. Of course, the only problem
    is that you may foolishly apply the absolute optimal settings, when broad generalization
    is most appropriate. To prevent this, I suggest you use deciles or quartiles instead
    of continous weights or entry/exit criteria. Furthmore, i suggest you test this
    across more than one index and ideally more than one asset class. More on this
    to come.

  zh: 要独自完成这项任务，你无需变得那么花哨。你只需使用常见的优化方法或者蛮力实验来调整权重方案、回溯期以及买入/卖出标准。当然，唯一的问题是你可能会愚蠢地应用绝对最佳的设置，而不是选择最合适的广泛泛化的方法。为了防止这种情况发生，我建议你使用分位数而不是连续权重或买入/卖出标准。此外，我建议你在不止一个指数和理想情况下在不止一个资产类别中进行测试。更多内容即将推出。
