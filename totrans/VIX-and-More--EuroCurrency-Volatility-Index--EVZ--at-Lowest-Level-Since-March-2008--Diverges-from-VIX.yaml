    [EVZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EVZ), sometimes known simply
    as the “[euro](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/euro) VIX”), which
    is based on the [FXE](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/FXE) ETF, has
    toiled in relative obscurity compared to some of the more famous volatility indices.

    the [European sovereign debt crisis](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/European%20sovereign%20debt%20crisis)
    over the past few years, I find the lack of interest in EVZ to be surprising.
    After all, in thinking about the euro zone one of the most basic questions has
    been whether or not the euro will survive.  Further, outside of the U.S. at least,
    the future of the euro zone is still considered to be the [biggest risk to the
    stock market](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2012/10/us-fiscal-cliff-fears-top-vix-and-more.html).

    that today marks five years since the beginning of the historical EVZ data provided
    by the CBOE (reconstructed data fills the gap from November 2007 to the August
    2008 launch.)

    just before Bear Stearns collapsed and was sold to JP Morgan ([JPM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/JPM))

    the middle of September, is unusual, particularly given the length of the divergence

    to stocks? Is it possible that these two measures of risk can be moving in opposite
    directions and both be right?
