- en: Basically, international trade is predicated on comparative advantage, so that
    regardless of total productivity, if the relative productivity of nations in particular
    goods is different, there are gains from trade. That is, if I can make a $10 worth
    of wine in 1 hour, and $20 worth of cloth in 1 hour, and you make $5 worth of
    wine or cloth in 1 hour, it is best that I make all the cloth, and then buy all
    the wine from you, and you buy cloth from me. The essence of our relative productivity,
    presumably, if from differences in resources. But over time trade stopped being
    'North-South', that is, from developed countries in the Northern Hemisphere to
    non-developed countries in the Southern Hemispher (trading hi-tech goods for commodities),
    to more trade between developed countries. This was a puzzle to standard models,
    that would expect specialization in more fundamental items, like high-tech and
    low-tech. This is because technology should spread out over time, so Germany and
    France should have fewer comparative advantages relative to each other, compared
    to say Germany and Nigeria.

    (with an area within a country), a high tech sector in computers may get more
    and more productive, while an auto manufacturer may also get more productive,
    though both are 'high tech' in some sense. Thus, increasing returns to scale are
    important in explaining the growth of various economic sectors.

- en: This is a pretty good idea. It is simple, but that is not a knock. Indeed, many
    great economic ideas are simple, such as comparative advantage, the Invisible
    Hand, search theory, Nash equilibria, or ARCH models. That they can be refined
    mathematically is merely a plus for insiders, but I think the power of simple
    ideas highlights that there is probably too much mathematics in economics, because
    the level at which one can debate and discuss the returns to scale argument is
    really not aided by set theory, (s,S) inventory modeling, or dynamic programming.
    The number of really good economic insights--true and important--that are only
    discernible after learning graduate level mathematics, statistics or economics,
    is a pretty small set (

    a graph that shows new US auto plants are outside the geographies where there
    were increasing returns to scale at one time in this area (eg, Detroit), suggesting
    that there are no longer increasing returns to scale in certain geographies. The
    new plants are in the south. What is happening to increasing returns to scale?
    In my mind, it's clearly an attempt to get away from the UAW, the auto unions,
    which have made productivity growth near impossible with their onerous work rules
    and penchant for turning any ephemeral productivity increase into parri passu
    wage increases. So new manufacturers make sure they are far enough away to make
    unions less likely. Thus at one level, this Nobel Prize winning economist is still
    pretty much at 40,000 feet in explaining trends happening on the ground. A good
    idea, but it put academic economics in perspective.

  zh: 克鲁格曼随后显示，这种规模经济似乎正在减小。他提出了一张图表，显示了新的美国汽车工厂位于曾经存在规模收益递增的地区之外（例如底特律），暗示着在某些地理位置不再存在规模收益递增。新工厂位于南方。规模收益递增到底发生了什么？在我看来，这显然是试图摆脱美国汽车工人联合会（UAW）和汽车工会的行为，他们的苛刻工作规定和偏爱将任何暂时的生产力增长转化为平等的工资增长，使得生产率增长几乎不可能。所以新制造商确保他们距离联合会足够远，以减少工会的可能性。因此，在某种程度上，这位诺贝尔奖获得者经济学家仍然在解释地面上发生的趋势时处于40,000英尺的高度。这是一个好主意，但这将学术经济学放在了适当的位置上。
