- en: Walter Herrera, quality control and risk manager for the Chilean mining company
    GeoTech, has said his company was bringing a specialized device typically used
    for boring water holes to the mine. The drill would use one of the three bore
    holes already made as a pilot and widen the diameter to about 28 inches, which
    officials have said is wide enough for the miners to be hoisted through.

    would have been paid a risk premium for dangerous work and someone with rational
    expectations would have bought insurance to prepare for such an event. Drilling
    down half a mile through solid rock using specialized equipment can’t be cheap.
    Given the costs involved, do they deserve to be rescued?

    rescue? If the company pay, has it done a cost benefit analysis of paying compensation
    of no rescue vs. the cost of a rescue? (Does the company bear any legal liability
    in this case given the miners knew that they knowingly took risky jobs?) If the
    government pays, doesn’t that just socialize the costs, just like the banking
    bailouts? Should the miners themselves pay? After all, they should have known
    that mining is a risky job and therefore demanded a risk premium in their wages.
    If that was the case, why would they not have hedged (bought insurance) against
    such an eventuality? In the tradition of Hayek and Friedman, they were [free to
