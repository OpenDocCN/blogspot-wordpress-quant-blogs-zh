- en: Earlier today, in [Safe Haven Options Shrinking?](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2011/12/safe-haven-options-shrinking.html)
    I noted the recent failure of some of the safe haven trades in volatility, gold
    and crude oil securities to hedge the latest decline in stocks.

    – volatility ([VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX)), gold ([GLD](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/GLD)),
    crude oil ([BNO](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/bno)), the dollar
    ([UUP](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/UUP)) and U.S. Treasuries ([TLT](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TLT))
    – have fared over the full extent of the 2011 volatility storms, from the [Arab
    Spring](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Arab%20Spring) and Japanese
    earthquake/tsunami/nuclear disaster duo during the first quarter, to the U.S.
    [debt ceiling](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/debt%20ceiling) debacle
    and the seemingly endless wave of disasters associated with the [European sovereign
    debt crisis](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/European%20sovereign%20debt%20crisis)
    that plagued investors for the balance of 2011.

    think of anything as a safe haven that was down 46.6% peak-to-trough earlier in
    the year.

- en: Looking back with 20-20 hindsight, if one could have switched between safe haven
    vehicles at the most opportune time of the year, Brent crude would have been the
    best bet throughout the Arab Spring and up until early June, at which point gold
    would have been the horse to ride until August, with volatility the best play
    through the beginning of October and Treasuries the ideal [hedge](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/hedging)
    for the last two months. While the dollar has turned up as of late, the relatively
    low volatility in the currency market (assuming no use of leverage) means that
    the dollar is a better place to park investing capital until the perceived threat
    passes than to be employed as a hedge against a downward move in stocks.
