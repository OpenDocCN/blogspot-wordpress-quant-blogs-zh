    allocations at a large bank. Interestingly, she said that mortgages now had the
    same allocation as credit cards. When I was doing this in 1999, credit cards had
    the highest risk capital allocation within the bank, and mortgages were just above
    US Treasuries among 'safe' asset classes. Back then, historical loss rates were
    near zero, and 'underwriting innovations' were just a gleam in

    The underwriting (credit risk minimums and money down payment), the loss-in-event-of-default
    assumption (new legal risks), the 'willingness to pay', and collateral price volatility,
    have all changed significantly. Perhaps this is all endogenous, that a 'safe'
    asset like mortgages must become risky because everyone--investors, mortgage issuers,
    home builders, legislators, non-profits--all see it as a vehicle to achieve various
    ends.
