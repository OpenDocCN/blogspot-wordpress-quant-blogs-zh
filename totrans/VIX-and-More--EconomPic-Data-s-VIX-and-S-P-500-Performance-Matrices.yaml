    of Equity Returns](http://econompicdata.blogspot.com/2012/01/vix-as-predictor-of-equity-returns.html)
    in a post that examined the daily returns of SPY based on the level of the VIX.

    Matrix](http://econompicdata.blogspot.com/2012/01/s-500-vix-matrix.html), where
    the performance of both the SPX/SPY and the VIX are evaluated based not just on
    the absolute level of the VIX, but also based on the performance of the VIX over
    the prior month.

    other for VIX performance.

    and [mean-reverting](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/mean%20reversion)
    aspects of the VIX dominate the key takeaways from this table, with high levels
    of the VIX creating some sweet spots in terms of predictability of future returns
    for both the SPX/SPY and the VIX.

    the past: that the mean reversion characteristics of the VIX are much less compelling
    for a low VIX than for a high VIX.'

    on the chart, but the events that these encompass. A good reference can be found
    in [VIX Sets New Records, Suggesting Volatility Near Peak](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2011/08/vix-sets-some-new-records-suggesting.html),
    which I penned in August 2011\. The data in my August post should serve as a reminder
    that any set of data points which include a VIX of over 50 will be limited entirely
    to the [2008](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/2008)-2009 financial
    crisis. In contrast, just moving the relevant bucked down to 48 (on an intraday
    basis) will capture six other crises from the past two decades and provide enough
    diversity of experience from which to draw substantially more meaningful conclusions.
