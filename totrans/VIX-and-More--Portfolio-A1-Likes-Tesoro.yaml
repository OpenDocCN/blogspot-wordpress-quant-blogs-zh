    for a fifth a final holding for this portfolio.  This week [Enersis (ENI)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=eni&hl=en)
    has been dropped after drifting sideways for a week, to be replaced by [Tesoro
    (TSO)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=tso&hl=en).  In this instance, the
    change is more the result of Tesoro’s rising star than a particular dissatisfaction
    with Enersis: from mid-January to the end of April, Tesoro has more than doubled.  Still,
    a May 3^(rd) earnings report [failed to impress](http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/070503/earns_tesoro.html?.v=1)
    and appeared to stall the stock, yet gives the portfolio a chance to buy Tesoro
    in during what may turn out to be just a pause.  I would love to see some stability
    in the holdings and I think TSO’s prospects are probably a little better than
    predecessors ENI, [WCG](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=wcg&hl=en) (which
    looks to be recovering), [NTY](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=nty&hl=en)
    and [PCCC](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=pccc&hl=en).'
