- en: With today’s continued drop in the SPX (low of 1073.18 with 45 minutes left
    in the session), the index has now fallen 75 points from peak to trough. This
    is the second largest pullback in terms of points and percentage retracement since
    the March 2009 rally began.

- en: Keep in mind that to match the 9.1% pullback of June-July 2009, the SPX would
    need to fall to 1045\. The way the market is reacting negatively to what appears
    to be positive news, 1045 certainly cannot be ruled out.
