- en: The fundamental approach to investing is exemplified by the approach of Benjamin
    Graham, a very successful early popularizer of this approach. Graham was born
    in 1894 and started a brokerage in 1926, during the midst of an economic and financial
    boom. In 1928, he started also teaching a course on security analysis at Columbia.
    In a very influential book, Graham and Dodd’s Security Analysis (1934), and later
    Graham’s classic The Intelligent Investor (1949) , a generation of securities
    analysis’s learned how to evaluate stocks as investments. Sound investing was
    simply buying stocks below their intrinsic value, and avoiding stocks above their
    intrinsic value. Intrinsic value was a function of their balance sheet and income
    statement. Warren Buffett, was the only student in Graham's investment seminar
    at Columbia to earn an A+, and has tirelessly praised the man and his method.
    Interestingly, though Buffett wanted to work for Graham right out of school, Graham
    had a policy then of only hiring Jews at that time. Buffett never held this against
    Graham, and they ended up working together later.

    stocks, to bond yield, and if the Earnings/Price yield was significantly higher
    than what one would expect on bonds, the stock is good. Other valuation ratios
    were debt-to-equity, dividend yields, net current assets, book equity, and earnings
    growth. One applied these ratio into various formulae to find attractive stocks.
    Graham argued that the market is a capricious popularity contest, but ultimately,
    true value shines through, so the key is both prudence (knowing true value) and
    courage (not being dissuaded by short term fluctuations in the market).

    to intrinsic value (this in a lifetime when interest rates were typically single
    digit), a safety margin in his investing strategy. In this way, Buffet often says
    that risk and return are inversely related, because a 'good stock' necessarily
    has the least risk (eg, if it is selling for $4 and is worth $20, it is a good
    buy and has low risk). After buying, don’t pay much attention to the market price,
    and sell out when the business model changes.

    current assets, or even net cash, to market value, his approach grew to incorporate
    dividend growth over the next 30 years. Thus there are a few famous calls where
    firms were seemingly worth more in liquidation than as going concerns, and these
    he argued were good buys (thus the list above). After his 1934 volume, the Dividend
    Discount model was discovered, a way to explicitly handle growth, though this
    was mainly handled by one of his co-authors, Sidney Cottle, because Graham saw
    earnings projections as speculative.
