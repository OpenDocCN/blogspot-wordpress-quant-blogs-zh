Academia is an important participant in the quant world, contributing fundamental research across diverse fields: statistics, econometrics, information theory, signal processing, machine learning, dynamical systems, econophysics, optimization, information geometry, pattern recognition, data mining, and mathematical finance. Due to fragmentation and politics, there is no *single* place to monitor relevant research (both working papers and journal articles). While [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/) and [SSRN](http://papers.ssrn.com/) are hubs, many papers are published directly to widely varying journals.

This post is a *work in progress*, enumerating *key quant researchers who are actively publishing*, along with their respective affiliated institutions (academic, investment, or both), who are followed by Quantivity. This *list will be periodically updated*, and thus may be worthy of revisiting.
