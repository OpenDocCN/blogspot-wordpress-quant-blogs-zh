- en: First, an apology.  Last week I was on vacation and made a best efforts attempt
    to keep the information for Portfolio A1 current.  As you can see from the transaction
    log below, I posted an ‘update’ of the portfolio too soon and missed the signal
    to sell [Amkor Technology (AMKR)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=amkr&hl=en)
    and replace it with [AST Test Limited (ASTSF)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=astsf&hl=en),
    the Taiwanese semiconductor testing company.

    along with [Navistar International (NAVZ)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=navz&hl=en)
    in an effort to find a way to stop the bleeding.

    and [PepsiAmerican (PAS)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=pas&hl=en) – two
    relatively conservative plays that appear to be ideally suited to minimizing further
    downside risk rather than maximizing any gains from a bounce.

    return is now -13.7% and the peak to trough drawdown currently sits at -22.6%.  This
    will be a very difficult hole to dig out of, but I still like the long-term performance
    characteristics of this portfolio and have no intention of cutting the portfolio
    off without at least a year’s worth of performance statistics from which to learn
    some lessons.
