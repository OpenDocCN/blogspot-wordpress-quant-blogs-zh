    in the [OHFdex](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/OHFdex) (Overripe
    High Fliers Index) I [unveiled](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/10/from-overripe-to-vulnerable.html)
    back on October 12^(th), I though it might be interesting to see how these high
    fliers have fared during the recent market turmoil.

- en: Given that most major indices peaked at the end of October, I did not expect
    the changes from October 12 to November 20 to be particularly dramatic, but as
    can be seen below, the devastation over the past 5 ½ weeks has been widespread
    and substantial, even though it is only a small portion of most of the peak to
    trough losses over the past three weeks.

    so partly with a stronger post-October 12 runup, but also by doing a better job
    of weathering the current downturn.  These are the tech stalwarts, [AAPL](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=aapl)
    and [RIMM](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=rimm) ([GOOG](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=goog)
    was also up 11 points during this span), as well as the two Chinese tech plays,
    [BIDU](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=bidu) and [CHL](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=chl).

    past three weeks:  AAPL; BIDU; [GRMN](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=grmn);
    [DRYS](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=drys); and [CROX](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=crox).  I
    suspect that most of the easy money on the short side has already been made, but
    if the NDX fails to hold 2000 and if the NASDAQ composite cannot stay above the
    200 day SMA (currently 2584), I’ll flip from neutral to bearish and look to this
    list to find where the momentum money is most nervous.'
