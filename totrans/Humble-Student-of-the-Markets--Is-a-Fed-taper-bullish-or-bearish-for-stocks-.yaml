    which could mean keeping rates down longer. Fed staff research suggests the economy
    and job market might grow faster, without much additional risk of inflation, if
    the Fed promised to keep rates near zero until the unemployment rate gets as low
    as 5.5%. Goldman Sachs economists predict the Fed will lower the threshold to
    6% as early as December and reduce the bond-buying program at the same time.

    we would see every hedge fund piling into that trade and levering their exposure
    up 10 or 20 times and creating incredible global systemic risk. The main participants
    who are getting into that trade right now are Chinese companies that export and
    manipulate transfer pricing between their onshore (Chinese) entity and their offshore
    subsidiaries. Nevertheless, the exposure could be considerable and a Fed taper
    would be a signal to start the unwind of this carry trade. When the markets start
    to unwind a carry trade that is highly levered, the results are never pretty.
