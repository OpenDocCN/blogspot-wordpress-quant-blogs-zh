- en: Since the initial publishing of the Big Money analysis, on balance the predictions
    have been fairly accurate. I warned that Gold appeared to be a short-term false
    breakout–and so far that appears to be the case as it broke $1000 for a few days only
    to stall and fall back under. Natural Gas was listed as the most bullish and promising
    investment–although I cautioned readers to buy into strength and not weakness,
    and it has since risen nearly 40%. Oil was listed as bearish and has struggled
    considerably being down nearly10%. Incorrect calls were on the stock market, which
    rose nearly 6% following my ultra-bearish stance. Furthermore, the US dollar fell
    roughly 2% following my mildly bullish stance.  Financials were listed as ultra-bearish–and
    are flat  since the last recommendation, underperforming the S&P500 after leading
    for most of the rally. As a qualifier, this analysis is by no means the cornerstone
    of my trading, in fact the most important inputs are my proprietary DV indicators.
    Nonetheless, this is a non-correlated and longer-term source of information to
    confirm or disconfirm my analysis.

    numbers are very close to the ones that I calculate, and the difference is apparently
    that they are seasonally corrected. Steve Briese is the trader that publishes
    these numbers and has been dissecting COT numbers in his newsletter for a very
    long time. From now on, I will source my numbers from this site to save time gathering
    and processing the data. As you can see below, caution is warranted in Gold, the
    stock market, Oil, and short-term treasuries. There is a significant level of
    over-investment in these areas–making the risk versus reward unfavorable. Nonetheless,
    it is important to wait for technical confirmation before placing any big bets.
    If you want a neat way to combine short-term and long-term technical analysis
    with this COT information to trade ETFs the simplest way is to use ETFRanks by
    Market Rewind [http://marketrewind.blogspot.com/2009/09/etfranks-in-vs-out-of-sample.html](http://marketrewind.blogspot.com/2009/09/etfranks-in-vs-out-of-sample.html) Most
    of my research background is in creating stock rankings using quantitative methods,
    and I can quickly tell the difference between shoddy research and robust methodologies. Having
    a good sense of what is behind them, I know that they are loosely based on documented
    academic and practioner research. One of the best and quickest long-term investment
    strategies would be to create COT rankings and blend these with ETRanks to select
    the ETFs with the most favorable risk/reward.'
