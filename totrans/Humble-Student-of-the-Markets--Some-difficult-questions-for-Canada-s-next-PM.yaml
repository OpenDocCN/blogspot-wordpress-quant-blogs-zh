    question are related to either the economy or the economics of different policies.
    The issue in many of these questions is not to try and assign blame for what might
    have happened in the past, but to seek an understanding for what course of action
    the leader of each party is likely to undertake in the future. As Prime Minister
    Stephen Harper is the incumbent, most of the questions are directed to him.

- en: I fully understand the environmental concerns of the NDP to control resource
    development and, by extension, pipelines like Northern Gateway and Keystone XL.
    However, the capacity of the current North American pipeline system means that
    Canadian oil has really nowhere to go except for the United States. Consequently,
    Americans pay a discount for Canadian oil because they are the only customer that
    Canada can sell to. In some cases, Canadians pay a higher price for oil than Americans
    pay. In effect, what we have is a form of reverse NEP in place today. Then, Alberta
    was selling oil at the world market price abroad and Ottawa wanted a made-in-Canada
    price that was below the world market price. Today, Alberta is forced to sell
    both its light and heavy oil at a discount to the world market price because it
    has only one customer, the United States, while Atlantic Canada imports oil at
    the higher global market price.
