    Small English Town vs Two Large HFT Towers*. No happy end here for the “high-frequency
    trading”/network providers firms Vigilant Global and New Line Networks who seeked
    to erect two giant masts in Richborough to improve the Slough-Frankfurt microwave
    route. Last Thursday the Dover District councilors followed the planning officer’s
    recommendations and refused both the masts. An interesting moment (sorry for the
    typos when I was live-tweeting the meeting). It’s important to understand here
    that the debate about the mast *was not* about market structure, speed, arm race,
    the need to save a few microseconds to do arbitrage (or whatever), etc. A comment
    on Twitter said that “*If only SEC and int’l regulators did similar diligence
    as Dover city council when exchanges want to sell speed*” but the meeting in Dover
    was only about planning applications: the councilors had to decide about the erection
    of a 2-metre high boundary fence, the installation of a car park charging machine,
    the erection of a verandah, the formation of a “Juliette-style” balcony, and in
    the midst of all this, they had to decide about two heavy quasi-identical construction
    projects in Richborough. I was right to follow the more-than-one-year story of
    these masts as the most interesting here is the way HFT activities could have
    had consequences on the daily life of the people (living around the Banana land).'

- en: The Chairman (and his group) was at the centre of the scene, whereas the different
    councilors were around. On the left side you had chairs for the people who wanted
    to speak “against” an application, and on the right side you had (far less) chairs
    for those who wanted to speak “in favour”. For each application the DCC allows
    only one person to speak out against a project, and one person only to speak out
    for. Each of them had only 3 minutes to provide its views (that’s short). Unsurprisingly,
    when a person defended the erection of a 2-meter boundary fence, the nearest neighbor
    asked to speak against the fence. That said, expected when two women had an argument
    in the right corner of the room, the neighbourhood quarrels were peaceful. Everyone
    had precise arguments on each applications, and most of the time the councilors
    followed the officers recommendations. The meeting started at 6:00 pm and half
    an hour later the council decided to make a short break before discussing the
    Vigilant and NLN masts. Then the planning officer who was in charge came in the
    room with two large folders containing all the documents filed by the applicants (the
    documents I have been reading patiently for a year).

    2016. The room was very quiet, the Vigilant team, the McKay Brothers guy, the
    New Line Networks guy, me, Bass de Banaan and other neighbors – everybody was
    silently listening to the officer’s speech.

- en: 'The DDC officer described the Vigilant application (the banana land area, the
    need for an optical line-of-sight to transfer data between Slough and Frankfurt,
    the 322-meter mast, the fact other towers would deviate too far from the direct
    line between Slough and Frankfurt, etc.) and quickly raised issues about the consequences
    of such a giant tower. In short, the officer summarized what he wrote in its [report](http://moderngov.dover.gov.uk/documents/g2374/Public%20reports%20pack%2026th-Jan-2017%2018.00%20Planning%20Committee.pdf?T=10):
    most of the people living there are against the mast; it would be an eyesore in
    the landscape; the fact a lot of administrations/institutions disagreed with Vigilant’s
    statements regarding the ecological issues, the impacts on the Roman Fort and
    on the possible reopening of the Manston airport, the new National Grid project,
    and so on. The officer also talked about the St Peter church in Sandwich. He didn’t
    detail but St Peter is a good story: “*The Council’s heritage officer has considered
    in more detail the setting of St Peter’s Church in Sandwich. It is identified
    that the Dover District Heritage Strategy defines churches as being of outstanding
    significance, and notes that such buildings have value in their contribution to
    the aesthetics of the historic landscape and wider rural environment; it states
    ‘the spires of rural churches can often be seen over long- distances and are recognised
    and valued local landmarks*’.” For a very long time the tallest buildings, in
    the Western World, were church towers, and they needed a line-of-sight network. The
    officer: “*From the viewing platform of St Peter’s Church, there are far reaching
    views to the north towards the Church of Saint Mary in Minster. In this view the
    Proposed Development would draw the eye and detract from the inter-relationship
    between St Peter’s and Saint Mary*.” Here we have a battle between two line-of-sight paths: one
    between two old churches, the other between two telecommunication towers: “*there
    would be some harm, within the less than substantial range, to the significance
    of the setting of these churches*” wrote the officer. Don’t touch God’s network.'

    not agree on one mast is not a good sign, and all the benefits promised by the
    applicant “*are minor benefits compared to issues involved by such a giant mast*”.
    At this point it didn’t sound good for Vigilant. The officer concluded and the
    first speaker was invited to talk. As far as I understood, he is a local resident,
    a retired engineer, and he did a weird 3-minute speech against the Vigilant mast,
    saying that HFT is “*computerized gambling only*”, that this kind of activity
    could harm the market like the subprime crisis did, at some point he cited the
    Knight Capital debacle in 2012 – and that is ironic: the speaker said such a mast
    would improve speed and would have bad consequences (a new Knightmare) but he
    seemed to ignore that the Vigilant competitor here, New Line Networks, is a joint
    venture between Knight-Getco (known as KCG now) and another trading firm, Jump
    Trading. Anyway. After that, a Vigilant representative had his 3-minute speech
    and advocated for the mast (in short: “*we have been working on this project for
    18 months*, *we proposed NLN to share but they refused, there is no problem with
    the Fort, this mast would be temporary *[20 years though], *we offer a lot of
    contributions, we choose the area to mitigate the consequences* [true], *etc*.”.'

    said: “*Seriously, what does that look like?*” (*i.e.* such a mast is ugly), another
    talked about the major impacts the tower would have on the landscape, another
    talked about the consequences  on the Manston airport, another talked about “*layering*” and,
    in short, all the councilors said they don’t get the real local (and national)
    benefits such a mast could provide to the community. “*National benefit is minor,
    public benefit is more important than private [HFT] benefits*” stated the DDC
    chairman. The ten councilors voted and the hammer dropped: 9 against the mast,
    and one abstention. Boom. Vigilant had the best case, they worked hard to comply with all
    the issues raised by the DDC, but it was not enough. End of the story. Harsh.'

    or less the same statements. The best part was when he said NLN stated “*The tower
    in Houtem is not enough to achieve a perfect route between Slough and Frankfurt*”
    [at this point I thought: “so, why Jump spent $5,000,000 to buy the Houtem tower
    if it’s not that perfect?”]. Also (and this is an important legal point), the
    officer emphasized the fact NLN didn’t properly understand the purposes of an obscure thing
    named “[S106](http://www.pas.gov.uk/3-community-infrastructure-levy-cil/-/journal_content/56/332612/4090701/ARTICLE)”
    (Bass de Bannan was 100% right on that) and the legal issues about the Community
    Interest Company (which would collect the money from NLN before flowing it through the
    local institutions). What the officer was implying is that NLN didn‘t do a good
    job (the way NLN filed a last 40-page [document](https://planning.dover.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=documents&keyVal=DCAPR_229267)
    two days before the meeting, answering to questions raised over the last several
    months, proves that).'

    the councilors). Guess who asked to speak against the NLN mast? Vigilant of course,
    and the councilors had a good laugh as the Vigilant representative was now speaking
    from the left corner (against NLN) whereas he was sitting in the right corner
    minutes before (advocating for its own mast). In short, the Vigilant representative
    criticized the NLN mast with (sometimes) the same arguments the DDC officer had
    against the Vigilant mast minutes before. Weird moment, even if Vigilant had good
    points. Then the operations director of New Line Networks, who came from Chicago,
    had his 3-minute speech to defend its mast. I didn’t envy his position: the Vigilant
    mast was just wickedly refused by the DDC and he was trying to convince that a
    similar mast in Richborough would be important for the local and London/FinTech
    communities in a post-Brexit context. Trying to save a few microseconds in 3 minutes,
    in front of an angry crowd, is hard. Then the DDC chairman said “*we refused the
    Vigilant application for these reasons, we should refuse this one too*”, a Labour
    councilor had ironic words about the fact the two applications were not exactly
    the same (laughs in the room), the councilors voted and a new hammer dropped:
    10 councilors against NLN, and not even one abstention. Zero.'

    their mast – one point for the better work they did. But overall the “HFT” firms
    got a slap. Vigilant Global and New Line Networks wanted to erect two giant dicks
    in the middle of nowhere to save microseconds, and the Dover District Council
    responded with a “*Good bye*” (I liked the smile the officer). They just don’t
    want this thing in their backyard. Landscape *versus* money. It was too much. Here
    is the end of the *HFT in the banana* land spin-off. I assume competitor McKay
    Brothers (and other HFT firms) are happy. Of course the firms can appeal. I don’t
    know if they will but with what happened in Dover last Thursday, making appeal
    for *two masts *would be indecent and they would certainly get another slap. Vigilant
    is now walking around Tilmanstone, other are improving their networks elsewhere
    – latency depends on lots of factors. It’s time to leave *Lotus corniculatus*
    alone. After the meeting I ended up in a McDonald’s restaurant (the only one around
    the DDC offices) with brother McKay and the Vigilant team. They are nice and smart
    people, I’m sure they’ll find solutions other than putting a 300-meter mast between
    two churches. Good luck.'

    Vigilant Global和New Line Networks希望在偏僻的地方建立两座巨大的天线，以节省微秒，多佛区议会则回答道“*再见*”（我喜欢官员微笑）。他们只是不希望这玩意出现在他们的后院。风景
    *对抗* 金钱。这太离谱了。这就是“HFT在香蕉地”衍生版的结局。我猜竞争对手麦凯兄弟公司（以及其他HFT公司）会很高兴。当然，公司可以提出上诉。我不知道他们会不会这样做，但根据上周四在多佛发生的事情，为
    *两个天线* 提出上诉会很不得体，他们肯定会再挨一顿打击。Vigilant现在正在Tilmanstone周围游荡，其他人正在其他地方改进他们的网络 - 延迟取决于很多因素。是时候让
    *角果越橘* 自己呆会儿了。会议结束后，我和麦凯兄弟和Vigilant团队在一家麦当劳餐厅（DDC办公室附近唯一的一家）碰面。他们是友善又聪明的人，我相信他们会找到除了在两座教堂之间竖立一座300米高的天线之外的解决方案。祝他们好运。  '
