- en: It was a very good week for Portfolio A1 – and an excellent week for the portfolio’s
    top three holdings.  With [Mosaic (MOS)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=mos)
    gaining 13.4%, [Sinopec (SNP)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=snp) up 13.7%.
    and [DryShips (DRYS)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=drys) surging 22.8%,
    it is not surprising that the full portfolio tacked on 10.6% in a remarkable week.

    12.2% gain is 10.4% better than the meager 1.8% gain in the benchmark S&P 500
    index.

    [PepsiAmericas (PAS)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=pas) is being swapped
    out for [Fresh Del Monte Produce (FDP)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=fdp)
    in a move that I cannot attempt to explain.  As fun as it has been watching and
    commenting on the doings of this mechanical portfolio, I am looking forward to
    rolling out a discretionary portfolio at the beginning of the new year.
