    Republicans are now using budget votes to advance a political cause, the abolition

    seat. On Thursday, nearly all of Berlusconi’s senators threatened to resign if
    it did so. In response, Letta flew back from a visit to New York and called for
    a vote of confidence early next week. The following day, Berlusconi pulled the
    plug. Nominally, the motive was over Letta’s failure to stop a rise in Italy’s
    value added tax. “The decision taken yesterday by Prime Minister Enrico Letta
    to freeze government activities… is a serious violation of the pacts on which
    this government was formed,” Berlusconi said in a statement.
