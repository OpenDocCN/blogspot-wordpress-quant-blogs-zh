    five instances since 1970 when the market appeared overvalued based on this metric.
    The market had already begun falling in two episodes (red boxes: the Nifty Fifty
    top and the GFC), and this indicator signaled tops in three (grey boxes: Volcker
    induced bear market, 1987 Crash, and the Dot-Com Bubble). Is a success rate of
    60% (three out of five top calls) enough for an effective sell signal?'
