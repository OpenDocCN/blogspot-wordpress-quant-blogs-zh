    but of human subgroups based on ethnicity, religion, race, and sex.

- en: Tolerance of diversity is has morphed into celebration, and in the process took
    something salutary and turned into something destructive. Some think diversity
    encourages the active and complex kind of thinking because it puts students in
    uncomfortable situations, but diversity is usually the most scripted and routine
    parts of their education, because for decades now, the diversity agenda has taught
    them all the safe answers to their smarmy questions.

- en: Equating group disparities with racism on the part of the more successful group
    guarantees mutual resentment. As overt discrimination fades, still large racial
    disparities in success leads African Americans to conclude that racism is not
    only pervasive but also insidious because it is so unobservable and unconscious.
    Whites resent that nonfalsifiable accusation and the demands to feel guilty, if
    not directly compensate, African Americans for harm they do not believe they caused.

- en: Once we encountered the world’s diversity with prejudice, disgust, erotic excitement,
    pity-—but also curiosity. Now we look at it incoherently, as both vastly important
    (in explaining inequality) and utterly irrelevant (in explaining fundamental differences
    between races). Such nonsense quickly instills in one an incurious attitude towards
    diversity in order to avoid offense and nonsense. Ask a professor why black sprinters
    dominate the 100 meters, and you'll often here something silly and a quick change
    of the topic. Ask that same professor why blacks have lower socioeconomic status
    in the West, and you'll hear a confident exposition on institutional racism. Smart
    people learn to just avoid the subject.

- en: The diversity mantra implies class membership trumps individual character in
    determining moral standing. It should be no surprise that this belief has failed
    to improve the lot of those regarded as oppressed. It inverts Martin Luther King's
    call to judge people by the content of their character, and in the process creates
    a greater divide.

  zh: 多样性口号意味着阶级成员资格胜过个人品格，决定道德立场。毫不奇怪，这种信念未能改善被视为受压迫者的命运。它颠倒了马丁·路德·金对人们以其品格为评判标准的呼吁，并在这个过程中制造了更大的分裂。
