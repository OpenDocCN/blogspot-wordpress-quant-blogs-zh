    fighting, but it''s actually less dangerous than boxing, because a hurt boxer
    gets more punches to the head, where a hurt fighter is pounced upon and usually
    submits to a choke quickly. The combination of jujitsu--with emphasizes joint

- en: BJ Penn, the headliner in this event, is truly amazing, simply a natural genius
    at this sport. I had a suspicion his opponent, Sean Sherk, was in for trouble
    when he asserted that because Penn is from a wealthy family, he is soft. Comfort
    without struggle—and the sense of insecurity that motivates it—leads to disproportionate
    amount of self destructive decadence, and presents a unique challenge to wealthy
    people raising children. But that's a stereotype, and just as we should override
    group average information when assessing an individual we know a lot about, BJ
    Penn has issues, but I don't think his affluence is really operative right now.
    To think the poor kid will beat the rich kid because 'he wants it more' is simply
    not true.

  zh: 本次赛事的头号选手BJ·佩恩真是令人惊叹，简直是这项运动的天才。我怀疑他的对手肖恩·谢尔克会陷入麻烦，因为他声称，由于佩恩出身富裕家庭，他很软弱。舒适而没有挣扎的生活——以及由此产生的不安全感——会导致自我毁灭式的堕落，并给富人抚养孩子带来独特的挑战。但这只是一种刻板印象，就像在评估我们了解很多的个体时，我们应该忽略群体的平均信息一样。BJ·佩恩确实有问题，但我认为他的富裕并不是当前的主要因素。认为贫穷的孩子会击败富裕的孩子是不正确的。

- en: a headliner. He can't break out on his own, because no one is going to pay $40
    to see the 10th ranked fighter moving down. As the head of the competing IFL stated,
    if he thinks the UFC doesn't pay him enough, he should understand that no other
    league will be able to pay him anything close. Further, say the UFC is worth $1B,
    should Ortiz have a piece of that? Well, no. Sure he helped build the brand, but
    he had a contract, and was an employee. Perhaps he should have negotiated some
    options, but you can't argue for them ex post. So, while I'm sure Jameson is qualified
    to give advice on all sorts of things, her flawed analogy between his status as
    'talent' and hers, is just wrong. Bad analogies are at the bottom of every bad
    business decision.

  zh: 一个头号明星。他无法自己站出来，因为没有人会支付$40来看第十名选手下降。正如竞争对手 IFL 的负责人所说，如果他认为 UFC 不给他足够的钱，那么他应该明白，其他联盟也无法支付他任何接近的数额。此外，假设
    UFC 的价值为10亿美元，奥尔蒂兹应该拥有其中的一部分吗？嗯，不应该。当然，他帮助建立了品牌，但他有合同，是一名雇员。也许他应该谈判一些选择权，但你不能事后争辩。因此，虽然我相信詹姆森在各种事情上都有资格提供建议，但她关于他作为'天才'的地位和她自己的错误类比，是错误的。糟糕的类比是每个糟糕的商业决策的根源。
