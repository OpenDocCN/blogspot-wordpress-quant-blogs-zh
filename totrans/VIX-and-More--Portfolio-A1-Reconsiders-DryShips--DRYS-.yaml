- en: Last week I [expressed my surprise](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/10/portfolio-a1-jumps-5-in-week.html)
    that the portfolio had decided to sell out its position in [DryShips (DRYS)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=drys&hl=en)
    after the stock registered a 27% gain in just four weeks in the portfolio.  In
    retrospect, my skepticism looks warranted, as DRYS logged an 8.9% gain last week,
    while the stock it was replaced with, [Shanda Interactive (SNDA)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=snda&hl=en),
    was only able to add 0.3% during the week.  That differential, which meant a net
    of about 1.7% to Portfolio A1 last week, accounts for all of the 1.4% lost relative
    to the benchmark S&P 500 index last week.

    and decided to add [DryShips (DRYS)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=drys&hl=en)
    once again, while dropping the one other stock that has had two round trips in
    the portfolio: [Terex (TEX)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=tex&hl=en).'

    [next iteration](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/08/portfolio-a1-looks-to-ag-to-stop.html)
    of my public portfolio in the background and am readying for a January 1, 2008
    launch.  One of the most important changes is that this portfolio will *not* be
    a 100% mechanical system.  It will be partly discretionary, so that I will be
    able to make decisions along the lines of overriding a sell signal in DRYS, if
    I don’t think it is appropriate.
