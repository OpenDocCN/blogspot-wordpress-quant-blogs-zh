## Open source and the flow of information

### July 25, 2008

Toli of [Marketcetera](http://blog.marketcetera.com/) makes an [interesting point](http://blog.marketcetera.com/2008/07/18/myths-about-open-source/) about open source trading system – that the openness of the code base means that end users can make changes without having to show them to anyone else, whether vendors or peers. If you’re developing proprietary trading features, that’s a telling point.

But I think Toli’s point doesn’t quite give us the whole story. How does an end user of an open source system get to the point where they can successfully hack the code ?  Quite often they’ll have to ask questions on a mailing list of peer developers. In the case of Marketcetera those peer developers will be Marketcetera’s own team as well as developers at buy side firms and dealers. Asking questions will reveal information to competing firms…
