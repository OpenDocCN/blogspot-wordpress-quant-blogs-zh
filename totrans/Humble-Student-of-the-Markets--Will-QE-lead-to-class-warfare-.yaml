    that cannot be produced. Land, art, rare wines and Super Bowl tickets are being
    bid up to unthinkable levels. The major economic pastime that remains to differentiate
    the rich from the rest of us is picking new stuff to throw into the fray. The
    latest one is scholar stones from the Sung Dynasty. All that money has to go somewhere.
    But that only leads to a transfer of income from one well-to-do pocket to another
    without generating any production. Sadly for those grounded in the middle class,
    this means more of these things are moving out of reach. But no matter. It all
    seems silly and abstract to most of us, like the amusing eccentricities of the
    English upper class a century or two before.

    appreciation. As some Chinese manufacturers (in the tradable goods sector) lose
    competitiveness because of the rising renminbi, others (in the capital intensive
    sector) will regain it because of even lower financing costs. Jobs lost in one
    sector will be balanced with jobs gained in the other.

    renminbi will shift income from exporters to households, as it should, but cheaper
    financing costs will shift income from households (who provide most of the country’s
    net savings) to the large companies that have access to bank credit. So China
    won’t really rebalance, because this requires a real and permanent increase in
    the household share of GDP. Instead what will happen is that it will reduce Chinese
    overdependence on exports and increase China’s even greater overdependence on
    investment.

    affect systemic risk through a number of channels.First, monetary policy has a
    direct effect on asset prices for the obvious reason that interest rates represent
    the opportunity costs of holding assets. Indeed, an important element of the monetary
    transmission mechanism works through the asset price channel. In theory, an increase
    in asset prices induced by a decline in interest rates should not cause asset
    prices to keep escalating in bubble-like fashion. But if bubbles do develop, perhaps
    because of an onset of excessive optimism, and especially if the bubble is financed
    by debt, the result may be a buildup of systemic risk. Second, recent research
    has identified possible linkages between monetary policy and leverage among financial
    intermediaries.  ***It is conceivable that accommodative monetary policy could
    provide tinder for a buildup of leverage and excessive risk-taking in the financial
    system***.

    of course, needed a loan, but more than that, each needed to make big changes
    so that the loan could really work. Almost always, countries in crisis need to
    learn to live within their means after a period of excess—exports must be increased,
    and imports cut—and the goal is to do this without the most horrible of recessions.
    Naturally, the fund’s economists spend time figuring out the policies—budget,
    money supply, and the like—that make sense in this context. Yet the economic solution
    is seldom very hard to work out...
