    from what I have seen from the data from Jeff Miller and Ed Yardeni, the US is
    experiencing positive earnings estimate revisions, not negative. The discrepancy
    is likely explained by a difference in methodology. Rcube is likely analyzing
    either calendar year 2013 or FY2013 earnings estimates, while Miller and Yardeni
    focuses on forward 12 month estimates. If you look at earnings or revenue estimates
    from a single year, rather than forward 12 month, they have a tendency to start
    high and get revised down - and therefore have a downward bias. To illustrate
    my point, here is a recent chart from

    change over time (and I have annotated the first chart with where I believe the
    "neutral" zone for ERR is likely to be). Even with those caveats, the Rcube analysis
    shows that earnings estimates are plunging in emerging markets and Europe, though
    there is no US chart in the blog post. Globally, earnings estimate revisions are
    definitely headed south. The chart below shows a negative divergence between estimate
    revisions and global PMI, which is worrisome:'

    These developments leave my inner investor worried. Right now, the American economy
    is still showing signs of tepid, though no gangbuster, growth. If the rest of
    the world is slowing, can the US de-couple or hold up the global economy?

    have turned negative. The only long leading indicator still positive is Real M2\.
    The Oil price spike and continuing sequestration certainly aren't helping.

    they matter. For now, we continue to see positive breadth powering the major averages
    to new highs, the Dow Jones Transports making new highs, which confirm the Dow
    Jones Industrials' advance and continued leadership by the Consumer Discretionary
    sector indicating that the American consumer is still healthy. So, don't worry,
    be happy!

    that US equities may be nearing an inflection point. The risk-reward picture is
    turning negative and he doesn't want to stick around at the party until the very
    end when the cops raid the place. He reminds my inner trader of that old Wall
    Street adage, "Bulls make money, bears make money, but hogs get slaughtered."
