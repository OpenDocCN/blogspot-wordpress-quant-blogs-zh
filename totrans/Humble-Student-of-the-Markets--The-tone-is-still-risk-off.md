# Humble Student of the Markets: The tone is still risk-off

**Mid-week market update**: I have some good news and bad news. The good news is the performance of the NASDAQ 100,  the market leadership, has stabilized. The relative performance of the NASDAQ 100 against the S&P 500 successfully tested a rising relative trend line, and the relative uptrend is still intact.

The bad news is the NDX rally failed at the 50 day moving average, and the rest of the market is maintaining a risk-off tone.
