    on the VIX just prior to expiration can be a surprisingly low risk volatility
    play.

- en: Normally, selling naked puts is a dangerous strategy because of the risk that
    negative news can overwhelm the underlying, causing it to gap down and create
    a large loss. With the VIX, however, spikes are almost always upward, because
    while threats to equities are relatively easy to identify, it is much more difficult
    to discern when these threats are suddenly extinguished.

    below the recent floor of 27 – selling a naked put on the VIX is a lot less risky
    than selling naked puts on other securities. Risk to the down side is definitely
    limited, yet the limitations are not perfectly mathematically quantifiable.

    The profit and loss chart below outlines what the trade looks like. With yesterday’s
    closing price of 30.81, the trade is profitable if the VIX rises, drifts sideways
    or loses up to 1.61 prior to tomorrow's [special opening quotation](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20SOQ).
    The gain is $80 per contract. The profit and loss chart shows that a loss of $170
    per contract occurs at 27.50\. Assuming 27.00 is a floor in the VIX, then the
    maximum loss is likely to be capped at $220\. While a 12.3% drop in the VIX in
    one day cannot be ruled out, it is obviously not a very likely scenario.
