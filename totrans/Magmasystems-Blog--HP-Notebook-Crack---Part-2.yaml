- en: After calling back again and going through two more levels of the "gatekeepers",
    I was transferred to India and assigned a new case worker, who promptly informed
    me that HP had not yet determined if my laptop fell into the same category as
    the other 200 models of HP laptops that had the hinge crack problems.

    website. I will try to do the repairs myself.

    fan (with no easy access), makes me think that I will never purchase an HP Laptop

    I have had have been built like tanks.
