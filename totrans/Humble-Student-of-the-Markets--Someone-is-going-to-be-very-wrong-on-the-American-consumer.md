# Humble Student of the Markets: Someone is going to be very wrong on the American consumer

High frequency economic releases have generally been coming in a bit on the soft side, but the signs point to a cautiously optimistic outlook for the American consumer. First, there is the improving employment picture. As well, falling gasoline prices should so provide a boost to consumer spending.

As a result, a number of analysts have been bullish on consumer spending.

got somewhat excited over the tick up in

.

As well,

has indicated that the recent disappointing retail sales figures may be attributable to winter weather. The

has also suggested that we are seeing a bout of seasonal softness in the Q1 growth statistics.

Mr. Market doesn't seem to be buying into the consumer revival theme. Here is a chart of the relative performance of consumer discretionary stocks against the SPX, along with a number of key consumer spending related industries. In all cases, relative performance seems to be rolling over and I see broken relative uptrends everywhere.

There is a disconnect here between macro and technical market expectations. Someone is going to be proven very wrong.
