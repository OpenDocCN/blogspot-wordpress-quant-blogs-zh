    When outsiders look at countries like Australia and Canada, they just see a resource-based
    economy. This is an excellent story about the social and economic divide in Australia
    between the mining based economy in the west and the finance and manufacturing
    in the southeast. Here in Canada we have a similar problem with the mining and
    energy economies of BC/Alberta/Saskatchewan/Newfoundland and the population heavy
    manufacturing/finance of southern Ontario and (partly) Quebec.'
