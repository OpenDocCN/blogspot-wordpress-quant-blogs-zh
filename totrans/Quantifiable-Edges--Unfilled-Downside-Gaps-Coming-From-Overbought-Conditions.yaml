    7th and that day’s bar was very similar to similar to Thursday’s. It included
    an unfilled gap down from an overbought condition and a selloff of close to 3%.
    Below is a study that appeared in the January 8th Subscriber Letter that looked
    at similar situations. Note the study does not include the January 7th instance
    which led to further selling.

    further declines on average.
