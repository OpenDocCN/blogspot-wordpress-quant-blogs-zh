## Bloomberg tickers

### February 8, 2007

Noel has had to confront the [irrationality of Bloomberg ticker symbols](http://www.noelwatson.com/blog/PermaLink,guid,7e70794a-bfd6-4a21-a995-bcaaa9d98dd4.aspx). Noel: I feel your pain – you should see what they’ve done with the vanilla IR swap tickers. I believe the ticker symbols are allocated by a group in NY. I suspect they’re operating some fiendish scheme to maximise congnitive dissonance in developers at contributing dealers. I also suspect that Bloomberg tickers may make a good seed for a pseudo random number generator 😉  This is one area where Reuters does it better.
