- en: Almost every day there is another “micro services” article that implies the
    new silver bullet to software architecture will solve all current architecture
    problems.  Its therefore refreshing to [read](http://highscalability.com/blog/2015/10/12/making-the-case-for-building-scalable-stateful-services-in-t.html)
    “Making The Case For Building Scalable Stateful Services In The Modern Era”.  What’s
    also interesting is Caitie McCaffrey “Building Scalable Stateful Services” [presentation](https://speakerdeck.com/caitiem20/building-scalable-stateful-services) due
    to the many patterns discussed – Sticky Sessions, Data Shipping Paradigm, Function
    Shipping Paradigm, Data Locality, CAP, Cluster Membership, Gossip Protocols, Consistent
    Hashing, DHT.  There is also a nice mention of Microsofts Orleans runtime and
    programming model based on the Actor model (blogged about a long time ago) which,
    if your a Java developer, should hopefully lead you to the [Akka](http://akka.io/)
    toolkit and runtime for some home study.  Time to embrace the Actor model?
