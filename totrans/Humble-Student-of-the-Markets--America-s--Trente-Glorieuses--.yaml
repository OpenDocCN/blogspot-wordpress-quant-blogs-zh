    own demographic dividend, driven by the combination of a rising working age population
    as the children of the post-war Baby Boomers grow up and enter the work force
    and immigration.

- en: The American age demographic profile is substantially better than its major
    trading partners. Despite the angst over dependency ratios, or the ratio of workers
    to retirees, the expected increase in American workers means that American dependency
    ratios are likely to stabilize in the decades to come, whereas those of many other
    countries continue to decline – which will strain the pension system and national
    finances.

    of its higher birthrate, it is also a function if its willingness to accept immigration.
    The United States and Canada are in the minority of major industrialized countries
    that openly accept immigrants.

    mines has become a national issue. But a similar lack of people power is plaguing
    the ambitious but underdeveloped secondary cities of Ontario, and in Atlantic
    Canada a third of the population will be over 65 in less than two decades. The
    Conference Board of Canada estimates that over the next 10 years, there will be
    a million jobs going wanting across the country. This shortage is a drag on Canada's
    potential to innovate and compete into the future.
