    comfortable enough as it is. I don’t need it. Finance should be a footnote in
    my bio, not a central component. Why should I waste time in finance when my influence
    as an intellectual is so high?”

    percent in both 2009 and 2010\. I'm skeptical that represents his average investor
    loss, as opposed to some cherry-picked account, and I'll write a check for $1000
    to a charity of Taleb/Spitznagel's choice if that's true (just send the audited
    consolidated returns for Universa). Allowing random people to spout data like
    that allows funds to intimate performance without taking responsibility for such
    statements, highlighting another regulation that is worse than nothing (by law
    hedge funds aren't allowed to mention their record in general media, but if you
    say something and they don't comment, who's to say?).
