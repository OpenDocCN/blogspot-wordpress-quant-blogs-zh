    head of the TARP oversight committee, and he's looking a lot better than those
    currently proposing radical transformations of our economy. I listened to MIT

    if we knew that there are lots of interesting solutions. But, he gives himself
    a good margin for error, estimating the plan will cost $1.5 Trillion. The other
    part of his plan is cultural, ridding us of the kulaks--oops, 'oligarchs'--by
    capping their pay, and replacing them with public servants. Nothing like a 2000
    word article to instigate a $1.5 Trillion dollar project. I wonder what that

    18 months as an investment banker)? Jamie Gorelick (made $40MM at Fannie, appropriate
    for a former Clinton Attorney General)? These were government officials and representative
    of the types of people who are useful to corporations. They are even more dangerous
    because their connections make them valuable precisely because all they do is
    navigate regulations and government oversight, granting their firms special status
    relative to those who compete on the merits. We need fewer of these people, more
    unsympathetic Wall Streeters who everyone knows is selfish and greedy. The last
    thing we need are bankers who do the 'public good', because saddling these institutions
    with this vague objective gives rise to all sorts of payoffs under the guise of
    helping the poor, as it merely makes sure the SEIU, African-Americans, women,
    the handicapped, and transgendered Native Americans--to mention only a few--are
    treated fairly. The do-gooders usually end up pocketing more for themselves than
    anyone; at least a businessman is honest about his selfishness (United Way and
    CRA blather excepted).

    turnaround specialist, though they do have experience spending trillions of dollars.
    They are filled with government do-gooders who, paradoxically, are painted as
    part of a capitalist conspiracy by leftists (funny because the only IMF and World
    Bankers I have known are staunch Democrats). Chief economists are generally people
    paid to do PR. They don't get their hands dirty actually banking, instead they
    talk a lot about 'important' things like the money multiplier, the Phillips curve,
    and how the latest durable goods report is

    the market alone. If a bank goes bankrupt, let the bankruptcy courts handle it.
    At least, try my plan for all banks west of Philadelphia, and in five years we
    can do an evaluation.
