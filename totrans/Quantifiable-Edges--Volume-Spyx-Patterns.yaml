    rose. This is in contrast to other recent rallies where the Spyx fell as the market
    rose. This is potentially a good sign. Let’s look at the volume Spyx pattern in
    detail to see why it may be a positive. Then I’ll offer my thoughts at this time
    and also compare it to standard volume patterns. (Those not familiar with Volume
    Spyx may

    1-10 days based on this pattern – especially day 1\. The average day over the

    and bearish period from 6/1/07 to now. Over this time there have only been 4 instances
    and results were split. As challenging as the current market is I’m not prepared
    to view the results in a clearly bullish light. I do think it’s better than seeing
    either of the alternatives though.

    as when using the Spyx. In fact it’s about equal with the long-term drift of the
    market, which suggests no significant edge.
