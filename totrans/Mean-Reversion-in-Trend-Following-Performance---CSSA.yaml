    I showed that the momentum factor has been mean-reverting in the short-term, and
    that this effect can be used to trade both the factor and momentum strategies
    effectively. An obvious extension is to see whether trend-following as a factor
    is also mean-reverting. After all, time-series momentum and momentum have been
    shown to be related in the research.

- en: 'To represent the trend-following factor I used the data for the BarclayHedge
    SG Trend-Following Index which captures the profitability of CTAs that follow
    a systematic trend-following approach. For consistency, I used the same methodology
    as the original post: I took the 10-day return and smoothed using a 5-period simple
    moving average in order to reduce noise. I then took the percentile ranking using
    all history available at each point-in-time of that smoothed return. Oversold
    was considered to be when the percentile ranking of the return was below the median
    (<.5) and overbought was when the percentile ranking was above the median (>.5).
    Positions are held until the percentile ranking goes back above (below) the median.
    As a third strategy, I tested avoiding the top quartile of performance (<.75)
    which is a lower turnover and perhaps a more realistic strategy.'

- en: In general we see evidence of mean-reversion in trend-following performance
    (this is true using a wide variety of parameters) which becomes most pronounced
    starting in early 2014\. The strategy of avoiding the top quartile (long when
    trend-following has not recently been performing very well) has been effective
    over longer periods of time.

- en: '**The lesson highlighted in recent posts has been that to be effective in the
    modern day environment you have to be a contrarian**— buying momentum and trend-following
    strategies after they have had poor performance. The reason this anomaly likely
    exists is because people tend to hire and fire managers based on recent performance.
    As a piece of anectdotal evidence: when I was doing consulting work a long time
    ago, I used to joke with my colleagues that certain clients were particularly
    adept at timing when to be in or out of strategies: as soon as they were upset,
    the strategy probably bottomed, and as soon as they wanted to increase their allocation
    it had probably topped. After making several poor allocation/timing decisions
    they usually quit the strategy altogether claiming that it was ineffective.'

    performance using a sample of over a hundred different strategies (including both
    mean-reversion and trend-following as well as many others). My experience in money
    management after 2010 has been no different. Unfortunately, all marketing is geared
    toward recent performance so there is a conflict of interest: if you understand
    that strategies mean-revert in the short-term then you will be marketing most
    when clients are least likely to make money. AUM flows tend to reflect that this
    method works well. It is therefore not surprising that [DALBAR studies](https://www.dalbar.com/)
    show that the average investor (most of whom have advisors) significantly underperform
    their risk benchmarks.'
