    after reading a book? Arguing from authority (Freakonomics modestly notes that
    Levitt is "the most brilliant young economist in America"), it seems like Levitt
    is demolishing a staid and blinded establishment, yet to the extent his points
    are truly important and novel, they are untrue (e.g., abortion and crime), and
    to the extent they are true and novel, they are unimportant (e.g., sumo wrestlers
    engage in quid pro quos when on the bubble in tournaments). As Rubinstein points
    out, the book makes points, but not really, points particular to economics:'

    that requires the use of common sense. Take, for example, Levitt’s tales of the
    big city. The Chicago Municipality administers an annual test for schoolchildren.
    A suspicion arose that teachers were “correcting” their students’ answers before
    sending the tests to be checked. Levitt obtained the data from the municipality
    and developed a computer program that looks for classes with suspicious combinations
    of answers. For example, if all of the tudents in a particular class responded
    correctly to questions 7, 8 and 10, and erred on question 9, a suspicion arises
    that the teacher falsified the answers to four questions. (On question 9, the
    teacher either made a mistake himself or tried unsuccessfully to avoid raising
    suspicion.) In this way, Levitt discovered dozens of deceitful teachers. The IDF’s
    intelligence units and credit card companies use similar algorithms. What have
    we learned about Levitt? He is a smart guy

    them on finding evil-doers. These agencies have hundreds of thousands of employees,
    and in a bureaucracy, a disproportionate number of inside-the-box thinkers. That
    they might pay for a speech by an outsider is rather unremarkable, as I'm sure
    the list of such speakers is long and boring. It's hardly an exclusive group (though,
    truth be told, the CIA has not asked me for my opinion--player hater!). So, I'm
    no fan. Of all the Freakonomics-like books, I think Freakonomics is the worst.

    a book publisher is like a dog trying to learn calculus. If you have a new idea,
    like, say, Freakonomics the original, he'd probably suggest self publishing.
