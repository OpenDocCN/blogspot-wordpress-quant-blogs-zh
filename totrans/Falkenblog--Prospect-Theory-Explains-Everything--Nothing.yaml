    either overweighted quite grossly or neglected altogether, making the decision
    weights highly unstable in that region.[page 8, [Choices, Values and Frames](http://www.amazon.com/Choices-Values-Frames-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0521627494/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1237846939&sr=1-1)]

    a disaster happens that seems to cause a lot of angst, one can say it was underweighted.
    If someone is paying a lot for insurance that seems to generate a positive return,
    one can say people are overestimating this risk. Ex post, the theory explains
    everything, and nothing. Looking a small probability event before the fact, it
    predicts everything, and nothing.
