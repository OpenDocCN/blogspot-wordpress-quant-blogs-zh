- en: Earlier in the summer I did a POC integration of [SpreadServe](http://spreadserve.com)
    with [TransFICC](http://transficc.com). For those unfamiliar, TransFICC has an
    ex-[LMAX](https://etrading.wordpress.com/disruptor/) founding team, and is a new
    entrant in the ECN gateway space. Technically their key differentiators are cloud
    hosting and high performance engineering techniques. For Transficc clients the
    only thing running on premises is the Java API, which puts the same orthogonalised
    interface on all the usual fixed income ECNs, and connects to the cloud hosted
    gateway processes.

    surprised by how improved the Java ecosystem has become. [Gradle](http://gradle.org)
    has transformed dependency and package management. And the single threaded async
    approach popular in the Python and C++ worlds has finally made it to Java with
    [Netty](https://netty.io). You can find the code [on GitHub here](https://github.com/SpreadServe/TFWebSock).
