- en: Last week I talked a little about the PCVXO, which combines put to call ratios
    and volatility data in one sentiment indicator.  In crunching numbers on the original
    PCVXO system and a number of variants, I have concluded that the PCVXO family
    can be an effective market timing device.  For those who may be wondering whether
    they should invest some time and energy in an effort to better understand of the
    PCVXO, I can offer my encouragement, along with a couple of tidbits from my research.

    I described some of the [trading rules](http://www.optionetics.com/market/articles/15221)
    advocated by Jay Kaeppel, the developer of the PCVXO.  Kaeppel recommends initiating
    positions when the PCVXO re-crosses the 110 and 90 levels, in order to catch the
    remaining portion of the mean-reverting move.  While various backtesting methods
    indicate that this does produce good results for both long and short positions,
    it is possible to miss a large portion of the mean-reverting move if the PCVXO
    happens to spike above 120 or even 130, as was the case with some PCVXO family
    systems following the February 27^(th) spike in volatility.  For this reason,
    I recommend timing entries to coincide with the first drop or second consecutive
    drop in the PCVXO once it crosses the 110 threshold.  This approach will result
    in an earlier entry and a better chance of catching a larger portion of the big
    mean-reversion waves.  A similar strategy is also effective below the 90 level,
    but because extreme low readings in the PCVXO tend to be much milder than extreme
    high readings, the incremental gains from this strategy are much smaller.

    an opportunity to evaluate what happens when the put to call and volatility data
    diverge.  In a nutshell, my findings are that high readings of volatility relative
    to put to call data are generally bullish for the broad markets while high readings
    of put to call data relative to volatility are generally bearish for the broad
    markets.  This is not what I would have expected, which makes the data even more
    interesting…and raises quite a few additional questions.

    divergence in the put to call and volatility data as recently as last week.  Given
    that it was low put to call numbers that contributed to the divergence, this should
    be a bullish sign for the markets.
