- en: Last week I talked a little about the PCVXO, which combines put to call ratios
    and volatility data in one sentiment indicator.  In crunching numbers on the original
    PCVXO system and a number of variants, I have concluded that the PCVXO family
    can be an effective market timing device.  For those who may be wondering whether
    they should invest some time and energy in an effort to better understand of the
    PCVXO, I can offer my encouragement, along with a couple of tidbits from my research.

  zh: 上周我稍微提到了PCVXO，这是一个将看涨期权和看跌期权以及波动率数据结合在一起的单一情绪指标。在研究原始PCVXO系统和许多变体时，我得出结论PCVXO家族可以是一个有效的市场时机构。对于那些可能想知道是否应该投入时间和精力更好地理解PCVXO的人，我可以提供我的鼓励，以及我的研究中的几项小发现。
- en: In a [previous post](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/05/pcvxo-combining-put-to-call-ratios-and.html),
    I described some of the [trading rules](http://www.optionetics.com/market/articles/15221)
    advocated by Jay Kaeppel, the developer of the PCVXO.  Kaeppel recommends initiating
    positions when the PCVXO re-crosses the 110 and 90 levels, in order to catch the
    remaining portion of the mean-reverting move.  While various backtesting methods
    indicate that this does produce good results for both long and short positions,
    it is possible to miss a large portion of the mean-reverting move if the PCVXO
    happens to spike above 120 or even 130, as was the case with some PCVXO family
    systems following the February 27^(th) spike in volatility.  For this reason,
    I recommend timing entries to coincide with the first drop or second consecutive
    drop in the PCVXO once it crosses the 110 threshold.  This approach will result
    in an earlier entry and a better chance of catching a larger portion of the big
    mean-reversion waves.  A similar strategy is also effective below the 90 level,
    but because extreme low readings in the PCVXO tend to be much milder than extreme
    high readings, the incremental gains from this strategy are much smaller.

  zh: 在[上一篇文章](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/05/pcvxo-combining-put-to-call-ratios-and.html)中，我介绍了一些由Jay
    Kaeppel提出的[交易规则](http://www.optionetics.com/market/articles/15221)，他是PCVXO的开发者。Kaeppel建议当PCVXO重新穿越110和90的水平时建立头寸，以抓住均值回归剩余的部分。虽然各种回测方法表明这对多头和空头都能产生良好的结果，但如果PCVXO不幸地激增到120甚至130以上，就可能会错过均值回归的大部分行情，正如2月27日波动率激增后一些PCVXO家族系统所经历的那样。因此，我建议在PCVXO穿越110阈值后的第一次或第二次连续下跌时进入市场。这种方法将导致更早的进入，并有机会捕捉更大一部分的均值回归大行情。在90以下水平采用类似的策略也有效，但由于PCVXO的极端低读数通常比极端高读数要温和得多，因此这种策略带来的增量收益要小得多。
- en: One particularly interesting aspect of PCVXO calculations is that it gives me
    an opportunity to evaluate what happens when the put to call and volatility data
    diverge.  In a nutshell, my findings are that high readings of volatility relative
    to put to call data are generally bullish for the broad markets while high readings
    of put to call data relative to volatility are generally bearish for the broad
    markets.  This is not what I would have expected, which makes the data even more
    interesting…and raises quite a few additional questions.

  zh: PCVXO计算的一个特别有趣方面是，它给了我一个评估看涨期权和看跌期权以及波动率数据偏离时会发生什么的机会。简而言之，我的发现是，相对于看涨期权，波动率的较高读数通常对大盘市场有利，而相对于波动率，看涨期权的较高读数通常对大盘市场不利。这不是我原本预期的结果，这使得数据更加有趣…并引发了许多额外的问题。
- en: Finally, in light of the above, it seems worth noting that there was a significant
    divergence in the put to call and volatility data as recently as last week.  Given
    that it was low put to call numbers that contributed to the divergence, this should
    be a bullish sign for the markets.

  zh: 最后，鉴于上述情况，值得注意的是，就在上周，看涨期权和波动率数据出现了显著偏离。由于是低看涨期权数字导致了这种偏离，这应该是对市场有利的牛市信号。
