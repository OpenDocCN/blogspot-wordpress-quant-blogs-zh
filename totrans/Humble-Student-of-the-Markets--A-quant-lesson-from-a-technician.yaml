- en: When talking about the difference between trend following and mean reverters,
    DeGraaf says that trend following works. Mean reversion is extremely difficult
    for career longevity. With respect to indicators, you can’t look at the whole
    picture as one environment. Because it’s not one environment, you have uptrends
    and downtrends, bull markets and bear markets. So DeGraaf uses a quantitative
    model to define which “regime” the market is in within a trend – bull or bear
    trend. Then based on which regime we’re in, he adjusts how he uses certain indicators.
    He says that making these adjustments depending on uptrend and downtrends improves
    results. Ned Davis likes to use the relative strength in Financials as an indicator
    for the US Stock Market. DeGraaf actually said that he feels the relative strength
    in the Industrial sector is even more important than the Financials relative strength.
    I thought that was interesting. DeGraaf also talked about how not every indicator
    needs to give buy and sell signals. A lot of the indicators we look at can simply
    help to add and remove conviction which helps with position sizing and hedging
    strategies. That was an awesome point that I rarely hear mentioned. A good indicator
    he likes is the IPO Index vs the S&P500 to get a food feel fro the underlying
    credit environment.

    to hear the hot stories and jump on them. Classic mean reversion is contrarian
    and value investing. That's why value can be difficult from a personal psychology
    viewpoint. True contrarianism is hard and often you are alone in your beliefs.

- en: During the course of my career, I have seen many quantitative analysts try to
    make a model for all seasons. Most failures occur because of regime shifts. When
    DeGraaf talks about changes in environment, he refers to market direction, but
    there are other kinds of regime shifts that happen that affect the way alpha is
    generated.

    It wasn`t just growth investing, because momentum stocks had zero or negative
    earnings so growth factors did not fully capture the performance effect. In effect,
    the more junky the concept stock, the more it went up.

    a recession. When that happens, the shares of the nearly bankrupt companies that
    made it through the downturn rocket upwards. In the 1982 bottom, shares of Chrysler
    bottomed at 1 7-8 and rose to over 30 about a year later. In the 1990 bear market,
    shares of Magna International, the auto parts manufacturer, bottomed  below 2
    and then shot up to over 80\. I dubbed it the

    market was low stock price as the lowest decile of stock price beat the top decile
    by some astounding amount (I don`t have the exact figure but I recall it was in
    the order of 80%). It was a factor that I will bet no quantitative analyst had
    in his factor set.

    managers who focus on well run companies with good cash flows and good business
    underperform badly. Were the markets irrational or stupid, or was it a regime
    shift that the manager missed?

    When I joined Batterymarch in the early 1990`s, it was difficult for an investment
    manager to become a quant. You could buy subscriptions to some of the databases,
    but the task of integrating databases, e.g. fundamental Compustat data, with their
    quarterly and annual data series, weekly IBES estimate data, and daily price data,
    as well as resolving company identifiers with stock ticker identifiers, since
    some companies had dual class shares, was a gargantuan task. You had to have an
    entire IT and data team to scrub and manage the databases and put them into a
    usable format. During the 10 year tenure at Batterymarch, we went through at least
    three different research platforms - just imagine the development costs!

    like Google and Yahoo.

    If the barriers to entry have fallen so far and you are all looking at the same
    data, where is the alpha going to come from?'
  prefs: []

    to bottom-up stock picking techniques. You have to be able to recognize the regime
    shifts and deploy the right combination of models out of your toolkit accordingly.
