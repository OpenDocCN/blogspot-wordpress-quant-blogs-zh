# Calculation Example Spreadsheet and Different Strategy Backtests for the DV Stochastic

September 14, 2009

Hi all,  Corey Rittenhouse of Catallactic Analysis has been kind enough to test out some strategy variations on the DV Stochastic using the S&P500.  The combo strategy is very interesting. I forwarded him an example spreadsheet for the exact calculation of the indicator to post on his site.
