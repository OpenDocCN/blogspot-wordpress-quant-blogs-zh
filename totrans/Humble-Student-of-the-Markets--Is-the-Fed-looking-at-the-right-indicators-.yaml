    households and businesses and do not signal any change in the outlook for the
    economy or for monetary policy, which remains about as it was at the January meeting
    of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). At that meeting, the Committee left
    its target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and said it anticipates
    that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the
    federal funds rate for an extended period.

    to move off-balance-sheet “structured investment vehicles,” “trust preferred assets”
    and other beasts onto their balance sheet, ***which is expected to result in some
    sharp hits to bank capital***. In response, regulators such as the FDIC will most
    probably be called upon to look the other way for a while.

    as “a black hole that regulatory rules had ignored in assessing how much capital
    the banks needed to hold. The beauty of those securities was that they were really
    debt that the holding companies could call capital. Having that “capital” meant
    the bank could take on more debt. A system that lets a bank borrow more money
    because it has already borrowed money – rather than because it has sold stock
    – is hardly a wise one.”
