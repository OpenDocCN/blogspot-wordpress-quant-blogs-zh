# Humble Student of the Markets: Will Biden reset the Sino-American relationship?

As the clock ticks down on Trump's days in the White House, and Biden election has been confirmed by the Electoral College, it's time to ask if a Biden Administration will reset the Sino-American relationship. The key questions to ask are:

*   What does each side want, and what are the sources of friction?
*   What constraints is China operating under?
*   What's the likely path forward?

While my main focus is on trade, that's not the only dimension of friction between the two countries. China's newly assertive foreign policy and brinksmanship in the South China Sea is also a source of concern for geopolitical stability.
