    It can sometimes help to compare it to similar moves in the past. The table below
    is one I last showed in the 2/2/2009 blog. It looks at  all the times the SPY
    gapped down at least 2% to start the day. The column on the right shows how long
    it took for SPY to close above its gap down open (up to a week). Today I’ve also
    added some red arrows. These mark the other times the gap down occurred following
    a close above the 200ma.  As you'll note, a 2% gap in an uptrend is quite unusual.

    to do. Two events I looked at last night were the 1995 Kobe earthquake in Japan
    and the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster in the Ukraine. While their local markets
    were hurt badly, neither event caused much reaction in the U.S. They were essentially
    3-5 day pullbacks totaling between 2% and 3.5% in the SPX.
