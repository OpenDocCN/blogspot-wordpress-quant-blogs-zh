- en: Once a popular subject in this space, the [VIX:VXV ratio](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%3AVXV)
    appeared to be a casualty of the financial turmoil and record volatility spikes
    in October 2008, when the ratio spiked to record levels an generated a buy signal
    that turned out to be nothing short of a disaster.

- en: I was not yet ready to give up on the VIX:VXV ratio, so I was pleased to see
    that from November to January it generated some helpful long and short signals.
    In a promising development, on March 2^(nd) the ratio generated a buy signal just
    before the markets bottomed. When the VIX:VXV ratio urged caution in June, I had
    even more reason to be hopeful. Then, once again, the ratio had another big miss,
    issuing a sell signal in mid-July just after the markets started rallying. To
    compound matters, instead of moving back toward the neutral zone (between 0.92
    and 1.08), the ratio persisted with a bearish recommendation all the way to the
    October top.

    Always Consistent” bin, but decided to reconsider when I started thinking about
    volatility levels in the context of [availability bias](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/availability%20bias)
    and [disaster imprinting](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/disaster%20imprinting),
    as well as [The Gap Between the VIX and Realized Volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/08/gap-between-vix-and-realized-volatility.html)
    and [VIX Spike and VIX Futures Contango Means…](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/10/vix-spike-and-futures-contango-means.html)
    As I see it, all these subjects are related. The [realized volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/realized%20volatility)
    gap, persistent VIX futures [contango](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/contango)
    and off-center VIX:VXV ratio (see chart below) are all symptoms of a market that
    is not functioning as it normally does, while availability bias and disaster imprinting
    are the main causes of this situation.

- en: Further, the fact that the VIX futures term structure is now flat and the VIX:VXV
    ratio hit a new post-March 6^(th) high of 1.056 last Friday suggests that the
    volatility picture may be starting to assume some of its pre-Lehman characteristics
    – if not exactly returning to a ‘normal’ state of affairs.

- en: Personally, I still think the VIX is a little higher now than realized volatility
    will be a month from now, but a high VIX relative to realized volatility may turn
    out to be one of the more persistent effects of the global financial crisis, as
    each investor has their own personal half-life for how long availability bias
    and disaster imprinting will cast a shadow on their view of the investment landscape.
