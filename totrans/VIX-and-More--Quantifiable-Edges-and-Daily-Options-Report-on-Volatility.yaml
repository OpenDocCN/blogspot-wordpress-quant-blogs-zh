- en: Rob Hanna at [Quantifiable Edges](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/) has
    a post up in which he looks at short-term volatility cycles. In [What Happens
    After a Sharp Contraction in Volatility](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2009/07/what-happens-after-sharp-contraction-in.html),
    Rob reviews three day periods of extremely low realized volatility and concludes
    that three day cycles of extremely low volatility are typically followed by three
    subsequent days of dramatically increasing volatility, in classic [mean reversion](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/mean%20reversion)
    fashion.

- en: Adam Warner at [Daily Options Report](http://adamsoptions.blogspot.com/) covers
    several volatility-related issues in [Other VIX Gappage](http://adamsoptions.blogspot.com/2009/07/other-vix-gappage.html),
    where he discusses gaps in the VIX and his preference for using [VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX)
    over VIX to better gauge volatility trends on Fridays.
