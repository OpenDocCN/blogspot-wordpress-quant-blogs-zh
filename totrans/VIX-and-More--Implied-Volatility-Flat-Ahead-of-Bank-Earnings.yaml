- en: With some very important earnings in the financial sector coming up this week
    ([JPM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/JPM) on Wednesday; [C](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/C)
    and [GS](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/GS) on Thursday; [BAC](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/BAC)
    and [GE](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/GE) on Friday), I have been
    watching [implied volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/implied%20volatility)
    (IV) in the sector very closely. Much to my surprise, implied volatility has not
    increased ahead of earnings, as is typically the case.

    of price and volatility activity in JPMorgan Chase (JPM), with the upper portion
    chart highlighting the last two earnings releases with the blue “E” icon. The
    bottom half of the chart plots 30-day implied volatility (red line) against 30-day
    historical volatility (light blue line) during the same period.

- en: Note that just prior to the last two earnings reports, implied volatility rose
    due to the uncertainty and potential for higher volatility associated with an
    earnings surprise. This time around, however, the lack of movement in implied
    volatility – as well as the proximity of the IV level to historical volatility
    – suggests that investors are not expecting any surprises at all. In fact, this
    situation is not specific to JPMorgan, but is also mirrored at Citigroup, Bank
    of America, Goldman Sachs and even quasi-financial General Electric. Not surprisingly,
    the bank ETFs, such as [KBE](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/KBE),
    and the financial sector ETF, [XLF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLF),
    show a similar pattern.

    that there will not be any surprises. Investors who think implied volatility is
    underestimating the surprise potential for the banks may look to initiate long
    [straddles](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/straddle) or long [strangles](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/strangle)
    to take advantage of a potential increase in implied volatility – and hence options
    prices.
