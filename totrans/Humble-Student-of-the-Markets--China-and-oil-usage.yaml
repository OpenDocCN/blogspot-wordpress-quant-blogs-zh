- en: '[Center for Geoeconomic Studies](http://blogs.cfr.org/geographics/2010/08/23/chinasoilconsumption/)
    showed this chart of crude oil usage intensity of China and other countries in
    a blog posting: Their comment was that China is rapidly approaching the $15,000
    GDP per capita level when oil consumption intensity starts to rise. Given the
    vastness of Chinese population, this would mean that global oil demand would take
    off like a rocket [emphasis added]: "Were China’s per capita oil consumption to
    be brought up to South Korea’s, ***its share of global consumption would increase
    from today’s 10% to over 70%***." By implication, such a development would be
    incredibly bullish for oil and other energy prices. **Does the new five year plan
    mitigate demand?** Or does it? In some ways, China''s communist based central
    planning approach gives us a better picture of her intentions. In a recent [interview](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/chinas-five-year-plan-marks-transformation-2010-11-11)
    with Caixin, Liu He, a vice minister of the Office of the Central Leading Group
    on Financial and Economic Affairs, expounded on the Chinese government''s latest
    five-year plan: In other words, China''s aim in the latest five year plan is to
    move from low value-added production up to higher value added production, both
    for domestic consumption and export. Romer calls it growth based on creativity,
    i.e. more design. Michael Porter would call it moving up the value-chain. In the
    past, China''s insatiable demand for natural resources has been the result in
    some silly projects, e.g. inefficient steel plants. This mis-allocation of capital
    has gobbled up a lot of natural resources such as iron, copper, coal, oil, etc.
    A transformation of the economy that is more oriented to higher value-added and
    more creative design oriented output is likely to dampen some of the oil and other
    raw material intensity nature of the Chinese economy. **Long-term bullish or bearish
    for energy?** Does this mean that crude oil demand intensity is not poised to
    skyrocket as per the Center for Geoeconomic Study chart above? On the bullish
    side, we have seen this same level of rising affluence drive up energy demand
    in other countries. On the bearish side, the Chinese government seems to be at
    some level working to restrain energy and other natural resource intensity of
    their economy. Don''t forget the transformation in the American economy in the
    1980''s, when prolonged oil prices resulted in more efficient use of energy, e.g.
    smaller cars, etc., and oil demand dropped as a result. I am still leaning bullish
    on the case for rising oil demand. However, there are risks to this story and
    the bearish case shouldn''t be ignored. ***Addendum***: Further to my post, I
    see that the latest IEA report concludes that [oil demand would peak in 2020 if
    CO2 is cut aggressively](http://www.thenational.ae/business/energy/oil-demand-peak-by-2020-if-co2-is-cut-aggressively)
    (also see story [here](http://www.neurope.eu/articles/IEA-urges-action-on-climate-change/103657.php)).
    While it is unlikely that individual countries would adhere to global accords
    on CO2 emissions, it does show that efforts to cut consumption, such as [fossil
    fuel subsidy reductions](http://www.economist.com/blogs/newsbook/2010/11/fossil-fuel_subsidies),
    can have a significant impact on demand.'

    the economic growth model means increasing efficiency, which involves Paul M.
    Romer’s New Growth theory, which is to improve total factor productivity and the
    knowledge content of growth. Transforming the economic growth model is really
    improving the efficiency of supply.
