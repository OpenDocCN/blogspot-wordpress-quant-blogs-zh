- en: A lot of outrage over $450MM in bonuses, but with 115,000 employees, that's
    only about 4k per employee. Some are contractual payouts from revenues, such as
    commissions. I don't see how you can stop this.

- en: Now, for those managing people who generate revenues, or managing people who
    manage people, I agree that these people's bonuses might be inappropriate. But
    if your base salary is $100k plus x% of commissions, I don't that's excessive
    or problematic.
