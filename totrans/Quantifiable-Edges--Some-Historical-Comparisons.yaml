- en: I ran a study that looked at market performance following two 3.5% up days in
    the S&P 500 within 10 trading days. Results following this type of occurrence
    were quite bullish over the next 2-6 weeks. There were also some major bottoms
    identified. Below is a copy of the results table I displayed that day (therefore
    it doesn’t include the March 19th, 2008 occurrence). $100,000 per trade.

    has been associated with intermediate or long-term bottoms. There was probably
    a fair amount of short covering today. There was also probably a fair amount of
    short covering in October 1987 and October 2002.
