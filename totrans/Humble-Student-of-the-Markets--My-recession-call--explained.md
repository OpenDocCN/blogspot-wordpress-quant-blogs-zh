# Humble Student of the Markets: My recession call, explained

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2020/03/my-recession-call-explained.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2020/03/my-recession-call-explained.html#0001-01-01)

In the past week, I have had several discussions with investors about my recession call (see

[OK, I'm calling it](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2020/03/09/ok-im-calling-it/)

). Since the publication of that note, Bloomberg Economics' US recession probability estimate spiked recently up to 55%.

The odds of a 2020 recession at betting sites are even higher.

To reiterate, I would like to clarify the reasoning behind my recession call, which is based on a triple threat:

*   The emergence of COVID-19 in China has created a supply shock that disrupted supply chains all over the world.
*   The Saudi-Russia oil price war, which has devastated the oil patch in the US.
*   The COVID-19 pandemic, which is expected to result in both a supply shock and demand shock in the US.
