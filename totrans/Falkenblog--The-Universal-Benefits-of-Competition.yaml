    is competition: government often rules out competition by law, or subsidizes production
    in such a way that alternatives are not truly competing. Yet firms that compete
    for customers minimize costs, maximize efficiencies, and innovate, much more than
    governmental organizations.'

    'Cleaner fish' get rid of parasites on 'client fish.' The cleaner gets to eat
    the parasites, the client fish likes having fewer parasites. Sometimes, however,
    the cleaner fish take a bite out of client fish for some extra protein, and this
    hurts the client fish.

- en: When client fish have a large territory, they have a choice of cleaner fish,
    and choose the cleaner fish that don’t bite as much. Client fish watch the fish
    in front of them getting cleaned (they often approach the cleaner fish in a queue).
    If the client fish being cleaned is jumping around in front of them, they know
    there is a lot of biting going on.

    in general, is. We are nicer, better, less short-sighted, when we have to compete.
    Insulate yourself from the market, and you can easily rationalize biting your
    customers.
