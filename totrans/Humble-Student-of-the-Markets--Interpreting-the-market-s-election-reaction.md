**Mid-week market update**: It's always instructive to see how the market reacts to the news. If I had told you that the dual market nightmare scenarios of a contested election and a deadlocked election consisting of a Biden Presidency and a Republican-controlled Senate were to come true, would you expect the market to take a risk-on or risk-off tone?

As well, the Republicans have retained control of the Senate, which puts the idea of a Blue Wave sweep to rest. That said, the presidential election is very close and subject to challenge. The likelihood of a contested election that winds up in the courts, and the streets, is high.

In the face of all this uncertainty, the S&P 500 melted up to regain its 50 dma.
