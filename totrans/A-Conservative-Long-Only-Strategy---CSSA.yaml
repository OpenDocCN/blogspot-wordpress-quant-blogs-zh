- en: 'In the test below, we used two DV Indicators that were longer-term: the **DVI**
    which is an intermediate smooth momentum oscillator and the **DVDS** or Super-Smoothed
    Double-Stochastic as it is otherwise known. The goal was to create a simple and
    fairly low-risk/low maintenance long only strategy. We used a rising/falling 200sma
    as a trend filter. We bought when the DVDS was less than 20 indicating a near
    cycle bottom, and DVI was below .5 –indicating intermediate oversold conditions.
    The position was sold when DVI rose above .5 or if the 200sma started to fall
    to protect against having to be stuck in a long trade. The results below are pretty
    good and exposure is very low and do not include the yield on T-bills (which would
    improve the results). The maximum drawdown is very acceptable, and the percentage
    of winners are high enough to stick with the strategy. There are many ways to
    increase the gains per trade as well as returns without increasing risk–but I
    will leave that up to creative researchers to figure out.'
