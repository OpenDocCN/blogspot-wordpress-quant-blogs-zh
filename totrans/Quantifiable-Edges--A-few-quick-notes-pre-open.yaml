    2/17, 2/27, and 3/5\. (I personally did not consider the 2/17 one valid because
    it came after a US holiday when the foreign markets were open for 2 days.) In
    every case the market continued lower that day, unlike many in the study. Also,
    the 3/5 instance was the only one of the 3 that managed a higher close in the
    next few days. I still consider a 2% gap open to have a short-term bullish influence,
    though. The 2/27 instance is really only the 2nd true maverick, along with 10/6/2008,
    among the bunch.
