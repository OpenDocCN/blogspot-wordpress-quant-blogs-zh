    to outperform over the next 3-18 months, with an optimal point being around 12
    months. The above graph is the total return for going long the past winners, short
    the losers. Historically this strategy has generated a puzzle, because the annualized
    return of around 8% it is pretty high, and it seems independent of the standard
    value and growth risk proxies. Sometimes it is added as a risk factor to studies,
    but mainly because we know it works and don't want to confuse this finding as
    something else. There is not a good 'risk' explanation for it.

    stocks that had been pounded like banks roared back (the momentum portfolio would
    have been short those). From March 2009 through September 2009 the momentum strategy
    lost about 50% and has gone up only about 5% since. Since 1932 (when it lost 77%),
    its worst draw-down was consistently about 30%, so the standard financial fat
    tail event happened. If you are lucky when such strategies stop working they flat-line,
    but this one was not so fortunate. As they say about these statistical patterns:
    they work until they don''t.'

    came out the tumultuous 2007-8 period relatively unscathed. Unless momentum starts
    to really outperform it will go the way of 'low price' stock funds, because a
    big -50% really hurts all those lifetime annual return statistics.

    have positive alpha. So, we put it on in the fourth quarter, and it started out
    ok, so ramped up in December. Of course, December 2003 was really bad for this
    strategy. Without a long track record, I looked like an idiot. I felt horrible
    and remember writing Ken French an email, and asking, what can I tell my boss
    about momentum's lousing December 2003? He was nice enough to reply, though all
    he said was, 'tell him there's risk'. Alas, that was not a good answer. In real
    time when you lose money it isn't seen as risk that pulled a bad number from the
    urn of chance, but a bone-headed mistake, especially when you don't have a benchmark.
    That wasn't one of my better Christmases.

  zh: 我记得在2003年，我说服老板尝试动量策略，因为它似乎有正的阿尔法。于是，我们在第四季度开始使用，并且一开始还不错，所以在12月加大了投入。当然，2003年12月对这种策略来说真的很糟糕。由于没有长期的跟踪记录，我显得很蠢。我感觉很糟糕，记得给肯·弗伦奇发了封邮件，问他，我能告诉老板关于2003年12月动量策略的糟糕表现吗？他还比较友好地回复了，虽然他只是说“告诉他那是风险”。唉，那不是一个好答案。在实时交易中如果你赔钱了，人们不会认为是风险导致了坏的结果，而是因为犯了一个愚蠢的错误，尤其是当你没有一个基准参照。那不是我最好的圣诞节之一。
