## Learning JavaScript

### August 13, 2008

So since I’m [building with Caplin](https://etrading.wordpress.com/2008/07/08/building-with-caplin/), I’m learning JavaScript for Caplin Trader based UI implementation. I’ve been a Python coder since 2000, so I’ve long made the shift from C++/Java/C# style static type checking to dynamic type checking and a syntax that is free of type declarations. Which is a big shift in coding mind set. For me the big difference in JavaScript is [prototype based inheritance](http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Guide:Inheritance).

Another major difference is debugging. If you run your JavaScript in IE, you can debug in Visual Studio. If you favour Firefox, then [Firebug](http://getfirebug.com/) is the way to go. Getting the IE/VisualStudio debugging proved too much of a struggle for me, so I’ve settled on Firefox 2.0.0.16 with Firebug 1.0.5, which seems to be working well for me.
