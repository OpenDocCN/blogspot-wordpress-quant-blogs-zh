    of Fear or Volatility Lately](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/11/not-lot-of-fear-or-volatility-lately.html),
    I cautioned, “despite what you read elsewhere, not all market bottoms require
    a high volume capitulation session, with an accompanying VIX spike.”'

    since I''m more interested (generally) in the VIX than in SPX volume, I looked
    at the VIX and SPX on a weekly basis going back to 1990, which is as far back
    as VIX data goes, and here is my thinking:'

- en: A) Classic capitulation (VIX spikes at least 2x above previous levels and volume
    surges) bottoms appear in Aug-Dec 1991, Mar 1994, Aug 1998, Sept 2001, and July
    2002\. More recent instances include May-Jul 2006, Feb-Mar 2007, and Aug 2007.

- en: B) Bottoms that lack a significant VIX spike (in the area of 2x above previous
    levels) include Jul-Sept 1996, Mar 1997, Mar 2001, and Sept-Oct 2002\. More recent
    examples include Mar-Aug 2004 (one bottom or three mini-bottoms), Aug 2005, and
    October 2005\. I am not ruling out the current [November 27, 2007] environment
    as another one of these 'uneventful bottoms.'

    else. I'd be tempted to argue that the only major bottoms we've had since the
    VIX data begins are 1990 and 2002 -- so the bottoms above are necessarily more
    of the intermediate and long-term variety.*

    can!”  As a matter of fact, I expect the current downtrend will likely end without
    the VIX spiking even close to twice the recent levels.*'
