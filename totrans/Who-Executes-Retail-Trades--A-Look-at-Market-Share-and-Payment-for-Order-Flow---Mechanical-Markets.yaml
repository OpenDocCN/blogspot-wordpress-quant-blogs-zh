    resting limit orders that are likely to have come from a human. There are all
    kinds of human traders, but probably the most coveted counterparties are retail
    traders. So coveted, in fact, that wholesalers will pay to interact with them
    and exchanges will pay to get them into their order books.

    The most readily available source is probably SEC 606 reports. 606 reports are
    generally in a non-standardized format, lack important details, and appear even
    at a glance to have significant data quality issues. Nonetheless we will try to
    glean from them what we can. I’ve undertaken the tedious task of converting the
    unformatted reports, by hand, into something machine readable. I hope the results
    make the effort worthwhile.

    most large brokers would have the money, brand, or shared business interests to
    be advertised on Nasdaq’s [website](http://www.nasdaq.com/investing/online-brokers/).
    I picked all of the “Online Broker Partners,” except LOYAL3 because I couldn’t
    immediately find a 606 report from them. The aggregated 606 reports from Q4 2014

- en: One of the very first things we see is the higher payments brokers tend to receive
    for non-marketable orders. This shouldn’t be too surprising, since a broker has
    an incentive to post non-marketable limit orders on exchanges with high liquidity-provider
    rebates, which they receive upon execution. Could brokers get their clients a
    higher fill rate by posting these orders on exchanges with no rebate? Maybe. It’s
    well known that orders executed on inverted exchanges tend to perform better after
    trading, by roughly the amount of the rebate difference (we saw this in an earlier
    [post](https://mechanicalmarkets.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/toa-exchangesummary-13661.png)).
    Retail orders may be a bit different though; we shouldn’t ignore the possibility
    that resting retail orders are almost destined to lose a penny upon trading. Should
    a client mind if their broker managed to capture a third of that through a rebate
    instead of feeding all of it to whoever else is trading? Maybe clients should
    get a commission discount for sending a resting order instead of a marketable
    one? I can see why brokers might shy away from that kind of pricing transparency.
    Some [brokers](https://www.robinhood.com/) already offer commission-free trading;
    going any further down this road would mean clients actually getting paid to trade.
    At a certain point, brokers might invite [uncomfortable comparisons](https://mechanicalmarkets.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/casino_rebate.png).

- en: I don’t really know how best to make payments for order flow transparent. Maybe
    in the distant future there will be some sort of auction process where even non-marketable
    retail orders can receive price improvement. In the meantime we have to ask whether
    a broker seeking to pocket a large rebate might sacrifice their customer’s desire
    to get filled. I find it a bit unlikely since the broker won’t get paid at all
    if the customer isn’t executed. Ultimately, even with the seemingly perverse system
    of payment for order flow, brokers and clients probably have similar interests
    when it comes to resting orders.
  prefs: []

- en: We can see that resting orders are generally directed to major exchanges. Nyse,
    EdgeX, Nasdaq, and Arca make up about 90% of their volume. These exchanges are
    highly active and I’d expect that they get customers filled without increasing
    adverse selection by more than their roughly 0.30 cent rebates. I was a bit surprised
    to see so much volume directed to Nyse, because some exchanges, particularly EdgeX,
    offer much higher rebates for retail orders (see “[Retail Order Tier](http://www.batsglobalmarkets.com/us/equities/membership/fee_schedule/edgx/)“).
    Interactive Brokers was the only broker directing signficant volume to Nyse and
    their fee [schedule](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=commission&p=stocks2#america)
    indicates that at least some of their clients receive part of the liquidity-provider
    rebate. Maybe because they don’t receive some of it, Interactive Brokers cares
    less about squeezing the maximum rebate out of client orders (that, or their revenues
    from rebates are more complex due to the partial pass-through and presence of
    exchange tiers).

    much experience with Lava, and it would depend a lot on the specific stocks in
    question, but Lava’s volume during this time would have been an order of magnitude
    lower than these other exchanges. That could mean orders resting on it did receive
    noticeably lower fill rates than expected. Hopefully, brokers directed orders
    to that exchange only when it showed significant activity on the relevant stock.
    In any case, if there was an issue with Lava, there isn’t one any longer; Lava
    has been [shut down](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/02/us-citigroup-lavaflow-idUSKCN0JG1R520141202).

    For the other brokers, UBS appears to be mainly a destination for marketable orders.
    But Schwab had a [contract](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/02/us-retailbrokers-paymentfororderflow-ins-idUSBRE9310M120130402)
    with UBS during this period and appears to have sent UBS passive orders as well.
    Could some of these orders have found their way to Nasdaq, marked with UBS’s MPID?
    It seems like a definite possibility, given that we [saw](https://mechanicalmarkets.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/toa-mpid-ubss-1366.png)
    that orders marked UBSS performed as expected for retail orders (poorly), were
    larger than most non-retail orders, and numbered about 10,000 executions per day
    (Schwab as a whole executes hundreds of thousands of trades per day). I wonder
    if UBS might have kept the rebates from these orders, which were probably worth
    about 10-15k/day.

- en: This brings us to the question of whether Schwab has extracted maximal value
    out of their customers’ orders. They were only getting about 0.10 cents per share
    from UBS during this period. Some brokers managed to get more than that from marketable
    orders alone – for instance, TD Ameritrade, which apparently received 0.18-0.19
    cents/share from each of Citadel, G1, Two Sigma, and UBS itself. Adding some non-marketable
    orders into the mix like Schwab presumably has should only make that rebate higher,
    suggesting that maybe Schwab did not negotiate as hard as Ameritrade with UBS.
    Or, perhaps, that Schwab demanded better execution prices and faster fills than
    Ameritrade. If indeed Ameritrade’s higher received payments came at the expense
    of customers’ executions, it raises an interesting question about whether that
    expense can be argued as being baked in to their commissions, or if disgruntled
    customers could claim that Ameritrade is violating the spirit of [best execution
    requirements](http://www.sec.gov/answers/bestex.htm). Although it sounds similar
    to a broker pocketing the rebate on non-marketable orders, this would not be identical
    to what we discussed above; the executed prices of retail marketable orders are
    to some extent chosen by their counterparty. Executing clients at a worse price
    somehow feels different to me than getting them a slightly lower fill rate, but
    still at their chosen price. It seems to me that payment for marketable order
    flow may entail greater legal risk for brokers when they knowingly accept higher
    payments than their competitors (but I’m far from an expert on such things).

    article by John McCrank. Evidently, Fidelity’s retail orders may first interact
    with institutional flow (possibly Fidelity clients as well), reducing the economic
    value of any orders left over. I don’t know if and how any orders internalized
    by Fidelity itself would appear on their report. One potential sign in Fidelity’s
    606 report is that a bit more than 1% of their flow is executed at a sister company,
    National Financial Services. It’s conceivable Schwab is doing something similar
    and the real reason they receive smaller payments is that they send UBS less attractive
    order flow. Or it’s conceivable that Ameritrade charges more for order flow and
    gets worse prices for their customers.

    million in the year-ago quarter. This reflects a $198.9 million decrease in trading
    gains from the year-ago quarter. Removing the effects of currency translation,
    the market making segment produced $21.2 million pretax income in this quarter,
    compared to $41.3 million for the same period last year. Currency translation
    losses were $133.0 million this quarter, compared to a $46.2 million gain in the
    year-ago quarter. The decrease in market making profits, excluding translation
    effects, can be attributed to the ongoing competitive environment, lower volatility
    as measured by the CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX® and a trading error that resulted
    in a loss of approximately $16 million.
