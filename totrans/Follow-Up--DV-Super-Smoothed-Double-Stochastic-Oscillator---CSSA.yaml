- en: I am an ETF rewind subscriber and came across your highly informative web site.
    Somewhere on your site (i forget where), you mentioned that you can share the
    calculation or code for some of the indicators, including DV Sto oscillator, that
    you’ve created. I’d like to get them into tradestation and test them with some
    of the strategies i’ve created. Thanks very much in advance, Ray
