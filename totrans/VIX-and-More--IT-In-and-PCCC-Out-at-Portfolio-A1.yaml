- en: As I suspected might happen [last week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/03/portfolio-a1-update-for-31107.html),
    PCCC’s performance lag has finally caught up with it and it will be dropped from
    the portfolio tomorrow and repaced by IT, otherwise known as Gartner, the research
    powerhouse that has been on a tear as of late, up almost 200% since April 2005.  IT
    made a new 52 week high on Thursday, the [31st new 52 week high](http://quote.barchart.com/quote.asp?sym=it&code=BSTK)
    in the last year.  IT has also raised guidance three times in the past nine months
    and announced a $200 million share buyback just last month.

    has also become the top performer in the portfolio, up 6.9%.
