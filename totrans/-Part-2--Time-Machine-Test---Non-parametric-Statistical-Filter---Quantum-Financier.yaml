    of every of the 50 strategies the algorithm can choose from. As you may know,
    the Student’s t-distribution used to estimate the mean of a *normally distributed
    population.* Such an assumption on the distribution contradicts the kind of fat
    tail returns the market throws at us. To relax the normality assumption, one can
    use a non-parametric statistical test. Non-parametric statistics make fewer assumptions
    regarding the distribution of the underlying and therefore can be more robust,
    thus making a prime choice for the “Time Machine” algorithm. More reading on Wilcoxon
    signed-rank test can be found here: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilcoxon_signed-rank_test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilcoxon_signed-rank_test).'

    t-test to establish the significance of strategies. The results below are for
    the strategy using a 95% significance filter on the S&P 500.

    to see that the maximum drawdown is smaller when using the Wilcoxon test. This
    is probably caused by the increased robustness of the statistical test. For the
    time being I will keep testing the algorithm on different equity indices and asset
    class stay tuned.
