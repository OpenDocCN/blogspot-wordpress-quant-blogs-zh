    issues related to [Greece](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Greece)
    and the [PIIGS](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/PIIGS) ([Portugal](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Portugal),
    Italy, Ireland, Greece and [Spain](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Spain)),
    it is not surprising that the [euro](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/euro)
    has come under so much selling pressure as of late.

- en: Considering that the dollar index is comprised of a weighted basket of foreign
    [currencies](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/currencies) of which
    the euro comprises 57.6%, it is not too much of a stretch to think of the dollar
    as an inverse euro – as their almost mirror image in the chart below suggests.
    So given that recent weakness in the euro is accounting for most of the dollar’s
    resurgence and the dollar has a strong influence on the prices of commodities
    and stocks, it is meaningful to consider how the fluctuations in the euro have
    translated into changes in stocks and commodities.

- en: This week’s [chart of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week)
    looks at ETFs for the euro ([FXE](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/FXE)),
    dollar ([UUP](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/UUP)), stocks ([SPY](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SPY))
    and commodities ([RJI](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/RJI)) for the
    last 15 months. Following the bottom of the stock market in March 2009, the euro
    (red line) rallied in concert with the S&P 500 index (blue line) and commodities
    (green line) through December 2009\. As the euro began to weaken, however, both
    stocks and commodities initially continued their bullish climb, before selling
    off in January and the beginning of February. Since the early February lows, stocks
    (SPY) have managed to rally in spite of a weakening euro and firming dollar (purple
    line). Commodities, which tend to react more strongly to currency fluctuations,
    have struggled much more with euro weakness and dollar strength. Should the euro
    continue to fall, it is reasonable to expect stocks to continue to outperform
    commodities and of course euro weakness to directly lift the dollar to new heights.
