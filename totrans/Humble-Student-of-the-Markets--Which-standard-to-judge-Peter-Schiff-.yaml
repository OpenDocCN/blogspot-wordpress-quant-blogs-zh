    that it is useful to explore the framework that investors should judge his record,
    or anyone else's record for that matter.

    of what to buy and sell. Brokerage analysts do that every day. In addition, there
    are various services that try to emulate the buys and sells of other investors

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Given our natural intense focus on selection, it is natural to judge an investment
    advisor on the quality of his picks and opinions. By that standard, his opinions
    weren’t too bad. He did call the economy's decline correctly and

    play.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is a second much tougher standard to judge Schiff – as a portfolio manager.
    A portfolio manager is held to not just the first step of the investment process
    (what to buy and sell) but on all parts of the process based on his overall performance.
    By that standard, Schiff failed dismally. As I understand it, he overstayed his
    welcome in the commodity and emerging market trade and performance suffered as
    a result.

    portfolio were stopped out in the decline. That is why I don’t represent this
    blog as investment advice. I know nothing about your preferences. I don’t always
    tell you when to sell, because I don’t know your risk appetite. I don’t tell you
    how much to buy and sell. If you really wanted all of the above you would be paying
    me and we would have a real business relationship.)
