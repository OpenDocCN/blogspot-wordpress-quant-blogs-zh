    is more likely to reverse hard than go to zero then you’re probably in the minority.
    You may also find the following charts interesting. They’re 5-minute charts of
    the legendary reversal bottoms. Whether you’re long, short, or sidelined you may
    want to study them for a few minutes – in case it doesn’t drop to 0.

- en: One common theme I see is that once the bottom was established the uptrend stayed
    in tact. October 10th 2002 saw a brief and relatively minor break of price support
    just before noon. Other than that all the rallies held their ground throughout
    the day. In other words, if you're trading intraday, a loose trailing stop may
    not be a bad idea. A sharp break of support seems unlikely if the market is going
    to put in it's next legendary reversal.
