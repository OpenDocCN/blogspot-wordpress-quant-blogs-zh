# Humble Student of the Markets: Q2 earnings season = Market abyss?

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2022/06/q2-earnings-season-market-abyss.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2022/06/q2-earnings-season-market-abyss.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models** 

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post, 

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The 

**Trend Asset Allocation Model**

 is an asset allocation model that applies trend following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity prices. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. The performance and full details of a model portfolio based on the out-of-sample signals of the Trend Model can be found

[here](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/trend-model-report-card/)

.

My inner trader uses a 

**trading model**

, which is a blend of price momentum (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa). Subscribers receive real-time alerts of model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of the email alerts is updated weekly

. The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that began in March 2016 is shown below.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Sell equities*
*   Trend Model signal: Bearish*
*   Trading model: Neutral*

** The performance chart and model readings have been delayed by a week out of respect to our paying subscribers.***Update schedule**

: I generally update model readings on my 

[site](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/)

 on weekends and tweet mid-week observations at @humblestudent. Subscribers receive real-time alerts of trading model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of those email alerts is shown

**Nagging doubts**

Despite my constructive views on the direction of the stock market, some nagging doubts remain. Even as top-down strategist reduce their S&P 500 EPS estimates, bottom-up estimates, as measured by forward 12-month EPS, have been rising steadily for both large and small caps.

As we approach Q2 earnings season, the risk of a flood of negative guidance that pushes down consensus estimates is high, which would spark a risk-off episode.
