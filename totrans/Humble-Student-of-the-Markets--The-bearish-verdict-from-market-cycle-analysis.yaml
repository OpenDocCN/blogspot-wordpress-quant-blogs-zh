    find that they start to get capacity constrained. They respond by hiring more
    people, which leads to a virtuous cycle of more consumer spending, and buy more
    capital equipment. During this part of the market cycle, Consumer Discretionary,
    capital equipment sensitive sectors like Technology and Industrial stocks lead
    the market higher.

    this is an idealized cycle which ends with either an inventory recession or the

    very slowly.

    analysis. A market cycle behaves like an economic cycle, but it only describes
    the market response to expectations, not the actual economic result. As an example,
    the economic cycle started at the trough of the Lehman Crisis in 2008-09, but
    I believe that the market cycle actually began in late 2011, when the markets
    got over the trauma of the debt ceiling impasse in Washington and the ECB acted
    to relieve the pressures of the eurozone crisis with its LTRO program.

    Any home sale is usually part of a series of interdependent transactions. The
    newlyweds who buy a starter home are usually doing so from a married couple, who
    have a 3-year-old and another on the way. They want to buy a larger home with
    more bedrooms for the kids, and purchase that from the couple who are trading
    up to a nicer home in a better school district. Those sellers purchase their new
    home on more land, or with a better view or some other factor. The long chain
    of buyers and sellers, beginning with the first-time buyers, explains why household
    formation is so crucial.
