    process, or at least something similar, a good degree of time is spent understanding
    the data, and linking different data sets together to create the appropriate data
    frames (H2OFrame etc) before you can start train models and tuning the model parameter.
     A Semantic Data Lake should at least reduce the identification of data linkages
    time

    rather than ETL.  However, with changing resources on your Data Science team,
    there is a degree of “learning” time about the data.  RDF’s and ontologies should
    reduce this.
