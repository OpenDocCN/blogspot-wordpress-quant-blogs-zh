    (the gross characteristics of price movement) and pricing function (a view on
    expected forward price) is important.

- en: In particular, with market making, there will be periods in the market where
    market making is “dangerous” (i.e. is almost guaranteed to lose money).   Aside
    from the obvious danger in gapping prices around news or other events, the main
    danger is in offering during periods of strong momentum.

- en: There will be a strong order selection bias such that when the market is going
    up (down) you receive buying (selling) orderflow almost exclusively, and end up
    with short inventory against an appreciating (depreciating) price.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hence, there will be periods during a trading day that are “good” for market
    making (i.e. when there is balanced order flow and very gradual price drift) and
    periods which are better suited for momentum or high-amplitude cycle following
    strategies.

    period, as well as an estimate of noise and MR activity. This information is invaluable
    in determining appropriate market making offering prices and in following high
    amplitude price activity.

- en: In the context of market making we are looking to have a monotonic and almost
    linear price function that represents a mean or a mode through price noise.  
    Calibrated in this fashion one has a convenient view on the forward price function
    and the upper and lower bounds on prices we are willing to offer on.   This combined
    with inventory can be used to dynamically bias the offerings.

- en: In the context of momentum or cycling we are looking for a pricing function
    that follows the momentum or cycles with appropriate curvature and is reasonably
    predictive (or retrospective with low-lag) with respect to pivot points.

    a SDE in a bayesian framework, as is more elegant and flexible.    My past experience
    with EKFs was that they are hard to parameterize (via the state and measurement
    covariances) and can easily become unstable in the presence of unexpected noise.'
