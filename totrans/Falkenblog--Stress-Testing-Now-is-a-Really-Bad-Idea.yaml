    risk scenario that is sufficiently extreme to constitute a tail event. Arguably,
    designing such a scenario is better delegated to the authorities than to individual
    firms, in part because they ought to be more immune to disaster myopia. In its
    Financial Stability Report (FSR), the Bank describes such stress scenarios.

  zh: 首先，设置压力测试场景。这里的关键要素是设计一个多因素风险场景，足够极端，以构成尾事件。可以说，设计这样的场景最好由当局委托而不是由个别公司来执行，部分原因是他们应该更能免于灾难性近视。在其金融稳定报告（FSR）中，银行描述了这样的压力测试场景。
- en: What is this stress test in the FSR, I wonder? I check it out online, and see
    that it seems to merely extrapolate losses on mortgages and corporate bonds. Now,
    with mortgages one can estimate based on the recent past, but with all of the
    mortgage proposals out there, this is all a huge guess, because they have the
    potential to make the current situation much worse via giving mortgage holders
    the incentive to default and then apply for federal aid. After all, a $1000 bounty
    is being proposed for such restructurings, in which case a new wave of mortgage
    defaults will occur as people rush to fit into the Feds new guidelines for restructuring.
    As to the corporate default rate extrapolations, there aren't any good aggregate
    corporate default rate models. I was at Moody's, and the model is pretty bad,
    merely because you really do not have a lot of data, and its basically like business
    cycle forecasting, which has thus far failed to anticipate every major economic
    event since Moses (not that they are stupid, it's a hard problem). Speculative
    default rates peaked in 1970, 1990, and 2002 at around 9%, so I would simply stick
    with that (it was 15% in 1933, however), though this is not mentioned in the report
    so I don't know what they are using. As per the investment grade default rate,
    those peak around 0.4% since the Great Depression. But is not clear the potential
    stress test would differentiate between speculative and investment grade loans.
    A distinction with a difference, one of many in this issue.

  zh: FSR中的这种压力测试是什么，我很好奇？我在网上查了一下，发现这似乎只是在推测抵押贷款和公司债券的损失。现在，关于抵押贷款，可以基于最近的过去估计出来，但是有了所有这些抵押贷款提案，这只是一个巨大的猜测，因为它们可能通过给予抵押贷款持有者违约的激励，然后申请联邦援助，从而使得目前的情况变得更糟。毕竟，对于这样的重组，提议给出了1000美元的赏金，这种情况下，人们会涌入联邦新的重组指导方针中，新一波的抵押贷款违约将发生。至于公司违约率的推算，没有任何良好的总体公司违约率模型。我去过穆迪，它的模型非常糟糕，主要是因为你真的没有很多数据，基本上像是商业周期预测一样，迄今为止未能预测出自摩西以来的每一次重大经济事件（并不是说他们愚蠢，这是一个难题）。投机性违约率在1970年、1990年和2002年分别达到约9％的峰值，所以我会简单地坚持这一点（但1933年达到了15％），虽然这在报告中没有提到，所以我不知道他们在使用什么。至于投资级别违约率，自大萧条以来峰值约为0.4％。但是潜在的压力测试是否能区分投机性和投资级别的贷款尚不清楚。这是一个重要区别，这个问题中的众多之一。
- en: But this is a small part of many bank's portfolios. At KeyCorp, where I was
    head of capital allocations, most of our exposure was to consumer credit, and
    non-rated corporate debt, and the fluctuations there were milder, historically.
    What stress will you apply there? If they apply the speculative or mortgage default
    stress to these books, I imagine most banks are insolvent, but what does that
    prove? If a sector of the financial system is experiencing the one in 100 year
    flood, do you then assume every sector has the same 1 in 100 year flood simultaneously?
    Haldane does not specify this important issue. And many thought the invasion of
    Iraq was poorly planned.

    is pretty straightforward. It is not. Any quick, nationwide stress test will be
    arbitrary. Regulators do not have a lot of experiencing assessing economic risk
    capital to 'good' assets. Historically, they merely check leverage ratios (tier
    1, tier 2, total), and then make sure various level of bad loans are in their
    proper buckets (OAEM, Substandard, Doubtful, Loss).

  zh: 关于压力测试的细节没有给出。我推测他认为“压力测试”是相当简单的。不是这样的。任何快速的全国性压力测试都将是武断的。监管者在评估经济风险资本对“良好”资产的经验不多。从历史上看，他们只是检查杠杆比率（第一层、第二层、总额），然后确保各种程度的不良贷款处于适当的桶里（有经济利益的不良贷款、次级不良贷款、存疑不良贷款、损失）。

    disaster looming (that picture is from his own homepage, I guess it's his cheeriest
    photo). He forecasts disaster perpetually from an infinite number of sources,
    and his mechanism hardly relied on the mortgage sector ex ante, so I think it's
    safe to say he is just a broken permabear clock who now has the correct time.
    Andrew Haldane, in his speech, critiques the financial community for missing the
    crisis, but since 2005, he headed the Bank of England's Systemic Risk Assessment
    work, responsible for the Bank’s new quantitative risk assessment framework and
    its six-monthly Financial Stability Report. I do not see why he exempts himself
    from this failure, or why he feels confident that an instant bank decimation scheme
    based on his trenchant understanding of the financial sector is better than simply
    leaving the patient alone.

    Haldane），在他的讲话中，批评金融界错过了这场危机，但自2005年以来，他一直负责英格兰银行的系统性风险评估工作，负责银行的新定量风险评估框架及其半年一次的金融稳定报告。我不明白他为什么要豁免自己的失败，或者为什么他觉得基于他对金融领域的尖锐理解的即时银行破产方案比简单地让患者自生自灭更好。
