    was because people are afraid of Geithner's potential stress test. Today, I read
    two eminent people calling for stress testing. First, Andrew G Haldane, Executive
    Director of Financial Stability at the Bank of England. As Haldane

    risk scenario that is sufficiently extreme to constitute a tail event. Arguably,
    designing such a scenario is better delegated to the authorities than to individual
    firms, in part because they ought to be more immune to disaster myopia. In its
    Financial Stability Report (FSR), the Bank describes such stress scenarios.

- en: What is this stress test in the FSR, I wonder? I check it out online, and see
    that it seems to merely extrapolate losses on mortgages and corporate bonds. Now,
    with mortgages one can estimate based on the recent past, but with all of the
    mortgage proposals out there, this is all a huge guess, because they have the
    potential to make the current situation much worse via giving mortgage holders
    the incentive to default and then apply for federal aid. After all, a $1000 bounty
    is being proposed for such restructurings, in which case a new wave of mortgage
    defaults will occur as people rush to fit into the Feds new guidelines for restructuring.
    As to the corporate default rate extrapolations, there aren't any good aggregate
    corporate default rate models. I was at Moody's, and the model is pretty bad,
    merely because you really do not have a lot of data, and its basically like business
    cycle forecasting, which has thus far failed to anticipate every major economic
    event since Moses (not that they are stupid, it's a hard problem). Speculative
    default rates peaked in 1970, 1990, and 2002 at around 9%, so I would simply stick
    with that (it was 15% in 1933, however), though this is not mentioned in the report
    so I don't know what they are using. As per the investment grade default rate,
    those peak around 0.4% since the Great Depression. But is not clear the potential
    stress test would differentiate between speculative and investment grade loans.
    A distinction with a difference, one of many in this issue.

    head of capital allocations, most of our exposure was to consumer credit, and
    non-rated corporate debt, and the fluctuations there were milder, historically.
    What stress will you apply there? If they apply the speculative or mortgage default
    stress to these books, I imagine most banks are insolvent, but what does that
    prove? If a sector of the financial system is experiencing the one in 100 year
    flood, do you then assume every sector has the same 1 in 100 year flood simultaneously?
    Haldane does not specify this important issue. And many thought the invasion of
    Iraq was poorly planned.

    Geithner's stress test would be helpful here. The government should start with
    the big banks that have outside debt, and it should determine which are solvent
    and which aren't in one fell swoop, to avoid panic.

    is pretty straightforward. It is not. Any quick, nationwide stress test will be
    arbitrary. Regulators do not have a lot of experiencing assessing economic risk
    capital to 'good' assets. Historically, they merely check leverage ratios (tier
    1, tier 2, total), and then make sure various level of bad loans are in their
    proper buckets (OAEM, Substandard, Doubtful, Loss).

    of high quality assets, because it treats BB rated bonds like AAA rated bonds,
    and even with the recent surprises, one should not assume every liability has
    the same probability of going into default. A stress test should apply the stress
    based on their historical loss rates, looking at the institution and industry-wide
    data, but that would generate a large amount of differentiation and complexity,
    and this would generate a lot of haggling over important, real, differences of
    opinion, and sheer politics as some use legitimate issues as cover for naked opportunism.
    It is inherently complicated, and even though we would like a solution quickly,
    it is counterproductive to attempt a quick solution in this situation.

    I would take my chances with contagion vs. randomly culling the herd via some
    poorly thought-out stress test.

    disaster looming (that picture is from his own homepage, I guess it's his cheeriest
    photo). He forecasts disaster perpetually from an infinite number of sources,
    and his mechanism hardly relied on the mortgage sector ex ante, so I think it's
    safe to say he is just a broken permabear clock who now has the correct time.
    Andrew Haldane, in his speech, critiques the financial community for missing the
    crisis, but since 2005, he headed the Bank of England's Systemic Risk Assessment
    work, responsible for the Bank’s new quantitative risk assessment framework and
    its six-monthly Financial Stability Report. I do not see why he exempts himself
    from this failure, or why he feels confident that an instant bank decimation scheme
    based on his trenchant understanding of the financial sector is better than simply
    leaving the patient alone.

    these schemes is at least on that level. Just remember, no matter how bad things
    are, they can always get worse, and when dealing the the collapse of complex systems
    no one fully understands, attempting a quick fix is almost certainly going to
    make things worse.
