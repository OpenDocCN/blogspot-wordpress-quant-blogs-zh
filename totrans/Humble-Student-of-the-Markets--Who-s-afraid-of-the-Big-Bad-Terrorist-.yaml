    on fundamentals. Aside from the tragedy of injury and loss of lives, market participants
    should be asking what impact a terrorist attack would have on the growth outlook
    and interest rates. In most cases, the answer is "not very much."

    José María Aznar's PP was defeated. Immediately after the bombing, leaders of
    the PP claimed evidence indicating the Basque separatist organization, ETA (Euskadi
    Ta Askatasuna) was responsible for the bombings, while Islamist responsibility
    would have had the opposite effect as it would have been seen as a consequence
    of the PP government taking Spain into the Iraq War, a policy extremely unpopular
    with Spaniards.

    view among political analysts is that the Aznar administration lost the general
    elections as a result of the handling and representation of the terrorist attacks,
    rather than because of the bombings per se.
