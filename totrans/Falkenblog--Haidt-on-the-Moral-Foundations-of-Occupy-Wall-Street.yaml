    I saw at OWS was that the rich (“the 1 percent”) got rich by taking without giving.
    They cheated and exploited their way to the top. As if that wasn’t bad enough,
    we the taxpayers then had to bail them out after they crashed the economy, and
    so now they really owe us for saving their necks. It’s high time that they started
    giving back, paying what they owe.

    suggests that protesters there are also chiefly concerned with fairness. The key
    to understanding Tea Partiers' morality, though, is that they want to restore
    the law of karma. They want laziness and cheating to be punished, and they see
    liberalism and liberal government as an assault on that project. The liberal fairness
    of OWS diverges from conservative and libertarian fairness in that liberals often
    think that equality of outcomes is evidence of fairness.

    unequal ability is primarily from effort, discipline, and finding one's niche,
    believe in markets; those who think the market is generally a rigged game that
    rewards vice, that people are basically equal and become unequal mainly through
    forces beyond their control, believe in greater government control. Equality of
    outcomes is justice in one case, injustice in the other. Given these different
    assumptions are responsible for the most pressing political disagreements we have,
    and these are rather factual statements, the nice thing is that someday there
    may be more agreement on politics.
