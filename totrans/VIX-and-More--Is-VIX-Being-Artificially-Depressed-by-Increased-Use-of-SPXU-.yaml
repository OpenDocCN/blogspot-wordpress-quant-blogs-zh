    by surprise, including this writer.

- en: If one were to study last Friday’s [Forces Acting on the VIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/07/forces-acting-on-vix.html),
    it would not take long to determine that with very few exceptions, the fear and
    uncertainty associated with the forces in the graphic have been rapidly diminishing
    over the course of the past few months.

- en: One of the forces that I mentioned has received very little attention and has
    likely been underestimated by traders – if accounted for at all. This is the growth
    of hedging substitutes for the SPX. As the VIX is strongly influenced by the demand
    for SPX puts, it stands to reason that any substitutes for SPX puts could ‘artificially’
    lower VIX levels by diverting demand to alternative hedging products. Historically,
    these substitutes have included futures, options and various forms of swaps. With
    the increased interest in ETFs and particularly leveraged ETFs, however, the menu
    of substitutes has increased dramatically.

    how many investors were foregoing SPX and SPY puts in favor of options targeted
    specifically on the financial sector.

- en: With the introduction of the bearish -3x Short ProShares ([SPXU](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SPXU)),
    a [triple ETF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/triple%20ETFs) aimed
    at replicating -300% of the daily move in the SPX, I believe traders have found
    – and embraced – an alternative to SPX options that is starting to impact the
    VIX.

- en: The graphic below shows how the recent increased volume in the SPXU just happens
    to coincide with the decoupling of the VIX and the [VXN](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXN).
    The same factors are undoubtedly impacting volatility term structure as well and
    may explain some of the recent low readings in the [VIX:VXV ratio](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%3AVXV).

- en: I am leaving the title of the graphic as a rhetorical question for the moment,
    as one month of data will necessarily leave us far short of any sort of statistical
    proof. Do not be surprised, however, if SPXU and its +3x sibling [UPRO](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/UPRO)
    continue to generate larger interest and volume, both as a hedging tool and as
    a speculative play. As leveraged ETFs based on the SPX increase their market share,
    interest in SPX puts – and absolute levels in the VIX– may see a significant decline.
