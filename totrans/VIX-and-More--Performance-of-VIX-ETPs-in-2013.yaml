- en: A number of readers have asked me to recap the performance of the [VIX ETPs](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20ETN)
    in 2013 according to the leverage/maturity grid I have been publishing for several
    years.

- en: The graphic below should look familiar to long-term readers and measures the
    performance of all VIX and volatility ETPs for 2013, including dividends. (Two
    exceptions are [TRSK](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TRSK) and [SPXH](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SPXH),
    which have data going back to June 24, 2013 and as such, the closing price on
    that date is treated as the opening price for 2013.)  This time around I am going
    to refrain from most editorial comments, yet point out that the data bears a very
    strong resemblance to what I presented in [VIX ETP Performance in 2012](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2013/10/performance-of-vix-etps-during-recent.html). 
    It is also worth noting that just because there were similar numbers in 2012 and
    2013, one should not expect these patterns to repeat on a regular basis. In [Performance
    of VIX ETPs During the Recent Debt Ceiling Crisis](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2013/10/performance-of-vix-etps-during-recent.html),
    for instance, I present a very different set of data that students of volatility
    should also pay close attention to.

    and for additional performance data and commentary, the links below should provide
    an excellent jumping off point.
