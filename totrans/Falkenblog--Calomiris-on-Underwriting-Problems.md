Charles Calomiris taught me Money and Banking in graduate school, and I thought then he was very wise.

> In a painstaking forensic analysis of the sources of increased mortgage risk during the 2000s, "[The Failure of Models that Predict Failure](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1296982)," Uday Rajan of the University of Michigan, Amit Seru of the University of Chicago and Vikrant Vig of London Business School show that more than half of the mortgage losses that occurred in excess of the rosy forecasts of expected loss at the time of mortgage origination reflected the predictable consequences of low-doc and no-doc lending. In other words, if the mortgage-underwriting standards at Fannie and Freddie circa 2003 had remained in place, nothing like the magnitude of the subprime crisis would have occurred.
