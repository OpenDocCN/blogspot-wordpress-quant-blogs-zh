# Humble Student of the Markets: Managing extreme tail-risk market events

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2011/03/managing-extreme-tail-risk-market.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2011/03/managing-extreme-tail-risk-market.html#0001-01-01)

Are you worried about losing money in the market but don't want to miss the rally? That's the conundrum posed by my post

[Thinking bearishly, trading bullishly](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2011/02/thinking-bearishinly-tradingly.html)

. In that post, I outlined my concerns about the market, namely:

*   Chinese slowdown
*   European sovereign risk
*   US municipal bond implosion
*   Further weakness from US real estate

On the other hand, my inner trader was staying bullish in the face of these risks because of bullish technical and sentiment readings. However, I remained highly aware of these extreme tail-risk events which could derail the markets.

CXO Advisory wrote a timely piece entitled

[Overview of Research on Asset Allocation in the Face of Disaster](http://www.cxoadvisory.com/big-ideas/overview-of-research-on-asset-allocation-in-the-face-of-disaster/)

 and they concluded that current asset allocation practices didn't have a clue of what to do in the face of these extreme events:

> [E]vidence from surveys of relevant research indicates that academia has made little progress in finding practical ways for investors to protect even diversified portfolios from extreme events (crashes).

**Market timing: Avoid extreme risk, but allowing winners to run**

Under these kinds of volatile market conditions, allocating some funds into market timing strategies makes sense.

[Abnormal Returns](http://abnormalreturns.com/thursday-screencast-taa-time/#)

also discussed different approaches to market timing, of which the

[Inflation Deflation Timer Model](http://www.qwestfunds.com/publications/newsletters_pdf/newsletter_november_2009.pdf)

is one of the variants.

I know that the term "market timing" is a four-lettered word in some quarters, but given the current environment where extreme tail-events are more likely, buy-and-hold strategies are likely to lead to sub-optimal results.
