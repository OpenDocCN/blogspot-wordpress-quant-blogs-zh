    and SARS. For investors, it has an economic impact. Even before the outbreak,
    world merchandise trade volume had been falling. New data is likely to show that
    the outbreak disrupted global supply chains sufficiently to further depress global
    trade.

    in mid or late February, and they consequently penciled in a V-shaped recovery.
    As China slowly returns to work amidst draconian measures to control the outbreak,
    doubts are rising on whether China's economy could bottom out in Q1\. The authorities
    would have to be satisfied that the worst of the infection is over before giving
    the all-clear for everyone to return to work. An economy as large as China's will
    not be able to restart itself overnight, and the process will take time. In the
    meantime, much damage has been done, both to global supply chains and Chinese
    company balance sheets, and a wave of insolvencies is likely to follow. The only
    question is the magnitude.

    statistics from Johns Hopkins CSSE shows that the growth of covid-19 cases is
    not under control outside China. Equally disturbing is the challenges faced by
    two First World economies, Japan and Singapore, to deal with the outbreak. What
    happens when the infection appears in countries with health care systems that
    are less prepared?

    in Q1, or the economic recovery will be V-shaped.
