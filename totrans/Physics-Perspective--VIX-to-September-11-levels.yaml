    after all -- but Bloom suggests, by analyzing 16 previous episodes of similar
    spikes, that a short recession is very likely, as economic growth generally follows

    Missile Crisis, the Assassination of JFK – and the only certain thing about these
    is they lead to large short-run recessions (Bloom 2009).
