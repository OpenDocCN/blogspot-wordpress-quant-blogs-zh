- en: The number of instances was a little bit low. These results are strongly suggestive
    of upside over the next few days, though. The profit factor (gross gains / gross
    losses) over the first 3 days is especially impressive. Also compelling is the
    fact that every instance saw at least 1 close above the trigger day close within
    the next day or two.
