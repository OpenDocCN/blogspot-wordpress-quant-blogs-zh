    of various intro classes, and engaged in standard late-night discussions that
    are supposedly the essence of a modern liberal education, but really most of my
    learning happened outside my college experience. That is, I learned most of my
    math, statistics, history and computer knowledge before or after college, and
    interpersonal skills outside of the structured social functions of my fraternity
    (AEPi--Sigma Chapter). Sure, I picked up some things in college, but think about
    it--it was probably the time in my life when I had the most leisure time, because
    I wasn't learning as much as other periods in my life.

    the benefits more skeptically, as no one presumes that merely being a college
    grad entitles one to success.

    taught well, but hardly worth $40k/year. These subjects are straitforward enough
    to allow a cheaper option that gives you the same result. And for the things that
    really can't be taught--who knows the right answer?--such as history, political
    science, and philosophy, it seems like top shelf professors are caricatures of
    leftist-PC propoganda.

    to 2000, I think the growth in wealth, liberty, and art, would be the singular
    effect. For a young person at a top school today, you will have to learn that
    on your own time, or in an economic history course (many colleges don''t have
    these, unfortunately). Rather, like the Marxist critique of capitalism, you will
    learn about all the injustice and inefficiency, and then naively assume that some
    utopian alternative is eminently feasible if we could only get the cabal of oppressors
    to stop manipulating the system.'
