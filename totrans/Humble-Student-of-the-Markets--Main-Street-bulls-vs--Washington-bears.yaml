    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    signal. A bullish Trend Model signal that gets less bullish is a trading "sell"
    signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading
    "buy" signal. The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of
    the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. Past trading of
    the trading model has shown turnover rates of about 200% per month.

    of both positive and negative concerns about the incoming administration spontaneously
    mentioned when asked about economic news. The importance of government policies
    and partisanship has sharply risen over the past half century. From 1960 to 2000,
    the combined average of positive and negative references to government policies
    was just 6%; during the past six years, this proportion averaged 20%, and rose
    to new peaks in early January, with positive and negative references totaling
    44%.

    be successful with his pro-growth agenda, even among Republicans. Traditional
    approaches to sentiment analysis states that the public tends to be slow. When
    the public finally latches onto an economic theme, it is indicative of a contrarian
    top (or bottom). On the other hand, the improvement in business and consumer confidence
    can be signals of broad based economic strength.

    also shows that forward P/E ratio is elevated and expensive compared to its own
    history. Current forward P/E is based on bottom-up derived earnings based only
    analyst expectations of economic conditions without the Trump fiscal plan. That's
    because you can't make estimates when you don't have the details of the proposals.
    A top-down analysis suggests that the Trump tax cuts could add roughly 10% to
    forward earnings, which would bring down the forward P/E ratio to more reasonable
    levels (annotations are mine).
