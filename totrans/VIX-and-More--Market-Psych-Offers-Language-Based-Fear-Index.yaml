    indices out there. Just a couple of months ago, for example, I was extolling the
    virtues of the [St. Louis Fed’s Financial Stress Index](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/09/st-louis-feds-financial-stress-index.html).

    media attention is the [Market Psych Fear Index](http://www.marketpsych.com/mkt_analysis.php).
    This index is constructed by using a 10-day exponential moving average of the
    percentage of “fear” words in the U.S. financial news. In the chart below, the
    Market Psych Fear Index is the solid blue line and the candlesticks are the NASDAQ-100
    index ([QQQQ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/QQQQ)).

    media, the fear index makes it possible to compare market-based fear measures
    such as the VIX and other volatility indices with the degree of public concern
    or perhaps even fear mongering found in the media.

    in opposite directions, just as is the case with the VIX and stocks. While this
    is the case more often than not, the chart below shows that in the last month
    or so, as stocks have been rising, the movements in stocks and the Market Psych
    Fear Index have been positively correlated. What does this mean? Perhaps all the
    talk of the [European sovereign debt crisis](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/European%20sovereign%20debt%20crisis)
    and North Korean aggression is starting to wear thin. Perhaps the media is not
    quite able to stir up fear like it has in the past. Of course, perhaps Occam’s
    razor would say that investors are being naïve.

    are predicting that the VIX will rise almost 50% by the middle of 2011.

    fear indicators bear further watching.

    content, not the least of which is sentiment-based analysis of [stocks](http://www.marketpsychadvisor.com/vitalsigns?ticker=C)
    and [ETFs](http://www.marketpsychadvisor.com/vitalsignssector?ticker=SPY), but
    also an excellent collection of [free personality tests](http://www.marketpsych.com/personality_test.php)
    for traders and investors.
