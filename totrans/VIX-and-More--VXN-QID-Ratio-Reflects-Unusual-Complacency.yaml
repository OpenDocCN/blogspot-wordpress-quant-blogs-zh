    Germany, and Spain apparently headed for a recession, and continuing turmoil in
    emerging markets, sometimes I am surprised to see any green at all on my screen.

    in the world’s financial system if the VIX is trading in the 24s.

- en: It’s a valid question – and one I have addressed in the past on the blog with
    the benefit of several indicators which help evaluate how much complacency is
    in the market. One of these is a ‘[fearogram](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/fearogram),’
    which measures the ratio of changes in the VIX to changes in the SPX. A similar
    tool is the [VIX:SDS ratio](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%3ASDS),
    which compares the relative movements of the VIX and [SDS](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SDS)
    (the double inverse ETF for the SPX) to historical patterns.

    ratio. This chart compares volatility in the NASDAQ-100 index (NDX) to the double
    inverse ETF for the NDX. There are (at least) three ways to think about complacency
    in this chart:'

    levels of complacency (i.e., less volatility and fear per unit of decline). The
    current ratio is moderately low on an absolute scale, but is lodged neatly between
    the 10 and 100 day SMAs. What I find particularly interesting about the chart
    is that in those instances in which the [VXN](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXN)
    has experienced a sustained rise over a period of several weeks or more (see top
    section of graphic), the current situation is the first time the ratio has *not*
    risen on par with the VXN. This development is a divergence worth watching and
    one which appears to favor the bears.

    Word and publishing them to Blogger. For the record, this is my first post using
    [Windows Live Writer](http://get.live.com/writer/overview), which has been up
    to the task so far...
