    a bad Friday, “Will this get substantially worse on Monday? Are we setting up
    for a crash like ’87?” It’s an interesting question. Was 1987 an anomaly or does
    a really bad Friday often carry through into the next week? Below I looked at
    all Fridays since 1960 that closed down at least 2.5%.

- en: The “Average Trade” column on the far right is skewed thanks to the ’87 crash
    which saw the market drop 20% on Monday. It appears in the almost all of the cases
    that the market was set up for a bounce based on Friday’s action rather than a
    crash. Of course while the last week has been bad, the market does remains in
    a long-term uptrend. I decided to filter the above results again to examine the
    bad Friday’s that appeared in long-term uptrends.

    bullish. Again they also suggest the bounce should basically come immediately.
