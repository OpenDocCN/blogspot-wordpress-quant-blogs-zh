    500 Index adjusted for inflation and average inflation-adjusted earnings over
    the past 12 months. We measure age distribution using the ratio of the middle-age
    cohort, age 40–49, to the old-age cohort, age 60–69\. We call this the M/O ratio.

- en: We prefer our M/O ratio to the M/Y ratio of middle-age to young adults, age
    20–29, studied by Geanakoplos et al. (2004). In our view, the saving and investment
    behavior of the old-age cohort is more relevant for asset prices than the behavior
    of young adults. Equity accumulation by young adults is low. To the extent they
    save, it is primarily for housing rather than for investment in the stock market.
    In contrast, individuals age 60–69 may shift their portfolios as their financial
    needs and attitudes toward risk change. Eligibility for Social Security pensions
    is also likely to play a first-order role in determining the life-cycle patterns
    of saving, especially for old-age individuals.

- en: The model-generated path for real stock prices implied by demographic trends
    is quite bearish. ***Real stock prices follow a downward trend until 2021***,
    cumulatively declining about 13% relative to 2010\. The subsequent recovery is
    quite slow. Indeed, real stock prices are not expected to return to their 2010
    level until 2027\. On the brighter side, as the M/O ratio rebounds in 2025, we
    should expect a strong stock price recovery. By 2030, our calculations suggest
    that the real value of equities will be about 20% higher than in 2010\.

    These kinds of estimate errors are to be expected in these kinds of long-term
    demographic studies. As they say, it's close enough for government work.

    annotations are mine). Note how the bull phases coincided with expansion of the
    market cap to GDP ratio. The equity market then topped out and then became range-bound,
    which coincided with a corrective phase in the market cap to GDP ratio, until
    that "valuation" metric returned to more realistic levels.

    highs seen at the NASDAQ peak in 2000, but not entirely. If I were to eyeball
    the chart, a market bottom around the end of this decade is quite plausible and
    likely given the current rate of descent of that ratio.

    policy. The buy-and-hold approach, long espoused by investment advisors during
    bull markets, will result in subpar returns in range-bound periods. Flat markets
