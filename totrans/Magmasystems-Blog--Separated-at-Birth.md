Don

Demsak

(

) and Kent

Tegels

(

).

Kent is the

SQL

Server

curriculum

developer at

DevelopMentor

. I took his most excellent course this week. I was surprised to see that I was the only person with a manager title in there. Surprisingly, lots of Visual FoxPro people were there. I didn't know that anyone used VFP in a corporate environment.

Don, Kent and I hoisted a few beers and claws at Ulysses Pub on Stone St, right in back of the Goldman Sachs building. Both will be at the MVP Summit in March, and I hope to attend sessions that are being hosted by their respective groups. I also hope that a lot of the "shortcomings" in SQL Server 2005 that Kent pointed out will be addressed by Microsoft in future releases.
