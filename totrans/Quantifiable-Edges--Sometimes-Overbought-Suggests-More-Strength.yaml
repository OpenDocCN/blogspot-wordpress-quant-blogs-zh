    likely.  When overbought gets powered through then odds will sometimes shift from
    a pullback to a continuation of that move.  The last two nights I have seen some
    studies suggesting this scenario.  The study below is on that I have showed a
    few times in the past.  All stats are updated.

    1-3 weeks.  In fact, below is a profit curve showing just how consistent it has
    been over the years using a 10-day exit.
