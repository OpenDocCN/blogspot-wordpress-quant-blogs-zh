    for this to be a minor pullback and I concur with the assessment that the bears
    are taking control of the tape. The tone of the [instant euphoria](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=ax1LLGc4FeVE)
    over yesterday's one-day rally of 2% is a contrary bearish signal that this market
    has further downside in the weeks ahead.

    level is often cited as a target, a 10-15% correction. That target level would
    roughly be the 200-day moving average should the market decline to those levels
    in the next two or three months.

    pivot down is around 882”.

    Jeremy Grantham’s [latest quarterly letter](http://www.gmo.com/websitecontent/JGLetter_ALL_3Q09.pdf)
    stated that GMO’s fair value on the S&P 500 is 860\. Grantham believes that a
    correction, when it comes, would be at least 15% and would likely overshoot their
    fair value estimate – which makes downside risk considerable from current levels.
    David Rosenberg believes that the [market is 20% overvalued](http://www.investmentpostcards.com/2009/10/28/rosenberg-stocks-overvalued-by-at-least-20/).
    By contrast, the market appears even more overvalued if we were to use [Tobin
    Q](http://www.smithers.co.uk/page.php?id=34) as a valuation standard.

    this is a minor pullback or a major correction that could see us test the 666
    old lows. I believe that the bears are in control, but here is what I am watching
    for to see how far the market could decline.

    the March lows has been a risk trade all the way up. It’s hasn’t been just stocks
    that have been rising, but all risky assets. I would therefore watch all risk
    measures, such as quality spreads in the bond market. More importantly, I would
    watch the US Dollar. [Art Cashin](http://www.cnbc.com//id/33491733) recently suggested
    that the USD has been the funding currency for currency carry trades and a big
    reversal in the greenback could cause over-leveraged hedge funds and trading desks
    to de-risk in a hurry. If reversals in the Dollar are subdued, then corrective
    action in the stock market could be subdued as well.'

    I pointed out that institutions and hedge funds were in a crowded long, but individual
    investors had been skeptical of the market rally. Watching indicators like the
    [AAII sentiment](http://www.sentimentrader.com/subscriber/charts/WEEKLY/SURVEY_AAII_BULLRATIO_4WK.htm)
    surveys would be an important sign in the weeks ahead of whether individuals buy
    on weakness, which would be bullish short term but bearish medium term, or stay
    cautious, which may portend a more limited correction. If individual investors
    are convinced that the [economy is truly turning around](http://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/national/gdp/gdpnewsrelease.htm)
    (and never mind the [snark](http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/2009/10/its_alive_its_a.html))
    and buy, then it could truly be a sign that we may have seen a multi-year top
    for the S&P 500\.'
