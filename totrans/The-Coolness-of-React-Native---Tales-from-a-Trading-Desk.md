## The Coolness of React Native

Whist in Sydney recently I went to the “Introduction to React Native” [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/future-mobile-apps/events/222472223/) at the News Corp offices.  Both presentations were good, but the demo at the end was enlightening, and force me to return to my hotel, complete the rebuilding of a completely broken OSX, and execute the Getting Started [guide](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#content) over on the React Native site.  React [Parts](http://react.parts/native-ios) was mentioned in the presentation as being the place to go for appropriate components – although the few components briefly scanned did appears to be missing [tests](http://simonsmith.io/unit-testing-react-components-without-a-dom/) 😦

Clearly although React Native is still in its early days it offers some coolness around building native iOS components.  Android appears to be possible with React Native in the future, and one can only assume Apple Watch iOS apps will also be supported
