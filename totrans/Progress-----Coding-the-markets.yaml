    tech is slower than one might think. I suggest it’s slower than even prog21 thinks,
    possibly negative even. Xerox had the [Alto running in 1973](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerox_Alto),
    and it had a GUI & mouse, TCP/IP networking and a Smalltalk-72 programming environment.
    So how much fundamental progress has there been since 1973 ?'
