- en: Speed bumps, the latest fad in market structure, are proliferating. The Chicago
    Stock Exchange (CHX) recently proposed a new type of speed bump in the US equities
    market, called the “[Liquidity Taking Access Delay](http://www.chx.com/chxltad/)”
    (LTAD). [[1](#bottom1chx)] The SEC’s decision whether to approve the LTAD could
    have a big impact on market structure, possibly more so than the IEX decision.

    Resting orders themselves may be modified or cancelled without delay. This is
    the LTAD.

    and marketable orders. But the exchange operates algorithmic order-types which
    adjust their attributes without delay. In particular, a displayed order can be
    pegged to undelayed price data, while its potential counterparties are subject
    to the delay.

    the context of Reg NMS) — each allows resting liquidity to fade in some way. But
    many end-users disagree, and asked the SEC to approve #4\. So, now that speed
    bumps exist and non-displayed peg orders may elide them, which of the other three
    asymmetric delays should be allowed?'

    to the maximum extent possible. Combining this principle with the new “de minimis”
    [interpretation](https://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2016-123.html) may imply
    that speed bumps of types #3 and #4 should be allowed. Healthy Markets takes this
    view. [[5](#bottom5chx)] I think it’s a bad idea for exchange algorithms to have
    a time-advantage that isn’t offered to traders. Exchanges have neither the incentive
    nor the expertise to optimize their pricing algorithms. [[6](#bottom6chx)] The
    traditional role of the exchange is to provide a meeting place for buyers and
    sellers, allowing them to transact at prices of their own choosing. Exchanges
    offer algorithmic order-types (like pegs) mainly for convenience, and I don’t
    think there should be any illusion that these order-types are as good as the techniques
    used by sophisticated brokers and traders. Providing exchange algos with a time-advantage
    will mean that they out-compete traders, who are otherwise superior in terms of
    their pricing accuracy, stability under stress, and diversity. Traders and their
    algorithms do make mistakes, but it’s hard to believe that an exchange algo monoculture
    can do better. Subsidizing inferior business methods reduces an industry’s productivity,
    and giving exchange algorithms a structural advantage would be no different.'

    allowed, then #1 should be allowed. Since #4 is already approved, the only thing
    to consider is whether it should be permissible for delays to have asymmetries
    in how they apply to accessing **displayed** quotes. The [comments](https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-chx-2016-16/chx201616.shtml)
    mostly do a good job explaining why asymmetries are problematic for displayed
    market structure. [[7](#bottom7chx)] In short, if displayed orders are given extra
    time to decide whether to consummate a trade, a large number of quotes will be
    practically inaccessible, even though it’d be prohibited to lock, cross, or trade-through
    those quotes. [[8](#bottom8chx)] Even in markets without these regulations, such
    as FX, last look causes [difficulty](https://www.ft.com/content/875640f0-a325-11e5-bc70-7ff6d4fd203a).
    [[9](#bottom9chx)] The consequences of combining last look with order protection
    are unpredictable, but they seem unlikely to be good for long-term traders.'

    last look, only options #2 and #4 should be permitted. There is a tradeoff, though.
    Giving only hidden orders a time-advantage will incentivize dark trading. I doubt
    that the major exchanges would become as [dark as IEX](http://meanderful.blogspot.com/2016/10/iex-dark-and-expensive.html),
    but the equities market would probably become less transparent.'

    not be the most important exchange, but like IEX, any precedent it sets applies
    to other exchanges. [[10](#bottom10chx)] Restricting speed-bump-asymmetries to
    hidden orders has drawbacks, but it might be the only way Reg NMS can keep limping

    and [trades](http://www.finra.org/industry/trade-reporting-faq#102) to be published
    to the SIP without delay. Though perhaps this requirement doesn’t apply to “de
    minimis” delays?

    to trade aggressively with resting orders which can’t be cancelled without going
    through a delay. IEX’s DPEG does this via its “book recheck” [mechanism](https://mechanicalmarkets.wordpress.com/2015/08/11/iex-ideology-and-the-role-of-an-exchange/#3iex2).'

    CHX [argues](http://www.chx.com/_posts/rule-filings/ProposedFilings/CHX-2016-16.pdf)
    that its ETF quotes are victims of “latency arbitrage,” and that the LTAD will
    prevent this. If the SEC rejects the LTAD, CHX might propose another type of speed
    bump, where CHX manages displayed orders in ETFs (e.g. SPY, QQQ, etc) by pegging
    them to undelayed CME market data. Will CHX understand the relationship that these
    ETFs have to futures markets as well as professional traders do? And these ETFs
    are just the simple cases — imagine what kind of pegs an exchange might come up
    with to prevent market makers from being “picked off” on XOM when the price of
    crude or CVX moves. I’m sure exchanges can think of peg algos that market makers
    would find very useful, but is that really what we want exchanges [doing](https://mechanicalmarkets.wordpress.com/2015/08/11/iex-ideology-and-the-role-of-an-exchange/)?'
