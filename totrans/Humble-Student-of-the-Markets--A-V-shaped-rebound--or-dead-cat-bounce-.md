# Humble Student of the Markets: A V-shaped rebound, or dead cat bounce?

**Mid-week market update**: I presented this chart on the weekend and rhetorically asked if the inevitable market bounce would be durable. Since then, the S&P 500 rallied strongly off last Friday's oversold condition. In addition, the stochastic recycled from oversold to neutral, which is a tactical buy signal.

Does this mean the relief rally isn't a dead cat bounce, but a durable V-shaped rebound?
