- en: The above chart shows the price graph of the Reuters/Jeffries CRB Index and
    the timing of the most recent signal. The Inflation-Deflation Timer model turned
    bullish on inflation and commodities in late July and moved to a neutral stance
    this week, which represents a profit of about 8.5%.

- en: There is a possibility that the model could turn positive on inflation again.
    The commodity and stock markets appear to be staging an oversold rally, which
    could create a whipsaw condition and flip the model back to inflation. Such a
    reversal is likely to be a fake-out. For example, consider the technical position
    of gold, a leading indicator of inflationary expectations. Gold is facing significant
    resistance

    from a position of holding a basket of commodities into a 100% equity allocation.
    However, I would be inclined to be more cautious than to assume the risk of an
    all-equity portfolio.

    makes us highly nervous about a full all-equity commitment. Under these circumstances,
    I would be inclined to add a greater bond component to a balanced fund portfolio.
