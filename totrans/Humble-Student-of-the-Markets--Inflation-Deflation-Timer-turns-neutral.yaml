    the timing of the most recent signal. The Inflation-Deflation Timer model turned
    bullish on inflation and commodities in late July and moved to a neutral stance
    this week, which represents a profit of about 8.5%.

    The commodity and stock markets appear to be staging an oversold rally, which
    could create a whipsaw condition and flip the model back to inflation. Such a
    reversal is likely to be a fake-out. For example, consider the technical position
    of gold, a leading indicator of inflationary expectations. Gold is facing significant
    resistance

    from a position of holding a basket of commodities into a 100% equity allocation.
    However, I would be inclined to be more cautious than to assume the risk of an
    all-equity portfolio.
