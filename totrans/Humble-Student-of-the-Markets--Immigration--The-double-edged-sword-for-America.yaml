- en: With an election year coming up in the United States, immigration is one of
    those hot-button issues that has been dividing people. But the electorate has
    to remember that the immigrant experience is part of the American Dream of rags
    to riches. The trend toward rising barriers to immigration, legal and otherwise,
    is also raising barriers to job creation and, longer term, barriers to the nurturing
    of human capital in America.

    more than half of all Silicon Valley start-ups were launched by immigrants. In
    2007, I warned that by making itself less hospitable to immigrant students, scientists,
    and entrepreneurs, the United States was undermining its own interests. "What
