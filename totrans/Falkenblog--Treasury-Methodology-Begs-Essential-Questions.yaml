- en: To guide estimation, the BHCs were provided with a range of indicative two‐year
    cumulative loss rates for each of the 12 loan categories for the baseline and
    more adverse scenarios. [Banks] were permitted to submit loss rates outside of
    the ranges, but were required to provide strong supporting evidence, especially
    if they fell below the range minimum. The indicative loss rate ranges were derived
    using a variety of methods for predicting loan losses, including analysis of historical
    loss experience at large BHCs and quantitative models relating the performance
    of individual loans and groups of loans to macroeconomic variables.

    and residential real estate (2007+). You can always count on regulators to protect
    us against the most recent credit events. Odds that the next banking crisis is
    centered in some subcategory of ''other'': 98.76%.'

    falls another 20%, what are the effects on all these categories? The white paper
    does not say. What is the Treasury's base assumption for the average asset in
    these 12 categories? Who knows!

- en: Ask yourself how much money your business would lose if GDP fell by 4%. Do you
    know with any certainty? Of course not, no one does. It will fall, but any exact
    number is spurious precision. Their estimates have large standard errors. They
    may be decent estimates, but this is the Federal Government operating in a very
    politicized environment so I'm not going to give them the benefit of the doubt.
    Their reluctance to say what these numbers are, on average, for the 12 lending
    areas, suggests they are not confident enough to defend them.

    Gee, you have two fancy numbers in there to many digits, but as "X" is unknown,
    it really does not clarify anything.
