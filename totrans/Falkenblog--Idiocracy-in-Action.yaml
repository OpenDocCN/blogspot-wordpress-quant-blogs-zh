    issues trading off redistribution and efficiency. As most people have instincts
    on the long run effects of their favored policies but no definitive proof, people
    tend to be get very frustrated and emotional discussing these issues because we
    don't like arguing about things we believe but can't prove. I believe a

    Idol to agree with you.  When I used to teach at Northwestern University I occasionally
    asked what students thought about popular topics like  'free trade' or 'market
    efficiency'. Their opinions were so poorly articulated and founded, I stopped
    doing that. It did not help to have people riff on subjects they really didn't
    understand, the errors were so numerous and fundamental it simply was a waste
    of time.  I realized then that gaining their support would either rely on authority--believe
    me because I have these credentials--or slick salesmanship. Both methods are not
    good at converging upon truth. In the end I tried to explain some fundamental
    ideas showing why, given certain assumptions, one could think something was optimal,
    so the best case scenario was not definitive anyway.

    with the power to make decisions over whether we should spend another $800B, or
    choose judges for their biases (given smart lawyers, is not hard to do for almost
    any bias).  This is not a wise way to make policy. Unfortunately, alternatives
    aren't obvious, and certainly not popular. For example, something akin to a literacy
    test would enhance our voting competence, but would statistically discriminate
    against certain groups, and I'm doubtful it would be more enlightened anyway. The
    old belief of J.S. Mill that if we merely educated everyone we would agree and
    choose wise policies is clearly wrong.

    because when a state is small, an aristocracy/oligarchy is concentrated enough
    to work, but it doesn't scale. At a certain point the aristocracy is fragmented
    but the titular head retains his power,  which is then amplified by his new relative
    strength, making the legislative branch a veto at best, a patronage machine at
    worst.  The House and Senate remain more powerful than the President, but they
    seem to lose stature every decade.

  zh: --权力更加集中在总统或皇帝手中。我认为这是因为当一个国家很小的时候，贵族/寡头政治足够集中进行运作，但它不可扩展。在某一点上，贵族们开始分裂，但名义上的首领保留了他的权力，这时他的相对实力就被放大了，使得立法部门在最好的情况下成为否决权，最坏的情况下成为一个赏赐机器。众议院和参议院比总统更有权力，但他们似乎每十年都失去一些威望。
- en: But most importantly for this day, voting in big elections does not matter at
    all. Consider you live in Florida, which decides the presidential election. You
    cast the deciding vote, your candidate winning by 1 vote. In such a case, the
    stakes are so high that very good lawyers would be called in, and the better or
    more powerful lawyers would find the definition of what constitutes a legitimate
    vote such that your decisive vote would be irrelevant. That is, lawyers can use
    one of several metrics of voting, some of which will show their candidate winning,
    some losing, for any close election (just like polls generate different results
    depending on demographics). That's what happened in Minnesota, where the Republican
    was winning the senate race by 700 hundred votes, but the much stronger Democratic
    party in this state had a much more vigorous counsel helping them 'recount' the
    votes, and
