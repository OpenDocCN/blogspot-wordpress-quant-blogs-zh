    in a reliable way to adjust your trading strategies accordingly. We need a way
    of measuring things so that we can adjust our strategies based on a change in
    some measure that is predictive of future behavior. For example, we know that
    human beings have an internal temperature of 98 degrees–under this circumstance,
    a person behaves quite normally. However, shift that temperature up to 104 degrees
    and that same person will behave very differently. If we shift that temperature
    to 93/94 degrees, a similar radical change in behavior is observed. More importantly–and
    this has subtle implications–under most circumstances these shifts in temperature
    are caused by some environmental influence, and once the environment changes a
    person will return to stasis at 98 degrees. The body temperature can also help
    us differentiate between different species–for example biologists make the distinction
    between warm-blooded and cold-blooded animals that have different behavior as
    a function of temperature. What we need for the stock market is some absolute
    measure that helps us predict a change in the behavior for stocks/markets, and
    also a means of  classifying different species/markets.

    person that I have had several discussions with in recent times is Frank Hassler
    of the blog **Engineering Returns** [http://engineering-returns.com/2010/06/28/aapl-ts/](http://engineering-returns.com/2010/06/28/aapl-ts/)
    Frank is a very intelligent and also very diligent researcher that likes to research
    any and all ideas–a trait that I definitely respect. Frank was inspired by some
    of the research introduced on the LTR (Livermore Trend Ranking) and the necessity
    for classifying stocks as either mean-reversion or trending. In the course of
    his research, Frank was generous enough to share one of the indicators that he
    created that he calls the TSI- for Trend Strength Index. The TSI is an intermediate-term
    absolute (versus relative ) measure of the tendency of a stock to trend or mean
    revert.  The premise underlying the theory is that stocks with a high degree of
    momentum in relation to volatility are much less likely to mean-revert than those
    that have a low degree of momentum in relation to volatility.

    in relation to the strength of their overall trend. This is what makes them difficult
    to trade counter-trend since a) they have fewer opportunities/fewer pullbacks
    or ralles b) the few pullbacks/rallies are either immediately followed by higher
    or lower prices in the direction of the trend, or an abrupt change in the trend
    altogether. In contrast this makes them much easier to trade with the trend, since
    the reward relative to uncertainty is higher in most scenarios.  Tommorow, I will
    introduce the formula for the TSI and also some results. This indicator is highly
    useful at determining which  stocks to trade with the trend, and which stocks
    to avoid trend trading in favor of a mean-reversion strategy. The TSI can also
    be used as a measure to apply to the same stock as a trend filter.
