- en: '[Eurex](http://www.eurexchange.com) publishes a lot of intersting information
    about the heavily traded Euro Govt Bond futures, Schatz (2yr), Bobl (5yr) and
    Bund (10yr). You can see the trade volume on each contract for today [here](http://www.eurexchange.com/market/quotes/INT/FIX_en.html),
    together with the open interest. You can see a 15 min delayed price chart for
    Schatz [here](http://www.eurexchange.com/market/quotes/INT/FIX/FGBS_en.html#table).
    But most interestingly, you can get access to [historical order book data](http://www.eurexchange.com/market/historical_orderbook_en.html).
    You have to pay for it of course, but there’s a free sample in the big zip: a
    full day’s data for [Bund on 23 Mar 2007](http://www.eurexchange.com/download/market/FGBL_1_20070323.zip)
    including all orders and trades. From this data one could reconstruct the state
    of the order book at any point during the day with disaggregated depth.'
