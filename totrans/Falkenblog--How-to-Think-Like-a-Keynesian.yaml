    with the Victoria’s Secret models. And if any of them are rude enough to point
    out that I’m lying, I’ll simply explain that I started with an assumption of spending
    -7 nights with the supermodels. And since I actually spent zero nights with them,
    that means a net of +7\. Some of you may be wondering whether it makes sense to
    begin with an assumption of “-7 nights,” but I figure that’s okay since Keynesians
    begin with the assumption that you can increase your prosperity by transferring
    money from your left pocket to your right pocket.
