- en: Using the S&P500 index as a proxy for the market, a simulation was run over
    the lifetime of the index. Notice the system excels in both the very short run,
    and much longer periods. The short system did very poorly overall and did not
    perform nowhere near the long side in any of the overall periods (except maybe
    very short term). A possible explanation is that short side systems do not do
    very well in the long run due to upward drift of markets. In addition, short side
    runs do not have the inherent compounding power of long sides as they are asymmetrical.
    The most you gain on a short run is double your original value, where the long
    side is unlimited (one way around this limitation is using inverse ETFs). I believe
    many common simulators err in the effects and method of this computation.

    region. In light of commissions and limited short strategy performance over longer
    periods, it might pay to use the long only portion of the strategy. Another observation
    is to possibly step aside during highly volatile regions in order to capture the
    beneficial areas of the long strategy. Some of the methods to approach this type
    of regime switching have been mentioned in earlier posts.

    and optimization, is that as evidenced in the above simulation, you will often
    find the the local optimal parameter value turns out to be the most robust, as
    it will perform best over a wide range of sensitivity to parametrization.
