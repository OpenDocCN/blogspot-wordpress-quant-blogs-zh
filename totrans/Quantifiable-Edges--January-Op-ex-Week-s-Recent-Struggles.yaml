- en: January op-ex week has been a tough week for the market since 1999\. Interesting
    about January op-ex week is that it often occurs in conjunction with Martin Luther
    King Day. Below is a list of the last 13 January op-ex weeks with their performance
    results. Note that some of these weeks contained four trading days and some contained
    five. In either case the market was assumed to have been “bought” the Friday before
    op-ex Friday and “sold” on op-ex Friday.

    The drawdown / run-up stats at the bottom are especially compelling for the bears.
