    Markets, a flexible, high-throughput, low-latency platform. The WebSphere Front
    Office platform is built on an award-winning portfolio of IBM middleware products
    that provide an integrated environment **optimized for high-volume trading**.*
    **Several innovative technologies from the IBM Research Lab in Haifa enabled the
    platform''s performance characteristics and the high availability support including
    detection, notification and recovery.* **"This is IBM''s first appearance in the
    financial front office space for **stock exchanges and large institutional customers**,
    which is characterized by extreme data rates measured in **hundreds thousands
    messages per second**, and by **sub-millisecond delivery latency requirements.**"*
    **The **Reliable Multicast** Messaging ([RMM](http://www.haifa.ibm.com/projects/software/rmsdk/gridcc.html))
    technology and TurboFlow technologies have enabled IBM to address these performance
    goals and to build an infrastructure that supports the extremely challenging demands
    of front office financial customers. **In addition to high throughput and low
    latency, RMM is characterized by significant scalability that allows the delivery
    of financial information to multiple traders at the same time.*** **Combined with
    the ITRA (Inter-Tier. Relationship architecture) technology it allows for **subsecond
    data stream failover**.*'

    messages per second, it would be interesting to see if this new product could
    handle it.
