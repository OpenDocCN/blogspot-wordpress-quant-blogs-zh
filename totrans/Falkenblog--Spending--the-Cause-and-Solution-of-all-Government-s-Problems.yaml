    growth over the long term. It is not the only part of it, but it is an important
    part of it...If there are steps in the short term [that] may reduce the amount
    of cash in the treasury but in the long term mean we are growing at 3.5 percent
    instead of 2.5 percent, then those ideas are worth exploring,

    growth rates. This is all from the magic of the multiplier, where investments
    that would be wasteful in the private sector have a positive NPV in the public
    sector. This makes sense to most modern macroeconomists and they provide the intellectual
    cover for those who don't understand it but want it to be true. Economists have

    and innovative public schools for all children. Real opportunity would mean a
    job at a living wage for everyone who was willing to work, jobs that can return
    some structure and dignity to people's lives and give inner-city children something
    more than a basketball rim to shoot for. In the short run, such ladders of opportunity
    are going to cost more, not less, than either welfare or affirmative action. But,
    in the long run, our investment should payoff handsomely. That we fail to make
    this investment is just plain stupid.
