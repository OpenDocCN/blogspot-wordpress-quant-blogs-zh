- en: The suit against BAC/Countrywide was based on disparate impact, basically looking
    at averages for Blacks and Latinos vs. EveryoneElse. Presumably they controlled
    for some kind of credit metric too, but as Thomas Sowell has noted many times,
    it is common to run a regression looking for discrimination with an incomplete
    proxy for education like whether they had a degree, then put in a dummy variable
    for race, and find discrimination by looking at the loading on the race dummy,
    even though given the lower socio-economic status of minorities the variable omits
    a lot of other important variables (eg, what kind of school? what kind of degree?).

- en: In 2007, for example, Countrywide employees charged Hispanic applicants in Los
    Angeles an average of $545 more in fees for a $200,000 loan than they charged
    non-Hispanic white applicants with similar credit histories. Independent brokers
    processing applications for a Countrywide loan charged Hispanics $1,195 more,
    the department said.

    crisis is that they foisted loans upon people who couldn't afford to pay them
    back. Isn't price the key way a supplier rations goods to consumers? As Jesse

    if prices rose--as they had for the past 10 years--they would win big, if prices
    fell they could walk away and leave the bank with the property. Mortgages are
    non-recourse, banks can''t take anything more than your mortgage back. Thus, I
    don''t see the overpaying minorities as victims here so much as greedy dupes who
    were part of the mortgage fiasco.'

    are simply inconsistent allegations, highlighting the no-win situation for bank
    lenders. With such rules, no wonder political insiders like Peter Orszag, Henry
    Cisneros, and Bob Rubin are essential banking executive talent.
