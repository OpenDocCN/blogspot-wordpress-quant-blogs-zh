- en: Finishes like Tuesday’s often feel bearish to many traders. They interpret the
    inability of the market to hold on to its gains as a potential negative. In actuality,
    while the market may struggle over the next 1-2 days, over the course of the next
    1-2 weeks implications appear bullish.

    in the above table is that 19 of 24 instances (79%) posted a close higher than
    the trigger day within 3 days. Looking out 6 days that number increases to 23
    of 24 instances (96%).
