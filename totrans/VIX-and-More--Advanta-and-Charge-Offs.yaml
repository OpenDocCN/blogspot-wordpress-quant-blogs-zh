- en: In a story that I believe was underreported yesterday, the nation’s 11^(th)
    largest [credit card](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/credit%20cards)
    issuer, Advanta ([ADVNB](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/ADVNB)),
    [announced](http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId=20090511006533&newsLang=en)
    it will be suspending all credit card charges on outstanding credit cards as of
    June 10^(th) in order to “dramatically limit the company’s credit loss exposure
    and maximize its capital and its liquidity measures.”

  zh: 我认为昨天被报道得不够的故事是，全国第11大信用卡发行商Advanta([ADVNB](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/ADVNB))宣布，从6月10日起，将暂停所有信用卡账户的信用卡收费，以“大幅限制公司的信用损失风险并最大化其资本和流动性措施”。
- en: As of March 31^(st), Advanta’s charge-off rate stood at 20%.

  zh: 截至3月31日，Advanta的坏账率为20%。
- en: The credit card freeze will affect all of Advanta’s almost one million existing
    small business credit card accounts. While Advanta does not offer personal credit
    cards, all of the small business accounts are backed by personal guarantees. Given
    that approximately 25% of the outstanding balances on Advanta’s credit cards are
    from small businesses in California and Florida, there is a strong possibility
    that the rising charge-off rate is related to declining real estate values – and
    that many of Advanta’s small business accounts were sole proprietors using their
    card ostensibly as consumer credit cards, yet with higher credit lines.

  zh: Advanta的信用卡冻结将影响该公司几乎全部的一百万个小企业信用卡账户。虽然Advanta不提供个人信用卡，但所有的小企业账户都由个人担保。考虑到Advanta信用卡上的逾期未付余额约有25%来自加利福尼亚和佛罗里达州的小企业，很可能会出现上升的坏账率与下降的房地产价值有关——许多Advanta的小企业账户是个人经营，他们用信用卡作为消费者信用卡，但信用额度更高。
- en: Advanta’s announcement comes less than a week after two other credit card companies,
    American Express ([AXP](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/AXP)) and
    Capital One ([COF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/COF)), passed the
    government’s stress test and were deemed sufficiently capitalized so as not to
    be required to raise any additional capital.

  zh: Advanta公司宣布的消息是在另外两家信用卡公司——美国运通([AXP](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/AXP))和资本一([COF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/COF))通过政府的压力测试并被认为是资本充足之后不到一周的时间内。这些公司不需要筹集额外资本。
