    makes the interesting observation that as labor income has declined over the past
    century, this allowed capital to reap more reward than what is merely in GDP growth
    (see chart below).  Yet, this cannot continue any more than bonds can appreciate
    from lower yields.  The result is pretty scary, because as Gross points out, a
    4.75% asset return premium needs about a 7% growth from equities if bonds are
    going to generate 2% returns, and if this won't happen, CalPERS and many of its
    ilk are in serious trouble.

    developing countries between equity returns and GDP growth, over many decades.
    This is really interesting because most general equilibrium models of asset growth
    would show a relationship, and so to my mind this highlights the inappropriateness
    of 'Lucas tree models' for understanding the aggregate stock market. Equities
    should not be thought of as residual claims on an economy, but rather the peculiar
    returns to an asset class in a very complex equilibrium.

    This is obviously a huge return for those fortunate enough to get such shares,
    but unless you are Nancy Pelosi, or an investor who perpetually overpays for commissions,
    you don't get that one-day pop. That is, the investment banks capture this return
    by making investors overpay (or grant regulatory favors), so non-politicians don't
    capture any of this net net. The net money always goes to insiders, not passive
    investors, in hedge funds, corporate equity, corporate bonds, etc. Those big passive
    equity funds are like kids showing up to a trendy club and finding out that you
    need more than money to get in, you need connections, something unique to exchange.

    as they used to, so they can't afford to give away big returns to top-line stock
    indices. On top of low current long-term bond yields, this suggests weak equity
    returns going forward.

    have to generate a 6% real premium to compensate for the fact they are riskier
    than cash, noting their high volatility, and draw-downs during famously bad times
    like the Great Depression, WW2, and various financial crises. Yet it is pretty
    clear that risk is not correlated with higher returns within a variety of asset
    classes, such as equities, corporate bonds from BBB to C. Even GMO

    zero risk premiums everywhere, when you look at assets in total. In any case,
    whether you believe in a large equity premium or not, there appears little reason
    to be in those highly volatile classes, unless you are like most people and overconfident
    about your stock picking abilities. This little conceit facilitates a rather large
    cluster-puck of mistaken assumptions, and I'm afraid most people will take the
    wrong lesson (eg, Joe Nocera's latest

    more giant corporations with governmental influence, privileges, and resulting
    decreases in efficiency and competition. That will hurt GDP growth.
