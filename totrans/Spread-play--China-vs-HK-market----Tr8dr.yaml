- en: If one looks at the [annual performance](http://finance.yahoo.com/charts#chart1:symbol=fxi;range=1y;compare=ewh;charttype=line;crosshair=on;logscale=on;source=undefined)
    of FXI (China index) versus EWH (HK index), we see a widening spread over the
    last year, but a lot of simularity in the chart patterns. I suspect these markets
    are cointegrated, but with a scaling factor (a difference in slope).

    indicates that chinese will soon be able to invest in the HK market. With the
    huge flow of speculative money in China soon to be able to find alternative venues
    (such as HK), should expect to see a move of some of this buying pressure into
    the HK market.
