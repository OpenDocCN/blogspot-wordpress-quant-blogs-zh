    launched at the end of January, set a new volume record yesterday, with 336,384
    shares traded. This breaks the previous record that was set on the second day
    of trading, back at the beginning of February.'

    will prove to be a meaningful sentiment indicator with the passage of time. Volume
    climaxes should provide some insight into the mindset of the retail trader and
    provide some contrarian signals at sentiment extremes.

- en: With all that said, I was a little surprised to see the new VXX volume record
    established yesterday. As the brokers I use do not allow VXX to be traded on margin
    and thus do not allow VXX to be sold short, I am led to conclude that yesterday’s
    volume record is most likely speculative activity on the part of those who think
    the hoopla over the recent mini-rally and talk of the death of volatility are
    premature.
