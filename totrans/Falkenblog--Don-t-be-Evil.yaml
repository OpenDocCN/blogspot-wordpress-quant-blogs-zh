- en: '"Don''t be evil" is the informal corporate motto for Google, established by
    Gmail inventor Paul Buchheit. Buchheit, who suggested the slogan in a meeting,
    said he "wanted something that, once you put it in there, would be hard to take
    out," adding that the slogan was "also a bit of a jab at a lot of the other companies,
    especially our competitors, who at the time, in our opinion, were kind of exploiting
    the users to some extent." "Don''t be evil" is said to recognize that large corporations
    can often maximize short-term profits with actions that destroy long-term brand
    image and competitive position. By instilling a Don''t Be Evil culture, the corporation
    establishes a baseline for decision making that can enhance the trust and image
    of the corporation that outweighs short-term gains from violating the Don''t Be
    Evil principles.'

  zh: '“不作恶”是谷歌的非正式企业格言，由Gmail发明者保罗·布赫海特创立。布克海特在一次会议上提出了这个口号，他说他“想要一种一旦放进去就很难拿出来的东西”，并补充说这个口号“也有点针对其他很多公司，特别是我们的竞争对手，在我们看来，他们当时在某种程度上剥削了用户。”据说，“不要作恶”认识到大公司通常可以通过破坏长期品牌形象和竞争地位的行为来实现短期利润最大化。通过灌输“不作恶”文化，公司建立了一个决策基准，可以增强公司的信任和形象，超过违反“不作恶”原则的短期收益。'
- en: As with the Golden Rule, one would think this is all obvious. But it is not.
    Evil exists, and it's not Snidely Whiplash types who say they wish to do bad things,
    like sadists, but rather, paranoids using principle as a pretext. I think that
    all the poster children of evil in the the 20th century--Pol Pot, Stalin, Mao,
    Hitler, Manson--were sincere in thinking they were making the world a better place.
    They were just 1) wrong in their assumptions and 2) indifferent to the suffering
    of individuals. That is, even if you think that Germans are the Master Race, or
    that socialism is utopia, expediting the journey via massive starvation and slaughter
    is simply immoral and wrong. Further, in every case, it was not even true their
    assumptions were right, so the path they were so excited about getting to was
    not utopia, but rather, hell. Clearly these errors are correlated, in that, Hayek
    might think a republican government of state minimalism is optimal, but it would
    be inconsistent to treat people as means to an end. Milton Friedman wanted to
    shrink the government, but because he believed in liberty, and the value of individuals,
    it would have never occurred to him to kill groups to get there. And so, I think
    evil is basically ignorance, and has absolutely nothing to do with sincerity.

- en: It seems there are many people who own mansions and corporate jets, and are
    worth hundreds of millions of dollars, who treat individuals as means to an end,
    and wish to make examples out of them based on some paranoid principle. These
    people are clearly sociopaths, but I feel no pity for them, any more than I feel
    pity for violent rapists because they are obviously mentally unhinged. It is their
    victims who deserve our support; sociopaths, especially ones of means, need disincentives,
    not more group hugs. They have enough enablers telling them that their behavior
    is somehow reasonable (all on the hope of getting some of the power or money from
    such rich people).

  zh: 似乎有许多拥有豪宅和企业喷气机，身价数亿美元的人，他们将个人视为达到目的的手段，并希望根据某种偏执的原则将他们作为例子。这些人显然是反社会者，但我对他们没有同情，就像我对暴力强奸犯没有同情一样，因为他们显然精神错乱。他们的受害者才值得我们支持；反社会者，尤其是有能力的反社会者，需要的是抑制，而不是更多的集体拥抱。他们已经有足够的支持者告诉他们，他们的行为在某种程度上是合理的（都是希望从这些富人那里得到一些权力或金钱）。
- en: But clearly those with the means to inflict such evil are small, relegated to
    wealthy sociopaths. But what about those in a position to help, but choose to
    do nothing? As Abraham Lincoln said, 'Nearly all men can stand adversity, but
    if you want to test a man’s character, give him power'. And so, most cubicle slaves
    aren't in a position to manifest any sociopathic qualities. But many are given
    small opportunities, that are like little 'tells' in poker, and give away a moral
    emptiness.

  zh: 但显然，有能力施加这种邪恶的人是少数，仅限于富有的反社会者。那么那些有能力帮助却选择无所作为的人呢？正如亚伯拉罕·林肯所说，'几乎所有人都能忍受逆境，但如果你想测试一个人的品格，就给他权力'。因此，大多数办公室职员并不处于能展现任何反社会特质的地位。但许多人得到了小小的机会，这些机会就像扑克中的小'暗示'，揭示了道德的空虚。

    has, I think, a duty to act, because choosing to do nothing is a choice. Further,
    when the choice merely asks one to behave reasonably, to espouse the truth, the
    'risks' are always there but are small, not like asking someone to jump into a
    race riot to save their lone buddy.

  zh: 这种因疏忽而导致的道德缺失，如同不做善良的撒玛利亚人。我认为，人们有责任采取行动，因为选择无所作为本身就是一种选择。进一步说，当选择仅仅是要求一个人表现得合理，坚持真理时，虽然风险始终存在，但它们微不足道，并不像要求某人跳入种族暴乱中去拯救他们孤单的伙伴那样。
- en: Most of us, after grade school, are no longer called upon to exhibit physical
    courage. But intellectual courage is called upon, and generally journalists and
    educators prop up the heroes of the past and say, I would have been behind Galileo
    or Ruby Bridges. Who wouldn't? The real question is, if you saw someone getting
    railroaded, would you stand up and say, to someone important in the process, this
    is not right, knowing that you would incur the wrath of the powerful instigator?
    Unfortunately, most people, even seemingly very religious, and empathetic people,
    do not.

  zh: 大多数人在小学毕业后，就不再被要求展现身体的勇气。但智识的勇气却被召唤，通常记者和教育者会推崇过去的英雄，并说，我本会支持伽利略或鲁比·布里奇斯。谁不会呢？真正的问题是，如果你看到有人被冤枉，你是否会站出来，向过程中的重要人物说，这是不对的，明知这样做会招致强大煽动者的怒火？遗憾的是，大多数人，即使是看似非常虔诚和富有同情心的人，也不会这么做。
- en: Flaubert said, 'Our ignorance of history makes us libel our own times. People
    have always been like this.' Most people are intellectual cowards, that is, are
    afraid of reprobation, or making enemies in social circles. My kids learn about
    Civil Rights constantly, as if this is to teach them courage, but learning about
    courage this way is very misleading, because we have a case where there was a
    bad thing that is no longer defended by anyone sane. So to teach courage via this
    tale is like teaching about scientific courage by pointing to the idiocy of the
    flat-earthers. I think a better education would be to look at Hitler, and see,
    OK, he needed a pretext to arouse the masses, and the Jews were good. Why? Because
    they were unsypmathetic. Why? They were disproportionately successful. Why is
    that sufficient? Because they were depersonalized, rationalized via social Darwinism,
    etc. That would be much more informative than merely saying that those in favor
    of allowing blacks to enroll in white schools were right. My boys learn about
    a caricature of evil in school, they don't learn the real thing, and I see the
    moral effect this has on current adults--they have learned, or become, nothing.
    Hopefully, my kids won't experience evil, but as Flaubert noted, it's as probable
    as ever.

  zh: 福楼拜曾说：'我们对历史的无知使我们诽谤我们自己的时代。人们总是如此。'大多数人都是知识上的懦夫，即害怕被谴责，或在社交圈中树敌。我的孩子们不断学习民权运动，似乎这是在教他们勇气，但通过这种方式学习勇气非常误导人，因为我们有一个案例，其中一件坏事不再被任何理智的人捍卫。因此，通过这个故事来教授勇气，就像通过指出地平论者的愚蠢来教授科学勇气一样。我认为更好的教育应该是研究希特勒，并看到，好吧，他需要一个借口来煽动群众，而犹太人很合适。为什么？因为他们不受欢迎。为什么？他们过于成功。为什么这足够了？因为他们被去个性化，通过社会达尔文主义等被合理化。这比仅仅说那些支持黑人进入白人学校的观点是正确的要更有启发性。我的孩子们在学校学到的只是邪恶的漫画，他们没有学到真正的邪恶，我看到这对当今成年人的道德影响——他们学到了，或者说变成了，什么都没有。希望我的孩子们不会经历邪恶，但正如福楼拜所指出的，这和以往一样可能。
