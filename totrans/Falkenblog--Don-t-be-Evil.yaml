    Gmail inventor Paul Buchheit. Buchheit, who suggested the slogan in a meeting,
    said he "wanted something that, once you put it in there, would be hard to take
    out," adding that the slogan was "also a bit of a jab at a lot of the other companies,
    especially our competitors, who at the time, in our opinion, were kind of exploiting
    the users to some extent." "Don''t be evil" is said to recognize that large corporations
    can often maximize short-term profits with actions that destroy long-term brand
    image and competitive position. By instilling a Don''t Be Evil culture, the corporation
    establishes a baseline for decision making that can enhance the trust and image
    of the corporation that outweighs short-term gains from violating the Don''t Be
    Evil principles.'

    Evil exists, and it's not Snidely Whiplash types who say they wish to do bad things,
    like sadists, but rather, paranoids using principle as a pretext. I think that
    all the poster children of evil in the the 20th century--Pol Pot, Stalin, Mao,
    Hitler, Manson--were sincere in thinking they were making the world a better place.
    They were just 1) wrong in their assumptions and 2) indifferent to the suffering
    of individuals. That is, even if you think that Germans are the Master Race, or
    that socialism is utopia, expediting the journey via massive starvation and slaughter
    is simply immoral and wrong. Further, in every case, it was not even true their
    assumptions were right, so the path they were so excited about getting to was
    not utopia, but rather, hell. Clearly these errors are correlated, in that, Hayek
    might think a republican government of state minimalism is optimal, but it would
    be inconsistent to treat people as means to an end. Milton Friedman wanted to
    shrink the government, but because he believed in liberty, and the value of individuals,
    it would have never occurred to him to kill groups to get there. And so, I think
    evil is basically ignorance, and has absolutely nothing to do with sincerity.

    nothing to do with it. Ignorance, as any educated person knows, is not confined
    to the underclass. Many smart people adopt a paranoid worldview that makes them
    evil.

    worth hundreds of millions of dollars, who treat individuals as means to an end,
    and wish to make examples out of them based on some paranoid principle. These
    people are clearly sociopaths, but I feel no pity for them, any more than I feel
    pity for violent rapists because they are obviously mentally unhinged. It is their
    victims who deserve our support; sociopaths, especially ones of means, need disincentives,
    not more group hugs. They have enough enablers telling them that their behavior
    is somehow reasonable (all on the hope of getting some of the power or money from
    such rich people).

    wealthy sociopaths. But what about those in a position to help, but choose to
    do nothing? As Abraham Lincoln said, 'Nearly all men can stand adversity, but
    if you want to test a man’s character, give him power'. And so, most cubicle slaves
    aren't in a position to manifest any sociopathic qualities. But many are given
    small opportunities, that are like little 'tells' in poker, and give away a moral
    emptiness.

    has, I think, a duty to act, because choosing to do nothing is a choice. Further,
    when the choice merely asks one to behave reasonably, to espouse the truth, the
    'risks' are always there but are small, not like asking someone to jump into a
    race riot to save their lone buddy.

    courage. But intellectual courage is called upon, and generally journalists and
    educators prop up the heroes of the past and say, I would have been behind Galileo
    or Ruby Bridges. Who wouldn't? The real question is, if you saw someone getting
    railroaded, would you stand up and say, to someone important in the process, this
    is not right, knowing that you would incur the wrath of the powerful instigator?
    Unfortunately, most people, even seemingly very religious, and empathetic people,
    do not.

    have always been like this.' Most people are intellectual cowards, that is, are
    afraid of reprobation, or making enemies in social circles. My kids learn about
    Civil Rights constantly, as if this is to teach them courage, but learning about
    courage this way is very misleading, because we have a case where there was a
    bad thing that is no longer defended by anyone sane. So to teach courage via this
    tale is like teaching about scientific courage by pointing to the idiocy of the
    flat-earthers. I think a better education would be to look at Hitler, and see,
    OK, he needed a pretext to arouse the masses, and the Jews were good. Why? Because
    they were unsypmathetic. Why? They were disproportionately successful. Why is
    that sufficient? Because they were depersonalized, rationalized via social Darwinism,
    etc. That would be much more informative than merely saying that those in favor
    of allowing blacks to enroll in white schools were right. My boys learn about
    a caricature of evil in school, they don't learn the real thing, and I see the
    moral effect this has on current adults--they have learned, or become, nothing.
    Hopefully, my kids won't experience evil, but as Flaubert noted, it's as probable
    as ever.
