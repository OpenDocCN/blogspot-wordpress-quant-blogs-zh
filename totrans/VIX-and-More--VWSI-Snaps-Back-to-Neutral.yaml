    Mean Reversion,” last week would be a classic case study.  After soaring 75% in
    the week ended March 2^(nd), the VIX snapped back 24% this week, so that it now
    sits comfortably between its 10 and 20 day SMAs.

- en: Perhaps surprising to some, this 24% drop is still less of a move than the VIX
    drops in each of the three previous instances in which the VIX Weekly Sentiment
    Indicator (VWSI) was at -10, as I discussed [last week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/03/vwsi-at-10.html).  It
    is enough of a move, however, for the current week’s VWSI to return to a neutral
    reading of zero.  This roughly translates as the odds times the magnitude of another
    VIX spike are about the same as the odds times the magnitude of continued subsidence
    over the coming week.  Said another way, there is a higher probability that the
    VIX will be lower on March 16, *but* if the VIX makes a significant move in the
    coming week, that move is more likely to be up than down.

    the spike strategy](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/02/four-ways-to-play-vix-options-following.html),
    this looks like a good time to start taking those profits.  Keep in mind, however,
    that the VIX has a [tendency to drop](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/01/vix-performance-during-options.html)
    during options expiration.  With the 10 day SMA of total put to call ratio currently
    sitting at 1.28, you can safely assume that it will need a [Sherpa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherpa)
    to stay at that altitude, suggesting that the market is poised to move upward
    and the VIX may have another leg down this week.

    apply to the VIX, not to the broader markets, which are usually negatively correlated
    with the VIX.)
