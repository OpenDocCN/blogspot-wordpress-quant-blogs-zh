    or discretionary trading), we need to establish knowledge. A theory explains how
    and why something occurs. Testing of historical data can help us conduct limited,
    targeted tests to determine whether our theory holds up in practice. Before we
    test, we must formulate a plausible hypothesis. There is no theoretical or practical
    rationale why many strategies in technical analysis, fundamental analysis, or
    random combinations of quantitative variables should be valid.
