- en: Tactical approaches are often chosen based on the best cumulative return which
    implicitly incorporates significant hindsight bias.  Just because an approach
    dominates for a period of time does not indicate that it will be the best approach. 
    As the investment community abandons buy-and-hold and embraces tactical allocation,
    my guess is that the best cumulative return gathers the most assets.

    cumulative returns with significantly less risk regardless of risk measure.  Let’s
    play with degrees of freedom and make slight changes to the system to see how
    they performed in the past.  Let’s then try to decide which approach we should
    pursue in the future given very incomplete information.  Once we decide, let’s
    then decide how confident we can be in the future result.

    hedge fund indexes](http://tradeblotter.wordpress.com/2012/06/04/download-and-parse-edhec-hedge-fund-indexes/),
    we can visualize the cumulative returns and drawdowns of each approach.  I have
    denoted with a line 1985 which is a time when we might have chosen approach #2
    since it offered significantly better cumulative returns from 1950-1985.  However,
    the result after our 1985 choice was not as good as we would have expected.'

    we can use some more sophisticated measure of risk.  The middle (MovAvgSharpe
    or approach #2) offers the lowest level of historical risk on a cumulative basis. 
    Even though performance lagged since its 1985 first place finish, this might encourage
    us to still pick this approach.'

    can check the distribution of the monthly changes and also some higher-moment
    statistics skewness and kurtosis.

    we might use ttrTests (explained in posts [http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/search/label/ttrTests](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/search/label/ttrTests
    "http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/search/label/ttrTests")), use random portfolios
    as advocated and explained very well by [http://portfolioprobe.com](http://portfolioprobe.com),
    and/or let relative strength decide as advocated and explained very well by [http://systematicrelativestrength.com/](http://systematicrelativestrength.com/
    "http://systematicrelativestrength.com/").  However in 30 years, we have no idea
    what will do best or even what best means.
