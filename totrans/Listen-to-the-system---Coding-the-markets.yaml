    My hope is to remind myself to read the error messages, and examine the symptoms, 
    without preconceptions. Often, when debugging, there is a eureka moment, when
    we figure the root cause of the problem. At that point we realise that we’ve ignored
    error messages that didn’t fit with our early guesses at the nature of the problem.

    and try to keep an open mind as to causes and consequences as they observe price
    action.
