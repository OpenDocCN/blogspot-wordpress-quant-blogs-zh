    the capital ratios is probably a good idea, given the 'too big to fail' implicit
    guarantee on bank debt implies huge option value to the equity owners, and no
    default risk for the debt owners, this is better than doing only 'too big to fail'.

    and market risk are completely understood by insiders and outsiders of the firm.
    Their measure of capital implies an increase in return on capital simply by bringing
    all firms under one big legal entity, as in this case profits would be strictly
    additive while capital would benefit from the diversification benefits. The empirical
    contrast, in the form of many firms in equilibrium, implies that they are missing
    something big.

- en: One way to see that capital is not merely a cushion for hard times, is to consider
    the following example. Assume a goose lays an average of 100 golden eggs a year,
    normally distributed with mean 100, stdev of 10\. The annualized discount rate
    is 10%, making the present value of this goose is $1,000 (100/.1).

    default is 1%?

- en: A 1% adverse production over a year is a 76.7 eggs, so lending such that an
    interest rate of 10% generates that kind of interest payment implies that a 767
    in debt would be paid each year by the eggs, with a 1% chance of failure.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But if only 76 eggs were produced one year, meaning the goose owner could not
    pay his interest with cashflow, that same equity owner could easily borrow 1 egg
    based on his equity collateral, and stave off bankruptcy. The cashflow loss would
    have to be improbably large to overcome this obvious solution by the equity owner.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is the variability in the present value of the cash flows that is relevant,
    because there is basically no scenario that would wipe out the present value of
    the equity owner so much that he could not borrow to pay off his debt if he had
    debt of $767\. So now, assume the

    deviation of cash flows is now zero. Assuming the 1-period liability holders demand
    a 1% annualized default rate. With 100 as the mean number of eggs, and a 10 as
    the standard deviation of the mean, the liability holder is willing to finance
    this goose with 767 in debt (if the mean falls by 23.3, a 1% chance). But say
    the mean number of eggs falls to 76, and so the new present value is 760\. The
    equity owner now has a book value of -7\. Is that bankruptcy?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Certainly not. Even in this case, the equity owner can, if he can produce 7
    eggs, still maintain equity interest, and thus control over future revenues. If
    the return next period goes up 57 eggs, he gains 500 in equity value, if it loses
    any more eggs, he is worth zero. The equity owner has an incentive to borrow small
    amounts until this position becomes untenable, and he does this mainly by arguing
    that the prospective mean value is not really 767, but something higher, and bank
    executives are fundamentally salesmen. So the key issue is not the change in eggs,
    but that the change in eggs is not so large that the option value is so out of
    the money that equity owners are unable to pull this trick on debtholders.

    able to game this until the value of the asset is 50% of the nominal liability.
    This implies such financial wrangling is common in sinking enterprises, who only
    'fail' when outsiders stop buying their excuses (almost all failed companies,
    according to insiders, only needed 'a little more time').

    risk capital. Sure it is related, but very indirectly. How much would Citigroup
    have to lose for it to default? That very much depends on the type of loss. If
    the loss seems a one-timer, this won’t affect the expected returns going forward.
    If there seems a secular trend in their business such that the current loss is
    the tip of the iceberg, a small loss is sufficient, and debtholders are just salivating
    for a legal pretext to grab the assets, chop the company up, and sell it in parts.

    to future default rates when you look at banks cross-sectionally (excluding the
    obvious cases where you are measuring leverage less than 6 months from failure,
    which is too late to affect anything). I think this is for two reasons. First,
    historically industry considered regulatory minimums too high, and so all banks
    had very clustered leverage ratios close to the regulatory minimum, making it
    hard to distinguish bad from good. Secondly, shocks to banks occur so episodically,
    in such radically different forms, so bankers tend to under provision for them

    survivorship bias within banking, where everyone in charge pre-2008 had never
    experienced more than a couple percent draw-down. Sure, energy lending got whacked
    in the 1980's, commercial real-estate in 1990, and there were others, but that
