    the capital ratios is probably a good idea, given the 'too big to fail' implicit
    guarantee on bank debt implies huge option value to the equity owners, and no
    default risk for the debt owners, this is better than doing only 'too big to fail'.

- en: Certainly not. Even in this case, the equity owner can, if he can produce 7
    eggs, still maintain equity interest, and thus control over future revenues. If
    the return next period goes up 57 eggs, he gains 500 in equity value, if it loses
    any more eggs, he is worth zero. The equity owner has an incentive to borrow small
    amounts until this position becomes untenable, and he does this mainly by arguing
    that the prospective mean value is not really 767, but something higher, and bank
    executives are fundamentally salesmen. So the key issue is not the change in eggs,
    but that the change in eggs is not so large that the option value is so out of
    the money that equity owners are unable to pull this trick on debtholders.

  zh: 当然不是。即使在这种情况下，股权所有者仍然可以在下一期生产7个鸡蛋的情况下保持股权利益，并因此控制未来收入。如果下一期的回报增加了57个鸡蛋，他将获得500的股权价值，如果损失了更多鸡蛋，他的价值为零。股权所有者有动力借入少量资金，直到这个位置不堪一击，他主要通过辩称预期均值实际上并非767，而是更高一些，银行高层主要是推销员来做到这一点。因此，关键问题不是鸡蛋的变动，而是鸡蛋的变动并不是那么大，以至于期权价值已经跌得无法挽回，使股权所有者无法拿这个把戏去忽悠债权人。

    have to lose for it to default? That very much depends on the type of loss. If
    the loss seems a one-timer, this won’t affect the expected returns going forward.
    If there seems a secular trend in their business such that the current loss is
    the tip of the iceberg, a small loss is sufficient, and debtholders are just salivating
