> 来源：[http://epchan.blogspot.com/2009/08/interview-on-backtesting.html#0001-01-01](http://epchan.blogspot.com/2009/08/interview-on-backtesting.html#0001-01-01)

I have given a 2-part interview (

and

[here](http://www.tradingmarkets.com/.site/stocks/commentary/satinterview/Bias-Free-Backtesting-Part-2-The-Big-Saturday-Inte-81893.cfm)

) on the various nuances of backtesting on tradingmarkets.com. Most of the ideas have been covered in my

[book](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0470284889?tag=quantitativet-20&camp=14573&creative=327641&linkCode=as1&creativeASIN=0470284889&adid=1N7NV58ARV4DQ57S534B&)

, but it does serve as a summary of what I consider to be the most important issues.

For those of you who are interested, I may be giving a workshop on general techniques in backtesting in London as well, in addition to my

. Additional details will be available on epchan.com at a later date.
