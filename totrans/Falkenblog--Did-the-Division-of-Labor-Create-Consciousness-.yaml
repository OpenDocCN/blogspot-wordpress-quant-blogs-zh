- en: one's power and pleasure.  Real satisfaction in life often comes from advancing
    such higher purposes, imagined though they may be. There are many potential whys,
    such as helping the tribe, a king with supernatural powers, some god, and they
    all involve theories about how the means relate to the end, and some argument
    why the end is right and true.  When we didn't have choices, we didn't have to
    think about our purpose in life and probably didn't have a philosophy on life.
    It's unfortunate that modern society creates anxieties that our primitive ancestors
    did not have simply because they were often acting out of necessity or some inviolable
    tradition, but developing a healthy purpose in life when you can actually choose
    is a real advance in the intellectual history of humans. As with most thoughts

    to the industrial revolution, but also to the strange fact that humans think about
    thinking, meaning, and a sense of self.  The division of labor didn''t create
    consciousness, but it did make us ask why we do what we do, and so lead to a higher
