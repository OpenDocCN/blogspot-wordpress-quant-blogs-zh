    an afternoon selloff. The Dow and S&P 500 lost all of their gains but the Nasdaq
    went virtually unscathed, with the Nasdaq 100 finishing over 1% higher. I looked

    spiking just as sharply or more so even though this selloff is more benign. That
    is generally a good thing.

    tend to react to that report more severely than most.
