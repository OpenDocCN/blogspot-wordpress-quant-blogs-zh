- en: For active traders top-ranked Livermore Index stock Biogen (BIIB)  is creeping
    up to make a decisive breakout that could eventually reach recent  long-term resistance
    at around $70 if it is successful. It would appear that a $55.50-$56.50 price
    would be a target for purchase with an 8-10% stop leaving an attractive reward/risk
    setup. [http://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui](http://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui)
