# Magmasystems Blog: Vhayu and Aite redux

> 来源：[http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2008/05/vhayu-and-aite-redux.html#0001-01-01](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2008/05/vhayu-and-aite-redux.html#0001-01-01)

Our friend Ross Dubin from Vhayu has sent a reassuring message:

*Vhayu paid for a research report to be written by Aite. Aite insists on maintaining neutrality in the research and it includes mention of our direct competitors, Kx and OneTick as well as our indirect competitors who handle real-time data analysis, StreamBase, Apama, Aleri, etc. Sang is going to cover the highlights of the research paper during the webcast. That's where his role ends.*

Also, our friends from Aleri sent a note to tell me that they are well aware of the lawsuit surrounding Exegy, and that Aleri is well protected from any negative outcomes.

Good news on both fronts.
