# VIX and More: VIX:VXV Ratio Slips Below 0.92 Intraday

Several factors have contributed to my taking a more bearish stance today, including a [VIX:VXV ratio](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%3AVXV) of 0.92, up from a low of 0.919 a little earlier.

Among the ways to get long volatility in this environment of rapidly falling volatility is [VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX), the short-term VIX ETN, which looks like an attractive long at the current at 74.79.
