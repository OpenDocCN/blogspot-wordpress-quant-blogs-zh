    but an attempt to replace the recent bubble with yet another*** - to drive already
    overvalued risky assets to further overvaluation in hopes that consumers will
    view the "wealth" as permanent. The problem here is that unlike housing, which
    consumers had viewed as immune from major price declines, investors have observed
    two separate stock market plunges of over 50% each, within the past decade alone.
    While investors have obviously demonstrated an aptitude for ignoring risk over
    short periods of time, it is a simple fact that raising the price of a risky asset
    comes at the sacrifice of lower long-term returns, except when there is a proportional
    increase in the long-term stream cash flows that can be expected from the security.'

    that can be expected to deliver commensurately lower long-term returns, leaving
    their lifetime "wealth" unaffected, but exposing them to enormous risk of price
    declines over the intermediate (2-5 year) horizon. This is not a basis on which
    consumers are likely to shift their spending patterns. What Bernanke doesn't seem
    to absorb is that stocks are nothing but a claim on a long-term stream of cash
    flows that investors expect to be delivered over time. Propping up the price of
    stocks changes the distribution of long-term investment returns, but it doesn't
    materially affect the cash flows. This reckless policy has done nothing but to
    promote further overvaluation of already overvalued assets. The current Shiller
    P/E above 22 has historically been associated with subsequent total returns in
    the S&P 500 of less than 5% annually, on average, over every investment horizon
    shorter than a decade.

    the past decade, rising from RMB 12 to 70 trillion. Every currency has experienced
    depreciation after a pronged bout of money growth. China's industry has risen
    tremendously to justify part of the growth. However, a massive amount is in the
    overvalued property market. When it normalizes, the money flows out and the currency
    depreciation pressure happens. We should see this within two years.

    the American consumer's already weakened spending power. (Oh I forgot, central
    bankers look at inflation ex-food and energy, which is where the inflation is,
    so therefore there won't be any inflationary effect...)
