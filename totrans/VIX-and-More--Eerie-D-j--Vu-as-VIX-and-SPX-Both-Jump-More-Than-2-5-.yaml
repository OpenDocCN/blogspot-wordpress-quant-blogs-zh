    lows. As it turns out, November 27^(th), which I have indicated with a purple
    arrow in the chart below, was just two days before an intermediate high which
    preceded a 17.3% drop that led to the final bottom process some 3 ½ months later.
    From this point, the markets began to rally and were bullish for more than four
    years.

    In that year, the bear market associated with the dot com meltdown bottomed first
    in July and then again in October, where it hit 768\. From that October low, the
    market rallied to 939 on November 27^(th) – numbers that are strikingly similar
    to the November 2008 low and the subsequent January 2009 high.
