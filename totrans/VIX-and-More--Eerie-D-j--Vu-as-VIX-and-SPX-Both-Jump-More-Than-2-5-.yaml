    you probably saw my surprise when I asked rhetorically, “When is the last time
    the VIX was making new intraday highs with the $DJIA up 230?”

    I did check to see if today’s close set a record for greatest percentage gains
    by both the VIX (+3.87%) and the SPX (+2.58%) on the same day.

    back on November 27, 2002, which was the day before Thanksgiving. On that day,
    the VIX was up 4.93% and the SPX gained 2.80%.

    lows. As it turns out, November 27^(th), which I have indicated with a purple
    arrow in the chart below, was just two days before an intermediate high which
    preceded a 17.3% drop that led to the final bottom process some 3 ½ months later.
    From this point, the markets began to rally and were bullish for more than four
    years.

    In that year, the bear market associated with the dot com meltdown bottomed first
    in July and then again in October, where it hit 768\. From that October low, the
    market rallied to 939 on November 27^(th) – numbers that are strikingly similar
    to the November 2008 low and the subsequent January 2009 high.

    before stocks rallied and never looked back.

    still has (at least) one more sharp drop in it…or does the current situation bear
    a closer resemblance to the May 2003 beginning of a new bull market?

    jumps, the day that comes next closest to today and November 27 is May 11, 1990\.
    At that time, stocks were in a bullish uptrend that would continue for another
    two months, before being interrupted by a 19.8% drop that would last from July
    to October of that year.
