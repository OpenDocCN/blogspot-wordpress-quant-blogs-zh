    know that you are insolvent but we stand ready to backstop you and inject sufficient
    equity to recapitalize you. If you take our option, then the shareholders will
    get diluted to virtually zero and bondholders will have to take haircuts. Management
    will get replaced. No depositor funds will get lost. This plan is not mandatory.

    an upper bound for re-capitalizing eurozone banks to be in the order of  €700-800
    billion. Not all banks will need re-capitalization nor do they all need all of
    their Tier 1 capital replaced, so ***the current size of the EFSF may be sufficiently
    large for such an operation***.

    a managed default by Greece but for the country to remain within the eurozone.
    Under the plan, private sector creditors would bear a loss of as much as 50pc
    – more than double the 21pc proposal currently on the table. A new bail-out programme
    would then be devised for Greece.

    If they can't get that agreed on on day dot (and Merkel and the German constitutional

    go the Argentine route and let the rest of Europe fend for themselves.
