    hedge via a deep in the money (DITM) option on GE, say a Jan 2010 $2.50 call (GEWAS).
    Given the option contract multiplier of 100, 1 GEWAS contract is required per
    100 shares. Thus, a single option in this example.

    complexities for brevity), the [option greeks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks_%28finance%29)
    ([delta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks_%28finance%29#Delta) and [gamma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks_%28finance%29#Gamma),
    in particular; [vega](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks_%28finance%29#Vega)
    is zero in this example, so conveniently ignored) indicate GEWAS should increase
    very nearly $1 for every $1 decrease by GE.

- en: 'To satisfy the cash requirement from above, the call option should be sold
    short: when GE decreases in value, the short call option must increase in value.
    Most recent midpoint close quote for GEWAS is $14.05, thus shorting 1 GEWAS generates
    $14.05 in cash for each share—for a total of $1,405 in this example (less transaction
    costs).'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Thus, the equity trader can solve this problem by shorting a single option contract
    (-1 GEWAS), use the $1,405 proceeds to execute the desired short-term trade, and
    then buy the option back (thus, generating the P&L to match the underlying change
    in GE which occurs in the meantime) once the short-term trade is closed.

- en: 'One caveat: if GE consistently decreases in price, this hedge will need to
    be closed or dynamically adjusted. This adjustment becomes required because the
    option delta/gamma decreases away from 1 as GE decreases. For example, if GE decreases
    to $2.50 (GEWAS strike price), then the option becomes [at the money](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyness#ATM:_At-the-money)
    (ATM) and thus delta is 0.5\. As such, this hedge should be closed or adjusted
    well in advance of GE price decreasing to approach this strike price.'
