    of no one''s fault, but rather, when people do things that seemingly are intended

    control that, you take their slights without offense. You still have to manage
    them, but you don't let these people anger you. Somehow, thinking about other's
    intentions raises hackles much more than any non-conscious constraints. This makes
    you more effective, and more pleasant to work with, because one of the most endearing
    qualities is someone with a thick skin.

    amounts of win. One must not merely love a select few people, but work with many
    one is much less fond of in a productive way. Modern life is intrinsically social,
    so either teach people or endure them. Accepting the sad fact that every day,
    some of our interactions will involve petty insults and slights, sometimes by
    colleagues and bosses, is much more constructive than either mooning about it
    (realism) or thinking it doesn't happen (optimism). If you replace annoying people's
    intent with poorly endowed assumptions or logic, an inanimate obstacle, it is
    not merely more fruitful but less stressful. Your lack of drama will be appreciated
    by those around you, even those who really don't like you, and winning them over
    is a good thing.
