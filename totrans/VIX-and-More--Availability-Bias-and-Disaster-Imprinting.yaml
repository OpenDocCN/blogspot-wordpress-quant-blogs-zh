- en: After I dashed off [The VIX Spike Conundrum](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/11/vix-spike-conundrum.html),
    it occurred to me that there might be some aspects of [behavioral finance](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/behavioral%20finance)
    that have contributed to what is now a full year of continued overestimating of
    future volatility. I detailed this phenomenon in [The Gap Between the VIX and
    Realized Volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/08/gap-between-vix-and-realized-volatility.html)
    and is also being reflected in up in a [VIX:VXV ratio](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%3AVXV)
    that has been stuck at unusually low levels from mid-July until last week.

    decision-making and could contribute to excess implied volatility, one factor
    that immediately comes to mind is [availability bias](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/availability%20bias)
    ([nicely summarized in Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic).)
    The global financial crisis and VIX spikes into the 80s were so vivid and memorable
    – and so thoroughly discussed in the media – that they are all too easy to recall
    one year later, even though arguably most of the risks associated with a VIX of
    80 have since passed.

    implied volatility. My working hypothesis – which I do not believe has been addressed
    by the behavioral finance crowd – is that another factor is as work. I call it
    “[disaster imprinting](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/disaster%20imprinting)”
    for lack of a better name. Disaster imprinting refers to a phenomenon in which
    the threats of financial and psychological disaster were so severe that they continue
    to leave a permanent or semi-permanent scar in one’s psyche. Another way to describe
    disaster imprinting might be to liken it to a low level financial post-traumatic
    stress disorder.

    for now I wanted to throw the idea out and see what others think. Has going to
    the brink of a global financial meltdown impaired our collective ability to assess
    future probabilities? If so, how long will this impairment last? As always, all
    comments are appreciated.
