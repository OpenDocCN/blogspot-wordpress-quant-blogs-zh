- en: After I dashed off [The VIX Spike Conundrum](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/11/vix-spike-conundrum.html),
    it occurred to me that there might be some aspects of [behavioral finance](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/behavioral%20finance)
    that have contributed to what is now a full year of continued overestimating of
    future volatility. I detailed this phenomenon in [The Gap Between the VIX and
    Realized Volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/08/gap-between-vix-and-realized-volatility.html)
    and is also being reflected in up in a [VIX:VXV ratio](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%3AVXV)
    that has been stuck at unusually low levels from mid-July until last week.

  zh: 在我草草写下[VIX冲天迷局](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/11/vix-spike-conundrum.html)之后，我意识到行为金融学派可能有一些方面对现在持续一年的高估未来波动有贡献。我在[VIX与实际波动之间的差距](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/08/gap-between-vix-and-realized-volatility.html)中详细描述了这一现象，这也反映在上周从七月半到上周一直保持在异常低水平的[VIX:VXV比率](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%3AVXV)中。
- en: In thinking about the various elements of behavioral finance that impair ‘rational’
    decision-making and could contribute to excess implied volatility, one factor
    that immediately comes to mind is [availability bias](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/availability%20bias)
    ([nicely summarized in Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic).)
    The global financial crisis and VIX spikes into the 80s were so vivid and memorable
    – and so thoroughly discussed in the media – that they are all too easy to recall
    one year later, even though arguably most of the risks associated with a VIX of
    80 have since passed.

  zh: 在思考行为金融学的各种因素，这些因素损害了“理性”决策并可能对隐含波动造成过度的影响时，立即出现在脑海中的一个因素是[可得性偏见](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/availability%20bias)（在维基百科上有[很好的总结](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic)）。全球金融危机和VIX冲到80s的记忆是如此鲜明和难忘——并且在媒体上彻底讨论过——以至于一年后很容易回忆起来，尽管可以说与VIX
    80相关的绝大多数风险自那以后已经过去。
- en: I do not think that availability bias is the only explanation for recent excess
    implied volatility. My working hypothesis – which I do not believe has been addressed
    by the behavioral finance crowd – is that another factor is as work. I call it
    “[disaster imprinting](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/disaster%20imprinting)”
    for lack of a better name. Disaster imprinting refers to a phenomenon in which
    the threats of financial and psychological disaster were so severe that they continue
    to leave a permanent or semi-permanent scar in one’s psyche. Another way to describe
    disaster imprinting might be to liken it to a low level financial post-traumatic
    stress disorder.

  zh: 我不认为可得性偏见是近期隐含波动过度的唯一解释。我的工作假设是——我认为行为金融学派尚未解决这个问题——还有另一个因素在起作用。我暂时称之为“[灾难印记](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/disaster%20imprinting)”缺乏一个更好的名字。灾难印记是指一种现象，即金融和心理灾难的威胁如此严重，以至于它们在人们的心理上留下永久的或半永久的疤痕。描述灾难印记的另一方式可能是将其比作一种低级别的金融创伤后应激障碍。
- en: I will do some additional research to test the disaster imprinting theory, but
    for now I wanted to throw the idea out and see what others think. Has going to
    the brink of a global financial meltdown impaired our collective ability to assess
    future probabilities? If so, how long will this impairment last? As always, all
    comments are appreciated.

  zh: 我会做一些额外的研究来测试灾难印记理论，但目前我想提出这个想法，看看其他人怎么想。濒临全球金融崩溃边缘是否损害了我们对未来概率的集体评估能力？如果是这样，这种损害会持续多久？和往常一样，所有评论都受到重视。
