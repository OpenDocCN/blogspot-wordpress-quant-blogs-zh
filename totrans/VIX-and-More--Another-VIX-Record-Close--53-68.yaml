    a new mark of 53.68 today.

- en: For most of today's session, yesterday's VIX record looked safe, until a flurry
    of selling in the last half hour lifted the VIX to a new end of day high. Today
    is the third record close for the VIX in the last seven sessions. Also of interest,
    today's intra-day high of 54.19 was the second highest on record, behind yesterday's
    58.24 mark.

    moving average of 24.87, yet another VIX record.'
