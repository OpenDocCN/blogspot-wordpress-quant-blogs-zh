- en: I am straddling two positions at the moment. I am still at my current position
    as SVP of Equity Derivatives at my company, but I am also doing a slow transition
    to the Derivatives Analytics desk on the business side. So, for the latter role,
    I have been sitting on the massive Equities trading floor at my company.

- en: The contract in the physical difference in the two roles is stark. In my position
    in Architecture, I sit in a big office in an old Lucent campus in the middle of
    North/Central New Jersey, about 35 miles from Allentown, Pa. The place is almost
    like a morgue ... I could go there, sit in my office, and not see anyone for an
    entire day.

    This is not your father's Tribeca. You have 20 gourmet restaurants within two
    blocks of my office. You can look out the 20-foot windows that overlook the Hudson
    River and see the Statue of Liberty. You can see pretty girls walking across the
    floor all day long.

- en: When I am sitting at the Derivatives Analytics quant desk, there is the amazing
    energy that accompanies a trading floor. I was lucky enough to be on the floor
    for these last two trading days, where the Dow dropped 500 points. There was cheering,
    shouting, tension, madness. It reminded me of the old days, when I started out
    on Wall Street as a consultant for Goldman Sachs, and then went to consult for
    Drexel Burnham. In those days, we developing the first cut of Windows-based trading
    workstations, so we would always get traders who looked over our shoulders, commenting
    on our work.

- en: It has been no secret that I am fascinated with the quant world. I am sitting
    with truly brilliant people who talk a different language that I barely understand.
    Even though the quants at my desk are 50% Russian, they talk in English, throwing
    around terms like Kurtosis and Skew Risk, terms which have me madly scrambling
    to Google. Terms which may me wish that I had not shown up drunk to Statistics
    101 class every day in college!

- en: It is interesting to have these quants coming up to me, apologizing for their
    code. Maybe I can teach them a little bit about software and architecture, and
    they can teach me how to Delta Hedge my portfolios!
