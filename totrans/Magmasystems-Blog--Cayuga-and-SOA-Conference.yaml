- en: . It's a CEP engine, it comes with source code, and it's free. Unfortunately,
    my megabank needs a full ecosystem, and the support model of an actual company,
    so this disqualifies Cayuga from further consideration. However, it would be interesting
    to see if the Cayuga people go off and form a commercial venture around this.

- en: The SOA/WebServices panel was a success. Thanks to Tom Steinthal for inviting
    me to participate. A lot of the crowd was interested in CEP and the interaction
    of CEP and SOA. After the panel discussion, I was mobbed by a lot of vendors...
    something that I explicitly wanted to avoid. I would rather have been mobbed my
    my bank's competitors to engage in some general information sharing. I am very
    curious to see if CEP has moved out of the very "linear" world of algo trading
    and pricing.
