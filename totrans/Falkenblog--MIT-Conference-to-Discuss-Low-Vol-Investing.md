# Falkenblog: MIT Conference to Discuss Low Vol Investing

Next Friday, March 9, there's going to be an

[MIT Sloan Investment Management Conference](http://www.mitsloaninvestment.com/Conference-Agenda.html)

, over in Cambridge MA. It's pretty cheap (~$100), and you can register

. Makes me a little jealous of people who live near Megacities like Boston, New York City, or Chicago, where all the Bloomberg terminals exist, because such things are so much more frequent. I'll be a discussant there on Low Volatility Strategies, and I'm hoping for some vigorous disagreement between various factions in the way that families often fight more than strangers.
