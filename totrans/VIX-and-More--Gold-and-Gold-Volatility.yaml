    has received considerable attention as a safe haven investment. The rush into
    gold was greatly exacerbated when investors began to lose confidence in money
    market funds following the ‘[breaking of the buck](http://www.cnn.com/2008/BUSINESS/09/17/money.fund.ap/index.html)’
    at Reserve Primary Fund last Tuesday.

    and anxiety in the financial markets and gold is trading at its highest level
    in almost two months.

    the most popular gold ETF, along with [GVZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/GVZ),
    the CBOE’s gold volatility index (or Gold VIX) which was [launched back on August
    1^(st)](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/08/evolution-of-volatility-index-family.html)
    and is based on GLD.

    oil volatility index), there has generally been a positive correlation between
    the price of gold and gold volatility index. Note that in early August, the correlation
    between GLD and GVZ switched from positive to negative, as gold volatility began
    to rise even as gold prices declined. On about September 11^(th), however, the
    correlation between GLD and GVZ swung back to a strong positive one, where it
    has held for the past two weeks. It may just be a coincidence that this switch
    in correlation occurred just before a week of extreme financial panic, but I wanted
    to at least plant that seed and note that I will be following these and other
    related subjects as I evaluate some of the [new volatility indices](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/08/evolution-of-volatility-index-family.html)
    in this space going forward.
