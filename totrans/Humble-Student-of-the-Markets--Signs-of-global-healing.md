# Humble Student of the Markets: Signs of global healing

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2013/03/signs-of-global-healing.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2013/03/signs-of-global-healing.html#0001-01-01)

In addition to the upside surprise shown by

[US February retail sales](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-13/retail-sales-in-u-s-rose-in-february-by-most-in-five-months.html)

yesterday, I am seeing additional signs of global economic healing. South Korean exports, which are highly cyclically sensitive, are turning up (via

[Business Insider](http://www.businessinsider.com/chart-korean-exports-2013-3)

):

As well, the

[OECD reported](http://www.dw.de/oecd-sees-signs-of-emerging-eurozone-growth/a-16664294)

on Monday that it was seeing signs of emerging growth in the eurozone, with (surprise!) Germany as the engine:

> Economic growth was beginning to re-emerge in the 17-nation euro currency area, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said as it released key economic indicators Monday.
> 
> The recovery in Europe's biggest economy, Germany, had pushed up an OECD indicator for the eurozone designed to identify turning points in the business cycle, said the organization, which represents senior Western industrialized nations.

The economic clouds are lifting and such an environment is supportive of further gains in equities (see my last post

).
