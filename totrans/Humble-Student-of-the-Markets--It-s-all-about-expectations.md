Fast forward a month. The company unveiled its new chip and the market reaction was a thud. In fact, the AI bellwether Semiconductor Index weakened and violated a relative uptrend channel (bottom panel). This was a lesson in expectations, how the market reacted to incoming data, and how expectations evolve.
