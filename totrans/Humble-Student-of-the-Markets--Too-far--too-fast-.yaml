    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    a Depression if you lose your job. In other words, economic weakness is only academic
    until it hits home. The denizens of New York City and Wall Street were jolted
    last week when the MTA, which operates the NYC subway and commuter services Metro-North
    and Long Island Rail Road, announced that it may need to dramatically cut services
    in the absence of fiscal support. The MTA proposed laying off 9,000 employees
    and cuts to transit services of 40-50%.

    recovery is not all rainbows and unicorns. In addition, the decision by the US
    Treasury to end a series of emergency CARES Act support programs raises the risk
    to state and local organizations like the MTA.
