    with [my last post on horizon charts](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2012/07/application-of-horizon-plots.html).
    I thought it might be helpful to quickly provide an overview on horizon charts.
    Since I am not a visualization expert, I will try to compile the best examples
    and tutorials that I have found. At the end, I will do a step by step walkthrough
    of the construction of a horizon chart in R.

    the construction of a horizon chart from an area chart.  I have embedded it below

    for the full example from the original source).

    very nice job explaining construction.  If you learn better from reading, a [short
    paper from Hannes Reijner of Panopticon Software](http://www.stonesc.com/Vis08_Workshop/DVD/Reijner_submission.pdf)
    covers the same material.

- en: We found that dividing a chart into layered bands reliably increased estimation
    time and increased estimation error at constant chart heights. However, we also
    found that 2-band mirrored charts led to better estimation accuracies for chart
    heights less than 24 pixels (6.8 mm on our displays). For larger chart sizes,
    we advise scaling 1-band mirrored charts.  For smaller sizes, we advise adding
    layered bands.

- en: If we use yesterday’s example of a 200 day moving average system where you enter
    when above the moving average and exit when below, we might like to see a standard
    time series plot like this one.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In a simple world with only one asset or stock, this might be sufficient.  However,
    we probably will have multiple instruments that we would like to monitor, and
    dedicating this much height per instrument will require lots of space.  Ideally,
    we could condense each of these plots, so that we could see many at a time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the first step toward condensing, we could extract just the information that
    is most meaningful, which I consider to be the percent above or below the moving
    average.
  prefs: []

- en: We might then try an area chart to better depict above or below 0.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I’m sure you are wondering though when we will start reducing height and saving
    space.  We could start by changing all the negative values to positive values,
    and add color to represent positive or negative.  This means we cut our chart
    height by about 1/2.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, we need much more efficiency, so let’s separate the chart into bands.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    them to save space?  Let’s look at each band separately.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Notice that similar to a heat map, the band colors increase in intensity and
    opaqueness as their values increase. If we layer each band on top of each other,
    we get a horizon plot, and we can reduce the original chart by 1/6 or even more
    without significant loss of information.

    If nothing else, maybe you will have learned some lattice techniques in R.
