    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    signal. A bullish Trend Model signal that gets less bullish is a trading "sell"
    signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading
    "buy" signal. The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of
    the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. Past trading of
    the trading model has shown turnover rates of about 200% per month.

    are most influencing their six-month outlook for stocks. Nearly three-quarters
    of respondents (73%) cited national politics, particularly President Donald Trump’s
    polices and what actions Congress may take. Tax reform was mentioned by many (20%
    of respondents), followed by regulatory reform and uncertainty over what legislation
    will actually be passed. Just under 23% of all respondents listed the ongoing
    rally and the prevailing stock valuations, with several of these respondents expressing
    concerns about the level of valuations or that a drop could be forthcoming. Monetary
    policy was cited by 8% of all respondents, followed by corporate earnings growth
    (7%) and investor sentiment (7%). Some respondents listed more than one factor.
