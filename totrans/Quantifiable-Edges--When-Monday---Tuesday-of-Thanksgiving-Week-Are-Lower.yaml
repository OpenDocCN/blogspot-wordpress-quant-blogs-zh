    on both Wednesday and Friday.  Interesting about the current week  is that both
    Monday and Tuesday have closed down in the SPX.  Going back to 1961 I looked at
    performance on Wed through Fri after Mon and Tues were lower.  There were only
    eight other instances.  They are listed below.

    short-term bullish case.
