    highs. The chart below of the relative performance of the Morgan Stanley Cyclical
    Index (CYC) show that cyclical stocks have definitively broken down out of a relative
    uptrend. Up until recently, it could be argued that the relative uptrend was a
    little wobbly but remained intact. The latest technical verdict from last week's
    market action was clear. No matter how you manipulate the trend line, the technical
    break was unmistakable.
