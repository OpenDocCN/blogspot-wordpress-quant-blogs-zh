    presentation and demos for the up and coming Leveraging Technology to Drive Customer
    [Connections](https://msevents.microsoft.com/cui/EventDetail.aspx?culture=en-US&EventID=1032446115&IO=Y1Gb7M7t4CoDKB2h/PKaYw%3d%3d).
    I do think the AppFabric Caching Real-Time Market Risk demo is cool, its just
    unfortunate that I suspect the slides and time will not do it justice.

- en: Dryad. I‚Äôve had the samples on my machine for about 4 weeks now, and have yet
    to spend enough time looking at them. Generally from the HPC work that has already
    been done from a Market Risk cashflow perspective, Microsoft need to spend more
    time in the area of scheduler performance connectivity coupled with diagnostics
    of understanding why a HPC SOA service is failing. On the diagnostics side of
    things, it‚Äôs just painful. We need a better User Experience (UX) from the developer
    toolset.
