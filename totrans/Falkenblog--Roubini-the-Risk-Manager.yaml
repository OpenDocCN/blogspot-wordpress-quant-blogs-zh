- en: Consider also recent bank risk-taking. The media has recently reported that
    Citigroup and Bank of America were buying up some of the AAA-tranches of nonprime
    mortgage-backed securities. Didn't the government provide insurance on portfolios
    of $300 billion and $118 billion on the very same stuff for Citi and BofA this
    past year? These securities are at the heart of the financial crisis and the core
    of the PPIP. If true, this is egregious behavior -- and it's incredible that there
    are no restrictions against it.

  zh: 同时也应该考虑最近银行的风险承担。媒体最近披露，花旗集团和美国银行正在购买一些非优质抵押贷款支持证券的AAA级。政府是否提供了对花旗和美国银行过去一年持有的价值3000亿和1180亿美元的投资组合的保险？这些证券是金融危机的核心，也是公共私人投资伙伴关系的核心。如果这属实，这就是很恶劣的行为——令人难以置信的是，竟没有对此这样的限制。
- en: Typical risk manager, looking in the rear view mirror. An AAA mortgage now is
    not like a AAA mortgage in 2007\. Mortgages have been tanking for 18 months. They
    experienced historic losses in that time. So, using the same logic that got us
    in this mess, assumes that these assets, regardless of current quality (mortgages
    are a heterogeneous lot), all mortgages are now ultra risky.

  zh: 典型的风险管理者，总是只顾后视镜。现在的AAA等级的抵押贷款和2007年的AAA等级的抵押贷款已不同。抵押贷款已经暴跌了18个月。这18个月中有史无前的损失。因此，如果用让我们陷入这个困境的同样逻辑，假设这些资产，不管当前的质量如何（抵押贷款是一个异质的群体），现在所有的抵押贷款都是极高风险的。
- en: As the rating agencies are especially wary about mortgages, any specific AAA
    rated mortgage security is probably the least risky AAA security out there. The
    incentives for doing this are all skewed in favor of being too pessimistic. Historically,
    the best ABS investments have been in areas with above average defaults in the
    recent cycle. I don't think commercial real estate mortgage backed securities
    (CMBS) had any losses from 1992 to 2000, as the rating agencies overcompensated.
    Thus, if the rating agencies are specifying some mortgage backed securities as
    AAA, I bet they are pretty safe.

  zh: 通常评级机构对于抵押贷款格外谨慎，任一特定的AAA级别抵押贷款证券很有可能是最不风险的AAA级别证券。这种做法的动机全部偏向于悲观过头。根据历史，最好的ABS投资都发生在最近周期中远高于平均水平的损失领域。我认为商业地产的抵押贷款支持证券（CMBS）在1992-2000年没有任何损失，因为评级机构进行了过多的补偿。所以，如果评级机构不划分一些抵押贷款支持证券至AAA级，我敢打赌它们很安全。
- en: But, using the reasoning that those assets that 'got us into this mess' are
    now ALL bad, he suggests micromanaging the banks to exclude such assets going
    forward. It's all too typical, and exactly the kind of stupid extrapolation that
    led investors to believe that ALL mortgages were safe simply because they had
    historically low losses. Details matter. For mortgages, the fact that so many
    were becoming no-documentation, teaser rate, high LTV loans, was significant,
    but those are details. For current mortgages, ignoring these details on mortgages
    is equally an error, even if in the other direction. Pushing banks into other
    'regulator approved' safe assets was also a cause of this crisis, and we shouldn't
    do that again. Regulators, or academics who never worked for a bank, are not forward
    looking.

  zh: 但是，通过这样的推理：把 “让我们陷入这个困境的” 资产现在都看作是不好的，他建议对银行进行微观管理，以排除向前的这类资产。这太典型了，而且正是这种愚蠢的外推，让投资者相信所有抵押贷款都是安全的，只因为它们曾经有过低得历史损失。细节很重要。对于抵押贷款来说，之前有这么多无文件、低利率、高贷款价值比的贷款是很重要的，但这些都是细节。对于目前的抵押贷款来说，忽视这些细节同样是一个错误，即便它是另一个方向上的错误。把银行推向其他‘监管机构认可’
    的安全资产也导致了这场危机，我们不应该再这样做了。监管机构或者从未为银行工作过的学者并不具备前瞻性。
