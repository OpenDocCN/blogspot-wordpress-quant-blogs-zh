    is about 4.2% and the S&P 500 is trading at 21.8 times reported earnings and 14.6
    times forward earnings. In recessions, analysts cannot forecast forward earnings
    well so we’ll throw out the forward P/E. Using reported earnings and plugging
    the results into the Fed model, which has [well documented problems](http://www.hussmanfunds.com/wmc/wmc070820.htm),
    the market is slightly undervalued.'

    of the investment banks. The investment banks tend to bottom out at a price to
    book ratio of 1 during periods of economic stress. The major investment banks
    such as Morgan Stanley (MS) and Merrill Lynch (MER) are now trading at 1.3-1.4
    times book, down from about 1.5-1.8 in [late April](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2008/04/still-waiting-for-market-bottom.html).
    Lehman Brothers (LEH), which has had well publicized troubles, now trades at a
    discount to book value, as are some other brokers such as E-Trade (ETFC). The
    trouble is, of course, we don’t quite know how good the book value figure really
    is as there may be further write-offs coming down the road.

    are likely in a period where the market moves sideways (see previous [comment](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2008/05/decade-long-low-return-environment-for.html)).
    Based on these considerations, I would rate the valuation metric as being neutral
    to mildly bullish.

    an eye on the problem areas of the economy in order to time the turn in the market.
    The troubled industries in this recession are financials and real estate. Employment
    is another area that inevitably falls off in economic slowdowns. The financials
    and investment banks may be near levels where they stabilize but these stocks
    and the other problem groups are still underperforming with no end in sight.'
