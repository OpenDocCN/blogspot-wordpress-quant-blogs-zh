- en: A few minutes ago the S&P 500 index made an intraday low of 1151.49\. While
    it remains to be seen whether this line in the sand will hold, it is important
    to note that the SPX is now 68.35 points below the high water mark of 1219.80
    from April 26^(th). This means the index has corrected 5.6%, which is exactly
    the average (mean) pullback over the course of the past 14 months

    in March 2009\. In percentage terms, the current pullback ranks 5^(th) out of
    12\. Note that the pullbacks ranked fifth through eighth are all clustered around
    the 5.6% average.

- en: Ultimately, the significance of a 5.6% pullback pales in comparison to fundamental
    issues surrounding [Greece](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Greece),
    [Portugal](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Portugal) and [Spain](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Spain)
    (where the investors should pay the most attention), but given that 1150 also
    happens to be the high that preceded the January-February 9.2% pullback, the largest
    pullback since the bull market began, support in the area of 1150 to 1151 should
    be taken very seriously.
