# Blog Beauty Pageant – Quantum Financier

> 来源：[https://quantumfinancier.wordpress.com/2010/05/12/theme/#0001-01-01](https://quantumfinancier.wordpress.com/2010/05/12/theme/#0001-01-01)

Just a quick post to tell you not to be surprised if I change the theme of my blog, or at the very least the font size, during the day, some reader have brought to my attention the difficulty to read posts. I will be experimenting with WordPress’ themes and HTML today to find a solution. It is made harder by the fact that I don’t really want to take a blog theme already used by the quant blogosphere big players (a real shame since they are pretty nice). Regardless, expect a post testing the time machine algorithm on different asset classes; commodities, currencies later today.
