- en: A staggering amount of effort has been spent -- and wasted -- exploring the
    idea of market efficiency. The notoriously malleable efficient markets hypothesis
    (EMH) claims (in its weakest form) that markets are "information efficient" --
    market movements are unpredictable because smart investors keep them that way.
    They should quickly -- even, "instantaneously" in some statements -- pounce on
    any predictable pattern in the market, and by profiting will act to wipe out that
    pattern.

- en: ', for example) about the masses of evidence against this idea. It''s not that
    predictable patterns don''t attract investors who often act in ways that tend
    to wipe out those patterns through arbitrage. Part of the problem is that investors
    often act in ways that amplify the pattern (following trends, for example). Moreover,
    there are fundamental limits to arbitrage -- "the markets can stay irrational
    longer than you can stay solvent." Still, the EMH stumbles onward like a zombie
    -- dead, proven incorrect and misleading, yet still taking center place in the
    way many people think of markets.'

- en: by Doyne Farmer and Spyros Skouras, which explore analogies between finance
    and ecology. This analogy is itself deeply suggestive. They note, for example,
    how the interactions between hedge funds can be useful viewed in ecological terms
    -- funds sometimes act as direct competitors (the profits of one reducing opportunities
    for another), and in other cases as predator and prey or as symbiotic partners.
    But I want to look specifically at an effort they make to give a rough estimate
    of the timescale over which the actions of sophisticated arbitragers might reasonably
    be expected to wipe out a new predictable pattern in the market. That is, if the
    market for whatever reason is temporarily inefficient -- showing a predictable
    pattern -- how quickly should it be returned to efficiency? How long is the time
    to relaxation that the EMH claims is "instantaneous" or close to it?

- en: The gist of their idea is very simple. Before you can exploit a predictable
    pattern, you first have to identify it. If you're going to invest money trading
    against it, you need to be fairly sure you've identified a real pattern, not just
    a statistical fluke. If you're going to invest somebody else's money, you have
    to convince them. This takes some time. The stronger the pattern, the more it
    stands out and the less time it should take to be sure. Weaker signals will be
    hidden by more noise, and reliable identification will take longer. Looking at
    how much time it should take to get good statistics should give an order of magnitude
    of how long a pattern should persist before any smart investor can begin reliably
    trading against it and (perhaps) erasing it.

    more deterministic and easier to exploit, then the time over which it might be
    expected to vanish is smaller. Truly obvious patterns can be expected to vanish
    quickly. But if S is small, the timescale for identification and exploitation
    grows.

- en: As Farmer and Skouras note, successful investment strategies often have Sharpe
    ratios of about S = 1, so this gives a result of about 10 years. [This is the
    result if one makes the analysis on an annual timescale, with the Sharpe ratio
    calculated on a yearly basis. If we're talking about fast algorithmic trading,
    then the analysis takes place on a shorter timescale.]

- en: 'So, 10 years is the order of magnitude estimate -- which is a rather peculiar
    interpretation of the word "instantaneous." Perhaps that word should be replaced
    in the EMH with "very slowly," although that somewhat dampens the appeal of the
    idea: "The EMH asserts that sophisticated investors will very slowly identify
    and exploit any inefficiencies in the market, tending the erase those inefficiencies
    over a few decades or so." Given that new inefficiencies can be expected the arise
    in the mean time, you might as well call this more plausible hypothesis the PIMH:
    the perpetually inefficient markets hypothesis.'

- en: We should stress that this estimate is based on idealized assumptions, such
    as log-normal returns – heavy tails, autocorrelations, and other effects will
    tend to make the timescale even longer.... As a given inefficiency is exploited,
    it will become weaker and the Sharpe ratio of investment strategies associated
    with it drops. As the Sharpe ratio becomes smaller the fluctuations in its returns
    become bigger, which can generate uncertainty about whether or not the strategy
    is still viable. This slows down the approach to inefficiency even more.

    in years and we''re thinking about predictable patterns emerging on the usual
    investment horizon of a year or longer, patterns exploited by hedge funds and
    mutual funds of the more traditional (not high frequency) kind.  Here we see that
    the time to expect predictable patterns to be wiped out is very long indeed. If
    10 years is the order of magnitude, then it''s likely some of these patterns persist
    for several decades -- getting up to the time of a typical investing career. Hardcore
    supporters of the EMH should learn to speak more honestly: "We have every reason
    to expect that predictable market inefficiencies should be wiped out fairly quickly,
    at least on the timescale of a human investment career."'

- en: All in all, this way of estimating the time for relaxation back to the "efficient
    equilibrium" suggests that the relaxation is anything but fast, and often very
    slow. The EMH may be right that there likely aren't any obvious patterns, but
    more subtle predictable patterns will likely persist for long periods of time,
    even while they present real profit opportunities. The market is not in equilibrium.
    And with no mechanism to prevent them, new predictable patterns and "inefficiencies"
    should be emerging all the time.
