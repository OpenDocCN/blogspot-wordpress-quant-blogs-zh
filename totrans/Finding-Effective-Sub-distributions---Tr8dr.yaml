    post.   I have a number of related problems I am interested in solving.    Setting
    up the problem, let us say that we have a distribution **p (E | C)**, where both
    **E** and **C** are sets of the same dimension (d):'

    where many of the variables in the dimension are independent, the joint probability
    of  a specific 1000 variable state, will often be much less than the probability
    of a lower dimensional state variable (of say 20 variables with covariance).'

    most predictive.   Another way to state this is what subsets of **C** provide
    the most information transfer into  **E**.

    that carry the most information from **C** → **E**.

- en: '**Problem 2: Sub-distributions with C and E of different dimension** As in
    problem 1, we look for subsets of **C** that carry the most predictive information
    for subsets of **E**.   In this case, though, C and E need not be of the same
    dimension.  Combinatorially this is a harder problem than problem #1, however
    the math is the same.'
