- en: Notwithstanding his misunderstanding that tariffs are not paid by the Chinese,
    but American importers, this tweet sounds like an effort to put pressure on China,
    just as Vice Premier Liu He is scheduled to arrive in Washington on Wednesday
    with a large (100+) trade delegation for detailed discussions. News reports indicate
    that both sides have given significant ground, and a deal may have been possible
    by Friday.

    Donald Trump upended negotiations by threatening new tariffs on Sunday, according

- en: One of the sources briefed on the status of talks said the Chinese would send
    a smaller delegation than the 100-person group originally planned. It is unclear
    whether Vice Premier Liu He would still helm this smaller group, an important
    detail if the team were traveling to Washington with an eye toward sealing a deal.
    Two senior administration officials described Liu as "the closer", since he had
    been given authority to negotiate on President Xi Jinping's behalf.

    tweets, which could be interpreted as a signal that Beijing did not want to unnecessarily
    escalate the conflict. The front pages of the two major Chinese news portals had
    no mention of Trump's threats.

    the new levels would be higher than most EM economies, and have a devastating
    effect on global trade.
