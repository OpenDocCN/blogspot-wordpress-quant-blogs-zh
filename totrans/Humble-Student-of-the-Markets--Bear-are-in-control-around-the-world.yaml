    The picture isn't pretty. It shows a market environment of the bears in control

- en: Starting in the US, a look at the SPX shows that the average is testing its
    200 day moving average. Note how the 50 and 200 day moving averages are converging
    with the 50 day MA falling and the 200 day MA rising. Unless the market stages
    a significant rally here, we are likely to see a Dark Cross (indicating that a
    downtrend has begun) within a month from now.

- en: Regular readers know that I watch commodity prices closely as the canaries in
    the coal mine of global growth and asset inflationary expectations and commodity
    prices offer a slim ray of hope. A look at the CRB Index shows that commodity
    prices are testing its 200-day moving average, but the 50 and 200 day moving averages
    are also exhibitng the same pattern of convergence. We are likely to see a Dark
    Cross indicating a downtrend within a month.

    than the commodity complex. Here in Canada, the S&P/TSX Composite has already
    broken down below its 200 day moving average and it's showing the same pattern
    of converging moving averages leading to a pending Dark Cross.

    showing that the market internals appear to be turning around a little bit. My
    favorite measure of risk appetite, namely the relative returns of Consumer Discretionary
    to Consumer Staples, is turning up. As the chart below shows, that ratio is rallying
    up to test a relative downtrend line.
