- en: I just wanted to briefly share some initial impressions of the 2nd edition of
    Stephen Marsland's very hands on text, "Machine Learning, *An Algorithmic Perspective.*" 
    Having been a big fan of the first, I requested a review copy from Dr. Marsland,
    and with his help, the publishers were kind enough to send me a review copy. I
    spent the the last few months going over most of the newer topics and testing
    many of the newer scripts in Python. With that, I'll dive into some of my impressions
    of the text.

- en: 'I''ve stated before, that I thought the 1st edition was hands down, one of
    the best texts covering applied Machine Learning from a Python perspective. I
    still consider this to be the case. The text, already extremely broad in scope,
    has been expanded to cover some very relevant modern topics, including:'

    There are several things that separate this text's approach from many of the other
    texts covering Machine Learning.  One, is that the text covers a very wide range
    of useful topics and algorithms. You rarely find a Machine Learning text with
    coverage in areas like evolutionary learning (genetic programming) or sampling
    methods (SIR, Metropolis-Hasting, etc).  This is one reason I recommend the text
    highly to students of MOOC courses like Andrew Ng's excellent 'Machine Learning',
    or Hastie and Tibshirani's, 'An Introduction to Statistical learning'. Many of
    these students are looking to expand their set of skills in Machine Learning,
    with a desire to access working concrete code that they can build and run.

- en: While the book does not overly focus on mathematical proofs and derivations,
    there is sufficient mathematical coverage that enables the student to follow along
    and understand the topics. Some knowledge of Linear Algebra and notation is always
    useful in any Machine Learning course. Also, the text is written in such a way,
    that if you simply want to cover a topic, such as particle filtering, you don't
    necessarily need to read all of the prior chapters to follow. This is useful for
    those readers looking to refresh their knowledge of more modern topics.

- en: I did, occasionally, have to translate some of the Python code to work with
    Python 3.4\. However, the editing was very minimal. For example, print statements
    in earlier versions did not require parentheses around the print arguments. So
    you can just change print 'this' to print('this'), for example.

- en: I found the coverage of particle filters and sampling, highly relevant to financial
    time series-- as we have seen, such distributions often require models that depart
    from normality assumptions. I might possibly add a tutorial on this, sometime
    in the future.

- en: In summary, I highly recommend this text to anyone that wants to learn Machine
    Learning, and finds the best way to augment learning is having access to working,
    concrete, code examples.  In addition, I particularly recommend it to those students
    that have followed along from more of a Statistical Learning perspective (Ng,
    Hastie, Tibshirani) and are looking to broaden their knowledge of applications. 
    The updated text is very timely, covering topics that are very popular right now
    and have little coverage in existing texts in this area.
