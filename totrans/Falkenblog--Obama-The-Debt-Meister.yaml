    on some unknown good fortune to bail him out. In an excellent bit of sleuthing,

    Michelle had a 4-times a week visit from a personal trainer, shoes, piano lessons
    and private school for the kids, other expenses consistent with the lifestyle
    to which they had become accustomed (they were both Harvard Law grads, after all).
    The Obamas' adjusted gross income averaged $257,000 from 2000 to 2004\. Yet tax
    returns for 2004 reveal $14,395 in mortgage deductions. This implies they owed
    about $240,000 on a home they purchased for $159,250 in 1999, which means they
    spent about $80,000 beyond their income from 1999 to 2004\. Then Obama's book
    sales soared and Michelle explained, "It was like Jack and his magic beans."

    to curb their excesses. But when he speaks of prudence or living within a budget,
    he is not speaking from experience.
