    are on deck.

- en: The first of these is that [according to Technorati](http://technorati.com/blogs/vixandmore.blogspot.com?reactions),
    98 blogs have linked to VIX and More in the seven months it has been up and running.
    Technorati's [Authority number](http://support.technorati.com/faq/topic/71?replies=1)
    only looks back at a rolling six month period, so it may take a little longer
    for their official number to register triple digits, but I'll be counting down
    in the background with my own pro forma numbers.

    many ways to count this and [Sitemeter](http://www.sitemeter.com/?a=stats&s=s31bobottb),
    whose widget I have on the blog, tends to be one of the more conservative visitor
    counters. Depending upon who is doing the counting, VIX and More has either recently
    surpassed 50,000 unique visitors or is just about to do so.

    the work I have put in and yesterday I received notice that VIX and More was ranked
    as one of the '[Top 100 Day Trading Blogs](http://www.currencytrading.net/2007/top-100-day-trading-blogs/)'
    at [CurrencyTrading.net](http://www.currencytrading.net/). While I do not consider
    myself to be a day trader, any list on which I appear sandwiched between [Adam
    Warner](http://adamsoptions.blogspot.com/) and [Pete Stolcers](http://www.oneoption.com/)
    is going to put a smile on my face.
