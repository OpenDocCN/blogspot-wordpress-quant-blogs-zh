- en: My understanding is that a hidden order submitted after these LOC orders could
    gain priority without providing a better price. If the NBBO were 10.09/10.13,
    and someone submitted a hidden bid at $10.11 100ms before the auction, I believe
    IEX’s auction logic would still price the auction at $10.10 [[3](#bottom3iexauctions)]
    — but the hidden order would be executed in place of the LOC bid. This may feel
    “unfair” because the hidden order was submitted long after the LOC order and had
    virtually zero risk of moving the matching price (because the hidden bid is priced
    at the $10.09 “for the purpose of determining the clearing price”). And unlike
    LOC (or MOC) orders, the hidden order does not have a “no-cancel” period, so could
    be canceled even 1ms before the auction.
  id: totrans-16
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 我的理解是，在这些 LOC 订单之后提交的隐藏订单可能会优先执行而无需提供更好的价格。 如果 NBBO 是 10.09/10.13，而有人在拍卖前 100
    毫秒提交了 $10.11 的隐藏竞价，我相信 IEX 的拍卖逻辑仍然会将拍卖定价为 $10.10 —— 但隐藏订单将被执行以取代 LOC 订单。 这可能感觉“不公平”，因为隐藏订单是在
    LOC 订单之后提交的，并且几乎没有移动匹配价格的风险（因为隐藏竞价定价为 $10.09“用于确定结算价格”）。 与 LOC（或 MOC）订单不同，隐藏订单没有“无法取消”的期限，因此甚至可以在拍卖前
    1 毫秒取消。

- en: Under certain conditions, this functionality gives traders the opportunity to
    simultaneously gain priority while offering a less competitive price, a rare confluence
    in normal markets. One reason why traders submit LOC/MOC orders (and displayed
    orders) is because they want to announce their intentions to attract liquidity.
    IEX’s hidden order logic shouldn’t change that. But other auction traders only
    announce their intentions because they want priority. This latter group may find
    the advantages of hidden orders hard to resist.

  zh: 在某些条件下，这种功能使交易员有机会同时获得优先权并提供一个竞争力较弱的价格，在正常市场中这种罕见的汇合。交易员提交LOC/MOC订单（和显示订单）的一个原因是因为他们想要宣布他们的意图来吸引流动性。IEX的隐藏订单逻辑不应该改变这一点。但其他拍卖交易员只是宣布他们的意图是因为他们想要优先权。后者可能会发现隐藏订单的优势难以抗拒。

    it’s worth submitting a displayed order on top of suspected hidden orders. (In

- en: I’m also not sure this functionality was an oversight. IEX [says](https://medium.com/boxes-and-lines/the-iex-auction-pursuing-better-price-discovery-a65cb9aeeadb)
    it exists “to protect the anonymity of resting non-displayed interest.” And “IEX
    Auctions were strategically designed after extensive research and informal discussion
    with various market participants.” But IEX did not find it appropriate to employ
    this functionality for auctions occuring after volatility pauses or halts, perhaps
    because those auctions can be chaotic and have a particular need for transparency.
    The thing is, some days the open and close can also be volatile, and those are
    the days when it’s most important for exchanges to run a smooth auction. [[6](#bottom6iexauctions)]
