    (what about courage, discipline, gratitude, or prudence?). Yet Wooden was a highly
    successful man, living for 99 healthy years, producing many championship teams,
    positively impacting many young men. It reminds me of the editor of the Great
    Books series,

    than unguided observations. I think the key is to be intelligent, start from a
    decent set of assumptions, and work every day towards becoming a better man. If
    you use reality as a filter, you will do OK.

    signals as opposed to principles. I remember one NYT story about how these junk
    bond investors were all acolytes of the great Ed Altman, yet I have never met
    a junk bond investor who thinks highly of such models, and Altman's model is pretty
    lame, about as powerful as rank-ordering firms by Net Income/Assets. They wanted
    to project gravitas, so they paid lip service to the old man. Similarly, people
    highlight their idea is derivative from some esteemed source, but that's merely
    posturing.
