- en: Having made some progress with H2O Flow, its time to leverage [R](http://www.h2o.ai/product/integration/)
    using RStudio. ¬†As I mentioned in a previous posting, the overarching of data
    science is ensuring you have the right data, and use the right algorithms, else
    you‚Äôll get rubbish insight üôÇ

    AI before doing anything with data. ¬†If the data your refining is the definitive
    data set, then your hands are tied üò¶ ¬†If you happen to own the platform your getting
    the data from, then you can at least enhance data collection to aid the AI side
    of the equation.

    becomes clear very quickly that you either don‚Äôt currently have the data, or the
    data isn‚Äôt shaped appropriately to be ingested by the AI model. ¬†Sometimes creating
    a sample test data set at least allow thought to be put into the model and the
    outputs ‚Äì classifications, predictions etc, prior to taking real world data, and
    continuing to refine the model.

    and very useful just to get going. ¬†Further, its lighter than running H2O web
