    necessary and sufficient condition for a financial crisis. As to what caused the
    initial problem, Gorton highlights housing price declines, noting that the subprime
    Asset Backed securities assumed prices could only rise or stay flat. As a rule,
    any collateral should be assumed to have the same expected return, say a couple
    percent above the risk free rate. Further, its future volatility should assume
    that the historical moves up reveal potential moves downward (e.g., the 50% upturn
    suggests a 50% downturn is highly probable). The junk bonds at the center of the
    1990 financial crisis, the high tech financing in the 2001 crisis, the lending
    to oil states in the 1980s, were all associated with excessive leverage based
    on the idea that collateral would either be stable or rise. It''s a common mistake,
    made in different asset classes each time. As my old mentor Kevin Blakely has
    said, the problem of excessive leverage keeps showing up with different names:
    Highly Levered Transactions (HLTs), equity financing (loans backed by firm ''equity''),
    Alt-A mortgage-backed securities.'

  zh: 这本书不是对危机的决定性陈述，但它强调了金融危机的一个必要和充分条件。至于什么导致了最初的问题，戈顿强调了房价下跌，指出次级抵押证券假设价格只能上涨或保持不变。一般来说，任何抵押品都应该被假定具有相同的预期收益，比如超过无风险利率的几个百分点。此外，它的未来波动性应该假设历史上的上升会显示潜在的向下移动(例如，50%的上涨表明50%的下降是非常可能的)。1990年金融危机的中心是垃圾债券，2001年危机是高科技融资，1980年代是对石油国家的贷款，都与过度杠杆有关，这是基于抵押品要么稳定要么上涨的想法。这是一个常见的错误，在每次不同的资产类别中都犯了。正如我的老导师凯文·布雷利所说，过度杠杆的问题一次次以不同的名字出现：高度杠杆交易(HLTs)，股权融资(以公司'股权'作担保的贷款)，Alt-A抵押贷款支持证券。
