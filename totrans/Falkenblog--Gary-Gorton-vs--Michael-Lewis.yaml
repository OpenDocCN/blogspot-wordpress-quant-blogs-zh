    securities have a 0.01% default rate, so from a bayesian perspective, when you
    see a default here the probability is not that one was very unfortunate, but rather,
    the rating was wrong. Perhaps all ratings are wrong?! Everyone was scrambling
    to understand how much these previously innocuous securities were worth and found
    them insanely complicated, so people naturally assumed the root cause could be
    anything related to the housing-related securities: debt, derivatives, rated securities,

    this way, as overreactions caused by people not being able to suss out the essence
    of a crisis in real time. Gorton notes crises occurred regularly in the US (1819,
    1837, 1860, 73, 84, 90, 93, 1907, 1914, 1931-33), and every time, people are befuddled.

    they fail in totally unappreciated new ways. For example, the Fed contracted the

    one that the government insure 'approved AAA' paper, to help reduce the risk of
    a panic, but given their role in the reduction of credit underwriting standards
    (documented on page 66), it is then likely they would have made the essential
    mistake worse, because one thing government does not do well is admit mistakes,
    because they don't have to (unfortunately, no government agency has gone bankrupt).

    and that if you had to mark their books to market, (indeed we had new accounting,
    FAS 157 that tried to apply market prices to accounting during the crisis), this
    would basically cause massive dislocations. Why not increase bank capital rates
    from 4-8%, to 20+%? I don't see a consistent risk premium in financial markets,
    so the cost is rather low. That is, the market

    necessary and sufficient condition for a financial crisis. As to what caused the
    initial problem, Gorton highlights housing price declines, noting that the subprime
    Asset Backed securities assumed prices could only rise or stay flat. As a rule,
    any collateral should be assumed to have the same expected return, say a couple
    percent above the risk free rate. Further, its future volatility should assume
    that the historical moves up reveal potential moves downward (e.g., the 50% upturn
    suggests a 50% downturn is highly probable). The junk bonds at the center of the
    1990 financial crisis, the high tech financing in the 2001 crisis, the lending
    to oil states in the 1980s, were all associated with excessive leverage based
    on the idea that collateral would either be stable or rise. It''s a common mistake,
    made in different asset classes each time. As my old mentor Kevin Blakely has
    said, the problem of excessive leverage keeps showing up with different names:
    Highly Levered Transactions (HLTs), equity financing (loans backed by firm ''equity''),
    Alt-A mortgage-backed securities.'
