    the level that is defined as 50% above its calendar year low (13.30 in August).
    This would suggest that volatility buyers view portfolio insurance as too expensive
    at current levels. In turn, this could have a calming effect on the broader market,
    as the mechanics of portfolio insurance purchases are a coincidental capping mechanism.

    for both stocks and the economy as a whole - corporations facing a deceleration
    in earnings growth or an outright drop in year-over-year profits **DO NOT INCREASE
    SPENDING AND HIRING**. They just don't. That is why earnings recessions make for
    a pretty good economic indicator, we can argue about whether it is a leading or
    a coincident indicator some other time.
