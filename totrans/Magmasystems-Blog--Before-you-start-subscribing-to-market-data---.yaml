- en: Several Wall Street companies have gotten big fines when the exchanges have
    found out that people or "interrogation devices" that were not entitled to use
    market data were actually using it. Try looking at this document and see if you
    can figure out what you need to license if you have a single PC with several different
    WinForms apps, each app capable of letting one user see the NASDAQ data feed.
    And, what happens if there are multiple users on that PC?

    various applets running inside of one desktop shell.
