- en: Given the headlines I thought that it would be a useful exercise to analyze
    Miller’s macro bets and see what he did to achieve his returns this year. The
    chart below shows the fund’s exposure to the Financial sector. Miller had known
    to be a big believer in Financials and had been overweight the sector going into
    the Lehman crisis and out. The bet in the sector was responsible for the freefall
    in returns but the recovery of the sector also contributed to his turnaround in
    2009.

- en: Miller’s critics might accuse him of being a stopped clock, but the next chart,
    which shows his fund’s exposure to the cyclical sector, indicates that he was
    prescient in his timing. LMVTX began to increase its cyclical exposure in mid-2008,
    pulled back and then went all-in with its pro-cyclical bet in early 2009\. That
    bet has paid off handsomely in 2009\. The timing of the cyclical bet was remarkable
    given the low level of turnover the fund has historically exhibited.
