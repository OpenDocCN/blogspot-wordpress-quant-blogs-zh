- en: The DVI is an intermediate oscillator which is a subset of the DVIO (like DVO,
    it is a flexible and adaptive indicator). There are several complementary components
    to the DVI, that aid in identifying intermediate overbought and oversold opportunities.
    Keep in mind that intermediate or long term oscillators have a hard time differentiating
    between long-term trends and true exhaustion points. As a consquence research
    shows that several factors seem to be present at exhaustion points (see the preview
    for the DVI), and stretch is one them.

    an oscillator that represents the number of days that the stock or ETF is stretched
    (not consecutively). Like the DVO, the DVS indicator is scaled using the PERCENTRANK
    function with a default lookback of 1-year. The equation is as follows:'

    mean (50th percentile). The suggested overbought/oversold bands would occur at
    80 and 20.

- en: Results are even better when you use the DV2 instead of up/down days. As you
    can see the DVS is a consistent moderator of short-term returns, and if it is
    not aligned in the same direction (ie buying after down days when the market is
    overbought) it can subsume the shorter term mean reversion signal performance.
    In a future post we will look at how the DVS affects short signals, and also how
    it performs with in conjunction with the DV2.
