    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading
    "buy" signal. The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of
    the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. Past trading of
    the trading model has shown turnover rates of about 200% per month.

    analysts have attributed the rally to a Trump effect, the chart below shows the
    SPX and international stocks, as measured by MSCI EAFE, during that period. Both
    asset classes have performed roughly in line with each other. This indicates the
    lack of a pronounced Trump effect as the outlook for non-US stocks should not
    be affected by the prospect of Trump tax cuts and deregulation. The main reason
    for equity strength was a broad based global growth recovery.

    on government. For now, many parts of the US federal government is running on
    autopilot. However, with no ambassadors in place in South Korea, China, or Japan,
    and an unfilled post of the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia, the recent
    crisis, or near-crisis, over North Korea highlights the vulnerabilities of a slimmed
    down government.

    have to focus on the fundamentals. For now, the fundamentals remain positive.
