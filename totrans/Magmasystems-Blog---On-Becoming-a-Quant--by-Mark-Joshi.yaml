    who have harbored the fantasy of becomign a quant, here is a treatise on what
    it is like in the real world. Thanks to Mark Joshi for writing this.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Main plusses close to the money and opportunities to move into trading.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Minuses can be stressful and depending on the outfit may not involve
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Research quant tries to invent new pricing approaches and sometimes
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All forms of quants spend a large amount (i.e. more than half) their
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: search under ”quant”, the FT appointments section on a Thursday,
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and www.wilmott.com has a jobs board. A lot of adverts are from
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: recruitment consultants rather than from banks. It’s important to
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: realize that the job may not even exist – the consultant wants to get
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: decent candidates that he can then try to place them in banks. The
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: consultant gets a commission from the bank if he can place you. They
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: tend to have short attention spans. If you do well at the first couple of
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: interviews then they will work hard to get you a good job but if you
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: don’t they will quickly lose interest. Also, be aware their agenda is to
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: get a good commission rather than to help you so they will push you
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: at jobs on that basis.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In fact, going via a recruitment consultant is the standard way to
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: get a job. Quants are generally not hired as a part of the on campus
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: recruitment process but instead hired as they are needed by the team.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because of this it’s not a great idea to start applying a long time before
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you want to start. Obviously personal contacts should be exploited
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: as much as possible. Banks tend not to be into paying expenses for
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: interviews. One therefore needs to go to London or New York and
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: attempt to get as many interviews as possible as quickly as possible.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What should one learn? Standard books are
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: • Hull - Options future and other derivatives – comprehensive
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but low level mathematically and can be frustrating for pure
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: mathematicians
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: • Baxter and Rennie – accessible introduction to martingale approach
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but oriented towards theory rather than practicalitues
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: • Wilmott (Derivatives) – good on the PDE approach but not so
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: good on other approaches.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: My book will be published in early 2003 and I like it, of course.
  prefs: []

- en: Stochastic calculus is useful but not as important as it at first appears.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Standard texts are Oksendal, and Karatzas and Shreve. It’s
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: hard to find the time to pick it up on the job so it’s worth learning in
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: advance. It’s also worth spending some time going over basic probability
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: theory – eg Chung’s books.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Interviewers tend to care more about understanding the basics well
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: than on knowing a lot. It’s also important to demonstrate genuine
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: interest in the field. Read the Economist and the FT or Wall Street
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Journal comprehensively. It’s not unusual to ask basic calculus or analysis
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: questions e.g. what is the integral of log x. Asking for a derivation

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: job. I would advise against starting before it’s awarded as it tends to
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: one’s hands dirty and learning to be more focussed on getting numeric
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: results than on fancy theories. The main way to do this is to implement
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: pricing models for practice. If this doesn’t appeal you aren’t suited to
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: being a quant. There are quite a few ex-pure mathematicians working
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in the city so it can certainly be done but there is some prejudice
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How much does a quant earn? A quant with no experience will
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: generally get between 35 and 50k pounds. This will generally go up
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: fairly rapidly. Bonuses are generally a large component of total salary.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some of the American banks expect much longer hours. Wall St tends
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
