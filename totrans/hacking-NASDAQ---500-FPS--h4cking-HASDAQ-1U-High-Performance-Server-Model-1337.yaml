    was teaming up with a small HFT group that would have been really cool but.. alas
    fell thru at the last minute, thus had to re-group both infra and strategies.
    So as of now im finally plugged in hooked up and almost ready to let that first
    strategy run loose to generate those millions of dollars ... ho ho ho ha :P

    expensive enterprise grade name brand servers are. Typically HP G6 or G7, various
    flavors of IBM and occasionally a DELL shows up. Unfortunately these kinds of
    machines are out of my budget or more precisely I`d rather spend the money elsewhere
    so.... lets build are own 1U server on the cheap.

    kind of chassis is used for low end systems as the aiflow is pretty messed up
    ... but it fits my style, lean, mean and a hell of alot cheaper! Only major concern
    is airfow as cold air intake from the side and the blower pushing the air  out
    the back (pic is a little old) yet so far no problems.'

- en: That`s a saving of $12,000 not bad. Of course the reliability of the server, comparability,
    SLA is non existent, HDD are slow.. uses some "Desktop Grade" parts as well as
    a power supply of unknown origin. Not exactly the fairest of fair compairson to
    your decked out HP G7 box but spending money where it counts, CPU frez, Memory,
    and NIC. To sum it up nicely would be to say, if it fuck ups its your own fault
    and theres no support line to call/sob/pass the buck to.
