- en: I’m glad to see that yesterday’s [Arms Index Extremely Extended](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/12/arms-index-extremely-extended.html)
    post received so much attention.

- en: One of the concerns raised by a reader was that my chart of the Arms Index ([TRIN](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TRIN))
    only looked back to four years of history, so that the historical context prior
    to the current bear market consists entirely of bull market readings. For this
    reason, today’s chart goes all the way back to the beginning of TRIN data available
    at StockCharts.com.

- en: In the chart below, the 17 years of TRIN data results in such compressed and
    difficult to read 10 day EMA cycles that I have lengthened the exponential moving
    average period from yesterday’s 10 days to a 30 day EMA. Fortunately, because
    it is an EMA instead of an SMA, the peaks in the TRIN cycles are almost identical
    whether the EMA period is 10, 30 or 50 days.

- en: I have also removed the red and green horizontal lines from this long-term chart
    to reflect the fact that the TRIN had a lower mean prior to 2000, trended higher
    during the bear market from 2000-2003, and seems to have found a new mean value
    from 2004 through 2008\. For this reason, considered over the course of multi-year
    time frames, the TRIN is best thought of in relative terms rather than absolute
    terms.

- en: As I noted with yesterday’s chart, spikes in the TRIN have “historically provided
    excellent buying opportunities.” Low TRIN readings may also have some value from
    a market timing perspective, but these signals are generally not as robust as
    high TRIN readings. Finally, the TRIN is far from perfect in predicting market
    inflection points, but it does have a track record that is accurate enough to
    bear watching. As I noted yesterday, the TRIN is best suited for short to intermediate-term
    setups.
