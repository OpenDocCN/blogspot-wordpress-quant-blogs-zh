    solving. In short, insights tend to involve connections between small numbers
    of neurons....Just as it is hard to hear a quiet cell phone at a loud party, it
    is difficult to notice signals that have less energy than the general energy level
    already present in the brain. Hence, we tend to notice insights when our overall
    activity level in the brain is low. This happens when we’re not putting in a lot
    of mental effort, when we’re focusing on something repetitive
