    much fundamental analysis in years, but that doesn't mean that I don't have any
    skills in that area. In the aftermath of the news about Steve Jobs' unfortunate
    demise, there has been a lot of chatter about the fate of Apple in the post-Jobs
    era.

    Buffett has effectively used the concept of "economic moat" as a way of analyzing
    companies. Here is

    advantage that is difficult to copy or emulate, which provides a significant barrier
    to competition from other firms***. Buffett has often referred to an economic
    moat as being similar to a fortress or a medieval castle that one can not penetrate.

- en: My personal belief is that Apple is more than Steve Jobs. The company has many
    other talented people working for it. I believe that Apple's economic moat was
    not just the coolness of its products (which Jobs contributed to), but the iTunes
    platform.

- en: Apple has always embraced a closed architecture for its product lines. The way
    it made money, and lots of it, was to get people to come inside its walled garden
    and play. That walled garden is called iTunes. It is Apple's platform to sell
    its customers music and software content. Wall Street may be focused on how much
    of a hit the latest iPhone is, but all these gadgets are designed to drive the
    user to iTunes - which is the key to Apple's long-term cashflow.

- en: Speaking as an iPhone user, I opted for the iPhone over the Blackberry or Android
    platform was because of the combination of the utility of the device over the
    Blackberry and the advantages of Apple's closed architecture compared to the Android
    open architecture. (I am by no means an early adopter of technology - I tend to
    go with the crowd. As an example, my computers run Windows because of legacy software
    issues.)

    of malware written for mobile devices. If an Android device got infected, it is
    unclear who will be responsible for fixing it because responsibility is diffuse.
    By contrast, if software from an authorized iTunes dealer infected millions of
    iPhones and iPads, then I think that you can expect that Apple will move heaven
    and earth to remedy the problem -
