- en: The first building in the world designed as stock exchange and trade exchange
    was in Antwerp (Belgium). It was built in 1531, near the Meir (a shopping borough
    in the center of Antwerp).

- en: Even if it was definitely closed 15 years ago, the building is still there but
    all the legal entrances are sealed. That is a shame because it is (sorry, *was*)
    probably one of the most beautiful buildings of Antwerp. One photographer (*urban
    explorer*) told me one day that he was obliged to go through the sewers in order
    to get into the old building.
