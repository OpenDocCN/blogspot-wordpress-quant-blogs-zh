    Among the most interesting part of his speech was his alluding to having in the
    drawer some theories on new distributions and implications for option trading.
    But he didn't go further on the record but said that he would probably write a
    bit about in on Wilmott. His gave a very good speech, so I for one will definitely
    be on the lookout for his findings.

    prices have discontinuous fat tails that are hard to estimate, Black-Scholes fails.
    So, we should adjust Black-Scholes. But that's what the volatility smile, or smirk
    (depending on the market) does. Further, the bid-ask is sufficiently large that
    a price taker can't make money anticipating these 'unexpected' crashes. I know
    a couple of option market makers in little Minneapolis, and they all drive nice
    cars. Retail option traders, meanwhile, are forever operating on the hope that
    1) no one knows the real risk that stock X will implode or 2) by putting on a
    complex of options, you can lock in some above average return. Thus, the nice
    cars.

    I find this a bit like changing the name of the pterodactyl to a pterodon. Is
    it necessary? While Haug pooh-pooh's Black, Scholes, and Merton, for

    a pretty important finding. Risk is supposed to be darn important, and so, taking
    risk out of the equation turned a really hairy problem into a much simpler one.
    There are lots of option formulas that add terms to account for skewness, jumps
    and fat tails, but practice shows that people prefer merely applying the 'inconsistent'
    volatility surface rather than adding these parameters. Over time, a good option
    trader can them memorize the vol/strike/maturity gridspace, then monitor the changes
    level and sometimes shape of the vol surface. Any discovery stands on the shoulders
    of others, but it's really academic hair splitting to start a crusade to change
    the name of a formula based on some earlier, more obscure work by Thorpe or Bachelier
    that had parameters unexplained (that's why they have fewer cites). Rules of thumb
    in financial markets can make you rich, but they don't give you Nobel Prizes or
    naming rights. In any case, what would renaming Black-Scholes at this point do,
    other than confuse everyone?

- en: They argue that actual option prices on the open market may be simply the result
    of the interaction of supply and demand, with no formula involved. The second
    implication of Taleb and Haug is that implied volatility, a ubiquitous element
    of the markets, ceases to make sense. In fact, it would cease to exist... Rather
    than being the “market´s expected future turbulence” or the “market´s fear gauge”,
    as conventional wisdom would hold, implied volatility would have proven itself
    to be nothing but make-believe. A nonexistent ghost.

    wrong model to get the right price', and they think this implied is primarily
    due to supply and demand as opposed to actual volatility forecasts, then they
    should be able to make money pretty easily. Good luck with that. Given the bid-ask
    in option markets, you probably need only a 5-7 vol 'mismatch' to create an arbitrage
    via (gasp!) delta hedging an option. I think its really bad advice to tell people
    that implieds are almost arbitrary, hardly correlated with actual volatilities.

    they have one, or a couple, of 'big ideas'. Usually these ideas are just as silly
    as the big ideas that come from people who know very little math.
