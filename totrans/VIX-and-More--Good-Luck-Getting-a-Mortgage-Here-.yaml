    and investing background, but suffice it to say that I have been an active investor
    for 25 years, have traded all sorts of options for 10 years, have accounts with

    I opened and funded at the beginning of the month. Finally, I get a call from
    them today. I returned the call and their rep proudly informed me that I have
    been approved for Level 3 options trading – which is their equivalent of an investor
    with training wheels: no authority to write uncovered puts and calls for equities,

    doubt those three brokers will continue to get 95+% of my options business. Fortunately,
    I won't have to worry about how good the options executions are at Bank of America.
    What a joke...
