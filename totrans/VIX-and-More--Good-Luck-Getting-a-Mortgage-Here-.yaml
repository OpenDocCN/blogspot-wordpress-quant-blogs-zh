- en: So...just for the heck of it, I decided to open an account with Bank of America
    and see how well their 30 free trades a month promotion works and whether it makes
    sense to move a large chunk of money there and make them a part of the network
    of institutions with which I place most of my trades.

- en: 'On their options application BofA asks the usual questions about the number
    of years trading options, number of trades per year, average trade size, types
    of trades, etc. Given the substantial history and volume I have in this area,
    including writing naked options on equities and indices, I was surprised that
    it had taken several weeks for them to add options authority to an account that
    I opened and funded at the beginning of the month. Finally, I get a call from
    them today. I returned the call and their rep proudly informed me that I have
    been approved for Level 3 options trading – which is their equivalent of an investor
    with training wheels: no authority to write uncovered puts and calls for equities,
    not to mention index options. I just laughed. I love'

  zh: 在他们的期权申请表上，BofA问了关于期权交易年限、每年交易次数、平均交易规模、交易类型等通常问题。考虑到我在这一领域有大量的经验和交易量，包括对股票和指数进行裸期权交易，我很惊讶他们在我月初开设并注资的账户中添加期权权限竟然花了几个星期。今天，我终于接到他们的电话。我回电后，他们的代表自豪地告诉我，我已经获得了Level
    3期权交易权限——这相当于一个有训练轮子的投资者：没有权限为股票和指数期权编写未覆盖的看跌和看涨期权。我只是笑了笑。我喜欢

    doubt those three brokers will continue to get 95+% of my options business. Fortunately,
    I won't have to worry about how good the options executions are at Bank of America.
