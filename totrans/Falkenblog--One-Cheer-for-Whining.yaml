    loathes. Every constraint on the child, be it a parental command, a perceived
    privilege granted to a sibling, or frustration with not getting things to work
    as they want, can generate tears and screaming. As a parent, 'no whining' is a
    constant refrain. I was in the local Staples, and saw they had a book,

    the biggest learners. Its only because they get so excited and upset that they
    are sufficiently motivated to figure stuff out. A baby that doesn't cry, or an
    8-year old that smiles when he strikes out or gets fewer cookies than his brother,
    is insufficiently whiny. We are motivated to relieve frustration, and whining
    is a symptom of this angst, but these episodes are often very insightful. A life
    with merely the

    ignorant and ineffective. We all have to learn how to deal with constraints so
    that we both move on, but also address problems most efficiently, and you can''t
    avoid frustration and a little inevitable whining. Like anything, it''s a balance.'

    celebrates pathetic people who have been wronged, clearly too far in the whiny
    direction--solve your own damn problems! But in the right situation, in the right
    amounts, it is wise, and very few people figure this out--it takes a great deal
    of discipline and intelligence.

    went quietly to their executions. But at one point a woman who went up there screamed
    for her life, acting very 'beneath her station'. Seeing this, the crowd suddenly
    lost its appetite for executions, because they were no longer some abstract extermination,
    but real people who were being killed. It is among the bravest of things to face
    death with equanimity, but in this case some hysterics saved lives.

    and try to channel it, hoping they learn when something is spilled milk, an opportunity,
    or a learning lesson.
