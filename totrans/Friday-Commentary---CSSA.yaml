    that the easy money days are finally coming to an end. China is well on its way
    down clearly signalling its intentions of cooling things off with the recent policy
    moves. FXI the big China ETF is now BELOW its 200 day moving average—to me that
    is a real sign that the bubble in China may have finally run its course. If that
    is the case, then this is terrible for commodities and US multi-nationals and
    overall very bad for the world economy which has become dependent on their  growth.
    The big banks have been big borrowers at the window speculating all over the world
    making free money, you can bet that this will scare some capital back home to
    the good old US dollar. It is a virtual guarantee that this money has found a
    home in commodities and speculative stocks. Take a look around you at the markets
    that have gone up the most, especially with the least fundamentals because these
    will be very vulnerable at some point quite soon. It is not yet a time to short
    the market on a long-term basis, but I feel that time may happen some time in
    2010\. Some additional technical signs are anectdotal–speculative fervor seems
    to be waning-STEC for example is one high-flyer during the rally that has just
    rolled over and died. Some signs are more quantitative: The US dollar (pointed
    out in late January on this blog) is above its 200-day moving average an gaining
    strength. The Russell 2000 is now leading the S&P500 which is not healthy historically.
    Other signs are fundamental: i) it seems that the banks are now under pressure
    from the government to potentially limit risk-taking, ii) the discount rate has
    been raised, iii) they are now starting to come under the microscope for sovereign
    loans/swaps, iv) they already are technically insolvent and hold massive sovereign
    liabilities in addition to bad mortgages to US consumers, and poor credit card
    books.'

    situation. My all-time  best discretionary  results have flowed from theory matched
    with confirmation. Relative strength and long-term technical trends are a sure
    sign that the market is backing you up on whatever crazy ideas you might have.
    Tonight I reviewed **Market Rewind’s Rotation Model** which I have to confess
    is my new favorite toy and has kept me up really late putting it through the paces
    ( a couple posts will be posted soon to show you how to best utilize this model)
    [http://marketrewind.blogspot.com/2010/02/etf-rewind-announcing-customizable.html](http://marketrewind.blogspot.com/2010/02/etf-rewind-announcing-customizable.html).
    It allows you to put in any ten stocks, ETFs or asset classes into a portfolio
    and uses a highly-refined algorithm to rank then from strongest to weakest. You
    can also see a backtest of how this model performed over a 3-year period. Considering
    it is a long only model, the results are extraordinary through this highly difficult
    period. This is the kind of model that is absolutely critical to validate your
    fundamental views/opinions BEFORE making trades. The advantage to the REWIND algorithm
    is that it adapts a lot faster than most standard models, and this allows you
    to catch moves a lot quicker.

  zh: 这些观点促使我研究如何最好地利用这种情况。我所有时间最好的自由裁量结果都来自于理论与确认的匹配。相对强度和长期技术趋势都是市场正在支持你的迹象，无论你可能有多疯狂的想法。今晚我审查了**Market
    Rewind的轮换模型**，我不得不承认这是我的新宠，一直让我排除了很晚才将其投入实践（几篇文章很快会贴出来，向你展示如何最好地利用这个模型）[http://marketrewind.blogspot.com/2010/02/etf-rewind-announcing-customizable.html](http://marketrewind.blogspot.com/2010/02/etf-rewind-announcing-customizable.html)。它允许你在组合中放入任意十支股票、ETF或资产类别，并使用一种经过精心调整的算法来对其进行从强到弱的排序。你还可以查看此模型在3年期间的回测情况。考虑到这是一个只看多头的模型，这些结果在这个非常困难的时期是非凡的。这是绝对关键的模型，可以在做交易之前验证你的基本观点/意见。这种REWIND算法的优势在于它比大多数标准模型更快地适应，这使你可以更快地捕捉到行情走势。
- en: 'It is also the kind of model that is critical to stabilizing your portfolio
    and ensuring long-term success—-as many readers know, I am biased against an overly
    short-term focus because of all the pitfalls involved in succeeding. I am not
    aware of anyone who has been financially demolished using a multi-asset rotation
    model. Furthermore, the returns and risk-adjusted returns are nothing to sneeze
    at and rival good swing trading models. When you consider commissions, slippage, and
    taxes, the rotation model is the clear winner. So note to traders: if you haven’t
    been winning consistently for years, **this is your bedrock**–everything else
    is risk capital that must be budgeted wisely to ensure you don’t wipe yourself
    out.  Currently the top positions in my own multi-asset class portfolio were Canadian
    Real Estate (XRE.TO)–igloos are going for high prices these days!, the US Dollar
    (UUP), and Cash (SHY).  The short positions I put into the model to create a complete
    dynamic timing approach were not in the top 3 indicating that it is premature
    to go full bear.'

  zh: 这也是稳定你的投资组合并确保长期成功的关键模式——正如许多读者所知，我倾向于反对过于短期的关注，因为成功中存在着许多陷阱。我没有听说有人在使用多资产轮换模型时发生过财务灾难。此外，收益和风险调整后的收益也是令人瞩目的，并且可以与良好的摆动交易模型匹敌。当考虑佣金、滑点和税收时，轮换模型是明显的赢家。因此，交易者请注意：如果你多年来一直没有稳定地取得胜利，**这就是你的基石**——其他一切都是风险资本，必须明智地预算，以确保你不会让自己陷入困境。目前，我自己多资产类组合的头寸是加拿大房地产（XRE.TO）–
    igloos这些天价格很高！，美元（UUP）和现金（SHY）。我将在模型中放入的的空头限令以形成一个完整的动态定时方法，这些并未跻身前三名，表明目前过早做空还为时过早。
