    office support teams often bemoan the hassle of supporting myriad sheets, all
    a spaghetti mixture of various internal and external plugins and trader coded
    VB. Whole lines of business get built on spreadsheets, and replacing them with
    robust apps soaks up many developer years.

    may try to eliminate them. The reason is simple: Excel is the traders’ preferred
    development platform. Yet at the same time, it’s a general purpose tool, quite
    ill suited for trading apps. I’ve long thought that a determined start up could
    make a killing by building a better spreadsheet for the trading floor.'

    with IronPython for desktop etrading apps, I was excited to discover [Resolver
    Systems](http://www.resolversystems.com/). The Resolver is an IronPython .Net
    based spreadsheet that supports injection of Python scripts. I hope the Resolver
    guys are thinking about multi threading and serverisation as well as integration
    with existing .Net based Excel addins. Multi threading and server side capability
    would allow serverisation of trader coded pricing, and support for existing .Net
    addins would enable Resolver sheets to plug into market data infrastructures etc.

    furthering the cause of Python on the trading floor.
