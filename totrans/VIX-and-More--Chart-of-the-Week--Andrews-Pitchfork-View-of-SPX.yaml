- en: I occasionally feature charts with an [Andrews Pitchfork](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Andrews%20Pitchfork)
    in my subscriber newsletter and I am always surprised by how favorable the reaction
    is. I am not sure why this is the case, but my hunch is that part of the reason
    has to do with the relative rarity of Andrews Pitchfork charts.

    to evaluating the recent movements in stocks, I elected to take a Neptunian approach
    with the Andrews Pitchfork below.

    incorporates four years of weekly SPX bars in order to capture the full extent
    of the fall from the 2007 highs to the 2009 lows in order to put the recent rise
    in perspective.

- en: As the chart shows, the Andrews Pitchfork has captured almost perfectly the
    slope (at least as shown on the semi-log scale below) of the rally in stocks over
    the course of the last ten weeks. Note that in order for the Andrews Pitchfork
    to continue to be relevant, stocks will have to continue to rise at their recent
    rate in order to stay above the bottom prong, which means that looking forward,
    this graphic will likely have a short half-life.

    and sustainability of continuation moves. The slope of the current strikes me
    as unsustainable, but it will be interesting to see how long the current trend
    can last.
