    Follows Markets Down in Early Trading](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/03/vix-follows-markets-down-in-early.html),
    it is rare for the VIX to drop when the S&P 500 is down and rarer still for the
    VIX to be down when the SPX is down 1% or more.  In fact, when the SPX closed
    down 1.15% yesterday and the VIX ended the day down 0.77%, it was only the second
    time since April 2003 that the VIX gave up ground on a day in which the SPX lost
    more than 1%.'

- en: Looking at all 22 times since 1990 in which the VIX has been down on the same
    day that the SPX has posted a 1% loss yields an interesting clustering of data.  The
    first 10 instances are clustered in 1990 and early 1991 and are associated with
    all of the uncertainty leading up to the [Gulf War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War).  After
    a nine year hiatus – the famous 1990s bull market – the next clustering of data
    consists of ten instances from May 2000 through April 2003, roughly from the beginning
    of the bursting of the [dot-com bubble](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_com_bubble)
    to the point where the markets began to confirm a bottom with a series of higher
    highs.

- en: The most recent example of the VIX falling on a day in which the SPX was down
    1% or more comes from January 4, 2005 and was largely the result of the fallout
    associated with the magnitude 9.3 [Indian Ocean earthquake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake).  This
    was the second largest earthquake ever recorded (at least on a seismograph) and
    together with the resulting tsunami, was responsible for over 200,000 deaths.

- en: It remains to be seen whether tectonic forces were responsible for the unusual
    VIX and SPX action yesterday.  History suggests that these days can occur at either
    the beginning or the end of a bear market.  While the SPX has generally outperformed
    historical norms in the weeks following a 1% drop in the SPX accompanied by a
    negative VIX, history also suggests that a safer conclusion to draw from a day
    like yesterday is increasing volatility around the corner.
