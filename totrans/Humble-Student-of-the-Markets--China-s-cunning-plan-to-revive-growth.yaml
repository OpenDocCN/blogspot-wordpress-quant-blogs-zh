    growth through a combination of the adroit utilization of cheap surplus labor
    and financial repression, which financed much of the infrastructure required for
    its initial growth phase. In the wake of the Great Recession, Beijing unleashed
    a shock-and-awe monetary and fiscal stimulus campaign of credit fueled infrastructure
    spending. And boy, did the economy respond.

    growth. At the same time, it would gradually open up its capital account and do
    away with financial repression, which financed the growth surge of the last twenty
    years on the back of the household sector. But re-balancing growth means slower
    growth - and slower growth will increase social pressures. If uncontrolled, social
    pressures have the potential to undermine the Party's legitimacy. Taken to its
