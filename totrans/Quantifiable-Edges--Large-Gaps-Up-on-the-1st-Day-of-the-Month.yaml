- en: '"Gap Guy" Scott Andrews took some interesting looks at gaps that occured on
    the 1st day of the month. Of course since he posted it early he couldn''t have
    known we were about to get such a large gap up. Inspired by Scott I took a look
    at other 1% gaps that occured on the 1st day of the month. I''ve listed all instances
    below.'
