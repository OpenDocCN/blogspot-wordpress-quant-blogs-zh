- en: If you listen to the first 20 seconds of this clip, you'll hear a simple proposition
    about risk and return from a top-rate finance professor, John Geanakoplos. The
    problem is, though it isn't really clear, he is talking about a risk akin to a
    default rate, and a return like a stated yield.  It's not really central to this
    particular lecture, but its the kind of throw-away assertion that highlights experts
    take the risk premium for granted, even though it's as common as a jackalope for
    your average investor.

- en: 'also presents the seemingly straightforward example of how bonds with higher
    default rates have higher yields: risk and expected return are positively correlated.
    Yet this is purely an anticipation of the default rates so is not risk in the
    sense of something priced. BBB bonds have, over time, the same total return as
    B-rated bonds, in spite of the fact that yields for B-rated bonds are always higher
    than for BBB-rated bonds. One must subtract the expected defaults and the resulting
    losses from a stated yield regardless of one’s risk tolerance. Confusing stated
    yield with return is a simple, obvious error. This is the kind of rationalization
    people make when they are certain their big picture is correct. The distinction
    between the amortized expected loss from defaults and priced risk is a fundamental
    distinction in modern risk-return theory. The usage of expected loss risk as opposed
    to ''risk premium'' risk when it generates intuitive support at 30,000 feet suggests
    that financial professionals have a strong, active bias toward the big idea: risk
    begets average returns.'

- en: 'Geanakoplos''s  theory, btw, is best highlighted by his takeaway: write down
    the principal on all problem mortgages by 50%.  This saves money because banks
    expect to get only 25% in the current morass.  The moral hazard of this solution
    is rather stark, as its unclear why anyone current on a mortgage should not immediate
    cease paying until he gets the 50% gift.  He has a hedge fund.'
