    true and important insight of that model, it was merely an elegant rationalization
    of some stylized facts that has zero predictive power and is 99% orthogonal to
    anything he himself actually discusses about economics. I glad to see he sees
    the pointlessness of such parochial models. Will he give back his Nobel Prize?

    require a much deeper understanding of three areas that interest me. One, we need
    a better understanding of the interlinkages across countries in trade, finance,
