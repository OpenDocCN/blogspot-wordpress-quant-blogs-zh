    still growing at twice the rate of nominal gross domestic product. The anti-corruption
    campaign unleashed by President Xi Jinping is sapping growth and initiative and
    stifling economic reforms. As a recent World Bank report suggested, China’s capacity

    flashed buy signals, or are we in the choppy period after the big fall in August,
