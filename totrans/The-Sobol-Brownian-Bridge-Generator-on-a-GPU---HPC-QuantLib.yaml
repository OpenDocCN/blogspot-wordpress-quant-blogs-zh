    them in the same way as one uses pseudo random numbers. The real advantage of
    quasi Monte-Carlo shows up only after

    of dimensions of the problem. If one is using significantly less samples then
    it becomes very likely that the results are totally wrong. Therefore a dimensional
    reduction of the problem is often the first step when applying quasi Monte-Carlo
    methods.

- en: The Brownian bridge is tailor-made to reduce the number of significant dimensions
    of a Monte-Carlo integration of a stochastic differential equation  In his recent
    text-book [1] Mark Joshi shows how to use Brownian bridges efficiently for quasi
    Monte-Carlo pricing and he also outlines the QuantLib implementation. It has been
    shown in [3] that the overall statistical error of a structured equity portfolio
    has been reduced by a factor of three when switching from a pseudo random number
    generator to a Sobol Brownian bridge generator, which in turn means a speed-up
    factor of nine leaving the Monte Carlo error unchanged.

- en: An efficient implementation of a Sobol Brownian bridge generator is therefore
    a standard building block for quasi Monte-Carlo option pricing. A [CUDA 4.2](http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_home_new.html)
    implementation for nVIDIA GPUs based on [QuantLib 1.2](http://quantlib.org) is
    available [here](http://hpc-quantlib.de/src/gpubrownianbridge.zip). The interface
    and usage are closely related to QuantLib’s Sobol Brownian bridge generator for
    CPUs. The memory layout of the results on the GPU is CURAND_ORDERING_QUASI_DEFAULT.
    The zip file also contains a validation program, which checks that both versions
    of the Sobol Brownian bridge are generating the same results.
