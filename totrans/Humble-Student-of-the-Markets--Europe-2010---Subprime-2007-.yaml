    solutions to sovereign debt crises would not work in Europe. When a country gets
    into trouble and asks the IMF for help, the usual package is to offer loan assistance
    in return for the demands that the country goes on a fiscal diet (cut spending
    drastically) and get a job, any job (currency devaluation). Devaluation, it is
    believed, gives the economy a shot of export adrenaline and the reduced spending
    puts the budget in better shape to benefit from the export jolt. In the case if
    the PIIGS, devaluation isn't possible, so only fiscal austerity is left to support
    any adjustments. Even the post-crisis pains that we have seen in places in Argentina,
    Indonesia and Malyasia won't be enough in the wake of the lack of currency devaluation.
