- en: I actually received a large volume of what could best be chararcterized as “hate
    mail” for one of the previous [posts](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2015/01/26/a-simple-tactical-asset-allocation-portfolio-with-percentile-channels/
    "A Simple Tactical Asset Allocation Portfolio with Percentile Channels") on percentile
    channels. In reading these comments I was reminded of Jimmy Kimmel’s funny segments
    where celebrities read mean tweets about themselves. While I did not publish these
    comments (I do not wish to alienate or prohibit those people who are kind enough
    to comment on the blog), needless to say most of them implied that I had presented
    a fraudulent strategy that badly misrepresented true performance. Since exact
    details were not provided on the strategy this is a difficult claim to justify.
    As a mountain of such comments piled in, I decided that it would be useful at
    this time to clarify how the allocations were calculated. The initial strategy
    was developed using a pre-built testing platform in VBA, so presenting the details
    for how the strategy calculates positions is easier than taking the time to build
    it in a spreadsheet.

    1) this is a blog for **new ideas** to inspire new strategies not for sharing
    code or spoon-feeding people with recipes 2) people actually pay money for strategies
    in the quantitative investment business, and giving one away for free seems like
    a pretty good deal. Who ever complains about free food? Hint: No one. 3) whenever
    I post strategies or indicators I get flooded with demands for spreadsheets and
    code. The tone of such emails is often terse or even desperate and implies that
    I have some sort of obligation to assist readers with replication or implementation
    on their end. Since the blog is free and competes for my often limited time while
    engaging in unrelated but paid business activities, meeting such demands is difficult
    to justify. I would comment that even the authors of academic articles to reputable
    journals rarely provide either: a) easy instructions for replication–in fact it
    is notoriously difficult to replicate most studies since either the instructions
    are vague or details are missing or b) assistance/support— authors rarely if ever
    provide assistance with replication and rarely answer such requests, even when
    their articles are supposed to contribute to some body of research (unlike a blog).
    I would like to think that CSSA has been considerably more generous over the years.'

    doing your own homework and using your own brain”– perhaps a novel concept to
    those who simply wish to coast of the hard work and individual thinking of others.
    So without turning this into a prolonged rant, here is a “simple” (I will refrain
    from using that word in the future after the latest experience) schematic of how
    allocations are calculated for the strategy:'

- en: A couple key details first- the strategy was rebalanced monthly (allocations
    calculated and held through the month) and not daily. Also, the strategy is LONG
    ONLY. This means that any negative positions are ignored. The channel score or
    signals in the initial calculation can be long or short ie 1 or -1\. This is probably
    the key reason why readers were unable to replicate since they probably used 1
    or 0.

- en: Notice that negative positions are used to calculate allocations but are ignored
    in the final calculations. Furthermore, the cash position is allocated as an excess
    to the total of active allocations and not included in the risk parity position
    sizing (which would make SHY a huge position due to its low volatility). So I
    hope that this helps reader’s implement/duplicate the strategy. Keep in mind that
    prior to 2006, some of the ETFs used had to be extended with other data which
    reader’s may not have access to. However, using ETF data only yields a sharpe
    ratio of about 1.5\. Beyond this- readers are on their own. Good Luck!
