    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    as stock prices fell. These difficult period illustrate the need for an investment
    process. In bull phases, no one needs a process because the market is rising,
    When the market declines, however, investors and traders need to have laid out
    a decision process that details an analytical framework of what to do ahead of
    time. Otherwise, they wind up panicking because they either under or over-react

    prices to retreat. That`s because, after the fast money hedge funds and nimble
    traders sell, the slow institutional behemoths still have to evaluate the situation
    and act.  Institutional funds represent the Big Money. While they may not make
    investment shifts very often, when they do move, the fund flows are enormous,
    unrelenting and glacial.
