    who has worked from within the economic mainstream (especially where methods are
    concerned) but has not been afraid to accept logical conclusions that go against
    conventional wisdom, which is often not actually supported by any logic or theory.
    As he says,

    conclusions I reach. Many of my colleagues think of me as excessively dirigiste,
    or perhaps anti-market. A colleague at Harvard’s Economics Department would greet
    me by saying “how is the revolution going?” every time he saw me. A peculiar deformation
    of mainstream economics is the tendency to pooh-pooh the real-world relevance
    of all the theoretical reasons market fail and government intervention is desirable.'

    built their entire careers on “anomalous” results who are at the same time the
    greatest defenders of free trade. You get growth and development economists whose
    stock in trade are models with externalities of all kinds who are stern advocates
    of the Washington Consensus. When you question these policy conclusions, you typically
    get a lot of hand-waving. Well, the government is corrupt and in the pockets of
    rent-seekers. It does not have enough information to undertake the right kinds
    of interventions anyhow. Somehow, the minds of these analytically sophisticated
    thinkers turn into mush when they are forced to take seriously the policy implications
    of their own models.

    policy conclusions generally supported by the economic mainstream (deregulation,
    more markets, etc.) actually find no real foundation in theory. Yet many economists
    support these conclusions anyway for other reasons. He goes on to talk about the
    social forces within the profession:'

    and the socialization process that tend to push economists to think alike. Most
    economists start graduate school not having spent much time thinking about social
    problems or having studied much else besides math and economics. The incentive
    and hierarchy systems tend to reward those with the technical skills rather than
    interesting questions or research agendas. An in-group versus out-group mentality
    develops rather early on that pits economists against other social scientists.
    All economists tend to imbue a set of values that tends to glorify the market
    and demonize public action.

    of markets and their belief that the market logic will eventually vanquish whatever
    obstacle is placed on its path. As a result, economists tend to look down on other
    social scientists, as those distant, less competent cousins who may ask interesting
    questions sometimes but never get the answers right. Or, if their answers are
    right, they are so not for the methodologically correct reasons. Even economists
    who come from different intellectual traditions are typically treated as “not
    real economists” or “not serious economists.”

    path are pretty high. Above all, they must play by the methodological rules of
    the profession. That means using the language of mathematics, the standard optimizing,
    general-equilibrium frameworks, and the established econometric tools. They must
    pay their dues and demonstrate they remain card-carrying members in good standing.

    reasons. But what he then says is most interesting, touching back on the point
    of how widely held policy views link back to actual economic theory. Often, he
    suggests, they have no foundation at all in such theory, which is often employed
    more as a rhetorical tool than anything else:'

    become a caricature of what sounds economics teaches us. I wasn’t doing anything
    more than reminding my colleagues about standard economic theory and empirics.
    It was like pushing on an open door. I wasn’t challenging the economics, but the
    sociology of the profession. For example, when I first began to criticize the
    Washington Consensus, I thought I was doing the obvious. The simple rules-of-thumb
    around which the Consensus revolved had no counterpart in serious welfare economics.
    Neither were they empirically well supported, in view of East Asia’s experience
    with heterodox economic models. When you questioned supporters closely, you first
    got some very partial economic arguments as response, and then as a last resort
    some political hand-waving (e.g., “we need to get the government to stop doing
    such things, otherwise rent-seeking will be rife…”). My argument was that we should
    take economics (and political economy) more seriously than simply as rules of
    thumb. Economics teaches us to think in conditional terms: different remedies
    are required by different constraints. That way of thinking naturally leads us
    to a contextual type of policy-making, a diagnostic approach rather than a blueprint,
    kitchen-sink approach.'

    globalization I was simply reminding the profession what economics teaches. Take
    for example the relationship between the gains from trade and the distributive
    implications of trade. To this day, there is a tendency in the profession to overstate
    the first while minimizing the second. This makes globalization look a lot better:
    it’s all net gains and very little distributional costs. Yet look at the basic
    models of trade theory and comparative advantage we teach in the classroom and
    you can see that the net gains and the magnitudes of redistribution are directly
    linked in most of these models. The larger the net gains, the larger the redistribution.
    After all, the gains in productive efficiency derive from structural change, which
    is a process that inherently creates gainers (expanding sectors and the factors
    employed therein) and losers (contracting sectors and the factors employed therein).
    It is nonsensical to argue that the gains are large while the amount of redistribution
    is small – at least in the context of the standard models. Moreover, as trade
    becomes freer, the ratio of redistribution to net gains rises. Ultimately, trying
    to reap the last few dollars of efficiency gain comes at the “cost” of significant
    redistribution of income. Again, standard economics.'

    well the reception I got when I presented my paper (with Francisco Rodriguez)
    on the empirics of trade policy and growth. The literature had filled up with
    extravagant claims about the effect of trade liberalization on economic growth.
    What we showed in our paper is that the research to date could not support those
    claims. Neither the theoretical nor empirical literature indicated there is a
    robust, predictable, and quantitatively large effect of trade liberalization on
    growth. We were simply stating what any well-trained economist should have known.
    Nevertheless, the paper was highly controversial. One of my Harvard colleagues
    asked me in the Q&A session: “why are you doing this?” It was a stunning question.
    It was as if knowledge of a certain kind was dangerous.'

    been surprised at some of the reaction along similar lines. I expected of course
    that many policy advocates would be hostile. But my arguments were, or so I thought,
    based solidly on economic theory and reasoning. A distinguished economist wrote
    back saying “you are giving ammunition to the barbarians.” In other words, I had
    to exercise self-censorship lest my arguments were used by protectionists! The
    immediate qestion I had was why this economist thought barbarians were only on
    one side of the debate. Was he unaware of how, for example, multinational firms
    hijacked pro-free trade arguments to lobby for agreements – such as intellectual
    property – that had nothing to do with free trade? Why was it that the “barbarians”
    on one side of the issue were inherently more dangerous than the “barbarians”
    on the other side?

    too far is that you are eventually proved right. The Washington Consensus is essentially
    dead, replaced by a much more humble approach that recognizes the importance of
    locally binding constraints. And many of the arguments I made about the contingent
    nature of the benefits from trade and financial globalization are much closer
    to the intellectual mainstream today than they were at the time.
