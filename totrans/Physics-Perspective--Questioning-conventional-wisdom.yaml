    who has worked from within the economic mainstream (especially where methods are
    concerned) but has not been afraid to accept logical conclusions that go against
    conventional wisdom, which is often not actually supported by any logic or theory.

- en: '...where I tend to part company with many of my colleagues is with the policy
    conclusions I reach. Many of my colleagues think of me as excessively dirigiste,
    or perhaps anti-market. A colleague at Harvard’s Economics Department would greet
    me by saying “how is the revolution going?” every time he saw me. A peculiar deformation
    of mainstream economics is the tendency to pooh-pooh the real-world relevance
    of all the theoretical reasons market fail and government intervention is desirable.'

    built their entire careers on “anomalous” results who are at the same time the
    greatest defenders of free trade. You get growth and development economists whose
    stock in trade are models with externalities of all kinds who are stern advocates
    of the Washington Consensus. When you question these policy conclusions, you typically
    get a lot of hand-waving. Well, the government is corrupt and in the pockets of
    rent-seekers. It does not have enough information to undertake the right kinds
    of interventions anyhow. Somehow, the minds of these analytically sophisticated
    thinkers turn into mush when they are forced to take seriously the policy implications
    of their own models.

- en: 'This is an interesting point. In essence, he is suggesting that some of the
    policy conclusions generally supported by the economic mainstream (deregulation,
    more markets, etc.) actually find no real foundation in theory. Yet many economists
    support these conclusions anyway for other reasons. He goes on to talk about the
    social forces within the profession:'

  zh: 这是一个有趣的观点。本质上，他是在建议一些通常得到经济学主流支持的政策结论（如去监管，更多市场等）实际上在理论中找不到真正的依据。然而，许多经济学家还是因为其他原因支持这些结论。他接着谈到了该领域内的社会力量：
- en: There are powerful forces having to do with the sociology of the profession
    and the socialization process that tend to push economists to think alike. Most
    economists start graduate school not having spent much time thinking about social
    problems or having studied much else besides math and economics. The incentive
    and hierarchy systems tend to reward those with the technical skills rather than
    interesting questions or research agendas. An in-group versus out-group mentality
    develops rather early on that pits economists against other social scientists.
    All economists tend to imbue a set of values that tends to glorify the market
    and demonize public action.

  zh: 与该职业的社会学以及社会化过程有关的强大力量倾向于推动经济学家们思考方式相似。大多数经济学家在开始研究生学习时，并没有花太多时间思考社会问题，或者除了数学和经济学之外并没有学习太多其他内容。激励和等级制度往往奖励那些具有技术技能的人，而不是有趣的问题或研究议程。一个内群体与外群体的心态在早期就发展起来，将经济学家与其他社会科学家对立起来。所有经济学家都倾向于灌输一组倾向于赞美市场、妖魔化公共行动的价值观。

    of markets and their belief that the market logic will eventually vanquish whatever
    obstacle is placed on its path. As a result, economists tend to look down on other
    social scientists, as those distant, less competent cousins who may ask interesting
    questions sometimes but never get the answers right. Or, if their answers are
    right, they are so not for the methodologically correct reasons. Even economists
    who come from different intellectual traditions are typically treated as “not
    real economists” or “not serious economists.”

  zh: 主流经济学家可能最突出的是他们对市场力量的敬畏和他们的信念，即市场逻辑最终会克服置于其道路上的任何障碍。因此，经济学家往往看不起其他社会科学家，认为他们是遥远、能力较弱的同辈，有时可能会问出有趣的问题，但永远得不到正确的答案。或者，如果他们的答案是对的，那也不是因为方法论上的正确原因。即使来自不同知识传统的经济学家通常也被视为“不是真正的经济学家”或“不严肃的经济学家”。

    path are pretty high. Above all, they must play by the methodological rules of
    the profession. That means using the language of mathematics, the standard optimizing,
    general-equilibrium frameworks, and the established econometric tools. They must
    pay their dues and demonstrate they remain card-carrying members in good standing.

- en: 'Now, Rodrik does suggest that he likes to work within this framework for various
    reasons. But what he then says is most interesting, touching back on the point
    of how widely held policy views link back to actual economic theory. Often, he
    suggests, they have no foundation at all in such theory, which is often employed
    more as a rhetorical tool than anything else:'

  zh: 现在，罗德里克确实表示他喜欢在这个框架内工作，原因有很多。但他随后所说的最有趣，回到了广泛持有的政策观点如何与实际经济理论相联系的问题。他建议，通常这些观点在理论中根本没有基础，而更多的是作为一种修辞工具而非其他：
- en: 'In my own case, every piece of conventional wisdom I challenged had already
    become a caricature of what sounds economics teaches us. I wasn’t doing anything
    more than reminding my colleagues about standard economic theory and empirics.
    It was like pushing on an open door. I wasn’t challenging the economics, but the
    sociology of the profession. For example, when I first began to criticize the
    Washington Consensus, I thought I was doing the obvious. The simple rules-of-thumb
    around which the Consensus revolved had no counterpart in serious welfare economics.
    Neither were they empirically well supported, in view of East Asia’s experience
    with heterodox economic models. When you questioned supporters closely, you first
    got some very partial economic arguments as response, and then as a last resort
    some political hand-waving (e.g., “we need to get the government to stop doing
    such things, otherwise rent-seeking will be rife…”). My argument was that we should
    take economics (and political economy) more seriously than simply as rules of
    thumb. Economics teaches us to think in conditional terms: different remedies
    are required by different constraints. That way of thinking naturally leads us
    to a contextual type of policy-making, a diagnostic approach rather than a blueprint,
    kitchen-sink approach.'

  zh: 在我自己的情况下，我所挑战的每一个传统智慧观念，在主流经济学中已经被教导成了一个荒谬的版本。我所做的不过是提醒同事们关于标准经济学理论和实证研究。这就像是在推一扇开着的门。我挑战的并不是经济学，而是这个行业的社会学。例如，当我刚开始批评华盛顿共识时，我以为我是在做显而易见的事情。共识围绕的简单经验法则在严肃的福利经济学中没有对应物。而且，考虑到东亚国家对非正统经济模型的经验，它们也没有得到实证支持。当你紧紧追问支持者时，你首先得到的是一些非常片面的经济论证作为回应，然后，作为最后的手段，他们做一些政治上的含糊其辞（例如，“我们需要让政府停止这样做，否则寻租行为将会泛滥……”）。我的观点是我们应该比仅仅把经济学（和政治经济学）当作经验法则更认真地对待经济学。经济学教给我们用条件性术语来思考：不同的约束需要不同的补救措施。这种思考方式自然而然地引导我们进行一种情境式的政策制定，一种诊断方法而不是一种蓝图式的、大杂烩的方法。

    globalization I was simply reminding the profession what economics teaches. Take
    for example the relationship between the gains from trade and the distributive
    implications of trade. To this day, there is a tendency in the profession to overstate
    the first while minimizing the second. This makes globalization look a lot better:
    it’s all net gains and very little distributional costs. Yet look at the basic
    models of trade theory and comparative advantage we teach in the classroom and
    you can see that the net gains and the magnitudes of redistribution are directly
    linked in most of these models. The larger the net gains, the larger the redistribution.
    After all, the gains in productive efficiency derive from structural change, which
    is a process that inherently creates gainers (expanding sectors and the factors
    employed therein) and losers (contracting sectors and the factors employed therein).
    It is nonsensical to argue that the gains are large while the amount of redistribution
    is small – at least in the context of the standard models. Moreover, as trade
    becomes freer, the ratio of redistribution to net gains rises. Ultimately, trying
    to reap the last few dollars of efficiency gain comes at the “cost” of significant
    redistribution of income. Again, standard economics.'

  zh: 同样地，当我质疑全球化好处的一些过分说法时，我只是在提醒同行们经济学教导我们什么。例如，贸易收益与贸易的分配含义之间的关系。时至今日，这个行业中仍然有一种倾向，即过分强调前者而最小化后者。这使得全球化看起来更加有利：一切都是净收益，几乎没有分配成本。然而，看看我们在课堂上教授的国际贸易理论和比较优势模型，你就会发现这些模型中净收益和再分配的规模是直接相关的。净收益越大，再分配的规模也越大。毕竟，生产效率的收益来源于结构变化，这是一个内在地创造了输家和赢家的过程（扩张部门及其所用要素，以及收缩部门及其所用要素）。在标准模型的背景下，争论收益很大而再分配的规模很小是没有意义的。此外，随着贸易变得更加自由，再分配与净收益的比例上升。最终，试图收获效率提升的最后几美元，需要付出收入再分配“成本”的代价。这同样是标准的经济学原理。

    well the reception I got when I presented my paper (with Francisco Rodriguez)
    on the empirics of trade policy and growth. The literature had filled up with
    extravagant claims about the effect of trade liberalization on economic growth.
    What we showed in our paper is that the research to date could not support those
    claims. Neither the theoretical nor empirical literature indicated there is a
    robust, predictable, and quantitatively large effect of trade liberalization on
    growth. We were simply stating what any well-trained economist should have known.
    Nevertheless, the paper was highly controversial. One of my Harvard colleagues
    asked me in the Q&A session: “why are you doing this?” It was a stunning question.
    It was as if knowledge of a certain kind was dangerous.'

    been surprised at some of the reaction along similar lines. I expected of course
    that many policy advocates would be hostile. But my arguments were, or so I thought,
    based solidly on economic theory and reasoning. A distinguished economist wrote
    back saying “you are giving ammunition to the barbarians.” In other words, I had
    to exercise self-censorship lest my arguments were used by protectionists! The
    immediate qestion I had was why this economist thought barbarians were only on
    one side of the debate. Was he unaware of how, for example, multinational firms
    hijacked pro-free trade arguments to lobby for agreements – such as intellectual
    property – that had nothing to do with free trade? Why was it that the “barbarians”
    on one side of the issue were inherently more dangerous than the “barbarians”
    on the other side?
