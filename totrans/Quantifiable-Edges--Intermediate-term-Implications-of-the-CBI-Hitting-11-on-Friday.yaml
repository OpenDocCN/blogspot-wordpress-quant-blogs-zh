    high readings before, except in the Subscriber Letter.  Below is a study from

    first CBI reading of 11+.  Drawdown stats are larger than most traders would prefer.
     Still, it appears a reading of this magnitude often suggests a washout is in
    progress that should set the stage for at least a multi-week bounce.  We may not
    reach the “final” bottom here, but this study indicates we should see at least
    a temporary bottom form soon.
