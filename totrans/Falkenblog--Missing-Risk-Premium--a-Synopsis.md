# Falkenblog: Missing Risk Premium: a Synopsis

> 来源：[http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2013/07/missing-risk-premium-synopsis.html#0001-01-01](http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2013/07/missing-risk-premium-synopsis.html#0001-01-01)

I recently made a presentation of my book,

[The Missing Risk Premium](http://www.amazon.com/Missing-Risk-Premium-Eric-Falkenstein/dp/1470110970/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1345223074&sr=1-1)

, and thought it was concise, so I'm sharing it here.

**Historical return data contradicting 'expected return positively linearly related to risk' theory:**

*   Within equities:

*   Firm leverage
*   Firm profitability
*   CAPM beta
*   Total Volatility
*   Residual Volatility
*   Financial Distress/Default metrics and equities
*   Penny stocks vs. regular stocks
*   IPOs vs regular stock
*   Country returns in developed countries
*   Country returns in emerging markets
*   Analyst disagreement across stocks

*   High vs. low trading volume
*   R rated movies vs. G rated movies
*   Volatility/future equity Index returns  over time
*   Overnight vs. Intraday stock returns
*   Bond credit: Distress, Junk, and  BBB-A rated Bonds
*   Bond duration: post 2 years
*   Out-of-the-money options vs. at-the-money options
*   S and C corps  vs. equity indexes
*   Senior vs. Subordinated
*   Reinsurance: rebalanced vs. peak peril
*   Converts: low and high moneyness
*   Merger Arbitrage: stock-financed vs. cash-financed
*   Lotto vs. ‘quick pick’ lotteries
*   50-1 horses vs. 3-1 horses
*   Mutual funds
*   Hedge Funds
*   Commodity Trading Advisors (CTAs)
*   Currencies
*   Futures
*   Real Estate

**Data consistent with Risk/Return theory:**

*   Short end of yield curve
*   BBB-Treasury credit spread
*   Top-line equity return over libo

**How high risk generates low premium:**

Winner’s curse: excess demand for volatile stocks generates below average returns
Why the extra demand?

*   Overconfidence
*   Information costs lower about risky firms
*   High returns have high risk, ergo risk implies higher return fallacy
*   Some are risk loving
*   Some people are positive skew loving
*   Alpha discovery
*   Easier sell to clients (amenable to stories)
*   Payoffs to fund managers

*   Bounded rationality  (think SML is positively sloping)
*   Agency problem (exploit option with fund source)

*   Those buying stocks think stocks will rise, in which case higher beta is better

**Why is Flat/downward SML  not arbitraged?**

*   Tradition (60-40 stock/equity ratio is a binding constraint)
*   Irrationality (others don’t notice SML flat/negative)
*   *Relative risk (my favorite, other consistent data below)*

*   Easterlin Paradox suggests happiness is relative
*   No one sells low risk, lower-than-average return stocks, because in a relative risk world, one only takes risk if the return is above average
*   home bias because you want to outcompete your peers, not strangers
*   Relative orientation evolutionarily robust compared to a Constant Relative Risk Aversion utility (which would be a strange coincidence)
*   Glucocorticoid levels such as cortisol related to status, not wealth
*   Imitation generally dominates figuring things out oneself (eg, fire, calculus), leading to an other-person directed brain
*   fMRI identifies neural mechanisms for empathy, social information
*   Status is a human universal, greed is not
*   Reverse dominance hierarchies in humans common (ie, status more important than wealth)
*   Politics about redistribution more than efficiency

**Counter: If Risk has no Premium, why take risk?**

*   40% of all men reproduce, where 80% of women do. 

*   Men have out-of-the-money option, need to take risk

*   Why not take infinite risk? Moderation in all things.

*   Life is a complex, nonlinear, dynamic game where every parameter has a local maximum. Radiation, vitamin A, oxygen, tolerance,  risk taking, can all be too much or too little.
