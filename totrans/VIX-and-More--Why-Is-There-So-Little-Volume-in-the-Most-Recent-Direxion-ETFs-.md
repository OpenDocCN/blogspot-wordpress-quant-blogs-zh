# VIX and More: Why Is There So Little Volume in the Most Recent Direxion ETFs?

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/02/why-is-there-so-little-volume-in-most.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/02/why-is-there-so-little-volume-in-most.html#0001-01-01)

It seems as if every day trader I know has fallen under the spell of the leveraged firepower of the [Direxion](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Direxion) [triple ETFs](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/triple%20ETFs). Oddly, only the [first batch](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/11/prediction-direxion-triple-etfs-will.html) of ETFs that were rolled out in November have caught fire. These include the familiar tickers like [FAS](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/FAS), [FAZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/FAZ), [TNA](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TNA), [TZA](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TZA), [BGU](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/BGU), [BGZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/BGZ), [ERX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/ERX) and [ERY](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/ERY).

The most recent group of ETFs, which I discussed in [Direxion Triple ETFs Add New Horses to Stable](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/01/direxion-triple-etfs-add-new-horses-to.html), has attracted considerably less interest. Even though they were launched at the end of December, only two of the six ETFs, [EDC](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EDC) and [TYH](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TYH), have surpassed the 100,000 single day volume mark and TYH just grazed that bar, with a high volume mark of 101,900\. In the chart below, a snapshot taken just past the halfway point of today’s session, the six new ETFs can be seen floundering at the bottom.

Juice is not the problem, as emerging markets (EDC and [EDZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EDZ)) and technology (TYH and [TYP](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TYP)) are consistently among the most volatile corners of the market.

The comments on [yesterday’s semi-rhetorical question](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/02/when-banks-and-spx-diverge-what-should.html) we excellent. Let’s see what sort of explanation the collective wisdom can come up with today.
