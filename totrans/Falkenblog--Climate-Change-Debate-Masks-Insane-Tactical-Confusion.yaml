    Liberals see this as a demonstrable scientific truth with obvious implications
    about energy conservation. Conservatives see it as a pretext for more Big Government.
    Liberals are generally winning the argument that climate change is human-caused--if
    winning means generating a majority vote of both the masses, and the elites.

    add-in mandates that have become huge subsidies for farmers), its now seen as
    counterproductive...by greens! If the rest of this list follows, it seems liberals
    are on the defensive on this issue, as they rationalize solutions based on hope,
    specifically, that current deficiencies in technologies such as solar will be
    rectified by sheer will like the moon landing.

    see something and say "why not", which sounds nice, but tends to dismiss the fact
    that the status quo has more fundamental drivers than a mere conspiracy by the
    captains of industry. For example, the common belief that
