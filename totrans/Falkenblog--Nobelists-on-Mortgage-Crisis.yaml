- en: A Nobel prize is usually awarded for some rather impressive, very particular
    modeling. Though they also have lots of publications, their prizes are generally
    for something insanely parochial. Stiglitz, Scholes, McFadden, all made such contributions.
    Their knowledge of the mortgage crisis is therefore predictably unenlightening

    is primarily the extreme events, not the average variability, especially in periods
    where everyone is trying to get out of a trade at the same time. In other words,
    he still has nightmares about LTCM foundering on an extreme event, where everyone
    knew LTCM's huge positions, and basically would not let them out at a price they
    could afford. Scholes did emphasize the costs of regulation, but did not have
    many specifics in regard to mortgages.

- en: Stiglitz just mentions more regulation is needed, noting that as the decline
    in income relative to trend, if you assume a unit root process for GDP, is about
    $1.5 trillion. Clearly, that implies a couple hundred billion on regulation is
    no big deal. But this presumes the money would be spent wisely. What were the
    regulators of the mortgage market focused on in 2006, prior to this crisis being
    created? They were not focused on underwriting standards. Indeed, the government
    was

    mainly for minorities. Only with hindsight would one think regulators would have
    nipped this in the bud. Otherwise, they would have been like Taleb, focusing on
    interest rate risk, or something else that could have gone wrong, but did not.

- en: Stiglitz betrays his bias by making the inconsistent point that all these poor
    people now lost their homes. But the problem was, they could not afford these
    homes. These are no-recourse loans, so they walk away, and the lenders have the
    loss. If one thinks lending was overdone, then these borrowers lost houses they
    should not have had anyway, and should not keep them. But Stiglitz is an economic
    redistributionist, in that he has a tendency to confabulate any rationale that
    effectively transfers wealth directly to the poor, or away from the rich.

- en: And then there's McFadden, who notes the precautionary principle, and asks that
    regulators adopt the approach of our drug regulators, to first prove an innovation
    does no harm. Of course, this is the regulation that would make aspirin a perscription
    drug if it were discovered today, and contains myriad warnings on every drug that
    serve only to cover their behinds, because it buries any important information
    in the page of 8-pt font outlining the things subjects reported (nausea, light
    headedness). That these guys have zero upside, and only downside, does not make
    for a social optimum.

- en: The productivity trend that Stiglitz takes for granted is predicated on lots
    of little innovation happening all the time. Innovation would be greatly diminished
    if it had to pass the precautionary principle. Better to accept these risks, rather
    than to get rid of these risks at the cost of zero growth.

    the change in underwriting criteria (no money down, no income verification, reverse
    amortization loans). The rating agencies, I think, were the weak link, because
    if something is rated AAA, I really can't blame risk management for not appreciating
    the probability this paper would, in aggregate, lose 50% of its value, because
    it is unprecendented. Once you start asking risk managers to apply unprecedented
    scenarios, then everything stops, because there are an infinite number of unprecedented
    adverse scenarios. The fall guy, therefore, should be agencies that did not adjust
    their models in light of these changes.
