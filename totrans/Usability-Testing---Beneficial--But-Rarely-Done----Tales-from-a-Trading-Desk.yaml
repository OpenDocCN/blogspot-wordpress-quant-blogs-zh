    on Usability Testing.  Financial application have got a lot better over the years
    with regards to engaging User Experience (UX) architects to design user interfaces. 
    Unfortunately, I still think the financial vertical is behind on seeing the benefit
    of usability testing, especially with regards to the reduction in development
    time based on testing the UX prior to development starting.
