    from purchases (BMWs), rhetorical styles (aping the coalitions rather arbitrary
    protocols), to charity (giving to causes that project well upon you). I''m very
    sympathetic to this view, in that we like a particular wine not merely because
    it tastes good, but because of what it represents, and what our appreciation of
    it represents.'

    be trying to climb the social hierarchy via such signals. Now comes Yale psychologist
    Paul Bloom with a new book

    is affected by what the person thinks is the true essence of the thing in question,
    and why prefer certain essential things. We like things that connect to our past,
    and to things that we think have some attractive, transcendent, property.

    choose things because we want to connect ourselves--our being, which includes
    what we have been--with things bigger than ourselves that are beautiful, true,
    or powerful. Thus, someone paid $750k for John F Kennedy's golf clubs, because
    it gets him closer to this famous great man. Or, kids prefer their teddy bear,
    not an identical substitute, because of a shared history. The implication is that
    context matters a lot, so things--ideas, objects--are never evaluated on a stand-alone
    basis. If true, it highlights that nothing is objective, because the context for
    everyone will be slightly different.
