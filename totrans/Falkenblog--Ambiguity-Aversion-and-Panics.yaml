- en: The rise in 'information sensitivity' across a broad cross-section of formerly
    informationally insensitive assets occurs due to fears of adverse selection, of
    buying an asset that is being sold because insiders know it is toxic. Yet it's
    interesting that when this occurs assets generally sell below their 'fair value'
    or 'net asset value' as they were in the winter of 2009, and people don't jump
    in and sieze this opportunity as they usually do.

    not clear less wealthy people are more risk averse than the more wealthy people.
    Is it just because they recently lost money? Consider the known fact that

    a lottery ticket is worth a lot less after the drawing for most people even if
    they don''t know what the true number is, and seemingly the seller does not either.
    People shy away from processes about which they think they have insufficient,
    as opposed to probabilistic, information, even if framed identically (eg, both
    with a 50% chance).'

    note they should have known better. Such criticisms are easier to counter after
    a pure risky choice, when a bad outcome is more easily explained as bad luck,
    than after an ambiguous choice. This explains the enhanced ambiguity aversion.
    Such social effects are called the fear of negative evaluation (FNE), basically,
    the fear of being evaluated a fool with hindsight.

- en: If a bad outcome were to result from a prospect about which an agent had relatively
    little knowledge his failure can be blamed on his incompetence. A bad outcome
    resulting from a pure risky prospect, on the other hand, cannot be attributed
    to poor judgment. All possible information about the risky prospect was known,
    and a failure is simply bad luck. The key is, ex post, will you look like a sucker,
    or just unlucky? Investment managers can live with bad luck, but their reputation
    is essential and they can't be seen a fool.

    had failures of Bear Stearns and Fannie Mae, two venerable institutions. It was
    not clear what the essence of the problem was--CDOs? Complexity? Banks? Mortgages?
    Copulas?--so investors simply knew that something was rotten, and it seem probable
    that some people knew what was going on, leaving one in the proverbial position
    of the guy at the poker table who doesn't know who the sucker is. This causes
    everyone to get alligator arms and jump into the least risky thing they can think
    of--the dollar, US Treasuries. With investment down, profits plummet, leading
    to a general recession.

    went well above any conceivable expected loss, we know it's a good time to invest
    because poor performance is never as bad as implied via risk-neutral probabilities,
    and it's better not to think of this as a 'risk premium' but rather an opportunity
    driven by people's ambiguity aversion.
