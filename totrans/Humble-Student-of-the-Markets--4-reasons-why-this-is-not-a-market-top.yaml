    done in the past rallies off V-shaped bottoms, the markets instead saw a Friday
    the 13th surprise sell-off. The bull trend was saved by a bounce off the uptrend
    line that began last October. In fact, a review of the charts, both within the
    US and globally, indicate that the bull trend is still intact. The chart below
    of global, US and European equity averages show a pattern of a pullback to successfully
    test the uptrend.

    the forward growth rate of the SP 500 earnings estimate going negative, I dont
    think we are anywhere close to a 2008-type scenario in the stock market. Despite
    the headline to this weekend’s update, I’m not that worried about SP 500 earnings.

    weakness in the context of intermediate term strength. Expectations have been
    beaten down and crowded short positions are being formed. On the other hand, there
    is little sign of intermediate term weakness, either from a technical or fundamental
    perspective.

    to the FOMC meeting is unpredicatable. However, I believe that downside risk is
    relatively limited. The SPX has the support of the uptrend line depicted below.
    Should that fail, recent episodes of weakness has been arrested at the 150 dma,
    which is about 1.5% below the levels seen on Friday.
