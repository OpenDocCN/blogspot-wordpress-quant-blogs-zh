    equity outlook. The most immediate is the approaching Q4 earnings season reports,
    which begins in earnest when the banks report earnings this coming Friday. Already,
    forward 12-month EPS are rolling over across the board for large, mid, and small-cap
    stocks. Upcoming corporate guidance will determine the degree of valuation pressure
    stocks will face in the coming weeks and months.
