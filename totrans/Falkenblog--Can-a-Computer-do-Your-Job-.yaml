    to me that they were the best able to spot potential in 18 year olds. In studies
    of expert performance admissions people are less good at predicting UG[undergrad]
    GPA than a simple algorithm. (The "algorithm" is simply a weighted sum of SAT
    and HS GPA!)

    their job was to evaluate the creditworthiness of loan applicants. Coming out
    of grad school, I had no experience with this, and they had this very complex,
    holistic methodology. Later, when I became head of capital allocations and we
    started quantifying their portfolios, I invariably found they could be replicated
    via some pretty simple rules. This got me excited about going to Moody''s to help
    develop their new RiskCalc Private firm model, which today dominates private firm
    underwriting worldwide. Anyway, the simple trick was always the same:'

    to exponential increases in expected default rates.

    (eg, auto lending, health care lending), was very misleading. Everyone made the
    simple complicated. I think deep down, no one likes to think a computer can do
    their job, and there are many instances where exceptions matter, so a great deal
    is made out of these special cases. Yet the false positives made them great anecdotes,
    but horrible for generalizations. Thus, simple rules dominate their much more
    costly, confusing, and non-quantitative product created by teams of analysts.

    knew would simply buy from a customer at the bid, and then sell to another customer
    at the ask, and go home 'making' $10k a day. They would then get a $500k annual
    bonus. A college admissions director probably interviews people all day, and writes
    pages of material supplementing their decisions, but all to trail a simple linear
    rule. I also worked in an econ department, where we created tons of forecasts
    with lots of commentary, all dominated by vector autoregressions. Our asset/liability
    committees would often have a lot of commentary about where various interest rates
    are going, as if these forecasts were any better than what could be lifted from
    forward prices.

    and would take a big pay cut if they started over, so its not as simple as just
    choosing a new career.
