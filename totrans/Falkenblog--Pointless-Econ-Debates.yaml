- en: A big point of contentions seems to be whether or not the 2008 slump was a 'financial-induced
    recession', because as Reinhart and Rogoff say these have slower-than-average
    recoveries, this benchmark then makes the current recovery look better; in contrast,
    compared to the average recession the recent recovery looks worse.

- en: My old mentor Hyman Minsky argued that most recessions are financially induced,
    from excessive leverage, creating a panic as investors stop rolling over debt
    and cash flow long-since became negative. The Ponzi borrower borrows based on
    the belief that the appreciation of the value of the asset will be sufficient
    to refinance the debt but could not make sufficient payments on interest or principal
    with the cash flow from investments; only the appreciating asset value can keep
    the Ponzi borrower afloat. This applies perfectly to many zero-down home buyers
    circa 2005-7.

    not 1945), and so there's at least one expert--of good faith, not ignorant--who
    disagrees

    Krugman says 73 and 81 were not 'financially induced' because they were orchestrated
    to combat inflation, a novel addition to the classification. Then they get into
    where to start the recovery, and how far out to go. When the debate gets into
    such semantics, it becomes pointless.

    to be angry as if their righteous indignation makes them more compelling, unaware
    that losing one's temper is a good signal you've lost the debate.
