    every investment professional that I know is seriously worried. However, there
    are a couple of voices of calm and hope in this maelstrom.

- en: With the S&P 500 trading below 1100, ***the U.S. stock market is now in the
    upper range of what I consider to be reasonable valuations***. Stocks are certainly
    not "cheap" or undervalued overall, but they are no longer priced to deliver unacceptably
    poor long-term returns. I have no strong belief that stocks have reached a bottom.
    Although there is an increasing likelihood of a sustained "bear market rally,"
    I believe there is a good chance that valuations will eventually move lower still
    before a durable cyclical low is established. Still, investors should recognize
    that normalized valuations are now the best they've been since 1995\. That may
    not be saying much, since the total return on the S&P 500 since 1995 has averaged
    only about 7% annually, but it is what we might call "the beginning of wisdom."

- en: When the news reports are uncontroversial in reporting that the U.S. is in recession,
    when they suggest that there is worse news ahead, and when they indicate that
    nothing seems to be helping, that is when the market is more likely to register
    its low.

- en: My assertion is not that we are necessarily at such a low yet, but the present
    sentiment of panic is typically one that presents useful opportunities for gradually
    scaling into market exposure, as uncomfortable as it might feel over the short
    term. ***This is what good investors get paid to do - not always immediately,
    but over time.***

    of the times when it buys a fair amount more. And so we use it.'

- en: Warren Buffett is focused on long-term value oriented and he will admit that
    he is not good a short-term timing. None of this indicates that the equity markets
    around the world will make a bottom this week or this month. They can continue
    to go down. However, these comments are powerful rays of hope for shell-shocked
    bulls.
