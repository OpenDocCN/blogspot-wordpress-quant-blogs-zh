    2 or DV2 readings give us little consolation when peering over at the abyss. I
    wanted to design a system that incorporated a variety of factors to maximize the
    probability of success, and minimize the probability of an extreme loss. I also
    wanted a system that would be in the market for as little time as possible. I
    call the system “SMR” because it combines  sentiment indicators along with  mean-reversion
    indicators. I define bear markets in this case as the SPY being below its 252-day
    average. Here are the system inputs:'

    equity curve is very smooth with an R-square of 88%.  The average hold is less
    than 1.1 days, and the maximum loss is only -4.4%.  There were only two trades
    that triggered two days in a row, and they were both winners.
