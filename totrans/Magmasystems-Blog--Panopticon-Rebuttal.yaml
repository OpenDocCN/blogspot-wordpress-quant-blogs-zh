    the free Microsoft TreeMap control to implement heatmaps. I also mentioned the
    fact that, for our needs, the Microsoft product seemed to suffice and that I did
    not see any immediate reason to buy the Panopticon product for heatmaps.

    is an SDK for embedding visual analysis and monitoring functionality into applications
    by means of integrating components such as interactive visualizations and a powerful
    data model capable of aggregating real-time data streams. The Microsoft Treemap
    control seems in to be considerably smaller and restricted in its API and designed
    to be used as a simple chart library and therefore for example does not include
    analytical functionality. Collateral posted at (public url at

    in relation to more traditional chart libraries.

    which provides very low ownership costs, extremely short time to market while
    preserving the functionality available in the SDK.

- en: Like any company, we have a budget that is tightly controlled. If Panopticon,
    or any third-party product, provides fiunctionality that will cost us more to
    develop ourselves, then the decision is to go to a third-party product. We like
    the fact that a third-party will support the product, but on the other hand, custom
    developing something ourselves gives us tight control over the feature set without
    having to wait for release cycles from a vendor. But, if we can take an existing
    free product and, with relatively little effort, modify it to do what we need,
    then I would be neglecting my fiduciary responsbility as an officer of the company
    to purchase a third-party product and pay a continuing stream of license and maintanence
    fees.

    us, and in addition to Panopticon, there are other fish out there like Fractal
    Edge (makers of what I like to call the Undulating Amoeba heatmap!)

    I would love to get your comments.
