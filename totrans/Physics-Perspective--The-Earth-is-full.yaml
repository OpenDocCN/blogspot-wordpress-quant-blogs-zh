    heresy, even though it has obvious malign consequences for the physical and biological
    environment on which we depend. In pursuing growth, we've increased our total
    throughput of raw materials and fuel by a factor of nearly 10 in the 20th century
    alone, increasing our spillage of degraded waste (including waste heat energy,
    see below) into the environment by a similar factor. So it is perhaps not at all

    real limits we face in CO2 emissions? Quite possibly or even probably the German
    decision was a feckless and emotional response in the wake of the Japanese Fukushima

    use as heat. Currently such energy plays a very small and largely insignificant
    role in the overall energy budget. But our energy use is growing at 2% per year
    globally, and in 100 or 150 years, they showed, will be enough to begin climate
    warming again, even in a dream world in which we control warming associated with
    CO2 emissions. The conclusion is that we will soon simply be using too much energy,
    which, by the laws of thermodynamics, will heat the Earth environment. We''re
    becoming too big. The Earth is too full -- of us. So, we might well switch to
    nuclear energy, and doing so might help us counter warming from CO2 for a time,
    but it doesn''t get us away from the rock bottom problem that we are (or will
    soon be) using and dissipating too much energy.  The abstract of the Cowern-Ahn
    paper describes the lesson of this analysis:'

    fluxes entering and leaving the climate system and arising within it. Humanity
    introduces temperature forcing through greenhouse gas emissions, agriculture,
    and thermal emissions from fuel burning. Up to now climate projections, neglecting
    thermal emissions, typically foresee maximum forcing around the year 2050, followed
    by a decline. In this paper we show that, if humanity's energy use grows at 1%/year,
    slower than in recent history, and if thermal emissions are not controlled through
    novel energy technology, temperature forcing will increase indefinitely unless
    combated by geo-engineering. Alternatively, and more elegantly, humanity may use
    renewable sources such as wind, wave, tidal, ocean thermal, and solar energy ***that
    exploit energy flows already present in the climate system***, or act as effective
    sinks for thermal energy.

    source of energy into play on Earth, by rapidly releasing energy which would otherwise
    be sequestered in nuclear forces for long periods of time. If we continue to increase
    our energy use, as growth enthusiasts assume we must, the only way to avoid climate
    warming will be to somehow counter our increased dissipation by reducing energy
    dissipation from other sources in the environment. Nuclear energy won't do that.
