  zh: 我们人类通过能源使用以热能形式向环境释放的能量量。目前，这种能量在整体能源预算中扮演的角色非常小，且意义不大。但是，全球能源使用以每年2%的速度增长，他们展示，在100到150年后，即使在一个我们控制了与二氧化碳排放相关的温暖的梦幻世界里，也将足够重新引发气候变暖。结论是，我们很快将简单地使用太多能量，根据热力学定律，这些能量将会加热地球环境。我们变得太大。地球太满了——充满了我们。所以，我们可能会转向核能，这样做可能会帮助我们暂时对抗由二氧化碳引起的温暖，但它并不能摆脱我们正在（或很快将）使用和释放太多能量的根本问题。Cowern-Ahn论文的摘要描述了这一分析的教训：
- en: Global warming arises from 'temperature forcing', a net imbalance between energy
    fluxes entering and leaving the climate system and arising within it. Humanity
    introduces temperature forcing through greenhouse gas emissions, agriculture,
    and thermal emissions from fuel burning. Up to now climate projections, neglecting
    thermal emissions, typically foresee maximum forcing around the year 2050, followed
    by a decline. In this paper we show that, if humanity's energy use grows at 1%/year,
    slower than in recent history, and if thermal emissions are not controlled through
    novel energy technology, temperature forcing will increase indefinitely unless
    combated by geo-engineering. Alternatively, and more elegantly, humanity may use
    renewable sources such as wind, wave, tidal, ocean thermal, and solar energy ***that
    exploit energy flows already present in the climate system***, or act as effective
    sinks for thermal energy.

    source of energy into play on Earth, by rapidly releasing energy which would otherwise
    be sequestered in nuclear forces for long periods of time. If we continue to increase
    our energy use, as growth enthusiasts assume we must, the only way to avoid climate
    warming will be to somehow counter our increased dissipation by reducing energy
    dissipation from other sources in the environment. Nuclear energy won't do that.
