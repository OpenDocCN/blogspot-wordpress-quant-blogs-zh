    I have always advocated linear regression over nonlinear models, but Kahneman
    went a step further. He said that in social science modeling (which of course
    includes financial markets modeling), assigning equal weights to the predictive
    factors is often superior to weighting them using multivariate linear regressors

    managers of acquirees. This overconfidence has several causes: there is an illusion
    of control which overemphasizes the role of skill and neglects the role of luck,
    and there is a focus on what one knows and a neglect of what one does not, etc.
    The market already knows this: the stock of the acquirer usually suffers a sell-off
    upon announcement of the acquisition, because the result of any acquisition is
    more often bad than good, but the question is whether it has sufficiently discounted
    this phenomenon. Would shorting the stock of an acquirer at the completion of
    an acquisition and holding the short position for, say, 5 years, hedging this
    position with SPY, be profitable?'

    history of how it has become an unmitigated financial disaster for you a few years
    from now. This will likely reveal scenarios that you have not previously thought
    of, and triggering additional risk management measures.

    ever extended this holding period when the position is losing, in the hope that
    the position will recoup some of its losses? I have, and the result was double
    the loss I would have suffered had I exited on time. Apparently this is a very
    common suboptimal behavioral bias: this is why many defendants with a weak legal
    case often risk continued litigations instead of accepting an unfavorable settlement.'

    can only be compensated by the pleasure of winning $2\. So if we equate standard
    deviation as the average drawdown of a strategy, then we need to have twice the
    average return!

    decisions and biased decisions that people commonly made. (For e.g. lottery franchises
    benefit from people overweighting the probability of winning, sellers of extended
    warranties benefit from buyers' risk-aversion.) I wonder if there are still opportunities
    left for rational traders to take advantage of the biased decisions of irrational
    traders?
