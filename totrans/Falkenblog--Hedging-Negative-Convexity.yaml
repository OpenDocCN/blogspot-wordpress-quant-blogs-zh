- en: Automated market makers (AMMs) invariably present their Liquidity Providers
    (LPs) with convexity costs. Hedging does not eliminate or even reduce these costs
    but it does lower volatility. With lower cost volatility, an LP does not need
    as much capital to cover these losses, so considering capital is expensive, it
    is correct to say hedging reduces costs, though only indirectly.

    units of liquidity, his initial LP position would look as in Table 1 below.

    a volatility assumption into an up-and-down move in the lattice. In practice,
    one uses many little steps, but we will show a large 10% movement for illustrative
    purposes. One can use the following formulas to create an arbitrage-free recombining
    lattice. Here, we will assume zero drift, or an expected token A return of zero.

    move up or down. Given an up move is the reciprocal of a down move, up*down=1,
    the center node just takes one back to the starting price. Note the probabilities
    are not 50% as the price movements are modeled as lognormally distributed (e.g.,
    exp(x)), so the probabilities adjust these asymmetric future prices to be consistent
    with the starting prices (E(p) = 100).

    involves applying the derivative formula to the various nodes with their distinct
    prices and then multiplying the derivative values in these nodes times their probability.
    In each period, here portrayed as a row, the probabilities add up to 1.0\. Below
    is a lattice applied to a v2 LP position initially hedged. The token A position
    in the pool is initially 77.7, so the initial hedge is short 77.7 units of token
    A.

    generate an LP loss, while the middle case, where the price is flat, has a probability
    of around 1/2\. If the LP did not hedge, he would see a gain in the 'up' state
    and a loss in the 'down' state, while in the hedged case, he would lose money
    in both states.

    and unhedged LP positions are identical (ignoring fees here, which would be unaffected
    by hedging). These are the payoffs and probabilities at the bottom of the lattice. However,
    the unhedged LP position varies by +/- 1500, while the hedged pnl varies by +/-
    $75.

    hedge is identical to the static hedge, so the LP's pnl is the same in period
    T=1 for both hedging strategies. However, in period T=1, the LP will adjust his
    hedge to match his new token A position, decreasing it in the up state from -77.7
    to -73.91 and increasing it to -81.68 in the down state. As the hedge is readjusted,
    to simplify accounting, we will realize the total pnl in period T=1\. The LP pnl
    is not actually realized, but putting the period 1 LP pnl onto the balance sheet
    makes it easy to see the effect of the hedge in the subsequent period.

    (expected loss is 19.40). The expected loss in the second period is 19.38, given
    that the initial loss was realized in period T=1, which is just the sum of the
    probabilities of these four states times their net pnls. The total expected loss
    over both periods is 38.79, identical to the static hedge.

    hedge reduces the pnl volatility: they do not change the total expected LP loss,
    totaling 38.79 whether unhedged, statically hedged, or constantly hedged. You
    multiply the pnls by their respective probabilities to get the expected value.'

    *p* after T periods, while if you hedge continuously, you will lose *x***p*/T
    each period. In the example above, the static hedge reduces the pnl variability
    from about +/- $1500 in the extreme states to +/- $75 with a static hedge, and
    the dynamic hedge reduces its variance further to a constant $20 each period.

    convexity costs for a given amount of liquidity. Consider if the range had a range
    spanning the price movement in this example, a +/- 10% price movement. The total
    LP cost would be reduced by 90%, a substantial savings. One's hedge size is also
    reduced, reducing capital requirements further.

    whether the range is restricted. In the lattice below, the restricted range starts
    with token A amount of only 7.39 vs. 77.7 in the unrestricted case, so the hedge
    is only -7.39 vs. -77.7\. However, in the final state, the net LP pnls are identical.

  zh: 在相同流动性下，无论范围是否受限，LP的预期凸性成本是相同的。在下图中，受限范围从仅7.39的代币A数量开始，而在无限制情况下为77.7，因此对冲仅为-7.39，相比之下为-77.7。然而，在最终状态下，净LP利润是相同的。

- en: Convexity costs are purely a function of gamma times the variance, and LP gamma
    is a linear function of liquidity. It's prudent to hedge this, but also important
    to realize the limits to what hedging can do. It cannot eliminate a convexity
    cost.

  zh: 凸性成本纯粹是伽马乘以方差的函数，而LP伽马是流动性的线性函数。对冲这一风险是审慎的，但同样重要的是要认识到对冲的局限性。它无法消除凸性成本。
