    a winter of discontent marked by massive write-offs on Wall Street and a wilting
    economy on Main, America''s portfolio managers have declared that the worst is
    over. More than half of the institutional investors participating in our latest
    Big Money poll say they''re bullish or very bullish about the prospects for stocks
    through the end of 2008\. Their forecasts suggest they''re even more upbeat about
    the first half of 2009.”'

    to buy every 20% dip and ignore fears.  However, as usual, the market trains you
    over rolling 5-20 year periods to make the wrong decision.  Closing your eyes
    and buying in 2008 was clearly the wrong decision, and I’m uncertain if closing
    your eyes and buying in 2009 was the right decision.  Closing your eyes and buying/holding
    anything now without regard to how we got here is very precarious.  It will be
    very interesting to see the results of this spring’s Barrons Big Money Poll.

    I could be as wrong as the money managers in Barrons April 2008.  You are responsible
    for your own investment gains and losses.**'
