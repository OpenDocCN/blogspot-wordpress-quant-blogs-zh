    that much of the disagreement is about the role of government in society. In general,
    the Right would prefer a less intrusive government and the Left would prefer a
    more interventionist government.

    the latest about-face by the IMF giving advice to governments to re-focus their
    policies away from austerity to growth.

- en: The main finding, based on data for 28 economies, is that the multipliers used
    in generating growth forecasts have been systematically too low since the start
    of the Great Recession, by 0.4 to 1.2, depending on the forecast source and the
    specifics of the estimation approach. Informal evidence suggests that the multipliers
    implicitly used to generate these forecasts are about 0.5\. So actual multipliers
    may be higher, in the range of 0.9 to 1.7.

    explain, the multiplier effect is the effect an action, such as government spending
    has on the economy. If the forecast multiplier effect is 0.5, then $1 of spending
    has a $0.50 effect on output, or GDP, i.e. the other $0.50 is "wasted" and therefore
    inefficient. If it''s 1.2, then spending $1 has a $1.20 on GDP and sparks more
    economic activity.'

    academic question about the proper estimator of the multiplier effect, which is
    a macro-economic question, but the difference between a macro-oriented solution
    and a micro oriented solution of getting the environment right to set the stage
    for sustainable growth.
