- en: The high-frequency trading world is always full of surprises, especially when
    roaming in some landscapes where small or tall towers are invaded by the dishes
    of HF traders who send signals above our heads. When I discovered (and tweeted
    about, on January 4th)  the 324-meter mast Vigilant  seeks to build in Richborough,
    I didn’t know that, three weeks ago, some local residents had taken charge of the
    project by digging a little the HFT world. Given the recents news coming from
    Ash, I decided that “[HFT in the Banana Land](https://sniperinmahwah.wordpress.com/2016/01/26/hft-in-the-banana-land/)”
    will of a spin-off of “HFT in my backyard”. After all, such a giant mast deserves
    well a longer story. So, here is “HFT in the Banana Land, Part 2”.

    not be appropriated to cross the Channel – I think these old masts could be used

    area, no more.

    dedicated to the “Richborough Communication Mast”, that “*Cascade Communications
    Ltd, media representative of client Vigilant Global, will give an overview of
    the mast proposal to parish Councillors between 6.45pm – 7.30pm, at the Library,
    Ash Village Hall on Monday 2nd November. It is understood a Vigilant Global representative
    will be present. Providing a Q & A opportunity is a primary focus of the session.
    The public is welcome to attend*”. It seems that at the two publics meetings of
    September, the discussions were about the benefits of the mast and “*a little
    about what Vigilant was going to do with the mast*”, according to residents, so
    some of them wanted to know more about Vigilant Global activities.

    with Vigilant Global was filmed, but don’t ask how I got it. One of my main frustrations
    in my investigation on the HFT microwave networks is that I missed this (in)famous
    auction in Houtem when, in December 2013, big HFT players from Chicago and big
    law firms from Belgium fought for hours to buy the Houtem tower (the starting
    price asked by the Belgian State was only €255,000, but hours later the winner,
    Jump Trading, was happy to pay $5,000,000). I really would have been in this small
    office, where the auction took place, lost in the Flemish country side. But now
    I have a video where I can see how one of the biggest HFT firms in the world,
    DRW, through their subsidiary Vigilant Global, are trying to deal with some council
    members and  residents. The film-maker asked me not to share it online, but as the
    meeting was public I am authorized to describe it and, above all, to give transcription
    of some Q&A – and some are stunning. The meeting took place in the small Ash Library
    where every Parish council meeting takes place (a 4 by 6 meters room), and the
    mast was the first subject of the meeting this day.

    Mr. PR) and, on his left, a representative of Vigilant (here Mr. Vigilant). Have
    in mind this video was taken three months ago, on November 2nd, 2015, that is
    two months before I heard about the Vigilant mast in Richborough, and two months
    and a half before I wrote the first part of “HFT in the Banana Land”. [My comments
    are in brackets.] First, Mr. PR repeated again the information provided on the [Richboroughmast.co.uk](http://Richboroughmast.co.uk): the
    history of the power station, the Nemo Link I talked about in [Part I](http://HFT%20in%20the%20Banana%20Land),
    the “Banana Land” (laughs), the point-to-point communication between UK and continental
    Europe, the benefits for the Dover Community Radio, etc. From 06:44, the construction is
    detailed (the mast, the solar panels, etc.). From 09:18, it’s all about the equipment (the
    guys, etc). From 10:00 Mr. PR and Mr. Vigilant explained why they need such a
    giant mast.

    probably 3 or 4% of Vigilant activities… as we also have a real estate business and…*”

    of Vigilant Global activites, two months before I heard about the mast from the
    first time (and I’m pretty sure the guy who sent me the link to the Richborough website
    is the same resident). That’s the proof information published by a blogger may
    help the community; information really matters – after all, if Vigilant wants
    to build this mast, it’s all about getting information before competitors do.
    This is probably because of “HFT in my backyard” that another resident, from Basildon,
    posted this public comment on the planning application [webpage](https://planning.dover.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=neighbourComments&keyVal=DCAPR_228292),
