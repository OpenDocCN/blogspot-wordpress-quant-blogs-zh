- en: The high-frequency trading world is always full of surprises, especially when
    roaming in some landscapes where small or tall towers are invaded by the dishes
    of HF traders who send signals above our heads. When I discovered (and tweeted
    about, on January 4th)  the 324-meter mast Vigilant  seeks to build in Richborough,
    I didn’t know that, three weeks ago, some local residents had taken charge of the
    project by digging a little the HFT world. Given the recents news coming from
    Ash, I decided that “[HFT in the Banana Land](https://sniperinmahwah.wordpress.com/2016/01/26/hft-in-the-banana-land/)”
    will of a spin-off of “HFT in my backyard”. After all, such a giant mast deserves
    well a longer story. So, here is “HFT in the Banana Land, Part 2”.

    not be appropriated to cross the Channel – I think these old masts could be used
    for a very local radio station available to the migratory birds living in the
    area, no more.

    with Vigilant Global was filmed, but don’t ask how I got it. One of my main frustrations
    in my investigation on the HFT microwave networks is that I missed this (in)famous
    auction in Houtem when, in December 2013, big HFT players from Chicago and big
    law firms from Belgium fought for hours to buy the Houtem tower (the starting
    price asked by the Belgian State was only €255,000, but hours later the winner,
    Jump Trading, was happy to pay $5,000,000). I really would have been in this small
    office, where the auction took place, lost in the Flemish country side. But now
    I have a video where I can see how one of the biggest HFT firms in the world,
    DRW, through their subsidiary Vigilant Global, are trying to deal with some council
    members and  residents. The film-maker asked me not to share it online, but as the
    meeting was public I am authorized to describe it and, above all, to give transcription
    of some Q&A – and some are stunning. The meeting took place in the small Ash Library
    where every Parish council meeting takes place (a 4 by 6 meters room), and the
    mast was the first subject of the meeting this day.

    Trading愿意支付$5,000,000）。我当时真的希望自己能够在拍卖会上，就在佛兰芒的乡下，但现在我有了一段视频，我可以看到世界上最大的HFT公司之一DRW，通过他们的子公司Vigilant
    Global，正试图与一些议会成员和居民进行交易。拍摄者要求我不要在网上分享这段视频，但由于会议是公开的，我有权描述，并且，最重要的是给出一些问答的文字记录——而且有些答案难以置信。这次会议是在艾许图书馆的小房间里举行的，那里是每次议员会议的举办地（一个4乘6米的房间），而天线是当天会议的第一个议题。

    The Ash council members were there, along with some residents and, in front of
    them (and in front of the camera) one people from Cascade Communications (here
    Mr. PR) and, on his left, a representative of Vigilant (here Mr. Vigilant). Have
    in mind this video was taken three months ago, on November 2nd, 2015, that is
    two months before I heard about the Vigilant mast in Richborough, and two months
    and a half before I wrote the first part of “HFT in the Banana Land”. [My comments
    are in brackets.] First, Mr. PR repeated again the information provided on the [Richboroughmast.co.uk](http://Richboroughmast.co.uk): the
    history of the power station, the Nemo Link I talked about in [Part I](http://HFT%20in%20the%20Banana%20Land),
    the “Banana Land” (laughs), the point-to-point communication between UK and continental
    Europe, the benefits for the Dover Community Radio, etc. From 06:44, the construction is
    detailed (the mast, the solar panels, etc.). From 09:18, it’s all about the equipment (the
    guys, etc). From 10:00 Mr. PR and Mr. Vigilant explained why they need such a

    help the community; information really matters – after all, if Vigilant wants
    to build this mast, it’s all about getting information before competitors do.

    Anyway, I’m really wondering how is that possible a firm could be so good in designing
    microwave networks but so bad in public relation. I’ll devote Part 4 to some of
    the technical questions (asked during the meeting) regarding regulation of microwaves
    (it seems some residents have issues with safety). In the meantime, a last fun
    fact: on the other side of the Channel, one of my Twitter followers wrote me:
    “*We own a flat on the last floor of the Ostduinkerk tower”.* What a coincidence!
    “*Now let’s figure out a way to cash in.*” Lol. He’ll probably give me some news from
    his grand-mother, who lives there and has let people use the flat for a feasibility
    study… Last but not least, a new council meeting will take place in Ash today, at
    6:30 pm. Council members will decide when they’ll all meet to make a decision
    about the Vigilant mast (probably by the end of February). And that’s not impossible
    I could get a new video.'
