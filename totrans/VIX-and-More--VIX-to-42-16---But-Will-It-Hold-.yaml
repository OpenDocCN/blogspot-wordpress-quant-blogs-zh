    not making new lows, then we have extreme fear.

    spike above 45 today, though I do not expect that to happen.

- en: In terms of a potential bottom, the big fly in the ointment is the calendar.
    Tomorrow is options expiration, which is followed by a weekend in which I can't
    imagine many investors will be comfortable with large long positions. As a result,
    if the markets do not show some strength in the second half of today's session,
    they are not likely to be strong tomorrow or Monday morning.
