    has been one of the most closely followed topics on *VIX and More*, ever since
    the [day the two VIX ETNs were launched](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/01/first-day-of-trading-in-vxx-and-vxz.html),
    in January 2009\. In the intervening 16 months, VXX has gone from an obscure niche
    product to a favorite of day traders, with volumes in excess of 20 million in
    each of the last 18 sessions. As a result, it is with great excitement that I
    note the CBOE has begun to offer options on VXX and VXZ today. (hat tip, [Adam
    Warner](http://dailyoptionsreport.com/blog/post/hey-you-can-trade-options-on-vxx-now/#When:13:45:03Z))

    its sibling, the iPath S&P 500 VIX Mid-Term Futures (5 month) ETN ([VXZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXZ))
    at considerable length in this space in the past and will not dive into that subjects
    again today. For those who are interested in exploring these issues in greater
    detail, the links below are a good place to start, as are the tags and hyperlinks
    for items such as [VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX), [term

    will open up a whole new world of volatility trading opportunities, whether considered
    separately or in conjunction with [VIX options](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20options)
    and other volatility products. I will definitely devote a good deal of time to
    this subject going forward.
