# Application Timing: GPS Vulnerabilities | Tales from a Trading Desk

## Application Timing: GPS Vulnerabilities

I see [Symmetricom](http://www.symmetricom.com/) is running a webinar on “Mitigating GPS Vulnerabilities in Network Timing Applications” which maybe worth a [watch](http://www.symmetricom.com/company/news-and-events/webinars/).  I’m guessing they will cover:

*   GPS Jammers – Illegal devices
*   Solar Flare Activity – Geomagnetic storms
*   Unintentional Interference – stuff breaks
*   GPS Antennas and Cables – remoteness of installations
