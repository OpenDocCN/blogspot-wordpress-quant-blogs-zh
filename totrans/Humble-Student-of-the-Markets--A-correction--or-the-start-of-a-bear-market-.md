# Humble Student of the Markets: A correction, or the start of a bear market?

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2018/10/a-correction-or-start-of-bear-market.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2018/10/a-correction-or-start-of-bear-market.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models**

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post,

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The

**Trend Model**

is an asset allocation model which applies trend following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or contraction (bearish)?"

My inner trader uses the trading component of the Trend Model to look for changes in the direction of the main Trend Model signal. A bullish Trend Model signal that gets less bullish is a trading "sell" signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading "buy" signal. The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. The turnover rate of the trading model is high, and it has varied between 150% to 200% per month.

. The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that began in March 2016 is shown below.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Buy equities*
*   Trend Model signal: Neutral*
*   Trading model: Bearish*

**Where's the bottom?**

When the market selloff began last Wednesday,

[Callum Thomas](https://twitter.com/Callum_Thomas/status/1050224007021191168)

conducted an (unscientific) Twitter poll asking if this is a correction, the start of a bear market, or just market noise. The overwhelming response favored a correction, which is contrarian bearish from a sentiment viewpoint.

Regular readers know that I have become increasingly cautious on the outlook for US equities since August (see

[10 or more technical reasons to be cautious on stocks](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2018/08/26/10-or-more-technical-reasons-to-be-cautious-on-stocks/)

and

[Red sky in the morning](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2018/09/09/red-sky-in-the-morning/)

). Now that the major US averages have begun to show signs of technical breakdowns, it is time to ask, "Is this just a correction, or the start of a bear market?"
