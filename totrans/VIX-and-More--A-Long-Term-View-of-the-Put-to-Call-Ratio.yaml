    think my favorite is Rob Hanna’s [Quantifiable Edges](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/).  The
    title pretty much sums up the blog’s approach.  This is a place where Rob analyzes
    the markets, observes various relationships that lie hidden under the surface
    for most investors, extracts some insight, and back tests these ideas to determine
    their historical profit potential.

    to have depleted his overnight R&D staff.  Instead, in [Why You Need to Normalize
    the Put to Call Ratio](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2008/06/why-you-need-to-normalize-putcall-ratio.html),
    Rob posts a graphic that looks a lot like the night sky (the bottom section of
    the first graphic, below), but actually comprises 12 years of the [CBOE Total
    Put to Call ratio](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/%24CPC).

- en: '*“Often times I hear traders refer to absolute levels in put/call ratios as
    if they are significant. What you can see by looking at the chart above is that
    ‘significant’ has change over time. From ’97 to ’02 a ‘spike’ in the ratio over
    1.00 could have been viewed as significant. A trader seeing such a reading may
    conclude that fear among option traders was running high. Now a reading of 1.00
    is below average. A reading of 0.5 would sure be significant, though. In 2000
    it was about average. Strategies that may have been developed 7 or 8 years ago
    that looked for a move to a certain number are now likely obsolete. That doesn’t
    mean the put/call ratio has stopped working as an indicator, though.'

    and institutions has changed over time. It will continue to change. To adjust
    for this you should normalize the readings over a certain time period and then
    compare the current readings to ‘normal’.”*

- en: Just for fun, I have appended a StockCharts.com graph of the SPX to the top
    of Rob’s TradeStation chart of the put to call ratio.  It may resemble a visual
    Minotaur of sorts, but the result shows an almost perfect negative correlation
    between the put to call ratio and the SPX from the mid-1990s through the end of
    2003.  Then, without warning, the correlation shifts from a negative one to a
    positive one from 2004 to 2008, before reverting to the traditional negative correlation
    pattern for the last six months or so.

- en: In the graphic at the bottom, I have done my best to fit a weekly chart of the
    total put to call ratio into an absolute scale that provides meaningful buy and
    sell signals.  There are a number of ways to look at this chart.  The first thing
    to do is to acknowledge that there is no place in the chart where meaningful buy
    and sell signals were generated in the same general time frame.  A second possible
    takeaway is that on those occasions when the P/C levels were below the red sell
    line or above the green buy line for an extended period of time, this could have
    been a signal (and an helpful one, in retrospect) to be short from 1999-2001 and
    long from 2005-2008.  Finally, while not spelled out on the chart, one can see
    how tracking the deviation between the 6 week EMA shown with a dotted blue line
    and a long-term (i.e., 40-50 week) moving average (not shown) could provide an
    actionable synthesis of the need to measure absolute and relative levels of the
    put to call ratio.
