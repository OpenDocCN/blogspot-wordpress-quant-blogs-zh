    to signal a changing of the guard in investor sentiment finally got something
    to sink their teeth into last week. On the other hand, investors who have been
    watching [China](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/China) closely have
    seen a slowly deteriorating picture since about mid-November.

    FTSE/Xinhua China 25 Index](http://www.ishares.com/product_info/fund/overview/FXI.htm),
    is now down 15.8% from its November high water mark and after declining sharply
    on large volume for the past two weeks is now below its 40 week (200 day) moving
    average.

    shows, FXI has been locked in a largely sideways pattern since last July after
    retracing approximately 54% of the fall from an October 2007 high of 69.92 and
    a subsequent low of 18.95 in October 2008.

    as support. Last week’s breach of the 40 week support line looks more serious
    than anything experienced during 2005-2007\. Should FXI not be able to close this
    week above the 40 week moving average, I would not be surprised to see that level
    flip from support to resistance and further confirm that Chinese stocks are in
    a bear market.
