    However, successful investors and traders look at the other side of the coin to
    see what could go wrong with their thesis. Today, I write about the bear case,
    or what's keeping me up at night.

- en: James Carville, former advisor to Bill Clinton, famously said that he wanted
    to be reincarnated as the bond market so that he could intimidate everyone. The
    message from the bond market is potentially worrying. In particular, emerging
    market bonds are selling off big time. The chart below of the emerging market
    bond ETF (EMB) against the 7-10 year Treasury ETF tells the story. The EMB/IEF
    ratio broke an important relative support level, with little signs of any further
    support below the break.

    much like how the crisis in Thailand led to the Asian Crisis. For now, the concerns
    are somewhat "contained". Yes, junk bond yileds have spiked...

    7-10 year Treasuries remain in a relative uptrend, which indicates that the trouble
    remains isolated in emerging markets.

    They have been in a multi-year trading range. Should this ratio break to the downside,
    it would be an indication that something is seriously wrong in EM that smart investors
    would be well advised to sit up and take notice of.

    Yardeni showed that the Street's forward 52-week revenue estimates are now ticking
    down. Unless margins were to expand, which is unlikely, earning estimates will
    follow a downward path and provide a headwind for equity prices.

    if any of these risks turn out to be more serious. My base case, for now, is that
    the market is undergoing a typical rolling correction, with leadership shifting
    from interest sensitive issues to deep cyclicals (see my recent post
