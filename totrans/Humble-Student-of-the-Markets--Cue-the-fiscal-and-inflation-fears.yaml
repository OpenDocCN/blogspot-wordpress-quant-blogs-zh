    He wants even more spending. Even though his policies have spiked the annual budget
    deficit to a new normal of a $1 trillion (with $2 trillion definitely within view)
    and interest rates are now starting to go up in large part because of his out-of-sync-with-the-economy
    stimulative fiscal policy, Trump is demanding that federal spending and the government’s
    red ink be increased even further.'

    of political trouble with congressional Republicans) doesn’t come close to offsetting
    the new spending Trump said he wants. It also won’t come close to being an offset
    even if the first package is followed with that second rescission plan Trump has
    said is coming, but which so far seems to be totally imaginary.

    proper path of fiscal policy is above our pay grade. Instead, my focus is on positioning
    portfolios for any changes in government policy.
