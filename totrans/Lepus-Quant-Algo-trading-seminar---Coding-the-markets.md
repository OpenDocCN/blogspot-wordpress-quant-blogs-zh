## Lepus Quant Algo trading seminar

### November 22, 2007

I’ll be at [this seminar](http://www.lepus.co.uk/Events.htm) this afternoon… see you there!

Update: it was a surprisingly good event, with some very insightful talks. Michael Simmonds was good: [slides here](http://www-cfr.jbs.cam.ac.uk/seminar/SimmondsPresentation.pdf). Also good were John Evans and Miles Kumaresan. And the wine tasting afterwards was quite pleasant too…
