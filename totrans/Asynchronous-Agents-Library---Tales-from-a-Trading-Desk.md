## Asynchronous Agents Library

Today whilst commuting into London I scanned over MSDN Magazine with my iPad and realized that I had possible missed the Asynchronous Agents [Library](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd492627.aspx). Actor/Agents solutions are definitely gathering momentum, but its clear from the [AAL](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/magazine/ff959205.aspx) that Microsoft is still missing the distributed angle.
