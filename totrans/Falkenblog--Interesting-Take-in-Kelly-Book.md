[Street Fighters](http://www.amazon.com/Street-Fighters-Hours-Stearns-Toughest/dp/1591842735/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1243130870&sr=1-1)

(p. 169):

> [Warren] Buffet almost had to chuckle. It was sort of like having a woman standing in front of you who had taken half her clothes off and then asked whether she should continue, he thought. Just as he'd want the woman to finish the job, he was certainly curious to hear what was happening that weekend with the embattled Bear.

I read this and thought, what does a woman know about how a man feels when in the presence of a naked willing woman? In one sense it is obvious, in another, complicated. As female and male parts are complementary, their desires are probably similar at one level, opposite in another. If women wanted

exactly

what a male wanted, she would not want a male. But then, I though if she framed the hypothetical as what a woman feels in the presence of a naked man to generate implications, this would generate questions about her personal preferences she would rather avoid.
