- en: The VIX has moved from overbought to oversold quite quickly this past week (based
    on its stretch above and below the 10-day average). This brings up the question
    of whether the now “oversold” VIX is suggesting a selloff for the S&P. I took
    a look at similar past situations.

- en: Results have been inconsistent but risk/reward has generally favored more upside
    over the coming weeks. This would seem to make sense since what you’re typically
    looking at in the SPX with the above setup is a strong rebound from a sharp decline
    during a long-term uptrend.

    one of those signs.
