    that indicate the market is in the process of forming a bottom. These signs, however,
    are medium term indicators and will not prevent the market from going lower from
    current levels.

    aggressive lending practices – we all know the story. The chart below shows the
    relative returns of the homebuilders against the S&P 500\. An interesting thing
    happened in this latest downleg as the relative support levels seems to have held.
    The homebuilders are no longer leading the market down. This could be an early
    sign that the worst of the carnage may be over.

    in the banking sector. A look at the relative chart of the KBW Bank Index (BKX)
    shows that the banks are outperforming the S&P 500 in this latest downleg. This
    is another positive divergence and indication that the market is trying to base
    and make a bottom at these levels.

    The financial services sector, not just the more narrowly defined banking group,
    continues to underperform the market.

- en: The chart below shows the relative returns of the XLF to the S&P 500 and the
    XLF has broken down to new relative lows. The difference between the XLF and the
    BKX can be traced to the greater weights of the (former) investment banks and
    brokers in the XLF, which are dragging down returns. I interpret this as Mr. Market’s
    worries have shifted from the banking to derivatives and the worst of the storm
    may be over for pure banking, which represents some partial relief for the macro
    outlook.
