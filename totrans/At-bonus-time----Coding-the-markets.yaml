- en: Read [“At Bonus Time, No-one Can Hear You Scream”](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Bonus-Time-No-one-Hear-Scream/dp/1904027318)
    at the weekend. It’s a first person fictional narrative about an investment banker
    in the weeks leading up to comp day. And it’s a nasty little book. The few good
    guys get turned over, and so do many of the devious, amoral slime merchants too.
    It may be an accurate picture of the worst aspects of trading floor culture, but
    it’s neither amusing nor edifying.
