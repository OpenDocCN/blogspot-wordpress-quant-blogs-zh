- en: by Respected Dead Economist Paul Samuelson that markets are macro inefficient
    and micro efficient. Samuelson noted one can arbitrage relative prices via derivatives,
    long/short portfolios, but if the aggregate market is too high or low, it's basically
    unarbitragable.  Big bubbles like the housing and internet bubble lasted for longer
    than anyone anticipated, and those who saw this all coming in early on would surely
    have lost their capital by the time the end-game rolled around, even though trends
    were pretty much in place years prior. Fair enough.

- en: and Frazzini and Pedersen (2010), they have managers reaching for beta to outperform
    in absolute their benchmark, because they think that higher beta stocks have higher
    returns.  But then they state that micro selection against the benchark lowers
    risk because some investors like the alpha in low volatility stocks.  This 'micro'
    story explains the low vol anomaly  though this sounds more like micro inefficiency
    to me, as these guys are not just irrational, but bipolar. Meanwhile, as countries/industries
    aren't good to allocate between, one is stuck in these bad sectors and 1) receive
    no premium and 2) can't move because of conventions. Methinks they are gilding
    the product differentiation lily here.

  zh: Frazzini 和 Pedersen (2010) 提到，他们让管理者寻求 beta 值，以绝对超过他们的基准，因为他们认为更高 beta 值的股票有更高的回报率。但是，他们又指出，微观选择相对于基准的策略降低了风险，因为一些投资者喜欢低波动股票的
    alpha。这个“微观”故事解释了低波动异常，尽管这对我来说更像是微观无效，因为这些人不仅仅是非理性的，而且是双极性的。与此同时，由于国家/行业之间的分配并不理想，人们陷入了这些不良行业，既没有获得溢价，也无法转移，因为受到惯例的限制。我认为他们在这里是在把产品差异化涂金。
- en: 'They conclude noting that one should use both industry/country risk and idiosyncratic
    beta risk to allocate capital, and I agree. I would state it simpler: rank everything
    by Total Volatility over the past 9 months using daily returns, and don''t invest
    in anything in the top half.  That would include country risk, industry risk,
    beta risk, and idiosyncratic volatility. If you are a Sharpe ratio maximizing
    investor, you would be better served simply minimizing the volatility subject
    to a long-only constraint, but if you are benchmarking, by eliminating the above-average
    volatility equities you have something with a more moderate beta but without the
    high-vol detritus that brings down returns and increases portfolio volatility.'

  zh: 他们总结指出，应该同时使用行业/国家风险和特异性 beta 风险来分配资本，我同意。我会更简单地陈述：使用过去 9 个月的总波动率对所有事物进行排名，使用每日回报率，不要投资排名前一半的任何事物。这将包括国家风险、行业风险、
    beta 风险和特异波动率。如果你是一个最大化夏普比率的投资者，你最好只是在长期投资约束条件下最小化波动率，但如果你正在进行基准测试，通过消除高于平均波动率的股票，你将得到一个具有更适度
    beta 的东西，而没有降低回报并增加投资组合波动率的高波动率碎片。
- en: While the basic low vol strategy is a commodity, one can easily add 200 basis
    points of value by relaxing the constraints of size/currency across the globe,
    but this only works because many investors are constrained in their size/currency
    equity allocations (eg, large-cap Europe, small cap UK), and this is easy techinically
    but difficult politically.  One may also add 100 basis points of value via using
    the right 'risk' metric when choosing low vol, as it's really a 'low risk' story,
    though this is dangerous and investors should be wary because most people who
    try this unconsciously overfit the problem and make it worse.

  zh: 虽然基本的低波动策略是一种商品，但人们可以通过在全球放宽大小/货币的约束来轻松增加 200 个基点的价值，但这只有在许多投资者在其大小/货币股票配置上受到约束的情况下才有效（例如，欧洲大型市值，英国小型市值），而这在技术上很容易但在政治上很困难。当选择低波动时，人们还可以通过使用正确的“风险”指标增加
    100 个基点的价值，因为这实际上是一个“低风险”故事，尽管这是危险的，投资者应该谨慎，因为大多数试图这样做的人会无意识地过度拟合问题并使情况变得更糟。
