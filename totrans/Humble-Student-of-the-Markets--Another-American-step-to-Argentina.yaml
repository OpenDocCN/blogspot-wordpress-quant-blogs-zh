    wave of globalization at the turn of the 20th century. Both were young, dynamic
    nations with fertile farmlands and confident exporters.

    quite similar hands but played them very differently.***

    for anyone but the elite became more and more restricted in Argentina and the
    economy eventually stagnated. America, by contrast, embraced the ideal of a Land
    of Opportunity and flourished.

    to ­recreate it in the New World. The similarities were more than superficial.
    In the 1860s and 1870s, the landowners regarded rural life and the actual practice
    of agriculture with disdain. Many lived refined, deracinated lives in the cities,
    spending their time immersed in European literature and music. The closest they
    came to celebrating country life was elevating polo, an aristocratised version
    of a rural pursuit, to a symbol of Argentine athletic elegance. Even then it took
    an elite form: the famous Jockey Club of Buenos Aires. By the end of the 19th
    century some were sending their sons to Eton.'

    of smaller family holdings. Even when it did sell off large tracts of land, the
    potential for a powerful landowning class to emerge was limited. Squatters who
    seized family-sized patches of soil had their claims acknowledged. US cattle ranchers
    did not spend much time boning up on the entrance requirements of elite English
    schools. And as well as raising cattle, the western settlers grew wheat and corn…

    and has put us between a rock and a hard place with QE2\. It has kept the banking
    system liquid and helped goose stocks. But in that it has also provided juice
    for a commodity explosion that has hurt the world's poor, it has offset much,
    if not all, the good it did. In that real money (ex inflation) matters, the situation
    is not nearly as favorable as most Fed watchers believe."

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s no use pretending that what has obviously happened has not in fact happened.
    The upper 1 percent of Americans are now taking in nearly a quarter of the nation’s
    income every year. In terms of wealth rather than income, the top 1 percent control
    40 percent. Their lot in life has improved considerably. Twenty-five years ago,
    the corresponding figures were 12 percent and 33 percent. One response might be
    to celebrate the ingenuity and drive that brought good fortune to these people,
    and to contend that a rising tide lifts all boats. That response would be misguided.
    ***While the top 1 percent have seen their incomes rise 18 percent over the past
    decade, those in the middle have actually seen their incomes fall.*** For men
    with only high-school degrees, the decline has been precipitous—12 percent in
    the last quarter-century alone. ***All the growth in recent decades—and more—has
    gone to those at the top. In terms of income equality, America lags behind any
    country in the old, ossified Europe that President George W. Bush used to deride.
    Among our closest counterparts are Russia with its oligarchs and Iran.*** While
    many of the old centers of inequality in Latin America, such as Brazil, have been
    striving in recent years, rather successfully, to improve the plight of the poor
    and reduce gaps in income, America has allowed inequality to grow.

    Whenever we diminish equality of opportunity, it means that we are not using some
    of our most valuable assets—our people—in the most productive way possible. Second,
    many of the distortions that lead to inequality—such as those associated with
    monopoly power and preferential tax treatment for special interests—undermine
    the efficiency of the economy. This new inequality goes on to create new distortions,
    undermining efficiency even further. To give just one example, far too many of
    our most talented young people, seeing the astronomical rewards, have gone into
    finance rather than into fields that would lead to a more productive and healthy
    economy.'
