- en: What should traders make of the pre-Christmas panic today? S&P 500 futures were
    down as much as -2.5% overnight. The market opened up down about -1.5%, but recovered
    most of its losses to a -0.4% retreat today. More importantly, the bulls were
    able to hold support at 3650.

- en: The VIX Index surged above its upper Bollinger Band, which is a sign of an oversold
    market. In the past year, most of the similar instances saw the market either
    rise or stabilize after VIX upper BB readings (blue vertical lines). The only
    exception occurred in February, when the market cratered as the news of the pandemic
    spooked risk appetite (red line). On the other hand, the 5-day RSI (top panel)
    is nowhere near an oversold condition.
