    volatility, this will be the last mid-week market update until the new year. I
    plan on taking a few days off at the end of the year. I plan to publish the usual
    two comments this weekend, follow by single comments each weekend after that.'

    market moves are often reversed on the next day. We can say that the bulls were
    disappointed by the market reaction to the soft CPI report. The S&P 500 rallied
    up to test the falling resistance trend line but failed. While the bulls fell
    short of pushing the index about resistance at 4100, the bears were also unable
    to push the market below support at 3900\. Tactically, all that's left is to wait
    for the Santa Claus rally.

    conducive to tax-loss selling. When the tax-loss sales abate, it becomes a setup
    for the Santa Claus rally, which begins the day after Christmas and ends the second
    day of the new year.
