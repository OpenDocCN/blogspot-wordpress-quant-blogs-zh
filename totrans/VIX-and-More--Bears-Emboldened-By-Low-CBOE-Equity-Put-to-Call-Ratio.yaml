    have no idea if they are emboldened by the low CBOE equity put to call ratio ([CPCE](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/CPCE)),
    but they should be.

- en: My preferred way of looking at the equity put to call ratio involves using an
    exponential 10 day moving average (EMA) as a smoothing factor. The 10 day EMA
    generates the dotted blue line in the chart below, which is now at a one month
    low, meaning that bullish investors are now likely to be speculating more aggressively
    with calls and are less concerned about managing risk with put protection. The
    chart shows that prior lows in August, September, October and January all preceded
    meaningful pullbacks. The history of [put to call](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/put%20to%20call)
    extremes suggests that another pullback is now in the offing.

    this looks like an excellent time for longs to take some profits and go enjoy
    the vernal equinox.
