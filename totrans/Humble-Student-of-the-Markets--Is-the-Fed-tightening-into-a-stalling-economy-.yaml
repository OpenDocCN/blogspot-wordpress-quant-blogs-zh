    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading
    "buy" signal. The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of
    the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. Past trading of
    the trading model has shown turnover rates of about 200% per month.

    than not that stock prices rise, even if the Fed tightens monetary policy. Many
    analysts, however, continue to resist this historical lesson, largely on the basis
    of traditional valuation metrics. These metrics, such as PE ratios, have been
    long elevated, leading to the difficulty explaining market behavior that my Bloomberg
    View colleague Barry Ritholtz has observed.

    is that they should be watching for signs that, at a minimum, earnings growth
    will falter or, probably more importantly, that the economy is set to tip into
    recession. I tend to think it is more likely that the economy takes the equity
    market down with it than the opposite.

    in Washington, for example, could erupt into a crisis than threatens the economy.
    A more likely scenario is that the time will come -- as it always has -- when
    the Fed tightens policy too much and reverses itself too slowly. That is the most
    likely event that brings down the economy and equity markets. We just aren’t near
    that point yet.

    to stall. These indications, if viewed from a standalone basis, are not cause
    for concern. But combined with the Fed`s resolve to normalize monetary policy,
    current conditions could become the basis for a monetary policy error that tips
    the economy into recession.
