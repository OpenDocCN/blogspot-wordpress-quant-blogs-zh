    that a company provides to the IT staff and the perceived quality of the company.

- en: Barclays had the best coffee service. Being a British bank, it paid a lot of
    attention to the variety of teas it made available. It also had one of those big
    machines that made cappucino, expresso, or hot chocolate. I was at that machine
    five times a day.

- en: My current company has free Martinson's coffee, but charges 50 or 75 cents for
    Flavia. After years of drinking Starbucks, Martinson's seems very bitter and flavorless.
    I guess that I am too used to Starbucks.
