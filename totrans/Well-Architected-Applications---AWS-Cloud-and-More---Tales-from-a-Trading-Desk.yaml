    Framework” is clearly cloud focused, it has in my view a lot of relevant material
    for non-cloud applications.  AWS Well-Architected Framework is based on four pillars—security,
    reliability, performance efficiency, and cost optimization.  Clearly all four
    pillars are relevant to non-cloud applications, with cost optimization being high
    up due to budgets, hardware purchases, and data centre space.

    change” – something that all of us have probably experienced, testing in an environment
    which has a considerable delta to production.  Cloud offers “automate the creation
    of test environments that emulate your production configurations, you can carry
    out testing easily.”

    in light of the EU’s General Data Protection [Regulation](http://www.computerweekly.com/news/450281144/European-Parliament-set-to-approve-EU-data-protection-law).

     Unfortunately this test is all to often never attempted, leaving to chance the
    risk that when recovery is needed, its not going to work as expected 😦
