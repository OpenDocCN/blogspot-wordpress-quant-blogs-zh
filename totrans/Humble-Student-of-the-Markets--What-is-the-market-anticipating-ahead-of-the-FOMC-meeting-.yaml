- en: Ahead, of the upcoming FOMC, meeting, what is the market discounting? I conduct
    a factor and sector review for some answers. Starting with a multi-cap review
    of value and growth, value stocks have been outperforming growth stocks within
    large caps since early August, but this has not been confirmed by mid and small
    caps. The value and growth relationship has been mostly trendless since June.
