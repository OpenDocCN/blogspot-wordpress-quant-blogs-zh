# Quantifiable Edges: Poor Nasdaq Breadth A Bit Of A Downer

Below is one study that appeared in the Quantifinder last night. It suggests a bearish edge thanks primarily to the poor Nasdaq breadth on Thursday. I’ve updated the table from the 4/29/09 blog below.

I should note that while there appears to be a bit of a bearish edge, this study is faced with some conflicting bullish ones that I’ve discussed over the last few days in the Subscriber Letter. The outlook isn’t completely cut and dry. I did think the study was worth noting and updating though.
