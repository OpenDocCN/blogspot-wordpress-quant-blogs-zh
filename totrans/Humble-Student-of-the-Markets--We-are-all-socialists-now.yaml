    of that comment, Keynesian ideas had become largely discredited. Now, the world
    is turning Left after a long period of embracing free market ideas.

    do we begin to implement structural reforms in order to align the incentives?
    If taxpayers are forced to pay for the losses from bad trades, this socialization
    of risk adds to the moral hazard problem. This socialization of risk actually
    encourages more aggressive behavior in the future.'
