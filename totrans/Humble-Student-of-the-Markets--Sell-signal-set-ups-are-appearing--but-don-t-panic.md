# Humble Student of the Markets: Sell signal set-ups are appearing, but don't panic

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2023/12/sell-signal-set-ups-are-appearing-but.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2023/12/sell-signal-set-ups-are-appearing-but.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models** 

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post, 

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The 

**Trend Asset Allocation Model**

 is an asset allocation model that applies trend-following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity prices. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. The performance and full details of a model portfolio based on the out-of-sample signals of the Trend Model can be found

[here](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/trend-model-report-card/)

.

My inner trader uses a 

**trading model**

, which is a blend of price momentum (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa). Subscribers receive real-time alerts of model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of the email alerts is updated weekly 

[here](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/trading-track-record/)

. The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that began in March 2016 is shown below.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Buy equities (Last changed from “sell” on 28-Jul-2023)*
*   Trend Model signal: Bullish (Last changed from “neutral” on 28-Jul-2023)*
*   Trading model: Bullish (Last changed from “neutral” on 20-Nov-2023)*

** The performance chart and model readings have been delayed by a week out of respect to our paying subscribers.***Update schedule**

: I generally update model readings on my

 on weekends. I am also on X/Twitter at @humblestudent. Subscribers receive real-time alerts of trading model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of those email alerts is shown

#### Don’t overstay the party

Two weeks ago, I set out a number of bearish trigger warnings for investors (see

[How Far Can This Market Run?](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2023/11/19/how-far-can-this-rally-run-5/)

). Two signals have been triggered.

The NYSE McClellan Summation Index saw its weekly stochastic (bottom panel) edge into overbought territory. The NASDAQ McClellan Summation Index, which is not pictured, also reached a similar reading.

Don’t panic. These readings are only bearish set-ups and not immediate take-profit signals. Current conditions are consistent with a rally into year-end and possibly early January, but it is a warning not to overstay the party.
