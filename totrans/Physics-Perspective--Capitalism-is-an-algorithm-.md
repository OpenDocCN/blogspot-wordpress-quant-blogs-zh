I have an essay coming out in Bloomberg tonight which looks at

[the fascinating article](http://www.democracyjournal.org/31/capitalism-redefined.php?page=all)

I

[recently mentioned](http://physicsoffinance.blogspot.com/2014/03/capitalism-redefined.html)

by Nick Hanauer and Eric Beinhocker. I've also posted

[some further discussion](https://medium.com/the-physics-of-finance/2f606f111cf5)

over at Medium on one particular aspect of their article -- the notion that capitalism is best understood as an evolutionary process for finding solutions to human problems. It's messy, wasteful, chaotic, and that's precisely why it works -- by allowing a parallel exploration by many minds of the huge space of possible solutions to human problems. Capitalism is an algorithm in much the way evolution is an algorithm (or at least is LIKE an algorithm).
