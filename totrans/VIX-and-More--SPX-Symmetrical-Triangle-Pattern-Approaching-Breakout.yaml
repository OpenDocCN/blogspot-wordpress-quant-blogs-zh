- en: In the chart below, I show a [symmetrical triangle](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/symmetrical%20triangle)
    (dotted green line) that has formed in the S&P 500 index over the course of the
    past 2-3 months. As the triangle narrows, the potential for a breakout move –
    in either direction – increases substantially.

- en: Classical technical analysis categorizes symmetrical triangles as continuation
    patterns, which suggests that the most likely direction of the breakout move is
    down. With the SPX currently hugging the bottom of the pattern and needing to
    gain about 1.7 points each day just to stay above the line, treading water is
    not good enough. Instead, the markets will need a significant bounce to get some
    breathing room.

    low…
