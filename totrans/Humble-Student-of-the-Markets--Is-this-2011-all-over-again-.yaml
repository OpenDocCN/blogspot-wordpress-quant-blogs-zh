    has been concentrated in near-term budget changes, which, taken together, could
    create a significant headwind for the economic recovery. The CBO estimates that
    deficit-reduction policies in current law will slow the pace of real GDP growth
    by about 1-1/2 percentage points this year, relative to what it would have been
    otherwise. A significant portion of this effect is related to the ***automatic
    spending sequestration that is scheduled to begin on March 1, which, according
    to the CBO's estimates, will contribute about 0.6 percentage point to the fiscal
    drag on economic growth this year***. Given the still-moderate underlying pace
    of economic growth, this additional near-term burden on the recovery is significant.
    Moreover, besides having adverse effects on jobs and incomes, a slower recovery
    would lead to less actual deficit reduction in the short run for any given set
    of fiscal actions.

    keels over into recession. What's more, another debt ceiling debate with a drop-dead
    deadline of March 27 will pour gasoline on the fire and could lead to further
    market anxieties.

    Mario Draghi's "whatever it takes" remark in July 2012 and the ECB's subsequent
    OMT program contributed to further stabilization. Today, the market consensus
    has evolved to the view that the ECB has taken tail-risk, or the risk of a European
    sovereign debt or banking crisis, off the table. The ECB, it seemed, had built
    a financial castle wall around the eurozone again.

    the ECB's "conditionalities", namely austerity and structural reform programs.
    The rise of anti-euro forces in the recent Italian election shows how fragile
    the ECB's castle walls really are.

    This divergence is starting to raise the question of the viability of the French-German

    Union and brings up the question of wage and productivity differentials between
    the two countries. If the two economies can't converge and Germany is unwilling
    to subsidize France, the euro is cooked. Nothing else matters. It doesn't matter

    am not saying that the downside could be the same, it is nevertheless a warning

    is how the Fed acted then and now. In 2011, the Fed's QE program was just ending,
    while we are seeing QE-Infinity today. The actions of the Federal Reserve today
    may serve to cushion the effects of the speed bumps that the equity markets are
    likely to experience.
