    stage model](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/trader%20development%20stage%20model),
    I was quite surprised and heartened by the response.

    development model, I had in mind a novice trader that was focusing primarily on
    stocks, but perhaps occasionally trading ETFs. With respect to options, my sense
    is that for the most part, novice traders avoid options entirely or take an occasional
    gamble on a potential big winner by buying out of the money calls or puts.

- en: I suspect quite a few beginning traders get frustrated with some of the stage
    one issues associated with entries, leverage and position sizing and before coming
    to terms with these issues, they decide that stocks just aren’t the right trading
    vehicle for getting rich in a hurry. Attracted by the leverage potential of options,
    these traders make the jump from stocks to options and in so doing, simply magnify
    the cost of their mistakes. Of course, this is absolutely the worst way to approach
    options. Almost without exception, traders who follow this course of action succeed
    only in accelerating the time it takes to blow out their account.

- en: The situation is only marginally better for traders who make the jump to options
    after advancing to stage two and are grappling with how to cut losses while letting
    winners run. With options positions much more volatile than stocks and spreads
    much wider, many of the exit strategies that work well for stocks do not work
    as well with options. Further, some traders become confused about whether to use
    the options, the underlying or both as their cues for when to exit. On a personal
    level, while I think mastering the art of exiting positions is a critical success
    factor for anyone who trades stocks, I found that porting the lessons I learned
    about stock exit strategies to options was nowhere near as easy as I had hoped.

    options will be difficult to trade profitably, but these traders should understand
    most of the hurdles to success and what it takes to overcome them. Still, edges
    that work for stocks don’t necessarily work for options and

- en: The bottom line is that for those stage three stock traders who are interested
    in augmenting their trading with options, their time and effort will likely be
    rewarded. On the other hand, for those traders who are still mired in stage one
    and stage two of their development process, options are almost certain to be a
    disaster and result in large losses.

    an honest self-assessment before diving in and be sure to make risk management
    your number one priority.
