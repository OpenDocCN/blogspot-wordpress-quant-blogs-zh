    simply to demonstrate I am a real economist and to say this equation 11 is going
    to be the centerpiece of Lawrence H. Summers and J. Bradford DeLong’s Fiscal Policy
    in a Depressed Economy, which is going to be presented at the Brookings institutiton
    on Friday March 23, and then published in the Spring issue of the Brookings papers
    on Economic Activity.

- en: DeLong refers to, which contains 7 variables, a couple of which are straightforward
    (tax rate, the real growth rate), the rest could all be somewhere within the (-inf,inf)
    space that lets macro debates happen. Further, he's talking about rates of change,
    so there's an unspecified time dimension and these parameters are time-varying,
    having different short and long-term levels and the definition of 'long term'
    also probably varies over the business cycle.

    just that he, his credentials, Larry Summers and their initials, will be speaking
    at an Important Institution which will then publish research that contains as
    a centerpiece, an equation. In short, equation 11 is being used to prove his profundity
    in the most disingenuous way, because equations by themselves do not mean anything.
    That is, it's not like this equation has ever been empirically tested, let alone
    validated, and the history of economics is littered with empirically vacuous equations.
    Further, it's not like it is going into a refereed publication.

    or equations. Those people aren't worth impressing. While such signals are correlated
    with good ideas, they are neither necessary nor sufficient for a good idea. When
    someone emphasizes these signals, however, that should lower their credibility
    among thoughtful people because it suggests bad faith, a preference towards pretentious
    irrelevancies.

- en: I've seen this a lot, hiding behind equations. It often works because one does
    not want to sit down, understand what all the variables mean and how they are
    measured, etc. I just don't feel impressed at all by such equations because my
    Bayesian prior is they merely have a bad idea in equation form, so I don't give
    them the benefit of the doubt even when I'm lazy and have not enough time to evaluate
    their math.

  zh: 我经常看到这种情况，隐藏在方程式背后。它通常会奏效，因为你不想坐下来，理解所有变量的含义以及它们是如何测量的，等等。我对这样的方程式一点都不感到惊讶，因为我的贝叶斯先验认为它们只是以方程式形式表达的一个坏主意，所以即使我懒惰并且没有足够的时间来评估他们的数学，我也不会给他们好处。
