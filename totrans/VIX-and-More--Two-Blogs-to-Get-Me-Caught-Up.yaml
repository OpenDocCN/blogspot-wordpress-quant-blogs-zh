- en: Some personal business has kept me away from the markets for the better part
    of a week and last night I found myself with the daunting task of getting caught
    up with what has been going on in the economy and in the markets.

    two blogs: [Abnormal Returns](http://abnormalreturns.com/) and [Cobra’s Market
    View](http://cobrasmarketview.blogspot.com/).'

- en: Admittedly, calling Abnormal Returns a single blog is stretching the definition
    a bit, as the folks at Abnormal read just about everything written on the markets
    and assemble a list of the best of the best on an almost daily basis. I have no
    idea how many articles are left on the cutting floor, but the ones that make the
    final links list always give me a lot of ideas to contemplate.

- en: Whereas Abnormal Returns covers the entire economic landscape and a wide variety
    of perspectives, Cobra’s Market View takes a focused and highly personal approach.
    Yong Pan’s focus is on technical analysis. He summarizes much of his thinking
    in his blog, doing so by drawing upon a wide variety of superbly crafted and annotated
    charts. Better yet, those yearning for more information behind his thinking can
    always check out the 89 (!) charts Yong Pan maintains in his [StockCharts public
    list](http://stockcharts.com/def/servlet/Favorites.CServlet?obj=ID2393449).

    for several days and need a quick update, I am amazed by how much ground I can
    cover just by reviewing the two blogs above.

    can always mosey on over to the [Daily Options Report](http://adamsoptions.blogspot.com/)...
