    market update early. The Shanghai Index moved into bear market territory by declining
    20% on a peak-to-trough basis overnight. The SPX is testing its 50 day moving
    average (dma). Europe is struggling as both the FTSE 100 and Euro STOXX 50 have
    violated near-term support levels.'

    alive. The SPX is undergoing a correction, but it remains in an uptrend within
    a range-bound consolidation that began in February.
