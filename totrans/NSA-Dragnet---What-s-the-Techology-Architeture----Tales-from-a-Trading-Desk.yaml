- en: Most of us have probably read something about Snowden and the NSA data collection. 
    ACLU’s recent [article](http://www.aclu.org/blog/national-security/guide-what-we-now-know-about-nsas-dragnet-searches-your-communications),
    “A Guide to What We Now Know About the NSA’s Dragnet Searches of Your Communications”,
    provides the usual high level view of the data collection, analysis and searching
    features that the NSA have at their disposal.  Like possible numerous other software
    engineers, I’m curious as to the architecture, and technology in use.  Specifically,
    the data storage, the amount of real-time compared to off-line processing, etc

    X-KEYSCORE “Where” slide, it sounds like the data is stored locally where its
    collected.

    content and meta data (IP address’s, email address, keywords etc.) and store the
    data for further processing, or just search retrieval

    as per the above two points.  Again its unclear if data storage for PRISM is local
    to each PRISM tap, or back to a single data repository

    from the open source community could aid the NSA in processing the data collected. 
    However, hadoop across multiple data centres located globally would incur some
    latency.

    NSA has the stated application and network taps, its effectively a [continuous](http://coherence.oracle.com/display/COH31UG/Continuous+Query)
    query against the NSA’s data source to get a real-time view for the data requested

    curious if anyone reading this blog has found further writing on the hypothetical
    technology being used by the NSA to process the “big-data” problem they would
    clearly have
