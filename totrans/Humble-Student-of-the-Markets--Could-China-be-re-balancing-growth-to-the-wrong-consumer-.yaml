    future. Prior to the current slowdown, the Chinese authorities had committed to
    restructuring their economy. Restructuring meant redirecting Chinese output from
    foreign to domestic markets, which implied a change in the product mix, given
    differences in Chinese and foreign spending patterns. Restructuring meant rebalancing
    domestic spending from investment to consumption. The investment rate would be
    lowered from a stratospheric 50 percent, given that no economy can productively
    invest such a large share of its national income for any length of time. There
    would be no more construction of ghost towns and no more bullet trains running
    off the rails, in other words. As wages rose, the share of consumption would be
    allowed to rise from 1/3 of GDP toward the 2/3 that is the international norm.
    Bank balance sheets would be strengthened by holding financial institutions to
    stricter reserve requirements and higher lending standards. The result was to
    be a better balanced, more stable, and less financially vulnerable Chinese economy.'

    companies in several sectors identified in BCG’s March report as nearing a “tipping
    point.” In these industry groups, China’s cost advantage is likely to shrink within
    the next few years to the point where companies should rethink where they produce
    certain goods, mainly those for sale in North America. These tipping-point sectors
    are transportation goods, appliances and electrical equipment, furniture, plastic
    and rubber products, machinery, fabricated metal products, and computers and electronics.
    BCG predicts that production of 10 to 30 percent of U.S. imports from China in
    these industries, which account for approximately 70 percent of goods that the
    U.S. imports from that nation, could shift to the U.S. before the end of the decade.

    makes the objective to re-balance growth away from infrastructure spending to
    the Chinese consumer far more urgent. In this way, the Chinese economy would be
    able to grow more sustainably by creating a new source of demand from their own
    domestic economy. Alas, it does not appear likely to happen as re-focusing growth
    away from infrastructure spending would seriously hurt Party insiders who have
    gotten obscenely rich in this boom, as I point out before (see

    American consumer as the reverse offshoring trend starts to take hold and accelerate.
