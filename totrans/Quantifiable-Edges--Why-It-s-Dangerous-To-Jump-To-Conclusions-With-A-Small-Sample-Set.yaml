    without solid evidence and a decent sized sample set.

    normally considered bullish. In fact, the evidence is unclear. Testing on the

    after a short pullback. Eight of nine instances closed lower at some point in
    the next 3 days by an average of ¾%. Looking out 10 days

    does not clearly suggest an edge either way. Someone accepting the low number
    of instances and only checking either the SPY or the NDX might be led to believe
    otherwise.
