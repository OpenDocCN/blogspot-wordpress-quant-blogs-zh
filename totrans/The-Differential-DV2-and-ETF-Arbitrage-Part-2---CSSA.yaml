    and 4) z-scores to name a few. In my opinion, the DV2 (a specific setting of the
    proprietary DVO which is a short-term ocscillator) and the DVI (intermediate oscillator)
    are vastly superior. This is not just an opinion it is borne out by internal research.'

    to each of the aforementioned alternatives are substantially higher with nearly
    identical standard deviation, lower drawdowns, less time in drawdowns, and smaller
    maximum losing trades. ***Note that the same results are found when comparing
    DV indicators on individual stocks or ETFs for swing trading.***

- en: The question is why? This was partially addressed in Part1 but the reality is
    that standard indicators each suffer from certain disadvantages. I would first
    point out that Bollinger Bands, and z-scores can be grouped together, and so can
    stochastics and the venerable RSI. Bollinger Bands and z-scores have one primary
    achilles heel—they rely on the assumption of a normal distribution. Without getting
    into a heavy discussion of the flaws in the assumption of normality in security
    returns, suffice to say extreme events are far more probable than what the bell
    curve or lognormal bell curve would indicate. Furthermore, the *actual* distribution
    can also cluster heavily around certain areas, and this is unique to every stock
    or ETF. As a consequence, both shallow levels such as above/below the mean or
    extreme levels can be misrepresented leading to poor signals. RSI and stochastics
    are relative indicators in the sense that a mathematical scale is used to determine
    readings relative to historical data (as in the case of RSI) and maximum and minimum
    values as in the case of stochastics. This presents a different set of problems
    as stochastics for example spend most of their time at extremes, while extreme
    RSI readings do not neccessarily imply that a certain overbought/oversold reading
    is actually rare or extreme based on the current environment (like the last week
    or so).

    data and scale for it in a meaningful way. It is intuitively obvious that intraday
    highs and lows represent meaningful support and resistance levels. Additionally
    extreme stretch is captured more accurately by examining the pattern of multi-day
    price behaviour. In the case of pairs, the very best opportunities occur intraday
    when volatility creates tremendous discrepancies. This volatility needs to captured
    adequately to understand when a pair is likely to revert to the mean.

- en: The DV indicators use the “empirical distribution” which is a fancy way of saying
    that they look at the actual historical data of the stock, pair, or ETF. Capturing
    all of the strange nuances that are unique to each. Furthermore, this distribution
    is adaptive because it constantly rolls forward updating the distribution with
    fresh data. Of course these indicators also utilitze intraday data, which makes
    them even more effective.

- en: Pair trading and arbitrage is a competitive game, involving small returns and
    fixed costs in the way of commissions. Any edge that can be extracted can mean
    the difference between survival and failure, especially when margins are driven
    down by competition. Using simple, but intelligent refinements that are unique
    like the DV2 give you an edge that your competitors do not have.

    opportunities and several different strategy ideas (no more gratuitous plugging
    of my own indicators!).
