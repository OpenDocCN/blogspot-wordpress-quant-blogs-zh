    with inadequate Aggregate Demand, as if this is some simple analytical construct
    that is just as meaningful as the demand for apples. This is nonsense. Aggregate
    Demand and Aggregate Supply are incoherent constructs that require heroic assumptions.
    You might as well talk about the current law of motion on the Hegelian Dialectic,
    which for decades was discussed as if it were real. Things exist before people
    know they exist (eg, nations, atoms), and things also don't exist even when many
    are certain they do (eg, anthropomorphic God, aether, phlogiston). About what
    one can not speak, one should remain silent, and you can't talk about something
    that is as logically vacuous as aggregate supply and demand.

    to innumerable other consumer wants. This is why the demand curve slopes downward,
    because the more it costs, the more you have to forgo of other stuff. Demand curves
    are driven by consumer utility (which decreases as one consumes more of a specific
    good), and income (which shifts it about). For supply curves, the correlate to
    utility curves are cost curves. One generally produces where marginal cost equals
    price, and so marginal cost is increasing (if it were decreasing, you could increase
    supply and lower costs for a 'given' price). Thus, you only raise your output
    if the price rises.

    of perishable goods arise in supply, or demand for cranberries increases before
    Thanksgiving. The logic of supply and demand curves in markets is firmly based
    on utility and cost functions, and is a very useful way to think about things.

    a relative price, but rather an absolute price level, which by itself is meaningless.
    If there was only one good in any economy people cared about, what would its 'price'
    even mean? So, right off the bat, something's fishy. Supposedly, in normal times
    the AD curve slopes down, we think, because other things equal a higher price
    level increases the demand for money, which drives up interest rates, which reduces
    investment and spending. But how does one increase the price level and leave 'other
    things equal?' One can imagine doing this in partial equilibrium, but it's a strange
    thing to contemplate over all goods. Further, at interest rate levels like today,
    it's not as if lowering interest rates is having any effect on investment (the
    liquidity trap, which is occurs always in real time for Keynesians, who always
    say this is why government spending is necessary now).

    people''s real balances, because presumably their cash levels are constant but
    magically prices move, affecting real wealth, CashValue/Price. However, offsetting
    that is the ''Fisher real balance effect'', where one''s debts change in real
    value. These debt effects are generally thought of as more important, and why
    most macroeconomists believe a little inflation would be good right now, and perhaps
    always: it reduces the legacy debt in real terms.'

    caused by changes in real rates from changing the price level. Supposedly lower
    interest rates lead to capital account deficit, which a trade surplus, which implies
    higher GDP. The data on this are mixed, but generally international trade is the
    tail, not the dog, for large countries like the USA.

    the Keynesian world vertical. It supposedly becomes positively sloped because
    'prices' refers to outputs, not inputs. Why prices supposedly effect finished
    goods rather than wages or intermediate goods is strictly

    more on X increases aggregate demand via their spending, because one becomes inured

    earnest, and prolix researchers, it's best just not to go there, because it's
    gibberish. Don't say Aggregate Demand, say, subsidies to investment of some kind,
    or more government spending, because that's more meaningful, and then ask, should
    we be subsidizing these investments, or having more government spending? The indirect
    effects are so speculative you might as well ignore them, and just ask if the
    direct effects are worthwhile.
