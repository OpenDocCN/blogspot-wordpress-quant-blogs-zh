- en: I have been maintaining for a long time (particularly in the [subscriber newsletter](http://vixandmoresubscriber.blogspot.com/)),
    that the key to the bottoming process in the economy is [housing](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/housing)
    and the key to housing prices is inventory.

  zh: 我长期以来一直认为（特别是在[订阅者通讯](http://vixandmoresubscriber.blogspot.com/)中），经济触底过程的关键是[房屋](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/housing)和房屋价格的关键是库存。
- en: While housing prices continue to fall, yesterday was the first glimpse of hope
    on the inventory front in a long time. In the graphic below, I have captured the
    months of supply of housing inventory since 1963\. Note that the December data
    show the biggest drop in housing inventories in 28 years.

  zh: 尽管房屋价格继续下跌，但昨天是长期以来库存方面的首次希望之光。在下图中，我捕捉到了自1963以来的房屋库存供应月数。请注意，12月的数据显示，房屋库存28年来最大降幅。
- en: Before anyone gets too excited about this development, however, a couple of
    caveats are in order. Considering that months of supply is a function of total
    inventory and the transaction rate, there are several moving parts in these calculations.
    The fact that housing inventory is still at levels comparable to what was seen
    in early 2004 means that in absolute terms, there is still a room for considerable
    improvement before the inventory issue is addressed. Further, in some parts of
    the country the majority of the transactions are related to foreclosure activity.
    Given the high elasticity of foreclosure sales, this component of the transaction
    rate has to be taken with a very large grain of salt.

  zh: 然而，在任何人对此发展过于兴奋之前，有几个警告是必要的。考虑到供应月数是总库存和交易率的函数，这些计算中有几个移动的部分。房屋库存仍然处于与2004年初所见水平相当的水平，这意味着在绝对意义上，库存问题在得到解决之前还有很大的改进空间。此外，全国某些地区的多数交易与止赎活动有关。考虑到止赎销售的弹性很高，这一交易率的组成部分必须非常小心对待。
- en: The economy has likely not yet reached a bottom, but there are encouraging signs.
    If housing inventory continues to fall and [cash starts departing money market
    funds](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/01/chart-of-week-change-of-trend-in-cash.html)
    in search of better returns, then it is possible to at least entertain the possibility
    that equities have turned the corner.

  zh: 经济可能尚未触底，但已有令人鼓舞的迹象。如果房屋库存继续下降，并且现金开始从货币市场基金中流出，寻求更好的回报，那么可以至少考虑一下股票可能已经转角的可能性。
