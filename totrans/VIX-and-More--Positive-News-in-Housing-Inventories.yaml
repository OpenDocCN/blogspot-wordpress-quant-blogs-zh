    that the key to the bottoming process in the economy is [housing](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/housing)
    and the key to housing prices is inventory.

    on the inventory front in a long time. In the graphic below, I have captured the
    months of supply of housing inventory since 1963\. Note that the December data
    show the biggest drop in housing inventories in 28 years.

    caveats are in order. Considering that months of supply is a function of total
    inventory and the transaction rate, there are several moving parts in these calculations.
    The fact that housing inventory is still at levels comparable to what was seen
    in early 2004 means that in absolute terms, there is still a room for considerable
    improvement before the inventory issue is addressed. Further, in some parts of
    the country the majority of the transactions are related to foreclosure activity.
    Given the high elasticity of foreclosure sales, this component of the transaction
    rate has to be taken with a very large grain of salt.

    If housing inventory continues to fall and [cash starts departing money market
    funds](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/01/chart-of-week-change-of-trend-in-cash.html)
    in search of better returns, then it is possible to at least entertain the possibility
    that equities have turned the corner.
