    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    of the trading model is high, and it has varied between 150% to 200% per month.

- en: Notwithstanding the short-term effects of geopolitical tension, consider the
    longer term inflationary pressures, which are building not just in the US but
    globally. Ned Davis Research recently pointed out that roughly two-thirds of countries
    are growing above their long-term potential. Unless these countries can increase
    their potential through faster labor force or productivity growth, inflationary
    pressures begin to build, followed by central bank tightening. We could reach
    recessionary conditions in the next year or so.
