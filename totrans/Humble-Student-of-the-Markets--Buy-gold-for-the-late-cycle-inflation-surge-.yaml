    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    signal. A bullish Trend Model signal that gets less bullish is a trading "sell"
    signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading
    "buy" signal. The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of
    the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. The turnover rate
    of the trading model is high, and it has varied between 150% to 200% per month.

- en: Notwithstanding the short-term effects of geopolitical tension, consider the
    longer term inflationary pressures, which are building not just in the US but
    globally. Ned Davis Research recently pointed out that roughly two-thirds of countries
    are growing above their long-term potential. Unless these countries can increase
    their potential through faster labor force or productivity growth, inflationary
    pressures begin to build, followed by central bank tightening. We could reach
    recessionary conditions in the next year or so.

    by capacity constraints, which would lead to an inflationary revival. Gold prices
    are currently testing a key resistance level. Should it stage an upside breakout,
    who know how far they could go.

    inflation momentum is rising.

    anticipation of a late cycle inflation surge? Not so fast! There are two sides
    to every story, and the bull case for gold may be too facile to be true.
