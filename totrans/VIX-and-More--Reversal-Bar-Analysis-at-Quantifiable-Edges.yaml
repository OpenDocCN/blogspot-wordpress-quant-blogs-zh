- en: I have been impressed by the breadth of top notch analytical thinking across
    the investment blog world in the past few weeks and have found many insights of
    note from some of the stalwarts on my blogroll. For the moment, however, I want
    to highlight one new blog, [Quantifiable Edges](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/),
    authored by Rob Hanna, that has particularly impressed me with some timely and
    thought provoking analysis.
