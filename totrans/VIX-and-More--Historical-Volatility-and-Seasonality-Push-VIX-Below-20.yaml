    August 2008, ultimately closing at a 16 month low of 19.54 today.

- en: When I called for a sub-20 VIX last Wednesday in [Historical Volatility Pointing
    to a Sub-20 VIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/12/historical-volatility-pointing-to-sub.html),
    the crux of my argument was that “if HV [[historical volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/historical%20volatility)]
    continues to fall, the case for a 20+ VIX will deteriorate rapidly. Substantial
    divergences tend to have a relatively short life. With the current divergence
    now at six trading days, the VIX can only defy gravity for a short while longer.”
    I further noted seasonal factors (such as the [holiday effect](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Holiday%20Effect))
    at work and was also emboldened in my prediction by what I call [calendar reversion](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/calendar%20reversion)
    – the tendency of the VIX to fall an extra 1% or so on Fridays due to market makers
    adjusting prices ahead of the weekend to compensate for the mismatch between the
    five day trading week and the seven day calendar week.

- en: Now that the VIX has closed below 20, however, there is no reason to assume
    it will not go lower. Even without accounting for seasonal factors, which include
    a 3 ½ day trading week this week followed by a 4 day trading week next week, current
    historical volatility data suggest a fair value for the VIX in the mid-17s.

    VIX that is more than a point or two away from the 20s, today should go a long
    way toward muting the cry that a VIX of 20 is sufficiently low to necessitate
    a selloff in stocks.
