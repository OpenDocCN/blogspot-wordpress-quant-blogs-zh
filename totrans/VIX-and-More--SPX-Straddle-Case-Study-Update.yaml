    for illustrative purposes only. As a consequence, I rarely feel an obligation
    to follow up on a previous post that identified a possible trade.

    the timing and the math just happened to work out so nicely.

    I outlined my opinion that I thought there was a strong chance the SPX “would
    settle in a trading range of 820-980.” I also mentioned the “possibility that
    the SPX might start to feel some gravitational pull around the 900 mark and start
    trading in an even narrower range, with the 900 area becoming a No Man’s Land
    of sorts.”

    to harvest some volatility as income, I suggested a menu of strategies that included
    [straddles](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/straddle), [strangles](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/strangle),
    [condors](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/condor), and [butterflies](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/butterfly).

    the S&P 500 index (SPX) as the underlying. With the SPX trading at just a shade
    over 900 at the time, the puts and calls could each be sold for 30.00 per contract.
    Fast forward one week and the SPX is still hovering around 900\. After one week
    of time decay and a VIX that has fallen approximately 10% during that period,
    both the puts and calls have had their prices cut in half, from 30.00 to 15.00\.

    crap shot, but it is interesting to see a real life case study in time decay in
    which all the numbers behave as they normally do only in a textbook.
