    added a chapter on trading systems. I will report later on the quality of this
    chapter if I can get a block of free time to read it.

- en: . I ordered this book after reading my colleague Ted's glowing review of the
    book on Amazon. I have to admit that, for me, the book was a bit on the disappointing
    side. The book has a little bit of everything ... a simple crossing engine, some
    messaging (designed to illustrate how STP works), some encryption, some good example
    of networking, etc.

    deals with the entire spectrum of financial instruments from a developer's point
    of view. Something that will not only discuss the business domain and underlying
    technology, but will also point to real products that implement the various systems.
    A deep dive for the developer to become completly immersed in Wall Street systems.

    what goes on from the time that a trade is entered until someone receives confirmation
    through snailmail. I want to know what an order entry system does, how trades
    are routed to the exchanges, how FIX messaging is used, how crossing engines and
    auto-execution engines work, how stat arb and algorithmic trading factors in,
    how market-making functions, how settlment is done, how positions are maintained
    and how P&L are calculated, how market data gets into a system, how risk is calculated,
    etc. I want to know how systems and vendors like Bloomberg, Fidessa, Reuters,
    Wombat, Vhayu, etc fit into this space.

    towards the financial systems developer. How to develop low-latency systems. How
    to write UI's with fast-updating grids of market data. How to use complex event
    processing to implement stat arb trading. How to do order routing efficiently
    using rules engines.

    there is a real need for this kind of knowledge to be put on paper.
