# Humble Student of the Markets: In the eyes of the beholder

**Mid-week market update**

: Technical analysis can be highly interpretative. Consider, for example, the bull or bear flag, which is a continuation pattern. For the uninitiated, a bull flag is a pullback within a bull trend and the trend is deemed to have continued when the stock or index stages an upside breakout from the flag. The reverse holds for a bear flag.

With that brief explanation in mind, did the S&P 500 just break out of a bull flag, or is it still tracing out bear flag?

Bullishness and bearishness are in the eyes of the beholder.
