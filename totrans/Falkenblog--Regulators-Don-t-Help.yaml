    regulators. They are totally out of their depth, not understanding where risk
    really lies because the essential information simply can't be grasped by flying
    in and looking and talking to people for 2 weeks. I have never worked in a financial
    firm where I felt I understood what was really going on for at least a couple
    years. They fill out reports conceived by someone ten years ago that would have
    caught last decade's big error, and come back next year. The good ones, and there
    are many, realize the futility, but it's a paycheck.

    pre 2007 regulators encouraged mortgage lending without qualification. Now, the
    issue is Greek debt. John Cochrane

    As banks have been increasing capital, they have loaded up even more on “risk-free”
    sovereign debt, which they can use as collateral for ECB loans. The big ECB “liquidity
    operation” that took place yesterday will give banks hundreds of billions of euros
    to increase their sovereign bets...So much for the faith that regulation will
    keep banks safe....They keep looking for the Big Announcement that will soothe
    markets into rolling over another few hundred billion euros of debt. Alas, the
    problem is reality, not psychology
