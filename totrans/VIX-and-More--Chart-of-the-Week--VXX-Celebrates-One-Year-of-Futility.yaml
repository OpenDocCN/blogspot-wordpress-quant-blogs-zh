    ([VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX)) was rolled out to little
    fanfare, with the exception of the [widespread coverage](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/01/first-day-of-trading-in-vxx-and-vxz.html)
    that VXX and sibling [VXZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX) received
    here when the ETNs were launched.

    is down 68.4% and the VIX is down 42.2%.

    to lose money in an ETF over the course of the last year. Putting the 68.4% loss
    in VXX in perspective, there were only two other ETFs in which investors could
    have lost 50% of their investment: short financials ([SEF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SEF)),
    which were down 52%; and short emerging markets ([EUM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EUM)),
    which fell 50%. Long natural gas ([UNG](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/UNG))
    and short base metals ([BOS](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/BOS))
    would both have resulted in losses of 48%.'

    captures the VXX in all its futility, with a ratio of VXX to the VIX on top to
    see how VXX has underperformed the cash/spot volatility index throughout the past
    year.

- en: The links below explain the manner in which negative [roll yield](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/roll%20yield)
    and other factors have caused VXX to underperform the VIX and turn in such as
    disastrous performance. All things considered, I expect VXX to perform better
    relative to the VIX in its second year than it did in its first year, though admittedly
    this is not a very high bar to clear.
