    stake in Citigroup ([C](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/C)); blue
    chip stalwarts JPMorgan Chase ([JPM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/JPM))
    and General Electric ([GE](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/GE)) both
    slashed their dividends; durable goods and housing data failed to meet already
    lowered expectations; Q4 [GDP](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/GDP)
    was revised down to a 6.2% annualized drop; and the S&P 500 index fell to levels
    not seen since 1996.'

    the exception of the GDP data, which delivered a knockout blow Friday morning.
    The GDP numbers are notoriously backward-looking and the revisions to advance
    GDP data lend very little to the existing body of economic knowledge. That being
    said, Friday’s GDP numbers touched a statistical and psychological nerve for a
    market that was just not prepared to digest another assessment of how sharp the
    economic fall has been.

- en: This week’s [chart of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week)
    attempts to put the most recent GDP number in historical perspective. While not
    shown on the chart, the raw GDP for the fourth quarter of 2008 is at approximately
    the level of economic activity that prevailed in June 2007\. Also, while the 6.2%
    (annualized) drop in Q4 GDP is quite concerning, it is less than what we saw in
    the first quarter of 1982 (-6.4%) and the second quarter of 1980 (-7.8%). Going
    back even further (and not shown on the chart), GDP dropped a whopping 10.4% in
    the first quarter of 1958.

    By this measure, the current situation still has a way to go before it compares
    to 1991, not to mention the even larger four quarter dips in the 1970s and 1980s
    referenced above.

- en: A [survey](http://www.philadelphiafed.org/research-and-data/real-time-center/survey-of-professional-forecasters/2009/survq109.cfm)
    of 43 economic forecasters published two weeks ago by the Federal Reserve Bank
    of Philadelphia showed expectations for a 5.2% drop in Q1 2009 GDP, followed by
    a 1.8% drop in Q2\. Given the most recent revisions to the Q4 data, a 5.2% drop
    in the current quarter may be on the optimistic side, but the burning question
    right now is whether Q3 can show any growth at all – or at least a decrease in
    the rate of economic deterioration.
