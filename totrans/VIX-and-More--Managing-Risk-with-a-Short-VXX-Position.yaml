    I should pass along a recent reader Q&A in post format in order to capture the
    attention of a broader audience. By the way, if you would like to see more Q&A
    in this space or have a specific question you are longing for an answer to, just
    hit up the comments section below.

    far this year. I want to protect that gain, but my belief is that VXX will continue
    much lower allowing for even more reward.*'

    VIX spikes, the size of your VXX short will increase, while the size of your XIV
    long will decrease. This has implications for position concentration and potential
    margin issues, etc. It also means that instead of having losses compound if the
    VIX continues to rise, there will be a diminution of incremental losses.

    in a row a short VXX position will lose $10,000, then $11,000, then $12,100\.
    On the other hand a long XIV position would lose $10,000, then $9,000, then $8,100\.
    In only a few days, the daily losses become 50% higher in short VXX than in long
    XIV. The longer the increase in volatility persists and the bigger the daily moves
    are, the larger the difference becomes. Recall that in April-May 2010, the VIX
    tripled in a month and VXX doubled. You might want to walk through how you can
    protect yourself should something like that happen again.
