- en: I examined implications of market action directly after FTD’s. In that post
    I found this early action to be a strong indication of whether a FTD was likely
    to succeed or not. A move higher in the SPX over the 1st 5 days after a FTD led
    to a successful rally about 2/3 of the time.

- en: In the current situation “success” would be a move to 1,147.41 or higher. This
    is just barely under the January high of 1,150.45\. In other words, based on this
    study, there appears to be a good chance the market will at least test its January
    highs before it breaks its February lows. One thing to note is that there still
    has not been a FTD under the current (1.7% gain) IBD definition, so it will be
    interesting to see what happens here.
