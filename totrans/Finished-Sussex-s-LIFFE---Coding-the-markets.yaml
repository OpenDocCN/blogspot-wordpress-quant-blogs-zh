- en: Sussex discusses the shift from LIFEE to Eurex for the Bund contract towards
    the end of the book, but doesn’t offer any special insight. There’s a few comments
    on the Eurex Flipper too, and how he angered locals on Eurex by kidding money
    out of them. One could argue that the locals were kidding money out of the ‘real’
    market participants. Having worked as a local at times, that’s not Sussex’s point
    of view. All in all, an enjoyable read, albeit without eureka moments.
