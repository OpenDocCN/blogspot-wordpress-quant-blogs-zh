    started out with the unwieldy title of [Trends in Economic Data Relative to Expectations](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/07/trends-in-economic-data-relative-to.html).

    releases relative to consensus expectations.

    expectations. I then aggregate the data over time to see the extent to which certain
    segments of the economy are trending higher or lower relative to expectations.

- en: The chart tells a couple of interesting stories for 2010\. First, it was the
    manufacturing sector which provided the bulk of the positive surprises during
    the first half of the year and the propelled stocks to their April highs.
  prefs: []

- en: Manufacturing began to turn down in May, following stocks down. This was just
    about the time that housing and construction started to provide some evidence
    of positive surprises, but that sector did nothing to stem the tide of falling
    stock prices.

- en: When stocks started to turn around at the end of August and make their big bullish
    move for the year, this coincided with an improving employment picture, a rebound
    in manufacturing and an upturn in the consumer.

- en: Over the course of the year, economic data came very close to meeting expectations
    for all sectors except housing and construction, which was the surprise winner
    in the data vs. expectations sweepstakes.
  prefs: []

- en: Finally, as the year came to a close, it was employment which was most highly
    correlated with changes in stock prices, followed closely by a virtual dead heat
    between housing/construction and the consumer.
