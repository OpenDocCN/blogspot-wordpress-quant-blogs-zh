    As this puts this under the Treasury, as opposed to the Fed, it will be more compliant

    pretext of fairness, creating barriers of entry to various business lines that
    end up subsidizing business practices that payoff various special interests. That
    is, regulatory capture works by making the redistribution conspicuous and welcomed
    by industry, who accept this for being able to keep outcompetitors via 'suitability'
    requirements such as whether agents are sufficiently licensed, or firms have sufficient
    oversight to provide check cashing services.

    from the masses voting to take money from the rich, who are relatively few, and
    appropriating this to the more numerous masses (who wouldn''t vote for Bill Gates
    giving them each a $100 check? He could afford it, and still be a billionaire!).
    One can argue that inegalitarian distributions are bad for several reasons: because
    inequality causes civil unrest; it causes a glut of savings; the market is crooked
    anyway, or a Rawlsian argument that market value is the result of arbitrary power
    and preferences that have nothing to do with one''s ''true worth''. I think it''s
    more honest to say people are envious, and as inequality generates a pyramid with
    a relative few at the top, this is not resilient to coalitions of those more numerous
    on the bottom. Pathetic, but such is the crooked timber of humanity.'

    The desire to increase efficiency via ensuring people follow the rules (basically,
    adding criminal punishment to that of the market for lying, cheating and stealing).
    Then there is the desire to reduce poverty, or equalize outcomes between various
    ethnic and racial groups.

    explicit racial quotas or mathematical formulas to achieve racial balance, it
    is happy enough to measure the success of its preferred fuzzier approaches in
    statistical terms. If a selection system is going to be judged by its success
    in approximating the results of a mathematical formula, how is it any different
    from using that formula explicitly? ... And if [discrimination] can be measured
    and judged using statistics, why is it wrong to achieve the statistical goal through
    statistical means?

    impact ethnic minority groups, businesses must demonstrate that such tests are
    "reasonably related" to the job for which the test is required. This latter point
    is very difficult to prove in practice, which is why federal civil service exams
    got rid of standardized tests in 1981\. So Title 7 contains a requirement that
    firms do not discriminate ex ante or ex post, in treatment or in effect.

    involves discriminating based on ability and willingness to pay, which is not
    distributed according to our preferences as to how the world should be. Finance
    is highly regulated, and many regulations are targeted towards treating people
    'fairly', which mainly means redistributing outcomes towards politically powerful
    but economically marginal groups. As many advocates target 'the poor' directly,
    this leads to really bizarre stances, such as HUD advocating reworking a 125%
    Loan-to-Value mortgage while the OCC monitors leverage ratios of small business
    loans; simultaneously telling banks to increase their capital and also to loan
    more, etc. You can't advocate banks serve poor groups as well as the rich without
    messing up everything. It's like trying to fatten up the slower fish at the bottom
    of the tank—the big fast guys are going to burst before these poor souls get fatter.

    clusterpuck of financial regulation. In a democracy, policy makers exhibit the
    precise amount of hypocrisy demanded of them—no one campaigns with equal emphasis
    on increasing (or decreasing) spending & taxes. This comes at a cost, and listening
    to all these great new initiatives to help poor people via preventing foreclosures,
    or not raising their interest rates, creates a myriad of responses that in the
    end just make the system less efficient, which means it has less wealth. In an
    economy with mass immigration from the third-world, means less income for the
    unskilled.
