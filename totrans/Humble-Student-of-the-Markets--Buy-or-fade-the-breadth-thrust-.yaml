- en: The recent price surge in late May off the bottom produced a flurry of excitement
    among technical analysts. Extreme price momentum is known as a breadth thrust
    in chartist circles. Depending on the magnitude of the breadth thrust, they are
    often signals of new bull markets.

    in his book, *Winning on Wall Street*, which was first published in 1986\. A ZBT
    buy signal is generated when NYSE breadth moves from an oversold extreme to an
    overbought extreme within 10 trading days. ZBT signals are very rare. The book
    described 14 signals since 1945\. The average gain following these 14 Thrusts
    was 24.6% within 11 months.

    the breadth thrust in 11 days, not 10\. Since then, a number of chartists have

    good as the classic ZBT buy signal. As an example,

    8.4% some 6 month out, which is equivalent to a 84.6% accuracy. If you relaxed
    the positive outcome holding period from 6 months to 12 months, then only the
    2001 signal provided a negative outcome, increasing the accuracy to 92%. In fact,
    an examination of an actuarial table of the SP-500 gains for various holding periods
    after each ZBT-A signal yields some more interesting results.
