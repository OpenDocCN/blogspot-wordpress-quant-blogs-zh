- en: On Monday QQQQ posted a higher high and a lower low than Friday. This is often
    referred to as an “outside day”. Interestingly, Friday was also an outside day.
    Two outside days in a row is quite rare. This was only the 19th time it’s been
    done since 2000\. Looking at performance following the other 18 times shows some
    compelling results.
