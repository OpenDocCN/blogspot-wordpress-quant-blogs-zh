    I just could not resist the opportunity to port their improved moving average
    idea to R and run some additional tests.  The entire process was extremely pleasant
    due to the authors’ willingness to test, comment, and suggest throughout the implementation
    process.  Thanks so much to them for all their help.

    to a [Mebane Faber](http://mebanefaber.com) style 10-month moving average system.

    generous and helpful as I worked through this process.  To even better demonstrate
    the power of open-source, I will use ttrTests to do additional testing and then
    the bt examples from [http://systematicinvestor.wordpress.com](http://systematicinvestor.wordpress.com)

    very slight change markedly changes the results.
