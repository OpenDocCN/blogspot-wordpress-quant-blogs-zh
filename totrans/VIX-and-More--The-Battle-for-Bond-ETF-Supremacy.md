[![](img/546966b916cca79df67ed6785d1d2d7e.png)](http://i104.photobucket.com/albums/m163/bl82/Sean_Connery_as_Bond.jpg)Over the weekend, there was an interesting [MarketWatch.com](http://www.marketwatch.com/) article, "[In come more bond ETFs: Vanguard enters wide-open market as Barclays throws out the 'junk,'](http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/etf-giants-engage-battle-bonds/story.aspx?guid=%7bCCFC7981-732B-4BCF-AB0B-9026A1F70DC5%7d&siteid=yhoo&dist=yhoo&print=true&dist=printTop)" about the battle for bond ETF supremacy between Barclays (BGI) and Vanguard, with BGI landing the first few punches.  Two items in particular caught my interest:

1.  BGI's launch of the first high yield ETF, the [iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond Fund](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=hyg) (ticker HYG); and 
2.  the very low 0.11% expense rates for the Vanguard bond ETFs

Specific to VIX, volatility and risk, I can see future applications involving the use of a high yield ETF with a government long bond ETF like [TLT](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=tlt) to look at ratio charts (unfortunately, [StockCharts.com](http://stockcharts.com/) does not yet have HYG in their database,) price differential charts, etc.  This type of analysis might turn out to be a good complement to the [Markit](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/03/credit-default-swap-canary.html) [Credit Default Swap](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_default_swap) data.

Looking more at the [“…and More](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/and%20More)” side of the ledger, here are a handful of ETF-related links that I get a lot of value from:

Finally, while the bond ETF field is already getting crowded, I thought I might point out a half dozen ETFs that have consistently high volume and consequently are as appropriate for trading as they are for longer term investing: 

*   [SHY](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=shy) - iShares Lehman 1-3 Year Treasury Bond Fund
*   [IEF](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ief) - iShares Lehman 7-10 Year Treasury Bond Fund
*   [TLT](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=tlt) - iShares Lehman 20+ Year Treasury Bond Fund
*   [AGG](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=agg) - iShares Lehman Aggregate Bond Fund
*   [LQD](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=LQD) - iShares iBoxx $ Invest Grade Corp Bond Fund
*   [TIP](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=tip) - iShares Lehman TIPS Bond Fund
