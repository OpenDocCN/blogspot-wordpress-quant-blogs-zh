    a high degree of risk that income oriented investors cannot tolerate. I do understand,
    however, the dilemma facing such investors who need a regular stream of income.

    may mitigate some of the risks involved.

- en: The latest BoAML Fund Manager Survey shows that many managers believe that US
    high yield, or junk bonds, are getting to be a crowded long. On the other hand,
    emerging market bonds, which carry similar levels of risk, are not. So if you're
    going to take extra risk and reach for yield, EM bonds may be a better alternative
    than US HY.

    the other involves an interest rate sensitivity bet as well as a bet on the relative
    credit quality as well as a bet on the USD (see my post

- en: Investors who want to keep a risk-adjusted yield maximization strategy simple
    can just buy EMB. A more sophisticated strategy might be to buy EMB and short
    HYG, but that would involve taking on interest rate risk. An interest rate neutral
    strategy would be to buy long EMB/short IEF pair and then short the HYG/IEI pair
    (long EMB, IEI, short HYG, IEF).

    speculative and these strategies are on the higher risk end of the investment
    spectrum. Nevertheless, I believe that, on a risk-adjusted basis, EM bonds might
    be a better way of reaching for yield in the current environment for those who
    can accept the risks involved.
