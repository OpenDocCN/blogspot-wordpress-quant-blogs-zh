    it would help their cause a lot if they made unambiguous statements prior to the

    (indeed, I find the best history showing how while some event was inevitable,
    it was not obvious at the time). Further, even if some people were correct they
    had to have been correct for the right reasons. If, like Nouriel Roubini, you
    were a permabear predicting a cataclysm for the same reasons as always, the fact
    of the credit crisis doesn't mean you called it. Or take my Nassim Taleb, who's
