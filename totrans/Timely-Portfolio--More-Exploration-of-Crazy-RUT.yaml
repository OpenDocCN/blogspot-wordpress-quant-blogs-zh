    to build systems (STANDARD DISCLAIMER: NOT INVESTMENT ADVICE AND WILL LOSE LOTS
    OF MONEY SO PROCEED WITH CAUTION) based on the Jarque Bera test of normality ([entry
    in Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarque%E2%80%93Bera_test) or the research
    paper [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=18293285759900281575&hl=en&as_sdt=0,1](http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=18293285759900281575&hl=en&as_sdt=0,1
    "http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=18293285759900281575&hl=en&as_sdt=0,1")). 
    Since I was only playing around, I sort of deliberately curve fitted a system
    to work on the Russell 2000.  After a lot of experimentation, I came up with something
    very interesting, which led me to test on multiple other indexes.  It seemed to
    only really work well on the Russell 2000 and mainly over the last 5 years, which
    of course led me right back to the question posed in [Crazy RUT](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2011/07/crazy-rut.html)
    and explored again in [Crazy RUT in Academic Context Why Trend is Not Your Friend](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2012/06/crazy-rut-in-academic-context.html),
    which is “Why don’t most momentum systems work over the last decade on the Russell
    2000 when they work on almost all other indexes?”  Please let me know if you have
    a good explanation, or if you want to test for regimes. Here is the result. I
    apologize that I spent little time on making these pretty.'

    shows different results.
