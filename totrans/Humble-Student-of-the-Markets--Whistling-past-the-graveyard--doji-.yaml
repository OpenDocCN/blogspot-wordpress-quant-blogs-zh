    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    out of the gate and pushed major market indices to fresh all-time highs. By the
    end of the month, the market had retreated to end the month slightly in the red.
    More importantly, the monthly chart printed a graveyard doji, which is often interpreted
    as a sign of trend reversal.
