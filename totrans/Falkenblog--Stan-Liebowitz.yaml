- en: 'Fannie Mae announced: Spurred in part by the FHEFSSA mandate, Fannie Mae announced
    a trillion-dollar commitment. The result has been a wider variety of innovative
    mortgage products. The GSEs have introduced a new generation of affordable, flexible,
    and targeted mortgages, thereby fundamentally altering the terms upon which mortgage
    credit was offered in the United States from the 1960s through the 1980s. Moreover,
    these secondary-market innovations have proceeded in tandem with shifts in the
    primary markets: depository institutions, spurred by the threat of CRA challenges
    and the lure of significant profit potential in underserved markets, have pioneered
    flexible mortgage products. For years, depositories held these products in portfolios
    when their underwriting guidelines exceeded benchmarks set by the GSEs. Current
    shifts in government policy, GSE acquisition criteria, and the primary market
    have fostered greater integration of capital and lending markets.'

  zh: 房利美宣布：在某种程度上受FHEFSSA法令的推动，房利美宣布了一万亿美元的承诺。其结果是推出了更多创新的抵押贷款产品。 转包企业（GSEs）推出了一代新的负担得起、灵活和有针对性的抵押贷款，从而从20世纪60年代到80年代从根本上改变了美国提供抵押信贷的条款。
    此外，这些次级市场的创新与初级市场的变化同时进行：存款机构，受到CRA挑战威胁和未开发市场潜在巨大利润的诱惑，率先推出了灵活的抵押贷款产品。 多年来，当存款机构的承销指南超过GSEs设定的基准时，这些产品一直由存款机构持有。
    当前的政府政策变化、GSE收购标准和初级市场促进了资本和信贷市场的更紧密融合。

    infected the entire industry. What you will not find, if you read the housing
    literature from 1990 until 2006, is any fear that perhaps these weaker lender
    standards that every government agency involved with housing tried to advance,
    that congress tried to advance, that the presidency tried to advance, that the
    GSEs tried to advance, and with which the penitent banks initially went along
    and eventually enthusiastically supported, might lead to high defaults, particularly
    if housing prices should stop rising.

  zh: 一个人的创新对另一个人可能是毒药，如在这种情况下一种感染整个行业的毒药。 如果你读了从1990年到2006年的房地产文献，你就不会发现任何恐惧，即也许这些较弱的放贷标准，即每个涉足住房的政府机构、国会尝试推进的、总统尝试推进的、GSEs尝试推进的、以及信贷机构一开始配合后来积极推动的，可能导致高违约率，特别是如果住房价格停止上涨的话。
- en: Liebowitz also goes over a Bear Stearn's sales pitch from 1998, which argues
    the change in underwriting standards would have no impact. There was a lot of
    reliance on the Community Reinvestment Act, and the Boston Fed Study that supposedly
    showed racial discrimination was at fault for excessive minority mortgage rejections.
    The implication was clearly that having a negative view of these changes was almost
    racist. As bear Stearns showed, at least they were sincere.

  zh: 利博维茨还回顾了贝尔斯登（Bear Stearn's）在1998年的销售演说，认为贷款标准的变化不会产生影响。当时对《社区再投资法案》（CRA）的依赖很大，波士顿联邦储备银行的研究据称表明种族歧视是导致少数族裔贷款被拒绝过多的罪魁祸首。显然在暗示，对这些变化持负面看法几乎是种族主义。正如贝尔斯登所示，他们至少是真诚的。
