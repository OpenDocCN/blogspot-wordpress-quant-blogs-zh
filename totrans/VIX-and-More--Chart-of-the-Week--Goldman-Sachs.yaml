- en: There is no reason to get fancy with this week’s [chart of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week).
    The big story of the week was accusations of fraud at Goldman Sachs ([GS](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/GS)),
    with the SEC claiming Goldman misrepresented the selection process for some collateralized
    debt obligations (CDOs) resulting in a fraud worth $1 billion.

    selloff erased most of the gains in the stock from the last three months. Of particular
    interest is the spike in both [historical volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/historical%20volatility)
    (HV20) and [implied volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/implied%20volatility)
    (IV30), with historical volatility now higher than its forward-looking implied
    volatility counterpart. With elevated volatility, options traders are loving GS
    for now, whether they have thoughts about the future direction of GS stock or
    are just looking to sell options to capture the extra premium.
