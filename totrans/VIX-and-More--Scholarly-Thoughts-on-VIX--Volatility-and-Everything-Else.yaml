    Credit Suisse or BGI?  Think your interests are too narrow and arcane for normal

    obscure monthly and quarterly journals?  I think I may have a solution, albeit
    an imperfect one.

    from the leading academic journals across the globe without even having to leave
    your browser.  Google Scholar, which bears the motto, “Stand on the shoulders
    of giants,” is not to be taken lightly.  I asked for articles on [VIX and volatility](http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&lr=&safe=off&scoring=r&q=vix+volatility&as_ylo=2006)
    from just the past year and got 53 hits; searching the entire database yielded
