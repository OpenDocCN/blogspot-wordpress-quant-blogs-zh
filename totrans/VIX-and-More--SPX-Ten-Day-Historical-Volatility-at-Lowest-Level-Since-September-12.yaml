- en: There are quite a few ways in which to measure [historical volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/historical%20volatility).
    Probably the most responsive of the time periods commonly measured is the 10 day
    historical volatility (HV) period, which covers the last 10 trading days. Variously
    referred to as statistical volatility, realized volatility, actual volatility,
    etc., the 10 day historical volatility measure for the SPX (dotted blue line in
    chart below) peaked on October 22^(nd) at just a fraction under the 100 level.
    On December 3^(rd) the 10 day HV was still holding strong at 89, but it has fallen
    precipitously over the course of the last three weeks and is down to just 35 as
    of Wednesday’s close and on target to dip as low as 33 or so today.

    September 12^(th), just prior to the Lehman bankruptcy.

    that the recent historical volatility in the SPX has been slightly more than three
    quarters of that represented by the VIX. Of course, the December [holiday effect](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Holiday%20Effect)
    has artificially depressed volatility to some extent, but certainly cannot claim
    full responsibility for the drop in 10 day HV from 89 to 35.'
