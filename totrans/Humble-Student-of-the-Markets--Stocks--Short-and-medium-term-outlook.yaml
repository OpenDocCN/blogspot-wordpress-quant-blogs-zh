    the SPX made a new all-time high, major averages fell, led by the NASDAQ and small
    caps. The decline of the SPX violated the 50 day moving average (dma) and ended
    the week at the bottom of a support zone.

    when fewer companies than average beat estimates, the trend continues throughout
    the full earnings season, and vice versa.*** Although the last two quarters have
    been exceptions, the current 52% beat rate is the lowest since the Q4 2010 preseason,
    as seen below in Exhibit 1.

    it difficult for companies to surprise analysts as they have in the past.

    Not quite. Nothing goes up or down in a straight line and the stock market is
    getting oversold. Bearish sentiment is getting a little overdone in the short
    term and stock prices are poised for a counter-trend rally at any time.

    a bounce. As an example, the relative performance of QQQ against SPY shows that
    the relative decline of the pair is now sitting at about the 50% retracement of
    the relative up move that began about a year ago. As well, it is showing a positive
    divergence on the 14 day RSI, which indicates the loss of selling momentum. These
    are are signs that if the panic selling were to pause and a relief rally were
    to occur, this would be the ideal spot.

    small body with a shadow at least two times greater than the body. Found at the
    bottom of a downtrend, this shows evidence that the bulls are stepping in, but
    the selling is still going on. The color of the small body is not important but
    the white body has more bullish indications than a black body. A positive day
    is required the following day to confirm this signal.

    from Friday's close to the aforementioned targets at the 4220-4230 level, this
