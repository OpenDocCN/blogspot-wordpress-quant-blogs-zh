    maximize their own wealth. It's part of what makes them flint-eyed realists as
    opposed to naive social philosophers who think the world can be made better by
    convincing men to be selfless. That is, after being beaten up by utopians who
    envisaged a society ruled by thinking about society instead of themselves, most
    now see how selfishness is consistent with a growing economy (the invisible hand,
    Adam Smith), being nice (reciprocal altruism, see

    acceptable behavior. Envy is one of the Seven Deadly Sins, and is rather prominent
    in the Ten Commandments (coveting neighbor's goods, God's envy of other gods).
    So, compared to simple greed, it has a similar pedigree, even if we think it worse
    than greed.

    lack of a risk premium. I''m also OK with envy, in that we just started trying
    to figure out its implications, and it may turn out to be as innocuous, even beneficial,
    as with greed. For example, envy allows us to empathize with others who still
    don''t need our money to survive, which describes virtually all of the poor in
    America; it''s nice that we are charitable towards the poor today even though
    they are wealthy beyond anyone''s dreams prior to the 20th century. As envy is
    rather hard-wired it would be odd if it were completely dysfunctional to our species,
    and so I suspect it is essential in moderate doses because every instinct we have
    has some base benefit (greed, lust, pride). In any case, it can still be important
    even if it makes us all worse off.'

    watches, this seems to ignore the fact that almost all of the amenities of modern
    life are unanticipated benefits from someone who was probably partially driven
    by his desire to have the best car among his social circle. The great technology,
    art, and philosophy we enjoy is a by-product of selfish, and envious, individuals.
    Were we to prevent conspicuous consumption, how much less would we have? That's
    a hypothetical, but consider that many technologies started as baubles for the
    idle rich, and then became extremely useful for more mundane uses (no one anticipated
    computers or cars becoming essential household products).
