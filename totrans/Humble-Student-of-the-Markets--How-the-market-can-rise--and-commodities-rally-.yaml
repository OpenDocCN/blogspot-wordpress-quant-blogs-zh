    has begun a rate hike cycle when it sees inflationary pressures start to tick
    up. Everything else being equal, higher interest rates would be negative for equity
    valuations because E/P, which is the inverse of the P/E ratio, would fall and
    therefore depress P/E multiples. But everything else isn't equal. Typically, the
    negative effects of a slight P/E contraction are offset by better earnings growth,
    or bigger E in the P/E ratio. Indeed, the latest figures from

    The market will undoubtedly shift its focus to the evolution of the dot plots
    to see how quickly the Fed is likely to raise rates. Assuming that the FOMC does
    raise rates in December, the USD may very well see a reflex rally evaporate should

    hikes will be slow and shallow.
