    about my bullish outlook on equities and commodities. I have been repeatedly asked
    the question, "The Fed is likely to raise interest rates in December, wouldn't
    that be bearish for stocks, bullish for the USD and therefore bearish for commodities?"
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Not necessarily. There are two parts to that question. Historically, the Fed
    has begun a rate hike cycle when it sees inflationary pressures start to tick
    up. Everything else being equal, higher interest rates would be negative for equity
    valuations because E/P, which is the inverse of the P/E ratio, would fall and
    therefore depress P/E multiples. But everything else isn't equal. Typically, the
    negative effects of a slight P/E contraction are offset by better earnings growth,
    or bigger E in the P/E ratio. Indeed, the latest figures from

- en: What about the US Dollar? Isn't a rate hike USD bullish and therefore commodity
    bearish because of their inverse correlation? Not necessarily. The upcoming rate
    increase must be the most telegraphed initial rate hike in Federal Reserve history.
    The market will undoubtedly shift its focus to the evolution of the dot plots
    to see how quickly the Fed is likely to raise rates. Assuming that the FOMC does
    raise rates in December, the USD may very well see a reflex rally evaporate should
    Yellen makes it clear, as she is likely to, that the trajectory of future rate
    hikes will be slow and shallow.
