- en: In a painstaking forensic analysis of the sources of increased mortgage risk
    during the 2000s, "[The Failure of Models that Predict Failure](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1296982),"
    Uday Rajan of the University of Michigan, Amit Seru of the University of Chicago
    and Vikrant Vig of London Business School show that more than half of the mortgage
    losses that occurred in excess of the rosy forecasts of expected loss at the time
    of mortgage origination reflected the predictable consequences of low-doc and
    no-doc lending. In other words, if the mortgage-underwriting standards at Fannie
    and Freddie circa 2003 had remained in place, nothing like the magnitude of the
    subprime crisis would have occurred.
