    have very small staffs relative to the number of customers, and so have automated
    most of their support function. Thus, if you have a question ('how can I buy BTC
    for my IRA on your exchange?'), you'll get an auto-bot answer using an algorithm
    that finds the best fit your keywords. These are irrelevant to unorthodox questions,
