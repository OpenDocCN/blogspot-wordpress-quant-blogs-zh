    under its control. They have ultimate custody of all your financial assets, and
    custody is nine-tenths of the law. You simply can't hold $1M in financial assets
    in a form where 'The Man' can't grab it if he finds you an enemy of the state,
    which in many states includes righteous men.

    putting power back in individuals. We can now take classes online, and be evaluated
    objectively via tests, making Universities less important. We no longer have a
    handful of news sources, but a spectrum that allows us to choose among vastly
    different interpretations of the same data. And we have digital currencies, which
    exploit cryptography innovations aligned with processing power to create ways
    of assigning credits more efficiently than fiat currency.

    we can hold. Once  we severed its link to gold and silver, it still 'worked.'
    I would not have predicted that in 1900\. Money works because people accept it,

    skills into mining and developing the network, and as these highly productive
    people began to accumulate these assets, they appreciate its value. Since highly
    productive people appreciate these assets, they are valuable because they can
    be translated into purchasing the services of such people. Thus, initial coin
    offerings (ICOs) allow people to fund new businesses focused on blockchain technology
    because the same people creating these businesses are fine with getting paid in
    'tokens', something that would be hard to convince for your average person.

    seize is important, and cryptocurrencies allow you to do this. If a government
    tries to prohibit bitcoin, those with large bitcoin accounts will simply move
    to someplace that accepts it, like Singapore, and a country filled with those
    who appreciate and have a lot of bitcoin will tend to prosper. So unless the world
    governments can enforce a worldwide compact with over a hundred players, bitcoin
    will succeed, and I''m sure most smart countries will ultimately allow general
    digital currency use reluctantly, to avoid such a brain drain.'

    same blockchain, which creates greater functionality. If you go to Reddit, you'll
    see more development in 'Go', a cutting edge software language, in Ethereum projects,
    and there are already more wikis on GitHub for Ethereum projects than Bitcoin
    projects, so I'm confident that Ethereum will surpass Bitcoin in market cap someday,
    especially once they move to proof-of-stake (sometime next year).

    So I thought I would move some of my 401k into cyber currencies such as Ethereum
    (you can do BTC too, but I'll use ETH as the example).  Most 401ks and IRAs do
    not allow you to do this directly, and BitcoinIRA charges 10% to set up a Bitcoin
    IRA. I don't blame them for charging this much, as it's difficult, and as there's

    can move your USD into a mutual fund. You have set up an account at a cybercurrency exchange
    to do that, and most exchanges do not handle IRA transactions. The new regulated bitcoin exchanges
    have very small staffs relative to the number of customers, and so have automated
    most of their support function. Thus, if you have a question ('how can I buy BTC
    for my IRA on your exchange?'), you'll get an auto-bot answer using an algorithm
    that finds the best fit your keywords. These are irrelevant to unorthodox questions,
    and follow up questions just lead to more pointless autobot answers.

    meat-based neural nets by looking at their FAQs and copy and pasting answers from
    there. At Coinbase, if you follow up your question after not hearing anything
    for 3 days, they will assume you have changed your question, so it moves it to
    the back of their queue. Thus I had an issue where my question was never answered
    because every couple of days I would write, 'is anyone there?' which would put
    me back at the bottom of the queue, and my question was thus unanswered (and funds
    frozen) for 3 weeks.

    straightforward, however, as Kingdom Trust clearly stumbled into this capability,
    and they gave me a bunch of contradictory information, all standard confusion.
     I'm sure they and others will figure this all out eventually, but by the time
    it becomes easy to invest in digital currencies, the incentive will be a lot lower.
     So, be patient, it will happen, but just about every step takes at least a day.
