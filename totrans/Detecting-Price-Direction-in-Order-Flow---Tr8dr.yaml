- en: This can be used to reconstruct the orderbook at any given instant, but can
    also be used to analyze movements within the orderbook.   The most primitive approaches
    look at the incidence of size being removed or hitting a given price-level.  
     More sophisticated approaches try to determine order streams to see where an
    order is being moved to in the book.

    above is not yet terribly useful, as the cumulative flows look to follow the price
    path more or less during a period of momentum.

- en: The approach is particularly useful for understanding movements over a short
    to medium timeframe.   However long-running price movements often have periods
    of “indecision” where the flow and price flounders for a period.   Ultimately
    this sort of approach needs to be evaluated on multiple windows to accomodate
    various timeframes.
