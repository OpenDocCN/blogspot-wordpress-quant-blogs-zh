    the relationship between the magnitude of short-term VIX [mean reversion](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/mean%20reversion)
    and the implications for long-term mean reversion and [echo volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/echo%20volatility).'

- en: 'After doing some research, it turns out that this is a very important question.  Specifically,
    there is a strong *inverse* relationship between the magnitude of short-term VIX
    reversion and the continued strength of the longer-term mean reversion trend.  Said
    another way: if the VIX snaps back dramatically in a couple of days, it is more
    likely that echo volatility (VIX aftershocks, if you prefer) will be an important
    factor in the next few weeks.'

- en: 'On the one hand, this should not come as a surprise: if most of the mean reversion
    happens in a couple of days, then less of that same mean-reverting move remains
    for later.  On the other hand, my research suggests that you can use the magnitude
    of the short-term mean reversion move to measure the magnitude of the long-term
    mean reversion with surprising accuracy – at least with the benefit of 20-20 hindsight.  Whether
    the future will mirror the past remains to be seen.'

    from the VIX world to the world of the SPX and the broader markets.  In this arena,
    the data look to be encouraging as well.
