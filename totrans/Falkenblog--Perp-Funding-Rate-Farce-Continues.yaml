    which describes how gold was traded at the Chinese Gold and Silver Exchange Society
    of Hong Kong (CGSE) in the 1980s. This was when trading was not possible around
    the clock, and there was no internet, so a price had little volatility outside
    the trading day. The CGSE was unique because its futures market was undated, i.e.,
    perpetual. The market settled daily and held a 30-minute auction to determine
    the funding rate. Those long gold compare the cost of paying storage and interest
    on the spot vs. the funding rate; those short gold futures take delivery if they
    feel the funding rate is too low. This funding rate was added to the spot price
    to create a new closing price used in the subsequent day’s pnl.

  zh: 因此，看起来互换资金利率和期货基差与永续合约资金费率的相似性是合理的。一般在介绍永续合约时通常会引用两篇学术文章。第一篇是由[Gehr（1988）](https://gwern.net/doc/economics/1988-gehr.pdf)所著，描述了1980年代在香港中国金银交易所（CGSE）交易黄金的情况。那时无法全天候交易，并且没有互联网，所以价格在交易日之外几乎没有波动。CGSE独特之处在于其期货市场是无限期的。市场每天结算并且进行30分钟的拍卖以确定资金费率。做多黄金的人会比较支付存储和利息与现货的费用与资金费率；做空黄金期货的人如果他们认为资金费率太低，就会交割。这个资金费率会加到现货价格上，形成新的收盘价，并用于下一天的损益计算。
- en: The effect on prices and cash flows in the CGSE futures market was as follows.
    If the market price closed at 100.00, and the funding rate was determined to be
    0.01% over the next day, the cost basis for the next day’s PNL is 100.01\. If
    the price stayed constant at 100.00 each day, the longs would lose 0.01 because
    the daily pnl would be 100.00 – 100.01 on a long position, where 100.00 is the
    spot close, and 100.01 is the previous day’s futures close. The traded price would
    never be 100.01; it would just be used in the daily calculation of the trader’s
    pnl on the next trading day.

    proposed a perpetual futures contract for single-family homes. Unlike a stock
    index or a commodity, the underlying asset, housing, is challenging to create
    into a futures commodity because it is not homogeneous like a commodity. Quality
    varies considerably by location and structure, creating a lemons problem. Shiller
    proposed a rental index to create a rental return proxy for a housing price index.
    He proposed a statistical model that correlated with real estate’s average rental
    return, net of depreciation. This rental return would then be paid by the short

  zh: 加密永续合约资金费率最好的解释是内部操纵。当价格为多头永续合约交易者带来巨额利润时，他们并不介意第二天的年化资金费率达到50%，这相当于仅有0.14%的日费用。就像在拉斯维加斯赢得很多钱的人经常给荷官大费一顿一样：使用赌场的钱。2021年2月，相对于受监管且更透明的芝商所（CME），对永续合约的50%资金费率溢价反映了内部人员从受害客户那里获取利益。通常空头的市场制造者收取资金费率风暴，这场游戏被设计成：正面他们赢得很多，反面他们赢得一些。
- en: The theory that explains the positive return/funding-rate correlation is a typical
    story that is clear, simple, and wrong. It makes no sense when you get into the
    details. Like the explanation that price increases come from 'more buyers than
    sellers,' the idea that long demand shows up in futures price premiums has never
    made sense.

  zh: 解释正回报/资金费率相关性的理论是一个典型的故事，它清晰、简单，但是错误的。当涉及到细节时，这一理论就不合理了。就像解释价格上涨是因为'买方多于卖方'一样，认为多头需求表现在期货价格溢价中从来就没有意义。
- en: The perp funding rate reflects insider manipulation of customers, a crypto-crypto
    cost that, if eliminated, would create a superior exchange for those wanting leverage.
    Some of these exchanges are under quasi-regulatory control, which would be a good
    issue for regulators to rectify, as it is indefensible, and there is a lot of
    data out there.

  zh: 永续合约资金费率反映了客户的内部操纵，这是一种加密货币成本，如果消除掉，将为那些想要杠杆的人创建一个更好的交易所。其中一些交易所处于准监管控制之下，这将是监管机构需要纠正的一个良好问题，因为这是不可捍卫的，并且已经有大量的数据存在。
