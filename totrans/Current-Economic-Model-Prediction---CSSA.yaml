- en: As of the 25th of October the Economic Model changed signal from sideways to
    bullish. So far the out of sample predictions since its creation have been quite
    useful for trading during these tricky markets. While Fed day is tomorrow and
    could change market sentiment, the economic numbers continue to show that we are
    not nearing recession territory. This prediction is in contrast to many pessimistic
    news articles that have been published over the last two months. Ultimately news
    articles focus on very recent data and tend to isolate a few specific indicators
    that may no longer have much predictive value (or are context dependent). That
    was the reason for developing an integrated model that uses 50 different indicators
    along with dozens of derivatives of the same time series within a decision-tree
    framework. This model will be featured in real-time on our upcoming website.
