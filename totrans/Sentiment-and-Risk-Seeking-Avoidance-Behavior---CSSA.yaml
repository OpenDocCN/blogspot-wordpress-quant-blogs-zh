    unrelated “anomalies” into one finely woven theory. I introduced “The Optimism
    Hypothesis” in the previous article: [https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2010/01/10/sector-seasonality-and-the-optimism-hypothesis-part-1/](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2010/01/10/sector-seasonality-and-the-optimism-hypothesis-part-1/) 
    as an explanation for why certain sectors and seasons may perform better than others. Here
    is one excellent academic article  brought to my attention by **Abnormal Returns**
    [http://www.abnormalreturns.com/2010/01/tuesday-links-short-suffering/](http://www.abnormalreturns.com/2010/01/tuesday-links-short-suffering/)  “Research
    shows that the returns to **a momentum strategy** is dependent on the state of
    investor sentiment.”  ([*SSRN*](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1479197
    "SSRN.com")). Essentially in this article, the author shows that Consumer Confidence
    is a major driver of relative strength strategy returns. When the consumer is
    optimistic, the winners beat the losers in grand fashion, when the consumer is pessimistic
    the reverse happens. Interestingly enough this helps to explain many of the empirical
    findings of my own research in this area which show that standard relative strength
    strategies perform best once a rally is well underway, and  poorly at extreme
    low points in the market.'

    correlations, and volatility term structure, it becomes readily apparent that
    I am merely using diagnostic tools to measure the risk-seeking/avoidance behavior
    of the masses. Condor Options highlights a few academic studies expanding on sentiment
    measures [http://www.condoroptions.com/index.php/financial-geekery/new-research-sentiment-expectations-and-stat-arb/](http://www.condoroptions.com/index.php/financial-geekery/new-research-sentiment-expectations-and-stat-arb/) Several
    other measures and sentiment-based anomalies are worth noting: It looks as if
    Jeff of Market Rewind has already figured this out and uses  “Sentiment Spreads”–a
    composite score of the number of risky assets outperforming their most comparable
    peers[http://marketrewind.blogspot.com/2010/01/011210-rare-zero-sentiment-reading.html](http://marketrewind.blogspot.com/2010/01/011210-rare-zero-sentiment-reading.html)  as
    a valuable source of confirmation for trends intraday. As mentioned in my previous
    blog, it appears that there are strong seasonal tendencies in risk-seeking behavior
    that are in fact culminated in the form of higher estimate revisions and IPO returns as
    investors look forward to the first quarter of the new year. This tendency as
    well as the January effect probably mirror our own tendency to make New Year’s
    resolutions that are full of  hope and the promise of a fresh start. [http://marketsci.wordpress.com/2010/01/07/marketsci%e2%80%99s-take-on-the-january-effect/](http://marketsci.wordpress.com/2010/01/07/marketsci%e2%80%99s-take-on-the-january-effect/)Perhaps
    in a microcausm this is also responsible for the end of month/first of month effect
    as well. [http://www.tradingtheodds.com/2010/01/how-to-make-millions-in-trading-the-spyder-seasonalities-i/](http://www.tradingtheodds.com/2010/01/how-to-make-millions-in-trading-the-spyder-seasonalities-i/) Further
    confirming this “optimism effect” are the strong seasonal tendencies surrounding
    the holidays and rising optimism prior to Fed days as people “hope” for a handout.
    [http://www.tradingtheodds.com/2010/01/how-to-make-millions-in-trading-the-spyder-%e2%80%93-holiday-effects/](http://www.tradingtheodds.com/2010/01/how-to-make-millions-in-trading-the-spyder-%e2%80%93-holiday-effects/)When
    we look at market breadth– and its positive association with momentum/trend returns,
    again we are witnessing the same phenomenon of unified optimism. Several volume
    measures also seem to confirm the same effect in both directions– on the flip
    side in this study Rob at Quantifiable Edges confirms that low volume with a rising 
    SPY hitting new highs is a form of pessimism that is bad for short-term returns
    [http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2010/01/declining-spy-volume-at-new-highs.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+QuantifiableEdges+%28Quantifiable+Edges%29](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2010/01/declining-spy-volume-at-new-highs.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+QuantifiableEdges+%28Quantifiable+Edges%29).'

- en: In general it appears that risk-seeking behavior is positive across the board
    for most types of feedback dependent strategies such as those that are momentum
    or trend-based.  This holds true only as  long as sentiment is not extreme. The
    same characteristics are true when measuring risk-avoidance behavior– negative
    in the short-term as long as it is not extreme. Many of the “anomalies” mentioned
    in the article (especially the momentum effect) are among the strongest and most
    persistent the market has offered over many decades. Noticeably absent in the
    very top echelon of alpha-generating strategies are the economic and balance sheet
    ratios that are the favorite focus of most insititutional asset management and
    brokerage firms. These areas are arguably the field where comprehensive and rational analysis
    dominates.

    market are driven by the persistency of human beings to behave the same way over
    time and across economic regimes. We are the real constant force in the markets,
    and while its nearly impossible to outsmart eachother in rational times (or rational
    subject areas),we behave like lemming fools at irrational times–long enough to
    be taken advantage of by our more emotionally-balanced brethren.  As human beings
    our collective  moods are like the waves of the sea:  building slowly and reliably
    over long periods of time until reaching peak height in a few short yet powerful moments,
    only to collapse under its own unstable weight.The constant economic/stock market
    patterns of boom and bust will likely always persist until scientists can figure
    out how to change our primitive brains.'
