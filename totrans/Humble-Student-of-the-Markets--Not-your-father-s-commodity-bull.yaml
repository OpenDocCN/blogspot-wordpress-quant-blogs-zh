- en: Some chartists have recently become excited over the commodity outlook. Setting
    aside the headline-driven rise in oil prices, the long-term chart of industrial
    metals like copper looks bullish. Copper is tracing out a cup-and-handle pattern
    breakout that targets strong gains in the years ahead. Moreover, the one-and the
    two-year rate of change, which is designed to look through the effects of the
    COVID Crash, are elevated but not out of line with past bull phases.

    target on a point and figure breakout is an astounding 9.50, which is over a double
    from current prices.

    father's commodity bull market.
