- en: Jens Nordvig recently conducted an unscientific Twitter poll on the FOMC's action
    at the December meeting/ While there was a small plurality leaning towards a "steady
    as she goes" course, there was a significant minority calling for another Operation
    Twist, in which the Fed shifts buying from the short end to the medium and long
    ends of the yield curve.

- en: A few participants indicated that asset purchases could also help guard against
    undesirable upward pressure on longer-term rates that could arise, for example,
    from higher-than-expected Treasury debt issuance. Several participants noted the
    possibility that there may be limits to the amount of additional accommodation
    that could be provided through increases in the Federal Reserve's asset holdings
    in light of the low level of longer-term yields, and they expressed concerns that
    a significant expansion in asset holdings could have unintended consequences.
