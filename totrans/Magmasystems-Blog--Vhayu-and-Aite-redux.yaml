    neutrality in the research and it includes mention of our direct competitors,
    Kx and OneTick as well as our indirect competitors who handle real-time data analysis,
    StreamBase, Apama, Aleri, etc. Sang is going to cover the highlights of the research
    paper during the webcast. That''s where his role ends.*'

    of the lawsuit surrounding Exegy, and that Aleri is well protected from any negative
    outcomes.
