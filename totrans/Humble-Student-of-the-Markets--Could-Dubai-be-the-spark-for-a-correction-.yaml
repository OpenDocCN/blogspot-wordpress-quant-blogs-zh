- en: I indicated that the US Dollar was poised to rally because of excessive bearish
    sentiment. Many market analysts had opined that the stage was set for a USD rally
    but any USD reversal needed a spark such as a geopolitical event.

    of the potential default by Dubai World.

    standstill on the debts of its flagship holding company Dubai World.

    via a bond issue, the proceeds of which traders had rather naively assumed would
    be used to pay back a loan issued by Nakheel, Dubai World’s property arm.

    a debt standstill just hours after raising a bond issue without some disclosure
    in the prospectus document?

    recovery to the despair over a potential sovereign default.
