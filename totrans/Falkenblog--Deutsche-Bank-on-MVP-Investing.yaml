- en: all else equal, the MVP aligns the portfolio in reverse to stock beta. More
    importantly, the MVP which is supposed to be agnostic to expected stock returns
    has revealed itself as a strategy that, all else equal, makes the implicit forecast
    that stocks with higher beta will underperform stocks with lower beta. This, of
    course, flies completely in the face of traditional asset pricing theory. If we
    believe CAPM and think of beta as a proxy for a stock’s expected return then any
    of the characterizations in (3)-(5) imply that the MVP strategy is forming a portfolio
    in reverse direction of the expected return forecasts!

    lily'': they take something good, and make it worse by trying to make it better.
    In the case of the pervese cross sectional results we see: lower return for high
    vol stocks, higher returns for low vol stocks. As usual, they begin by noting
    they do not overfit the problem, in the same way someone says ''while I''m fiscally
    conservative...'', and then decide to load up on the short weighting of really
    high risk companies by setting all their ''residual risks'' to be the same. They
    find this increases the return but does not affect the portfolio risk so much:
    the magic of diversification!'

- en: Shorting highly volatile stocks is a crappy strategy because while it has a
    positive return (ie, the high fliers lose money in a long-only sense), the volatility
    is very high. You simply would have been destroyed in 2009, or 1998-99\. Plus,
    shorting a portfolio is simply very difficult for noninstitutional investors,
    something they do not have a comparative advantage at relative to the institutional
    investors like hedge funds, and a good relation with a short desk. If you aren't
    getting equal access, don't do it, because in asset markets the second tier gets
    severely adversely selected, and you will pay too much, and get 'bought in' at
    the worst times.
