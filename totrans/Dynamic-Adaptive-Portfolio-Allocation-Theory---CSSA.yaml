    practices that i would like to introduce. It is a term that describes the proprietary
    method used to develop investment strategies at CSS Analytics. DAPAT incorporates
    the best concepts from complementary theories and disciplines and integrates them
    in a meaningful way:'

- en: The pillars of modern portfolio theory rest on mean-variance optimization concepts
    introduced by Markowitz. The central usefulness of this theory is in the “free
    lunch” introduced by diversification amongst assets that are not perfectly correlated.
    The goal is to optimize the arithmetic mean relative to the standard deviation.

    This is a statistical measure which maximizes the geometric mean while simultaneously
    being constrained by the probability of going bankrupt being estimated to be zero.
    It is based on win/loss ratios and the estimated percentage of winning hands/
    or trades in the case of investing.

    of position sizing based on volatility and the use of stop losses to reduce risk.
    The importance of these concepts applied to trading, is to show the ability of
    randomly generated strategies to make money comparable, or perhaps even with better
    risk-adjusted results than buy and hold investing.

    designed to learn and adapt from historical data. This can be accomplished even
    if the data is chaotic or non-normal. This allows investment strategies to be
    created entirely by data mining, and also allows existing strategies to survive
    rapidly changing environments. It also permits the processing of tremendous amounts
    of data efficiently and quickly that would be impossible for other methods to
    accomplish.

    methods as a powerful tool to increase the reliability and accuracy of statistical
    modelling and data analysis. It helps us understand the limits of backtesting
    as well as optimization, and prescribes solutions that permit the effective usage
    of these tools.

- en: All five disciplines can be combined by merging their different points of strength
    with their different points of weakneses. A portfolio that employs the principles
    underlying all of these disciplines will survive in the new trading landscape.
    Those that do not, will produce unpredictable and diminishing results over time.

    hopefully i can shed some light on how combining these disciplines will lead to
    far superior results.
