David,
just found your blog through twitter…
How do you derive the COT analysis bullish/bearish bias?

Do you know that Alex Roslin maintains a blog (COTS Timer) dedicated to the analysis of COT numbers. He uses a back-tested system to compare current COT levels to historical levels and derive a bearish or bullish call.

Its not too bad although I am not 100% sure I am sold on the concept of using COT data solely to trade a system since you would be ignoring all the OTC figures…
