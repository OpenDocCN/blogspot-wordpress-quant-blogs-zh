# VIX and More: VIX Expected to Open at 53-54

There are still 25 minutes before the markets open for today, but based on the futures, the day of the week and other factors, it looks like the VIX will break the 50 mark for the first time ever at the open. At this point, I am estimating a VIX in the 53-54 range at the open. This would break the [previous VIX record](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/09/top-five-vix-spikes.html) of 49.53 set during the [Long-Term Capital Management](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Long%20Term%20Capital%20Management) crisis.
