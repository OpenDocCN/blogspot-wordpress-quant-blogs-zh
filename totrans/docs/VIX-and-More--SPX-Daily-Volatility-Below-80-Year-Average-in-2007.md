# VIX and More: SPX Daily Volatility Below 80 Year Average in 2007

Kudos to [Bespoke Investment Group](http://bespokeinvest.typepad.com/) for coming up with yet another interesting graphic, which I have reproduced below.

The graphic shows that the average daily volatility of the SPX was 0.72% in 2007, higher than the low volatility years of 2004-2006, but below the 80 year average of 0.75%.
