# Magmasystems Blog: Wanted : JMX to .Net Bridge

> 来源：[http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2006/11/wanted-jmx-to-net-bridge.html#0001-01-01](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2006/11/wanted-jmx-to-net-bridge.html#0001-01-01)

We need a way for a .Net GUI to speak JMX to a Java server. Anyone come up with anything yet?

Doing a Google search, it looks like we are not the only ones with that need.

Has anyone checked out the

[WS-JMX Connector](https://ws-jmx-connector.dev.java.net/)

?
