## Mining Datasets

[Mining of Massive DataSets](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mining-Massive-Datasets-Anand-Rajaraman/dp/1107015359), although a few years old, offers an interesting [read](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=16YaBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false) on stream-clustering [algorithm](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=16YaBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA257&lpg=PA257&dq=clustering+for+streams+and+parallelism+rajaraman&source=bl&ots=Jfdb_4oRab&sig=yuShpg0jaSXu1KMAQXoik0f5xmY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjdotO3wdLNAhXlCMAKHUeeCG0Q6AEIJDAB#v=onepage&q=clustering%20for%20streams%20and%20parallelism%20rajaraman&f=false).  PDF of the book is available [here](http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/mmds/book.pdf), coupled with a web site from the authors, and [slides](http://mmds.org/) on many chapters.

Following on from the previous blog posting, if you venture down the Bag-Of-Words road of feature engineering, you may then want to begin looking at [clustering](http://mmds.org/mmds/v2.1/ch07-clustering.pdf).
