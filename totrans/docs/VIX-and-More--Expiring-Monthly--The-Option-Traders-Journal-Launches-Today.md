For those who may have missed it, today is the official launch of

[*Expiring Monthly: The Option Traders Journal*](http://www.expiringmonthly.com/)

. This electronic magazine will be published once per month on the Monday immediately following options expiration and is a collaborative effort involving five of the top options bloggers:

In the inaugural issue, one of my contributions is a section called Charting the Market, which includes a half dozen options-related charts and commentary. In a feature article, “The VIX ETNs: VXX and VXZ,” I examine [VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX) in detail. For those who wonder about the nature of the content, the introductory paragraph provides a concise summary:

> *“In the course of my conversations with a broad cross-section of investors, I cannot help but conclude that the popular VIX ETN, VXX, is probably the most misunderstood of all actively traded securities. In this article, I will attempt to look under the hood of VXX, explain how various factors impact the movement of VXX and offer some suggestions about how to approach trading VXX.”*
