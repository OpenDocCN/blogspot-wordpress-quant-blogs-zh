# Magmasystems Blog: Any impressions of the Microsoft FinDev Conference?

> 来源：[http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2007/04/any-impressions-of-microsoft-findev.html#0001-01-01](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2007/04/any-impressions-of-microsoft-findev.html#0001-01-01)

I was on vacation with the family this past week, hiking in Moab (Utah), Ouray (Colorado) and the Great Sand Dunes (Alamosa, Co). Therefore, I sadly missed the Microsoft Financial Developer's Conference.

Anyone care to leave their impressions of the conference?
