Hi folks, the **Super-Charged DV2 (DVSC)** indicator for **TRADESTATION** is currently  available for sale on my new site (currently in beta):

[www.dvindicators.com](http://www.dvindicators.com)

If you are on the email distribution list for [dvindicators@gmail.com](mailto:dvindicators@gmail.com) we will be sending you a bonus code today for your early bird discount of 20%.  Next week, the DVSC will be available as a package with my proprietary volatility indicators and most importantly: **” The Complete DVSC Strategy and Systems Guide”** which gives you a background on how to use the DVSC (and the DV2 etc) to maximize your returns. Also contained are several trading systems that have extremely high winning %  and gains per trade with very low drawdowns. You will also learn how to use filters to generate nearly overa *** 45% annualized return using the DVSC on the SPY and nearly 100% on EEM***.  The systems guide will also be available for individual purchase.

**Starting next week we will be releasing new indicators every few days on the site. I will be introducing many of them on this blog and how to use them. Every indicator that is released will include a mini strategy guide and trading system(s).**  A free package of indicators that contains the DV2, DV Bands, DV Super-smoothed Double Stochastic, and the MMDI (my version of the MACD) will be available on the site shortly.
