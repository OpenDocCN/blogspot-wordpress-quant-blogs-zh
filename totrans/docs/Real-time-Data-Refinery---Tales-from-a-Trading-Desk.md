# Real-time Data Refinery | Tales from a Trading Desk

## Real-time Data Refinery

First, I must give credit to [Hortonworks](http://hortonworks.com/blog/storm-kafka-together-real-time-data-refinery/) for a “Data Refinery” cool data buzzword.  Hortonworks “Storm and Kafka Together: A Real-time Data Refinery” [article](http://hortonworks.com/blog/storm-kafka-together-real-time-data-refinery/) provide a great overview of data process, and why Storm and Kafka work so well together:

> Apache Storm is a distributed real-time computation engine that reliably processes unbounded streams of data. While Storm processes stream data at scale, Apache Kafka processes messages at scale. Kafka is a distributed pub-sub real-time messaging system that provides strong durability and fault tolerance guarantees.

Tutorial available [here](http://hortonworks.com/hadoop-tutorial/ingesting-processing-real-time-events-apache-storm/) to get your hands dirty with Storm and Kafka.

Along similar lines, “Putting Apache Kafka To Use: A Practical Guide to Building a Stream Data Platform”  provides [further](http://www.confluent.io/blog/stream-data-platform-1/) reading material.

Finally, “Real Time Streaming with Apache Storm and Apache Kafka” offers the [classic](http://zdatainc.com/2014/07/real-time-streaming-apache-storm-apache-kafka/) Twitter Stream Sentiment Analysis.
