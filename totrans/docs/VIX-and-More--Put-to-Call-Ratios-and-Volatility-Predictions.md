# VIX and More: Put to Call Ratios and Volatility Predictions

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/08/put-to-call-ratios-and-volatility.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/08/put-to-call-ratios-and-volatility.html#0001-01-01)

Michael at [MarketSci](http://marketsci.wordpress.com/) is out with another provocative post this morning.  Focusing on the CBOE total put to call ratio ([CPC](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/CPC)) data history, he uncovers an interesting relationship between an elevated put to call ratio relative to the 50 day moving average and next day volatility in the S&P 500 index.  In [The Put-to-Call Ratio at Extreme Values](http://marketsci.wordpress.com/2008/08/19/the-put-to-call-ratio-at-extreme-values/), Michael draws the following conclusions:

*“High and low put-to-call ratios…have done a pretty good job at predicting next-day volatility… High PCR levels indicate a bearish sentiment (high level of puts relative to calls purchased) and have been followed by a significant increase in volatility (+29.7%). Low PCR levels indicate a bullish sentiment and have been followed by a significant decrease in volatility (-17.3%).”*

Looking at over a dozen years of data, MarketSci also concludes that the pattern has persisted over time but has been less pronounced over the course of the last two years ([see chart for details](http://marketsci.wordpress.com/2008/08/19/the-put-to-call-ratio-at-extreme-values/)).

I will leave the reader to ponder the implications of having a one day edge in predicting SPX volatility, but given how active SPX and SPY options are, there ought to be quite a few different ways to profit from this type of insight.
