# Executable Specification | Tales from a Trading Desk

> 来源：[https://mdavey.wordpress.com/2013/10/01/executable-specification/#0001-01-01](https://mdavey.wordpress.com/2013/10/01/executable-specification/#0001-01-01)

## Executable Specification

Read the [book](http://specificationbyexample.com/), live the dream – Stories with AC’s that lead to Scenarios

> The [communication](http://dannorth.net/2012/05/31/bdd-is-like-tdd-if/) across all of those stakeholders ( testers, analysts, project and program managers, multiple SMEs covering multiple interrelated domains) to create a single coherent vision

Although old, this [study](http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:347518/FULLTEXT01.pdf) investigates if a non-technical individual can write executable specifications based on domain specific languages.
