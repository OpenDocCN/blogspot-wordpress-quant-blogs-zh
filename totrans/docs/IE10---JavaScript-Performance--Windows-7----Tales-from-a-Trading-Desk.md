# IE10 – JavaScript Performance. Windows 7? | Tales from a Trading Desk

## IE10 – JavaScript Performance. Windows 7?

One can’t help but be impressed by the recent IE blog posting ‘Advances in JavaScript [Performance](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2012/06/13/advances-in-javascript-performance-in-ie10-and-windows-8.aspx) in IE10 and Windows 8″.  However, lets step back for a minute.  In the financial services arena, we have a number of sell-side corps that are only just getting onto Windows 7.  Windows 8 isn’t even on their radar, and possible won’t be.  The remaining sell-side have only just moved to Windows 7, so again Windows 8 is a few years out given the internal upgrade cycles.  So until Microsoft refresh IE10 for Windows 7, IE10 is kind of a dead duck in corp land.

> Internet Explorer [10](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/hh673549(v=vs.85).aspx) is not currently available for Windows 7\. The most recent release for Windows 7 was Internet Explorer 10 Platform Preview Build 2, on June 29, 2011
