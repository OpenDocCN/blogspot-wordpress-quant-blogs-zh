## PerformancePoint Server – Notes

Microsoft was kind enough to give me a walk-though of [PerformancePoint](http://www.b-eye-network.com/view/5610) Server 2007 early last year. PPS 2007 focuses
on delivering three primary missions of planning, monitoring and analytics. One starting place is Norm’s blog that provides details on data integration using [SSIS](http://blogs.msdn.com/normbi/archive/2008/04/04/ssis-and-performancepoint-server-data-integration-demo.aspx). The PP team [blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/performancepoint/) is definitely another place you want to keep an eye on for PP informations. Erika has a [posting](http://blogs.msdn.com/erikaehrli/archive/2007/09/28/performancepoint-server-2007-what-is-it-and-how-can-i-get-started.aspx) to get you started. As expected data for PP is held in SQL Server.
PP has it’s own language to write business rules – PerformancePoint Expression Language (PEL), similar to Multidimensional Expressions (MDX) language.
