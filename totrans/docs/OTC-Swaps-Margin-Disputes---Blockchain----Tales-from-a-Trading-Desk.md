## OTC Swaps Margin Disputes – Blockchain?

The FT has an interesting [article](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/fd054574-23bb-11e5-9c4e-a775d2b173ca.html#axzz3iWpJDhW8) on [collateral](https://www.bnymellon.com/_global-assets/pdf/our-thinking/articles/outsourcing-in-a-brave-new-world.pdf) [utilities](http://www.thetradenews.com/news/Trading___Execution/Industry_issues/Goldman_Sachs_leads_project_to_tackle_collateral_crunch.aspx), “Banks team up to resolve OTC swaps margin disputes”.  Given a [posting](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/block-chain-collateral-innovation-gary-wright) on LinkedIn, “Block Chain collateral innovation”, one wonders if the banks have considered Blockchain technology to solving the problem?
