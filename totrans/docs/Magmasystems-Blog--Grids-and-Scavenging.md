# Magmasystems Blog: Grids and Scavenging

During our meetings

with t

he Windows Compute Cluster Server team last week, it came out that

CCS

does not do any sort of scavenging, nor or their immediate plans to implement it.

Scavenging is an important way to lower the costs of the grid and to gain wider acceptance by letting groups make some money by charging back the use of their spare CPU cycles to the organization. Imagine all of those hundreds of idle

CPUs

gathering dust in a large Disaster Recovery center at an investment bank. I think back to Morgan Stanley's DR center, with hundreds of cubicles of untouched

CPUs

.

Would the

absence

of a scavenging feature eliminate a grid for you?

Does

DataSynapse

or

Digipede

have scavenging?
