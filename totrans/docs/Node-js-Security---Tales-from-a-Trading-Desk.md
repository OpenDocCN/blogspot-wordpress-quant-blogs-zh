## Node.js Security

Although not a research [paper](http://lab.cs.ttu.ee/dl93), this thesis on “Analysis of Node.js platform web application security” is probably worth a read, given the insecure world we live in.  Further reading, although a few months old, see Sven’s Application Security Forum Node.js security [presentation](http://asfws12.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/node_security_presentation_v3_asfws.pdf).
