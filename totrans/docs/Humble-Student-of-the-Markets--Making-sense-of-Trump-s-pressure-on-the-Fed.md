# Humble Student of the Markets: Making sense of Trump's pressure on the Fed

I am somewhat at a loss of why Trump is putting so much pressure on the Federal Reserve. In a recent 

[CNBC interview](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2019/04/01/cea-chair-kevin-hassett-on-the-economy-retirement-stephen-moore-and-more.html)

, CEA chair Kevin Hassett projected that growth would rise again to 3% later this year. “Everything we see right now is teeing us up to have a year like last year - Q1 around 1.5% or 2%, then Q2 goes way north, carries you into a 3% year.”

After the BLS reported a strong than expected March Jobs Report last Friday, Donald Trump repeated his assertion that the Fed should shift to an easier monetary policy (via 

[CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/05/trump-says-economy-would-take-off-like-rocket-ship-if-fed-cut-rates-ends-tightening-policy.html)

):

> President Donald Trump said Friday the U.S. economy would climb like "a rocket ship" if the Federal Reserve cut interest rates.
> 
> Commenting after a strong jobs report for March, Trump said the Fed "really slowed us down" in terms of economic growth, and that "there's no inflation."
> 
> "I think they should drop rates and get rid of quantitative tightening," Trump told reporters, referring to the Fed's policy of selling securities to unwind its balance sheet, a stimulus put in place during the financial crisis. "You would see a rocket ship. Despite that we're doing very well."
