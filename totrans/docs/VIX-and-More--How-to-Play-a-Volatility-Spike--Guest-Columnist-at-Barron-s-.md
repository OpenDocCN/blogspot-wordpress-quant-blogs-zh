# VIX and More: How to Play a Volatility Spike (Guest Columnist at Barron’s)

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2016/11/how-to-play-volatility-spike-guest.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2016/11/how-to-play-volatility-spike-guest.html#0001-01-01)

My thesis in the Barron’s article is fairly simple and should not come as a surprise to those who have been paying attention to what I have been saying in this space over the course of the past decade: 

[VIX spikes](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20spikes)

are typically a gift from the

[mean reversion](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/mean%20reversion)

gods.  The trick, of course, is in the timing of the mean reversion – and perhaps whether to bother to make the distinction between mean reversion and

[median reversion](https://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/median%20reversion)

.

In the chart below, one can see VIX data going back to 1990, with the mean of 19.71 added as a dotted red line.  Even a quick glimpse at the graphic reveals just how difficult it is for an elevated VIX to stay elevated, regardless of the cause.

The Barron’s article talks about some trading opportunities that arise from VIX spikes and includes a

[bull put spread](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/bull%20put%20spread)

trade idea involving

I have remarked on a number of occasions in the past that whenever Steve Sears reaches out to me to pen a guest column, inevitably some invisible market force snaps to attention and arranges for a volatility spike.  Either Steve has some amazing insight into the future of volatility (not unthinkable for a guy who was a driving force behind the creation of the

[ISEE Index](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/ISEE)

) or some other unseen forces are toying with me.  If this happens one more time I am going to start to wonder if I have an obligation to publicly disclose future column requests…

In the meantime, tune out as much of the election hysteria as you can and consider all the gifts from the mean reversion gods that looked too risky to accept at the time.
