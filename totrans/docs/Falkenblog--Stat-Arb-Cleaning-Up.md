# Falkenblog: Stat Arb Cleaning Up

> 来源：[http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2008/09/stat-arb-cleaning-up.html#0001-01-01](http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2008/09/stat-arb-cleaning-up.html#0001-01-01)

Lots of independent corroboration that stat arb is making a lot of money in this tumult. Stat arb is basically trading based on the theme that stocks mean-revert over short horizons, and is based on statistical patterns. When applied to hundreds of stocks simultaneously, it has very low volatility. DE Shaw, Morgan Stanley, and Renaissance, are big players.

Anyway, for everyone selling indiscriminately in panic, their are lots of millionaires in hedge funds saying, 'thanks!' Note the lack of any large hedge fund blowing up in this mess.
