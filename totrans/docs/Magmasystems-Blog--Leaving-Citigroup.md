# Magmasystems Blog: Leaving Citigroup

> 来源：[http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2009/09/leaving-citigroup.html#0001-01-01](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2009/09/leaving-citigroup.html#0001-01-01)

You may have noticed that this blog has been very quiet lately. The reason is because I have resigned from Citigroup (this is most likely the first and only time that I will mention my employer by name on this blog). I will be joining one of the premier names in Capital Markets, helping them bootstrap new businesses, build technology infrastructure, and building great teams.

I am grateful for the opportunities that the people at Citigroup have afforded me over the past three years.

The new company that I am joining is not very permissive of blogging. As a result, my blogging here will be cut back dramatically. I don't want to give anyone any hints about the technologies that we are using or the technologies that we are considering. However, my pursuit of new and interesting technologies to solve business problems will continue.
