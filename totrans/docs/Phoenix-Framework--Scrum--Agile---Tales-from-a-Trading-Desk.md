## Phoenix Framework: Scrum, Agile

Another excellent video from the Going Deep [Channel9](http://channel9.msdn.com/Showpost.aspx?postid=188589) shows. Channel9 Hawk has a good [writeup](http://channel9hawk.wordpress.com/2006/05/03/channel-9-jim-hogg-phoenix-framework-interview-writeup/) of the interview. Does this mean we’ll see improvements in [Visual C++](http://msdn.microsoft.com/visualc/) in the near future?
