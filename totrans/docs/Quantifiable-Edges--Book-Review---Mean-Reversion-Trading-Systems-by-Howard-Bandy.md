# Quantifiable Edges: Book Review - Mean Reversion Trading Systems by Howard Bandy

> 来源：[http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2013/03/book-review-mean-reversion-trading.html#0001-01-01](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2013/03/book-review-mean-reversion-trading.html#0001-01-01)

Howard goes through every step of the systems-building process.  He examines several different oscillators.  He scrutinizes entry & exits techniques.  He discusses risk control.  And on top of it all, he provides code for everything he covers in the book.  It is $50 for the book, which is a ridiculously low price.  There are trading courses that cost many thousands of dollars that don’t provide as much good information as Howard’s “Mean Reversion Trading Systems”.  All of the coding is done in Amibroker, which unfortunately I do not use.  But since he lists it all out, those who use other programs like me can translate it into Tradestation, R, or whatever.  And here is the kicker for anyone that does use Amibroker – Howard has actually set up a web page where book purchasers can download the code at no additional cost.

I commend Howard on his efforts.  If you have an interest in developing your own trading systems, this book is a wonderful resource that I would highly recommend.
