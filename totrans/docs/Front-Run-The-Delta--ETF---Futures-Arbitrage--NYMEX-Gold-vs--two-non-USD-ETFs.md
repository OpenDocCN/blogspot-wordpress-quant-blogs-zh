# Front-Run The Delta: ETF / Futures Arbitrage: NYMEX Gold vs. two non-USD ETFs

> 来源：[https://frontrunthedelta.blogspot.com/2012/06/etf-futures-arbitrage-nymex-gold-vs-two.html#0001-01-01](https://frontrunthedelta.blogspot.com/2012/06/etf-futures-arbitrage-nymex-gold-vs-two.html#0001-01-01)

This study combines the principles of ADR and ETF/Futures arbitrage.  Prior examples of

[ETF/Futures arbitrage](http://frontrunthedelta.blogspot.com/search/label/etf%2Ffutures%20arbitrage)

have only included US-listed futures and US-listed ETFs.  ADR studies on the contrary have included many foreign listed, non-USD denominated assets.  It is the goal of this and future studies to expand on this research by including multiple legs and various competing securities (for instance, comparing cash FX vs. futures FX as a hedging vehicle).

Both ETFs in this case suffer from a significant lack of any meaningful depth in the order book.  The bid/ask spread of each ETF make them prohibitively expensive to trade intraday as well, especially given the volatility of the studied periods.  The markets overlap from 22:45 CST to 05:00 CST, and both studies were recorded June 20, 2012.
