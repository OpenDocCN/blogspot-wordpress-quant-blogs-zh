# VIX and More: Top Submission for Chart of the Week Wins One Free Year of Expiring Monthly

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/02/top-submission-for-chart-of-week-wins.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/02/top-submission-for-chart-of-week-wins.html#0001-01-01)

Since I launched the [chart of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week) feature in November 2008 (I guess it was a quiet month and I had nothing else to do…) I have elected to create most of the graphics myself and pluck a few from out of the public domain.

This week I’d like to try a different approach and get input from readers. To make it more interesting, in addition to publishing a reader submission as the official *VIX and More* chart of the week on Sunday, I will award a free one year subscription to [*Expiring Monthly: The Option Traders Journal*](http://www.expiringmonthly.com/) to the winner.

Readers can submit a chart of the week entry in the comments section of this post or by emailing me directly at bill.luby[at]gmail.com.

I will select one winner in my own idiosyncratic and arbitrary manner, but will give strong preference to graphics that are topical, creative and fresh. Humor (I recall that [Roubini and the VIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/06/roubini-and-vix.html) was a big hit) is also encouraged. In terms of subject matter, I am open to anything that is at least loosely associated with investing and economics. There are no other rules, per se, except that I would ask all submissions to confirm who the author of the material is and be submitted no later than 12:00 noon PST on Sunday, February 28^(th).

As far as the magazine is concerned, the inaugural edition of [*Expiring Monthly: The Option Traders Journal*](http://www.expiringmonthly.com/) will be published on Monday, March 22^(nd), with subsequent editions to follow on each Monday after options expiration. Additionally, the current pre-launch promotion of 20% off the annual subscription price will be available for only three more days. Subscribe at any time through February 28^(th), 2010 and receive one full year of Expiring Monthly at the discounted rate of $79.
