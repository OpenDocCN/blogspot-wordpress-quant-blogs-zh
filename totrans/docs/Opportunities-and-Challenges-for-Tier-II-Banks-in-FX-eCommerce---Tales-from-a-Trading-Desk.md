## Opportunities and Challenges for Tier II Banks in FX eCommerce

smartTrade Technologies and Aite Group recently hosted a [webinar](http://www.smart-trade.net/blog/2013/11/14/smarttrade-invites-you-to-the-webinar-opportunities-and-challenges-for-tier-ii-banks-in-fx-ecommerce/) on the topic of “Opportunities and Challenges for Tier II Banks in FX eCommerce”.  Apart from the interesting data (via [Aite](http://www.aitegroup.com/Reports/ReportDetail.aspx?recordItemID=1077)) on how trade volume has grown over the past decade (MarketFactory offers from BIS data and graphs on its [blog](http://www.marketfactory.com/blog/)), coupled with the trends across FX venues, the webinar (Aite again) provides a number of opportunities that tier II banks could take advantage off:

*   Aggregation services
*   Focus on regional currency pairs
*   Retail FX
*   Value-added services e.g. liquidity analysis, transaction analysis

FX Aggregation comes though strongly (Aite) in the webinar slide deck.  On the topic of build vs buy, Aite data points to a hybrid approach for delivering FX eCommerce as being the most common – unsurprisingly.  smartTrade offers a view on internal crossing and Smart Order Routing (SOR), order management, distribution, analytics, hedging/execution, and [aggregation](http://www.marketfactory.com/aggregator/) –  all features that any FX eCommerce solution should consider.
