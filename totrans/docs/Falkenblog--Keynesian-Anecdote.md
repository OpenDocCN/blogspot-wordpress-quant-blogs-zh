# Falkenblog: Keynesian Anecdote

> 来源：[http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2011/09/keynesian-anecdote.html#0001-01-01](http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2011/09/keynesian-anecdote.html#0001-01-01)

From

[Ron Suskin's book](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/16/us/politics/suskinds-confidence-men-details-recession-dissension.html)

on Obama:

> By the estimates of [Christina Romer's] Council of Economic Advisers, at a cost of $100,000 per job, $100 billion would mean one million new jobs. "A million people is a lot of people."
> 
> Obama was unenthusiastic. Romer, in meeting after meeting, came back with new plans, new ways either to locate $100 billion or pitch it to Congress. Her appeals were passionate. She said they were falling into a "The perfect is the enemy of the good" trap. It's about doing something, anything."

The focus on jobs irrespective of whether they pass a cost-benefit test, highlights the worldview of Keynesians, where spending on

anything

when unemployment is high, is a good thing via the magic of the multiplier. Further, spending $100k per job is good because it's a million jobs. One wonders if there's a price at which it would not be attractive.
