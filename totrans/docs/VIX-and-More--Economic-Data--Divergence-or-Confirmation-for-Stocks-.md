# VIX and More: Economic Data: Divergence or Confirmation for Stocks?

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2012/02/economic-data-divergence-or.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2012/02/economic-data-divergence-or.html#0001-01-01)

The last time I checked in on the performance of U.S. economic data relative to expectations, some two months or so ago, I observed:

> *“One could certainly make the case that data underperformed stocks from April to September, but has been outperforming stocks for the last 2 ½ months.*
> 
> *While conventional wisdom says that stocks lead economic fundamentals for 6-9 months, this graphic does not support that idea. Instead, it will be interesting to see which of the two assumes a leading role now that at least some of the European angst appears to be in the rear view mirror.”*

With the benefit of hindsight, clearly the stocks have been in the driver’s seat and to some extent, the increase in stock prices has had a positive effect on the economic data. For the better part of January, there was a substantial divergence (see dotted red box in graphic below) between stocks and economic data, with stocks in a marked uptrend, while economic data were falling short of consensus expectations on a regular basis.

It is possible that last week’s [nonfarm payroll](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/nonfarm%20payrolls) data and [ISM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/ISM) services index marked a turning point in the performance of economic data relative to expectations, yet it is also clear that the data trend still lags the stock price trend by a significant margin.

For this update, I have annotated the graphic with arrows to show where manufacturing and [employment](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/employment) have been the economic underpinnings of a rise in stocks. This time around the employment data seem to be moving in the right direction, but manufacturing has had trouble living up to expectations – at least for the past two months.
