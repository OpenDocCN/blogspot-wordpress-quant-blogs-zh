## My Microsoft MVP Award

Today I got a nice email from Microsoft telling me I’d received a 2008 Microsoft® [MVP](http://www.mvpaward.com) Award for “extraordinary efforts in Client App Dev technical communities during the past year” 🙂 Thanks Microsoft. Now all I have to do is get to the [2008 MVP Global Summit](https://microsoft.crgevents.com/MVP2008/Register/Login/default.aspx).
