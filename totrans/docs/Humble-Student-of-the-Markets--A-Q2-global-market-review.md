# Humble Student of the Markets: A Q2 global market review

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2023/07/a-q2-global-market-review.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2023/07/a-q2-global-market-review.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models** 

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post, 

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The 

**Trend Asset Allocation Model**

 is an asset allocation model that applies trend-following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity prices. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. The performance and full details of a model portfolio based on the out-of-sample signals of the Trend Model can be found

[here](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/trend-model-report-card/)

.

My inner trader uses a 

**trading model**

, which is a blend of price momentum (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa). Subscribers receive real-time alerts of model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of the email alerts is updated weekly 

[here](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/trading-track-record/)

. The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that began in March 2016 is shown below.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Sell equities (Last changed from “buy” on 26-Mar-2023)*
*   Trend Model signal: Neutral (Last changed from “bullish” on 17-Mar-2023)*
*   Trading model: Neutral (Last changed from “bearish” on 15-Jun-2023)*

** The performance chart and model readings have been delayed by a week out of respect to our paying subscribers.***Update schedule**

: I generally update model readings on my 

[site](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/)

 on weekends. I am also on Twitter at @humblestudent and on Mastodon at @humblestudent@toot.community. Subscribers receive real-time alerts of trading model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of those email alerts is shown

**A global market review** 

Now that the first half of 2023 is in the rear view mirror, let’s review how global equity markets performed. Here are the quick takeaways from a preliminary analysis of relative returns.

*   U.S. equities were the leaders in Q2.
*   Japan is becoming the new stealth leader, while Europe is pulling back.
*   China and other emerging markets were weak on a relative basis.

However, there were more subtle indications if we drill into the details by region.
