# Humble Student of the Markets: Dismounting from the market rodeo

**Mid-week market update**

: I am publishing the mid-week market update early ahead of the FOMC meeting Wednesday, which can create a high degree of volatility.

It has been over a month since the December 24 market bottom, and stock prices have rallied strongly since that bottom. Indeed, price momentum has continued to lift prices even after the Zweig Breadth Thrust buy signal of January 7 (see

).

[Marketwatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/its-time-to-dismount-from-this-stock-market-rodeo-says-morgan-stanleys-wilson-2019-01-28)

reported that Morgan Stanley strategist Mike Wilson thinks it's time to dismount from this stock market rodeo:

> Employing a rodeo metaphor, Wilson on Monday urged his clients to “dismount” as the market’s rally since late 2018 is starting to look precarious.
> 
> “Maybe the bull ride since Dec. 24 has not gone a full ‘8 seconds’ but we’d look to dismount anyway—we’re close enough and bulls can be dangerous animals,” he said in a report, referring to the number of seconds a bull rider is required to stay on to earn a score for a ride...
> 
> “We struggle to see the upside in hanging on just to see how long we can. We think it is better to hop off now and rest up for the next rodeo,” said Wilson.

I would tend to agree. At a minimum, investors and traders face a number of potential landmines this week.

**A Special Announcement**

We told you so. We told you the market was going down.

Here is the track of

***Humble Student of the Markets***

, where we are neither perma-bulls nor perma-bears. Most recently, we have been correctly bullish since the correction of 2015, and turned cautious in August 2018 (see

[Market top ahead? My inner investor turns cautious,](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2018/08/05/major-top-ahead-my-inner-investor-turns-cautious/)

August 5, 2018).

We were also timely at the 2009 bottom. We issued a call to buy beaten up low-priced stocks with high insider buying a week before the ultimate bottom (see

 February 24, 2009).
