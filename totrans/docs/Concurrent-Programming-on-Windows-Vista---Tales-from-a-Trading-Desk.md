# Concurrent Programming on Windows Vista | Tales from a Trading Desk

## Concurrent Programming on Windows Vista

Looks like [Joe’s](http://www.bluebytesoftware.com/blog/Default.aspx) [book](http://safari.adobepress.com/9780321434821?tocview=true) is shaping up nicely. Part III of the book is going to concentrate on algorithms, which possible makes it the most interesting section of the book. Chapter 14 looks good as well – actually the whole book a must read 🙂 Curious to see the [Joins](http://research.microsoft.com/~crusso/joins/) library in the appendix – I’d forgotten it existed 😦 Nice to see NET Framework V4 will be previewed as well – what is the deal with V4 and [“4”](http://blogs.msdn.com/stevemar/archive/2007/10/31/taking-modeling-mainstream-it-s-called-oslo.aspx)?
