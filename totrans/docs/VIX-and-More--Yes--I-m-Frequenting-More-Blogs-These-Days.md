# VIX and More: Yes, I’m Frequenting More Blogs These Days

![](img/6a3f88b81e9d8104658ebb2776874f16.png)I’m sure nobody bothers to pay attention to this, but I periodically tweak the “Blogs I Frequent” section of *VIX and More* whenever a particular whim hits me.  Since I’ve had that set of links up for almost a year, I thought I should clarify what it is and why certain blogs are there.

First, when I began blogging I had no idea what a feed was and I was under the mistaken impression that a blog would be the best way for me to keep track of links to all of my favorite blogs.  That approach worked for awhile, until my news appetite expanded to the point where I needed to scroll down to access all my information source links and the ‘simplicity’ of the approach became too cumbersome for my liking.  Fortunately, necessity birthed not just invention, but some technology test drives as well, and I settled on [Bloglines](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Bloglines) as my favorite tool for managing feeds, as I detailed [back in April](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/04/bloglines-and-information-waterworks.html).

I mention all of this because Bloglines is my primary news aggregation source 99.9% of the time, delivering 242 feeds on a relatively timely basis.  Every once in awhile, Bloglines has technical difficulties and I resort to a backup system.  Usually that backup takes the form of [Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader/), but there are some occasions where I prefer to fall back on the blog.

Now I trade primarily as a result of charts, technical analysis, market sentiment indicators and the like, but I don’t particularly enjoy looking at everyone else’s charts, which is why the list of the blogs I frequent has a disproportionately fundamental and macroeconomic focus and why the sequence (and invisible grouping) might appear chaotic.  Ultimately, my blogroll is a somewhat arbitrary subset of my Bloglines feeds, with preference given to sites that I rarely if ever see on other blogrolls.

For all these reasons, I have recently added three important voices to my blogroll:

Finally, thanks to all who have made *VIX and More* a part of their blogroll or personal reading list during the past year.
