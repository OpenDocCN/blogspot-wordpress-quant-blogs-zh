# Humble Student of the Markets: On the kinds of "conversations"

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2012/12/on-kinds-of-conversations.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2012/12/on-kinds-of-conversations.html#0001-01-01)

[Josh Brown](http://www.thereformedbroker.com/2012/12/14/no-need-for-a-conversation/)

had a great post entitled "No need for a conversation":

> My heart is breaking for the families of those affected by the events in Newtown, Connecticut this morning. Just as I'm sure yours is, regardless of your stance on the gun issue.
> 
> Now, we're going to hear people talk about this sudden need for a "national conversation" or a some grand debate over guns and gun control. I can't think of a more pointless waste of time.

He correctly pointed out that there are entrenched views on both sides of the gun control issue and incidents like the latest mass shooting aren't going to have a significant effect on peoples' attitude. Mrs. Humble Student of the Markets was particularly upset with the news of the shooting, largely because we have a 7th grader and we used to nearby Stamford, Connecticut.

Nevertheless, guns are part of the culture of America. However, look into your own heart and consider how the "national conversation" would change if the shooter had been:

*   Black;
*   An illegal alien from Latin America; or
*   Muslim

Regardless of where you might stand on the issue of gun control, I believe that the allowing the presence of firearms increase the level of systematic personal risk in a society. As the

points out, America is a far more violent society than many other industrialized countries:

**On the nature of risk**

Consider this financial analogy. There are some obvious benefits to financial derivatives. They are useful tools for spreading risk around and an investor can use the leverage inherent in derivatives to better enhance his useful of capital. Now imagine allowing every mom and pop investor to use derivatives such as options, futures and swaps, whether they be listed or OTC, in their portfolios.

Regardless of the benefits or derivatives, do you think that there would be more or less market volatility under such a regime?

: Remember, derivatives don't destroy balance sheets, people destroy balance sheets.
