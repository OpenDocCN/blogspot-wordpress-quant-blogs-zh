# VIX and More: The Correction As Seen in the ETP Landscape

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2014/04/the-correction-as-seen-in-etp-landscape.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2014/04/the-correction-as-seen-in-etp-landscape.html#0001-01-01)

Since stocks bottomed in March 2009, I have periodically been publishing an [SPX pullback table](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2014/02/a-very-middling-pullback-so-far.htmlhttp:/vixandmore.blogspot.com/2013/06/all-about-pullback-from-spx-1687.html) and occasionally a [plot of all those pullbacks and their duration](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2013/04/four-years-of-spx-pullbacks-in-one-plot.html). The recent selloff in stocks, however, has been anything but an SPX pullback. I toyed with the idea of presenting comparable data for the NASDAQ Composite or NASDAQ-100 Index ([NDX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/NDX)), but here again, the selling has been disproportionate in some areas of the NASDAQ universe, even though it has been hit harder than the SPX.

This time around I have opted instead for a chart that shows the peak-to-trough drawdown across the equity ETP universe, focusing on sector groups that I believe are among the most important to watch.

The data above cover only 2014 and indicate the maximum drawdown since the 2014 peak. While many of these maximum drawdowns are from earlier today, there are quite a few instances in which the maximum drawdown was established earlier in the year.

Note that while the NASDAQ gets most of the attention, it is the small caps ([IWM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/IWM)) that have suffered the most among the major market index ETPs.

Not surprisingly, biotechnology ([IBB](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/IBB)), social media ([SOCL](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SOCL)) and Russia ([RSX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/RSX)) have seen the largest declines, but among cyclicals, defensive stocks and European country ETPs, there is very little to choose from.

Finally, just for fun I have added four alternative ETPs with an equity flavor ([SPLV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SPLV), [PBP](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/PBP), [CWB](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/CWB) and [PFF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/PFF)) to show how low volatility, covered call, convertible bond and preferred stock ETPs have fared.
