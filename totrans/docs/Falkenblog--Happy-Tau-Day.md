# Falkenblog: Happy Tau Day

One of the more tragic path dependencies is that years ago someone defined *π* (aka pi) as ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, as opposed to its radius. If you define *τ*(tau)*=2π*, it's like a presbyopic putting on reading glasses for the first time. It turns out, switching from *π* to *τ* makes a lot of other corollaries less convoluted, including the 'world's most beautiful formula' *e^(iπ)=-1*, which would be *e^(iτ)=1*.
