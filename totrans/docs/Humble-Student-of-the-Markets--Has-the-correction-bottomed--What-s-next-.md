**Mid-week market update**: Is the correction over? At least my inner trader had been positioned for market weakness. Subscribers who had been following [my inner trader](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/trading-track-record/), you know that we issued real-time alerts to buy the market on September 12, 2018 and flipped short on September 21, 2018.
