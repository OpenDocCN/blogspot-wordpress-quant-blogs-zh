> 来源：[https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2009/12/09/custom-indicators-with-equity-curves-and-mean-reversiontrend-dashboards/#0001-01-01](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2009/12/09/custom-indicators-with-equity-curves-and-mean-reversiontrend-dashboards/#0001-01-01)

As a side note,  due to many private requests CSS Analytics is now offering customized indicators and dashboards for both Amibroker and Tradestation. Typically this is an institutional solution, but it is now available also to individuals. This involves creating indicators with equity curve monitors and regime filters fully built in, or creating custom indicators or dashboards based on the specs provided. The end result is that you have an easy to use and complete platform to monitor and adjust your trading. Complete support on product use and development is also provided.
