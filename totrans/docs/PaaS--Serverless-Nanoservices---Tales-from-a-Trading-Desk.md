## PaaS: Serverless/Nanoservices

Few articles worth a read on serverless architecture:

*   [OpenWhisk](http://www.informationweek.com/cloud/platform-as-a-service/openwhisk-vies-with-aws-lambda-as-developer-service/d/d-id/1324672) Vies With AWS Lambda As Developer Service
*   Google has quietly [launched](http://venturebeat.com/2016/02/09/google-has-quietly-launched-its-answer-to-aws-lambda/) its answer to AWS Lambda
*   How I decided to use Serverless/[Nanoservices](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-i-decided-use-serverlessnanoservices-architecture-benefield) Architecture with AWS to make CAPI
*   Is “Serverless” architecture just a finely-grained rebranding of [PaaS](http://www.ben-morris.com/is-serverless-architecture-just-a-finely-grained-rebranding-of-paas/)?
