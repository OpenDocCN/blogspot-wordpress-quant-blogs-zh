# Magmasystems Blog: Interviewing Mode

> 来源：[http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2005/09/interviewing-mode.html#0001-01-01](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2005/09/interviewing-mode.html#0001-01-01)

Four people are coming in today to interview for a position on my team. The requirements are heavy C#/WinForms experience, architectural skills, and a small understanding of finance. In my old job, I probably interviewed at least 100 people for 2 similar positions, and we could not get a decent hit. The client ended up hiring a .NET superstar away from one of the Wall Street brokerage houses.

One of the main problems is that recruiters will doctor a candidate's resume so that it appears that they have WinForms experience. So, a typical line on a candidate's resume will read something like this:

*I did an entire web-based .NET application using C# and WinForms.*

With the advent of websites like

, everyone knows the standard .NET questions. I would like to hear what your favorite .NET, C#, and architecture questions are. Feel free to post a comment.
