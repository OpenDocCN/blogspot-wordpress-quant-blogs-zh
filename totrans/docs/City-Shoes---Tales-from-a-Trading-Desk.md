## City Shoes

On the commute home, its the usual Evening Standard read.  Today an interesting article on [shoes](http://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/fashion/great-old-london-cobblers-a-guide-to-the-capitals-finest-footwear-8440610.html).  Jermyn Street is the place.  [Loake’s](http://www.loake.co.uk/) have a nice site, better than [Grenson’s](http://www.grenson.co.uk/en_gb/shop?limit=all) – not sure if that says anything about the shoe’s however.
