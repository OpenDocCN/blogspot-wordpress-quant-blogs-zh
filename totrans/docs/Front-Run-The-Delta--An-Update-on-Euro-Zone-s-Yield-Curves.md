.  Each result was an IMF-backed debt restructuring and a decrease in the value of the USD.

The difference between the current environment and those past is the unprecedented nature of the Euro Zone.  With the inclusion of China and their questionable landing into this whole environment, and the US / Germany / UK with their own debt at record levels, we are watching one of the most spectacular credit unwinds in the history of the world. This era and Bernanke's policies will be some of the most meticulously studied for decades to come.

Here's the current yield curves for Spain, Portugal, Greece, and Italy as of this morning.

All that to say, go
