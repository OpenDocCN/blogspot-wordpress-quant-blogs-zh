# VIX and More: New Blog/Site Recommendation: Index Indicators

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/11/new-blogsite-recommendation-index.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/11/new-blogsite-recommendation-index.html#0001-01-01)

It is rare that I go out of my way to devote an entire post to a particular blog or web site, but in the case of

[IndexIndicators.com](http://www.indexindicators.com/)

this type of attention seems warranted, even though the web site is only in the second week of its life.

First things first, a tip of the hat to

[Headline Charts](http://headlinecharts.blog.com/)

, which is already incorporating some Index Indicators charts into the site's weekly

[Friday Market Sentiment](http://headlinecharts.blog.com/2358050/)

report, which should be a mandatory stop for brushing up on the latest in various market sentiment surveys and related data.

Of particular interest to VIX and More readers will likely be the Index Indicators

[market commentary blog](http://www.indexindicators.com/content/category/market-commentary/)

and the wide variety of charts they provide for breadth indicators, put to call ratio indicators and volatility indicators.

Charts are of the end of day variety, range from three months to three years, and include the following information:

*   Breadth indicators – % of stocks above their 5, 10, 20, 50 and 200 day SMAs; also % of stocks whose 5, 10, 14, and 21 day RSIs are above 70 or below 30

*   Put to call ratio indicators – the 5, 10 and 20 day SMAs for the CBOE equity, index and total put to call ratios

*   Volatility indicators – the 5, 10, 20, 50 and 200 day SMAs for the VIX, VXO and VXN, plus the current level of each of these indices relative to these SMAs (see below for one such chart)

In sum, this new site is an excellent source for data and charts on three subjects that are central to my trading and to the blog as well. For this reason, I have also added IndexIndicators.com to the “VIX & Sentiment Links” in the upper right hand section of the blog.
