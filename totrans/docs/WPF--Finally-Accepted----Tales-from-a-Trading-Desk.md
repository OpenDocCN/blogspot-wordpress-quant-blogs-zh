## WPF: Finally Accepted?

Has WPF finally hit the big time? Josh blogs 10 [reasons](http://www.thejoyofcode.com/10_reasons_you_should_consider_WPF_for_your_next_desktop_application.aspx) to consider WPF and Brad [blogs](http://blogs.msdn.com/brada/archive/2008/01/23/wpf-coming-into-the-mainstream.aspx) a list of 3rd party WPF controls. Josh [blog](http://joshsmithonwpf.wordpress.com/2008/01/23/my-presentation-at-the-wpf-bootcamp/) about his latest presentation, and meets a number of the WPF Microsoft bloggers – one of these days maybe I’ll make it to Redmond and meet Jaime, Rob etc.

*   [Lang.NET 2008](http://langnetsymposium.com/agenda.asp) looks very interesting – particularly Numerical computing with the CLR. Maybe Don’s talk on Modeling and Languages with give us a hit of what he’s working on.
