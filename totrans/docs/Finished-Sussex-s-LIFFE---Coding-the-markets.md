## Finished Sussex’s LIFFE

### January 27, 2011

Sussex discusses the shift from LIFEE to Eurex for the Bund contract towards the end of the book, but doesn’t offer any special insight. There’s a few comments on the Eurex Flipper too, and how he angered locals on Eurex by kidding money out of them. One could argue that the locals were kidding money out of the ‘real’ market participants. Having worked as a local at times, that’s not Sussex’s point of view. All in all, an enjoyable read, albeit without eureka moments.
