# VIX and More: September Expiration Links

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/09/september-expiration-links.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/09/september-expiration-links.html#0001-01-01)

I have been largely out of pocket this week, but thanks to my feed reader have been able to keep on top of market developments.

I was going to skip the almost-weekly [links](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/links) post this week, but once again, there has been so much excellent content lately that it seemed a shame not to share some of it.

Two quick disclaimers:

1.  I give preference to material that focuses on the VIX and volatility, options, market sentiment, and ETFs
2.  While I do not have a bearish bias at the moment, I do find many of the posts with a bearish lean to be more interesting reading
