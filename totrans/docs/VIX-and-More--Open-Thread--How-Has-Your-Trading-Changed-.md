# VIX and More: Open Thread: How Has Your Trading Changed?

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/11/open-thread-how-has-your-trading.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/11/open-thread-how-has-your-trading.html#0001-01-01)

My recent foray into issues of investor [psychology](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/psychology) and [behavioral finance](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/behavioral%20finance) assumes that traders have learned a number of lessons and/or changed the way they trade as the result of the events of the last year or two.

So...in what ways has your trading changed? What lessons have you learned? How are you different as an investor now than you were before the Lehman Brothers fiasco?
