# VIX and More: CNBC Million Dollar Portfolio Challenge: #1227

It was just a matter of time before my string of good fortune came to an end, but for all practical purposes, it probably should not have been today.  Still, at #1227 out of [1,441,536 contestants](http://www.cnbc.com/id/18414028) as of last night, I have managed to hold on to a top 0.1% rating for one more day.

Scrolling back a little, my current position is the result of a 2.8% loss in [Wright Medical Group (WMGI)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=wmgi&hl=en) yesterday, putting an end to a nice run of six straight days of gains of 2% or more.  As I [described earlier](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/04/cnbc-million-dollar-portfolio-challenge_30.html), I had carelessly thought WMGI would report earnings before the market opened or during the day yesterday, but this turned out not to be the case.  Had I held on to WMGI, I would be sitting on what is currently a 6% gain, but instead, I went back to my [earnings spike potential algorithm](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/earnings%20spike%20potential%20algorithm).  This handy tool had helped pick the six consecutive winners and had pointed to a couple of other big movers as well.  Yesterday it spit out [Atheros Communications (ATHR)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=athr&hl=en), currently up 7%, as the top choice.  Between WMGI and ATHR, how could I go wrong?  Well, I got cute and thought I might be able to get even more volatility out of [i2 Technologies (ITWO)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=athr&hl=en), whose dangerous coiled spring cocktail includes a huge beta (over 10 on Yahoo), an equally impressive short position of 13.1 days to cover, and an implied call volatility of 60.  Well, I got the volatility I wanted, but I missed out on the direction, as ITWO is trading down 28% this morning.  It is only a small consolation to know that the algorithm seems to be working…

Depending upon how far I fall down the ranks today, I will make a determination whether I should roll the dice one final time with the likes of [Dendreon (DNDN)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=dndn&hl=en) in hopes of rocketing my way into the finals or just play for a respectable position, such as the top 1%.  I know that this is only play money, but after having come this far, it seems silly to spend it all on one last lottery ticket.
