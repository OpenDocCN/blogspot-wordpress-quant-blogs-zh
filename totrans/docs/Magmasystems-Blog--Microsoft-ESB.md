# Magmasystems Blog: Microsoft ESB

Microsoft in the

[Enterprise Service Bus](http://blogs.msdn.com/mohammadakif/archive/2006/09/17/759414.aspx)

(ESB) space? Ot should be an interesting development to watch, especially for shops who are heavily tied to Tibco RV and EMS. Microsoft will have to really exceed Tibco EMS's performance in order for people to take notice. Also, Microsoft will have to throw the EMS people a bone and support JMS. I might suggest that Microsoft come out with patterns to support synchronous calls over JMS easily.

I can imagine some interesting tie-ins with SQL Server and Excel. You could have database events published on the message bus. You can also have Excel subscribing to the message bus in order to receive real-time stock quotes and position updates, and you can also have Excel publishing risk calculations back out to the bus. If Microsoft were to have this trio (DB, Excel, bus) tied in seamlessly, then this would show Wall Street a real committment.

Are you an RV, EMS, or Sonic shop? What would it take for you to transition to a Microsoft ESB?

By the way .... A few weeks ago, I asked a Microsoft rep about what they are looking at for messaging, and they said that they will be supporting WS-Events. Is this an alternative to JMS for async messaging? What we

**don't**

need is to divide the messaging community at this point.
