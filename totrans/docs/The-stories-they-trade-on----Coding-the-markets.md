## The stories they trade on…

### May 30, 2007

Interesting [post](http://stochastix.wordpress.com/2007/05/25/evaluate-traders-by-their-reasoning/) picking up on a point by [Derman](http://www.ederman.com/new/index.html) about evaluating traders in terms of the stories they trade on. Suspect this would horrify empirically minded traders like [Taleb](http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com) and [Niederhoffer](http://www.dailyspeculations.com). For Taleb, stories are just noise, inductive reasoning straight out of [Mediocristan](http://). And for the Galton influenced Niederhoffer, counting is everything.

If we take a Taleb style epistemological perspective, Derman is putting too much focus on a priori reasoning.
