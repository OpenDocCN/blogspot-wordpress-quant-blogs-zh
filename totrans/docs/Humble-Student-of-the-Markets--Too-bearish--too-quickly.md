I noted that:

My inner trader tells me to wait for the oversold condition to clear up and watch the market reaction for signs of future direction.

Now the

[Technical Take](http://thetechnicaltakedotcom.blogspot.com/2010/02/rydex-market-timers-becoming-more.html)

Get ready for the counter-trend rally.
