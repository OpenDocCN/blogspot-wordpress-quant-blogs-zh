# Microsoft ISU Conference and Heathrow Express | Tales from a Trading Desk

## Microsoft ISU Conference and Heathrow¬†Express

So yesterday I presented at the Microsoft ISU conference. I think the presentation (‚ÄúNext Generation eTrading with Silverlight‚Äù) went overtime somewhat, but at least it generated some interesting questions. Only only real downer about the conference was the fact that it was out at [Terminal 5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Heathrow_Terminal_5), and hence I used the Heathrow Express to get there. Heathrow Express markets that you can stay connected during the journey with [T-Mobile HotSpot](http://www.heathrowexpress.com/Home/Journey/WhatsOnboard); unfortunately I couldn‚Äôt connect during both journeys üò¶
