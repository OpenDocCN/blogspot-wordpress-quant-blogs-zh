# Humble Student of the Markets: Could this be the start of a major bearish episode?

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2023/10/could-this-be-start-of-major-bearish.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2023/10/could-this-be-start-of-major-bearish.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models** 

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post, 

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The 

**Trend Asset Allocation Model**

 is an asset allocation model that applies trend-following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity prices. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. The performance and full details of a model portfolio based on the out-of-sample signals of the Trend Model can be found

[here](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/trend-model-report-card/)

.

My inner trader uses a 

**trading model**

, which is a blend of price momentum (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa). Subscribers receive real-time alerts of model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of the email alerts is updated weekly 

[here](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/trading-track-record/)

. The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that began in March 2016 is shown below.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Buy equities (Last changed from “sell” on 28-Jul-2023)*
*   Trend Model signal: Bullish (Last changed from “neutral” on 28-Jul-2023)*
*   Trading model: Neutral (Last changed from “bullish” on 11-Oct-2023)*

** The performance chart and model readings have been delayed by a week out of respect to our paying subscribers.***Update schedule**

: I generally update model readings on my 

[site](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/)

 on weekends. I am also on X/Twitter at @humblestudent. Subscribers receive real-time alerts of trading model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of those email alerts is shown

#### Oversold markets can become more oversold

This stock market is oversold on a whole host of indicators. Consider, for example, the Zweig Breadth Thrust Indicator. A Zweig Breadth Thrust buy signal occurs when the ZBT Indicator surges from an oversold to overbought condition within 10 trading days. In the last 10 years, there have been four such buy signals (red dotted lines) and numerous oversold conditions (grey lines). 

Here’s what we know. In all cases, the market has been higher 12 months later after a buy signal, though they didn’t always rise in a straight line. In all cases, the market has staged a relief rally when the ZBT Indicator has become oversold, but oversold markets can become more oversold.

A case can be that this is one of those occasions the market could become more oversold and experience a deeper drawdown.
