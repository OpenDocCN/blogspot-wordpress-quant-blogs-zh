I almost showed a bullish study this morning for all the bulls who've been screaming for one. But when an indicator like T21112 hits a new all time high, it deserves a mention.

Spikes anywhere near what we are seeing now have been unsustainable in the past. This would seem to suggest a pullback is likely. (Of course, as the bulls will point out - there have been a lot of things suggesting that lately and the market has ignored most all of them.)

P.S. I also noticed T2112 got a mention from
