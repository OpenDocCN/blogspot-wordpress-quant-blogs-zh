## Google Dart Spark

[Google](http://tech2.in.com/news/web-services/google-releases-stable-chrome-os-update-working-on-new-ide-called-spark/921168) is using Dart to [built](http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57613342-93/google-building-spark-a-web-based-development-tool/) an Chrome app-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE).  Source code for spark is on [GitHub](https://github.com/dart-lang/spark), with widget library available [here](https://github.com/dart-lang/spark/tree/master/widgets).  The Spark name reminded me of the Microsoft Expression Blend code-name, [Sparkle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Blend) – suspect there is no correlation 🙂
