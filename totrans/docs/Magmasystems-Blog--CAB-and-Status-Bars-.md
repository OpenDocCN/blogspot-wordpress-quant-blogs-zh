# Magmasystems Blog: CAB and Status Bars?

> 来源：[http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2006/12/cab-and-status-bars.html#0001-01-01](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2006/12/cab-and-status-bars.html#0001-01-01)

I have not gotten into the Smart Client Factory yet (preferring to learn the underlying CAB framework), so this question might be answered by the SCSF .... but has anyone made a UIExtensionSite for a statusbar object yet?
