# Front-Run The Delta: On Standards

> 来源：[https://frontrunthedelta.blogspot.com/2011/10/on-standards.html#0001-01-01](https://frontrunthedelta.blogspot.com/2011/10/on-standards.html#0001-01-01)

"But you see, I have, let's say, sixty years to live. Most of that time will be spent working. I've chosen the work I want to do. If I find no joy in it, then I'm only condemning myself to sixty years of torture. And I can find the joy only if I do my work in the best way possible to me. But the best is a matter of standards--and I set my own standards. I inherit nothing. I stand at the end of no tradition. I may, perhaps, stand at the beginning of one."

Howard Roark,
