## WinRT: The Future. Are the Win32 API and CLR Now Legacy?

So I guess we need to wait for more information from the Microsoft BUILD conference on the WinRT vs CLR. [Build 2011: HTML5 + JS ‘First-Class Citizens,’ Silverlight Takes a Back Seat](http://www.readwriteweb.com/hack/2011/09/build-2011-html5-js-first-clas.php) offers a few details on WinRT and JavaScript. Does WinRT finally make the Win32 API legacy? Coding to Windows. (WinRT) in JavaScript plays nicely into keeping you in the Microsoft world, but is game over in the cross browser/OS world I suspect?
