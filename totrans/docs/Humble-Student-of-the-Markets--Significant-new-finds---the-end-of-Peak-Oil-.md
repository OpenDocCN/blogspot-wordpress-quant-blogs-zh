The October

[Qwest for Returns](http://www.qwestfunds.com/publications/qwest_newsletter.html)

newsletter that I authored is out. Here is the abstract:

> In this issue we present the case for peak oil, emphasizing that talking about peak oil today is not about how much oil there is in the ground, which we refer to as reserves, but the potential imbalance in oil extractive flows or, said differently, how much you can bring out of the ground at any one time.

**Six Saudi Arabias**

***six Saudi Arabias***

by 2030\. Meanwhile, the emerging market economies continue to grow and their resource demand will skyrocket as they grow. Even if we were to assume that demand stays flat to 2030, the world would need to replace production equivalent to four Saudi Arabias.
