Anyone doing FIX messaging? Need a free FIX engine for .NET? Need source? Then look at

[QuickFix](http://www.quickfixengine.org)

.

*(Looks like the boys from [ThoughtWorks](http://www.thoughtworks.com/) are involved to some degree with QuickFix.)*

If you are involved in FIX or building ECNs, you may be interested in the free

[FIX Journal](http://fixglobal.com/)

. All of the back issues are archives online in PDF format.
