# Humble Student of the Markets: What's next?

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2011/08/whats-next.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2011/08/whats-next.html#0001-01-01)

Despite the

[G7 statement](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-08-07/full-text-g-7-statement-on-renewed-strains-.html)

over the weekend hinting at coordinated intervention:

> We are committed to taking coordinated action where needed, to ensuring liquidity, and to supporting financial market functioning, financial stability and economic growth.

...the markets are behaving badly as I write this. Asian markets are deeply in the red and ES futures are down over 2%. There is no doubt that markets are deeply oversold, but oversold markets can get more oversold.

Here are some signposts that I am watching for from Monday's market action to see if the market has put in a short-term bottom:

*   **Does the decline get arrested in Europe?** Will ECB intervention occur and will that spark a relief rally?
*   **How do the financials behave relative to the market?** European sovereign risk, as well as the fear of a US double-dip recession, are driving this rush to safety and the financials are one of the most vulnerable sectors of the market. Do the financials outperform or underperform the market Monday?
*   **How will the US stock market behave intraday?** The markets will be buffeted, on one hand by panic and forced selling from margin calls and risk managers, and on the other hand by short-sellers covering shorts by the day's end just in case the Fed comes out with a market friendly statement on Tuesday. (See my comments [here](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2011/08/yes-to-qe3-but-not-yet.html) about my assessment of the likelihood of QE3).
*   **How does gold behave?** As I write this, the gold price has screamed upwards in Tokyo and breached the $1700 mark. If this is truly a risk-off "margin clerk" market, then risky assets like gold, silver, copper and other commodity prices should get hit just as hard.

Buckle up. It's going to be a wild ride.
