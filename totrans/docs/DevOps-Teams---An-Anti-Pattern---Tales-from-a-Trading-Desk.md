## DevOps Teams – An Anti-Pattern

Whilst in Sydney I had an interesting discussion around DevOps.  I see DevOps as a skill that sits in a team, not as a separate team.  If DevOps (and similarly QA) are separate teams its an anti-pattern, meaning the team hasn’t understood the concept of “Done”, and have failed to embrace the [culture](http://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/separate-devops-team) of delivery (to production).
