## Chameleon

Still not sure why people are [surprised](http://www.heavy.com/tech/2014/02/chameleon-the-first-contagious-wi-fi-computer-virus/) by virus’s.  The software industry still has a long way to go in developing “safe” software.  Anyway, still an interesting read and piece of research from a UK Uni.
