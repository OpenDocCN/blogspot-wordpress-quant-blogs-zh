# Humble Student of the Markets: Three white soldiers lead the way

**Mid-week market update**: The [“three white soldiers” candlestick pattern](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/three_white_soldiers.asp) is made up of three long white candles, and typically occurs after a falling price trend. It is indicative of strong price momentum after a price reversal. This pattern is evident in the weekly S&P 500 chart shown below.  Usually, the market consolidates sideways after the “three white soldiers”, but the market has continued to advance on the back of the strength of the recent breadth thrust signals. As well, the index faces initial resistance at about 4600, which should be overwhelmed in light of a combination of strong price momentum and the lack of volume resistance (see side bars).

This is a timely gift to all investors and traders who observe U.S. Thanksgiving.
