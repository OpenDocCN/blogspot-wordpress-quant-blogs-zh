## Blockchain: Bonds and Shared Replicated Ledger (SRL)

An interesting read on [bonds](https://medium.com/@3ntry/a-follow-on-from-block-chains-and-the-future-of-audit-b31fe711516a) and SRL by Roger [Willis](https://medium.com/@3ntry/), [Triplentry](http://3ntry.co/).  Probably also worth [reading](http://www.ofnumbers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Permissioned-distributed-ledgers.pdf) “Consensus-as-a-service: a brief report on the emergence of permissioned, distributed ledger systems” which offer some financial use cases in section 7.

Its also interesting to see Ethereum project discussions [discuss](https://forum.ethereum.org/discussion/1746/bond-trading-and-blockchain) “Bond Trading and Blockchain”.  Will also be [interesting](http://marketsmedia.com/corporate-eyes-blockchain-bond-issue/) to keep and eye on [Symbiont](http://symbiont.io/).
