# VIX and More: Can Selling Options Make You a Better Trader?

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/03/can-selling-options-make-you-better.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/03/can-selling-options-make-you-better.html#0001-01-01)

I used to have a list of trading ~~rules~~ guidelines taped to my monitor. The list went through several iterations, but near the top were always reminders that a good trader needs “patience and discipline” to be successful. The list is no longer there, but by now the important ideas have been branded into my psyche.

On a related note, over the course of the past few years I have increasingly gravitated toward trading options. More often than not I find myself selling options, either with or without a directional bias, and enjoying [time decay](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/time%20decay) (theta) work in my favor to increase my portfolio value. Recently, it occurred to me that selling options has made me a better trader because it has cut down on the number of trades I make and enhanced my patience and discipline. How does this happen? Each morning I look at my portfolio and see what my portfolio’s aggregate theta is. This tells me how much money I will make from [time decay](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/time%20decay) alone if the market does nothing and I do not make any trades. As a rule, I try to structure my portfolio so that the aggregate theta is at least as large as my daily profit target. For this reason, I ~~never~~ rarely feel obligated to “make something happen” and force trades that should not be taken.

While there are many approaches to trading, I believe that every trader should be comfortable trading long positions and short positions, buying options and selling options. Better yet, traders should not have a built in bias toward long-only trading or only buying calls. Ideally, a trader should be directionally agnostic and equally comfortable with the full menu of possible trades.

Ultimately, a considerable amount of trading success comes down to the “know thyself” dictum. A trader that understands his or her [personality](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/personality) type, comfort zones and preferences can do a better job of applying the appropriate [psychological approach](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/psychology) to trading. These skills are some of the most difficult for many traders to master. It is quite possible that selling options may provide a shortcut to developing some of those skills.

For more on applying psychology to improve your trading, the best resource on the web is undoubtedly Brett Steenbarger’s [TraderFeed](http://traderfeed.blogspot.com/).
