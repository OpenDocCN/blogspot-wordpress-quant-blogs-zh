# Magmasystems Blog: Random Notes

> 来源：[http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2008/11/random-notes.html#0001-01-01](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2008/11/random-notes.html#0001-01-01)

Two new blogs:

[The News Before The News](http://www.thenewsbeforethenews.com/)[Rodrick Brown](http://rodrickbrown.com/blog/)

Rodrick is one of the few people that mention his ex-employers by name (Lehman and Bank of America), and describes the experiences of working in those places as an Infrastructure Architect for Equities.

[Here](http://www.cs.nyu.edu/%7Emichaels/screencasts/Java_vs_K/Java_vs_K.html)

is a screencast that contrasts Java vs K. I have a resolution that, before I fade away, I will teach myself K. (The creator of the screencast went to Stuyvesant High School. Go Stuy!)

By the way, I hear that Niall Dalton has left Kx Systems. Good luck to Niall, our favorite stunt programmer.
