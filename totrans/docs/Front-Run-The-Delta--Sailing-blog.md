# Front-Run The Delta: Sailing blog

> 来源：[https://frontrunthedelta.blogspot.com/2008/08/sailing-blog.html#0001-01-01](https://frontrunthedelta.blogspot.com/2008/08/sailing-blog.html#0001-01-01)

Just came across an old friend's sailing blog this morning, via Peter Mello's

[Sea-Fever](http://sea-fever.org/)

blog. The new one,

[Sailscape](http://sailscape.blogspot.com/)

, is written by another friend I met through

[ASTA](http://www.sailtraining.org/)

a few years ago.

Looks like I need to get back up to Newport sometime soon.
