Further to my recent post entitled

[China to the rescue](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2011/06/china-to-rescue.html)

[Bloomberg](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-06-25/china-to-buy-hungarian-debt-as-wen-extends-support-to-european-finances.html)

reported that Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao stated that China will continue to buy European sovereign debt, including Hungarian government bonds, and support the euro:

> China pledged to buy Hungarian government bonds and said it will “consistently” support the euro as Europe battles to fight its way out of a sovereign debt crisis.
> 
> China will buy a “certain amount” of Hungarian government bonds and remains a “long-term investor” in European debt markets, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said in Budapest today. This afternoon, Wen travels to the U.K. and then on to Germany on his three-country European tour.
> 
> “China is a long term investor in Europe’s sovereign debt market,” Wen said in translated comments at a press conference with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. “In recent years we have increased by quite a big margin our holdings of government bonds. We will consistently continue to support Europe and the euro.”

Whether the "certain amount" is a token amount or the sign of significant commitment, it's impossible to know. Nevertheless, this is a glimmer of hope for the bulls in a world that is increasingly tilting bearish.
