# Quantifiable Edges: VXO Is Suggesting An Immediate Pullback - Or None At All

Thursday we again saw the VIX and VXO close well below their recent mean.  Such stretches suggest a collapse in fear among investors.  The study below was last seen in the 10/21/13 subscriber letter. It looks for stretches of 15% or more that have persisted for three days.

Based on the stats table there appears to be a downside inclination. I find the note at the bottom of the study to be especially interesting. Nearly every case has experienced an almost immediate pullback, but those that didn't went without pulling back for a long time.
