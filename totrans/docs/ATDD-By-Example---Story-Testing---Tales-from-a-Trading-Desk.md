## ATDD By Example – Story Testing

Had a quick read of Markus Gartner’s ATDD By Example [book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/ATDD-Example-Test-driven-Development-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321784154) recently.  The role play dialogue should aid non-story testing people to get into the story testing mentality. Concur on the common language (page 48), the ubiquitous language for a project.  Unit tests are still needed, especially in the case of glue code (page 119).  Power of Three (page 153), offer sense on why ensuring testers are included from day 1 of a project is important.
