# VIX and More: Pairs Trading with ROB

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/08/pairs-trading-with-rob.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/08/pairs-trading-with-rob.html#0001-01-01)

While I have never written down any sort of mission statement or goals for *VIX and More*, my aim here has always been to bring fresh ideas, new subject matter and original graphics to an investment landscape that I find all too often overrun by the same warmed over sound bites and clichés.

Ideally, I would like to give readers a steady diet of ideas and concepts they can ruminate about and use to incorporate new thinking into their trading.

I have never been keen on trading blogs, but there are times when I should probably make a better effort to build a bridge from ruminations to trading. Yesterday’s [Hermès vs. Wal-Mart](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/08/hermes-vs-wal-mart.html) is a case in point. The post generated a fair amount of feedback, including some discussion about possible pairs trading approaches for some retailing ETFs and individual stocks.

The chart below is an adaptation of the Claymore/Robb Report Global Luxury Index ETF ([ROB](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/ROB)) to Wal-Mart ([WMT](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/WMT)) ratio discussed in yesterday’s post and incorporates some [pairs trading](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/pairs%20trading) tools found in [ETF Rewind](http://etfrewind.blogspot.com/), a powerful Excel spreadsheet tool and companion blog that is a sister site to Jeff Pietsch’s popular [Market Rewind](http://marketrewind.blogspot.com/) blog.

The chart shows the potential for a market neutral pairs trading approach using ROB and WMT that incorporates a 4 day lookback period and results in a nice smooth hypothetical profit and loss curve.
