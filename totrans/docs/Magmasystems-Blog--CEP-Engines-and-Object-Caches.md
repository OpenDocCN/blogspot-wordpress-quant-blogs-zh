# Magmasystems Blog: CEP Engines and Object Caches

> 来源：[http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2008/02/cep-engines-and-object-caches.html#0001-01-01](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2008/02/cep-engines-and-object-caches.html#0001-01-01)

I am curious if any of the CEP vendors have support for getting data from distributed object caches. It is easy to feed data into a CEP engine through JMS (Tibco EMS), sockets, flat files, standard databases (SS, Sybase, Oracle, DB2). But, has anyone integrated an object cache like Gemfire, Tangasol, and Gigaspaces with any CEP engine?

I also notice that Gemfire RTE claims to have CEP capabilities.
