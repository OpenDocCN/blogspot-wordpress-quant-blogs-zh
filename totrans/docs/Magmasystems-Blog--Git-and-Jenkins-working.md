# Magmasystems Blog: Git and Jenkins working

> 来源：[http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2011/08/git-and-jenkins-working.html#0001-01-01](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2011/08/git-and-jenkins-working.html#0001-01-01)

This blog post helped me get running with Git and Jenkins:

[http://www.xairon.net/2011/03/jenkins-and-github-continuous-integration/](http://www.xairon.net/2011/03/jenkins-and-github-continuous-integration/)

The key was finding the Plugins Management page within the local Jenkins monitoring page.

So, my build environment is now set up, and consists of

*   Eclipse Helios (IDE)
*   Maven (Build and dependencies)
*   Git (Source control)
*   Jenkins (Continuous Integration)

Next step is to install JUnit and write a few unit tests.
