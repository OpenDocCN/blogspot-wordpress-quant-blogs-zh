## Puzzles of finance

### May 31, 2006

Mark Kritzman's [Puzzles of Finance](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0471228842) is a model of clarity and insight. The glossary and primer on financial concepts and quantitative methods is worth the price of admission on its own. There's a wonderfully clear explanation of compounding, and the relationship between frequency and e, the natural log base.
