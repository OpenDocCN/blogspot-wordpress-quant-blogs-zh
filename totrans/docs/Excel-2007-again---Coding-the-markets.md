## Excel 2007 again

### July 28, 2006

A couple of emails with [Paul](http://www.microsoft.com/uk/msdn/team/Paul_Foster.mspx) have reassured me that live pricing sheets driven by real time market data and hosted by Excel services will be possible. The solution is to code an RTD server that uses Excel’s web services API to kick off a recalc that will pull in the new data. Hope the managed code required by Excel Services doesn’t introduce too much latency.

And in other news, congrats to [Marc](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com) on his [new gig](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2006/07/start-of-new-adventure.html)!
