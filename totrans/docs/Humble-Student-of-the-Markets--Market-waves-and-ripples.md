# Humble Student of the Markets: Market waves and ripples

**Mid-week market update**

: Charles Dow once characterized the stock market`s price movement as being composed of tides, waves, and ripples. We can see a mini version of this thesis by the market's action in the past week. The major indices had staged an upside breakout through a downtrend and sentiment had turned bullish.

This week, the narrative became more cautious:

*   10-year bond yields had spiked significantly above 3%.
*   The US-North Korea summit is at risk of going off the rails.
*   The anti-migrant Lega Nord and anti-establishment Five Star Movement are on the verge of forming the next Italian government.
*   The Sino-American trade talks are undergoing their own roller coaster. Trump's [weekend "rescue ZTE" tweet](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/995680316458262533) was followed by a [White House clarification](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/press-briefing-principal-deputy-press-secretary-raj-shah-051418/) that walked back some of rhetoric.

Which is the wave? Which is the ripple?
