# Magmasystems Blog: It's the Models, Stupid

> 来源：[http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2007/08/its-models-stupid.html#0001-01-01](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2007/08/its-models-stupid.html#0001-01-01)

I just can't think that, in the world that we deal with, our efforts spent on low-latency, code optimization, high throughput, best algo containers, etc ... are worthless if the models are not good.

Doesn't matter how fast you get your trades out to the exchanges if you are always on the wrong side of the trade.
