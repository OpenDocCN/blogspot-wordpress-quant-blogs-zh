# Server-Sent Events | Tales from a Trading Desk

## Server-Sent Events

Interesting [read](https://segment.io/blog/2014-04-03-server-sent-events-the-simplest-realtime-browser-spec/) over on Segments.io regards Server-Sent events.  Main take away appears to be that if you don’t need full 2 way communications aka WebSockets, then Server-Sent events maybe the way to go.  Anyone used Server-Sent events for a web trading application?
