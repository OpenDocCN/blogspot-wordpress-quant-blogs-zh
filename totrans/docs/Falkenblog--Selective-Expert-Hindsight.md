# Falkenblog: Selective Expert Hindsight

Stiglitz is a sad person. He chooses to live in the world of rhetoric over the one of reason.

He no longer is relevant in the public discourse.

But some believe he is "The Most Misunderstood Man in America".

Comedy gold, Teresa. I think it's obvious Stiglitz doesn't have the temperament to work on a team that actually wants to get something done.

Yes, unlike the Reagan Administration that had Larry Kudlow as Chief Economist at the OMB.

No wonder budgets were balanced.

Maybe we should call him The Lone Gunman of Econ.
