# VIX and More: VIX Price Channel Chart

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/03/vix-price-channel-chart.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/03/vix-price-channel-chart.html#0001-01-01)

Today I am concluding my presentation of some of the charts I received as entries in last week’s [chart of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week) contest.

The chart below comes from Dan Glynn, who offered the following commentary:

> *“This is just a simple one year chart of the VIX in a price channel with MACD and stochastic indicators. Every time the VIX has broken the price channel lower line (highlighted) there has been a reversal, even in this lengthy downtrend. In addition, I have white arrows pointing from where the stochastic lines were crossing. This either coincided with the channel break or was slightly before or after. I also red boxed the most recent MACD bars, which are getting shorter. [Finally,] the distance between the last price line break and the most recent shows the most X-axis (vertical) distance [of] any other consecutive price line breaks throughout the year.”*

The original version of the chart, which is larger and easier to read, can be found [here](http://content.screencast.com/users/orth1/folders/Default/media/2b7ea4cd-fce7-496b-8e44-28ec2eca1f0f/2010-02-28_1903.png).

Thanks again to all who sent in charts. This was a lot of fun for me and I will definitely do it again.
