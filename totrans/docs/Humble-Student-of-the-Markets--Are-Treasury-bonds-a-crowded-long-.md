# Humble Student of the Markets: Are Treasury bonds a crowded long?

How crowded is the long Treasury trade? Anecdotal evidence suggests that the trade is becoming a crowded long.

We discussed the best way to preserve capital in such a calamitous environment. The conclusion was to load up on the US dollar and US Treasury bonds, the scenario that seems to be working so far this week.

**What does the data show?**

Let's go to the data. Global Macro Monitor showed this chart of who is funding the US deficit. While the latest data shows that there are certain a lot of fund flows into US Treasuries from domestic and international investors, levels are similar to levels seen in 1Q 2010 and below the panic levels seen in the 3Q and 4Q of 2008.

What about hedge funds? These charts from Mary Ann Bartels of BoA/Merrill Lynch shows that large speculators, or hedge funds, are nowhere near a crowded long in the long bond.

What about the 10-year note? This chart shows that while large speculators have been buying the 10-year note, they are also nowhere near a crowded long.

This chart below shows the relative performance of the 30-year Treasury ETF against SPY. Again, it shows that while long bond returns are somewhat stretched relative to equities, relative performance levels are similar to the levels seen during the Summer of 2010 and far below the end-of-the-world levels of the Lehman Crisis.

Conclusion: While investors may be rushing into US Treasuries, the safety trade is nowhere near a crowded long, which indicates that risk-off trade has more room run.
