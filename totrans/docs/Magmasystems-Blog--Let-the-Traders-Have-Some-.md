# Magmasystems Blog: Let the Traders Have Some!

In the good old days, when I was designing trader workstations for Goldman and Drexel Burnham, we use to have close interaction with the traders themselves. We were in an Extreme Programming mode by necessity. Traders were giving us constanmt feedback, and we were able to stand over their shoulders while they traded so we could see how they interacted with the data.

Nowadays, the development staff is usually isolated from the traders... we get our specs from the Business Analysts. Not only that... you often get screen layouts from the BAs too! This often results in Windows apps that look like the old CICS screens... miles and miles of edit and comboboxes, modal interactions, etc. The traders don't mind... they are used to spending a good portion of their days in Excel, or they are used to the austere look of a Bloomberg terminal.

UI design has advanced over the past few years. Let the developers stand over a trader for a while. Let us see how they put a trade together. Let us try to make things easier for them.
