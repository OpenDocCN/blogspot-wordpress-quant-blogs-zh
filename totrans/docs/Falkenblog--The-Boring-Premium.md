Todd Mitton and Keith Vorkink from (boring) BYU published

[Why Do Firms With Diversiﬁcation Discounts Have Higher Expected Returns?](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=AC2371ACFE972A96F224D46D150B6311.journals?fromPage=online&aid=7982091)

Their answer: no skew. People will pay up for lottery tickets, but if you take those dreams away, it becomes an asset that is neglected. They find diversified firms offers less skew, and diversiﬁcation discounts are signiﬁcantly greater when the diversiﬁed ﬁrm offers less skewness than typical focused ﬁrms in similar business segments. They suggest a substantial proportion of the excess returns received on discount ﬁrms relative to premium ﬁrms can be explained by differences in exposure to skewness.

The implication is clear: people pay a premium for volatile stocks that have stories and potential. Conditional upon playing in a risky game, such as equities, there's not a return premium for risk, there's a premium for boring.
