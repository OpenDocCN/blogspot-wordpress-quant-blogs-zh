## Mappers, packers & toxoplasma

### June 9, 2010

I loved Alan Carter’s [Programmer’s Stone](http://the-programmers-stone.com/the-original-talks/) when I first read it in the late 90s, the mapper/packer distinction really hit the nail on the head. When he went on to [diagnose the roots](http://www.the-programmers-stone.com/about) of that behavioural distinction as [dopamine driven ritual stress addiction](http://the-programmers-stone.com/about/neuroscience/) I heard a lot of echoes of the mindless proceduralism that I see in investment bank IT departments.

Reading this [article on toxoplasma](http://www.economist.com/sciencetechnology/displaystory.cfm?story_id=16271339) and how it’s been empirically determined to reduce novelty seeking behaviour, and increase neurotic behaviour reminded me of Alan’s work. I wonder if he’s aware of toxoplasma as a candidate cause of stress addiction ?
