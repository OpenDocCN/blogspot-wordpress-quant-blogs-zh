# VIX and More: Portfolio A1 Reshuffles Holdings for Holidays

Portfolio A1 continued its strong performance last week, with cumulative gains of 18.9% since the portfolio’s February 16^(th) inception – 16.9% better than the 2.0% return of the benchmark S&P 500 index during this period.

Notwithstanding the excellent recent run, this high turnover portfolio continues to seek out better opportunities and therefore dropped [DryShips (DRYS)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=drys) and [Fresh Del Monte Produce (FDP)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=fdp), replacing them with Norwegian energy and aluminum giant [Norsk Hydro (NHYDY)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=nhydy), as well as [The Pepsi Bottling Group (PBG)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=pbg), a Pepsi subsidiary.  I find the Pepsi move a little surprising, especially since the portfolio had already experimented with [PepsiAmericas (PAS)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=pas) in November.  How can a computer program have an affinity for a particular brand…?

There are no additional changes to the portfolio this week.

A snapshot of the portfolio is as follows:
