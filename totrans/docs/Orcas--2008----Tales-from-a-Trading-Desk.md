# Orcas: 2008? | Tales from a Trading Desk

> 来源：[https://mdavey.wordpress.com/2007/04/18/orcas-2008/#0001-01-01](https://mdavey.wordpress.com/2007/04/18/orcas-2008/#0001-01-01)

## Orcas: 2008?

Looks like Orcas is [planned](http://www.winbeta.org/comments.php?shownews=6936) for this year, but as with any Microsoft product, it could slip 😦  Orcas is viewed by some banks as the date at which they will push into the WPF world.  Any slippage on the Orcas release could therefore be expensive in terms of external client applications – where a [“great business experience”](https://mdavey.wordpress.com/2007/04/17/wpf-enabling-technology/) is a necessity.

Off topic, its nice to see a low price point for the DX10 GPU’s from [NVIDIA](http://www.nvidia.com/object/IO_41448.html). Hopefully, [Dell](http://www.dell.com) will get them into their notebooks soon.
