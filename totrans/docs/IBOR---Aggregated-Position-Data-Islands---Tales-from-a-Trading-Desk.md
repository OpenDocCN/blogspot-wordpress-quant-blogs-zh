## IBOR – Aggregated Position Data Islands

Much has been written about IBOR’s (Investment Book of Record) over the last 6+ months.  Possibly one of the reasons IBOR has gained tractors in some quarters of the asset management space is due to some investment bankers migrating between the industry silo’s and bringing ideas and thoughts front the investment banking arena.  Likewise, regulations, risk compliance, pre-trade compliance and more are having an effected on the need for data to aid decision making.  MoneyMate offers some thoughts on the IBOR [buzz](http://blog.moneymate.com/2013/10/22/ibor-the-next-great-hype/).  SimCorp clearly has a lot to [say](http://www.eventsimcorpwe.be/sites/default/files/files/MAS_Vision%20and%20Roadmap.pdf) in this space.  Sapient offers its [view](http://www.sapient.com/content/dam/sapient/sapientglobalmarkets/pdf/thought-leadership/IBOR_WP_final.pdf) – Single Source of Truth.

More interestingly, M&G have [provided](http://www.pentagonconsulting.com/downloads/m&g_ibor_genericreqs.pdf) a generic IBOR requirements and product definition document to the IBOR Standards Group.  WatersTechnology appears to be running an IBOR [event](http://events.waterstechnology.com/bbiborlondon/static/agenda-2013) in December 2013 that maybe of interest.
