What's funny is the status hierarchies for economists and rappers are real, in that people really do care alot about their ingroup ranking in a specialized field, and view other status hierarchies as kind of a joke. That rappers are not making jokes about economists highlights the fact that the rapper hierarchy is far bigger, and its easier for economists to empathize with rappers than vice versa.
