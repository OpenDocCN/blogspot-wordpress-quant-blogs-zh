# Quantifiable Edges: Welcome ETF Prophet

> 来源：[http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2010/07/welcome-etf-prophet.html#0001-01-01](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2010/07/welcome-etf-prophet.html#0001-01-01)

I'll have a post ready in about an hour, but I just wanted to quickly point people to a new site that looks promising - ETF Prophet.

[http://etfprophet.com/](http://etfprophet.com/)

It is the work of a few bloggers who I've admired for some time including Jeff Pietsch of Market Rewind and Bob Barnes of BZBTrader. In all they have a total of 7 contributors, some experienced and some new to writing. I'm familiar with 5 of the 7 contributors and suspect ETFProphet will fast become a place where readers can find some thought provoking original thinking. I'm looking forward to following them.
