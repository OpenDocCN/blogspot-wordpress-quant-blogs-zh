## Anyone Seen a HP TouchSmart on the Trading Floor?

As a colleague reminded me today, the [HP TouchSmart](http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/uk/en/ho/WF02a/12454-12454-3352963.html) is a lot more interesting on the trading floor than a Microsoft Surface! FX [Click to Deal](http://www.studyforex.com/click-and-deal-trading.html) could benefit.
