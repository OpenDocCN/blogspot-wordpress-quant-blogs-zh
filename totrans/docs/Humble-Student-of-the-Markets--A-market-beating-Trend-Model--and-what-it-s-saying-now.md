# Humble Student of the Markets: A market beating Trend Model, and what it's saying now

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2019/10/a-market-beating-trend-model-and-what.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2019/10/a-market-beating-trend-model-and-what.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models**

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post,

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The

**Trend Model**

is an asset allocation model which applies trend following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or contraction (bearish)?"

My inner trader uses a

**trading model**

, which is a blend of price momentum (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa). Subscribers receive real-time alerts of model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of the those email alerts are updated weekly

. The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that began in March 2016 is shown below.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Buy equities*
*   Trend Model signal: Bearish*
*   Trading model: Neutral*

**A Trend Model update**

Let me start by wishing all of my Canadian friends a Happy Thanksgiving weekend.

A post last week (see

[A 5+ year report card of our asset allocation Trend Model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2019/10/08/a-5-year-report-card-of-our-asset-allocation-trend-model/)

) brought forth a number of questions, and some new subscribers. To briefly recap that post, I have been publishing the signals of my Trend Model since 2013\. A simulated portfolio which varied the equity allocation based on those out-of-sample signals significantly beat a passive 60/40 benchmark, and on a consistent basis. In particular, the simulated portfolio was able to cushion some of the drawdowns during bearish equity episodes. The study was a proof of concept that the Trend Model can add value to an asset allocation process.

This week, we answer the following questions:

*   What is the basis for the Trend Model
*   What is it saying now?
*   How does it react to news like the US-China preliminary agreement?
