# Magmasystems Blog: HP Notebook Crack - Part 2

> 来源：[http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2009/05/hp-notebook-crack-part-2.html#0001-01-01](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2009/05/hp-notebook-crack-part-2.html#0001-01-01)

The original HP case worker never called me back during the 24 to 72 hour time period that they promised.

After calling back again and going through two more levels of the "gatekeepers", I was transferred to India and assigned a new case worker, who promptly informed me that HP had not yet determined if my laptop fell into the same category as the other 200 models of HP laptops that had the hinge crack problems.

I ended up ordering a new front bezel and some other spare parts from the HP website. I will try to do the repairs myself.

The hinge crack issue, combined with the fact that I have an unbearably noisy fan (with no easy access), makes me think that I will never purchase an HP Laptop again.

I may go back to Dell after a hiatus of several years. The Dell laptops that I have had have been built like tanks.
