# AWS Scale | Tales from a Trading Desk

> 来源：[https://mdavey.wordpress.com/2015/01/21/aws-scale/#0001-01-01](https://mdavey.wordpress.com/2015/01/21/aws-scale/#0001-01-01)

## AWS Scale

High Scalability has an interesting article on [Amazon](http://highscalability.com/blog/2015/1/12/the-stunning-scale-of-aws-and-what-it-means-for-the-future-o.html), “The Stunning Scale Of AWS And What It Means For The Future Of The Cloud”, coupled with an older [article](http://highscalability.com/amazon-architecture), “Amazon Architecture”.  Both offer some great insight into [AWS](http://www.enterprisetech.com/2014/11/14/rare-peek-massive-scale-aws/).  Although both articles, including the more recent article is packed full of interesting information, its worth calling out a few points:

*   “Testability. Their gear was better because they tested it better. Enterprise gear is hard to test at scale. They created a $40 million test bed of 8000 servers (3 megawatts). “
*   “AZs are less than 2ms apart and usually less than 1ms apart. From a latency perspective they are fairly close, within a few kilometers. Far enough apart for safety, close enough for good latency.”
*   “AZs are milliseconds apart so you can commit to both at the same time.”

Very cool stuff.  Make some of the corporate infrastructure discussion over the years look weak and fact-less
