A Thoughtworker who is with my group was saddened to find out that, for some reason, Google Code is blocked by our corporate firewall. I suggested that, in addition to the usual suspects, he check out the software at

[TopCoder.com](http://software.topcoder.com)

.

There are more components and apps written for Java, but the .NEt world is well represented on that site.

I have also heard that some of the financial companies are starting to recruit from TopCoder. It's a good way of examining a candidates coding technique and architectural insight. It's a better way of screening a candidate, rather than going through the same old "Describe Polymorphism to Me" questions.
