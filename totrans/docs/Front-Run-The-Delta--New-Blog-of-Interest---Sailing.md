# Front-Run The Delta: New Blog of Interest - Sailing

> 来源：[https://frontrunthedelta.blogspot.com/2007/11/new-blog-of-interest-sailing.html#0001-01-01](https://frontrunthedelta.blogspot.com/2007/11/new-blog-of-interest-sailing.html#0001-01-01)

[Sea-Fever Blog](http://sea-fever.org/)

is an interesting read if you're into sailing at all. It's updated by Peter A. Mello, whom I met through the

[American Sail Training Association](http://tallships.sailtraining.org/)

several years ago.

> The Sea-Fever blog is a work in progress that will cover subjects that interest me, professionally and personally. Topics will include maritime heritage and cultural initiatives, corporate social responsibility, Leaders and leadership, nonprofit management and communications, new media, web 2.0, sailing and whatever else I feel might be worth sharing.

Worth a look.
