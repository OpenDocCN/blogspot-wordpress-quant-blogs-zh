# Humble Student of the Markets: Economic storm clouds still gathering

With headlines like

[Buffett: Economy in a recession, will be worse than feared](http://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/2008-04-28-buffett-recession_N.htm)

and

[McCain & Clinton Fail Economics 101](http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2008/05/high-oil-prices.html)

, I thought that it is time to focus on the possible effects of the November presidential elections.

**Clinton or Obama presidency = Double dip?** 

With the US fiscal situation as it is today, a Democrat in the White House, regardless of whether it is Clinton or Obama, would likely raise taxes to try to bring the budget more into balance. Can you say

***double dip recession***

?

It’s usually in the first two years a new administration will try to take its economic medicine and blame it on the previous president. Remember how the current Bush administration tried to position the post-Tech Bubble slowdown as the “Clinton recession”?

**McCain presidency = ???**

When John McCain was

[quoted](http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110007600)

in 2005 as “I'm going to be honest: I know a lot less about economics than I do about military and foreign policy issues. I still need to be educated” in that bastion of left wing politics, the Wall Street Journal, the country could be rudderless economically.

A more recent

shows that he still has no economic direction: “The issue of economics is not something I’ve understood as well as I should. I’ve got Greenspan’s book.”
