Victor Niederhoffer mentions something interesting in his [blog](http://www.dailyspeculations.com/wordpress/?p=2297), looking at the weekly differentials in price movement on the complex plane, with the angles and magnitude as a predictor. I can see that a more obtuse angle indicates a bigger swing in the lows and highs. At least an interesting way to visualize these relationships.
