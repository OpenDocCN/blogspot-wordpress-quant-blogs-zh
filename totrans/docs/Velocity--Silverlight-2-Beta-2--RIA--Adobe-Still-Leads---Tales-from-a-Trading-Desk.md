## Velocity, Silverlight 2 Beta 2, RIA: Adobe Still Leads

So Microsoft [announces](http://nibbles.wordpress.com/2008/06/03/silverlight-2-beta-2-and-new-tutorials/) Silverlight Beta 2 @ TechEd 2008\. Is duplex communications really push, or still age old poll?

Microsoft entered the data fabric [space](http://blogs.msdn.com/velocity/) with [Velocity](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=b24c3708-eeff-4055-a867-19b5851e7cd2&DisplayLang=en).

[Adobe](http://www.adobe.com/) continues to stretch its lead in the RIA space – [Buzzword](http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2008/Jun-02.html) and now [Acrobat](http://www.adobe.com/acom/). When will Microsoft (Silverlight) catch ConnectNow?

InfoQ has an [article](http://www.infoq.com/articles/ebay-scalability-best-practices) on eBay scalability. “Cache Appropriately” is the current best practice my team has been working on recently.
