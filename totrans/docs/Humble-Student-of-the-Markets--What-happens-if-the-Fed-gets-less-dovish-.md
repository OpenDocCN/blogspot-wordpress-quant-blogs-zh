# Humble Student of the Markets: What happens if the Fed gets less dovish?

**Mid-week market update**

: There doesn't seem to be much of a point in writing about the technical condition of the market when its likely path is dominated by a binary event like the FOMC meeting this week. So I thought that I would write about how to interpret and react to the FOMC statement instead.

From a technical perspective, the markets are also ripe for a reversal. The USD Index, which is a key indicator of monetary policy divergence and driver of US corporate earnings growth, is currently testing an important support level.

Hedge funds have reversed out of their crowded long in the USD and they are now slightly short.

The flip side of the USD weakness coin is commodity strength. The post child of commodity strength are the precious metals and

A less dovish message from the Fed this week has the potential to embolden dollar bulls and panic commodity bears.
