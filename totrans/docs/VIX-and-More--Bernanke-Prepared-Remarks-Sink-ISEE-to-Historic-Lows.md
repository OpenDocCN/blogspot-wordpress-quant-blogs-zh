# VIX and More: Bernanke Prepared Remarks Sink ISEE to Historic Lows

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/01/bernanke-prepared-remarks-sink-isee-to.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/01/bernanke-prepared-remarks-sink-isee-to.html#0001-01-01)

The [ISEE](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/ISEE) is at historic lows with Ben Bernanke 1 1/2 hours into his testimony before the [House Budget Committee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_the_Budget).

Between 9:50 and 10:10 a.m. EST, approximately 290,000 new put positions were opened in individual equities on the ISEE. This is in sharp contrast to the meager 34,000 or so new call positions that were initiated during the same period.

Given that a copy of Bernanke's prepared remarks we distributed at approximately 10:00, the mostly likely conclusion is that some of the larger players are voting with their feet that the Fed's too little too late approach continues to offer a significant downside opportunity for those who are short the market.

At 11:30 a.m., the ISEE has climbed to 37, but with such a large number of puts already up on the scoreboard, there is a good chance that today will see a new single day closing low for the ISEE.
