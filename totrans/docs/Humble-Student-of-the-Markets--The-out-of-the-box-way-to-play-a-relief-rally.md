# Humble Student of the Markets: The out-of-the-box-way to play a relief rally

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2023/10/the-out-of-box-way-to-play-relief-rally.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2023/10/the-out-of-box-way-to-play-relief-rally.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models** 

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post, 

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The 

**Trend Asset Allocation Model**

 is an asset allocation model that applies trend-following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity prices. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. The performance and full details of a model portfolio based on the out-of-sample signals of the Trend Model can be found

[here](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/trend-model-report-card/)

.

My inner trader uses a 

**trading model**

, which is a blend of price momentum (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa). Subscribers receive real-time alerts of model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of the email alerts is updated weekly 

[here](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/trading-track-record/)

. The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that began in March 2016 is shown below.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Buy equities (Last changed from “sell” on 28-Jul-2023)*
*   Trend Model signal: Bullish (Last changed from “neutral” on 28-Jul-2023)*
*   Trading model: Bullish (Last changed from “neutral” on 22-Sep-2023)*

: I generally update model readings on my

#### Poised for a rebound

There are numerous signs that the U.S. stock market is oversold, washed out and poised for a FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) rebound. The latest indicator is the CNN Fear & Greed Index, which is beginning to recover from levels seen at the market lows of October 2022 and March 2023.
