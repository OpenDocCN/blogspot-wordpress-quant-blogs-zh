## Agile: Principles and Values

Mitch over on Mountain Goat has a classic must-read posting for new [ScrumMasters](http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/three-tips-for-new-scrummasters#When:18:54:22Z).  I only hope that people read and remember.  “do the simplest thing possible” and “what ‘done’ means” are spot on, its just unfortunate that so many people who say “We are agile” just don’t get the concept.
