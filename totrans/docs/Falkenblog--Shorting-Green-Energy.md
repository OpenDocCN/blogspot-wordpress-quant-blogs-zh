# Falkenblog: Shorting Green Energy

> 来源：[http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2012/12/shorting-green-energy.html#0001-01-01](http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2012/12/shorting-green-energy.html#0001-01-01)

A Business Insider

[post](http://www.businessinsider.com/renixx-renewable-energy-index-decline-2012-12)

showed the remarkable 98% decline in the RENIXX since 2008, and index that tracks the world´s 30 largest companies in the renewable energy industry.

I found a green ETF,

[GEX](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=GEX)

,which is Market Vectors Global Alternative Energy fund. It's down about 85% since 2008\.

Perhaps there's a very simple strategy here.
