# VIX and More: VIX Tops 50 for First Time Since Mid-December

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/01/vix-tops-50-for-first-time-since-mid.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/01/vix-tops-50-for-first-time-since-mid.html#0001-01-01)

With the SPX failing to find support at 850 and financials falling another 6% this morning, the VIX has [spiked](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20spikes) all the way to 51.03, up 17.9% so far today and up 32.3% from just six sessions ago.

Since the large gap down at the open, today’s action has been more of a slow grind than a sharp panic, suggesting that there could be a fair distance still to the down side. SPX support may come in the 820-830 range, but if those levels fail to hold, the possibility of a drop back down to 740 suddenly looms large.
