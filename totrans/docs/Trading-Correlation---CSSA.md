# Trading Correlation

October 8, 2010

CSS was recently featured in Active Trader Magazine — a publication that is well worth reading for trading strategy. We wrote an article about using correlation regimes to guide mean-reversion strategies. A link to the intro can be found here: [http://www.activetradermag.com/index.php/c/Trading_Strategies/d/Trading_correlation](http://www.activetradermag.com/index.php/c/Trading_Strategies/d/Trading_correlation) We will take a closer look at this topic in future posts.
