# Humble Student of the Markets: Red sky in the morning

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2018/09/red-sky-in-morning.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2018/09/red-sky-in-morning.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models**

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post,

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The

**Trend Model**

is an asset allocation model which applies trend following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or contraction (bearish)?"

My inner trader uses the trading component of the Trend Model to look for changes in the direction of the main Trend Model signal. A bullish Trend Model signal that gets less bullish is a trading "sell" signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading "buy" signal. The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. The turnover rate of the trading model is high, and it has varied between 150% to 200% per month.

. The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that began in March 2016 is shown below.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Buy equities*
*   Trend Model signal: Neutral*
*   Trading model: Bearish*

**Global slowdown in progress**

There is an adage among the nautical set:

> Red sky at night, sailor`s delight
> Red sky in the morning, sailors take warning

In the global economy, there are signs of a red sky in the morning. Last week, 

[IHS Markit](https://ihsmarkit.com/research-analysis/global-manufacturing-pmi-at-21month-low-as-exports-stagnate.html)

highlighted falling global manufacturing PMI.

Stagnant growth can be attributed to a slowdown in export orders in every major region of the world. In particular, the export order components of the UK, Japan, China, and much of Asia are below 50, indicating negative growth.

The global trade slowdown is confirmed by the OECD, which is a sign that the trade war is starting to bite.

Let's take a tour around the world and see how the global economy is progressing.
