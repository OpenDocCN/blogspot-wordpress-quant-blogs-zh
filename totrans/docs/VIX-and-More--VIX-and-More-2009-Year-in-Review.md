# VIX and More: VIX and More 2009 Year in Review

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/12/vix-and-more-2009-year-in-review.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/12/vix-and-more-2009-year-in-review.html#0001-01-01)

While I thought the [Top Posts of 2009](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/12/top-posts-of-2009.html) captured many of the high points on the blog during the past year, I also believe it might be interesting for readers to hear about which posts were some of my favorites.

Looking back at everything I wrote in 2009, I suspect that my most important work was probably with [VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX), the iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN. I believe I was the first to analyze VXX in any detail, discuss some of the shortcomings and ultimately tie it all together in [Why the VXX Is Not a Good Short-Term or Long-Term Play](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/10/why-vxx-is-not-good-short-term-or-long.html). Along the way, I think [VXX Calculations, VIX Futures and Time Decay](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/05/vxx-calculations-vix-futures-and-time.html) was the piece that shaped the thinking of many investors. In terms of timeliness, [VXX Juice Factor and Portfolio Insurance Implications](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/02/vxx-juice-factor-and-portfolio.html) was a warning shot I fired in the first month after VXX was launched.

While volatility declined almost in a straight line for the entire year, stocks did not. In retrospect, [The Possibility of a ‘Stealth Bottom’](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/03/possibility-of-stealth-bottom.html) was one of my best predictions and my March 5^(th) [SPX at 687; Intermediate Bottom Potential Is High](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/03/spx-at-687-intermediate-bottom.html) was only one day early.

Some of my favorite posts of the year were related to how to think about trading. The [Trader Development Stage Model – Version 2.0](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/10/trader-stage-development-model-version.html) was a way for me to articulate some of my thinking on the subject of how traders evolve. In [The Trader Development Stage Model and the Jump from Stocks to Options](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/09/trader-stage-development-model-and-jump.html) I liked how the model explained how and why new options traders get into trouble. A precursor to the model was a pair of posts [Kafka, Surrealism and Trading](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/09/kafka-surrealism-and-trading.html) and [Comfort Zones, Focus and Thinking Like a Biotech Firm](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/09/comfort-zones-focus-and-thinking-like.html) which address trading strategy development. Earlier in the year, [Can Options Selling Make You a Better Trader?](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/03/can-selling-options-make-you-better.html) probably got the wheels turning about some of the elements of superior trading performance.

In another impromptu series of posts, I dipped my toe into behavioral finance in [Availability Bias and Disaster Imprinting](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/11/availability-bias-and-disaster.html). The ideas from that post became much more compelling when I tied them back to the VIX in [The VIX:VXV Ratio, Availability Bias and Disaster Imprinting](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/11/vixvxv-ratio-availability-bias-and.html) and later in [VIX Data to Support Availability Bias and Disaster Imprinting Hypothesis](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/11/vix-data-to-support-availability-bias.html).

It turns out that the behavioral finance posts and several posts on realized volatility shared some analytical ideas. In [The Gap Between the VIX and Realized Volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/08/gap-between-vix-and-realized-volatility.html) I posted my what I believe is my first graphical representation of the difference between the VIX and realized volatility. When that extended gap finally came to an end, I posted about it in [Chart of the Week: No More Free Lunch for Volatility Sellers?](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/11/chart-of-week-no-more-free-lunch-for.html)

With other voices now regularly discussing the VIX, I don’t feel the need to post on that subject as much as I once did, but my incredulity recently boiled over in [The VIX Spike Conundrum](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/11/vix-spike-conundrum.html) after I saw many pundits essentially suggesting that investors panic along with the crowd.

Last but not least, two of my favorite humorous interludes were [Roubini and the VIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/06/roubini-and-vix.html) and [Blogging Network a Better Buy than Business Week?](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/10/blogging-network-better-buy-than.html)

On a personal note, I am delighted to say than in many instances it was reader comments and private emails which provided the inspiration and kicked started a dialogue of ideas that eventually resulted in some of these posts. I continue to be surprised by the extent to which blogging is a collaborative process and am thankful to all who have made my life richer in 2009 by sharing their questions and insights.
