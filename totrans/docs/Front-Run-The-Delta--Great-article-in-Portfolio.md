> From the Scorched Earth Files:
> 
> Andrew Lahde, manager of a small California hedge fund, Lahde Capital, burst into the spotlight last year after his one-year-old fund returned [866 percent](http://www.portfolio.com/executives/features/2008/04/14/Brilliant-Real-Estate-Moves) betting against the subprime collapse.
> 
> Last month, he did the unthinkable -- he shut things down, claiming dealing with his bank counterparties had become too risky. Today, Lahde passed along his ["goodbye" letter](http://www.portfolio.com/images/feeds/blogs/AndrewLahdeFarewell.pdf), a rollicking missive on everything from greed to economic philosophy. Enjoy.

I did enjoy.
