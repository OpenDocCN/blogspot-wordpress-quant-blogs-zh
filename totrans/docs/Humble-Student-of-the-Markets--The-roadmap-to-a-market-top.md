# Humble Student of the Markets: The roadmap to a market top

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2016/05/the-roadmap-to-market-top.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2016/05/the-roadmap-to-market-top.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models**

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on research outlined in our post 

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The 

**Trend Model**

 is an asset allocation model which applies trend following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or contraction (bearish)?"

My inner trader uses the 

**trading component**

 of the Trend Model to look for changes in direction of the main Trend Model signal. A bullish Trend Model signal that gets less bullish is a trading "sell" signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend Model signal that gets less bullish is a trading "buy" signal. The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. Past trading of the trading model has shown turnover rates of about 200% per month.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Buy equities*
*   Trend Model signal: Neutral*
*   Trading model: Bearish*

* 

*The performance chart and model readings have been delayed by a week out of respect to our paying subscribers.* **Update schedule**

: I generally update model readings on my 

[site](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/)

 on weekends and tweet any changes during the week at @humblestudent. Subscribers will also receive email notices of any changes in my trading portfolio.

**Not turning bearish yet**

No, my inner investor isn't turning bearish, but I believe it is prudent to be thinking about how a market top develops. The bull market that began in 2009 is getting mature and I am getting starting to watch for signs that a market top is developing. My analytical framework is as follows:

*   **Macro-economic analysis**: I am grateful for the work by New Deal democrat in his recent post [A roadmap to the next recession](http://community.xe.com/blog/xe-market-analysis/next-recession). This chart from Gene Epstein at [Barron's](http://www.barrons.com/articles/5-reasons-the-stock-market-wont-crashyet-1464408349) shows the risks to equities should economic growth stall and roll over. While stock prices can fall and correct at any time, the most severe declines have been associated with recessions.

*   **Growth and valuation**: I think of stocks in terms of the two components of the PE ratio. First, how much is E like to grow? Second, will the P/E ratio expand or contract? The big question in the current environment is the intersection of growing E as the Fed embarks on a tightening cycle. How will stock prices respond as earnings rise, but higher interest rates puts downward pressure on the P/E ratio?
