## boost::bind

### April 30, 2008

Ii thought I was a real C++ coder, ‘cos I’ve been cutting C++ since 92, and I can hack STL algos and threaded code. But this week I’ve become painfully aware that I don’t know how to use boost::bind. I’ve done a little reading, and now I’m not totally thrown by seeing a _1 in the code. Still, any tips on good boost tutorials will be gratefully accepted.
