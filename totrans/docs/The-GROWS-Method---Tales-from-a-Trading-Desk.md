## The GROWS Method

Andy [Hunt](http://blog.toolshed.com/2015/05/the-failure-of-agile.html) provides a good [overview](https://www.infoq.com/articles/grows-method-experiment) of GROWS, touching on the issues of Scrum and XP practices:

> if you and/or your organization are following the XP practices, or the Scrum practices, then you are not agile

The Dreyfus Model looks like a great framework to aid “agile” teams.  It offers give stages of progression to gain specific skills:

*   Novice – Rules-based, just wants to accomplish the immediate goal
*   Advanced Beginner – Needs small, frequent rewards; big picture is confusing
*   Competent – Can develop conceptual models, can troubleshoot
*   Proficient – Driven to seek larger conceptual model, can self-correct
*   Expert – Intuition-based, always seeking better methods

Which leads to a great comment by Andy which is utterly true:

> change needs to come from one’s own desire

Having read Andy’s [article](https://www.infoq.com/articles/grows-method-experiment), coupled with the [GROWS](http://growsmethod.com) web site, it would appear that GROWS is quite an interesting method to provide guidance for teams to experiment, provide, learn and move forwards – its particularly nice to see checklists called out in [GROWS](http://growsmethod.com/practices/index-by-stage.html)
