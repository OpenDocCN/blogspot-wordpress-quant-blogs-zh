# Wrong Focus? | Tales from a Trading Desk

## Wrong Focus?

The Indepentent [recently](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/fiddling-while-rbs-burned--new-book-reveals-fred-the-shred-goodwins-fatal-obsessions-8795202.html) (well last month) has an interesting article on RBS – specifically Fred the Shred Goodwin.  The Daily Mail has a similar [article](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2408605/Fred-Goodwin-How-RBS-boss-fiddled-bank-headed-45bn-meltdown.html) the day before.  I’ve not read the [book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Making-Happen-Goodwin-British-Economy/dp/147111354X), Making it Happen: Fred Goodwin, RBS and the Men Who Blew Up the British Economy, but can only imagine the entertainment value based on the newspaper articles.
