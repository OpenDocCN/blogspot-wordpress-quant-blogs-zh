# VIX and More: Update on ‘People Trading BIDU Also Traded…’

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/10/update-on-people-trading-bidu-also.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/10/update-on-people-trading-bidu-also.html#0001-01-01)

Apropos of my earlier comments on

<country-region st="on"><place st="on">China</place></country-region>

and the FXI, I feel compelled to made two additional observations:

ProShares

[just announced](http://www.proshares.com/resources/news/10750361.html)

a new ETF that targets

*double*

the inverse of the FXI. The

UltraShort FTSE/Xinhua China 25 (ticker FXP) is slated to launch sometime in November – and should provide a wild ride for anyone tall enough and brave enough to get on this roller coaster.Given that BIDU is trading up some 14 points as I type this, I have updated the optionsXpress Trading Patterns feature (“People Trading BIDU Also Traded…”) which I first posted about [a month ago](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/09/bidu-hogs-eventually-get-slaughtered.html). Many of the names are the same; this also has the appearance of a who’s who of speculative momentum trading.

Finally, I am officially neutral going into tomorrow’s FOMC announcement, but whichever side you are playing, be sure to fasten your seatbelt and cut your losses before they run away from you.
