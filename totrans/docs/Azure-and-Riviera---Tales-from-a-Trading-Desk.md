## Azure and Riviera

I spent another hour speaking to Microsoft’s Cloud ISV Team last night. Hopefully people are beginning to understand my view of the landscape. Not sure I’ll get a Redmond trip however 😦 – unlike some [people](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2009/05/microsoft-cep-part-2.html) 😉

[Riviera](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/riviera) uses Windows Workflow in Windows Azure. Last time I looked WF on Azure was fairly basic> Unfortunately the documentation for Riviera is basic, hence I suspect I need to download the source and have a look to understand if I can now do an RFQ via WF in Azure.
