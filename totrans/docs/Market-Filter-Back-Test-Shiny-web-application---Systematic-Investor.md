## Market Filter Back Test Shiny web application

Today, I want to share the [Market Filter Back Test](http://glimmer.rstudio.com/systematicin/market.filter/) application (code at [GitHub](https://github.com/systematicinvestor/SIT/tree/master/Shiny/market.filter)).

This is the forth application in the series of examples (I plan to share 5 examples) that will demonstrate the amazing [Shiny](http://www.rstudio.com/shiny/) framework and [Systematic Investor Toolbox](https://systematicinvestor.wordpress.com/systematic-investor-toolbox/) to analyze stocks, make back-tests, and create summary reports.

The motivation for this series of posts is to show how to translate, with minimal effort, your back-test scripts into live web applications that can either be run from the Shiny server or your personal computer.

Please note that Back Test applications take longer time to update the plots/tables and hence maybe more appropriate to run from your local computer.

I will post the next example application on Monday.

Have a good long weekend
