## Sterling closes

### August 28, 2009

The UK’s [debt management office](http://www.dmo.gov.uk) publishes closing prices calculated as an average of Gilt dealer prices [here](http://www.dmo.gov.uk/index.aspx?page=Gilts/Daily_Prices). One application of the prices is dealer execution of fund manager orders for execution at the close. The dealer and real money manager don’t know what the execution price will be when the order is placed, but that’s not a problem as the fund manager trusts the DMO price.
