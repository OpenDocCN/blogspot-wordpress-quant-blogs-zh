## The Winning Formula

Just finished David Coulthard book, The Winning Formula.  Many of us have heard for year that sport has a lot to [teach](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/connect/better-business/lessons-from-rugby/what-business-leaders-can-learn/) business.  David’s book falls into this category of learning 🙂  Here are a few examples:

*   Page 66, totally commit, indispensable
*   Page 102, get the best from a group of people
*   Page 104, team strategy
*   Page 117, “A common problem I see with high-level business people is a failure to respect everyone in their business – not just other executives or managers but right down to the receptionist worker or the cleaner”
*   Page 120, never forget the important of engaging with people
*   Page 122, Anti-pattern – spending too much time writing reports and analysing past failures
*   Page 127, culture that respects the chain of command
*   Page 153, sounds like a retrospective to me 🙂  Or maybe its an [SRE](https://landing.google.com/sre/) post-mortem?
*   Page 168, explains the sports jacket 🙂
*   Page 197, quoting Bill Gates, “Success is a lousy teacher.  It seduces smart people into thinking they can’t lose”
*   Page 215, create the right atmosphere – encourage innovation and a culture of creativity
