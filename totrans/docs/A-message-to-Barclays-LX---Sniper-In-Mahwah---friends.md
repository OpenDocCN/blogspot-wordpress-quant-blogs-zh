From an old specialist of business:
*‘Hence, even though we naturally have a free will, we should mind our thinking, not because our liberty and will have abandoned us, but because it is necessary to freely mind our free will and bind it with many ropes, ever since sin has been released. Those ropes are the laws. They teach us not only what we have to do, but also what we have to desire. We are bound to observe them all and implement them in our contracts, so that we do business not according to our desires and appetites, but according to what the laws show and order us to do. The law is the rule of our life through which we render our works measured and balanced*.’
Tomas de Mercado, *Summa de tratos y contratos*, 1571.
