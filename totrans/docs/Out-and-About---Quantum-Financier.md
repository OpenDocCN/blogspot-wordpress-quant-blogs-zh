# Out and About – Quantum Financier

> 来源：[https://quantumfinancier.wordpress.com/2010/06/30/out-and-about/#0001-01-01](https://quantumfinancier.wordpress.com/2010/06/30/out-and-about/#0001-01-01)

The Quantum Financier blog will take a pause since I will be away for work, I am leaving Sunday and will return on August 13th and I will most likely be unable to post during this period. Upon my return you can expect the finale for some unfinished series of post.

I will still be available by e-mail if you have questions or suggestions. If you have things you would like me to post on in the future, I encourage you to share the idea with me as I always welcome reader input.

Until next time, have a good summer.
