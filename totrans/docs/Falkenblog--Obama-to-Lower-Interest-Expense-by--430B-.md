# Falkenblog: Obama to Lower Interest Expense by $430B?

> 来源：[http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2011/09/obama-to-lower-interest-expense-by-430b.html#0001-01-01](http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2011/09/obama-to-lower-interest-expense-by-430b.html#0001-01-01)

I saw this number in various news summaries, but no details (eg,

[here](http://www.dailyfinance.com/2011/09/19/obama-to-propose-1-5-trillion-in-new-tax-revenue/)

and

[here](http://content.usatoday.com/communities/theoval/post/2011/09/obama-unveils-3-trillion-plus-debt-cut-plan/1)

). I suppose if you use future values instead of present values, when you lower the deficit by a dollar in some future year--say 2014--you generate an almost infinite amount of interest savings on our perpetual debt.
