# Quantitative Trading: A free Matlab-to-Interactive Brokers API

> 来源：[http://epchan.blogspot.com/2009/07/free-matlab-to-interactive-brokers-api.html#0001-01-01](http://epchan.blogspot.com/2009/07/free-matlab-to-interactive-brokers-api.html#0001-01-01)

For readers who do not want to pay for a commercial Matlab2IB API,

[Max Dama](http://www.maxdama.com/2008/12/interactive-brokers-via-matlab.html)

has put together a free alternative.

[Domenic](http://www.tradingwithmatlab.com/home)

has provided some additional sample Matlab codes for trading.

A user of the

[commercial product](http://www.exchangeapi.com/ProductOverview.htm)

that I previously mentioned reports that "My problem with the matlab2ib product was that it did not have a function for all the Active X methods. ( for example the Market Scanners, Real time Bars and Fundamental Data methods are missing). I also had issues when I tried to steam in trades data(I'm not sure if the matlab2ib product allows you to even do this?)." Apparently Max's API has included these methods, though I have not personally tried them.
