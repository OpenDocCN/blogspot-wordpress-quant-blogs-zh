# VIX and More: One Day 20% Spikes in the VIX

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/02/one-day-20-spikes-in-vix.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/02/one-day-20-spikes-in-vix.html#0001-01-01)

There have been 20 VIX spikes of 20% or more in one day since 1990.  Today makes 21, with the VIX currently up 21% on the day at 13.52.

Looking at that group of 20 VIX spikes, you can see the footprint of 9/11, the dot com bubble bursting, the Asian financial crisis and similar difficult periods.  It is worth pointing out that in 17 of those 20 instances, the VIX was lower 3 days later, 5 days later and 10 days later (interestingly enough, it was a different grouping of VIX spikes that defied the trend in each time period.)

If history is any guide, the VIX should subside about 10% over the course of the next three days and another 2% or so by a week from now.  This is the [mean reversion](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/01/week-in-vix-january-7-2007-introduction.html) tendency of the VIX at work.

While the SPX is ‘only’ down 1.5% at the moment, it is also worth recalling [previous research](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/02/vix-and-3-spx-drops.html) posted here that when the SPX drops 3%, the VIX’s mean reversion tendency over the next five trading days paints a telling [picture](http://i104.photobucket.com/albums/m163/bl82/VIXwithSPX-3pct.gif).
