# Quantifiable Edges: This Setup Suggests More Upside In The Next Few Days

Thursday marked the 2nd day in a row that SPY posted an unfilled gap up.  It also closed at a 50-day high.  The unfilled up-gaps are considered a sign of strength.  Unfilled up gaps can sometimes be seen as a sign of strength.  The study below examines whether this may be the case when the market is at an intermediate-term high.

The size of the follow-through isn't terribly large, but it has been very, very consistent that some follow through was achieved.  This suggests a good chance at more upside in the next few days.

I will note that not every study I am seeing is bullish right now.  There is a bit of a mix.
