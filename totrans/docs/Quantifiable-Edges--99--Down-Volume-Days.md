# Quantifiable Edges: 99% Down Volume Days

The NYSE Up Volume % came in under 1% on Friday. In other words, over 99% of the volume was in declining securities. Breadth this extreme is remarkable. According to my database there have only been 4 other days since 1970 where the NYSE Up Volume % came in at under 1%. I’ve listed them below along with their next-day returns.

Traders may also want to a look at these dates on a chart. You’ll note that they all either marked an intermediate-term low, or were very close to one.
