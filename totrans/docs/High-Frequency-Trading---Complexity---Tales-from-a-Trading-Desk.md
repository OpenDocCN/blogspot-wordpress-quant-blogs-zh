## High Frequency Trading – Complexity

Transparent Simplicity has an excellent [posting](http://www.transparentsimplicity.com/2012/11/the-problems-detailed-below-of-order-types-rebates-and-failed-regulations-are-symptomatic-of-the-deeper-more-systemic-pr.html), “The Complexity of High Frequency Trading” which provides an interesting read on the complexities of the market.  Rule 610, part of the Cancel Spam problem.  Odd Lots – madness that they are not reported to the consolidated tape.

> As Themis Trading [argues](http://blog.themistrading.com/themis-calls-for-sec-moratorium-on-approving-exchange-order-types/), the new order types are *“**perks sold to them by the exchanges – including colocation, data feeds, and dubious order types – to make sure that they maximize the number of free shots at a risk free rebate**.*This means *they want to bid and be first in line, and only when they are assured that there are other buyers deep behind them**,* and collect rebates.  If they are successful and buy stock and collect a rebate, they can turn around and instantly sell that stock at the same price to the person behind them, still making a profit*. **This is not liquidity provision.  **They game ways to be at the top of the book in stocks that already have the liquidity that serves as a backstop**.”*
