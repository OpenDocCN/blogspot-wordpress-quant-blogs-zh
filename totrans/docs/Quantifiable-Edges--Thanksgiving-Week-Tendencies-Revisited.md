# Quantifiable Edges: Thanksgiving Week Tendencies Revisited

Historically Thanksgiving week has shown some very strong tendencies. Last year

[in the 11/23/09 blog](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2009/11/daily-breakdown-of-thanksgiving-week.html)

I broke down the returns by day of the week. I have updated that table below.

Monday and Tuesday before Thanksgiving don’t seem to carry a sizable edge. Monday’s total return was actually negative until 2008 when it posted a gain of over 6%. Wednesday and Friday surrounding Thanksgiving have shown strong upside tendencies and the Monday after has shown a sizable downside tendency.
