Great

[anecdote](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323384604578324442830547044.html?mod=WSJ_Opinion_LEADTop)

on crony capitalism about Jack Lew, the latest Citi employee who will be in charge of a lot of financial regulation:

> As for the Citi paycheck, the story is how Wall Street has become a get-rich-turnstile for Democratic political operatives. The terms of Mr. Lew's original employment contract with Citi included a bonus guarantee if he left the bank for a "high level position with the United States government or regulatory body."

> Most companies include incentives for top employees not to leave, but in this case the contract was written to reward Mr. Lew for treating the bank like a revolving door. Citi says it likes to accommodate employees who do public service or work at nonprofits. But the Lew contract was specific about a senior job in the federal government. There would be no special payout if he left to run the Red Cross or the New York state budget office.
