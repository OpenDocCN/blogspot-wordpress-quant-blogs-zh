## 2022 Rules of Engagement

Following on from [2006](https://mdavey.wordpress.com/2006/10/05/rules-of-engagement/)/[2013](https://mdavey.wordpress.com/2013/05/30/the-rules-of-engagement/), here’s the updated set:

1.  Be yourself
2.  Lead from the front
3.  Code == source of truth
4.  Observability from day 1
5.  Working backwards with tenets and mechanisms
6.  Customer centric UX Design (Engineers are user too)
7.  Team efficiency is important
8.  Measure and adapt
9.  Behaviour changes culture
10.  Keep the message simple, and repeat
11.  Simple over complexity
12.  Mandates often have consequences. Autonomy needs an economy
