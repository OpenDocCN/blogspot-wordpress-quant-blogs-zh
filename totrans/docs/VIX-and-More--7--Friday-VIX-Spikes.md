# VIX and More: 7% Friday VIX Spikes

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/02/7-friday-vix-spikes.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/02/7-friday-vix-spikes.html#0001-01-01)

So the VIX jumped 7% on Friday.  Considering that the VIX also managed to set a new low for the 100 day SMA for the 34^(th) consecutive day, it is a little early to declare the recent period of low volatility to be over.  Still, Friday’s move warrants closer inspection.

Looking at how the VIX has bounced back from sub-10 closes, the current 11.10 reading is right in the lower middle of the range for where we “should be,” based on [historical precedent](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/02/bouncing-back-from-sub-10-vix.html) 13 days removed from the 9.89 close on January 24^(th).

It happens about once every two weeks, on average.  Interestingly, a 7% jump occurs just 5.2% of the time on Fridays, but 10.2% of the time on any other day of the week.  Monday sees the most volatility, a subject I will tackle in this space in the near future.

Getting back to the 7% rise on Fridays, as the adjacent composite graphic shows, there is typically a small (0.6%) follow-through on the day after the +7% Friday, with a gradual lessening of volatility over the course of the next 1 ½ weeks.  The data for the high closes over the two weeks following these 45 Friday 7% spikes also supports the idea of the Friday spike and Monday follow-through as being the high point in this sequence is: fully 27% of the time, the Friday closed held up as the high close over the next two weeks; another 20% of the time, the Monday close turned out to be the high close during this period.

Going forward, keep in mind that many VIX spikes run out of steam [2-4 days](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/01/what-to-expect-from-vix-spike.htmlhttp:/vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/01/what-to-expect-from-vix-spike.html) after the initial move, so if Wednesday’s retails sales numbers or Bernanke's testimony does not put a scare into the markets and keep them on edge, the VIX spike will likely already have been trampled by the next bull leg.

For now I am slightly bearish on the VIX, with a close eye ready for the Tuesday-Wednesday action.
