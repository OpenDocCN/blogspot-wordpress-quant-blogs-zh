## Internet Service Bus

MIX08 is 4 or so months away and already there are a few [session](https://content.visitmix.com/public/sessions.aspx) details available on the web site. [Dennis Pilarinos](http://www.dennispi.com/) session currently look one of the more interesting ones since it appear to be providing a glimpse of Microsoft’s [Internet Service Bus](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/EN-US/library/bb906065.aspx). I’m curious to see what Microsoft will actually [offer](http://www.thearchitect.co.uk/weblog/archives/2007/04/000473.html) in this space other than the expected [BizTalk](http://labs.biztalk.net/) plus WCF – will this just be a B2B [solution](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,2120846,00.asp), or could I use the [pub/sub](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/EN-US/library/bb906065.aspx) between client/server?
