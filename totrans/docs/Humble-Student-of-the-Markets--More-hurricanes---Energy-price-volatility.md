Philip J. Klotzbach and William M. Gray of the

[Tropical Meteorology Project](http://hurricane.atmos.colostate.edu/forecasts/)

at the Colorado State University has issued a new

[2010 forecast](http://hurricane.atmos.colostate.edu/forecasts/2010/april2010/apr2010.pdf)

and it calls for a higher than average hurricane season.

More storms will mean higher energy prices and greater price volatility later this year.

Be prepared!
