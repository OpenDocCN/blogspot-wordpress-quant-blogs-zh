I continue to enjoy the work you post. Thanks for helping all of us.
Your new indicators posted at the web site – will they also be available in Excel format? I ask because I use neither Tradestation nor Amibroker, and working through the Excel formulas and then creating same for my Metastock makes me appreciate the thought behind the indicator.
Thanks again.
