# Humble Student of the Markets: The (mini) ride of the Phoenix

I have written often about the

[Phoenix effect](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2008/05/waiting-for-ride-on-phoenix.html)

, or the profit potential of holding low-priced, beaten up and near-bankrupt stocks in a bullish recovery. Bespoke recently documented an example of the performance of such a basket

.

When the Phoenix does finally rise, the upside potential for a portfolio of such stocks is a triple or more. However, I wouldn’t rush out and buy them yet. Wait for a market rally and a re-test of the recent lows before buying in. I would expect that re-test to occur in the next few months.
