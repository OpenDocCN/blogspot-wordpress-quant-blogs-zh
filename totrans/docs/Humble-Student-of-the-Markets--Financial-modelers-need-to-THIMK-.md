# Humble Student of the Markets: Financial modelers need to THIMK!

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2009/06/financial-modelers-need-to-thimk.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2009/06/financial-modelers-need-to-thimk.html#0001-01-01)

There was a cartoon from many years ago showing a man sitting at a desk. His eyebrows were furrowed and he was obviously deep in thought. He had a sign above him that read

***THIMK***

!

Long time readers of these pages know that I am an advocate of modelers to think long and hard about the assumptions behind their models before turning them on. Unfortunately, many are

*thimking*

instead of thinking.

Here is another example.

**Using Altman Z for financials?**

I recently participated in an online discussion in response to a financial modeler’s question about applying Altman Z to financial companies. (See my previous discussion on the limitations of Altman Z

[here](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2008/05/limitations-of-altman-z.html)

.)

If you don’t know the Altman Z, the formula is a function of liquidity, balance sheet strength and earnings power:

> Altman Z =
> 1.2 X Working capital/Total assets +
> 1.4 X Retained earnings/Total assets +
> 3.3 X EBIT/Total assets +
> 0.6 X Market value of equity/Book value of debt +
> 0.999 X Sales/Total assets

The formulation was originally conceived for operating industrials, not financials. It appeared to me that for someone to even ask the question about applying Altman Z to financials indicates that he hasn’t sufficiently thought about the assumptions behind the model.

You could plug it the numbers, it would give you an answer. GIGO: Garbage In, Garbage Out. It would be as useful as newly minted MBAs trying to apply Black Scholes to fixed income instruments.

**The Financial Modeler’s Manifesto**

Over at his blog, Paul Wilmott posted the

[Financial Modeler’s Manifesto](http://www.wilmott.com/blogs/paul/index.cfm/2009/1/8/Financial-Modelers-Manifesto)

, which starts with an echo of the Communist Manifesto:

> A spectre is haunting Markets – the spectre of illiquidity, frozen credit, and the failure of financial models.

It concludes with “Modelers' Hippocratic Oath”:

> ~ I will remember that I didn't make the world, and it doesn't satisfy my equations.
> ~ Though I will use models boldly to estimate value, I will not be overly impressed by mathematics.
> ~ I will never sacrifice reality for elegance without explaining why I have done so.
> ~ Nor will I give the people who use my model false comfort about its accuracy. Instead, I will make explicit its assumptions and oversights.
> ~ I understand that my work may have enormous effects on society and the economy, many of them beyond my comprehension.

I wholeheartedly agree. Read the whole thing. Examine the assumptions in your models and apply them intelligently. If you haven’t seen Wilmott’s

, it’s also well worth a visit too.

Happy modeling!
