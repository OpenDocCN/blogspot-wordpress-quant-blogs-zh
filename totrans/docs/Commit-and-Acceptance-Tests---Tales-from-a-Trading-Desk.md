## Commit and Acceptance Tests

“Acceptance [Testing](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/acceptance-testing-cd) for Continuous Delivery” offers some interesting thoughts around testing in a deployment pipeline world. First, a view of automated Definition of Done (DoD):

*   Commit Tests – asset what the engineer thinks the code should do
*   Acceptance Tests – asset that the code does what the user wants the code to do
*   Acceptance Criteria – recognise the value of a story

A good Acceptance Test is:

> An Executable Specification of the Behaviour of the System

Great slide on who owns the tests 🙂

DSL – Language of the Problem Domain 🙂

Anti-Patterns in Acceptance Testing – print he slide out, and pin it to the wall 🙂  Then stop using a separate testing/QA team
