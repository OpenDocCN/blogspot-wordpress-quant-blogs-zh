## “I am a one in ten…”

### October 3, 2006

Remember that UB40 tune from the early 80s recession ?  Or, to put the question another way, how much can we automate ?  [Mostly’s recent post](http://mostly.wordpress.com/2006/10/02/90-of-traders-face-the-axe-as-computers-take-control/) about only 10% of traders surviving growing computerisation made me think again about the automation of fixed income market making. Of course, the [IBM paper](http://www-935.ibm.com/services/us/imc/pdf/ge510-6270-trader.pdf) he refers to is somewhat self serving: IBM think you need to select a strategic technology partner to meet the challenges of the next 10 year. I wonder who they could be thinking of ?

A lot of the market making job has been automated in the last few years…

*   Pricing: calc engines driven by depth ticks from Eurex or Liffe constantly reprice bonds
*   Quoting: autoquoting systems driven by the pricing engines crank out bid and ask with sizes to multiple ECNs
*   Auto RFQ: on quote driven markets a dealers trading system will handle the negotiation with clients raising RFQs. Mostly [alluded to this in an earlier post when he mentioned tiering](http://mostly.wordpress.com/2006/09/28/certainty-of-execution/).
*   STP: most bond trades flow straight through to settlement with no manual intervention

So what remains to be automated ?  To me it seems that the big ones are inventory management, and the pricing of liquidity. If we can do those, we make a lot of traders redundant, and maybe us techies can collect their bonuses 😉  But how do we get the turkeys to vote for Christmas ?
