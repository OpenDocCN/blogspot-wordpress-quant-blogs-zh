# VIX and More: Portfolio A1 Roars Back Behind TSO and TEX

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/06/portfolio-a1-roars-back-behind-tso-and.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/06/portfolio-a1-roars-back-behind-tso-and.html#0001-01-01)

After two weeks of losing ground to the benchmark S&P 500 index, Portfolio A1 roared back last week, with all five stocks in the green.  The strong performance was led by a 6.4% gain from newcomer [Tesoro (TSO)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=tso&hl=en) and a 6.3% gain in portfolio leader [Terex (TEX)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=tex&hl=en), which is now up over 29% in just 3 ½ months.  The gains in TSO are particularly gratifying, as they allow me to get my hopes up that the fifth and final holding in the portfolio may now begin to add value rather than destroy it, as has generally been the case so far.

As shown in the graphic below, the portfolio now has a healthy 4.75% cushion on the S&P 500.  This is below the year’s best 6.77% advantage from April 29^(th), but at least is heading in the right direction once again.

For accounting purposes, it should be noted that TSO recorded a 2 for 1 split during the week.

There are no changes to the portfolio for the coming week.

A snapshot of the portfolio is as follows:
