## Bitcoin – Maths Based Security and a Ledger

Bitcoin is clearly generating a [lot](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-04-10/meet-the-bitcoin-millionaires) of interest for many reasons.  On the technical side there are a few interesting articles to be read:

*   How Bitcoin [works](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/How_bitcoin_works)
*   How Bitcoin Works Under the [Hood](http://www.imponderablethings.com/2013/07/how-bitcoin-works-under-hood.html) – provides some information on the peer network, digital signatures and hence the mathematically protected digital currency.
*   How Bitcoin Works [Under](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx9zgZCMqXE&) the Hood – not the same as the above link!  Nice video providing some detail
*   Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer [Electronic](http://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) Cash System – white paper by Satoshi Nakamoto
*   Bitcoin [Architect](http://www.peakprosperity.com/podcast/82569/bitcoin-architect-everything-need-know-about-bitcoin): Everything You Need To Know About Bitcoin

Clearly due to the fact that Bitcoin is a currency (virtual), there will always be chatter on security.  Although old, [Seth](http://blogs.cisco.com/security/bitcoin-security-architecture-a-brief-overview/) provides a read on Bitcoin security.  There is also the [chargeback](http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/09/ebay_bitcoins/?repost=true) issue.

There is also the [volatility](http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/why-bitcoins-price-is-skyrocketing) aspect of [Bitcoin](http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/the-bitcoin-crash-begins), touched on by Motherboard’s article, “Why Bitcoin’s Price Is Skyrocketing”
