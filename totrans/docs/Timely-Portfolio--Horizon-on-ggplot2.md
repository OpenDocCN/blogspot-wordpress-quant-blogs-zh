# Timely Portfolio: Horizon on ggplot2

> 来源：[http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2012/08/horizon-on-ggplot2.html#0001-01-01](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2012/08/horizon-on-ggplot2.html#0001-01-01)

SocialDataBlog’s kind reference in post [Horizon plots with ggplot (not)](http://socialdatablog.com/horizon-plots-with-ggplot-not/ "http://socialdatablog.com/horizon-plots-with-ggplot-not/") motivated me to finish what the post started.  I knew that ggplot2 would be a little more difficult to use for the purpose of a [horizon plot](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/search/label/horizonplot), but I felt compelled to provide at least one example of a horizon plot for each of the major R graphing packages.  I achieved a good result but the code is not as elegant or as flexible as I would like.  Readers more comfortable with ggplot2, please bash, fork, and improve.
