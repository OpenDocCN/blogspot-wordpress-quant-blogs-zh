As global markets have been jittery on the prospect of military conflict in Ukraine,

showed a table of the regular nature of US stock market drawdowns, which is a feature of equity risk.

I am also reminded of the quip by British banker Nathan Rothchild, "Buy to the sound of cannons, sell to the sound of trumpets." As well, the trader Art Cashin also related his experience with the Cuban Missile Crisis as a young man (via

Both Rothchild's thinking and Cashin's story are lessons in market psychology and the occasional asymmetric nature of asset returns. With the angst over the FOMC decision out of the way, let's consider what might happen if war were to actually break out.
