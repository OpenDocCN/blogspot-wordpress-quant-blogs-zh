Pretty impressive. But, in order to better qualify the perf numbers, I am curious what was the Max DD since the index was started (12/18/2009) ?
I have a similar type of index which gives me 14% for the same period with a Max DD of -10% with only 5 stocks. But if I increase the position sizing, I can get to, for instance, 30% (your number) with a -15% Max drawdown (in the summer of 2010). So, I am curious about that. Also, is the index rebalanced weekly ?
A second question relates to the selection of Nasdaq 100\. Was there a particular reason to select the components of Nasdaq 100? Why not use the S&P 500 ?
Thank you!
