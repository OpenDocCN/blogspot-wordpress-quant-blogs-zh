so yesterday i had surgery on my shoulder to repair a torn labrum and rotator cuff. it is hard to do much, because i can't move my dominant arm. but what was interesting was that everyone i met when i got there, nurses 1 thru 3, anesthesiologist, etc, all asked which shoulder (right)? three people even initialed the shoulder, so we would have an evidence trail if they did the wrong one, i guess.

i told the nurse if i left with a hysterectomy, they would be in big trouble. she said if i left with a hysterectomy i would be famous.
