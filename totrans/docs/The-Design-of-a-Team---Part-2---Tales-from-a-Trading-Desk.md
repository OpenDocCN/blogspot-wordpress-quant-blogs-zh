## The Design of a Team – Part 2

Following the last posting on management, leaders and more, [Medium](http://firstround.com/article/How-Medium-is-building-a-new-kind-of-company-with-no-managers) is taking an interesting view of managers, and leveraging [Holacrazy](http://holacracy.org/), offering “clear communication, incentives, and accountability”.  The key tenants that Medium follow:

*   No people managers. Maximum autonomy.
*   Organic expansion. When a job gets too big, hire another person.
*   Tension resolution. Identify issues people are facing, write them down, and resolve them systematically.
*   Make everything explicit – from vacation policies to decision makers in each area.
*   Distribute decision-making power and discourage consensus seeking.
*   Eliminate all the extraneous factors that worry people so they can focus on work.
