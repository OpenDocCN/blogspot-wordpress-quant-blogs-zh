# VIX and More: Sentiment Failures

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/02/sentiment-failures.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/02/sentiment-failures.html#0001-01-01)

![](img/7651db1cbb6321e74f92c65313fba301.png)I am of the opinion that failures usually provide more important signals than confirmations.  For instance, if a company reports good news and sells off, then that action speaks louder than if the stock had bounced on the news (not withstanding all the “buy on the rumor, sell on the news” lore.)  The same is true for broad market data and the broader indices.  To my mind, these are fundamental failures.

There is an analogous situation with technical analysis.  A failure in this context could be a stock or index that has consistently bounced off of a particular support level that now violates that support and continues lower.  I believe that these TA failures speak volumes more in terms of informational content than if support had held for the n+1^(th) time.

Which brings us to yesterday.  Two measures in particular suggested that market sentiment was so strongly negative as to make a bounce a high probability event: the [ISEE](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/ISEE) had just hit a new low in its 20 day SMA and the [NASDAQ TRIN](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/02/bullish-nasdaq-trin-signal.html) (30 day EMA) had spiked to levels not seen since 2002.  The bottom line is that it a bounce should have been like shooting fish in a barrel for the bulls.  Since the bulls could neither hold onto their gains, nor put a dent in the selloff that ensued, I am forced to conclude that in the course of this substantial sentiment failure, they didn’t even graze any of the fish.  I am also changing my bias to bearish until the bulls can demonstrate a modicum of marksmanship…
