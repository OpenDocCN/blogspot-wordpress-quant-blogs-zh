# Humble Student of the Markets: The bulls are back in town

**Mid-week market update**

: In my last mid-week market update (see

[Still choppy, still consolidating](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2018/05/02/still-choppy-still-consolidating/)

), I highlighted the weekly (unscientific) sentiment survey conducted by Callum Thomas. The poll showed fundamentally oriented investors to be very bullish, while technical survey was bearish. I suggested at the time that one of the signs that the sideways consolidation may end was an agreement between the fundamental and technical survey, indicating either positive or negative momentum.

The

[latest survey](https://www.topdowncharts.com/single-post/2018/05/07/Sentiment-Snapshot-What-About-Reflation)

shows that such an event has occurred as technicians have flipped from bearish to bullish.

While this is not an unqualified trading buy signal, there are plenty of indications that the bulls are back in town.
