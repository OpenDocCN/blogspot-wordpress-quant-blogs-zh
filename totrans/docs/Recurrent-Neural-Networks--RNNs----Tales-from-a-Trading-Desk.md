## Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

Some while ago a data scientist colleague pointed me at “Practical Machine Learning With Event Streaming” over on the Monzo [blog](https://monzo.com/blog/2017/05/03/practical-machine-learning-for-startups/).  The key takeaway if you don’t have time to read the article fully is:

> RNNs specialise in making predictions based on a sequence of actions (known as an “event time series”), e.g. user logs in → taps on “money transfer” → encounters an error.

After reading the article, I got to wondering if you can take the event stream from the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) process and use RNNs to predict defects?
