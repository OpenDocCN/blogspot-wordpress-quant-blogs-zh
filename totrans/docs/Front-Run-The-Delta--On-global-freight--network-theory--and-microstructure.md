# Front-Run The Delta: On global freight, network theory, and microstructure

> 来源：[https://frontrunthedelta.blogspot.com/2012/07/there-is-strong-similarity-between.html#0001-01-01](https://frontrunthedelta.blogspot.com/2012/07/there-is-strong-similarity-between.html#0001-01-01)

There is a strong similarity between the microstructure of high-frequency arbitrage and the vast network of global, national, and local dry and wet freight.  ICE and

exchanges offer physical and financially settled

[freight derivatives](http://www.nosclearing.com/freight/category621.html)

to manage freight risk when operating on a global physical scale.  These forwards provide a basis for pricing physical spreads between terminals and ports. 

Cross market arbitrage uses currency as a general medium of price discovery.  Physical commodity arbitrage uses the freight market in a similar fashion. 

To illustrate the point further:

Each system contains popular or frequently traversed nodes offering price discovery - consider the relationship of CME's GC contract as the

and the pricing of

relying on that fundamental relationship.  Each system contains bottlenecks and

In the end, there is something to be learned from every network containing profit-seeking entities.
