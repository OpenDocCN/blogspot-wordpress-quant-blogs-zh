# 22hrs In New York: StreamInsight, Dryad and JFK Reading | Tales from a Trading Desk

## 22hrs In New York: StreamInsight, Dryad and JFK¬†Reading

The [Volcanic Ash](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/may/09/ash-cloud-shuts-european-airports) cloud has me delayed in [JFK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy_International_Airport) for a few hours, so its time to catch up on some emails and post of few thoughts.

It‚Äôs nice to be back in NYC, it‚Äôs been a year or so, and luckily today was pleasant from a weather perspective. Sometimes you need to do these short duration trip to help out clients ‚Äì luckily my body clock doesn‚Äôt suffer from jetlag üôÇ

Whilst in-flight I managed to do some more work on the [StreamInsight](http://www.microsoft.com/sqlserver/2008/en/us/r2-complex-event.aspx) presentation and demos for the up and coming Leveraging Technology to Drive Customer [Connections](https://msevents.microsoft.com/cui/EventDetail.aspx?culture=en-US&EventID=1032446115&IO=Y1Gb7M7t4CoDKB2h/PKaYw%3d%3d). I do think the AppFabric Caching Real-Time Market Risk demo is cool, its just unfortunate that I suspect the slides and time will not do it justice.

Dryad. I‚Äôve had the samples on my machine for about 4 weeks now, and have yet to spend enough time looking at them. Generally from the HPC work that has already been done from a Market Risk cashflow perspective, Microsoft need to spend more time in the area of scheduler performance connectivity coupled with diagnostics of understanding why a HPC SOA service is failing. On the diagnostics side of things, it‚Äôs just painful. We need a better User Experience (UX) from the developer toolset.

MSDN Magazine [May](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/magazine/ff646986.aspx) 2010 didn‚Äôt have a lot from my perspective:

*   LINQ Projection Queries and Alternatives in WCF [Services](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/magazine/ee336312.aspx)
*   Production Diagnostics [Improvements](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/magazine/ee336311.aspx) in CLR 4

And I missed this one from [April 2010](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/magazine/ee336306.aspx):

*   Entity [Framework](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/magazine/ee336128.aspx) 4.0 and WCF Data Services 4.0 in Visual Studio 2010

I need to find time to getting back to Azure. As I said in a previous posting, given the start of the various home projects, the next logic step is to move them into [Azure](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/magazine/ee336122.aspx).
