# VIX and More: But Am I Fast Enough to Play Cornerback?

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/02/but-am-i-fast-enough-to-play-cornerback.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/02/but-am-i-fast-enough-to-play-cornerback.html#0001-01-01)

Woody Allen once said, “Eighty percent of success is showing up.”

Now that *VIX and More* has been showing up for four years, this formerly [whimsical](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/lighter%20side) electronic playpen that is dedicated to tilting at statistical windmills now has all the earmarks of a veteran mainstream investment blog. I like to think I continue to straddle the fence between both worlds, but it is nice to occasionally be lumped in with some luminaries who tread down a more traditional path.

Today, for instance, Zack Miller of [New Rules of Investing](http://newrulesofinvesting.com/) is out with his [Super Bowl Team: Online Finance’s Best](http://newrulesofinvesting.com/2010/02/08/superbowl-team-online-finances-best/). The list includes some excellent bloggers, categorized according to their appropriate football position (including coaches, special teams players, a statistician, a referee and even a cheerleader), along with a brief descriptions of some of the blogging/football characteristics they bring to the game. *VIX and More* is delighted to be picked as part of the Super Bowl group, teamed up with Meb Faber (of [World Beta](http://www.mebanefaber.com/)) and James Altucher (of [Stockpickr](http://www.stockpickr.com/) and seemingly many other places) as defensive backs.

Miller describes the trio as follows:

> *“These guys are quick, some of the best athletes on the field. Most importantly, they need to be able to cover the offense deep over the air while being strong/aggressive enough to step up and make a play on the ground.”*

There are some excellent blogs on this group and I am honored to be mentioned in their company.

For the record, VIX and More has been mentioned on several all-star blogging teams in the past. Five
