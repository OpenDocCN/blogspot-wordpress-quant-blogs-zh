# Humble Student of the Markets: Bond market panic!

**Mid-week market update**

: Is the bond market panic over yet? The 10-year Treasury yield touched a high of 1.6% last week. It fell when the Reserve Bank of Australia began to engage in yield curve control, but it is edging back towards 1.5% again.

Based on this week's market action, I conclude that stock prices have unfinished business, both on the upside and downside.
