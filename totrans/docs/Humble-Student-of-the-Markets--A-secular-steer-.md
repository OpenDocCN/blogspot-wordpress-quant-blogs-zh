# Humble Student of the Markets: A secular steer?

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2014/03/a-secular-steer.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2014/03/a-secular-steer.html#0001-01-01)

This is another post in the series about the question of whether we are experiencing a brand new secular bull market before (see my previous post 

[New all-time highs = Secular bull?](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2014/03/new-all-time-highs-secular-bull-market.html)

).

**P/E are elevated**

The struggle I've had is that secular bulls typically don't start at the kinds of elevated valuation levels. Here is a chart of SP 500 P/E ratios from

[Chart of the Day](http://www.chartoftheday.com/20140319.htm)

that goes back to the start of the 20th Century. Note that P/E ratios are at the top of their historical range, especially if we were to exclude the anomalous episodes of the Tech Bubble period and the Lehman Crisis.

In short, P/E ratios are elevated today. They aren't stupidly high, but there is no question that they are above average. As another point of reference, James Montier of GMO (via

[Zero Hedge](http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-03-21/james-montier-market-overvalued-50-70-and-nothing-all-attractively-valued)

) believes that the stock market is 50-70% overvalued. A 50-70% adjustment would put the P/E ratio in the low teens - which is roughly in the middle of the historical range.

What about interest rates? The inverse of P/E is E/P, or earnings yield, which should be compared to the prevailing interest rates of the time. (This approach, by the way, forms the theoretical basis for the so-called Fed Model.) Here is a chart of 10-year Treasury yields going back to 1918, courtesy of

[Global Financial Data](https://www.globalfinancialdata.com/index.html)

. The other comparable episode of low bond yields occurred during the period from the late 1930's to the mid-1950's.

**10 year Treasury yields**

**The late 1930's to early 1950's analogue**

Now look at this long term chart of the Dow. The stock market was range bound for most of that period until a new secular bull was launched about 1952:

**Dow Jones Industrial Average**

Here's my problem. The early 1950's were marked by extremely low P/E ratios in the single digit range, while today we are seeing P/Es in the high teens. The early 1950's was marked by a low interest rate regime, just as we have today.

***If this is truly the start of a new secular bull, how can we expect stock market gains that are typically seen in past episodes?***

In my last

on this topic, I wrote:

> When he puts it all together, my inner investor thinks that, if we are indeed seeing a new secular bull market, the extraordinary measures undertaken by global central banks in the wake of the Lehman Crisis has front-end loaded many of the gains to be realized in this bull.

True, the major averages have convincingly broken out to new all-time highs and it looks like a secular bull from a technician's viewpoint. However, valuation analysis suggests that this market is unlikely to see the same kinds of gains.

This market isn't a bull. It is, at best, a secular steer.
