# Humble Student of the Markets: Where's the fear?

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2021/05/wheres-fear.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2021/05/wheres-fear.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models** 

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post, 

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The 

**Trend Asset Allocation Model**

 is an asset allocation model that applies trend following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. The performance and full details of a model portfolio based on the out-of-sample signals of the Trend Model can be found

My inner trader uses a 

**trading model**

, which is a blend of price momentum (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa). Subscribers receive real-time alerts of model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of the email alerts is updated weekly

. The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that began in March 2016 is shown below.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Buy equities*
*   Trend Model signal: Bullish*
*   Trading model: Neutral*

: I generally update model readings on my

**A lack of panic**

The stock market tumbled last Wednesday on inflation fears from an unexpected "hot" CPI report. It became oversold and rebounded. That bottom seemed a little too easy. The nagging question is, "Where's the fear?"

While a number of technical indicators became oversold, sentiment models did not show any signs of panic or the sort of seller capitulation usually found at bottoms.
