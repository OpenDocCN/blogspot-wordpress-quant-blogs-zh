Happy New Year to all the viewers of this blog and just a short reminder that the course will be available again this January.

Having audited the course, I would highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in a very hands on learning session covering many of the topics I've posted about (and many other areas, such as how to deal with over/under fitting). Kudos to Dr. Ng for a fantastic, engaging, and informative course.

As an added incentive, users will become familiarized with many vectorized approaches to programming (via Octave), which are very useful in languages such as Python and R.
