## Finexpo 2006

[Finexpo 2006](http://www.finexpo.com/) click off today, with Microsoft presenting a [seminar](http://www.finexpo.com/cts/seminar.asp?s_id=76) on Excel 12 :). Hopefully [John](http://beingextreme.blogspot.com/) will blog his view of the conference sometime this week.

I see quite a few of the [“players”](http://www.finexpo.com/cts/seminar_list.asp) are presenting at the conference.
