# Scrum and Money | Tales from a Trading Desk

## Scrum and Money

Classic [presentation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hG4LH6P8Syk) from Robert C Martin – The Land that Scrum Forgot.  Check out 19:32 🙂 Certification is silly, due to PM’s taking the certifications.  Software engineering practices 25:00 – stop the rotting!  32:50, and again 36:00 – lack of test driven development – shocking, and worrying 😦 Manual testing – 37:10 – just classic and true comments.

Uncle Bob explains the issues with Scrum, and the lack of understanding of basic software engineering principles.
