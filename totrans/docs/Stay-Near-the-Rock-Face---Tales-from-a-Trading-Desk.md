## Stay Near the Rock Face

The further one moves away from the rock face, the less one understands the real issues on the ground.  What I mean by this is that if your in the business of software engineering, the higher you are in the management stack, and the more distance you are from the code, the product, the support, etc, the large the delta you may have in decisions being made that are the wrong decisions.  Girish Mathrubootham over on [TNW](http://thenextweb.com/entrepreneur/2014/05/04/3-reasons-every-ceo-spend-time-customer-support/) offers a view from Freshdesk on why the CEO should do support, and reading between the lines, why the CTO should still code!
