## Caplin Chrome

### September 9, 2008

I’ve installed [Google](http://www.google.com)‘s new browser [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome) on my Vye S37 at home. While my Vye runs Vista, it doesn’t have Office installed. Instead I use [EditGrid](http://www.editgrid.com) and [Google docs](http://docs.google.com) from IE7\. My CPU is often maxed out, despite IE being the only app running. I guessed that all JavaScript running in the browser was hammering the CPU, so I gave Chrome a spin. It’s fast, and CPU loading is way down. Thank you Google Chrome – you breathed life into Vista for me !

So the obvious question is, what will Chrome do for [Caplin Trader](http://www.caplin.com/caplintrader/)‘s JavaScript ?  Alas, my employer won’t let me find out, as the InfoSec guys have barred access to the Chrome download. Running Chrome is verboten, and delinquent developers have already been warned… It would be good to see some commentary over at [CometDaily](http://cometdaily.com). Perhaps [Martin](http://cometdaily.com/people/martin_tyler/) could run his [grid benchmark](http://cometdaily.com/2008/08/28/grid-performance-round-2/) in Chrome.
