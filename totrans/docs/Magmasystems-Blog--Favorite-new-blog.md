# Magmasystems Blog: Favorite new blog

A lot of good stuff on implementing HPC within financial services firms.

The author of the blog just took a job with 29West in London, the makers of LBM (Wombat is a big user of LBM). He regularly hosts drinking sessions in London with interesting guest speakers.

(Since I showed Terry the blog, he has already found more reasons to stay late at work. Sorry, mate!)
