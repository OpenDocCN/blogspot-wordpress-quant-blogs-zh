# Falkenblog: Refinement to The Neg

> 来源：[http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2012/01/refinement-to-neg.html#0001-01-01](http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2012/01/refinement-to-neg.html#0001-01-01)

Tucker Max is a populizer of

[The Neg](http://trueslant.com/conorfriedersdorf/2009/07/22/some-i-insult-some-i-let-go/)

, a technique whereby men strategically criticize women they're attempting to pickup. The idea is that by doing so you signal deep confidence from your high status, which makes you look more attractive, or at least makes a woman rethink blowing you off. It is intriguing, and I

how Asian guys are picking this up to counteract their more restrained demeanor.

Interestingly, I read an

[interview with Tucker Max](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/beautiful-minds/201107/conversations-creativity-tucker-max)

over at Psychology Today, and he specifically mentioned several influences that I also quite like to read:

[Geoffrey Miller](http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2009/05/beware-liberal-scientists.html)

(author of Spent), and

[Robin Hanson](http://www.overcomingbias.com/)

(blogs at Overcoming Bias), and the interviewer mentioned

[Robert Kurzban](http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2011/07/why-everyone-else-is-biased.html)

(author of Why Everyone Else is a Hypocrite). I guess there's a confluence of ideas here that appeals to those with all sorts of angles.

But as to The Neg itself, it seems there's a potential refinement that may take your game to the next level. It's called, 'the pratfall', and involves making a clumsy blunder after establishing your awesomeness. For example, after slyly dissing your target of affection by noting her lipstick is smeared, you sink the hook by secretly shaking up a can of soda and then have it 'accidentally' blast you in the face in front of her. Oh my! I'm so clumsy!

Here's Yale psychologist Peter Salovey on how it works (info needs only first 5 from where this starts). This is within a Yale Intro Psychology Lecture on Love.
