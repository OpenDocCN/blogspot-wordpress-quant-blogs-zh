# VIX and More: Sitting in for Steven Sears at Barron’s Today

Today I am the guest columnist of *The Striking Price* at [Barron’s](http://online.barrons.com/), sitting in for Steven Sears.

In [Will Market Volatility Return to Crisis Levels?](http://online.barrons.com/article/SB50001424052970204297404575493863568455090.html) I took the opportunity to expand upon some recent themes, notably the record [contango](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/contango) in the [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures) [term structure](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/term%20structure) as indicated by the new all-time highs in the [VIX Futures Contango Index](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20Futures%20Contango%20Index), etc.

The Barron’s article talks about some of the mathematical implications of an elevated VIX, puts some important numbers in historical context, and offers some thoughts on the implications for trading approaches.
