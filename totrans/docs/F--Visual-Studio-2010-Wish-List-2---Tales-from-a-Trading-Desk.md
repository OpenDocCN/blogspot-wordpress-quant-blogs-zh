# F# Visual Studio 2010 Wish List 2 | Tales from a Trading Desk

## F# Visual Studio 2010 Wish List 2

Following on from the previous F# posting:

*   Ability to have F# and C# source files in a single project
*   Today I’m not overly concerned about WPF/WinForm support for F# in VS

I recently got contacted by the Group Program Manager for C# in the Visual Studio product team who’s role is to drive the planning and design process for C# (and now also F#). Hopefully these blog postings and general input from the F# community will help to transform F# into a real product and provide fully integrate into Visual Studio with the same quality and support obligations Microsoft has with other languages.
