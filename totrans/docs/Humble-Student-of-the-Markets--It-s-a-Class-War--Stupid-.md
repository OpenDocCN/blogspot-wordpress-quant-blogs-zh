# Humble Student of the Markets: It's a Class War, Stupid!

There have been a lot of instant analysis of the Tucson shooting that occurred over the weekend. Some have characterized the gunman as a "whack job" and pointed out his

, others have viewed it through a

 and blamed the hate mongers and their enablers on the Right.

**The Class War begins?**

I believe that the causes are more fundamental: It's the Class War. The chart below from

[Economix](http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/07/comparing-recoveries-job-changes-2/)

shows the pace of job recovery in the United States of this cycle compared to past cycles. Analysts have described this recovery as tepid, but "tepid" doesn't even begin to fully characterize this upturn.

I have also written before about the risks in the rising gap between rich and poor. The chart below from the

[OECD](http://www.economist.com/world/britain/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12480828)

relates the Gini coefficient, as a measure of income disparity, to social mobility. The US has a high level of income disparity but also a low level of social mobility, indicating that the "American Dream" is just that - a dream.

Now the chickens are coming home to roost. Consider this chart of the uneven recovery. Wall Street (the elite) wins and Main Street (everyone else) loses.

Despite last week's Non-Farm Payroll gain of 103K jobs, look at the participation rate showing how discouraged workers have quit the workforce:

As the "recovery" continues and the vast majority of the population doesn't get its share, is it any wonder that people are getting cranky?

We may blame this specific shooting on the crazies on the Right, along with the Libertarians and the Tea Partiers. As the fruits of this recovery gets more and more uneven and we have to deal with the fallout (examples

and

), don't be surprised if there is a reaction from the Left in the not too distant future.

We used to call that "going Postal". I call this the first shot in a Class War.
