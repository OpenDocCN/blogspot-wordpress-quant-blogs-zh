# Quantifiable Edges: Option Claus

> 来源：[http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2008/12/option-claus.html#0001-01-01](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2008/12/option-claus.html#0001-01-01)

No doubt traders will hear about a possible “Santa Claus Rally” many times in the next few weeks. When looking at the S&P 500, though, I found the best week in December to be option expirations week. The edge has been especially pronounced over the last 24 years. During that period the market has closed the week higher about 81% of the time.
