# Managing Humans | Tales from a Trading Desk

## Managing Humans

I recently read [Managing Humans](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Managing-Humans-Humorous-Software-Engineering/dp/1430243147).  Although classified as semi-fiction, with the names of people all fake, I can only imagine that correlation is high to real events, with anyone who has worked with Rands over the years being able to identify who/what/when from the book 🙂   I suspect many of us have considered writing such a book 🙂

Here are just a few classic extracts from the book that can liven up your day of “management” madness

*   Page 5, the all hands meeting run by the CEO that really doesn’t make a connection with the staff
*   Page 8, understand your manager, and what makes him tick 😉
*   Page 10, an utter classic in my view.  The manager who doesn’t understand what you do, and isn’t an engineer.
*   Page 18, Rands Test, 11 possible points
*   Chapter 4 – How to run a meeting. Essentially, agenda and referee
*   Page 58, Classify the Participants. Although obvious, its worrying how many people don’t get this concept.  Pawns and Players – which are you?
*   Page 76,  Management is chess – enough said!.  Understand the consequences, make the decision, move.  If you are not in this game, your in the wrong game.  Have an “edge”, and understand what “execute” (move) means.
*   Chapter 15, great engineers are often promoted to leadership for their hard work.  While many succeed, and equal part fails because the skills required to lead are vastly different than the ones required to be an engineer.
*   Page 99, advice for maintaining an engineering mindset.  I for one have pretty much adhered to this view for the entire history of having direct reports.  Enough said
*   Page 101, remember what it means to be an engineer.  A chap once told me that since he had moved to a management position, he was no longer an engineer.  😦  I was disappointed with the comment
*   Page 113, make great decisions, and take responsibility for those decisions.
*   Chapter 19, as a software developer, you are going to get screwed at some point – very true, and not just once.
*   Page 119, Rands 1.0 Hierarchy.  Some great commentary here, including faking done.
*   Chapter 21, Time to Think.  Like to commentary on Google 20%, page 138.  Its a numbers game of thinking and bumping into stuff.
*   Chapter 26, When the sky falls 🙂  War room,  Think we’ve all been there a few times on this.
*   Page 167, Hacking is important. High-impact, fast-moving and bold barbarian.  Game on.
*   Page 172, Bored people quit – very true!
*   Chapter 34, meeting creatures.  Some gems in here – Mr Irrelevant, and The Snake.
*   Chapter 39, rules for he reorg.
*   Chapter 44, resignation check-list.  Rule #4 is mandatory in my view.  Rule #6 is just madness to even consider.

Net out, worth a read.  Some good pointers, but take them in your context, quoting the book is so not the right thing to do as a leader
