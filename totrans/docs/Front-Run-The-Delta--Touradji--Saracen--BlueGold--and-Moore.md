> Peak Ridge Commodity Volatility Fund in Boston, advised by Hunter, the former Amaranth Advisors LLC energy trader, returned about 24 percent, leaving it up at least 230 percent this year, according to an investor.

Not a bad return. Just goes to show that you can get back into the game, even after losing $6.6 billion on the H/J spread.

> Saracen Energy Partners LP, a Houston-based energy fund, gained about 3 percent in July, trimming its loss this year to about 29 percent, according to two investors. The fund, run by [Neil Kelley](http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Neil+Kelley&site=wnews&client=wnews&proxystylesheet=wnews&output=xml_no_dtd&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&filter=p&getfields=wnnis&sort=date:D:S:d1), 49, had lost 22 percent in February alone.

Not bad, considering they nearly blew up several months ago.

> Traders that lost money last month included BlueGold Capital Management LLP, a $800 million fund co-founded in February by 31-year-old [Pierre Andurand](http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Pierre+Andurand&site=wnews&client=wnews&proxystylesheet=wnews&output=xml_no_dtd&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&filter=p&getfields=wnnis&sort=date:D:S:d1) in London. The fund declined about 19 percent in July, paring its return this year to 109 percent, according to investors.

> Clive has been one of the largest players in crude oil options the last few quarters, primarily trading the June and December expirations.

> I'm surprised BP Capital and Citadel were not mentioned in that article. I was hearing last week that they were both getting hit pretty hard by the fall in natty and CL. Apparently Boone has been buying front on the way down, and Citadel has been bidding CL puts, so will be interesting to see where they stand in next few months.
