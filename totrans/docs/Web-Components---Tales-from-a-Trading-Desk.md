## Web Components

Axel [Rauschmayer](http://www.2ality.com/2013/05/google-polymer.html) hits the [nail](http://www.infoq.com/news/2013/05/webcomponents) on the head regards framework madness:

> A rich set of widgets. In my opinion, this is the biggest deal about Web [Components](http://www.w3.org/TR/components-intro/) (and, to a lesser degree, about Polymer). We finally get a large set of widgets that we can use anywhere.

Finally, we could get to a decent set of financial [widget](https://developers.google.com/events/io/sessions/318907648) for building Single Dealer Platforms (SDP) e.g. a currency pair web component (Shadow DOM, <template>, custom elements, MDV, new CSS primitives)
