# Humble Student of the Markets: A simple decision vs. a decision process

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2019/01/a-simple-decision-vs-decision-process.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2019/01/a-simple-decision-vs-decision-process.html#0001-01-01)

I got some pushback from a reader to my weekend post (see

[How to spot the bear market bottom](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2018/12/30/how-to-spot-the-bear-market-bottom/)

) about the

[FT Alphaville](https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2018/12/24/1545650804000/There-s-no-process-left-at-the-White-House/)

article indicating that former Secretary of Defense Mattis raised concerns about how the White House lacked a decision making process. The reader went on to defend Trump's decisions.

I try very hard to remain apolitical on this site. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but there is a distinction between a decision, and a process. Here is an example from the investment realm. Josh Brown recently ranted about people "who called the correction". Click

Josh Brown's main complaints can be summarized as:

*   **Anyone can make a market call.** If you are wrong, very few people will remember, or you can delete your articles or tweets.
*   **Managing a portfolio is a much tougher task**. Portfolio managers are measured by actual returns. As an example, if you decide to sell out, what is your discipline for buying back in?
*   **Just because someone doesn't say anything, it doesn't mean that they are unprepared for market volatility**. Most firms have compliance guidelines about what individual portfolio managers or advisors can or cannot say or publish. 

Despite my own efforts at transparency (see

[A 2018 report card](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2018/12/26/a-2018-report-card/)

) where I have published my track record, and owned up to bad calls, I sympathize with Brown. Josh Brown's rant amounts to distinguishing a decision (market call) to an investment process. A timely market call means little if there is no investment process behind it.

**A Special Announcement**

We told you so. We told you the market was going down.

Here is the track of

***Humble Student of the Markets***

, where we are neither perma-bulls nor perma-bears. Most recently, we have been correctly bullish since the correction of 2015, and turned cautious in August 2018 (see

[Market top ahead? My inner investor turns cautious,](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2018/08/05/major-top-ahead-my-inner-investor-turns-cautious/)

August 5, 2018).

We were also timely at the 2009 bottom. We issued a call to buy beaten up low-priced stocks with high insider buying a week before the ultimate bottom (see

[Phoenix rising?](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2009/02/phoenix-rising.html)

 February 24, 2009).

***The out-of-sample record of our model trading portfolio in 2018 was up 42.9%***
