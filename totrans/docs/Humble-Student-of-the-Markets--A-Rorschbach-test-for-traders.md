# Humble Student of the Markets: A Rorschbach test for traders

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2011/09/rorschbach-test-for-traders.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2011/09/rorschbach-test-for-traders.html#0001-01-01)

The

[Rorschbach](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rorschach_test)

inkblot test was supposedly an interesting psychological test. You looked at an inkblot and what you saw said more about the you than the inkblot.

Here is an interesting test for both bulls and bears. On Monday, US equities rallied in the last hour on reports from various media outlets that the Italians were in serious discussions with the Chinese about buying Italian debt. Here is the original report from the

[FT](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/90c4c7f6-dd54-11e0-9dac-00144feabdc0.html)

and another from the

[WSJ](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903532804576567122755937658.html)

.

For the bulls who are ready to jump in on the long side on this news, consider the following trade as a test of your resolve.

The SNB has indicated its willingness to defend the CHFEUR exchange rate to prevent the Swiss Franc from rising any further against the euro. In effect,

***the SNB has become the liquidity provider of last resort to the eurozone***

. Given the combination of Swiss resolve and the news of a possible Chinese rescue of Italy, why not put on the long Italy/short Switzerland carry trade?

[Two-year Italian paper](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=GBTPGR2:IND)

is yielding roughly 4.5%:

**Italian Bonds - 2 year gross yield**

...while

[Swiss two-year paper](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=GSWISS02:IND)

is yielding a measly 6 basis points - effectively zero:

**Swiss Government Bond generic 2-year Note bid yield**

Imagine you're a hedge fund. Buy Italy and short Switzerland. Lever the trade up 10x or 20x. Think of your return!

If you're truly bullish and believe that this represents the turning point, then would you put on that trade? Underlying that assumption is that, even if Greece defaults, any contagion would be contained before it reaches Italy.

Of course, there is the contention from

[ZeroHedge](http://www.zerohedge.com/news/reminder-here-what-china-really-thinks-about-italian-bond-purchases)

(which has always a bearish bias) that Asians are reluctant to buy Italian bonds because if the ECB won't buy it, why should they?

> On one hand we have FT "reporting" about Chinese Italian bond purchasing ambitions citing "unidentified Italian officials" one day ahead of a major Italian bond auction (wink wink nudge nudge). On the other hand, we have Reuters, citing a real live Italian Finance Minister (though not for long) Giulio Tremonti, who tells us a slightly different story, which, gasp, cites real live people: "***Italian Economy Minister Giulio Tremonti said on Thursday that Asian investors are reluctant to buy Italian bonds because it sees they are not being bought by the European Central Bank.***"

For the bulls, the answer is, "It doesn't matter what the ECB does. The SNB stands ready to provide oodles of euro liquidity to the market."

For the bears, there is that minor item in the WSJ article stating that CIC has $200 billion in reserves. Assuming that only a small fraction of the $200 billion goes into Italian bonds, will it be enough?

Where do you stand?

***Disclaimer***

: I am not advocating that you take any position in the long Italy/short Swiss trade. It's just a way of getting you to think through the implications of these latest developments.
