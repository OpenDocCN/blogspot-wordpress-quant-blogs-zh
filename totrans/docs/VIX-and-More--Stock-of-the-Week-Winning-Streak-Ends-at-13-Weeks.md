# VIX and More: Stock of the Week Winning Streak Ends at 13 Weeks

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/06/stock-of-week-winning-streak-ends-at-13.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/06/stock-of-week-winning-streak-ends-at-13.html#0001-01-01)

It was a fun ride while it lasted, but the [Stock of the Week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/stock%20of%20the%20week) (SOTW) winning streak finally came to an end last week, after 13 consecutive weekly winning selections. In the end, it was a scant 0.14 weekly decline in LSB Industries ([LXU](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/LXU)) that brought an end to the ride, but even with that loss, the SOTW ‘Sequential Portfolio’ is still up 136.9% so far for 2009 and a gravity-defying 368.4% in the 14 ½ months since I introduced that feature as a part of my [subscriber newsletter](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/subscriber%20newsletter).

For anyone who is interested, I will update the performance of the SOTW in another two weeks and at the end of each quarter on the [VIX and More Subscriber Blog](http://vixandmoresubscriber.blogspot.com/).
