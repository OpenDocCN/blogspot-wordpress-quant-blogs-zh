## Server Solutions(Technical Computing) – 2011 Microsoft MVP!

After getting my first MVP some years back and then being dropped due to not meeting the “community criteria”, I finally [received](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/mvpawardprogram/archive/2011/06/29/congratulations-to-the-new-and-re-awarded-microsoft-mvps.aspx) a second MVP [award](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/mvpawardprogram/) (2011). Thanks to all
