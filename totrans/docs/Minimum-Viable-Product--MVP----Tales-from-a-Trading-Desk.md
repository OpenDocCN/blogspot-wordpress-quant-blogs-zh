## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

Jon Pittman’s “The Tyranny of the Minimum Viable Product” posting offers an interesting [read](https://medium.com/@jonhpittman/the-tyranny-of-the-minimum-viable-product-fb25e2e57e6e) on a subject that is often difficult when a stakeholder is asked to define the features of an MVP for a new product.

> The intent behind the MVP idea is to minimize wasted effort and risk — to focus the product on only the key elements that will capture the imagination of early customers, let them understand the vision and direction, and see the product as an early demonstration of that vision.

Unfortunately, the devil is in the detail.  Stakeholders often get lost in the world of features, and before you know it, the MVP has n features, and n years of development to achieve MVP readiness.
