# VIX and More: VIX Spikes Over 50 as SPX Drops Below 800

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/02/vix-spikes-over-50-as-spx-drops-below.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/02/vix-spikes-over-50-as-spx-drops-below.html#0001-01-01)

 *VIX at 50.04 with SPX at 798.

The VIX hasn’t been over 50 since January 23^(rd).

It will be interesting to see what the SPX does for support today now that the 800 level is taken out.

Internally, the financials are the main culprit in the early going, as technology and small cap stocks have already started to rally.*
