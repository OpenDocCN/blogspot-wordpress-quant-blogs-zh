## The Gulf Between Architecture and Implementation Ontologies – Part 2

Continuing on with the second book, Documenting Software Architecture: Views and Beyond:

*   Page 6 – the difference between Design and Architecture.
*   Page 12 – Audiences for Architecture Documentation: Education, Stakeholder communication, System Analysis and Construction
*   Page 20 speak to an Agile environment then considering Views and Beyond.  Its unfortunate that page 17 “Mapping to requirements” didn’t provide a means of mapping architecture to stories.
*   Page 32 Architecture Style and Architecture Patterns.
*   Page 36 Seven Rules for Sound Documentation 🙂
*   Page 49 Three categories of style: module, component-and-connector, allocation
*   Page 191 Deployment Style – often left to late in the architectural process 😦
*   Page 239 Documenting Architectural Decisions.  Audit trail is worth while!
*   Page 289 Documenting Behaviour – Communication Diagram etc. are all good.  Shame there way no linkage to BDD in this chapter
*   Page 364 Building an Architecture Overview Presentation.
*   Page 382 Sample Question Sets for Reviewing the Architecture Document
