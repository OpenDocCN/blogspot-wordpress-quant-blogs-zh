## “As a developer..” I want to waste as much time on-boarding new developers to my project

I don’t get the mentality of forcing new developers to incur time and effort to join a project and get productive.  Over the years, some of the worst on-boarding experiences I’ve seen have run for a duration of 3 days, and highlighted flaws in process/procedures and wiki notes. Its in some ways shocking, and shows in my view a lack of due care and attention to detail, let alone the hit taken on the team themselves to assist any new team member.  Further, just the hit in terms of velocity probably hasn’t been considered, and thus cost.

The first 4 mins or so of “From Local Docker [Development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CZFpHUPqXw) to Production Deployments” should aid in setting the bar for getting a development environment up and running.
