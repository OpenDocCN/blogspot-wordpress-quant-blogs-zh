# Magmasystems Blog: Review of the Gartner 2008 Conference on Event Processing

> 来源：[http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2008/09/review-of-gartner-2008-conference-on.html#0001-01-01](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2008/09/review-of-gartner-2008-conference-on.html#0001-01-01)

I spent an interesting two days in scenic Stamford, Connecticut on September 15 and 16, 2008\. It was my second venture to a

Gartner

conference solely devoted to event processing, the first being in Orlando in 2007 when we were

CEP

neophytes. This time, I was not in learning mode .... the sessions that I attended were designed to give me an insight into what other financial companies are doing with

CEP

, and what the future direction of

CEP

might be.

The conference seemed a bit smaller than last year's conference, maybe because this year, it was not preceded directly by the

Gartner

conference on Business Intelligence. Some of the vendors were lamenting the lack of prospects. Indeed, the conference seemed much more heavily stacked with vendor participants than with potential customers. This speculation was confirmed when I saw a list of the attendees. I would estimate that, out of about 200 attendees, maybe 2o-25% were customers. I was one of 9 attendees from financial services firms, with most of the other attendees coming from fairly small companies. Does this mean that financial companies have already made their decisions concerning

CEP

, or are the financial companies being more prudent with their spending on conferences and travel? The next year should be a very interesting one for the vendors of

CEP

products, especially ones that are

targeting

financial firms.

Mary Knox started off with her usually overview of adopting

CEP

in financial services. A fairly good overview, with many valid points. I also notice that Mary has been reading certain blogs, as some of this information was included in her presentation. I questioned Mary's numbers on

CEP

spending, as it showed an extremely rosy outlook for the

CEP

marketplace, an outlook which may have been valid at last year's conference, but may no longer be valid in these times.

Mark Palmer of

Streambase

gave a great presentation on Smart Order Routing. I feared that it was going to be an

informercial

for

Streambase

, especially since, as I walked into the conference room, a

Streambase

rep

thrust

a

USB

flash drive at me which contained the latest incarnation of the

Streambase

platform. However, Mark presented a very good presentation without really harping on

Streambase

, and to tell you the truth, I like the direction where they are heading. It's pretty obvious that Mark is bringing a lot of the direction from

Apama

to

Streambase

in terms of developing financial verticals. I also hope that Mark will have a positive effect on the

Streambase

culture, and that their sales and marketing team will adopt a lower-key approach.

Mark's presentation was followed by Robert

Almgren

, who used to be with Bank of America before striking out on his own (???). Last year, Robert gave a fascinating intro to

Algo

trading. This year, he gave some in-depth looks at the architecture of an

algo

trading system, something that he was probably not allowed to do last year.

Streambase

is sponsoring some work that he and Bill Harts are doing in Smart Order Routing, and I am sure that the results will make their way back into the

Streambase

platform.

Streambase's

direction of totally embracing the financial services industry may or may not pay off in the future; from what a few of the vendors have told me, the interest in

CEP

in the hedge fund sector has cooled off somewhat.

Louis Morgan from HG Trading pretty much rehashed last year's presentation. HG Trading specializes in High Frequency Trading. Their average holding time for a stock is 7 minutes, and they never hold a position overnight. He mentioned that trading volume have gone up substantially, while the latency of his system has gone from 20ms to under 2ms. HG trading is a three person shop .... Lou, his developer, and a

quant

. They are extremely agile, and not afraid to spend money where it is needed. For instance, they spend money on co-location for their servers. They have 6

Apama correlators

running. It was interesting that Lou gave his talk around the time the market opened on Monday (the morning of the Merrill and Lehman

announcements

), and he would have been totally forgiven if he has to cancel his presentation and attend to business.

Another good talk with given by Albert Doolittle of George Weiss, a small trading firm in Hartford, Connecticut. I saw many parallels between Albert's experience and my own .... he just jumped into

CEP

last year, did the trade show circuit, picked

Aleri

, did a

POC

, and now he has a

CEP

system up and running.

I think that my own talk went fairly well, and that I save the attendees some things to ponder.

It was nice to see some of the luminaries of the

CEP

world, including

Opher

, and to reconnect with many of the

CEP

vendors. Ron from

Aleri

introduced me to the Black Martini (Vodka, Blue Curacao, and

Chamborde

), and I know that he was moving a few steps slower the following morning.
