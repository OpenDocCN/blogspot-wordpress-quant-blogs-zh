## Decomposing User Stories

Mike has a must-read on [decomposing](http://mkuphal.wordpress.com/2011/05/13/agile-planning-my-top-five-tips-on-decomposing-user-stories-into-tasks/) stories into task.  Software engineers are all to often diving into the widget/component tasks, and no functional tasks to ensure delivery of the overriding story.  I’d also add the following:

*   If a story feels like an Epic, then break it into stories.
*   Decomposing a story into tasks should only occur once the story is really a story, and not an epic
*   The agile road requires everyone involved to embrace change.
*   Time-box the game planning, else it will run and run 😦
*   Stop the client/server split – you’ll get completely disconnected deliverables otherwise
*   Leverage Tracer Bullet’s as appropriate– very narrow [implementation](http://www.gettingagile.com/2007/10/22/research-spikes-tracer-bullets-oh-my/) in production quality of an epic/large user story – indicator: user story is too large in estimation
