# LiquidityFX – Following The Market | Tales from a Trading Desk

## LiquidityFX – Following The Market

smartTrade’s press [release](http://low-latency.com/article/smarttrade-technologies-announces-new-components-liquidityfx) on [LiquidityFX](http://www.smart-trade.net/liquidity-FX.html) highlights one of the key drivers in the FX space over the last time period – “regional financial institutions”.  I suspect smartTrade is not talking Tier-1 banks here 🙂 , but the smaller tier 2 and 3 banks, who’s customer based is obviously different to the major players, and ripe for electronic trading improvements.  From a technology perspective, it would be interesting to know what percentage of the overall regional financial institution market opts for hosted/managed solution (aka cloud) vs software package (self install) vs appliance.   I recall [Kaazing](http://kaazing.com/) used to offer an appliance, but due to demand I believe it was discontinued.  However, in the case of smartTrade, given the larger product offering they provide, and knowing the tier 2/3 market a little 😉 , an appliance may have a better take up.
