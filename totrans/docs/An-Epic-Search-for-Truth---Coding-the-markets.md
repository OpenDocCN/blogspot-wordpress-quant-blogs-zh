## An Epic Search for Truth

### January 11, 2010

A little off topic, but not too far, as this is all relevant to the foundations of computing. I just finished reading [Logicomix: An Epic Search for Truth](http://www.logicomix.com/en/), a graphic novel on the quest for the foundations of maths. While [Russell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell) is the central character, all the usual suspects appear including [Frege](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frege), [Godel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godel) and [Wittgenstein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wittgenstein). The novel explains how Godel’s Theorem ended the quest in failure. But far from total failure, since the work of Russell, Godel and Hilbert provided the platform for [Turing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing) and [Von Neumann](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann), the creators of computing as we know it today. Toward the end it’s hinted that the authors may produce a sequel focusing on Turing, Von Neumann and computing. I hope they do, since they’ve made some very difficult material very accessible. Strongly recommended…
