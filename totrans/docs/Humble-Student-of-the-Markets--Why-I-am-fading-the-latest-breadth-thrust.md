# Humble Student of the Markets: Why I am fading the latest breadth thrust

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2023/04/why-i-am-fading-latest-breadth-thrust.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2023/04/why-i-am-fading-latest-breadth-thrust.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models** 

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post, 

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The 

**Trend Asset Allocation Model**

 is an asset allocation model that applies trend-following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity prices. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. The performance and full details of a model portfolio based on the out-of-sample signals of the Trend Model can be found

[here](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/trend-model-report-card/)

.

My inner trader uses a 

**trading model**

, which is a blend of price momentum (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa). Subscribers receive real-time alerts of model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of the email alerts is updated weekly 

[here](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/trading-track-record/)

. The hypothetical trading record of the trading 

model of the real-time alerts that began in March 2016 is shown below.

 The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Sell equities*
*   Trend Model signal: Neutral*
*   Trading model: Neutral*

** The performance chart and model readings have been delayed by a week out of respect to our paying subscribers.***Update schedule**

: I generally update model readings on my 

[site](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/)

 on weekends. I am also on Twitter at @humblestudent and on Mastodon at @humblestudent@toot.community. Subscribers receive real-time alerts of trading model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of those email alerts is shown

**About that breadth thrust**

I have had several discussions with investors over the meaning of the recent Zweig Breadth Thrust (see Interpreting the

[Zweig Breadth Thrust Buy Signa](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2023/04/02/interpreting-the-zweig-breadth-thrust-buy-signal/)

l). A ZBT is a rare condition that occurs when the market moves from an oversold to an overbought condition within 10 trading days. There have been seven out-of-sample signals since Marty Zweig wrote his book,

*Winning on Wall Street*

. The stock market was higher a year later in every instance, though it did pause and pull back on two occasions, which occurred against Fed tightening cycles. I think that the latest signal will resolve in a pullback.
