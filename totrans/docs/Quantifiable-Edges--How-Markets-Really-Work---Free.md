I've had the pleasure of doing some work with and for Larry Connors. His ideas have inspired a good amount of the work I've done over the last several years. I've mentioned before his book "How Markets Really Work", which has many interesting facts and observations in it. When I went to the TradingMarkets site today I noticed they were allowing free downloads of the book until Monday night. I'd highly recommend people download and read it. Here's the link:
