## Reactive Synchronization

Having been involved in numerous distributed system over n years, it interesting to read Rylan’s [article](http://blog.8thlight.com/rylan-dirksen/2013/10/04/synchronization-in-a-distributed-system.html) on “Synchronization in a Distributed System” followed by a re-reading of the [Reactive](http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/) Manifesto.  [Lamport](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamport_timestamps) timestamps and [vector](http://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci2750/vector.clocks.pdf) clocks – all clever stuff.  Symmetricom offers a [read](http://www.symmetricom.com/resources/newsletters/think-sync/January-2008/NTP-AND-THE-HAPPENED-BEFORE-RELATION/) on Lamport and NTP.  Food for thought for globally distributed reactive event architectures
