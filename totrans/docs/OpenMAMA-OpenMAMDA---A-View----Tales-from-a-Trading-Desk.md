# OpenMAMA/OpenMAMDA – A View? | Tales from a Trading Desk

> 来源：[https://mdavey.wordpress.com/2013/04/23/openmamaopenmamda-a-view/#0001-01-01](https://mdavey.wordpress.com/2013/04/23/openmamaopenmamda-a-view/#0001-01-01)

## OpenMAMA/OpenMAMDA – A View?

[OpenMAMA](http://www.openmama.org/) is interesting from many angles.  The “[architecture](http://www.openmama.org/developers/openmama-architecture)” reminds me of a few off the shelf products.  The [roadmap](http://www.openmama.org/about-openmama-project/roadmap) appears to have identified some interesting features, particularly the entitlements and pluggable data models.  There appears to be no view of [performance](http://www.openmama.org/developers) on the web site – maybe I’ve missed a page?  Hence the question to any reader:  has anyone used OpenMAMA outside of a PoC?  If the answer is yes to the proceeding question, did you use Avis or another middleware?
