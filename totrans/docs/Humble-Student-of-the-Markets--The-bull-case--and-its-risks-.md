# Humble Student of the Markets: The bull case (and its risks)

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2020/04/the-bull-case-and-its-risks.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2020/04/the-bull-case-and-its-risks.html#0001-01-01)

In the past few weeks, a number of investors and strategists have turned bullish. I would like to address the reasoning for the bull case for equities, and the risks to the reasoning. History shows that recessions are bull market killers, and bear markets do not resolve themselves this quickly without a prolonged period of adjustment.

Here are the bullish arguments:

*   The lockdowns are ending.
*   A possible drug treatment breakthrough.
*   The Fed is coming to the rescue.
*   Investors are looking ahead to 2021, and 2020 is a writeoff.
