# Humble Student of the Markets: Why is Shanghai falling?

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2012/08/why-is-shanghai-falling.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2012/08/why-is-shanghai-falling.html#0001-01-01)

There has been some buzz over a post at

[Global Macro Monitor](http://macromon.wordpress.com/2012/08/19/the-chart-that-keeps-us-up-at-night/)

about the divergence between the Shanghai Composite and other global equity indices.

Both

and

[Josh Brown](http://www.thereformedbroker.com/2012/08/20/hot-links-great-quarter-guys/)

have picked up on this and there seems to be some hang wringing over this apparent negative divergence.

The answer is simple - China's current policy of growth at any price that results in profitless growth (see my previous post

[Crouching tiger, hidden profits](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2012/08/crouching-tiger-hidden-profit.html)

).

Divergence explained.
