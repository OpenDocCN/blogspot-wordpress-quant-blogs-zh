# Magmasystems Blog: We are Hiring

> 来源：[http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2008/09/we-are-hiring.html#0001-01-01](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2008/09/we-are-hiring.html#0001-01-01)

I am going to indulge in what some of you might think is boorish and vulture-like behavior. My heart bleeds for the people at Lehman, Bear, and Merrill who have been displaced, either recently or in the near future. However, people have to live and they need to support their families. So, here I go ....

My company has openings in most of the departments within Equities .... market making, trading systems, risk, etc. We are interested in all skill sets, most notably Java and C++. We need great, hard-core developers. These are not management positions.

If you are interested, please send me a resume. I do not profit personally from this. I am just interested in seeing us with the best talent out there, and catching up to our remaining competitors.
