# VIX and More: Charting the Recent Decline of the BRIC Components

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2013/07/charting-recent-decline-of-bric.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2013/07/charting-recent-decline-of-bric.html#0001-01-01)

U.S. stocks are mostly green in today’s session, though there is a good deal of red in global stocks, notably in [emerging markets](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/emerging%20markets), where the popular [EEM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EEM) emerging markets ETF is down close to 1% as I type this and the [Brazil](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Brazil) ([EWZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EWZ)) is down more than 2%.

In the chart below, I plot the recent decline of the four large [BRIC](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/BRIC) emerging market country ETFs: Brazil (EWZ); [Russia](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Russia) ([RSX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/RSX)); [India](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/India) ([EPI](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EPI)); [China](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/China) ([FXI](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/FXI)). While all four country ETFs have declined between 8% and 20% during the past six weeks, the various woes afflicting each country appear to be country-specific to a large extent, though obviously the issues affecting China’s manufacturing base and export market have a significant upstream impact on Brazil.

Emerging markets in general have been struggling as of late, but difficulties in Brazil, India and China have helped to fuel a global selloff.

Going forward, investors will be well-served to keep an eye on all four components of the BRIC block, as well as aggregated BRIC ETFs, such as the most popular issue in this space: the iShares MSCI BRIC Index ([BKF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/BKF)).

For those who are interested in evaluating the risk and uncertainty in emerging markets in general, the recent [VEXXM as a Measure of Emerging Markets Volatility and Risk](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2013/06/vxeem-as-measure-of-emerging-markets.html) is recommended reading for some background and information on [VXEEM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXEEM), the CBOE Emerging Markets ETF Volatility Index.
