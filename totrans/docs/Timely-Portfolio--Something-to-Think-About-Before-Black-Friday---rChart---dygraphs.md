US Retail stocks have been killing it.  Since the holiday season starting with Black Friday is so important to retail, let’s look at the US Retail industry price and Sharpe ratio using R [rCharts](http://rcharts.io/howitworks) and Performance analytics +  javascript [dygraphs](http://dygraphs.com).  Thanks Kenneth French once again for the [dataset](http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html).
