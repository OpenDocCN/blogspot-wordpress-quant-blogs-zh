# The Python Angle | Tales from a Trading Desk

> 来源：[https://mdavey.wordpress.com/2014/04/30/the-python-angle/#0001-01-01](https://mdavey.wordpress.com/2014/04/30/the-python-angle/#0001-01-01)

It continue to be journey for Python in finance.  The JP Morgan [Athena](http://techcareers.jpmorgan.com/cm/BlobServer/athena_jpmc.pdf?blobkey=id&blobwhere=1320615212303&blobheader=application/pdf&blobheadername1=Cache-Control&blobheadervalue1=private&blobcol=urldata&blobtable=MungoBlobs) project that (based on google data) pushed to retire Murex, using concepts born out of [Slang/SecDB](https://mdavey.wordpress.com/2014/04/22/fx-client-services/http://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ohpyt/how_and_why_bank_of_america_decided_to_rebuild/ "FX Client Services") is now a number of years old, as presumably achieve many goals.  In many ways the [Quartz](http://thegatewayonline.com/technology/technology-at-a-bank/bank-of-america-merrill-lynch-become-part-of-the-quartz-community) project over at Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s offers integrated trading, position management, pricing and risk management platform which correlate in many ways to the Athena JP Morgan project, that it correlates back to GS 😉  The Python Quants [about](http://www.thepythonquants.com/#about) page offer a hint of the history of these three corporations/projects.

Another interesting Python angle is the NumPy/SciPy Many-Core Accelerator [support](http://www.parallella.org/Ideas/) available on [Parallella](http://www.parallella.org/).  Especially given the recent blog posting regards [64-cores](http://www.parallella.org/2014/04/25/the-64-core-parallella-is-alive/), and the fact that Bank of America, and presumably JPMorgan are doing “Ultra High Performance” [pricing](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/conference-for-python-quants-tickets-10173740933).

The journey continues when we look at Washington Square [Technologies](http://www.washingtonsquaretech.com/).  The web site offers the briefest of information:

> open development environment that is integrated with market data, reference data, market conventions, high level business objects, and all the source code

Does this mean its version 4?  Have Bank of America and JP Morgan co-funded a new product company?  Should we expect this “environment” to appear in numerous other banks in the near future, offering Python a rich and rosy future for both sides of the financial playing field?

> Buy side or sell side, securities or derivatives, trading strategy development, derivative pricing and execution, risk management, or operational workflows

Python contractors probably have a rosy future 😉

Final thought:  JP Morgan Athena appears to be ahead in the buzz word bingo game with an appropriate [reactive](http://techcareers.jpmorgan.com/cm/BlobServer/athena_jpmc.pdf?blobkey=id&blobwhere=1320615212303&blobheader=application/pdf&blobheadername1=Cache-Control&blobheadervalue1=private&blobcol=urldata&blobtable=MungoBlobs) feature set for Athena – especially given the great work on in [Reactive Streams](http://www.reactive-streams.org/), and by TypeSafe with Akka [Streams](https://typesafe.com/blog/typesafe-announces-akka-streams).
