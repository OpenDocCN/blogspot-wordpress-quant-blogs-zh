# Magmasystems Blog: Tibco and Hardware Acceleration

> 来源：[http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2008/06/tibco-and-hardware-acceleration.html#0001-01-01](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2008/06/tibco-and-hardware-acceleration.html#0001-01-01)

It is interesting to note

Tibco's

sudden renewed interest in Rendezvous (RV). A few months ago, I had lunch with an ex-

Tibco

consultant who now consults independently for various Wall Street companies. This fellow told me that

Tibco

was really paying attention to the shots fired across its bow by companies like

RTI

, 29West, and

Tervela

. Because of this,

Tibco

would try to breathe some new life into RV, after spending so much focus on EMS.

Coincidentally, two people independently told me to take a look at Solace Systems. Solace seems to do XML content-based parsing and routing. This was the same route taken by

Xambala

, a company who I have not heard much about lately.

Hardware-based routing of XML packets would seem to fit in well with Morgan Stanley's CPS message bus. It would also fit in well with

CEP

engines that like to deal with XML, such as Coral8\. Imagine a hardware-based XML-to-Coral8-

Tuple

processor. Or something that would take XML-based

newsfeeds

and do some kind of parsing that could be used with semantic processing engines, like

Semlab

. Or, can there be any kind of synergies between hardware-based XML transformations and

WPF

/

XAML

?

I would be interested to hear

anyone's

ideas around messaging and hardware acceleration.

Here are some links to articles about the Solace/

Tibco

partnership:

I hope that

Tibco

also starts thinking about hardware acceleration for EMS as well as RV.

*Addendum***As per Brian Theodore's comment below, the hardware acceleration that Solace is providing to RV does not involve any XML parsing.*
