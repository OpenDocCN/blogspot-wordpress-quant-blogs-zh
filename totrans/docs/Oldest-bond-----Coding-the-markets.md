## Oldest bond ?

### May 31, 2006

Are [UK Consols](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consol) the oldest bond ?  I'm guessing they are, since the British Govt is the oldest government in the world. That is, it's been uninterrupted by revolution since 1688\. I think the US has the next longest running govt.
