# VIX and More: Intrade 2009 Recession Prediction Contract

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/08/intrade-2009-recession-prediction.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/08/intrade-2009-recession-prediction.html#0001-01-01)

Since I have not seen it mentioned anywhere else, I thought I should point out that [Intade.com](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Intrade), the [prediction market](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/prediction%20markets) site, now has a contract covering whether or not the United States will go into a recession at any time during 2009.  While the contract currently suggests a greater than 50% probability that the U.S. will slip into a recession in 2009, I find it interesting that the contract price has been slipping over the past 2-3 weeks, suggesting that the likelihood of a recession next year is declining.
