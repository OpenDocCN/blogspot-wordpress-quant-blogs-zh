## Dark Pools

A colleague [recommended](http://www.scottpattersonreports.com/) Dark [Pools](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Dark-Pools-I-trading-machines/dp/1847940978) recently.  Having just finished reading the book, I’d say its definitely worth a read if you are interested in where ITCH, OUCH and the Island started.

*   Page 62 – Layering, spoofing and quote stuffing
*   Page 119 – ITCH and OUCH
*   Page 153 – REDIBook
*   Page 199 – Lamborghini Testarossa – pretty sure that should have been Ferrari
*   Page 238 – Chi-X
*   Page 285 – Getco using Kodu
*   Page 295 – [Relativistic](http://blog.themistrading.com/hfts-locating-their-servers-now-in-the-middle-of-the-ocean/) statistical [arbitrage](http://www.alexwg.org/publications/PhysRevE_82-056104.pdf)
