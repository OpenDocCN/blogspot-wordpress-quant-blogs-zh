# Timely Portfolio: Better Bullets

> 来源：[http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2012/01/better-bullets.html#0001-01-01](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2012/01/better-bullets.html#0001-01-01)

As I reread my [Few’s Bullets in Axys Reports](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2012/01/fews-bullets-in-axys-reports.html) post, I think the better way to visualize this

would be to make the max the max from the entire series, so the scale is consistent.

The very slightly changed Excel file with the new line of code is [here](http://www.box.com/s/9jenb341qmv4iaoeh5uy). Everything else is the same as [Few’s Bullets in Axys Reports](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2012/01/fews-bullets-in-axys-reports.html).

As always, I love comments and suggestions.  Please let me know your thoughts.
