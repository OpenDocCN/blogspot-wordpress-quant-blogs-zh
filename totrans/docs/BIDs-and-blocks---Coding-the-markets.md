## BIDs and blocks

### September 28, 2006

Thanks to [Matt](http://mdavey.wordpress.com) for [the news](http://mdavey.wordpress.com/2006/09/27/bids/) on [Bids](http://www.finextra.com/fullstory.asp?id=15928) – a new block trading system. Since the system is completely anonymised, I can’t see how it solves the information asymmetry problem for the trader offering block liquidity. How can he be sure that the liquidity taker isn’t better informed, and about to leave him with a massive position against which the market then moves ?
