# Humble Student of the Markets: Pockets of opportunity in an uncertain market

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2020/07/pockets-of-opportunity-in-uncertain.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2020/07/pockets-of-opportunity-in-uncertain.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models**

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post,

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The

**Trend Asset Allocation Model**

is an asset allocation model which applies trend following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or contraction (bearish)?"

My inner trader uses a

**trading model**

, which is a blend of price momentum (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa). Subscribers receive real-time alerts of model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of the those email alerts are updated weekly

. The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that began in March 2016 is shown below.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Sell equities*
*   Trend Model signal: Neutral*
*   Trading model: Bearish*

** The performance chart and model readings have been delayed by a week out of respect to our paying subscribers.* **Update schedule**

**Still range-bound**

The market ended the week at the top of a tight range between 3000 and 3240\. For the bulls, they can point to:

*   The market shrugging off bad news about the rising US infection rate and death rate.
*   Hopeful news on vaccine development, despite some of my doubts (see [A Covid recovery?](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2020/07/15/a-covid-recovery/)).
*   Constructive signs from breadth indicators and cyclical stocks.

The bears can point to:

*   Nagging cautionary flags from inter-market, or cross-asset, analysis, such as the persistent downward pressure shown by the 10-year Treasury yield, which continues to test the 0.60% support level even as stocks test upside resistance.
*   Faltering momentum from Chinese stocks (see [Double bubble, double trouble?](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2020/07/11/double-bubble-double-trouble/)).
*   Elevated bullishness on sentiment models, which is contrarian bearish.

There is no point in wringing my hands about the range-bound market. The market will gives us some clue on direction once it stages a breakout, either on the upside or downside. Instead, I outline some of the pockets of opportunity, and other corners of the market to avoid.
