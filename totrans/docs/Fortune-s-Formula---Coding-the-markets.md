## Fortune’s Formula

### May 24, 2007

I’m currently reading William [Poundstone](http://home.williampoundstone.net/)‘s [Fortune’s Forumula](http://www.amazon.com/Fortunes-Formula-Scientific-Betting-Casinos/dp/0809046377). I’m only 90 pages in, and Poundstone has already introduced the Mob, illegal gambling in the US, [Claude Shannon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon) and his Information Theory, [John Kelly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Larry_Kelly%2C_Jr), [Ed Thorp](http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_O._Thorp), Norbert Wiener and the connections thereof.

If you’re at all interested in the intersection between maths, gambling, computing and markets, this is the book for you.
