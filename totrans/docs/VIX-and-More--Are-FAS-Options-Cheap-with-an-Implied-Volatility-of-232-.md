# VIX and More: Are FAS Options Cheap with an Implied Volatility of 232?

Generally the thought of buying some options on the cheap is not consistent with an [implied volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/implied%20volatility) (IV) of 232.

Today, I have a counterexample to consider.

Take the case of [FAS](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/FAS), one of the new [Direxion](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Direxion) [triple leverage ETFs](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/triple%20ETFs). FAS is intended to track 300% of the price performance of the Russell 1000 Financial Services Index. In the recent market environment this has proven to be a daunting task, resulting in FAS racking up a 30 day [historical volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/historical%20volatility) number of 332 – a full 100 points higher than the current implied volatility.

In practical terms, an IV of 232 translates into an anticipated average change of 14.6% per day. For comparison purposes, an IV of 332 translates into an average daily move of 21%. So far the mean one day change in closing prices for FAS has been 17.4%. Looking at recent history, an implied volatility of 232 may turn out to be a bargain and options in FAS may not be as expensive as they look…
