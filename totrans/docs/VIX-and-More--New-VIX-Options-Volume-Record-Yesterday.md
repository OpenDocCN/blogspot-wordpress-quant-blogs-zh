# VIX and More: New VIX Options Volume Record Yesterday

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/07/new-vix-options-volume-record-yesterday.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/07/new-vix-options-volume-record-yesterday.html#0001-01-01)

The VIX has been setting records for options volume on a fairly regular basis. This should not come as a surprise, as VIX options are still [less than a year and a half old](http://www.cboe.com/otec/ETrade/micro/vix/vixoptions.aspx), making records easy to come by, even without resorting to steroids and corked bats.

Yesterday marked [another VIX options volume record](http://www.exchange-handbook.co.uk/index.cfm?section=news&action=detail&id=68165), with the 322,484 contracts easily besting the previous record of 277,260 from back on May 16, 2007\. I generally don't bother to mention this type of news, because I have yet to find a meaningful relationship between [VIX futures volume](http://cfe.cboe.com/publish/ScheduledTask/MktData/datahouse/CFEVolOI.csv) or [VIX options volume](http://www.ivolatility.com/options.j?ticker=VIX:CBOE&R=1&period=12&chart=2&vct=) and subsequent market moves.

Given that it's a slow day from a VIX perspective, I thought I'd throw out the 'news' and see if any readers care to comment on VIX options volume and what it may tell us about the direction of the markets.
