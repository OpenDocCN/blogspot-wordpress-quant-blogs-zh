# Humble Student of the Markets: The Grand Experiment

The long term outlook for the USD continues to look dire. As the

broke that the G8 failed to reach a consensus on policy, but believed that the world economy is too weak to withdraw stimulus, and the

, the

program.

As I have written

[before](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2009/01/could-gbp-be-canary-in-mine.html)

, Britain is the canary in the coal mine for the US. The UK, unlike the US, has a very similar range of problems as the US but does not have the luxury of being the issuer of a major reserve currency.

As Macro Man commented yesterday (before the BoE announcement):

> [I]t's worth noting that today sees an announcement from one of the few CBs in a tighter spot than the Fed....the Bank of England. Inflation has consistently exceeded expectations, and a prior raft of better-than-expected activity data has recently receded into sharp declines. Oh, and the fiscal situation is worse than that in the US, and adminsitered by a government that's now utterly bereft of credibility.

The BoE is embarking on a grand experiment with its QE policy.

Watch this space for what may follow if the Fed follows this path.
