# Front-Run The Delta: Micro-Caps of Interest

> 来源：[https://frontrunthedelta.blogspot.com/2007/11/micro-caps-of-interest.html#0001-01-01](https://frontrunthedelta.blogspot.com/2007/11/micro-caps-of-interest.html#0001-01-01)

Just a few micros I've been watching over the last several months. Very briefly:

SpaceDev (OTC:

[SPDV](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=SPDV.OB)

): Space equipment r&d. Just a very long-term buy and hold, maybe build up enough of a position to get someone I know a seat on the board.

Aurelio Resource Corp. (OTC:

[AULO](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=AULO.OB)

): Extensive mining interests in Nevada. Possible take-over target of larger producer. Again, long-term buy and hold.

FD: I have positions in each of the above.
