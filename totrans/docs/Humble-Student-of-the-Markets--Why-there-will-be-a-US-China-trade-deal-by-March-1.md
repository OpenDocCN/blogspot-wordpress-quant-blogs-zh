# Humble Student of the Markets: Why there will be a US-China trade deal by March 1

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2019/02/why-there-will-be-us-china-trade-deal.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2019/02/why-there-will-be-us-china-trade-deal.html#0001-01-01)

Stock prices began on a sour note this morning (Thursday) on the fears of a European growth slowdown. They slid further when Trump advisor Larry Kudlow appeared on Fox Business News and said that there's "a sizable difference" between the US and China's positions in the trade negotiations. The White House went on to pour cold water on the idea of an imminent Trump-Xi summit and said that the two may not meet before the March 1 deadline.

The two most trade deal sensitive vehicles, Chinese equity ETFs and soybean prices, weakened as a consequence. However, their technical patterns remain constructive. FXI (top panel) remains in an uptrend as it tested a resistance zone after exhibiting a double bottom. Soybean prices are also in an uptrend and they are also testing resistance.

My inclination is to shrug off the negative headlines as posturing by American negotiators. There will be a trade deal. Here is why.

**A Special Announcement**

We told you so. We told you the market was going down.

Here is the track of

***Humble Student of the Markets***

, where we are neither perma-bulls nor perma-bears. Most recently, we have been correctly bullish since the correction of 2015, and turned cautious in August 2018 (see

August 5, 2018).

We were also timely at the 2009 bottom. We issued a call to buy beaten up low-priced stocks with high insider buying a week before the ultimate bottom (see
