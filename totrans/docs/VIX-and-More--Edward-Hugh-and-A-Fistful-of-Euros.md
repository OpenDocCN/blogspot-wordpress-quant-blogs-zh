# VIX and More: Edward Hugh and A Fistful of Euros

Ever since the [European sovereign debt crisis](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/European%20sovereign%20debt%20crisis) began flaring up, I have made it a habit to read Edward Hugh’s excellent [A Fistful of Euros](http://fistfulofeuros.net/). While [The Economist](http://www.economist.com/) and the [Financial Times](http://www.ft.com/home/us) are two top notch resources for U.S. investors hoping to avoid an Americentric bias and incorporate a European perspective into events as they unfold across the pond, it continues to appear that ultimately the fate of the euro zone will be determined by events in [Spain](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Spain). Given the likely trajectory of events, I can’t think of a better time than the present to be reading what Barcelona-based economist Hugh has to say about Spain and the European financial difficulties.

For starters, check out Hugh’s last three offerings:

…then be sure to check out the archives for a comprehensive set of charts and data about the Spanish economy, more commentary, etc.

Readers, what other top European-based economics blogs should we all be reading?
