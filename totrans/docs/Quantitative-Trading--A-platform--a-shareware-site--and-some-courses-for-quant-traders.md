# Quantitative Trading: A platform, a shareware site, and some courses for quant traders

> 来源：[http://epchan.blogspot.com/2011/05/platform-shareware-site-and-some.html#0001-01-01](http://epchan.blogspot.com/2011/05/platform-shareware-site-and-some.html#0001-01-01)

I mentioned in various places that

[Alphacet Discovery](http://www.alphacet.com/)

is an industrial strength integrated platform for backtesting and implementing quantitative trading strategies. But of course, it has many competitors, one of which is a relatively new company called

[Deltix](http://www.deltixlab.com/)

. Deltix has the distinction of offering a full Matlab interface, which is convenient if you are already a Matlab programmer. (Full disclosure: I previously have a consulting relationship with Alphacet, but have none with Deltix.)

There is also a new website for sharing trading strategy software called

[Quantonomics](http://quantonomics.com/)

. In the words of its founder Joshua, the goal is to "connect programmers and stock traders". Joshua also told me that he will create a custom application on his site for any of you readers as a gift!

A colleague of mine in Singapore, Dr. Li Haksun, who was previously a quant with UBS and BNP Paribas, is offering a

[course on quantitative trading strategy](http://www.ntusgxcfe.ntu.edu.sg/ATC-TSD/ATC-TSD1.html)

 in July. It covers more theoretical concepts than my own courses: e.g. hidden markov model, stochastic control, and Kalman filters are included.

And of course, my own workshops on

[Backtesting](http://www.technicalanalyst.co.uk/training/backtestingEC.htm)

and

[Statistical Arbitrage](http://www.technicalanalyst.co.uk/training/statarb.htm)

will be offered again in London next week.
