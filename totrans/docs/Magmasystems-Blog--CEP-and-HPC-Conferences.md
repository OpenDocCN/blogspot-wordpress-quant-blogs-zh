# Magmasystems Blog: CEP and HPC Conferences

> 来源：[http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2007/09/cep-and-hpc-conferences.html#0001-01-01](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2007/09/cep-and-hpc-conferences.html#0001-01-01)

I will be stopping by the High Performance Computing on Wall Street conference on Monday, Sept 17, and catch up with the new Digipede release.

Wednesday through Friday, I will be at the Gartner Complex Event Processing conference in Orlando.

I am starting to feel like a vendor. However, in my new role, I am basically playing software entrepreneur again, this time in the context of a multi-billion company.
