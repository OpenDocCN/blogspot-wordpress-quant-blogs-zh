## AI Driven Retrospectives

With the drive of AI and chatbot recently, its of no surprise to find [ScrumBot](https://www.scrumbot.co/).  What I think would however be more interesting is to hook the bot into a wider array of data outside of the Slack/Hipchat/Microsoft Teams world, maybe levering product metrics, as well as SDLC metrics.  [Standuply](https://standuply.com/) appears to hint at this via the third party metrics integration.  I suspect if the bot could leverage a appropriate metrics, its would be powerful not only from a retrospective, but also from a pair engineering experience as well
