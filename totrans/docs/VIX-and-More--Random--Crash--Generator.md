# VIX and More: Random ‘Crash’ Generator

On the heels of my [Tuesday link-a-thon](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/10/super-tuesday-links.html) mention of [Ian Woodward](http://www.highgrowthstock.com/IanBlog/)’s comments on the [Hindenburg Omen](http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=%7BDA451070-3B84-4BCE-ADAD-11B3D26FDE87%7D&siteid=mktw&dist=), I noticed yesterday that Ian had another post up which mentioned a [second Hindenburg Omen signal](http://www.highgrowthstock.com/IanBlog/?p=194#respond).

I figured it was about time to comment on Ian’s work, so I entered the requested information in the comment form below and when I went to check the anti-spam randomizer box to see what sort of strange characters I needed to type to prove that I am not a spambot, I found the image below:

Now I am not a particularly superstitious person, nor do I spend much time thinking about entrails, and I realize that it is possible to code in a small set of possible anti-spam choices...but I must say that on the heels of reading about the Hindenburg Omen, my first thought was that surely the Anti-Spam Omen must be a signal worth heeding.

Back to our regularly scheduled market correction…
