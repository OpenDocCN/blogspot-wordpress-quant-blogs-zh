# VIX and More: Recent Thoughts on the VIX

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2011/10/recent-thoughts-on-vix.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2011/10/recent-thoughts-on-vix.html#0001-01-01)

The *VIX and More* blog has been quiet for a while as I enjoyed some vacation time and family time. Of course it always seems that when I take some time off the VIX decides to do something extreme and this time around it was no exception.

While I am about to return to writing regularly in this space going forward, I did want to remind readers that no matter how active the blog is, I am always sharing my thoughts on the VIX and volatility on a weekly basis in the [VIX and More subscriber newsletter](http://vixandmoresubscriber.blogspot.com/) (which is available with a 14-day free trial) and also in more in-depth feature articles in [Expiring Monthly: The Option Traders Journal](http://www.expiringmonthly.com/). Back in July I made some changes to the newsletter to place more emphasis on the [VIX exchange-traded products](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20ETN) and using the [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures) [term structure](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/term%20structure) to enhance trading strategies.

Expiring Monthly continues to be where I publish my extended thinking on volatility. Last week we published the October edition of the magazine and in it was my latest, *Investing Implications of the VIX Term Structure*. This article actually built on one of my pieces from the September issue of Expiring Monthly: *Trading the Expanding VIX Products Space*.

Since I [last recapped](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2011/05/expiring-monthly-may-2011-issue-recap.html) the Expiring Monthly content in May, I have also authored the following articles for the magazine:

*   *VIX Convexity* (June)
*   *Crises, Event Theta and Risk Assessment* (July)
*   *Volatility During Crises* (cover article for August)
*   *A History of VIX Futures Roll Yields* (September)

There was a time that I felt that if I did not offer my thoughts on the VIX, the subject would probably be ignored. Now I am delighted to say that there are a number of others who have taken up the cause to provide regular analysis and commentary on the volatility space. Going forward, this gives me more freedom to touch on a wider variety of issues across the investment landscape, but rest assured, the VIX and volatility will always be at the core of my thinking.
