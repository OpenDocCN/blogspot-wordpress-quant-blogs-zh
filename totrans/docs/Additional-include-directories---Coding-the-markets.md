## Additional include directories

### March 12, 2007

The extra include directories one adds working with a large C++ codebase in Visual C++ were a real pain in VC6.  The project settings had a small one line edit field. Often it was easier to ctrl-C/ctrl-V to a real editor to change the include path. Now VC8 has added a little ellipsis button at the end of the edit field which brings up a nice dialog, rather like Tools/Options/Directories always had. So simple, but it makes so much difference to working in the IDE.
