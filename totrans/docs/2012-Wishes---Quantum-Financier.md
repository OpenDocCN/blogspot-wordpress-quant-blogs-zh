# 2012 Wishes – Quantum Financier

> 来源：[https://quantumfinancier.wordpress.com/2011/12/28/what-to-expect-in-2012/#0001-01-01](https://quantumfinancier.wordpress.com/2011/12/28/what-to-expect-in-2012/#0001-01-01)

As we look to 2011 through the rear view mirror, I make a quick divergence from my recent lethargy to send my best wishes for 2012 to all readers. May 2012 be a trading year filled with opportunities you capitalize on.

See you in the new year.
