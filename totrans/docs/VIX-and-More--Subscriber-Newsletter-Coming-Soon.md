# VIX and More: Subscriber Newsletter Coming Soon

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/03/subscriber-newsletter-coming-soon_23.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/03/subscriber-newsletter-coming-soon_23.html#0001-01-01)

After many requests to provide more details about my thinking vis-à-vis the markets in general and individual stocks in particular, I am preparing to launch a subscriber newsletter. Given the recent market turmoil and the considerable uncertainty about the path forward, this seems like as good a time as any to take this step.

Targeting many subject areas covered by the blog, the newsletter will focus more on market sentiment analysis and technical analysis than on broad macroeconomic issues and stock fundamentals. In truth, my investing approach includes all four elements, but I think the macroeconomic and fundamental aspects of the market are covered quite thoroughly already, whereas good information on TA and particularly market sentiment tend to be much more difficult to find.

I am currently considering two issues per week, as follows:

*   A Sunday issue will provide a review of the past week and my thinking on what to watch for in the coming week. I will include my outlook on a variety of asset classes as well as purchases and sales in three different model portfolios.

*   A Wednesday issue will be more of a features-based approach, but will consistently target sectors and industries, market sentiment, charts of interest, and reader questions.

The blog will remain active and I will continue to strive for high quality content here, but it would be safe to say that I intend to save some of what I consider to be my best thinking for the subscriber newsletter.

I encourage any feedback about the content, timing, or any other aspect of the newsletter. Feel free to speak up in the comments section below of e-mail me at bill.luby@gmail.com
