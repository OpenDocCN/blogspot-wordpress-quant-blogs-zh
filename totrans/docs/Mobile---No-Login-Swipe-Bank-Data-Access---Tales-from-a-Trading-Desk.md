## Mobile – No-Login Swipe Bank Data Access

It’s always interesting travelling as you get insight into what regional banks are doing, and the vibe of the “street”.  Australia appears to be way ahead in some respects on the retail bank mobile front.

Check out [Cash Tank](http://www.westpac.co.nz/branch-mobile-online/while-you-re-mobile/cash-tank-for-iphone-and-android/) from Westpac.  A simple but novel banking app which provide bank balance access via a swipe – no need for login (apart from when set-up occurs). [Commonwealth](http://www.netbanker.com/2012/03/commonwealth_banks_kaching_app_has_no-login_option_simple_balance.html) Bank has something similar – [Simple Balance](http://www.commbank.com.au/mobile/commbank-kaching/what-is-kaching.html#2everydaybanking).  Cash Tank is clever in that the balance gauge is defined by the user via the high/low [values](https://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/westpac-cash-tank/id485225521?mt=8), so nobody looking at your phone can actually tell what your real balance is.

Near-field communication ([NFC](http://www.zdnet.com/westpac-trials-nfc-payments-on-android-phones-7000002174/)) technology is also something that [banks](http://www.zdnet.com/westpac-trials-nfc-payments-on-android-phones-7000002174/) are [pushing](http://www.businessspectator.com.au/news/2012/8/30/technology/westpac-partners-oberthur-technologies-android-nfc-payment-system) [down](http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2013/02/commonwealth-bank-working-on-nfc-payments-for-iphone-5/) [under](http://delimiter.com.au/2012/08/08/westpac-launches-android-nfc-payments-app/), whereas back in the UK we appear to be in [Contactless](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contactless_payment) [payment](http://www.visaeurope.com/en/cardholders/visa_paywave/how_it_works.aspx) land.
