# Azure: Invitation Code | Tales from a Trading Desk

> 来源：[https://mdavey.wordpress.com/2009/01/20/azure-invitation-code/#0001-01-01](https://mdavey.wordpress.com/2009/01/20/azure-invitation-code/#0001-01-01)

## Azure: Invitation Code

I finally got the invitation code I have been waiting for:

> This invitation to participate in the Windows Azure Community Technical Preview is subject to the following usage limits:
> 
> Total compute usage: 2000 VM hours
> Cloud storage capacity: 50GB
> Total storage bandwidth: 20GB/day

Now all I need is a few hours of quite to actually get some code into Azure. The more I think about the whole idea of putting the basics of a [SDP](http://waratah.wordpress.com/2007/06/20/single-dealer-offerings/) into the cloud the sooner I can validate Azure from a financial perspective.
