# Humble Student of the Markets: How bears turn into bulls

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2022/10/how-bears-turn-into-bulls.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2022/10/how-bears-turn-into-bulls.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models** 

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post, 

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The 

**Trend Asset Allocation Model**

 is an asset allocation model that applies trend-following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity prices. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. The performance and full details of a model portfolio based on the out-of-sample signals of the Trend Model can be found

.

My inner trader uses a 

**trading model**

, which is a blend of price momentum (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa). Subscribers receive real-time alerts of model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of the email alerts is updated weekly

. The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that began in March 2016 is shown below.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Sell equities*
*   Trend Model signal: Neutral*
*   Trading model: Bullish*

**A failed reversal**

Last week, I highlighted a possible bullish reversal candlestick on the weekly chart, but warned that the reversal needs to be confirmed by the next candle. This week, the S&P 500 weakened and failed to confirm the reversal candle, though the market is still exhibiting a positive 5-week RSI divergence and it is still testing support at the 200 week moving average.

Regardless, I am seeing helpful signs of leadership rotation. During bear markets, the old market leaders fade and new leadership emerges to lead the new bull cycle. The change in leadership is a constructive market internal that is indicative of a bottoming process.
