# Humble Student of the Markets: A toppy market, but not THE TOP

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2017/03/a-toppy-market-but-not-top.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2017/03/a-toppy-market-but-not-top.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models**

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post,

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The

**Trend Model**

is an asset allocation model which applies trend following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or contraction (bearish)?"

My inner trader uses the

**trading component**

of the Trend Model to look for changes in the direction of the main Trend Model signal. A bullish Trend Model signal that gets less bullish is a trading "sell" signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading "buy" signal. The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. Past trading of the trading model has shown turnover rates of about 200% per month.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Buy equities*
*   Trend Model signal: Risk-on*
*   Trading model: Bearish*

on weekends and tweet mid-week observations at @humblestudent. Subscribers will also receive email notices of any changes in my trading portfolio.

**Valuation and sentiment vs. momentum**

Last week, I wrote about signs of stretched stock market valuation (see  

[Why I am cautious on the market](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2017/03/05/why-i-am-cautious-on-the-market/)

). Last Wednesday, I warned about excessively bullish sentiment, which suggests that stock prices are likely to pull back (see

[A sentimental warning for bulls and bears](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2017/03/08/a-sentimental-warning-for-bulls-and-bears/)

).

Despite these red flags, I would caution that both valuation and sentiment models are notoriously bad at timing market tops. Expensive markets can get more expensive, and stock prices don`t necessarily go down if investors get into a crowded long. These models serve the highlight the risks to a market.

Here is another take on valuation. Taking a very long term 30-year view, 

[Urban Carmel](http://fat-pitch.blogspot.com/2014/11/when-buy-and-hold-works-and-when-it.html)

 observed that the SPX goes up and down in fits and starts after adjusting for inflation. The key to achieving superior long-term returns is to buy when valuations are low, which is not the case today.

Michael Batnick at

[Irrelevant Investor](http://theirrelevantinvestor.com/2017/02/13/should-stocks-be-worth-more-now-than-they-used-to-be/)

showed that the Cyclically Adjusted PE ratio (CAPE) is elevated when compared to its own history.

But average CAPE has been rising over time.

If valuation doesn't work for short term market timing, what should investors do? In the intermediate term, a focus on fundamental and macro momentum in addition to factors like valuation and sentiment. Current conditions can more useful for market timing. Using this framework, it suggests that risks are rising, but there is no need to panic just yet.

The market is looking toppy, but this is not "the top".
