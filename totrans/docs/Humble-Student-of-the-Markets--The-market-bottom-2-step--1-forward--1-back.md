> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2016/02/the-market-bottom-2-step-1-forward-1.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2016/02/the-market-bottom-2-step-1-forward-1.html#0001-01-01)

**Explaining our market timing models**

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on research outlined in our post

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The

**Trend Model**

is an asset allocation model which applies trend following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or contraction (bearish)?"

My inner trader uses the

**trading component**

of the Trend Model seeks to answer the question, "Is the trend getting better (bullish) or worse (bearish)?" The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. Past trading of this model has shown turnover rates of about 200% per month.

The signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Buy equities*
*   Trend Model signal: Risk-off*
*   Trading model: Bearish*

 on weekends and tweet any changes during the week at @humblestudent. Subscribers will also receive email notices of any changes in my trading portfolio.

**The reversals continue**

In the last few weeks, I have been highlighting the improving macro-economic and fundamental backdrop, while voicing concerns over the technical damage suffered by the stock market. I had concluded that the market was undergoing a W-shaped choppy correction.

Last week brought a number of reversals. The macro and fundamental picture suffered a number of setbacks, which creates a number of longer term concerns. On the other hand, a review of the technical conditions showed considerable improvement.
