# Humble Student of the Markets: Cautious retail investors = More room to rally

There have been a number of cautionary signs from sentiment models lately. On the weekend,

[Barron's](http://blogs.barrons.com/focusonfunds/2014/12/05/large-cap-etfs-flashing-opimistic-extremes-ned-davis-research/)

featured an interview with Neil Leeson of Ned Davis Research:

> Leeson on Friday pointed to his firm’s crowd sentiment poll, which recently clocked in at “extremely optimistic” levels. Chart watchers often consider sentiment to function as a contrary indicator, one that can presage overly enthusiastic markets that are ripe to turn lower.
> 
> “This typically is not a great sign for the market going forward, at least in the near term,” Leeson said...
> 
> More specifically, Leeson singles out massive money flows into large-cap stock ETFs like the SPDR S+P 500 ETF (SPY) and the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA) as a red flag. In November, all large-cap stock ETFs took in $25 billion, the most ever.

Yesterday, I also highlighted a possible crowded long position from Rydex sentiment data (see

):

On the other hand, the latest release of the TD-Ameritrade Investor Movement Index (IMX), which tracks the equity commitment of TD-Ameritrade accounts, showed that retail investors retreated from their bullishness:

I differentiate the contradictory readings this way, on the basis of different investor constituents and time horizons:

*   **Fast HF money:** Money flows into ETFs like SPY and DIA reflect the commitment of hedge fund fast-money first and retail funds flow second;
*   **Fast retail money**: Rydex sentiment measures how the individual swing trading community is behaving; and
*   **Patient retail money**: TD Ameritrade IMX is more reflective of the behavior of the slower, patient individual investor.

I interpret these readings as the stock market looking a bit overbought in the short-term and may be in need of a pause, but, as the mom-and-pop retail investor isn`t all-in yet, stock prices have more room to rally on an intermediate term basis.
