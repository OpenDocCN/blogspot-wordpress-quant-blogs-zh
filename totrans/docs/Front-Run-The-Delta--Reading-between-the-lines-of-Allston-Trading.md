# Front-Run The Delta: Reading between the lines of Allston Trading

> 来源：[https://frontrunthedelta.blogspot.com/2011/07/reading-between-lines-of-allston.html#0001-01-01](https://frontrunthedelta.blogspot.com/2011/07/reading-between-lines-of-allston.html#0001-01-01)

Several days ago I received an email from

[High-Frequency Trading Review](http://highfrequencytradingreview.com/)

containing this

[PDF](http://highfrequencytradingreview.com/pdf/PeterNabicht-HFTR.pdf)

of an interview with

[Allston Trading's](http://www.allstontrading.com/)

CTO Peter Nabicht.  At face value the interview is relatively benign, but reading between the lines can provide a view of the forest while the trees still remain a bit blurry.  This is particularly interesting to me because I have long watched firms like Allston (

[TransMarket Group](http://www.transmarketgroup.com/)

,

[Knight Capital](http://www.knight.com/)

and

[others](http://www.etfsecurities.com/fund/Market_Makers_100611.pdf)

) that operate in this space.

On developing the structure of a trade:

> [pg 2] You have situations where you’re making markets on one product on one exchange, you get filled so you have to go to another market to get your hedge off.

> [pg 2] As an industry we have to stop looking at products and markets and asset classes as unconnected entities and start looking at the whole of the *global market* as the interconnected system that it is.  **[italics, my own]**

Much of my work in this blog will be an expansion of this point.  The markets are quickly becoming more and more integrated as technology increases and products get replicated or become dual-listed around the globe.

On the value of learning from

[stories](http://researchpuzzle.com/blog/2011/06/23/telling-stories/)

:

> [pg 3] But speed isn’t always the most important factor. I remember running a trade for a while on the energy desk, a very basic spreading trade, between the physical and the cash delivered crude. We automated a trade that one of our guys was running by hand (point-and-click). Then we ran them side by side.  Guess what? He was consistently making money when I was losing money. When we looked into it, we discovered he was actually making money because he was slower...
> 
> [pg 4] Basically the automated trade was to immediately process every tick of those choppy markets and it was dumping position at our slippage tolerance.  But when trading manually he wasn't able to see every tick update and react to every little move so he was missing the market going against him and getting filled on his hedge when the market was coming back. He wasn't dumping as quickly, and that was working to his advantage. Some might say he was more risky because he wasn't reacting fast enough and some might say he was more profitable because of it.

On holding times:

> [pg 4] I guess you could say that our holding period is *as short as the market and profitability will allow*. In a very liquid market, it’s seconds or less, in less liquid markets it would be minutes and in the far out markets it's hours or more. **[italics, my own]**

On hiring the right people:

> [pg 7] You need people who have this balance of knowing what they are the best at but also knowing what they’re not the best at, and that's very difficult to find.

That sounds like my

On "infrastructure risk" and what I will be expanding on later:

> [pg 8]...that's very, very similar to the kind of risk we face *if we put on a trade at the CME and we want to hedge it with an ETF*, but right when we're getting ready to hedge, a backhoe goes through some fiber that's buried in the ground.

I've touched on

[ETF/Futures arbitrage](http://frontrunthedelta.blogspot.com/search/label/etf%2Ffutures%20arbitrage)

briefly before, but will be expanding on it in posts to come.  The currency ETFs against currency futures has been particularly interesting to study.
