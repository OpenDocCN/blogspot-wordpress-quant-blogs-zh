The Zweig Breadth Thrust buy signal in early November sparked a price surge and a price momentum chase. Already, the S&P 500 made a late-day charge above 4600 for a new recovery high. 

The price momentum factor is defined as stocks that beat the market continue to beat the market. The red line in the accompanying chart shows the difference between the one-month price momentum ETF (FDMO) and the six-month price momentum ETF (MTUM). One-month momentum has rocketed upward against six-month momentum, which is an indication that under-invested funds are scrambling to buy beta and momentum in order to catch up on performance.

In all likelihood, the momentum chase will last until year-end as fast money accounts continue to chase returns into year-end. The key question for investors is what happens after the chase?
