# Quantifiable Edges: No Turnaround Edge This Tuesday?

[Tuesday has shown strong inclinations to turn around](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2012/09/turnaround-tuesdays-revisited.html)

over the years when there has been a pullback leading up to it.  But when the pullback has been 2 days old

*and the market has been in a long-term uptrend*

, that turnaround inclination has not held true.

It's been the day session.  Below is a are the results of going long Tuesday morning after a 2-day pullback during an uptrend, and then exiting at the close.

As you can see, the stats show a moderate downside inclination.  I also produced a profit curve to see how this has played out over time.

A bit choppy, but it has been headed lower for a long time.  Traders may want to be a little cautious about jumping aboard the "Turnaround Tuesday" train today.  The market has historically struggled between open and close under similar scenarios.
