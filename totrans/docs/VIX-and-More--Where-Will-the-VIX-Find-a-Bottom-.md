# VIX and More: Where Will the VIX Find a Bottom?

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/10/where-will-vix-find-bottom.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/10/where-will-vix-find-bottom.html#0001-01-01)

![](img/6c64013378d227905893c95300dbf2b1.png)Let me start out by stating for the record that I have no idea whether it is appropriate to use traditional charting and other technical analysis techniques to attempt to determine support and resistance levels for the VIX.  After all, the VIX is a [multi-generational derivative](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/05/vix-futures-starter-kit.html) that is a good distance removed from reality.  For purposes of simplification, think of the VIX as a shadow puppet (more accurately, the composite shadow puppet from 500 simultaneous light sources); if we want to learn more about it, should we study the shadows or consider the hands from which the shadows are cast?  I have a tendency to talk about the shadows, but for charting purposes I am inclined to believe that they are still just shadows.

So…with that backhanded disclaimer out of the way, let me turn my attention to a VIX that just made an intra-day low of 16.63.  Whether that number sounds high or low depends upon where you have been [anchoring](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring) a ‘normal’ price in your mind.  At 16.63, the VIX is 68% above the year’s low (9.87), 56% below the year’s high (37.50), and about 7% above the VIX’s lifetime mean, which stands at 18.93.

I recently [made a guesstimate](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/09/vix-oversold.html) that the VIX would bottom in the 16-17 range in October and I have no reason to depart from that thinking.  I will, however, offer the weekly chart of the VIX below as one way to think about that 16-17 support range.  Instead of the long-term moving averages (which may look interesting, but are of dubious value), focus instead on the Williams %R number.  When the %R crosses below -80, it has a tendency to signal a bottoming out in the VIX – to the extent that you can tell when a shadow puppet is bottoming out…
