## Design is a job

Excellent presentation title 🙂 “13 Ways Designers [Screw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXXKqwrEql4) Up Client Presentations”.  If you can’t set context and present your ideas, your pretty much dead in the water.  Watch the presentation, and read the [book](http://abookapart.com/products/design-is-a-job).  Probably worth a watch/[read](http://muledesign.com/2014/09/13-ways-designers-screw-up-client-presentations) by anyone that needs to present to clients – standard consulting stuff.  High up on my list is the second bullet points in Mike’s [article](http://muledesign.com/2014/09/13-ways-designers-screw-up-client-presentations), “Not getting off your ass”:

> Being on your feet will allow you to walk from person to person as they ask questions, simultaneously making you look more confident and allowing for more intimacy.
> It should go without saying that you dressed nicely and your hands are out of your pockets
