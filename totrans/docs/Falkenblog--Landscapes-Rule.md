Data suggest people from all cultures tend to like landscapes. These painting have open spaces, with big trees with branches towards the ground, a river, a view between two mountains, animals, flowering and fruiting plants, and lastly, a path that one can follow. Thus, modern artists take note: in 100 years no one will care about your avant guard take on man's inhumanity to man, or his banality, as represented by a bunch of soup cans. It's funny listening to this guy note that people though art demand was much more culture dependent.
