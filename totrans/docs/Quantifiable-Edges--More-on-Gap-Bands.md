# Quantifiable Edges: More on Gap Bands

> 来源：[http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2008/05/more-on-gap-bands.html#0001-01-01](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2008/05/more-on-gap-bands.html#0001-01-01)

A few nights ago I looked at upside gaps outside of Bollinger Bands for SPY. Tonight I will show them along with downside gaps below Bollinger Bands. I am using the standard 20ma and 2 standard deviations bands for the study. As was pointed out, the band levels are fixed until the close, so the gap criteria is simply a gap beyond yesterday’s closing band. I tested using SPY going back to 7/1/98\. I’ll let the table speak for itself tonight.
