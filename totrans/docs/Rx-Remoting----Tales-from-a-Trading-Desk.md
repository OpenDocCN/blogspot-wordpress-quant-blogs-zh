# Rx Remoting? | Tales from a Trading Desk

## Rx Remoting?

If you’ve used [Rx](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/devlabs/ee794896.aspx) at all you’ll probably have come to the conclusion that its a useful and cool technology. What’s clear however is that I really want the ability for IObservable/IObserver to work inter-process – WCF .NET service layer to WPF client. I also want Silverlight [Local Message Receivers and Senders](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd833063(VS.95).aspx) to support Rx remoting, coupled with Azure Rx support. I wander if the Rx team have these items on their radar?
