# Humble Student of the Markets: China gets old AND rich, but...

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2021/12/china-gets-old-and-rich-but.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2021/12/china-gets-old-and-rich-but.html#0001-01-01)

China has a well-known demographic problem: its working population is aging quickly. For years, many analysts have rhetorically asked whether China can get rich before it gets old. 

We have the answer. A recent

[McKinsey study](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/the-rise-and-rise-of-the-global-balance-sheet-how-productively-are-we-using-our-wealth)

found that China has beaten the US to become the richest nation. McKinsey found that China’s wealth rose from $7 trillion in 2000 to an astounding $120 trillion in 2020\. By contrast, the US doubled its wealth to $90 trillion during the same period.

Be careful what you wish for. China becoming rich just as it begins to age is like the dog that caught the car but doesn’t know what to do next.
