# VIX and More: Availability Bias and Disaster Imprinting

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/11/availability-bias-and-disaster.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/11/availability-bias-and-disaster.html#0001-01-01)

After I dashed off [The VIX Spike Conundrum](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/11/vix-spike-conundrum.html), it occurred to me that there might be some aspects of [behavioral finance](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/behavioral%20finance) that have contributed to what is now a full year of continued overestimating of future volatility. I detailed this phenomenon in [The Gap Between the VIX and Realized Volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/08/gap-between-vix-and-realized-volatility.html) and is also being reflected in up in a [VIX:VXV ratio](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%3AVXV) that has been stuck at unusually low levels from mid-July until last week.

In thinking about the various elements of behavioral finance that impair ‘rational’ decision-making and could contribute to excess implied volatility, one factor that immediately comes to mind is [availability bias](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/availability%20bias) ([nicely summarized in Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic).) The global financial crisis and VIX spikes into the 80s were so vivid and memorable – and so thoroughly discussed in the media – that they are all too easy to recall one year later, even though arguably most of the risks associated with a VIX of 80 have since passed.

I do not think that availability bias is the only explanation for recent excess implied volatility. My working hypothesis – which I do not believe has been addressed by the behavioral finance crowd – is that another factor is as work. I call it “[disaster imprinting](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/disaster%20imprinting)” for lack of a better name. Disaster imprinting refers to a phenomenon in which the threats of financial and psychological disaster were so severe that they continue to leave a permanent or semi-permanent scar in one’s psyche. Another way to describe disaster imprinting might be to liken it to a low level financial post-traumatic stress disorder.

I will do some additional research to test the disaster imprinting theory, but for now I wanted to throw the idea out and see what others think. Has going to the brink of a global financial meltdown impaired our collective ability to assess future probabilities? If so, how long will this impairment last? As always, all comments are appreciated.
