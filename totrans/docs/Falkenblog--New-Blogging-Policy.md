# Falkenblog: New Blogging Policy

> 来源：[http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/new-blogging-policy.html#0001-01-01](http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/new-blogging-policy.html#0001-01-01)

Just fyi, I'm only going to do 1 post a week. I might have a brief one in between. I'm now pretty ensconced in an interesting full time job working on quantitative issues related to equities and their options, but I know enough not to discuss it directly. I can't write much about what I work on most of the day, and my opportunity cost of blogging has made daily posting impractical.

So, check in once a week, I appreciate any comments and read them all, even when I don't respond.
