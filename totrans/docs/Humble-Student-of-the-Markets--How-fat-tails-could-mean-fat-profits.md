# Humble Student of the Markets: How fat tails could mean fat profits

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2018/11/how-fat-tails-could-mean-fat-profits.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2018/11/how-fat-tails-could-mean-fat-profits.html#0001-01-01)

The CBOE Short-Term Volatility Index (VXST) measures volatility over a 9-days. In effect, it's the 9-day VIX, which measures 1-month volatility.

VXST closed at 21.17 last week. indicating that the market expects an annualized volatility of 21.17% over the next 9-days. When I translate that to a weekly volatility by taking the 52nd root (52 weeks in a year), it comes to 1.1%. That figure seems low for several reasons. First, the SPX rose 2.4% last week and its low to high range was 5.9%. The midterm elections on Tuesday could pose an unknown event risk. As well, we have an FOMC meeting on Wednesday and Thursday, which could also shake up markets.

The higher than normal probability of disruptive events creates fat tails for market returns. Fat tails could mean fat profits for traders.
