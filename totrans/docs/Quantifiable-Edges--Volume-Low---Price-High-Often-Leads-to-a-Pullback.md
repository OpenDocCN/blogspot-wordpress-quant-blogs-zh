# Quantifiable Edges: Volume Low & Price High Often Leads to a Pullback

> 来源：[http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2009/08/volume-low-price-high-often-leads-to.html#0001-01-01](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2009/08/volume-low-price-high-often-leads-to.html#0001-01-01)

The

[Quantifinder](http://www.quantifiableedges.com/quantifinderinfo.html)

came up with quite a few studies last. Below is one that last appeared in the June 15, 2009 Subscriber Letter. (Stats are updated through 8/13/09.)

This would suggest a pullback over the next few days is likely. While the pullback hasn’t necessarily been severe, it has been consistent.
