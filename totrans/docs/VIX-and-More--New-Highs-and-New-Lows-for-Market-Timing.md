# VIX and More: New Highs and New Lows for Market Timing

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/07/new-highs-and-new-lows-for-market.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/07/new-highs-and-new-lows-for-market.html#0001-01-01)

The [McClellan Summation Index](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/McClellan%20Summation%20Index), the subject of [yesterday’s](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/07/good-news-from-mcclellan-summation.html) market sentiment post, examines the difference between advancing and declining issues to help divine the future direction of the markets.

Today I am going to make the leap from daily advances and declines to daily new highs and lows covering a trailing 52 week period.

Before I dive in, I want to highlight the consistently excellent work of [Headline Charts](http://headlinecharts.blog.com/), a blog that regularly addresses issues such as advances and declines, new highs and new lows, as well as other market sentiment metrics.  Today is no exception, as Headline Charts [examines the ratio of new highs to new lows](http://headlinecharts.blog.com/1922433/) as well as the rarely seen inverse ratio, new lows to new highs.

I have also recently had the benefit of reading the encyclopedic and aptly titled market breadth tome, [The Complete Guide to Market Breadth Indicators: How to Analyze and Evaluate Market Direction and Strength](http://www.amazon.com/Complete-Guide-Market-Breadth-Indicators/dp/0071444432/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/103-6386437-2275810?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1184168902&sr=8-1) by [Gregory L. Morris](http://www.amazon.com/gp/blog/AEICKL7FYL11X).  This is obviously a labor of love and an indispensable resource for thinking not only about market breadth, but indicators of all types.  Think of it more as a reference book than something to curl up with and you can get a better sense of its ideal application.

Spurred on by Morris’ research and analysis, I have been evaluating a number of market breadth indicators and am currently favoring a rather simple one for the intermediate term: new highs minus new lows, with a 4 day EMA smoother. One simple rule is to be long when the EMA is positive and short when it is negative.  You can use a longer EMA or a SMA to smooth out the values a little more and cut down on whipsaws, but I like the 4 day EMA and will be adding this indicator to my short list of favorites.

You will note that the new high – new low indicator is currently recommending a long position in the markets, with a considerable cushion before it is likely to reverse.
