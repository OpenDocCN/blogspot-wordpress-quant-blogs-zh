Considering the world will end at 6 pm local time today, you should remember the South Park episode '

[Probably](http://www.southparkstudios.com/full-episodes/s04e11-probably)

', where everyone goes to hell. At one point the newcomers to Hell are being informed they were damned. One guy says 'hey, wait a minute, I shouldn't be here, I was a totally strict and devout Protestant, I thought we went to heaven?' The tour guide says 'you picked the wrong religion.' The correct group ... Mormons! I'm hoping that's not how it goes down, but we'll see soon enough.
