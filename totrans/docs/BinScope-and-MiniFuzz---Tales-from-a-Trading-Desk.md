## BinScope and MiniFuzz

*   [BinScope](http://edge.technet.com/Media/binscope-overview-and-demo/) – verification tool that analyzes binaries on a project-wide level to ensure that they have been built in compliance with Microsoft’s Security Development Lifecycle (SDL)
*   [MiniFuzz](http://edge.technet.com/Media/minifuzz-overview-and-demo/) – a very simple fuzzer designed to ease adoption of fuzz testing by non-security people who are unfamiliar with file fuzzing tools or have never used them in their current software development processes
