# iOS: Native vs HTML5 | Tales from a Trading Desk

## iOS: Native vs HTML5

The HTML5 umbrella bandwagon has always caused a debate between whether to build an iPad/iPhone app in native iOS or HTML5.  Historically, native iOS has usually offered better performance, even though there is the Objective-C hurdle to overcome.  Facebook’s [recent](http://www.macnewsworld.com/story/76007.html) move away from HTML5 to native iOS reflects this view.  Thus, its interesting to see that the iPhone 5 A6 processor is doing rather well on the JavaScript benchmarking tool if the [AppleInsider](http://appleinsider.com/articles/12/09/19/apple_a6_soc_outperforms_intel_atom_in_javascript_test) article is to be believed.  Curious to see if this aids the HTML5 bandwagon 🙂
