# VIX and More: Thinking Sideways But Volatile? Consider MCN…

![](img/f6a55cdfa3bd0dde40bb7a7b0a010e5e.png)Until further notice, I am going to consider this a sideways market instead of trying to guess whether the next big move will be up or down.

In terms of trading implications, this means selling volatility in the form of [bear spreads](http://www.optionsxpress.com/educate/strategies/bearcallspread.aspx), iron [condors](http://www.optionsxpress.com/educate/strategies/condor.aspx), iron [butterflies](http://www.optionsxpress.com/educate/strategies/butterfly.aspx), short [strangles](http://www.optionsxpress.com/educate/strategies/strangle.aspx), short [straddles](http://www.optionsxpress.com/educate/strategies/straddle.aspx), selling an occasional [naked call](http://www.optionsxpress.com/educate/strategies/nakedcall.aspx), and even that old standby, [covered calls](http://www.optionsxpress.com/educate/strategies/coveredcalls.aspx).

If you are not a regular options seller, many of these strategies can seem daunting, risky, expensive, and a lot of work.  While this can be the case, there is an easy way: a covered call fund or ETF.  I have prominently mentioned [BEP](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=bep) here in the past.  BEP, also known as the S&P 500 Covered Call Fund, is a [closed-end fund](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-end_fund) that does exactly what the fund’s name says.  I am increasingly becoming more of a fan of another closed-end fund that is very similar: the [Madison/Claymore Covered Call and Equity Strategy Fund (MCN)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=mcn).  This fund trades a little more actively than BEP, appears to be a little more flexible in its [investment approach](http://www.madisonclaymore.com/fundsummary.aspx) than BEP, and carries a current dividend yield of 11.5%.

In a sideways market where investors fear a lot of volatility, I’ll take 11.5% and a chance to participate in an up move any day…
