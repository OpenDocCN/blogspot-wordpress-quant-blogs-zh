The

[Spring Issue of the Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy](http://www.harvard-jlpp.com/archive/#332)

has many good articles on the economic crisis of 2008\. It's pretty good. I really liked

[Arnold Kling's article](http://www.harvard-jlpp.com/33-2/507.pdf)

, which argues the crisis was the result of a cognitive error--that home mortgages weren't risky irrespective of obligor risk--due to a confluence of factors: complexity, good intentions, regulations, simple carelessness.

Yet, he states this "may be our first epistemologically‐driven depression [ie, they didn't understand what they were doing]". I'm not so sure. The internet bubble of the 1990's also contained a lot of pervasive misconceptions that with hindsight are obvious.
