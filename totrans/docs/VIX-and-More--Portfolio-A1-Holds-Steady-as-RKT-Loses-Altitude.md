# VIX and More: Portfolio A1 Holds Steady as RKT Loses Altitude

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/05/portfolio-a1-holds-steady-as-rkt-loses.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/05/portfolio-a1-holds-steady-as-rkt-loses.html#0001-01-01)

For the second week in a row, at least one Portfolio A1 holding fell 10% during the week.  Last week it was [Tesoro (TSO)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=tso&hl=en), which continued to recover this week; the most recent victim is [Rock-Tenn (RKT)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=rkt&hl=en), whose fall was offset almost imperceptibly by a $0.10 dividend paid out on 5/21.  While RKT has been a strong performer since being added to the portfolio during the first week in March, the recent weakness makes this holding vulnerable to being dropped in the coming weeks.

In spite of RKT’s difficult week, Portfolio A1 has increased its performance advantage over the benchmark S&P 500 to 2.2%.

There are no changes to the portfolio for the coming week.

A snapshot of the portfolio is as follows:
