Thanksgiving has shown some pretty consistent seasonality over the years.  

[On Monday I showed a table](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2013/11/an-updated-look-at-thanksgiving-week.html)

breaking returns down by day of the week.  Both the Wednesday before and the Friday after have exhibited bullish tendencies while the Monday after has been somewhat bearish.  Today I decided to show a profit curve that represents simply owning the SPX from Tuesday's close through Wednesday's close.

Appears to be an impressive looking upslope.  Happy Thanksgiving!
