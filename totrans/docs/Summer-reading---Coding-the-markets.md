## Summer reading

### September 11, 2007

Over the summer I’ve been reading “Invisible Engines” by Evans et al. Strongly recommended for all with an interest in the software business. It’s prompted me into a re-reading of Charles Ferguson’s extraordinary “High Stakes, No Prisoners”, which I’m enjoying even more than the first time. Ferguson’s book was written in 99 about events that took place five years previously. From the vantage point of 2007 it seems even more insightful.
