## Oslo Language, Midori and More

*   “Oslo” [language](http://channel9.msdn.com/pdc2008/TL%2027/) is one of the many PDC [sessions](http://channel9.msdn.com/pdc2008/TL%2023/) that will be worth watching.
*   Geva has a curious posting on [GigaSpaces and the Economics of Cloud Computing](http://gevaperry.typepad.com/main/2008/07/gigaspaces-and.html)
*   [NetMap](http://www.codeplex.com/NetMap) – a set of .NET Framework 2.0 class libraries that can be used to add network graphs to custom applications.
*   F# [CTP](http://blogs.msdn.com/chrsmith/archive/2008/07/28/countdown-to-f-ctp.aspx)
*   More details on [Midori](http://www.sdtimes.com/MICROSOFT_S_PLANS_FOR_POST_WINDOWS_OS_REVEALED/About_CLOUDCOMPUTING_and_MOBILEDEVELOPMENT_and_NET_and_SOASAAS_and_SOFTWAREDEVELOPMENT_and_WINDOWS_and_MICROSOFT/32627) (“asynchronous-only architecture that is built for task concurrency and parallel use of local and distributed resources, with a distributed component-based and data-driven application model, and dynamic management of power and other resources”). Midori sounds promising assuming this article is true, and assuming (big) that Microsoft can deliver this side of 2015.
*   This [article](http://www.sdtimes.com/MICROSOFT_MAPS_OUT_MIGRATION_FROM_WINDOWS/About_VIRTUALIZATION_and_WINDOWS_and_MICROSOFT/32646) appears to concur with my that Windows compatability is a real issue, and needs to be broken in the future. “astonishingly ambitious undertaking” is an under statements, especially given the history of what Microsoft has been able to release. Lets hope Midori does materialise sometime soon.
*   WCF Visualizers [Tool](http://www.codeplex.com/WCFVisualizer)
*   Bad Locking [Patterns](http://blogs.msdn.com/oanapl/archive/2008/07/28/bad-locking-patterns.aspx) – I’m still amazed at the number of people that still use lock(this)
