# Humble Student of the Markets: Peering into 2020 and beyond

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2019/02/peering-into-2020-and-beyond.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2019/02/peering-into-2020-and-beyond.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models**

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post,

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The

**Trend Model**

is an asset allocation model which applies trend following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or contraction (bearish)?"

My inner trader uses a

**trading model**

, which is a blend of price momentum (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa). Subscribers receive real-time alerts of model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of the those email alerts are updated weekly

[here](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/trading-track-record/)

. The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that began in March 2016 is shown below.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Sell equities*
*   Trend Model signal: Neutral*
*   Trading model: Bullish*

** The performance chart and model readings have been delayed by a week out of respect to our paying subscribers.* **Update schedule**

**Gazing into the crystal ball**

In the past year, I have been fortunate to be right on the major turning points in the US equity market. I was steadfastly bullish in early 2018 after the correction (see

[Five reasons not to worry, plus two concerns](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2018/02/11/five-reasons-not-to-worry-plus-2-concerns/)

). I turned cautious in early August because of the early technical warning, which was accompanied by deterioration in top-down data (see

[Market top ahead? My inner investor turns cautious](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2018/08/05/major-top-ahead-my-inner-investor-turns-cautious/)

). Finally, I turned bullish on stocks in mid-January 2019 (see

[Ursus Interruptus](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2019/01/13/ursus-interruptus/)

).

What's next, as I gaze into the crystal ball for 2020 and beyond?

**A Special Announcement**

We told you so. We told you the market was going down.

Here is the track of

***Humble Student of the Markets***

, where we are neither perma-bulls nor perma-bears. Most recently, we have been correctly bullish since the correction of 2015, and turned cautious in August 2018 (see

[Market top ahead? My inner investor turns cautious,](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2018/08/05/major-top-ahead-my-inner-investor-turns-cautious/)

August 5, 2018).

We were also timely at the 2009 bottom. We issued a call to buy beaten up low-priced stocks with high insider buying a week before the ultimate bottom (see

[Phoenix rising?](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2009/02/phoenix-rising.html)

 February 24, 2009).

***The out-of-sample record of our model trading portfolio in 2018 was up 42.9%***

. For more details, see our weekly updates
