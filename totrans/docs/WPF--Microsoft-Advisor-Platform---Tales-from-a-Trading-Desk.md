## WPF: Microsoft Advisor Platform

Over the last day or so I’ve been helping Stevan Vidich (Industry Architect, Microsoft Financial Services) create a special build of one of Lab49’s WPF demo’s for inclusion within [Microsoft’s Advisor Platform](http://www.microsoft.com/industry/financialservices/advisorplatform.mspx) (wealth management). Hopefully I’ll get a demo of the Advisor Platform next week.
