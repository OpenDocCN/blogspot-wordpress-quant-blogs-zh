## Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) – Bytecode On The Blockchain

If your interested in smart contracts, its probably worth having a read of the [Greeter](https://www.ethereum.org/greeter) tutorial over at Ethereum.  Likewise, [Writing Contacts](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Contracts-and-Transactions) on their wiki.  There’s also the online [Solidity realtime compiler and runtime](https://chriseth.github.io/browser-solidity/) which is useful.  Interesting times.

Effectively we have [JavaScript](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/what-is-webassembly-the-dawn-of-a-new-era-61256ec5a8f6) as the browser VM, we have the JVM (and to a lesser extent .NET) as the server VM, and now we’re about to get blockchain VM’s.
