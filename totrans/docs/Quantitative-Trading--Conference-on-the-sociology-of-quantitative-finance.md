# Quantitative Trading: Conference on the sociology of quantitative finance

A new conference called

[Psi-Q](http://www.psi-q.org/)

will be held in London this June, featuring luminaries in the academic quantitative finance world, as well as risk and fund managers from various banks and hedge funds. Example topics:

*   How did shared beliefs, practices, ways of calculating, and technical systems impact evaluation of asset-backed securities and CDOs before and during the credit crises?
*   **Was that Lucky or Good? Creating a framework for skill attribution in finance, business management and other risky endeavors**.
*   The “backing out” phenomena observed in options markets:  how traders use models to imply independent variables consistent with market observed pricing, and where enough traders can be wrong about the expected results and the backed-out positions can send the wrong message.

Sounds like an interesting bird's eye view of quantitative finance.
