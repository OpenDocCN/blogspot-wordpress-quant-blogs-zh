## LinkedIn Data Leakage

“LinkedIn serves up resumes of 27,000 US intelligence personnel” [article](http://www.zdnet.com/article/linkedin-serves-up-resumes-of-27000-us-intelligence-personnel/) offers insight into how social networks can be used to get access to confidential data – architecture, technology stacks, and more can often be found by piecing together various social data without needing to walk though an office door and ask a single question.  As referenced in the article, its worrying to find that the US intelligence community is clearly incapable of keeping “secret codewords and surveillance programs” out of resumes.

Given that financial services is big on keeping business secret, it would be interesting to leverage [Transparency](https://transparencytoolkit.org/tools/) Toolkit’s to [see](https://github.com/TransparencyToolkit/JSONToNetworkGraph) what is [available](https://github.com/TransparencyToolkit/LookingGlass) 🙂
