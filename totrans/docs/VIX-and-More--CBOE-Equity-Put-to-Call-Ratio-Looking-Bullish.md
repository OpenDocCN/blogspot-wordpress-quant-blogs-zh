# VIX and More: CBOE Equity Put to Call Ratio Looking Bullish

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/06/cboe-equity-put-to-call-ratio-looking.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/06/cboe-equity-put-to-call-ratio-looking.html#0001-01-01)

Based on one of the ways I like to apply the [CBOE Equity Put to Call Ratio](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/CPCE), this ratio has just turned bullish for the first time [since late April](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/05/cboe-equity-put-to-call-ratio-no-longer.html).  Like any indicator, [put to call ratios](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/put%20to%20call) are far from infallible, but looking at historical context, there is a good possibility that the recent surge in put activity will be enough bricks in the wall of worry to provide a base for another bullish move from current levels.

Given that most of the other indicators I follow have a more neutral outlook, it will be interesting to see how this plays out.
