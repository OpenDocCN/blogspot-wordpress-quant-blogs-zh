# Humble Student of the Markets: Things you don't see at market bottoms, 23-Jun-2017 edition

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2017/06/things-you-dont-see-at-market-bottoms.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2017/06/things-you-dont-see-at-market-bottoms.html#0001-01-01)

It is said that while bottoms are events, but tops are processes. Translated, markets bottom out when panic sets in, and therefore they can be more easily identifiable. By contrast, market tops form when a series of conditions come together, but not necessarily all at the same time.

I have stated that while I don't believe that the stock market has made its final cyclical top, we are in the late stages of a bull market (see

[Risks are rising, but THE TOP is still ahead](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2017/06/18/risks-are-rising-but-the-top-is-still-ahead/)

). Nevertheless, psychology is getting a little frothy, which represent the pre-condition for a major top.

As a result, I am starting a one in an occasional series of lists of "things you don't see at market bottoms":

*   Argentina's 100-year bond offering
*   Irrational Exuberance Indicator at fresh highs
*   The E*Trade Indicator flashes a warning
*   More signs of excesses from the Chinese debt time bomb
