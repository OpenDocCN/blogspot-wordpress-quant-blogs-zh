# Humble Student of the Markets: Some sober second thoughts during the party

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2013/01/some-sober-second-thoughts-during-party.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2013/01/some-sober-second-thoughts-during-party.html#0001-01-01)

As I write these words, most equity markets are melting up between 1% and 2% in Asia and Europe in the wake of the news of a "fiscal cliff" deal in the US Congress. While my

[Inflation-Deflation Trend Allocation Model](http://qwestfunds.com/publications/newsletters_pdf/2009_issues/newsletter_november_2009.pdf)

remains in at an "inflation" reading indicating a risk-on environment, I am a very nervous bull.

Here are some thoughts to ponder:

*   Doesn't this deal set the United States up for more political drama at the end of February? ***Two months isn't a long time, even for a trader.***
*   The payroll tax cut didn't get extended, which is an effective tax increase on the middle class. ***What will happen to consumer spending and consumer confidence? Isn't this contractionary for the economy?***

Cullen Roche at

[Pragmatic Capitalism](http://pragcap.com/early-thoughts-on-the-fiscal-cliff-deal)

concluded that [emphasis added]:

*   If my rough math is right we’re looking at something in the range of $225B in cuts out of a potential $575B.
*   ***The total drag on the economy (using the CBO’s fiscal multipliers and Goldman Sachs estimates)*** ***is ~1.3%***.

I know that risky assets are rallying in relief because it could have been worse, much worse, but isn't a 1.3% drag on the economy bad?

Don't get me wrong, I turned more positive on risky assets in November and have gotten increasingly bullish ever since. I am long and I am enjoying this party. Nevertheless, I am edging closer to the exit and keeping an eye for the cops, who will no doubt raid the joint.
