# Humble Student of the Markets: What I learned about Fed policy this week

Rather than indulge in instant analysis, I wanted to give myself a few days to reflect on Janet Yellen's speech on Monday (see

[full transcript](http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20160606a.htm)

). In doing so, I learned a number of things about Fed policy that I didn't know before:

*   How much does the Fed want to raise before it considers rates to be "normalized"
*   What it means to allow the economy to run a little "hot" because of slack in the labor markets
*   What the hurdles are to next raise rates
*   From Ben Bernanke: The debate over how to implement the Phillips Curve in monetary policy
