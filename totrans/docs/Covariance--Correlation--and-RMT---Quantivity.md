# Covariance, Correlation, and RMT | Quantivity

> 来源：[https://quantivity.wordpress.com/2011/06/05/covariance-correlation-and-random-matrix-theory/#0001-01-01](https://quantivity.wordpress.com/2011/06/05/covariance-correlation-and-random-matrix-theory/#0001-01-01)

As previously exemplified by [basket prediction](https://quantivity.wordpress.com/2010/08/22/high-frequency-prediction-via-rmt-pca/), Quantivity is finding increasingly frequent use of random matrix theory (RMT), particularly in context of portfolio / basket covariance and correlation analysis across all trading frequencies. Although undoubtedly an exaggeration, RMT is beginning to feel like PCA did in the 1990s.

Below is a survey of RMT literature to whet readers’ appetite. Readers are requested to suggest additional relevant literature in comments. Subsequent posts may delve into more details on practical use of RMT, pending reader interest.

To begin, the following are modern book-length treatments of RMT:

The following are extended survey articles (focused on theory and numerical analysis, respectively), available online:

The following are applied RMT articles, in published chronological order:

These articles nicely illustrate the evolution in application of RMT, both in breadth and sophistication, over the past decade.
