I had to do an in-depth examination of a Java AppServer that our group has written in order to do some prelimiary integration of my .NET client-side framework. I finally have had a chance to do some in-depth work with Eclipse, and there is definitely a lot of goodness in it.

I have to admit that there are a lot of positives about being in the Java world. I like the

[Java Community Process](http://jcp.org/en/home/index)

, and the fact that major functionality is discussed in the open before the spec is drafted. There is a lot that Microsoft can learn from this.
