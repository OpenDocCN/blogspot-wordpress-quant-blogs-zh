David,
Very informative, just one question: in the spreadsheet, the ATR column is not the simple average over the previous 10 days, rather it is 9*(yesterdays ATR) plus todays TR, all divided by 10\. I assume the spreadsheet reflects your true intention, but wanted to confirm. Also, could I ask why you calculate this way?
