# Continuous Delivery Coding Patterns | Tales from a Trading Desk

## Continuous Delivery Coding Patterns

Yet anther resource off InfoQ, “Continuous Delivery [Overview](https://www.infoq.com/minibooks/continuous-delivery-overview)” married with “Continuous Delivery Coding [Patterns](https://www.infoq.com/articles/continuous-delivery-coding-patterns): Latent-to-Live Code & Forward Compatible Interim Versions”.

Trunk-based-development ([TBD](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/enabling-trunk-based-development-deployment-pipelines)) is probably one of the main chances that teams need to get their head around if today they are working off branches.

Latent-to-live code pattern is in my view the only sensible road, since until your code get into production, there is zero Return-on-Investment (ROI)
