# VIX and More: Chart of the Week: Gold

In a week in which most securities drifted lower on uninspired volume, [gold](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/gold) was a notable exception, jumping 4.1% as tensions between India and Pakistan increasingly point toward the possibility of a military confrontation while violence in the Gaza Strip between Israel and Hamas is escalating.

Against the backdrop of potential conflict in either Gaza or the India-Pakistan region, gold surged above the critical 840 mark and ended the week at 871\. As the uppermost of the two dashed black lines in the [chart of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week) shows, resistance from previous November-December 2007 highs was pierced this week. Gold also broke out of a down trending channel (solid black lines) this week and is now setting up for a possible large bullish move. If gold continues to rise, look for gold miners ([GDX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/GDX)) to be even more volatile and likely outperform the commodity or the popular gold bullion ETF, [GLD](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/GLD).
