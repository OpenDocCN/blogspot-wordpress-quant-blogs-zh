# Job Title “Engineer” – Back in Fashion? | Tales from a Trading Desk

## Job Title “Engineer” – Back in Fashion?

In my view people waste way to much time of achieving titles in their career, rather than concentrating on doing stuff well during their career.  Historically it feels like the “engineering” title has over the last time period, been a bit of a dirty word.  Reading Matt Welsh’s [posting](http://matt-welsh.blogspot.co.uk/2013/04/running-software-team-at-google.html) on “Running a software team at Google” and listening to a few low latency pod casts, made me wonder if “engineer” was the new best job title?

As an aside, if you missed the fact that TS-Associates has [integrated](http://www.ts-a.com/Application-Tap-News/ts-associates-announces-application-tap-for-solarflare.html) their application tap technology into the Solarflare cards.
