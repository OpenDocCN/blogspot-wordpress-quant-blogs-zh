I have been considering asking my team to start exploring Oslo and M in order to create a DSL for automated testing of all of our systems, including the entire workflow for our Equity Derivatives traders. But, Microsoft's (non) strategy around Oslo, M, and Quadrant has me looking elsewhere .... back to the old standbys of Yacc/Lex or Antlr.

I have been out of the CEP business for the past year, but other than Matt Davey of 7-Squared using SI for a demo, has anybody else been exploring or using StreamInsight in Capital Markets?
