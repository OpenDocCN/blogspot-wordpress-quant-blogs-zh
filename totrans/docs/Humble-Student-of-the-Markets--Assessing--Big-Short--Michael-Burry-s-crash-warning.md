[Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.in/stock-market/news/big-short-investor-michael-burry-warned-the-biggest-market-bubble-in-history-would-end-with-the-mother-of-all-crashes-he-just-hinted-the-collapse-is-now-underway-/articleshow/93929011.cms)

> Doomsday is finally here, he hinted in a since-deleted tweet this week.

> The fund manager of "The Big Short" fame shared a screenshot of a S&P 500 chart, showing the benchmark stock-market index has tumbled 18% from its December peak, despite several blistering rallies this year.
