**Mid-week market update**

: In my update last weekend (see

[Waiting for the sell signal](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2022/01/09/waiting-for-the-sell-signal/)

), I observed that the S&P 500 was oversold and due for a relief rally. The market cooperated by printing a

on Monday, which is a capitulative reversal indicator, and confirmed the reversal with a bullish follow through on Tuesday by recapturing the 50-day moving average. The index finished the move today with a

, which indicates possible indecision.
