# Humble Student of the Markets: A dead cat bounce, or something more?

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2019/06/a-dead-cat-bounce-or-something-more.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2019/06/a-dead-cat-bounce-or-something-more.html#0001-01-01)

**Mid-week market update**

: I wrote last week that the market gods were favoring the equity bulls, The relief rally would likely last about another week (see

[How far can this rally run?](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2019/06/05/how-far-can-this-rally-run-2/)

), but the market is likely to remain range-bound until the trade tensions are resolved.

> In conclusion, until these trade tensions are resolved, expect the market to remain range-bound and move in reaction to the latest headlines. This suggests that traders should adopt a position of “buy the dips” and “sell the rips”. If history is any guide, I expect the current rally to peter out some time next week, with the most probable peak occurring about mid-week.

The market has rallied substantially since last Wednesday. It is now mid-week, and the market appears to be stalling at resistance. Is this simply a test and pullback to test resistance, or something worse?

What's next?
