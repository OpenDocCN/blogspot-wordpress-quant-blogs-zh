# Magmasystems Blog: Flying with Rich

I went flying this past weekend with Rich. It was very windy. It was so windy that, when we pointed the nose directly into the wind and put down the flaps, we were able to make the plane go backwards in the air.

Rich flew co-pilot in my Mooney 20G. Rich owns a very big mutual fund. Rich has a [TBM 700](http://www.socata.eads.net/1024/en/aircraft/TBM%20700/TBM700.html). I hope I fly Rich's plane some day.

My wife always asks "Why don't you work for Rich?" I say that friends and business never mix, and friendship is always more important. Silly Marc.
