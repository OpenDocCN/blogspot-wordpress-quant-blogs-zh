# Humble Student of the Markets: The stealth breakout you may have missed

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2024/03/the-stealth-breakout-you-may-have-missed.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2024/03/the-stealth-breakout-you-may-have-missed.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models** 

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post, 

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The 

**Trend Asset Allocation Model**

 is an asset allocation model that applies trend-following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity prices. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. The performance and full details of a model portfolio based on the out-of-sample signals of the Trend Model can be found

[here](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/trend-model-report-card/)

.

My inner trader uses a 

**trading model**

, which is a blend of price momentum (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa). Subscribers receive real-time alerts of model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of the email alerts is updated weekly 

[here](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/trading-track-record/)

. The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that began in March 2016 is shown below.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Buy equities (Last changed from “sell” on 28-Jul-2023)*
*   Trend Model signal: Bullish (Last changed from “neutral” on 28-Jul-2023)*
*   Trading model: Neutral (Last changed from “bullish” on 24-Jan-2024)*

#### A convincing breakout at 2100

While GDX may be a little extended in the short run, I would like to point out the long-term potential in gold. Gold has staged a convincing upside breakout from a multi-month cup and handle formation. Moreover, the gold-to-S&P 500 ratio (bottom panel) is turning up from a multi-year saucer-shaped bottom, indicating the possible start of a new relative bull for gold over stocks. As well, the breakout has occurred with little fanfare as investors have been focused on AI and GLP-1 plays. This combination of breakout and lack of public participation suggests a substantial upside potential.
