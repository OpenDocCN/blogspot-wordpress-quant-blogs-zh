# VIX and More: Economic Data Trends in Advance of Nonfarm Payrolls

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/08/economic-data-trends-in-advance-of.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/08/economic-data-trends-in-advance-of.html#0001-01-01)

A little over a month ago, in [Trends in Economic Data Relative to Expectations](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/07/trends-in-economic-data-relative-to.html), I first posted a slightly different version of the chart below on the blog. The chart turned out to be a surprise hit, so this time around I am updating the data (a proprietary methodology in which I evaluate the performance of key economic data releases relative to consensus expectations) as well as adding the S&P 500 index as a beige area graphic.

In terms of takeaways, deteriorating [employment](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/nonfarm%20payrolls) and consumer data continue to drag down the economic recovery. Manufacturing, which was an area of strength early in the year, has more recently become a source of weakness. In terms of strength, I continue to be surprised that the aggregated construction and [housing](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/housing) numbers are better than consensus estimates.

For additional details on the data included in each grouping, refer to the link above.
