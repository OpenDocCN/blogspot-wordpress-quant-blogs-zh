Toyota is doing damage control, primarily because the

is so horrifying, so vivid, they figure they will lose that case no matter what. But I remember a big brouhaha back in the 80's on 'sudden acceleration syndrome', and the more investigative reporters investigated, the more evidence they found it existed! But in the end, as many people swore on their bible that they were hitting the brake, it turned out that 'pedal misapplication' was the problem. The key is to put the brake on the other side of the car, as in Medicare-mobiles like Cadillac.

PJ O'Roarke discussed this way back in his really funny book,

[Parliament of the Whores](http://books.google.com/books?id=1Kn1VP4TX-gC&pg=PA87&lpg=PA87&dq=audi+5000+pj+o'rourke&source=bl&ots=VJJ60lp_CN&sig=1C9ncw3mKbGx4eQiN1IbNXfcpl4&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=2&ct=result#v=onepage&q=&f=false)
