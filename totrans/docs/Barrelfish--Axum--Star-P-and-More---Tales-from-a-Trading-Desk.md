## Barrelfish, Axum, Star-P and More

*   Looks like Microsoft is pushing on multiple fronts (as expected) to find the correct road for Windows to follow in the future. [Barrelfish](http://www.codenamewindows.com/?p=767) is yet another product from [MSR](http://www.barrelfish.org/barrelfish_hotos09.pdf).

*   GigaSpaces solution to the Poison Message [problem](http://jeroenremmerswaal.blogspot.com/2009/08/gigaspaces-solution-to-poison-message.html)
*   [Microsoft](http://blogs.technet.com/windowsserver/archive/2009/09/21/microsoft-has-acquired-the-technology-assets-of-interactive-supercomputing-isc.aspx) [acquired](http://www.infoworld.com/t/hpc-high-performance-computing/microsoft-acquisition-adds-parallel-computing-focus-893?source=rss_infoworld_news) the technology assets of Interactive Supercomputing (ISC). I guess the Star-P [technology](http://74.125.153.132/search?q=cache:Oen84V9gnskJ:www.interactivesupercomputing.com/products/+Star-P&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk) is heading for [HPC](http://www.microsoft.com/hpc/en/us/default.aspx) and Azure
*   Linq to Mocks is [finally](http://www.clariusconsulting.net/blogs/kzu/archive/2009/08/13/164978.aspx) born
