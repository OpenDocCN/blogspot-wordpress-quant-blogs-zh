# Magmasystems Blog: Sunguard Consulting Services

People have been coming to me with news of a new consulting company ... Sunguard Consulting Company (I thought that Sunguard already had a consulting company).

Looks like Chris Conte saw some value in my old employer, and made an offer. But, according to my various sources, the only catch is that 50% of the consultants have to stay in order for the deal to go through.

Are Lab49 and Infusion next? They would certainly make a tasty snack for Larry Ellison.
