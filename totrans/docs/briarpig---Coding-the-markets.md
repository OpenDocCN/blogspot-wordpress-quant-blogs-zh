### May 30, 2008

A little off topic, but it’s worth noting that the author of the treedragon and erys sites is back with [briarpig](http://briarpig.com/index.html), and lots on [hardcore C++](http://briarpig.com/tech/refcounting.html) performance engineering. Which, come to think of it, is highly relevant to etrading.
