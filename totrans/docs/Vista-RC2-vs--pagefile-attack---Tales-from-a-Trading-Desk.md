# Vista RC2 vs. pagefile attack | Tales from a Trading Desk

## Vista RC2 vs. pagefile attack

[invisiblethings](http://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.com) has tested Vista RC2 against the [pagefile attack](http://invisiblethings.org/papers/joanna%20rutkowska%20-%20subverting%20vista%20kernel.ppt) finding that Microsoft has taken the easy road to blocking the attack. Her posting even suggest how to work about the block 😉 I’m guessing Microsoft took the easy road due to lack of time, and the need to RTM Vista. However as with most easy solution, they could pay the price at a later date.
