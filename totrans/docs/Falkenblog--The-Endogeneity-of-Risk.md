So, in only 10 years a major asset class transmogrifies from safest to riskiest. The underwriting (credit risk minimums and money down payment), the loss-in-event-of-default assumption (new legal risks), the 'willingness to pay', and collateral price volatility, have all changed significantly. Perhaps this is all endogenous, that a 'safe' asset like mortgages must become risky because everyone--investors, mortgage issuers, home builders, legislators, non-profits--all see it as a vehicle to achieve various ends.
