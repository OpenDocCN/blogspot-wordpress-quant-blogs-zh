New York Times article of

[what happens inside a cancer cell](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/25/science/25visual.html)

(The outer ring would be a heatmap of sector movement, the next inner ring would be the current volumes, the next inner rings might show trading movements from one sector to another,...)
