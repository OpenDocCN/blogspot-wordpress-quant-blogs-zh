out.

I am not a guitarist nor do I really like the blues, but like everyone else who saw this on YouTube, it hit me in the right place. I actually saw Roy years ago when a school chum got tickets to a taping of ABC's In Concert TV Series. The bill was Uriah Heep, Roy, The Persuasions, and Savoy Brown. Roy blew everyone away.

I continue to be astounded by the things I find on YouTube. My YouTube id is VanderTop2, so you can browse my Favorites list and see what kind of things I am unearthing.
