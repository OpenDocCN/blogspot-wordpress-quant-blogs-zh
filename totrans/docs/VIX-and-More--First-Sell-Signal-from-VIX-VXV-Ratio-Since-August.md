# VIX and More: First Sell Signal from VIX:VXV Ratio Since August

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/12/first-sell-signal-from-vixvxv-ratio-in.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/12/first-sell-signal-from-vixvxv-ratio-in.html#0001-01-01)

The [VIX:VXV ratio](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%3AVXV) has just triggered its first sell signal (for the SPX/SPY) since late August as a result of the VIX falling to the current level of 44.60.

Note that even though the holiday season typically has lower than normal volatility, I do not recalibrate the ratio or the signals to account for seasonal tendencies.
