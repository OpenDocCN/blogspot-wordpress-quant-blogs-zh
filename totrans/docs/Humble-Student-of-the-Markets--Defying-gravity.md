[Peering into 2020 and beyond](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2019/02/17/peering-into-2020-and-beyond/)

). So far, the pullback has yet to materialize, though risk levels continue to rise as the SPX approaches its resistance zone at 2800-2810.

**A Special Announcement**

We told you so. We told you the market was going down.

Here is the track of

***Humble Student of the Markets***

, where we are neither perma-bulls nor perma-bears. Most recently, we have been correctly bullish since the correction of 2015, and turned cautious in August 2018 (see

 February 24, 2009).
