> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2020/02/the-esg-challenges-to-energy-investing.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2020/02/the-esg-challenges-to-energy-investing.html#0001-01-01)

I received a ton of comments from my post three weeks ago on the energy sector (see

[Energy: Value opportunity, or value trap?](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2020/01/18/energy-value-opportunity-or-value-trap/)

). I engaged in multiple long email discussions with several readers on different aspects of that post. This is a follow-up to the publication address two main issues that were raised:

*   The impact of the solar cycle hypothesis on the Earth's climate, and as a bullish catalyst for the energy sector
*   How to investing in energy stocks in the new ESG era.
