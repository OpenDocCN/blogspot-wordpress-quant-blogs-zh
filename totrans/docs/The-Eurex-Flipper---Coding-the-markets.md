## The Eurex Flipper

### November 18, 2008

Good write up on Paul Rotter – the Eurex Flipper – [here](http://www.tcamarkets.com/pdfs/TMPaulRotter.pdf). It gives me hope to think that one expert human trader can repeatedly find and exploit inefficiencies in such a fast moving liquid order driven market as Eurex.

[This paper](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/papers/optexec.pdf) is a very accessible treatment of finding the optimal price point for limit order submission.
