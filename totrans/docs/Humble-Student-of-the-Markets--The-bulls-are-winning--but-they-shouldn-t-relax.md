# Humble Student of the Markets: The bulls are winning, but they shouldn't relax

**Mid-week market update:**

On the weekend, I wrote that the stock market was experiencing a bullish breadth thrust and the market is likely to see a series of "good"overbought readings where stock prices either continue to grind up or consolidate sideways as they get overbought (see

[RIP Correction. Reflationary resurrection next?](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/03/06/rip-correction-reflationary-resurrection-next/)

). So far, so good. The market seems to be behaving according to the script I laid out so far.

As the hourly chart of the SPX shows. The market weakness on Monday and Tuesday were relatively minor. The index saw a minor positive RSI divergence and the 50 hour moving average has so far acted as support.

As well, this chart from

[IndexIndicators](http://www.indexindicators.com/indicators/breadth/)

show that the net 20-day highs-lows, which has been a good intermediate term (1-2 week) trading indicator, seems to have found support at a high level. If this continues, it would lend support to the "good"overbought bull case.

While I remain optimistic about the technical underpinnings of the bullish scenario, that`s only half the story.
