# Humble Student of the Markets: Dr. Copper teeters over the abyss

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2010/07/dr-copper-teeters-over-abyss.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2010/07/dr-copper-teeters-over-abyss.html#0001-01-01)

The market action last week was dominated by concerns of a double-dip. Indeed, the week began with

[John Hussman warning of a double-dip recession](http://www.hussmanfunds.com/wmc/wmc100628.htm)

 and ended with John Mauldin's

[hand wringing over the NFP release](http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2010/07/the-dismal-science-really-is/)

.

Dr. Copper, one of the most economically sensitive of commodities, is curiously showing weakness but hasn’t fallen apart. This is an indication to me that it may be a little early to over-react to recessionary fears.

By contrast, the SPX has shown a greater degree of weakness than copper. While the red metal is in a downtrend, it hasn’t even tested major support levels. By comparison, equities sliced through support like a hot knife through butter.

In fact, the entire commodity complex is showing the same pattern as copper – weakness but no freefall.

**Apocalypse not yet**

Does that mean all is well?

Not quite. Take a look at the copper to SPX ratio. While the ratio is indicating a near-term positive relative performance by copper, the ratio is displaying a rounding inverted saucer top pattern which is indicative of a long term decline.

These conditions are consistent with the readings of my

[Inflation-Deflation Timer model](http://www.qwestfunds.com/publications/newsletters_pdf/newsletter_november_2009.pdf)

, which remains in neutral but perched at the edge of a deflation reading, which would be indicative of a

[2008-style panic](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2010/06/are-markets-setting-up-for-repeat-of.html)

. The Inflation-Deflation Timer model is a trend following model, which can be late in calling economic trends.

These conditions are also consistent with John Hussman’s earlier

[essay](http://www.hussmanfunds.com/wmc/wmc100614.htm)

outlining the tripwires of a double-dip recession. The only sign that remained to call for a full blown double-dip recession was the

[ISM Index](http://www.ism.ws/ismreport/mfgrob.cfm)

at or below 54\. The latest release of the index came in at 56.2, declining fast but not quite at 54 yet.

[Hussman did note](http://www.hussmanfunds.com/wmc/wmc100628.htm)

, however, that the ECRI Weekly Leading Indicator, which has been in freefall, is highly correlated with ISM with a lead time of 13 weeks - and that's why he made the double-dip recession call.

Overall, I am tilting towards the views of 

[Barry Ritholz](http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2010/07/slowing-growth-or-recession/)

, who wrote that "We do not rule out a double dip or a recession in 2012 —

***we simply do not have sufficient evidence to draw that conclusion***

."

Right now, my inner investor is extremely cautious and defensive in light of the risks of a hard landing. On the other hand, my inner trader tells me that a waterfall decline is not an immediate threat, but to be prepared for a short and sharp relief rally to lighten long positions and/or to initiate short positions.
