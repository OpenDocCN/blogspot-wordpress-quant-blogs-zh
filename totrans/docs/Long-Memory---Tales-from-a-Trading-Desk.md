## Long Memory

Interesting [read](https://eric.exeter.ac.uk/repository/bitstream/handle/10036/3686/RambaccussingD.pdf) if you have the time.

> Long memory may be defined in the time or frequency domain. In the time domain, it simply means that the sum of the correlations over time is nonfinite. In the frequency domain, a process is said to exhibit long memory if the spectral density function is unbounded at low frequencies.
