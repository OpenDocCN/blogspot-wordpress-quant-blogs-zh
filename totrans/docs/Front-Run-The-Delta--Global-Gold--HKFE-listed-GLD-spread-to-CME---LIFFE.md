> 来源：[https://frontrunthedelta.blogspot.com/2011/08/global-gold-hkfe-listed-gld-spread-to.html#0001-01-01](https://frontrunthedelta.blogspot.com/2011/08/global-gold-hkfe-listed-gld-spread-to.html#0001-01-01)

This is the arbitrage constructed from four gold futures contracts, all denominated in USD.  The four contracts include: CME's

 and

 contracts, and the

contract (not to be confused with the

of the same symbol).

The similarities of these contracts make this structure a relatively simple one, however if the many contracts listed in other currencies, with different quality

[grades](http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/207276/fineness)

 and weights of varying sizes are included, the complexity of arbitrage grows exponentially. 

The bid/asks of the four contracts were recorded from 7:00PM CST July 25, 2011 to 3:05PM CST on July 26, 2011.

 This is the overlapping hours where all four contracts are open for electronic trading.
