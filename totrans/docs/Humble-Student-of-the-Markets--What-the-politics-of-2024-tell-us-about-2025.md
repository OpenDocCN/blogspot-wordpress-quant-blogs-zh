# Humble Student of the Markets: What the politics of 2024 tell us about 2025

I am not fond of the ritual of “year ahead” forecasts. Street strategists’ forecasts are far more dispersed compared to past years. The 2024 year-end target for the S&P 500 varies from 4200 to 5200.

So let’s make this brief. Analysis from

of Carson Group shows that the S&P 500 rises an average of 12.2% in an election under a new president. That sounds about right in light of the recent Zweig Breadth Thrust buy signal from early November.

Instead, I would like to offer a different kind of “year ahead” analysis. What does the political and economic landscape of 2024 mean for investors in 2025?
