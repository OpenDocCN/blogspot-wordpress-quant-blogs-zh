# Humble Student of the Markets: FOMC preview: Dot plot, YCC, and SLR

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2021/03/fomc-preview-dot-plot-ycc-and-slr.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2021/03/fomc-preview-dot-plot-ycc-and-slr.html#0001-01-01)

As the markets remain in risk-on mode, readers should be aware of several lurking risks that may appear from the FOMC meeting. Undoubtedly, Powell will repeat his dovish mantra that the Fed is a long way from neutral and policymakers are focused on the labor market. 

Nevertheless, here is what I am watching:

*   What will the "dot plot" convey about the path of interest rates and how does that differ from market expectations?
*   Will the Fed do anything about the soaring 10-year yield, which has risen above 1.6%, i.e. yield curve control (YCC)?
*   What will happen to the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR), and will the banks get SLR relief after March 31?
