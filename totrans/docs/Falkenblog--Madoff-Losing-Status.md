As the New York Times only prints news fit to print, I feel obligated to keep inquiring financial minds informed on all dimensions of the financial crisis.

It's been documented that subordinates

at their bosses jokes than vice versa. Such is the nature of interaction in a hierarchical society with a strong pretense for egalitarianism. Rich people have more friends, bigger birthday parties, etc. But once you lose everything, you suddenly aren't as funny, as friendworthy, as desirable.

Bernie Madoff's ex-mistress, clearly not above seeking financial gains where others don't, wrote a quickie book

> Bernie had a very small penis. Not only was it on the short side, it was small in circumference. That he was now pointing it out to me was telling. It clearly caused him great angst. I wanted to be careful how I responded. Men and their penises have a strange and unique relationship...[However] I liked this man and didn’t want to emasculate him. His tiny penis hadn’t prevented me from climaxing...On the bright side, oral sex would be a breeze.

In his position this isn't very damaging to his status. I can't think it helps her socially, but I imagine without that passage, there would absolutely nothing noteworthy in there.
