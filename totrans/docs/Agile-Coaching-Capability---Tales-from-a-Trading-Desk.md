# Agile Coaching Capability | Tales from a Trading Desk

> 来源：[https://mdavey.wordpress.com/2015/11/14/agile-coaching-capability/#0001-01-01](https://mdavey.wordpress.com/2015/11/14/agile-coaching-capability/#0001-01-01)

Yesterday, during the last day of [Construx](http://www.construx.com/Thought_Leadership/Events/Software_Executive_Summit/?id=16269) Software Executive Summit 2015,  Lyssa [Adkins](http://www.coachingagileteams.com/) presented, Developing Your Staff’s Agile Coaching Ability.  The talk validated my view that Agile Coaches are key to the uptake of [agile](http://www.agilecoachinginstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/whitePaper-ACI-The-Agile-Leader-Jan-2015.pdf).  Many organisation believe they can send staff on 2 day Scrum course, get the certification, and immediately see the benefits.  This mindset is utterly wrong.  The change from Command-Control to an embracement of agile values doesn’t happen overnight.  Agile coaches are key to aiding team to move into the new world.  I’ve not read Lyssa’s book, [Coaching Agile Teams: A Companion for ScrumMasters, Agile Coaches, and Project Managers in Transition](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Coaching-Agile-Teams-ScrumMasters-Addison-Wesley-ebook/dp/B003QP47YG/ref=dp_kinw_strp_1), but will do shortly as I’m expecting it to be good based on the talk yesterday.

Lyssa’s “Developing an Internal Agile [Coaching](http://www.agilecoachinginstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Developing-an-Internal-Agile-Coaching-Capability.pdf) Capability” offer an interesting read:

> organizations need solid Agile Coaches to help establish the deep, institutional capability required to become a truly agile organization. Team agility is a first step, but ultimately withers without organizational agility. Organizational agility requires an agile coaching capability to establish self-organized teams (a new organization innovation), as well as a new form of agile leadership amongst management, and a re-thinking of organizational structures, policies and culture.

One of the key points in the above extract from Lyssa’s paper is “re-thinking of organizational structures”.  In my view, many organizations attempt to be agile at the team/project level, but the organizational structures around them remain in the old world (managers, leaders, C-Level’s, HR, etc) which effectively become impediments in the organisation adoption of agile.

This leads nice to agile [leaders](http://www.agilecoachinginstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/whitePaper-ACI-The-Agile-Leader-Jan-2015.pdf), and the need for such individual who have:

> the chief responsibility is to increase flow, minimize waste, and see (and help others see) the larger system.

A lack of agile leaders and coaches will constrain the ability to embrace agile.  Without C-Level embracements of agile leadership, organizations will suffer challenges on the road to embracing agile.  [Managers](http://cmforagile.blogspot.nl/2014/07/the-role-of-middle-management-in-agile.html) and leaders need to [re-think](https://www.scrumalliance.org/community/articles/2008/july/the-manager-s-role-in-agile) their roles and responsibilities in an agile world.
