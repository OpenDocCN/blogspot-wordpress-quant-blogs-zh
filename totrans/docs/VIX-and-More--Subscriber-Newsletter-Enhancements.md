# VIX and More: Subscriber Newsletter Enhancements

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/11/subscriber-newsletter-enhancements.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/11/subscriber-newsletter-enhancements.html#0001-01-01)

Just a quick note to let those who are interested know that the [subscriber newsletter](http://vixandmoresubscriber.blogspot.com/) has received considerable reader feedback and made a number of changes in October. Perhaps the biggest change is to expand the scope of the newsletter (which already had a broader reach than this blog) to focus more on macroeconomic and fundamental issues, provide a stronger global perspective, and make an effort to highlight more high potential stocks and ETFs.

A [subscriber newsletter blog](http://vixandmoresubscriber.blogspot.com/) recaps the newsletter content each month and provides updates on several model portfolios the newsletter tracks, including a Stock of the Week selection that has a cumulative gain of 90% since the newsletter was launched on March 30, 2008.

If anyone has any questions about the subscriber newsletter, or is interested in reviewing a sample, please feel free to email me at [bill.luby@gmail.com](mailto:bill.luby@gmail.com)
