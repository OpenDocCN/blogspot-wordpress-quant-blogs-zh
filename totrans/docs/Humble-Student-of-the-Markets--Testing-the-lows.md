) in which I called a recession received a lot of attention. As recessions tend to be bull market killers, the challenge for investors and traders is to manage their investments during a recessionary bear market.

In the short run, the SPX is testing the lows set on Monday, while constructively flashing positive RSI divergences. As well, the VIX Index recycled below its upper Bollinger Band Tuesday, which is a tactical buy signal, and it stayed there today despite the support test.
