# Quantifiable Edges: A Historical Look At The 1st Trading Day In May

I’ve discussed many times before how the 1st trading day of the month tends to be seasonally bullish. May has been one of the strongest months, both based on total return and % profitable.

[In 2010 I published a chart](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2010/05/first-trading-day-of-may-has-been.html)

that showed May 1 returns over time.  I’ve updated that chart below and included some stats.

Even with last year being a slight loss the 1

^(st)

day of May has demonstrated a seasonally bullish tendency over the years.
