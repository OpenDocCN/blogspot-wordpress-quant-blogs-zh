By popular demand, here is the latest list of

[Phoenix](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2008/05/waiting-for-ride-on-phoenix.html)

candidates:

There are 39 stocks on the list, compared to 58 stocks in the

[last update on March 11](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2009/03/phoenix-strategy-update.html)

. As a reminder, the Phoenix stock list consists stocks that pass the following criteria:

*   Stock price between $1 and $5 (low-priced stocks)
*   Down at least 80% from a year ago (beaten up)
*   Market cap of $100 million or more (were once "real" companies)
*   Net insider buying in the last six months (some downside protection from insider activity)

Of the 39 stocks on the list, 18 stocks, or 46%, show a bottoming technical pattern, an [indicator](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2009/03/how-to-spot-bottom.html) that I watch for as a measure of overall market's technical condition. Genworth Financial (GNW), which is showing a double bottom, is a good example:

The portion showing the bottoming pattern is largely unchanged from my

[last update](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2009/03/how-to-spot-bottom.html)

, which had 43% of the list showing this pattern.

**Still too early to buy Phoenix** 

Given these readings and the fact that the major market averages appear to be

[overbought](http://bespokeinvest.typepad.com/bespoke/2009/04/sp-500-near-overbought-levels.html)

, my best guess is that we are witnessing a bear market rally that is on its last legs. I would be very cautious about committing funds to a Phoenix strategy in the short term.
