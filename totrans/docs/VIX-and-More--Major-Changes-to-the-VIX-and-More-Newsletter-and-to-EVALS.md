# VIX and More: Major Changes to the VIX and More Newsletter and to EVALS

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2011/12/changes-to-vix-and-more-newsletter-and.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2011/12/changes-to-vix-and-more-newsletter-and.html#0001-01-01)

Just a quick update to let readers know that there have been some substantial changes recently to the [VIX and More subscriber newsletter](http://vixandmoresubscriber.blogspot.com/) and to [VIX and More: EVALS](http://vixandmoreevals.blogspot.com/).

Back in July I moved the publication of the VIX and More newsletter from Sundays to Wednesdays, due to subscriber feedback. At the time I also dramatically changed the focus of the newsletter content, again based on subscriber feedback, placing an increased emphasis on the analysis of [VIX ETPs](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20ETN) and ideas about how to trade them.

Two weeks ago I also completely overhauled [EVALS](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EVALS) so that it now focuses almost exclusively as a model portfolio for VIX ETPs.

Rather than go into the details of these changes in this space, those who are interested in more information are encouraged to check out:

A large part of the reason for these changes is to link the newsletter and EVALS more tightly and also have EVALS complement and extend the analysis found in the newsletter.

Thanks to all those who have provided feedback along the way to enhance the value of these two services.
