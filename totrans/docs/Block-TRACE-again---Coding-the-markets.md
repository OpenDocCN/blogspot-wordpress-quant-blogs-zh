## Block TRACE again

### September 29, 2006

So I checked out the [TRACE](http://www.nasdbondinfo.com/asp/bond_search.asp) website the other evening, after following up [Accrued](http://accruedint.blogspot.com/)‘s [post](http://accruedint.blogspot.com/2006/09/bond-traders-lose-1-billion.html). There are different rules for reporting blocks, obviously designed to protect dealers offering block liquidity.
