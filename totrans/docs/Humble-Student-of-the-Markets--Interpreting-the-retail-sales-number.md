# Humble Student of the Markets: Interpreting the retail sales number

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2012/02/interpreting-retail-sales-number.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2012/02/interpreting-retail-sales-number.html#0001-01-01)

The retail sales number reported today came in mixed. The headline number came in below expectations, but the ex-auto number was strong. There were revisions everywhere.

What to make of this?

I believe that the American consumer it's would be a mistake to think that the American consumer as down and out. The

[Consumer Metrics Institute](http://www.consumerindexes.com/index.html)

produces a series of figures that tracks American consumer activity on a daily basis. The daily series shows a modest uptick.

Daily numbers are inherently noisy, but the monthly figures show a definite rebound in consumer demand.

For the final word, Nomura (via

[Business Insider](http://www.businessinsider.com/this-is-the-1-sign-that-consumer-are-really-starting-to-feel-good-2012-2)

) interpreted the retail sales report positively:

> The control measure feeds into estimates for the consumer spending component of GDP and suggests a healthy round of spending to start the year. Lastly, ***our preferred measure of consumer comfort, the category of dining out, increased by a strong 0.6% in January. Dining out can be seen as one of the ultra-discretionary categories of spending that is typically the first place households will cut back on spending if confidence is faltering***.

Remember that we are in a central bank induced liquidity rally. Last week the BoE joined the party, this week it was the BoJ. Enjoy.
