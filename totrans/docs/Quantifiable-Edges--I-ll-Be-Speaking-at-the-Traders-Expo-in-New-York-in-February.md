The Traders Expo will be held at the Marriot Marquis Hotel in from February 20 - 23, 2011.  I've decided to make the trip. 

I'll be speaking on the 21st from 1:30 - 2:30pm.  I'll be discussing some of of my favorite research and trading ideas.  I hope to have the opportunity to meet severall blog readers and subscribers at the event.

I'll send out another reminder as we get closer.  Registration is free and you may sign up using the link below:
