**Trend Model signal summary**

Trend Model signal: Risk-off

Trading model: Bullish (upgrade)

The Trend Model is an asset allocation model which applies trend following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. In essence, it seeks to answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or contraction (bearish)?"

My inner trader uses the trading model component of the Trend Model seeks to answer the question, "Is the trend getting better (bullish) or worse (bearish)?" The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below.

**Update schedule**

**How worried should you be?**

Well, the stock market certain took a fright last week! At this point, we have to ask ourselves the question of how worried should we be about the market outlook.

For investors, the answer to that question depends on your time horizon. Do you need the money next month, next quarter or next year? If you need the money in such a short period, then did your asset allocation reflect those circumstances? I would contend that as your anxiety level should be falling as your time horizon lengthens.

In this week`s review, I will cover the following topics, starting from long term framework to a shorter one:

*   What is the downside tail-risk for stock prices?
*   What's the upside potential?
*   What does the near-term risk-reward environment for stock prices?
