# Humble Student of the Markets: Don't fight the Fed (or the macro trend)

As the 10-year Treasury yield flirts with the 4% level and the yield curve steepens from its inverted condition, it’s worthwhile to keep in mind that the universe is unfolding as it should. Monetary conditions are tight, inflation is moderating, the jobs market, though tight, is weakening, and the economy is chugging along with no signs of a recession. Various Fed speakers have cautioned that while the inflation fight isn’t finished, the hiking cycle is over and the next likely interest rate move is down.

These conditions argue for a bull steepening of the yield curve, where bond yields fall while the curve steepens, and a conducive environment for stock prices. Why fight the Fed and the macro trend?
