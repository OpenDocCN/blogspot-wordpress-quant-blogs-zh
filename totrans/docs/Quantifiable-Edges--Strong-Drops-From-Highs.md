# Quantifiable Edges: Strong Drops From Highs

When strong moves down occur from high levels as happened on Friday, there is often a bit more downside follow through. Below is a study that exemplifies this.

Certainly not an overwhelming edge, but a hint that there could be more selling before a bounce occurs.

BTW, watch out this week for a few exciting announcements from Quantifiable Edges!
