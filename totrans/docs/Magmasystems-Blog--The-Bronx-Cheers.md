# Magmasystems Blog: The Bronx Cheers

> 来源：[http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2006/08/bronx-cheers.html#0001-01-01](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2006/08/bronx-cheers.html#0001-01-01)

Random Seinfeld-ish Thought...

Why are Americans suddenly using the signatory line of "Cheers"? People I know who were born and raised in Brooklyn are suddenly signing email message with "Cheers".

The next time you say "Cheers" to me, you had better have a scotch in your hand!
