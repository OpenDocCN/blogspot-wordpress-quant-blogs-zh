# Timely Portfolio: Yen and JGBs Short-Term vs Long Term

> 来源：[http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2013/02/yen-and-jgbs-short-term-vs-long-term.html#0001-01-01](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2013/02/yen-and-jgbs-short-term-vs-long-term.html#0001-01-01)

I have read some articles arguing that the recent move in the Japanese Yen is overdone.  However, considering the short-term without regard to the long-term context is naïve and potentially dangerous.  Although I do not have significant proof, I believe long-term mean reversion can completely dominate short-term mean reversion hopes.  Just to provide some longer-term context, I thought I would offer some graphical aids.

In my mind, the Yen selloff is only in its infancy.  For the move to truly engage, I think we need Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yields to move higher also, and if it does we are in a different paradigm than the last 20 years.  But, what do I know?
