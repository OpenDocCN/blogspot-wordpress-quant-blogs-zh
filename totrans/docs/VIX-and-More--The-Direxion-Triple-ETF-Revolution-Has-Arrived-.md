# VIX and More: The Direxion Triple ETF Revolution Has Arrived!

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/12/direxion-triple-etf-revolution-has.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/12/direxion-triple-etf-revolution-has.html#0001-01-01)

Three weeks ago last Friday I thought I may be sticking my head out a little too far in [Prediction: Direxion Triple ETFs Will Revolutionize Day Trading](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/11/prediction-direxion-triple-etfs-will.html). Well, here we are barely three weeks later and these [triple ETFs](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/triple%20ETFs) are racking up more volume in the first half hour of today’s session than they did in an entire trading day when I made my original prediction. (see graphic below)

In short, the revolution has already arrived.

Sure, there have been some issues with tracking error as Adam at [Daily Options](http://adamsoptions.blogspot.com/) pointed out in [Triple the Fun](http://adamsoptions.blogspot.com/2008/12/triple-fun.html). On an intra-day basis, however, these ETFs seem to track and trend relatively accurately. And if you get the direction right, are you really going to be upset that you were right a factor of say only 2.7 times the underlying instead of an advertised multiplier of 3.0? Either way, it was still probably a wise allocation of capital.

The next frontier may turn out to be options strategies associated with these 3x and -3x ETFs. All eight of these ETFs are optionable and options activity seems to be picking up rapidly, particularly in [BGU](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/BGU), the large cap 3x bull ETF, which currently sports an implied volatility of about 150 and a historical volatility in excess of 200.
