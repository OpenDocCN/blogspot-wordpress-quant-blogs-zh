# Humble Student of the Markets: China: Global bullish catalyst?

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2023/03/china-global-bullish-catalyst.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2023/03/china-global-bullish-catalyst.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models** 

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post, 

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The 

**Trend Asset Allocation Model**

 is an asset allocation model that applies trend-following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity prices. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. The performance and full details of a model portfolio based on the out-of-sample signals of the Trend Model can be found

[here](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/trend-model-report-card/)

.

My inner trader uses a 

**trading model**

, which is a blend of price momentum (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa). Subscribers receive real-time alerts of model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of the email alerts is updated weekly 

[here](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/trading-track-record/)

. The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that began in March 2016 is shown below.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Buy equities*
*   Trend Model signal: Bullish*
*   Trading model: Neutral*

** The performance chart and model readings have been delayed by a week out of respect to our paying subscribers.***Update schedule**

: I generally update model readings on my 

[site](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/)

 on weekends. I am also on Twitter at @humblestudent and on Mastodon at @humblestudent@toot.community. Subscribers receive real-time alerts of trading model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of those email alerts is shown

**America the weak?** 

This chart of the Euro STOXX 50, MSCI China, and S&P 500 (all in USD) tells a story of differing relative strength. The Euro STOXX 50 has been flat since early February the best relative performer. MSCI China has been correcting, but turned up last week when Hong Kong announced that it was eliminating its COVID mask mandate. In addition, China's PMI data came in better than expected, indicating expansion. The S&P 500 topped out mid-February and its bottom lagged both Europe and China.

Let's briefly review the performance and backdrop of each region.
