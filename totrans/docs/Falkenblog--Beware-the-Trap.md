# Falkenblog: Beware the Trap

> 来源：[http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2008/06/life-is-unfair.html#0001-01-01](http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2008/06/life-is-unfair.html#0001-01-01)

From Clive James's

[Cultural Amnesia](http://www.amazon.com/Cultural-Amnesia-Necessary-Memories-History/dp/0393061167)

:

> 'Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend'
> --Mao Zedong.
> 
> For the trick to work, millions of people had to believe the words meant what they said, even though the Party, within long memory, had never rewarded a contentious voice with anything except torture and death. Anyway, the suckers fell for it. The flowers bloomed, the schools of thought contended, and Mao's executioners went to work. The slogan had the same function as the Constitution of the Soviet Union, which Alexsandr Zinoviev telling defined as a document published in order to find out who agreed with it, so that they could be dealt with.
