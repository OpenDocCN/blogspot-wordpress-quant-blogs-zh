> 来源：[http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2014/02/more-on-rebalancing-with-data-from.html#0001-01-01](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2014/02/more-on-rebalancing-with-data-from.html#0001-01-01)

While on the topic of rebalancing (see [Unsolved Mysteries of Rebalancing](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2014/02/unsolved-mysteries-of-rebalancing.html)), I thought it would be good to highlight another good research paper with some quick rCharts analysis.

> Arnott, Robert D., et al.
> **The Surprising Alpha from Malkiel’s Monkey and Upside-Down Strategies**
> The Journal of Portfolio Management 39.4 (2013): 91-105.
