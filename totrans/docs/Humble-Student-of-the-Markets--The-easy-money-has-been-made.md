# Humble Student of the Markets: The easy money has been made

**Mid-week market update:** I know that this is a trite expression, but the easy money has been made. The rally off the October bottom has been astounding. My trading model was fortunate enough to spot the exact day of the bottom when insiders started buying an oversold market. The rally enjoyed further tailwinds in the form of a rare Zweig Breadth Thrust buy signal. The trading model took a brief hiatus in November and re-entered on the long side. It took profits when the S&P 500 violated its 10 dma.

The rally off the October bottom was driven by falling Treasury yields, which also violated its 10 dma. While my inner investor remains equity bullish, my inner trader is far more cautious.
