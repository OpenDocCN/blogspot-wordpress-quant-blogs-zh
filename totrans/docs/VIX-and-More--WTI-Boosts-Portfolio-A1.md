# VIX and More: WTI Boosts Portfolio A1

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/02/wti-boosts-portfolio-a1.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/02/wti-boosts-portfolio-a1.html#0001-01-01)

After a challenging start to the new year that resulted in a major reshuffling of the portfolio, it looks as if Portfolio A1 is now back on track with an interesting cross-section of holdings.  Part of the credit for the performance turnaround should go to [W&T Offshore (WTI)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=wti), the oil and gas exploration and production company that gained 9.2% in the first week it was in the portfolio.  A five stock portfolio is always a crap shoot of sorts, but given the current market environment and opportunities it presents, I am pleased with the current makeup of the portfolio.

After 51 weeks (since the February 16, 2007 inception), Portfolio A1 sports a cumulative performance of +4.8% vs. a -8.5% performance in the benchmark S&P 500 index over the same period.

Gone after just one week in the portfolio is [Chattem (CHTT)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=chtt), which is being replaced by [Invitrogen (IVGN)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=ivgn), a lab testing and diagnostic company that just last week [reported solid earnings and resolved some patent disputes](http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/080206/earns_invitrogen.html?.v=1).  For those looking for more information on IVGN, a good place to start is with the [conference call transcript](http://seekingalpha.com/article/63272-invitrogen-corp-q4-2007-earnings-call-transcript?source=yahoo) from the February 5, 2008 conference call.

There no additional changes to the portfolio this week.

A snapshot of Portfolio A1 is as follows:
