# Humble Student of the Markets: *Sigh* Another growth scare!

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2016/05/sigh-another-growth-scare.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2016/05/sigh-another-growth-scare.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models**

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on research outlined in our post

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The

**Trend Model**

is an asset allocation model which applies trend following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or contraction (bearish)?"

My inner trader uses the

**trading component**

of the Trend Model seeks to answer the question, "Is the trend getting better (bullish) or worse (bearish)?" The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. Past trading of this model has shown turnover rates of about 200% per month.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Buy equities*
*   Trend Model signal: Risk-on*
*   Trading model: Bullish*

**Price vs. fundamental momentum**

The stock market got another growth scare last week when it weakened last Tuesday, after a dismal set of PMI reports, and ended with a Non-Farm Payroll miss in the US Employment report. I was reminded of an article by Kurt Feuerman and James Tierney Jr. of AllianceBernstein entitled

[Don`t Confuse Price with Business Momentum](http://www.institutionalinvestor.com/gmtl/3551450/dont-confuse-price-with-business-momentum.html)

:

> Momentum is a funny thing. Share price momentum isn`t necessarily an indicator of business momentum. Sometimes a stock is falling simply because investors are taking profits after its outperformance or because a portfolio is changing its risk profile in a volatile market. There are countless reasons why share prices move.
> 
> Last year's narrow market is a case in point. Investors might assume that the underperformance of a large swath of the U.S. stock market means that most companies are in bad shape. There is, however, another plausible interpretation: It could also mean that there are a lot of buying opportunities in undervalued companies, ones that have a much better business than is widely believed.

In other words, don`t confuse price momentum with fundamental momentum. So what's the trend in macro and fundamental momentum?

Oh PUH-LEEZ! How real does the latest growth scare look to you?
