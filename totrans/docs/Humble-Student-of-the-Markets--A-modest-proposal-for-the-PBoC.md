[FT Alphaville](http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2016/01/08/2149571/how-petrostates-may-solve-their-fiscal-woes/)

reports that Charlene Chu of Autonomous Research has suggested that China needs as much as USD 5 trillion in credit injections in order to have a similar effect as the shock-and-awe campaign of 2009\. If Beijing were pursue that course of action, I have a modest proposal for the PBoC.
