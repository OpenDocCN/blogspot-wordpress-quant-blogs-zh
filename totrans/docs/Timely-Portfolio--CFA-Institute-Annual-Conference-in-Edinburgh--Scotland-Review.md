# Timely Portfolio: CFA Institute Annual Conference in Edinburgh, Scotland Review

> 来源：[http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2011/05/cfa-institute-annual-conference-in_16.html#0001-01-01](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2011/05/cfa-institute-annual-conference-in_16.html#0001-01-01)

I thoroughly enjoyed my first [CFA Institute Annual Conference](http://annual.cfaconference.org/) in [Edinburgh, Scotland, a wonderful city rich in history, architecture, whiskey, and beautiful landscapes](http://flickriver.com/groups/edinburgh/pool/interesting/).  I cannot imagine seeing such a broad range of world-class speakers and financial minds anywhere else in such a short period of time.  I hope to be able to incorporate in future blog posts some of the ideas expressed in the sessions I personally attended (pics and biography all from the [CFA Institute Annual Conference](http://annual.cfaconference.org/) site).

My personal favorites were Sanusi Lamido Sanusi (for those of you who have not heard of him, please take the time to [look him up](http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/ee3087da-ca96-11df-a860-00144feab49a.html) for his remarkable courage and common sense central banking), Russell Napier, ASIP, and Raghuram G. Rajan.
