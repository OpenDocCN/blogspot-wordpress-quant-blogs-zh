# VIX and More: VWSI Still Holding at -9

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/08/vwsi-still-holding-at.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/08/vwsi-still-holding-at.html#0001-01-01)

In the 17 ½ years of VIX data, the VWSI has never managed register extreme negative reading two weeks in a row…until now.  With the VIX spiking to 24.15 on Friday, down 0.02 for the week, the VWSI managed to end the week at -9, just one tick higher than the maximum [-10 reading of a week ago](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/07/vix-spikes-to-2417-vwsi-at-10.html).  The old record for two consecutive weeks was a rather paltry sounding -6 and -8, which spanned the weeks ending [August 28](http://timelines.ws/20thcent/1998_08.HTML) and [September 4, 1998](http://timelines.ws/20thcent/1998_09.HTML), at the height of the [Russian financial crisis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_financial_crisis).

So while a week ago I spelled out the [historical context](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/07/vix-spikes-to-2417-vwsi-at-10.html) that argued forcefully for a mean reverting VIX drop this past week, clearly this week’s sideways movement represented another unprecedented turn of events for the VIX. In spite of this, I *still* anticipate that the VIX will shed some 15-20% in the coming week.  If the VIX goes up again this week, then it is time to tweak the VWSI model and/or accept the fact that we are in uncharted volatility waters.

To put things in perspective from a VWSI standpoint, if the VIX holds steady this week, we will probably end the week with a VWSI of about -2.  On the other hand, if the VWSI is to remain in the -9 to -10 range for a third consecutive week, it will take a VIX of at least the high 20s to pull that rabbit out of the hat.

 *(Note that in the above temperature gauge, the "bullish" and "bearish" labels apply to the VIX, not to the broader markets, which are usually negatively correlated with the VIX.)*

 *****Wine pairing:***  After two weeks of heightened volatility, I would be hard pressed to find fault with someone who is still drinking some of the ports from last week.  A VWSI of -9, however, calls for a change of pace.  What better change of pace then to turn to a varietal that was almost completely wiped out, only to stage a recent comeback over a century later on another continent.  I am talking about [carmenere](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmen%C3%A8re), a grape whose rediscovery and revival in <country-region st="on"><place st="on">Chile</place></country-region> is one of the [great stories](http://www.beveragebusiness.com/bbcontent/art-arch/block1002.html) of the wine world.  I was lucky enough to have an exceptional [Concha y Toro 2003 Terrunyo Carmenere](http://www.banfivintners.com/BANFI/REVIEWS/REV_CTTE.HTM#2003) last year and it was one of the tasting highlights of the year.  If you are looking for additional suggestions, see which other carmeneres have been getting rave reviews on [Cellar Tracker](http://www.cellartracker.com/list.asp?O=CScoreSort+DESC&Table=List&amp;amp;amp;amp;Varietal=Carmen%E8re&Page=0).**
