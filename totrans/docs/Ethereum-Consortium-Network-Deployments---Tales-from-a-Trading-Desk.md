## Ethereum Consortium Network Deployments

Reading “Ethereum Consortium Network [Deployments](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/ethereum-consortium-blockchain-network) Made Easy” just goes to highlight Microsoft’s blockchain game plan.  Some people will have an issue with the fact that its leveraging Microsoft Azure.   I’ve not run the template myself, but if the readme is close to reality, then Microsoft have made it incredible easy to get into the blockchain game for companies, and start developing smart contracts.
