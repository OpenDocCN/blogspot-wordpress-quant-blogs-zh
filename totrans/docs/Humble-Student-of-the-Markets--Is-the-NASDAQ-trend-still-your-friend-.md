**Mid-week market update**

: There have been a number of questions of whether the NASDAQ run is over.

reported that Jim Paulsen of Leuthold Group highlighted the vulnerable nature of technology stocks. Paulsen pointed to the Tech/Utilities ratio as a way of showing that Tech is nearly as stretch as it was during the height of the NASDAQ bubble.

 also worried about the recent NASDAQ breakout, which was not followed by the major large cap averages, as well as a negative RSI divergence.

In addition, Kimble highlighted the huge weekly inflow into the NASDAQ 100 ETF (NDX), which could be interpreted as contrarian bearish.
