# Quantifiable Edges: Strong Breadth & a Down SPX

> 来源：[http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2012/02/strong-breadth-down-spx.html#0001-01-01](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2012/02/strong-breadth-down-spx.html#0001-01-01)

When breadth posts solid numbers and the SPX declines (during an uptrend) that has often been followed by a rebound in the next few days. The study below triggered at Tuesday’s close. It is one I have shown several times in the Subscriber Letter.

The edge isn’t huge, but it does appear to be fairly reliable. Much of the edge is realized within the 1st 2 days.
