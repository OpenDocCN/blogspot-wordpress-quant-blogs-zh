# Scrum of Scrum – Smells | Tales from a Trading Desk

> 来源：[https://mdavey.wordpress.com/2013/10/04/scrum-of-scrum-smells/#0001-01-01](https://mdavey.wordpress.com/2013/10/04/scrum-of-scrum-smells/#0001-01-01)

## Scrum of Scrum – Smells

A re-phrasing of

[questions](http://www.scrumalliance.org/community/articles/2007/may/advice-on-conducting-the-scrum-of-scrums-meeting)

from the usual scrum questions:

1.  What has your team done since we last met?
2.  What will your team do before we meet again?
3.  Is anything slowing your team down or getting in their way?
4.  Are you about to put something in another team’s way?

Be concious of what people need out of the

[scrum](http://guide.agilealliance.org/guide/scrumofscrums.html)

between team, and what you want to get.

Don’t call a Scum of Scum a Scrum of Ccrum when its not a Scrum of Scrum!
