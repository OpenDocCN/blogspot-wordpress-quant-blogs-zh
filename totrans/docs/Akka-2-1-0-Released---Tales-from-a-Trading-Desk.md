# Akka 2.1.0 Released | Tales from a Trading Desk

## Akka 2.1.0 Released

Details [here](http://blog.typesafe.com/akka-210-released) and [here](http://letitcrash.com/post/38544819129/akka-2-1-0-released).  Key from my perspective is “cluster support (experimental, including [cluster](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/snapshot/cluster/cluster-usage-java.html) membership logic & death watch and cluster-aware routers, see more below)”.  The downside is the “experimental” tag that will continue until Akka 2.2 ‘[Coltrane](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18W9-fKs55wiFNjXL9q50PYOnR7-nnsImzJqHOPPbM4E/edit?hl=en_US)’
