# State of Scrum | Tales from a Trading Desk

## State of Scrum

Scrum Alliance has an interesting [report](http://www.scrumalliance.org/why-scrum/state-of-scrum-report) on the State of Scrum – 500 professionals in over 70 countries were surveyed for the report.  Of interest:

*   Culture is key – corporations must aid an agile culture encouraging collaboration
*   Scrum rules from an agile approach, followed by Kanban – no surprise
*   Q12 and the PMO says a lot
*   Certification, Q13, is curious.  I’d be interested in how many have actually read a scrum book prior to certification 😉
*   Distributed teams, Q24, 24%
*   Daily stand-ups, Q29 only 59%???  I wonder how many of those daily stand-ups are actually well run?
*   Retrospectives, Q30, 62% – probably the same people who hold daily stand-ups.  40% need to leave the building fast
*   Q31 – CI.  To me this just confirms that the software engineering community is still so lost in the wilderness on basic engineering principles or building software 😦
