## BUILD: Thoughts and Notes ‚Äì XAML/HTML with C++/JavaScript¬†(WinRT)

Whilst I [download](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/br229516)/install the [Windows](http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2011/06/windows-8-for-software-developers-the-longhorn-dream-reborn.ars/2) 8 Developer Preview I offer a few [BUILD](http://www.buildwindows.com/) thoughts/notes:

*   C++ is the ‚Äúnew‚Äù language ‚Äì has the rise of Objective-C influenced this as much as the [C++11](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh441569(v=VS.85).aspx) standard
*   C++ [AMP](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/nativeconcurrency/archive/2011/09/13/c-amp-in-a-nutshell.aspx) could be beneficial from a quant library perspective ‚Äì think risk/pricing
*   The Metro programming model offer the Abstract Binary Interface (ABI) ‚Äì defines an interface for inter-language communication.
*   COM is [back](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh454076(v=VS.85).aspx) (and update) üôÇ
*   I would have preferred one binary across all Win8 devices ‚Äì phone, slate, PC, etc ‚Äì we don‚Äôt seem to be there yet üò¶
*   Will the CLR merge into WinRT over [time](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh441569(v=VS.85).aspx)?
*   Will Microsoft drop support for Silverlight on OSX?
*   I don‚Äôt see a lot from BUILD so far to help in the cross platform world ‚Äì its all Windows ecosystem centric
*   JavaScript + [WinRT](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh464947) or Managed code + WinRT or native + WinRT ‚Äì your choice on building Metro style apps (full screen)
*   Windows Metadata (WinMD) file is created by VS2011
*   HTML or XAML ‚Äì the choice is yours for [markup](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br211386/)
*   WinJS.[Promise](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/br211867)
