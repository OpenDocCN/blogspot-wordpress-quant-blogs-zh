Happy Election Day!  (Or is it Merry Election Day?)  Here is one view of how the SPX has fared following US elections from 1964 – 2008.

There is not a lot to glean from this.  But I would point out a couple of things.  1) Much of the negative total returns came thanks to the “Max Losing Trade”, which was 2008\. 2) The “Max Winning Trade” over the next week is barely 3%.  So the election has not in years past served as a spark that led to a sharp rally.
