# VIX and More: Portfolio A1 Last Seen in Woodshed

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/07/portfolio-a1-last-seen-in-woodshed.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/07/portfolio-a1-last-seen-in-woodshed.html#0001-01-01)

While the SPX, DJIA and NASDAQ Composite all feel somewhere in the 4.0 - 4.7% range during the past week, Portfolio A1 plummeted 9.2%, dragging the portfolio’s aggregate performance down below that of the benchmark S&P 500 index for the first time in four months.

[Southern Copper (PCU)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=pcu) was the only holding to fare better than the indices, losing 3.3% on the week.  The next ‘best’ performers, [Mobile TeleSystems OJSC (MBT)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=mbt&hl=en) and [Terex (TEX)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=tex&hl=en), fell 7.7% and 8.6 respectively.  Two other holdings logged double digit losses on the week, with [Amkor (AMKR)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=amkr&hl=en) off 11.9% and [Pinnacle Airlines (PNCL)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=pncl&hl=en) plummeting 13.6% by Friday’s closing bell.  Pinnacle’s performance is largely responsible for it being dropped from the portfolio and replaced by [Navistar International (NAVZ)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=navz&hl=en), a stock I owned some 23 years ago when it was [International Harvester](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Harvester).  While the company has had some extremely difficult challenges in the intervening years, a recent [$623 million contract award](http://www.thestreet.com/pf/newsanalysis/general/10363826.html) to the military vehicles division suggests considerable upside potential.  Navistar lost only 1.0% last week and has the potential for a significant upside surprise in more favorable market conditions.

There are no other changes to the portfolio for the coming week.

A snapshot of the portfolio is as follows:
