## Big Mistaken Data?

FT has an interesting [article](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/21a6e7d8-b479-11e3-a09a-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2xZA0w26k) on Big Data.  The closing paragraph summaries the article well:

> “Big data” has arrived, but big insights have not. The challenge now is to solve new problems and gain new answers – without making the same old statistical mistakes on a grander scale than ever.
