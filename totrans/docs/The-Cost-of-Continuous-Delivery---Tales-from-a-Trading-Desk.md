# The Cost of Continuous Delivery | Tales from a Trading Desk

## The Cost of Continuous Delivery

Steve Smith’s InfoQ presentation on “The Death of Continuous Integration” is worth a [watch](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/death-continuous-integration).  As discussed at the start of the presentation, Continuous Delivery comes at a cost to standup.  Benefit are not free!  Pay the cost, get the benefits – no free lunch.  Continuous Delivery doesn’t mean that Continuous Integration is dead.

Feature branching – a dead idea that “kicked” the pain of merging down the road.  Risk high, cost high, etc
