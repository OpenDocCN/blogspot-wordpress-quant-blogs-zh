## Angular 2 – Relief from the madness of Angular 1

Angular 2 appears to be a breath of fresh air compared to the madness of Angular 1 – [$stateProvider](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/wiki) was one of those mad features in my view 🙂 Thankfully, with Angular2 we are back into a component world – not exactly sure why we left, given the history of UI frameworks from the Microsoft .NET and Java UI days.

Documentation appears good as one would expect on the angular site, which an architecture overview [here](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/architecture.html).  Probably most useful is the [cheat](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/cheatsheet.html) sheet.  Nice callout to a pattern everyone should be familiar with:

> [Apply](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/style-guide.html) the Single Responsibility Principle to all components, services, and other symbols. This helps make the app cleaner, easier to read and maintain, and more testable.

In the templates, its worth remembers all the HTML5 [features](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_new_elements.asp) available.
