# Humble Student of the Markets: Constructive value and reflation green shoots

One of my principal tools of market analysis is the use of trend-following techniques to spot changes in macro conditions. My models are seeing some early green shoots in the value and reflation trade. It began with the stronger than expected July Jobs Report. The subsequent tame core CPI print also helped to reinforce the narrative of non-inflationary growth. As a consequence. the value/growth ratio is turning up after exhibiting a positive RSI divergence and relative internals improved. The Russell 1000 Value Index even rallied to a fresh all-time high.

The economic winds are shifting and it may be time for investors to trim their sails.
