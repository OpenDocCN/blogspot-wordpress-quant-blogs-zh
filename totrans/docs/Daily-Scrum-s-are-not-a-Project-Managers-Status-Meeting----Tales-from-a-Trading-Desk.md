## Daily Scrum’s are not a Project Managers Status Meeting!

I think Mike captures the reason for a daily scum clearly in this [article](http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/daily-scrum-not-just-for-scrummasters) – a synchronized meeting for the team MEMBER’s.  It’s not a STATUS MEETING.  I also concur re the eye contact, and I like the Sixteenth [Minute](http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/lets-save-that-discussion-for-the-sixteenth-minute).  As to rotating Scrum Master, have a read of [this](http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/rotating-the-scrummaster-role).  From what I’ve seen over the years, some people are clearly able to act as Scrum Masters, and others just want to be members of the team.  Hence don’t force people into a Scrum Master role who don’t have the skills, and consider Scrum Master training prior – it often opens peoples minds 😉
