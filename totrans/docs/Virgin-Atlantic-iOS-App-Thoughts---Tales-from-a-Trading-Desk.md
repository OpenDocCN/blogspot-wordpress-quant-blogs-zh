# Virgin Atlantic iOS App Thoughts | Tales from a Trading Desk

## Virgin Atlantic iOS App Thoughts

All I can say is the Virgin Atlantic iOS [app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/virgin-atlantic-app/id347564786) is not on par with what [BA](http://www.britishairways.com/) provides.  I can’t see my current flight details, or my up and coming flights, and forget about electronic boarding cards.  With regards to quality of services, I think BA and Virgin Atlantic could learn a lot from [Etihad](http://www.etihad.com) and [Emirates](http://www.emirates.com).

Final point on Virgin Atlantic.  When you’ve watched the safety video, they kindly tell you that you can watch the films immediately as long as you ONLY use the Virgin Atlantic headsets.  Problem is that they only hand out the headsets once they have taken off – total madness 😦
