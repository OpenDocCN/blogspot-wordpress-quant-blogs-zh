## “As a developer..” my skills are not updated

When I started as a software engineer, I realised very quickly you had to stay on top of your game.  This essentially meant keeping up with the latest framework, and moving from language to language – riding the trends.  Clearly, the key was picking the correct trend to follow.  In the last few years the explosion of frameworks and languages has caused the trend picking to become more complex, but not impossible.  Its also in some ways, generate a new trend in a subset of software engineers.  This new trend is effectively the “one trick pony” – software engineers stuck in a loop of one software stack believing that there is no better way to code – they can’t be bothered to re-skill and adapt.  In many ways, their careers are over, they just don’t realise it.
