Michael Casey has written

[a nice short essay](http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2013/07/10/fx-horizons-move-over-economists-time-to-give-physicists-a-turn/)

in the Wall Street Journal on the topic of econophysics, and more generally the physics-inspired research program into economics and finance. I'm flattered to see that he gives my book a prominent mention. The article is definitely worth a read, no doubt... but then, I would say that, wouldn't I?
