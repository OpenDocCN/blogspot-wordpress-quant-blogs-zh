## What happens when Non-Functional Requirements (NFR) are forgotten

“Behind the Curtain of the HealthCare.gov [Rollout](http://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Healthcare-gov-Report-Final-9-17-14.pdf)” offer a few excellent quotes.  I particularly like the quote around the number of concurrent users:

> After the launch, HHS officials sharply criticized CMS’s management leading up to the launch of Healthcare.gov. Referencing an email in which a CMS official admits the system could not handle more than 500 concurrent users, Mr. Baitman wrote “Frankly, it’s worse than I imagined!” and Mr. Sivak replied, “Anyone who has any software experience at all would read that and immediately ask what the fuck you were thinking by launching.”
> 
> “These bugs were functions of volume…. Take away the volume and it works.”

Clearly from the above some basic principles around project management, software engineering and requirements were “forgotten”
