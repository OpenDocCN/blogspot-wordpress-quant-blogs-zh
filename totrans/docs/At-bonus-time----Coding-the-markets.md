## At bonus time…

### April 2, 2007

Read [“At Bonus Time, No-one Can Hear You Scream”](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Bonus-Time-No-one-Hear-Scream/dp/1904027318) at the weekend. It’s a first person fictional narrative about an investment banker in the weeks leading up to comp day. And it’s a nasty little book. The few good guys get turned over, and so do many of the devious, amoral slime merchants too. It may be an accurate picture of the worst aspects of trading floor culture, but it’s neither amusing nor edifying.
