# DV Bands Follow Up | CSSA

> 来源：[https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2009/09/01/dv-bands-follow-up/#0001-01-01](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2009/09/01/dv-bands-follow-up/#0001-01-01)

To my loyal followers–fear not, I have not disappeared, I am currently overloaded with consulting projects. The long overdue  post on the CVI will be up soon, and I think most of you will find it extremely interesting. An astute trader and friend of the blog–Ramon Cummins–has done some additional research on DV Bands across several different instruments to test for robustness. Below is an excerpt of the email Ramon sent me:

Hi David

I had some time this weekend to do some more thorough testing of your DV Bands. I coded up a system in Amibroker to test the efficacy of the DV Bands across a portfolio of four watchlists, with average results below and detailed individual ticker results in the excel file attached. Some notes;

–          I limited the test to only include tickers with 750+ bars of data
–          I’ve used the term ‘price containment’ to quantify whether the bands ‘contained’ the closing price the next day.

|   |   | **Next Day Price Containment** |   |   |
|   | # of tickers | Bollinger Bands | DV Bands | Improvement |
| ETFs | 304 | 82.1% | 90.7% | 8.6% |
| S&P500 | 483 | 81.7% | 89.7% | 8.0% |
| Nasdaq 100 | 98 | 81.8% | 90.0% | 8.2% |
| Russell 1000 | 914 | 81.7% | 89.9% | 8.2% |

The results speak for themselves – the DV Bands ‘contain’ next day prices approximately 8% more of the time than traditional Bollinger Bands.

This is great stuff, thanks for your refreshing contributions – now I just need to develop a system to trade them.  
Cheers

Ramon
