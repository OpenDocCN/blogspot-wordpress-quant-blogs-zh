# Humble Student of the Markets: A swine flu stress test for the market

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2009/04/swine-flu-stress-test-for-market.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2009/04/swine-flu-stress-test-for-market.html#0001-01-01)

I have written

[before](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2009/04/stabilization-is-not-recovery.html)

that we are likely experiencing a bear market rally in equities. We have seen signs of capitulation by

[bears](http://macro-man.blogspot.com/2009/04/short-covering-and-kubler-ross-cycle.html)

and

[short-sellers](http://247wallst.com/2009/04/26/short-sellers-abandon-financial-shares-tech-stocks/)

. William Hester of Hussman Funds concurred with this view, see his

[incisive analysis](http://www.hussmanfunds.com/rsi/rallyvolume.htm)

of volume behavior in previous rallies. Mark Hulbert is more agnostic on the rally vs. renewed bull controversy, but

[indicated](http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/A-retest-March-9-lows/story.aspx?guid=%7BFFD7B0D6%2D6A71%2D4295%2DBC7B%2D001734EB1E80%7D)

that we will likely see a re-test of the March lows.

All this debate is well and good, but why did the market continue to rise? And what is the market going to do now?

**The acid test**

As I write this fair value on S&P 500 futures is down just under 2% as

[news](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=avEHg48g1qUg&refer=worldwide)

broke that the World Health Organization declared an outbreak of a previously unknown swine flu virus "a public health emergency of international concern." WHO Director-General Margaret Chan indicated the outbreak has “pandemic potential.” (For possible market effects of this illness, here are some sample

and

[bearish](http://www.businessinsider.com/swine-flu-pandemic-would-cost-trillions-2009-4)

views).

This equity rally has been characterized by leadership by Financials and low-quality, beaten up stocks, or a manifestation of the

[Phoenix effect](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2008/05/waiting-for-ride-on-phoenix.html)

. If this news panics the markets in the days to come, watch how the leadership behaves to gauge the resiliency of the rally.
