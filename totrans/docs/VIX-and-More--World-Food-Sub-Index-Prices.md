# VIX and More: World Food Sub-Index Prices

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2011/01/world-food-sub-index-prices.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2011/01/world-food-sub-index-prices.html#0001-01-01)

Sometimes I just don’t know when to leave well enough alone, particularly when it involves that Holy Grailesque quest to cram every potentially relevant piece of data into one overcrowded chart.

Yesterday’s [Chart of the Week: World Food Prices](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2011/01/chart-of-week-world-food-prices.html) is an example of a relatively uncluttered chart that attempts to make one or two simple points in a relatively clear and concise manner. After some back and forth with several readers, I have elected to butcher that simplicity and unveil a chart which adds the five sub-indices: meat; dairy; cereal; oils and sugar. The result, which I have appended below, shows that the real wild card in world food prices has been sugar, which is represented on the chart by the green line. To a lesser extent, cereal, dairy and oil have had their moments of extreme price fluctuations. By far the least volatile of the five sub-groups has been meat.

For those who are looking beyond futures to ETPs which can replicate some of these [commodity](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/commodities) sub-indices, there are a number of broad-based agricultural ETFs which cover most or all of the sub-indices. The popular PowerShares DB Agriculture Fund ([DBA](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/DBA)) is by far the most liquid of the group. Alternatives to DBA include [RJA](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/RJA), [JJA](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/JJA), [FUD](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/FUD) and [UAG](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/UAG). For investors looking to target grains, [JJG](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/JJG) and [GRU](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/GRU) are worth investigating, as is the corn-specific ETP, [CORN](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/CORN). For the sugar sub-index, [SGG](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SGG) is an excellent match. [JJS](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/JJS) is an ETP for the ‘softs’ space and is almost equally weighted between coffee, cotton and sugar. Finally, both [COW](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/COW) and [UBC](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/UBC) are potential proxies for the meat sub-index.
