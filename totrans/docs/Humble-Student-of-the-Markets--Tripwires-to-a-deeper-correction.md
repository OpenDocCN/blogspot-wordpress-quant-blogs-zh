# Humble Student of the Markets: Tripwires to a deeper correction

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2023/09/tripwires-to-deeper-correction.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2023/09/tripwires-to-deeper-correction.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models** 

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post, 

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The 

**Trend Asset Allocation Model**

 is an asset allocation model that applies trend-following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity prices. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. The performance and full details of a model portfolio based on the out-of-sample signals of the Trend Model can be found

[here](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/trend-model-report-card/)

.

My inner trader uses a 

**trading model**

, which is a blend of price momentum (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa). Subscribers receive real-time alerts of model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of the email alerts is updated weekly

. The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that began in March 2016 is shown below.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Buy equities (Last changed from “sell” on 28-Jul-2023)*
*   Trend Model signal: Bullish (Last changed from “neutral” on 28-Jul-2023)*
*   Trading model: Neutral (Last changed from “bearish” on 03-Aug-2023)*

#### Where’s the bottom?

I highlighted how the 5-week RSI of the S&P 500 became extremely overbought. In the past, such instances have resolved with a correction (check), a relief rally (check), followed by a re-test of the correction lows. In three of the last four cases, the second re-test held at the old lows. The only exception was the COVID Crash of 2020, which was panic driven by macro fundamentals. If history is any guide, the next corrective low should terminate at about the site of the August low, which is ~4350. 

While my base case is a bottom at about 4350, I nevertheless have to allow for the possibility of a deeper correction. Here’s what I am watching.
