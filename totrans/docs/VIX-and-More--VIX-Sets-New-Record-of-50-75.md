# VIX and More: VIX Sets New Record of 50.75

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/10/vix-sets-new-record-of-4986.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/10/vix-sets-new-record-of-4986.html#0001-01-01)

Given market conditions, the levels of the VIX continue to suggest an orderly selloff, with the VIX still being held back by a strong gravitational pull.

If the DJIA fails to hold the psychologically important 10,000 level, we might see more in the way of anxiety.

Genuine panic should put 55 and perhaps 60 in play very quickly.
