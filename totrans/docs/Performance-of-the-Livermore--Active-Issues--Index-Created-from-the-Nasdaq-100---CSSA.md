David (and all),

Intrigued by your index and above all by the astonishing performance, I attempt to understand what could hide behind that Livermore Index. To guess your filter and try to replicate the findings of your Top10, I tried to read between the lines. Here my guesses and approach (which was initiated by luck, but as said Edison inventions are 70% made of luck):
1) What is a strong stock, I guess one that does not correct much while always going higher: the recent performance of a stock for a break-out system (à la O’Neill, Livermore or Darvas 😉 with a close stop and an exit with a low DV2 should tell you about that => My first indicator
2) You mentionned volumes… A strong stock always climbs on more volume than during its corrections. What about a ratio of the sum of the volume of positive days by the sum of the volume of the negative days => My second indicator
3) I want a minimum of volume, i.e. minimum daily out of x days > 300,000
4) Like O’Neill and Livermore, let’s not trade stocks in the low figures. Minimum = 10$
5) I combine the 2 indicators, include filters for volume and price and take the bests of the class.

Here my picks:
1) Nasdaq: HGSI, BEXP, SVNT, VMED & ISRG
2) NYSE: UFS, OSK, GOL, SOA & VCI
