## Updates for Proportional Minimum Variance and Adaptive Shrinkage methods

I create supporting pages for two projects I have collaborated with [David Varadi](http://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2013/10/24/adaptive-shrinkage/) in 2013:

Please check the links to get more info, including supporting blog posts, back-tests, R code to reproduce the back-tests, and more to come in the near future.

I and [David](http://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2013/10/24/adaptive-shrinkage/) appreciate your feedback and comments.
