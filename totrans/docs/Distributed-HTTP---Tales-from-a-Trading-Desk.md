## Distributed HTTP

[mnot](https://www.mnot.net/blog/2015/08/18/distributed_http) and [brewster Kahle](http://brewster.kahle.org/2015/08/11/locking-the-web-open-a-call-for-a-distributed-web-2/) both have interesting articles on a possible future for the web, distributed HTTP.  Technologies that may help in the moved to distributed HTTP include JavaScript, Bitcoin, IPFS/Bittorrent, Namecoin, and others.  Namecoin is interesting, and in many ways could possible be the future for DNS?
