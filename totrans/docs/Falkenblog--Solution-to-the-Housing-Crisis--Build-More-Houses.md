# Falkenblog: Solution to the Housing Crisis: Build More Houses

> 来源：[http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2008/07/solution-to-housing-crisis-build-more.html#0001-01-01](http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2008/07/solution-to-housing-crisis-build-more.html#0001-01-01)

In the housing bill, there's a provision to

[build more affordable houses](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/30/AR2008073002950.html)

. So the current problem is house prices are too low. One of their solutions is predicated on the fact that they are, or will be, too high. Lest you think this is an anomaly, note that politicians and many journalists bemoan the high cost of gas, while trying to cut our carbon footprint.

This is a main reason why I think government should be shrunk. When it tries to do something, it just becomes a Christmas tree of giveaways to special interest groups like

, often with inconsistent objectives.

Prices too low, too high, whatever. The key is,

government

is going to do something. Yea!
