# VIX and More: Portfolio A1 Reconsiders DryShips (DRYS)

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/10/portfolio-a1-reconsiders-dryships-drys.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/10/portfolio-a1-reconsiders-dryships-drys.html#0001-01-01)

Last week I [expressed my surprise](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/10/portfolio-a1-jumps-5-in-week.html) that the portfolio had decided to sell out its position in [DryShips (DRYS)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=drys&hl=en) after the stock registered a 27% gain in just four weeks in the portfolio.  In retrospect, my skepticism looks warranted, as DRYS logged an 8.9% gain last week, while the stock it was replaced with, [Shanda Interactive (SNDA)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=snda&hl=en), was only able to add 0.3% during the week.  That differential, which meant a net of about 1.7% to Portfolio A1 last week, accounts for all of the 1.4% lost relative to the benchmark S&P 500 index last week.

Ironically, Portfolio A1’s stock ranking system has reconsidered this week and decided to add [DryShips (DRYS)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=drys&hl=en) once again, while dropping the one other stock that has had two round trips in the portfolio: [Terex (TEX)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=tex&hl=en).

While Portfolio A1 continues to try to run down the S&P 500, I am refining the [next iteration](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/08/portfolio-a1-looks-to-ag-to-stop.html) of my public portfolio in the background and am readying for a January 1, 2008 launch.  One of the most important changes is that this portfolio will *not* be a 100% mechanical system.  It will be partly discretionary, so that I will be able to make decisions along the lines of overriding a sell signal in DRYS, if I don’t think it is appropriate.

There are no other changes to the portfolio this week.

A snapshot of the portfolio is as follows:
