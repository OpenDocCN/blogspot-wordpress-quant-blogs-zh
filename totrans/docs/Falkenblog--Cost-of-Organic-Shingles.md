My neighborhood was built around 2001, and now all my neighbors have to replace our roofs. It seems the trendy roofing tile was this

but new roofs cost between $8 and $25k depending, and so this is a costly mistake. Many are getting their insurance company to pay via 'hail damage' clauses, but most don't.

I have a feeling that when they were selling these organic shingles they were heralded as being green and progressive. The new fiberglass shingles should last 50 years or more, but unlike the old ones, you can't eat them.
