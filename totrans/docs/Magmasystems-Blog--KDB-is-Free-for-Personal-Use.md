# Magmasystems Blog: KDB is Free for Personal Use

> 来源：[http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2008/04/kdb-is-free-for-personal-use.html#0001-01-01](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2008/04/kdb-is-free-for-personal-use.html#0001-01-01)

I haven't blogged in about a month ... I have a ton to say, but I have just been too busy with the new employees who have joined my Complex Event Processing team (welcome

Hanno

, Scott and

Feng

). But this great news from

Tenerife

Joel is just too good to pass up.

On this blog a few month ago, we got on the case of

KX

Systems for making it virtually impossible to download, evaluate and learn if you were not a member of a large financial institution. Several people commented here that they really wanted to check out

KDB

, but they did not know how to get access to it.

I guess that Simon and Niall have seen the light, and are now making

KDB

available for

[personal use](http://kx.com/developers/software.php)

.

I would like to take all of the credit for this revelation, but I suspect that one of the motivating factors for

KX

Systems was the free, unrestricted availability of Coral8 for personal use. Any random person can download a personal-use, single-CPU version of the Coral8 server and development studio for no charge .... this version does not have any restrictions nor any time limits (are you listening,

Aleri

?).

During our evaluation of

CEP

systems, we found that Coral8 was the only company that did not put up any barriers to evaluation.

Aleri

had an annoying time limit.

Apama

wouldn't even let us download anything without having to run through their marketing gauntlet.

Streambase

directly gave us a copy of their product, so I am not sure if

Streambase

has any barriers to evaluation.

All of the

CEP

vendors face the conundrum of giving out unrestricted copies of their software vs fully qualifying prospective customers. I can understand this from the standpoint of support ... your

technical

support staff has a limited amount of time, and it usually has to be spent supporting the larger institutions, the ones who will most likely be dishing out several hundred thousand dollars for a license. But, today's independent hacker might be tomorrow's corporate developer .... and goodwill goes a long way.

So, congrats to Simon and Niall from KX. Here's hoping that a new generation of KDB developers will come out of this effort, and as a result, a wider set of tools is available for KDB.
