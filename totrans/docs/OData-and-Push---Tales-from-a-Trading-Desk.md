# OData and Push | Tales from a Trading Desk

> 来源：[https://mdavey.wordpress.com/2010/02/09/odata-and-push/#0001-01-01](https://mdavey.wordpress.com/2010/02/09/odata-and-push/#0001-01-01)

## OData and Push

Douglas [Purdy](http://www.douglaspurdy.com/2010/02/08/odata-a-personal-scenario/) calls on the financial industry to expose data using [OData](http://www.douglaspurdy.com/2010/02/01/odata-the-movie/). Maybe Lightstreamer, my-Channels, Kaazing etc should consider supporting [OData](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/data/default.aspx) as well since some of us live in more of a Push world than a HTTP request/response world 🙂
