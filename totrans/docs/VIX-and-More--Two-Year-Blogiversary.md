# VIX and More: Two Year Blogiversary

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/01/two-year-blogiversary.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/01/two-year-blogiversary.html#0001-01-01)

With all the excitement of the trading day, the VIX back up to 42.55 as I type this, and my share of technical issues (MyBlogLog, if would be nice if you could go back to tracking more than 20% of my traffic), I forgot that today is the two year anniversary of VIX and More.

Thanks to [Adam Warner](http://adamsoptions.blogspot.com/), [Jim Kingsland](http://buttonwood1792.blogspot.com/2008/06/buttonwood-speculator-is-going.html), [Barry Ritholtz](http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/) and a host of others who offered their early encouragement back when I could count my visitors on my hands and toes.

For those who may be interested, the first post, [VIX and More: An Introduction](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/01/week-in-vix-january-7-2007-introduction.html), still has some nuggets that are relevant for today’s market. My favorite post from that first month, however, is undoubtedly [What My Dog Can Tell Us About Volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/01/what-my-dog-can-tell-us-about_947.html).

Thanks to all who have made contributions of one kind or another to this effort over the course of the past two years.
