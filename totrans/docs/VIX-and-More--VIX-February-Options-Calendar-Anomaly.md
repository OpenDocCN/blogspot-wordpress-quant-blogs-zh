# VIX and More: VIX February Options Calendar Anomaly

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/02/vix-february-options-calendar-anomaly.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/02/vix-february-options-calendar-anomaly.html#0001-01-01)

Just a quick note to remind anyone who is trading VIX options that the [February options expirations calendar](http://www.theocc.com/publications/xcal/xcal2008.pdf) [which is pinned at the bottom of the "VIX & Sentiment Links" in the upper right hand corner of the blog] has some unusual features that are the result of the timing of Good Friday, which falls on expiration week in March this year.

Without getting into all the details, the bottom line is that the *expiration day* for February's VIX options is ***Tuesday***, February 19^(th), instead of the usual Wednesday.  With the President’s Day holiday falling on Monday the 18^(th), this moves the *last trading day* in VIX options up to ***Friday***, February 15^(th) – the day after tomorrow. Note that the same expiration and last trading dates also apply to [VXN](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXN) and [RVX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/RVX) options.

Anyone who wishes to dive into the details of the VIX options calendar and other related information is encouraged to brush up on the [VIX options contract specifications](http://www.cboe.com/micro/vix/VIXoptionsQRG.pdf).
