![](img/6c8141d93aa37e87fcd039f90373aa30.png)[Euronext](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euronext), the European arm of [NYSE Euronext](http://www.nyse.com/), recently [announced](http://www.euronext.com/editorial/wide/editorial-8813-EN.html) the creation of three new volatility indices: the AEX Volatility Index; the BEL 20 Volatility Index; and the CAC 40 Volatility Index. These indices will be calculated in the same manner as the current VIX methodology and will be launched on September 3, 2007.

Euronext has also [historical data available for download](http://www.euronext.com/fic/000/023/446/234469.xls) for all three indices and has some summary information available for each index:

The three new volatility indices will compete with the [VDAX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VDAX), which is the incumbent volatility index of choice for the European markets and also a product of the [Deutsche Börse](http://deutsche-boerse.com/dbag/dispatch/de/kir/gdb_navigation/home).

It should come as no surprise that volatility products are proliferating in the <country-region st="on"><place st="on">US</place></country-region> and across the globe, with volatility in the headlines as of late, demand for these products growing rapidly, and the battle for supremacy among the major exchanges heating up at the same time. I wonder, though, given that we already have a volatility index for the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, do we gain anything significant by adding new ones for <city st="on">Amsterdam</city>, <city st="on">Brussels</city> and <city st="on"><place st="on">Paris</place></city> as well?
