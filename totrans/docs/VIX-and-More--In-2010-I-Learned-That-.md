# VIX and More: In 2010 I Learned That…

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/12/in-2010-i-learned-that.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/12/in-2010-i-learned-that.html#0001-01-01)

Josh Brown of [The Reformed Broker](http://www.thereformedbroker.com/) has an excellent post up today, [In 2010 I Learned That…](http://www.thereformedbroker.com/2010/12/31/in-2010-i-learned-that/), in which he aggregates a wide variety of market perspectives from his broad network. The results have a large dollop of market wisdom, yet are spiced with the type of humor and satire that is a hallmark of Josh’s efforts.

When asked for some input about what I learned in 2010, my immediate reaction what that I hadn't learned as much in 2010 as I had in 2009 and 2008\. After a moment of reflection, five ideas tumbled out of my head, in the following order:

1.  Substantial profits can be made from surfing the bleeding edge of Wall Street's product development engine *(this is the one Josh chose to include in his post)*
2.  The more confident you are in the value of your primary strategies, the more difficult it is (should be) to pull the trigger on other strategies/trades with less impressive or uncertain prospects
3.  There is a huge desire for investors to understand the [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures) [term structure](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/term%20structure) and its implications
4.  When you combine ETFs and options, almost any possible trade idea can be implemented
5.  A good portfolio is one that funds a good vacation without the need for frequent monitoring of positions *(my wife’s favorite of this group)*

[As an aside, while Josh has a penchant for nailing the humorous side of the investment world, his

[On a Personal Note…](http://www.thereformedbroker.com/2010/12/30/on-a-personal-note/)

from yesterday shows his talent for writing about the poignant as well.]

Readers, what have you learned in 2010? Feel free to hit up the comments…
