# Humble Student of the Markets: The gold bulls' final defense

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2013/06/the-gold-bulls-final-defense.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2013/06/the-gold-bulls-final-defense.html#0001-01-01)

OK, so gold had a very ugly day. For some perspective, here is the long-term chart of gold stretching back to the start of the last gold bull:

This precious metal recently dropped through one important uptrend (dotted line). There is, however, one ultimate last line of defense for the gold bulls, which represents the uptrend stretching back to 2001 (solid line). Uptrend support appears to be at roughly $1150.

There are a number of hopeful signs for gold, at least in the short-term. Tim Knight at

indicated that silver may be forming a bottom at these levels:

As well,

[Ed Yardeni](http://blog.yardeni.com/2013/06/gold-tips-excerpt.html)

showed that there is a high level of correlation between gold prices and TIPS:

Here is a short-term chart of GLD and TIP. TIP rallied today, though GLD sold off. This represents a short-term divergence, though minor, that cannot go on forever.

In short, precious metals appear to be setting up for a relief rally at these levels. However, keep an eye on the longer term trend to judge whether the gold bulls' last stand is successful or not.
