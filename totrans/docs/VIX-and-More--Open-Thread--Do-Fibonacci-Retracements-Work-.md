# VIX and More: Open Thread: Do Fibonacci Retracements Work?

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/06/open-thread-do-fibonacci-retracements.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/06/open-thread-do-fibonacci-retracements.html#0001-01-01)

Following my recent [Dueling Fibonaccis for the SPX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/06/dueling-fibonaccis-for-spx.html), a reader asked if I knew of any 'scientific' studies that attempted to evaluate the usefulness of Fibonacci retracement levels. The short answer is that I am unaware of any detailed studies, nor was I able to dig up anything meaningful with a [search of SSRN](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/06/dueling-fibonaccis-for-spx.html).

So I turn this topic over to readers:

*   Do Fibonacci numbers work as a trading tool?

*   Are you aware of any published analysis which evealuates Fibonacci retracement levels?
