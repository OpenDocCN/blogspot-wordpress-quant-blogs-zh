# Magmasystems Blog: Analysts and the Vendors They Cover

> 来源：[http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2008/05/analysts-and-vendors-they-cover.html#0001-01-01](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2008/05/analysts-and-vendors-they-cover.html#0001-01-01)

I received the following invitation the other day:

***WEBCAST INVITATION*** ***The Data Management Challenge of Quantitative Analysis*** ****Vhayu invites you to join industry leaders in market data and analytics for a one-hour webcast hosted by Aite Group.*** ***Speakers include:
Sang Lee, Co-founder & Managing Partner / Aite Group*** ***Jeff Hudson, CEO / Vhayu Technologies*** ***David Wilson, Product Manager / Vhayu Technologies*** Vhayu

has come up with something that they think is an interesting product. Congrats to Jeff, Ross, and the rest of the gang at

Vhayu

.

However, what is interesting is the fact that they have enlisted

Aite

group (one of the founders, no less) to host a publicity event.

We look to companies like

Gartner

, Tabb, and

Aite

to give us a fairly objective, unbiased look at the technology landscape in the financial sector. However, the presence of an "impartial" analyst and a vendor always gives me an uneasy feeling.

In the dot com era, there was a company/website called Gomez. This company rated the daily effectiveness of online brokers. In fact,

CNBC

featured The Gomez Report every morning during the go-go years of the late 90's and early 2000's.

However

, Gomez had banner ads on their website from the brokers who they were supposedly rating.

My opinion is that, if you are going to position yourself as an analyst, you need to give an air of impartiality, and you need to give full disclosure. What is the relationship between

Vhayu

and

Aite

? Is

Aite

receiving any compensation for hosting a

webcast

that is being created and sponsored by

Vhayu

? Will Sang Lee agree to host a

similar webcast

for

Vhayu's

competitors? Will Sang Lee mention any of

Vhayu's

competitors during his opening remarks?

For me, there is a bit of a cloud that hangs over any analyst that chooses to associate himself with a particular company.

I like what the

Gartner

Group does. When I speak at their conference in September, they will not let me speak about, nor will they allow questions about specific vendors. There are no explicit or implicit vendor endorsements allowed when I am on the podium. If a vendor wants to exhibit at a

Gartner

conference, then they are confined to the vendor area. And, there is no question that

Gartner

is getting compensated by the vendors for this.
