# VIX and More: Fibonacci Retracements and Trading Ranges

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/10/fibonacci-retracements-and-trading.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/10/fibonacci-retracements-and-trading.html#0001-01-01)

Most traders are reasonably knowledgeable about [Fibonacci retracements](http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/FibonacciRetracement.asp), which predict the likely percentage retracement of any preceding up or down move.  The details of Fibonacci retracements are discussed in [many places](http://www.swing-trade-stocks.com/fibonacci-retracements.html) on the web, so I won’t repeat them here other than to note that the most commonly used [Fibonacci numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) are the retracement percentages of 38.2%, 50%, and 61.8%.  When markets move sharply in one direction, then turn around, the first question traders tend to ask themselves is how long the move will last.  The usual suspects are previous closes, moving averages and “Fibs.”

Even if you don’t believe in what some consider to be the equivalent of numerical astrology, the important thing is that other traders do and right or wrong, they can make Fibs a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Part of the reason I mention all of this is that the NASDAQ composite just retraced about 61.8% of the recent drop and now is finding resistance at the Fibonacci level.  The chart below tells much of this story, but the pressing question is what happens next.  There is a temptation to assume that the bulls will eventually win out once again or that this time it looks like the bears finally have the numbers…but there is a third possibility, that we may be entering into a trading range.  Once again, it is way too early to determine whether this may be the case, but today’s stalemate (so far) opens up that possibility.  IF we are going to be in a trading range for awhile, expect Fibonacci levels to play an important role in defining the trading range, along with the other usual suspects.

Also, keep in mind that if we are in a trading range and volatility expectations continue to be on the high side, a [covered call (or buy-write) fund](http://www.thestreet.com/_yahoo/funds/toponepercent/10340878.html?cm_ven=YAHOO&cm_cat=FREE&cm_ite=NA), like market leader [BEP](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=bep), is an excellent low risk way to beat the market.
