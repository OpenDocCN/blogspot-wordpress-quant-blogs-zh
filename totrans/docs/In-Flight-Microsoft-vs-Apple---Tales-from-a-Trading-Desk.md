## In-Flight Microsoft vs Apple

A few flights ago, whilst on Qantas I was greeted on-board by an red covered iPad in the seat pocket – the new way to delivery in-flight [entertainment](http://www.qantas.com.au/travel/airlines/wireless-inflight-entertainment/au/en).  Delta appears to be going the Microsoft Surface route for flight [documentations](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/10/01/delta_buys_11000_surface_2_slabs/).  Curious if Delta will also go the in-flight entertainment road as well.
