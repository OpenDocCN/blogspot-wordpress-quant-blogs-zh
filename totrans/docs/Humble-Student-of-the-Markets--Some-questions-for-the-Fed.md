# Humble Student of the Markets: Some questions for the Fed

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2020/09/some-questions-for-fed.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2020/09/some-questions-for-fed.html#0001-01-01)

As the FOMC conducts its two-day meeting after its big reveal of its shift in monetary policy, Fed watcher [Tim Duy](https://blogs.uoregon.edu/timduyfedwatch/2020/09/15/fomc-meeting-not-likely-to-deliver-new-details/) thinks that we won't get much more in the way of details from the Fed after this meeting:

> The odds favor the Fed maintains the status quo at this week’s meeting. It does not appear to have a consensus on enhancing forward guidance nor do I suspect FOMC participants feel pressure to force a consensus on that topic just yet. The general improvement in the data likely removes that pressure. The Fed will likely remain content to use the new strategy as justification for maintaining the current near zero rate path. Powell will continue to lean heavily on downside risks to the economy to entrench expectations that the Fed will stick to that path. The dovish risk this week is that the Fed does surprise with either more specific guidance or an alteration of the asset purchase program to favor longer term bonds. I don’t see a lot of risk for a hawkish outcome unless it was something unintentional in the press conference.

As the Citi Inflation Surprise Index edges up for the US, but remain muted for the other major regions, I have some important questions about the Fed's new "average inflation target" policy.
