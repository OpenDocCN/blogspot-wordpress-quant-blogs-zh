# VIX and More: CBOE Offers New VIX Term Structure Data

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/10/cboe-offers-new-vix-term-structure-data.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/10/cboe-offers-new-vix-term-structure-data.html#0001-01-01)

I noticed today that the [CBOE](http://www.cboe.com/) has decided to devote a portion of the VIX section of their web site to VIX [term structure](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/term%20structure) information. The CBOE’s [VIX term structure page](http://www.cboe.com/micro/vix/vixtermstructure.aspx), which I believe is new as of yesterday of today, uses yesterday’s data and has a graph of the term structure of the VIX and a table of VIX term structure data going out through December 2010\. In addition, there is a downloadable spreadsheet with historical term structure data going back to 1992.

For those interested in getting a better sense of the VIX, understanding the term structure of the VIX is an essential step in that process.
