## The Clarkson/Hammond/May (Top Gear) Software Stack

A few interesting comments have appeared on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com) recently regards “Stealth Venture”.  More interesting is the job postings, as can be seen [here](http://tech-tri.be/candidates/9-mandates/16-neo4j-scala-developer), building:

> next-generation media business within auto, that will be a blend of content, commerce and social

Looks like they’ve picked an interesting set of technologies:

> AWS, Node.js, Nginx, ElasticSearch, Redis, SQL, Docker, Cypher (Neo4j), Akka and Play Framework (Scala), Typesafe

On the Neo4j front, lets hope they go the extension/plugin road, otherwise they are in for some pain I suspect.

Nice to see they are offering options.
