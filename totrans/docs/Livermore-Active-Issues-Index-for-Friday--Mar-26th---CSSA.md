Hi David,

Thank you for the blog, love reading it.

I have a general methodological question. I noticed all your tests are frictionless, is there a reason for this? I realize presenting frictionless results has value, but so does presenting with friction, as many edges disappear or radically erode with friction. I’ll go further and say that a frictionless result does not even prove price anomaly in the academic sense (EMT definition of price anomaly). Interested to hear your take on why not present both results.

Best –
