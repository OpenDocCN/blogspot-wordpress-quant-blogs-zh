For readers who live in the New York area, here is an interesting upcoming seminar at Columbia University:

The subprime mortgage crisis of 2007: Anatomy of a market failure

Date: 03-10-2008

Start Time: 6:00pm

End Time: 7:30pm

Speaker: Kenneth A. Posner, Morgan Stanley

Location: 412 Schapiro CEPSR, Davis Auditorium

ABSTRACT

As home prices soared in 2004-5, consumers, realtors, mortgage lenders,

homebuilders, and investment banks all benefited. But few thought the good

times would last -- after all, everyone had learned to recognize a bubble

when they saw one. If that's the case, how did mortgage losses turn out so

large, and why do we find ourselves today confronting a major financial

crisis? This presentation will survey the damage resulting from the

subprime mortgage crash and provide a possible explanation for the magnitude

of the surprise which may be relevant to investors and risk managers in

other markets.
