## Organization Transformation: Influence Employee Mindsets and Behavior

McKinsey has an interesting article on [organisation](http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/the-four-building-blocks--of-change) change, “The four building blocks of change”.  Four actions are called out:

*   Role Modelling
*   Fostering understanding and conviction
*   Developing talent and skills
*   Reinforcing with formal mechanisms

Which leads to this obvious statement, but useful reminder:

> leaders develop a change story that helps all stakeholders understand where the company is headed, why it is changing, and why this change is important. Building in a feedback loop to sense how the story is being received is also useful. These change stories not only help get out the message but also, recent research finds, serve as an effective influencing tool. Stories are particularly effective in selling brands
