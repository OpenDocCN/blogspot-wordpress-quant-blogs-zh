## Omega and Mesos

“Return of the Borg: How Twitter Rebuilt Google’s Secret Weapon” on [Wired](http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/03/google-borg-twitter-mesos/all/?utm_source=feedly) provides an overview of how Google is moving from Borg to [Omega](http://eurosys2013.tudos.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/paper/Schwarzkopf.pdf), and Twitter on the Mesos road.  [Mesos](http://incubator.apache.org/mesos/) provides isolation of tasks via the Linux [container](http://lxc.sourceforge.net/) which has gained traction for obvious reasons.

Watching the 2011 GAFS Omega John Wilkes [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZFMlO98Jkc) and reading the articles linked above, one can’t help thinking that DataSynapse and Platform did well to sell to TIBCO and IBM over the last few years, as in many ways, there products are dead today.  Let’s hope the banks, who historically have had the typical desk silo’d compute cluster calculating risk etc (paying licensing fees to DataSyanpse/Platform) are looking at the advances that Twitter and Google are making in resourcing sharing.
