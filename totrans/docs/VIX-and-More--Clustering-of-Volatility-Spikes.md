# VIX and More: Clustering of Volatility Spikes

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2017/02/clustering-of-volatility-spikes.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2017/02/clustering-of-volatility-spikes.html#0001-01-01)

When it comes to measuring volatility clusters I am of the opinion that realized or

[historical volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/historical%20volatility)

is a more important measurement than

[implied volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/implied%20volatility)

measurements, such as is provided by the VIX.  When I think in terms of

[VIX spikes](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20spikes)

, I generally focus on two single-day realized volatility thresholds:  a 2% decline in the S&P 500 Index and a 4% decline.

Note also that in spite of all the talk in the past few years of the potential implosion of the euro zone, a hard landing in

, central banks across the globe creating the seeds of our destruction, increasingly bipartisan politics creating deep divides across the nation, etc., etc. – volatility has been relatively mild during the past 5-6 years.

The interesting thing about volatility regimes is that they eventually transition from low volatility environments to high volatility environments and vice versa and create what I call

[VIX macro cycles](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20macro%20cycles)

in the process.  The

[volatility transition phases](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/volatility%20transition%20phase)

are some of the most interesting times in the market and can certainly be some of the most profitable.  These inflection points are sure to be a target of some of my future writing on volatility.

So, as

*VIX and More*

sails off into its second decade of publication, I vow to flesh out some of my evolving thinking on subjects I have touched upon above (some of which have lain dormant in this space for several years) at the same time I charge off into new areas.  While I will continue to have a laser focus on volatility (particularly its global, multi-asset class aspects), it is time to pay more attention to the “

[and More](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/and%20More)

” portion of this title of this blog and make a push into new frontiers.  Said another way:  my thinking likes to cluster, but it likes to spike as well.

Finally, most posts tend to touch on one or two key ideas, so I typically put a half dozen or so links below that I refer to as “Related posts.”  Today, it seems as if I have touched briefly on so many subjects that more links (I’m sure today’s is a new record) seem appropriate and instead of referring to these as related posts, they are now officially Further Reading going forward.  Enjoy!
