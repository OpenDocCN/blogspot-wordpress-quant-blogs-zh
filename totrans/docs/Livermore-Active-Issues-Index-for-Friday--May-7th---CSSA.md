Rough week for the Livermore this week. (Both the NDX and OEX version… I’m a subscriber.) Do you think that during strong, extended rallies (like we’ve had over the past few months), the index becomes “polluted” with high-beta names. In other words, as I understand it, the goal of the index is to identify the strongest and most trending stocks in order to generate alpha. In a choppy or down-trending market, this may work as expected. But perhaps after a strong many-month rally, those names which appear to be the strongest are simply those with the highest beta, and will actually become the weakest if the market flips?

Interested to hear your thoughts on this. I’ve read your posts on rotation and beta-surfing, so this effect may be intended… Not sure how to think about it myself.
