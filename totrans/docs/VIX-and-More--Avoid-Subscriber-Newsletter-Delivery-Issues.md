# VIX and More: Avoid Subscriber Newsletter Delivery Issues

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/04/avoid-subscriber-newsletter-delivery.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/04/avoid-subscriber-newsletter-delivery.html#0001-01-01)

First, a quick thanks to all who have signed up for the [subscriber newsletter](http://vixandmoresubscriber.blogspot.com/). I have been quite pleased by the response to date.

Unfortunately, at least one subscriber has had trouble receiving the newsletter. If any other subscriber has failed to receive an issue on any Wednesday or Sunday evening Pacific Time, please drop me a note.

To be on the safe side, all subscribers are encouraged to add [bill.luby@gmail.com](mailto:bill.luby@gmail.com) to their email program's "approved senders list" to ensure that future issues do not end up in a spam or bulk mail folder.
