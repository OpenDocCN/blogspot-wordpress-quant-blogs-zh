# FingersCrossedHandler | Tales from a Trading Desk

## FingersCrossedHandler

Oleg over on ZeroTurnaround offers an interesting read on log file generation based on an interesting logger in Python [LogBook](http://pythonhosted.org/Logbook/api/handlers.html#logbook.FingersCrossedHandler) – Attack of the logs! Consider building a smarter log [handler](http://zeroturnaround.com/rebellabs/attack-of-the-logs-consider-building-a-smarter-log-handler/), and an example opportunistic-logger [code](https://github.com/shelajev/opportunistic-logger) base on github.  Curious if anyone has run something similar for a trading application in production – the financial committee is sometimes a little OTT on logging.
