## Book: Measure What Matters

Following the success at Intel , OKR’s are becoming increasing common in the wider software industry.  The bible has to be John Doerr book, [Measure What Matters](https://www.whatmatters.com/).  Notes from a read of the book over the vacation period:

*   Page 54 -Key results should be succinct, specific and measurable
*   Page 120 – OKR scoring based on a simple RAG status – 0.7-1 Green, 0.4-0.6 Amber, 0.0-0.3 Red.   Averaging the percentage completion rates for its associated key results.  Marry with subjective judgement.
*   Page 175 – OKRs and CFRs.  Annual performance reviews are costly, exhausting and mostly futile.
*   Page 186 – Recognition implementation ideas – all hands includes shout outs, “Achievement of the month”, share recognition stories, tie to company goals and strategy
*   Page 191 – Adobe “Check-ins”
*   Page 246 – [Khan Lab School](https://www.whatmatters.com/stories/okrs-for-students)
*   Page 257 – Committed vs Aspirational OKRs
*   Page 262 – Post mortem on failing to achieve 1.0 on a committed OKR
*   Page 267 – Typical OKR Cycle
*   Page 270 – Manager-led coaching – what part of the job most excites you, what (if any) aspect of your role would you like to change
