# Humble Student of the Markets: Correction ahead: Momentum is dying

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2019/03/correction-ahead-momentum-is-dying.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2019/03/correction-ahead-momentum-is-dying.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models**

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post,

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The

**Trend Model**

is an asset allocation model which applies trend following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or contraction (bearish)?"

My inner trader uses a

**trading model**

, which is a blend of price momentum (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa). Subscribers receive real-time alerts of model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of the those email alerts are updated weekly

. The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that began in March 2016 is shown below.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Sell equities*
*   Trend Model signal: Neutral*
*   Trading model: Bearish*

**Momentum is dying**

I have been cautious on the near-term equity market outlook for several weeks (see

[Here comes the growth scare](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2019/02/10/here-comes-the-growth-scare/)

and

[Still bullish, but time to reduce risk](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2019/02/24/still-bullish-but-time-to-reduce-risk/)

). I reiterate my point for being bullish and bearish over different time frames. While I believe stock prices will be higher by year-end, investors should be prepared for some turbulence over the next few months.

We are now seeing definitive technical evidence of a softer market in the near-term. Momentum is dying, and across a variety of dimensions. One key technique that I use to monitor momentum is the behavior of different moving averages. If the shorter moving average starts to roll over while the longer moving average continues to rise, that's a sign of fading price momentum.

The chart below depicts the weekly S&P 500 chart, with a MACD histogram on the bottom panel. Note how MACD, while still strongly positive, is starting to roll over. I find that the weekly chart is useful for intermediate term price moves while filtering out the noise from daily fluctuations.

In the past, such episodes have resolved themselves with either a sideways consolidation or market downdraft. I expect that the most likely outcome is a correction that will last 1-3 months, followed by a resumption of the bull market.
