# Humble Student of the Markets: Higher for longer

**Mid-week market update**

: The Fed has spoken. As expected, it hike interest rates 75 bps. In its Summary of Economy Projections (SEP), it sharply lowered GDP growth for this year and it raised the Fed Funds projection to 4.4% for this year and 4.6% next year, which are both ahead of market expectations. In other words, higher for longer (though it did signal rate cuts in 2024).

Fed Funds futures reacted by extending the already elevated Funds Funds rates for next year, but it did show some skepticism of the Fed's SEP by expecting rate cuts by September 2023.
