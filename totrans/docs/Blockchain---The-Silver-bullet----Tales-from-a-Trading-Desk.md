## Blockchain – The Silver bullet?

Although a few months old, this [posting](http://www.multichain.com/blog/2015/11/avoiding-pointless-blockchain-project/) from  Gideon Greenspan over on MultiChain which I previously linked to on the usual social networks, offers some good direction on why blockchain possibly isn’t the solution for every project going forwards.

The rules for a project to use blockchain:

1.  Database
2.  Multiple writers
3.  Absence of (writer) trust
4.  Disintermediation
5.  Transaction interaction
6.  Set the rules
7.  Pick your validators
8.  Back your assets

Or maybe in summary, a shared database distributed over nodes accessed by  multiple non-trusting writers who’s transactions interaction, that are independently verified and processed by every node, constrained by a set of rules held on each node, and validated by a consensus scheme, backed by an appropriate body.

that can modified directly
