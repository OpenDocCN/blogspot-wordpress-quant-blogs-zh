# Humble Student of the Markets: A buying opportunity for Chinese stocks?

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2019/01/a-buying-opportunity-for-chinese-stocks.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2019/01/a-buying-opportunity-for-chinese-stocks.html#0001-01-01)

I had a number of bullish comments on China in the wake of my last post (see

[How worried should you be about China?](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2019/01/27/how-worried-should-you-be-about-china/)

).

[Jeroen Blokland](https://twitter.com/jsblokland/status/1089806214286983168)

pointed out that the market is discounting a lot of weakness in the Chinese economy.

On the other hand, Caterpillar shares cratered today on jitters of a China slowdown. This brings up the question, "Are Chinese stocks a contrarian buy opportunity?"

**A Special Announcement**

We told you so. We told you the market was going down.

Here is the track of

***Humble Student of the Markets***

, where we are neither perma-bulls nor perma-bears. Most recently, we have been correctly bullish since the correction of 2015, and turned cautious in August 2018 (see

[Market top ahead? My inner investor turns cautious,](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2018/08/05/major-top-ahead-my-inner-investor-turns-cautious/)

August 5, 2018).

We were also timely at the 2009 bottom. We issued a call to buy beaten up low-priced stocks with high insider buying a week before the ultimate bottom (see

[Phoenix rising?](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2009/02/phoenix-rising.html)

 February 24, 2009).

***The out-of-sample record of our model trading portfolio in 2018 was up 42.9%***
