Our readers in New York may be interested in

[this finance workshop](http://www.cap.columbia.edu/announcements/CAP_Workshop_10/index.html)

at Columbia University tomorrow.

I am particularly interested in the talk by Kent Daniel on "Characterizing Momentum", and by Doug Borden (of Knight Equity Markets) on "Stochastic Control Theory in High-Frequency Trading". Doug's talk can be downloaded
