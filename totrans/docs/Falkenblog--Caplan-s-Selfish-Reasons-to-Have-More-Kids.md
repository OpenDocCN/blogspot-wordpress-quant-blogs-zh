# Falkenblog: Caplan's Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids

Back in 2008 when I was blogging under a pseudonym at Mahanolobis, I posted on the birth of my girl Izzie under the title

[Increasing my Carbon Footprint.](http://mahalanobis.twoday.net/stories/3766166/)

I mentioned this was all due to a 2005 blog post,

[The Selfish Reason to Have More Kids,](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2005/01/the_selfish_rea.html)

by Bryan Caplan, which he turned into a

[book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/046501867X/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=wwwviolentkicom&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=046501867X)

of the same name. Of course, while it might have been a necessary condition so were many other variables, so I don't want to oversell this, but he made a compelling point (I discussed this in an

[earlier post](http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2008/04/why-have-children.html)

). My wife admits she was quite content (overwhelmed?) with two children, I persisted, and she's now infinitely grateful. I just got the book last Friday, and its cheap, good, quick read. Maybe it will change your life!
