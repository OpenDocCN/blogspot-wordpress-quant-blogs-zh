## Traders, Guns & Money

### April 3, 2007

I’m about 80 pages in to Satyajit Das’ [Traders, Guns & Money](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Traders-Guns-Money-Unknowns-Derivatives/dp/0273704745), and I’m really enjoying it. It’s up there with Liar’s Poker and FIASCO. A great mixture of [trading anecdotes](http://www.pearsoned.co.uk/Bookshop/article.asp?item=903) and derivatives history it gives a good feel of how ruthless, outrageous, funny, degenerate, exciting and remunerative the industry can be.
