# Humble Student of the Markets: Buy RIMM/Sell NOK

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2012/11/buy-rimmsell-nok.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2012/11/buy-rimmsell-nok.html#0001-01-01)

In a recent meeting, a colleague who is a Blackberry fan remarked that the trade to put on is to buy RIMM and short AAPL, largely on the basis of positive buzz about the newest device, the Blackberry 10\. At that point, I shuddered. Putting on such a trade has two implicit bets:

1.  Apple (AAPL) is losing its franchise and competitive edge
2.  RIMM's Blackberry 10 will be a big winner

While AAPL's stock price has been deflating lately, talk that it is losing its competitive edge may be premature. To double down and then bet on the Blackberry 10 is like putting your money down on a long-shot exacta at the track - a risky proposition.

To be sure, this pair trade has shown a positive reversal and it does show recent positive momentum in favor of RIMM. The pair has been in a long relative downtrend as AAPL has outperformed RIMM for over five years. If you were to look at this chart, how confident are you further upside?

**A more risk controlled pair**

I suggested to my colleague that a better risk-controlled pair trade would be to buy RIMM and sell NOK. Both are perceived to be failing brands among wireless device makers, though RIMM is exhibiting positive momentum.

The pair is in a relative uptrend in RIMM's favor and there is more potential upside.

**Warning**

: This is not a high conviction idea for me, but if someone wanted to speculate on the Blackberry 10, this is probably a better and more risk-controlled way to make that bet.
