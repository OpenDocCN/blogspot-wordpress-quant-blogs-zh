# MiFID II – Clock Synchronisation | Tales from a Trading Desk

## MiFID II – Clock Synchronisation

LMAX blog has a [great](https://www.lmax.com/blog/staff-blogs/2015/11/27/solving-mifid-ii-clock-synchronisation-minimum-spend-part-1/) read on Precision Time Protocol (PTP).  Sensibly LMAX already had “GPS satellite antennae on the roof of some of our data centres” – very wise.  Interesting to see InfluxDB and Puppet are [used](http://catach.blogspot.co.uk/2015/11/solving-mifid-ii-clock-synchronisation_28.html).  Precision Time Protocol, like log files, and entitlements are often left until to late in a project.  If your involved in MiFID or distributed system, there blog postings are a must read.
