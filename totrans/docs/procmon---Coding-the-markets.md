## procmon

### November 9, 2013

I’ve long been a fan of Mark Russinovich’s sysinternals utilities, especially procmon and procexp. Today I discovered that in procmon, when browsing filtered file system events, you can get a stack trace by right clicking on the event. Wow!  I didn’t know that. Very powerful diagnostic technique.
