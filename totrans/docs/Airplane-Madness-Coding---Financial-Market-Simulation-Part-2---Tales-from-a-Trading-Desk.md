## Airplane Madness Coding – Financial Market Simulation Part 2

[Vanilla](http://vanillajava.blogspot.co.uk/) Java’s “Writing and Testing High Frequency [Trading](http://vanillajava.blogspot.co.uk/2013/09/writing-and-testing-high-frequency.html) Engines talk at JavaOne” may offer at some point in the future for my mad simulator to leverage some of the [OpenHFT](https://github.com/OpenHFT) code.  TransFIX, once the github repo started to get populated is of particular interest.  I’ve partially cheated on the messaging I’m using in the simulator today, but [chronicle](https://github.com/OpenHFT/Java-Chronicle) will probably be useful later as well.

Peter’s JavaOne presentation is available [here](http://www.slideshare.net/PeterLawrey/writing-and-testing-high-frequency-trading-engines-in-java#!).
