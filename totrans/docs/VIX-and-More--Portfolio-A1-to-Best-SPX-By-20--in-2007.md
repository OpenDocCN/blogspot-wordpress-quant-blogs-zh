# VIX and More: Portfolio A1 to Best SPX By 20% in 2007

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/12/portfolio-a1-to-best-spx-by-20-in-2007.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/12/portfolio-a1-to-best-spx-by-20-in-2007.html#0001-01-01)

On the heels of a strong fourth quarter, it looks as if Portfolio A1 will finish 2007 with at least a 20% advantage over the benchmark S&P 500 index since the portfolio’s February 16^(th) inception.  With one trading day left in the year, Portfolio A1 has a 23.4% gain, a full 21.8% better than the 1.6% gain in the SPX during this period.

I will publish some additional statistics once 2007 is in the books, but suffice it to say with the likes of [MOS](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=mos), [DRYS](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=drys), [TEX](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=tex), [PBR](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=pbr), [RIO](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=rio) and others in the portfolio over the past 10 ½ months, we have been fishing in very rich waters.

In addition to the usual equity curve and summary information, I have added a list of positions that were closed out during the year.

There no changes to the portfolio this week.

A snapshot of the portfolio is as follows:
