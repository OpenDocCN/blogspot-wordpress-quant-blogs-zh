## Adoption of the Open Web Platform

Thanks to a colleague pointing me at the W3C August 2013 [Highlights](http://www.w3.org/2013/08/w3c-highlights/).  Mobile and [native](http://www.w3.org/wiki/Closing_the_gap_with_native) continue to be topic of conversation in many quarters ([performance](http://www.w3.org/2012/11/performance-workshop/)).

> The Open Web Platform is now widely recognized as the premiere solution for cross-device and cross-platform development. To fulfill this promise, however, W3C must promote strong interoperability (through testing), high performance, stability (especially for consumer electronics), and a comparable or superior experience to native apps
