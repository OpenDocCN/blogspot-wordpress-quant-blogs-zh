# VIX and More: It’s the Oil, Stupid

When it comes to volatility, there are few catalysts that can spook the market like the prospect of an oil shortage.  With today’s announcement that crude oil inventories fell 8.8 million barrels when analysts were expecting a slight increase in inventory levels, the markets reacted sharply, with crude futures immediately spiking almost $4 per barrel to over $133.  In spite of today’s jump, crude is still trading below the all-time high of $135.09 and has pulled back toward 130.  Still, 135 will be an important resistance level to watch going forward.  If 135 holds, volatility should be contained; if it is breached, expect equities to face and volatility to surge with crude prices.

One more thing: tomorrow is the last trading day before the official beginning of the Atlantic [hurricane](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/hurricanes) season…
