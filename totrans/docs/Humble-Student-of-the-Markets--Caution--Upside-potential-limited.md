# Humble Student of the Markets: Caution: Upside potential limited

**Mid-week market update**

: Even as the bears were all lined up to push prices down last Friday, the bulls managed to make a goal-line stand and retain control of the tape. The index is tracing out a triangle pattern and testing resistance, while exhibiting negative RSI divergences.

In addition, other cautionary signs can be found elsewhere. While I would not necessarily discount an upside breakout to further fresh highs, current conditions argue for limited upside potential.
