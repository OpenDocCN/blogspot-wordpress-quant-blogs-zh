# Timely Portfolio: ISO Popularity on Flickr Explore

> 来源：[http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2013/10/iso-popularity-on-flickr-explore.html#0001-01-01](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2013/10/iso-popularity-on-flickr-explore.html#0001-01-01)

Not finance, but I figured there might be some out there interested in the pictures from [Flickr’s Explore](http://www.flickr.com/explore).  In addition to amazing photography, there is an abundance of information.  In the short post below, I use R with rCharts, slidify, and Rflickr to take a look at the distribution of ISO speeds over the last 3 days' of pictures.
