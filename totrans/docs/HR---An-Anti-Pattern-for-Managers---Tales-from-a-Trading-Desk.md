## HR – An Anti-Pattern for Managers

When the Netflix [Culture](http://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664) deck hit the web some long time period ago it generated some good conversation.  Although I never wrote anything about it at the time, other than [posting](https://hbr.org/2014/01/how-netflix-reinvented-hr) the link, I found the deck most interesting for the conversations it generated:

*   “Hire, Reward, and Tolerate Only Fully Formed Adults” – a great comment from [HBR](https://hbr.org/2014/01/how-netflix-reinvented-hr).
*   “During 30 years in business I’ve never seen an HR initiative that improved morale”
*   “We had no vesting period—the options could be cashed in immediately”
*   Some great call-outs [here](https://blog.slideshare.net/2014/06/11/inside-the-netflix-culture-deck/) and [here](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/27/netflix-culture-deck-success_n_6763716.html).
*   “Outstanding” employees [only](http://www.businessinsider.com/netflixs-management-and-culture-presentation-2013-2?op=1&IR=T). Netflix doesn’t accept anyone who does an “adequate” job (Hastings says those hires often lead to “generous severance packages”).
*   “Freedom and responsibility” vs command-and-control: Employees get to make decisions; managers just give them the right context to do so.
*   No “brilliant jerks.” It doesn’t matter how good you are at the job. If you’re a jerk, you won’t stick around Netflix for long.

Which leads me to the following thought:

> Are HR departments an anti-pattern for managers actually being managers.
