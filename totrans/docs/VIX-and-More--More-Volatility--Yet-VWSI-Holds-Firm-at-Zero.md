# VIX and More: More Volatility, Yet VWSI Holds Firm at Zero

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/07/more-volatility-yet-vwsi-holds-firm-at.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/07/more-volatility-yet-vwsi-holds-firm-at.html#0001-01-01)

For the second week in a row, we have seen a significant uptick in volatility, yet the VWSI refuses to move from zero.

The VIX ended last week at 16.23, up 0.48 or 3.0% for the week to its highest weekly close in 3 ½ months.  Looking back two weeks, the VIX has now risen a cumulative 2.29 points or 16.4%, with the VWSI holding steady at zero at the end of each week.

For what it’s worth, the [VIX futures](http://cfe.cboe.com/data/CFEMktStat.aspx) appear to agree with the assessment of the VWSI, as futures from July ’07 to June ’08 are all bunched tightly in the 16.16 to 16.41 range.

*(Note that in the above temperature gauge, the "bulli**sh" and "bearish" labels apply to the VIX, not to the broader markets, which are usually negatively correlated with the VIX.)*
