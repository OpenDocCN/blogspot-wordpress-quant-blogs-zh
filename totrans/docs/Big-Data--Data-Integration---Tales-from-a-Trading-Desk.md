## Big Data: Data Integration

Quanta Magazine has an interesting [article](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/quanta/20131009-the-future-fabric-of-data-analysis/) on data analysis.  “Data level” issues are often ignored from the buzz of Big Data discussions.  [Tika](http://tika.apache.org/) is at least heading in a direct to allow users to integrate data across 1,200 of the most common file formats.  The Newman’s group at Caltech sees “well-coordinated armies of intelligent agents (or actors)” as being important in the data sets processing of the future.  This should play well to [Typesafe](http://typesafe.com/platform/runtime/akka), the guardians of [akka](http://typesafe.com/platform/runtime/akka), and Microsoft’s [Orleans](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/orleans/) project
