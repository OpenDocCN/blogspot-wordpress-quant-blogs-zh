## Centre of Expertise Software Development: Shift¬†Left

Looks like ABN AMRO is [embracing](https://www.abnamro.com/en/careers/vacancies/it-internship-software-development-shift-left-amsterdam-11566i10-en_US.html) software quality üôÇ

‚Äú**Introduction**:Happy flow programming is easy, taking into account everything that can go wrong is difficult. There are many theories on how to properly take into account non-functional requirements such as maintainability, reliability in early stages of the software development life cycle. Shift left testing is an approach to software testing and system testing in which testing is performed earlier in the lifecycle (i.e., moved left on the project timeline). It is the first half of the maxim ‚ÄúTest early and often.‚Äú Why is it that transferring these theories into practice is so hard? What is it that more often than not a software engineer does not tackle what can go wrong earlier in the process? **Problem**:ABN AMRO has a long history in software development and certain processes and procedures have become habits. For instance validating quality at a very late stage, by having the bulk of tests in the acceptance environment. Although most stakeholders are aware of this and see the need to move a lot of this work to the development and test phases, the pace of adoption and practical implementations is still too low. **Research questions**:The main problem is the adoption of proper testing at development time. As a result, the main research question is:What are the best practices for shifting as many tests as possible to the development phase? Other underlying research questions might be:

How can the quality of Unit Tests be validated and improved?
How can performance tests be implemented in the development or test phase?
How can availability tests be implemented in the development or test phase?‚Äù
