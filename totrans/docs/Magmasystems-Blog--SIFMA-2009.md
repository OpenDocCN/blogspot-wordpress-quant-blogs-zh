# Magmasystems Blog: SIFMA 2009

Not much to write about

SIFMA

this year. I was warned by a friend that it was a ghost-town on the first day. I went to

SIFMA

on the second day, which is usually the most attended day, and unfortunately, my friend was correct.

In 2008,

SIFMA

has 350 vendors, but this year, they had 201 vendors, which is a

decrease

of about 42%. The side corridors used to be jammed with small vendors, but they were totally barren this year. Many large vendors were

conspicuously

absent, like

Sungard

and Reuters and Intel.

Cust

0

mer

traffic was way down, and in most booths, vendors were conversing with other vendors.

Sorry folks ... not much to write about here .....
