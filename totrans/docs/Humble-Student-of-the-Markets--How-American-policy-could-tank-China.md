As China approaches its 19th Party Congress, there has been no shortage of analysis about what to watch for. Here are a couple of examples worth reading:

*   Beijing's Game of Thrones: Signaling loyalty before the Party Congress ([China Focus](http://chinafocus.us/2017/09/11/beijings-game-of-thrones-signaling-loyalty-before-the-party-congress/))

Of particular importance is the

report that the Party plans to amend its constitution at the Party Congress as a sign that Xi Jinping is tightening his iron grip:

> China’s ruling Communist Party is expected to amend its constitution at a key party congress next month, state media said on Monday, in a sign that President Xi Jinping aims to enshrine his guiding ideological doctrine in the charter.
> 
> Since assuming office almost five years ago, Xi has rapidly consolidated power, with moves such as heading a group leading economic reform and appointing himself military commander-in-chief, although as head of the Central Military Commission he already controls the armed forces.
> 
> The Politburo, one of the party’s elite ruling bodies, deliberated a draft amendment to the constitution to be discussed at the congress that would include “major theoretical viewpoints and major strategic thought”, the official Xinhua news agency said.
