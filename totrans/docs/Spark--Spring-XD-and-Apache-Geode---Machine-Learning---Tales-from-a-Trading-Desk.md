## Spark, Spring XD and Apache Geode – Machine Learning

[Stock inference](https://github.com/Pivotal-Open-Source-Hub/StockInference-Spark) project over on Pivotal’s GitHub offer a nice starting point to machine learning with an interesting technology stack, which sensibly includes Spark 🙂  Not used Apache [Geode](http://geode.incubator.apache.org/) previously – the transaction support could be interesting within the low latency container.  Spring [XD](http://projects.spring.io/spring-xd/) offer a nice pipeline for aiding both real-time and batch processing of ingested data.  Interested to know if any readers have used Spring XD in earnest.
