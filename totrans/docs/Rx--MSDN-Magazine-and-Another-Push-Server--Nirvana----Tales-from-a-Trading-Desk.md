## Rx, MSDN Magazine and Another Push Server (Nirvana)

I see Channel9 has another Rx [video](http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/Going+Deep/Kim-Hamilton-and-Wes-Dyer-Inside-NET-Rx-and-IObservableIObserver-in-the-BCL-VS-2010/) worth watching.

MSDN Magazine August 2009 has a few articles worth reading:

Over the last few months I’ve blogged about Push Servers (COMET) – Lightstreamer and co. Unfortunately I appear to have forgotten [Nirvana](http://www.my-channels.com/). [my-Channels](http://www.my-channels.com/) homepage shows that CSFB, DB, Tullet and UBS use Nirvana. Nirvana even has a [Silverlight](http://www.my-channels.com/developers/nirvana/web/silverlight/) API 🙂 – demo [here](https://showcase.my-channels.com/demo/integration/tradespace/silverlight/).

DB Autobahn uses Nirvana – case study [here](http://www.my-channels.com/solutions/DBCaseStudy.pdf).
