[The International Traders Expo](http://www.moneyshow.com/tradeshow/las_vegas/traders_expo/?scode=029291)

is going to be at Caesar's Palace from November 14-17, 2012.

I've been to this expo a couple of other times and have really enjoyed it.  I'm pleased to announce I'll be back this year and giving a presentation on Saturday the 17th from 1:15pm - 2:15pm.

The topic of my presentation will be "Overnight Edges - A Quantitative Look at Overnight Market Movements and Opportunities".  I'll be covering a lot of my newest and most compelling research with regards to the overnight market.

I hope to get the opportunity to meet many readers and subscribers at the Expo.
