I stumbled across a fascinating

[lecture](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=febgutDYP7w)

on shame and guilt by

[June Tangney](http://psychology.gmu.edu/people/jtangney)

, a psychology professor at George Mason. I used to think they were the same, but she points out they are profoundly different.

She starts with a story about when she saw her little daughter kick her sibling, she wanted her daughter to feel bad. That is, though she loves her daughter, she wants her snowflake to feel bad sometimes, as it's a healthy corrective when one inevitably does bad things. The question is,

**how**

should you feel bad about yourself in such cases?

Guilt and shame are emotions not present at birth because they require a sense of self and standards; babies don't feel them. She defines shame as feeling bad about oneself, guilt feeling bad about behavior. Shame is feeling 'I am bad', guilt is feeling 'I did a bad thing.'  Both are painful, but guilt is not nearly as overwhelming.

 Guilt leads to thinking about behavior and its effect on others, shame is more focused on how others think about us. Shame attempts to hide and deny to escape the situation, even anger.  Guilt involves regret and remorse, and leads to a focus on reparation and redress. Guilt and other-oriented empathy go hand in hand, while shame interferes with empathy.

As a good scientist, she looks at data and finds people more prone to shame are not as mentally healthy as people prone to guilt. Further, people prone to shame blamed others more for their misfortune, classic defensive Freudian projection. Shame-proneness is more related to depression, anxiety disorders, low self-esteem, drug use, destructive behaviors, etc. Guilt proneness, in contrast, is associated with lower recidivism by convicts.  It doesn't seem to be inherited, as the correlation between parent and child in shame-proneness was a measly 0.1\.

She recommends guilt as the moral emotion of choice. Parents should minimize shame and humiliation, but rather to call children's attention to the harm that they've done, make redresses, and empathize with those they have hurt.  Guilt is much more constructive and proactive, and changing behavior is the key to improving one's situation.
