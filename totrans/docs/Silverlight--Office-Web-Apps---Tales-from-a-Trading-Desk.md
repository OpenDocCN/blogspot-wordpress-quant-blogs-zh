## Silverlight: Office Web Apps

Channel9 has (as usual) a [video](http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/dtzar/Office-Live-Applications-First-Look/) on [Office Web Apps](http://blogs.msdn.com/officewebapps/). The [Tech Preview](http://www.microsoft.com/office/2010/) (renders badly in Mac Safari) will be via [SkyDrive](http://skydrive.live.com/). What’s nice is that if you have the Silverlight plug-in installed, your get a better experience over and above the standard browser experience. Sharing edit changes in real-time is quite cool as well.
