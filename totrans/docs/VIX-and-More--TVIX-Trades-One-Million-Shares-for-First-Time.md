# VIX and More: TVIX Trades One Million Shares for First Time

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2011/04/tvix-trades-one-million-shares-for.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2011/04/tvix-trades-one-million-shares-for.html#0001-01-01)

Launched at the end of November 2010, the VelocityShares Daily 2x VIX Short-Term ETN ([TVIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TVIX)) has been the most popular of the volatility-based ETPs to hit the market in the past six months. Today TVIX hit a new milestone – barely halfway into the trading session – by surpassing one million shares for the first time.

Back in the middle of December, I [predicted](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/12/vix-and-more-and-2011-bespoke.html) TVIX “will hit a tipping point and become the darling of day traders” in 2011\. Frankly, I am a little surprised that it has taken more than five months to hit the one million share mark, but now that TVIX is adding liquidity, I would expect that day traders, hedge funds and other short-term trading operations will become much more active in this product.

Below is a snapshot of the intraday movement of TVIX taken from [Bloomberg for iPad](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Bloomberg%20for%20iPad).
