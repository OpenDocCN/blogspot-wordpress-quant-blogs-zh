# VIX and More: CBOE Rolls Out a New Blog; I Am a Guest Contributor

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2011/03/cboe-rolls-out-new-blog-i-am-guest.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2011/03/cboe-rolls-out-new-blog-i-am-guest.html#0001-01-01)

The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), the same people who brought you the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) and a host of other volatility products, recently joined the blogosphere with the launch of [What’s On Our Minds...](http://communities.cboe.com/t5/What-s-On-Our-Minds/bg-p/OfficialBlog)

For starters, the new blog is an excellent way to get inside the heads of the popular [instructors](http://www.cboe.com/learncenter/instructors.aspx) from [The Options Institute](http://www.cboe.com/learnCenter/OptionsInstitute1.aspx), which serves as the educational arm of the CBOE. Regular blog contributors from the Options Institute’s staff include Jim Bittman, Marty Kearney, Peter Lusk and Russell Rhoads.

In addition to the CBOE staff, What’s On Our Minds... draws upon the knowledge of a wide range of guest contributors, including familiar names such as Larry McMillan, Price Headley and Michael Thomsett. I will also be contributing to the CBOE blog from time to time. My initial contribution to the CBOE blog is titled [Volatility and Revolutions](http://communities.cboe.com/t5/What-s-On-Our-Minds/Volatility-and-Revolutions-by-Bill-Luby/ba-p/451). In it, I crunch the numbers on volatility during the Cuban Missile Crisis and in the wake of the Pearl Harbor attack and the (first) Gulf War. My conclusion?

> *“…geopolitical crises frequently fail to delivery market volatility that matches the extreme level of fear and anxiety being experienced by investors, diplomats and ordinary citizens.”*

If you are a VIXophile – or even if you are not – you should definitely add the CBOE blog to your daily reading list.
