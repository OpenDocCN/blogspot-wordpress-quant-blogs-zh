Curious if anyone has experience of leveraging [Service Landscape](http://bian.org/news-room/bian-in-the-news/bian-community-delivers-service-landscape-2-0-bringing-core-banking-interoperability-one-step-closer/).  I see SunGuard as a product company are using it, but I’m more interesting is bespoke development usage.  It’s also interesting to see the large US banks, are not [members](http://bian.org/membership/members/) of BIAN
