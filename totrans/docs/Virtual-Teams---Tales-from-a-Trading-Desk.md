## Virtual Teams

Slashdot [provided](http://ask.slashdot.org/story/15/03/15/2115244/ask-slashdot-what-can-distributed-software-development-teams-learn-from-floss) a few interesting links on Virtual Teams recently:

*   Why Remote Teams Are the [Future](http://www.helpscout.net/blog/virtual-teams/) (and How to Make Them Work)
*   Virtual [Success](http://sherimackey.com/2012/06/19/virtual-success-the-dark-side-of-virtual-teams/): The Dark Side of Virtual Teams
*   21 Months In: How to [Manage](https://zapier.com/blog/how-manage-remote-team/) a Remote Team

A few keys points are worth noting:

> hiring people you can trust, and conversely, trusting the people you hire

> Leaders that understand how to recognize and prepare for challenges and then raise solutions before they become costly stumbling blocks are setting themselves up for success. However, most leaders are taken aback by the diverse challenges that virtual teams can bring and spend the majority of their time attempting to assess what is going on and put out the fires.
