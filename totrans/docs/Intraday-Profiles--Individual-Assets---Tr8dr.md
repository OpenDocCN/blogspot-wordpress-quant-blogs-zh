I was expecting some differences in the profiles for differing equities.  Some of the factors that may provide differences:

1.  Liquidity
2.  Domestic or Foreign
3.  Institutional vs Individual Investor Holdings
4.  Industry?

I chose Apple (AAPL) and 2 other stocks at random with liquidity / trading volume declining from left to right { AAPL, ARO, CHT }.  Here are the Up Day charts for the high and low:

Of course looking at just one asset may not give a good read.   We may want to run on pools of stocks for a given liquidity and industry to give a better overall read.
