# Tim: “Lab49 are you listening?” | Tales from a Trading Desk

## Tim: “Lab49 are you listening?”

So a while ago Tim [blogged](http://blogs.msdn.com/tims/archive/2008/01/16/we-ve-released-the-news-reader-sdk.aspx) “Lab49 are you listening?” Given that Tim’s posting was on the topic of Microsoft’s recently announced [News Reader SDK](http://blogs.msdn.com/tims/archive/2008/01/16/we-ve-released-the-news-reader-sdk.aspx), I’m expecting to see quite a few [Lab49 WPF in Finance Innovation Contest](http://wpfcontest.lab49.com/) applications based on the SDK 🙂 – possilbe a sure way to win a [prize](http://wpfcontest.lab49.com/prizes.aspx)?

Further to Tim’s question, I’d actually counter with the question “Microsoft are you listening?” From where I sit in the [buy/sell side](http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/04/040204.asp) Microosft still doesn’t get finance. In my view Microsoft should do the follow:

*   Buy [Lightstreamer](http://www.lightstreamer.com/) and replace the server technology with .NET 🙂
*   Offer [panoption](http://www.panopticon.com/panopticon/) a substantial amount of money to build Silverlight versions of there visualization controls.
*   Consider engaging a company/individual 😉 to build an on-line financial trading and web-delivery platform that can be market’d to the finanial community.
*   To counter [BEA’s Event Server](http://www.bea.com/eventserver/), Microsoft should apply the same pattern to [NEsper](http://esper.codehaus.org/about/nesper/nesper.html) and offer a CEP engine – or even better build a [CEP](http://pointlessly.blogspot.com/2007/05/are-cep-guys-looking-at-linq.html) engine on [LINQ](http://oakleafblog.blogspot.com/2007/03/third-party-linq-providers.html).

Just my 2 cents 🙂
