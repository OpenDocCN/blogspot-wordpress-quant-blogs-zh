# Physics Perspective: Studies confirm: bankers are mostly non-human at the cellular level

> 来源：[http://physicsoffinance.blogspot.com/2011/10/studies-confirm-bankers-are-mostly-non.html#0001-01-01](http://physicsoffinance.blogspot.com/2011/10/studies-confirm-bankers-are-mostly-non.html#0001-01-01)

This is no joke. Studies show that if you examine the gene

tic material of your typical banker, you'll find that only about 10% of it takes human form. The other 90% is much more slimy and has been proven to be of bacterial origin. That's 9 genes out of 10: bankers are mostly bacteria. Especially Lloyd Blankfein. This is all based on detailed state-of-the-art genetic science, as you can read

[in this new article](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v465/n7300/full/465879a.html#/ref3)

in Nature.

OK, I am of course joking. The science shows that we're all like this, not only the bankers. Still, the title of this post is not false. It just leaves something out. Probably not unlike the sales documentation or presentations greasing the wheels of the infamous Goldman Sachs
