# Magmasystems Blog: Email notifications from OWA

When we are at a client's site, we need to use Outlook for Web Access (OWA) as the interface to the Finetix Exchange server. I am totally used to Yahoo Messenger's Taskbar-based notification mechanism for Yahoo Mail. Yesterday, I searched the web in hopes of finding a similar kind of Taskbar-based notifier for Exchange mail.

I finally found one. If you are tired of constantly checking your OWA mailbox for new email, then download this little ditty:

This will monitor your Exchange inbox and display a notification icon in the Windows Taskbar when new mail arrives.
