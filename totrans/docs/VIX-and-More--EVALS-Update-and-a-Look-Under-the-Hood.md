# VIX and More: EVALS Update and a Look Under the Hood

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2012/04/evals-update-and-look-under-hood.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2012/04/evals-update-and-look-under-hood.html#0001-01-01)

I have fielded so many questions about [EVALS](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EVALS) that I finally decided to put up a summary post that discusses various aspects of the mechanics of the EVALS model portfolio as well as some performance data. In [EVALS Q1 2012 Update](http://vixandmoreevals.blogspot.com/2012/04/evals-q1-2012-update.html), I address such issues as monthly returns, maximum drawdown, trading frequency, average holding period, correlation with the SPX, etc. for the first 4 ½ months since inception.

For those seeing more comprehensive information, [EVALS Relaunches, Now Focusing on VIX Exchange-Traded Products](http://vixandmoreevals.blogspot.com/2011/12/evals-relaunches-now-focusing-on-vix.html) might also be of interest. Readers who wish to see a graphic that explains the differences between the content in this blog, in the [newsletter](http://vixandmoresubscriber.blogspot.com/) and in EVALS are encouraged to review the content pyramid in [Five Years of VIX and More](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2012/01/five-years-of-vix-and-more.html).

Finally, in the event that anyone needs a more provocative teaser to visit the [EVALS blog](http://vixandmoreevals.blogspot.com/), I will disclose that there you will find some information relating to the 52.60% return in EVALS in the 4 ½ months since the November 17, 2011 launch.
