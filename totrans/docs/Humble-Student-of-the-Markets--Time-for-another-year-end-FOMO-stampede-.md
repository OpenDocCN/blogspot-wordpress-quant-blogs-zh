# Humble Student of the Markets: Time for another year-end FOMO stampede?

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2020/12/time-for-another-year-end-fomo-stampede.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2020/12/time-for-another-year-end-fomo-stampede.html#0001-01-01)

In late 2017, the stock market melted up in a FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) stampede as enthusiasm about the Trump tax cuts gripped investor psychology. The market corrected in early 2018 and rose steadily into October, though the advance could not be characterized as a melt-up. In late 2019, the market staged a similar FOMO stampede and the rally was halted by the news of the pandemic spreading around the world.

In each of the above cases, the [Fear & Greed Index](https://money.cnn.com/data/fear-and-greed/) followed a pattern of an initial high, a retreat, followed by a higher high either coincident or ahead of the ultimate stock market peak. 

Could we see a similar year-end melt-up in 2020?
