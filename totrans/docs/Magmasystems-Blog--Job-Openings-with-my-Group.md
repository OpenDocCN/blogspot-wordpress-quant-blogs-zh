# Magmasystems Blog: Job Openings with my Group

> 来源：[http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2009/02/job-openings-with-my-group.html#0001-01-01](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2009/02/job-openings-with-my-group.html#0001-01-01)

I have one full-time opening in my group, and possibly two consulting positions. The full-time job will be located on our Equities trading floor in the TriBeCa section of New York City. The consulting positions will be either in NY or in Jersey City.

For the full-time position, I am looking for a great .NET developer. The ideal candidate should be familiar with Team Foundation Server and issues around build and deployment. The candidate should also be familiar with WPF and WCF; we would ideally welcome someone who is proficient with one of the two and would be willing to become expert in the other.

For the consulting positions, I am looking for great .NET developers. WPF and WCF are highly desirable, as there will be definite UI work.

The consulting positions are on-site. Do not email me with requests to work remotely. They will be routed directly to /dev/null.

Because of the current fiscal environment, I cannot use external headhunters. Sorry.

You can send email to me at magmasystems at yahoo dot com.
