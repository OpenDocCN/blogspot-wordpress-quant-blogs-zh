# Quantitative Trading: Some riskless profit, and why it exists

> 来源：[http://epchan.blogspot.com/2008/10/some-riskless-profit-and-why-it-exists.html#0001-01-01](http://epchan.blogspot.com/2008/10/some-riskless-profit-and-why-it-exists.html#0001-01-01)

Numerous commentators have pointed out the enormous yield spread between agencies debt (Fannie

/Freddie) and US Treasuries.

Here are some links kindly provided by a reader:

[5 yr Fannie/Treasury](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=FNMGVN5:IND)

,

[10 yr Freddie/Treasury](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=FHMGVN10:IND)

, and

[5 yr Freddie/Treasury](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=FHMGVN5:IND)

.

Currently their spreads are above 150 bp. Since the US government has nationalized Fannie and Freddie, this 150 bp is a riskless profit. As the blog [Accrued Interest](http://accruedint.blogspot.com/2008/10/empire-doesnt-seen-leverage-as-any.html) has pointed out, one reason this riskless profit exists is hedge fund deleveraging: nobody has the risk appetite to arbitrage this spread at a meaningful scale.

[Brad Setser](http://blogs.cfr.org/setser/2008/10/25/one-easy-thing-china-could-do-to-help-stabilize-global-markets-buy-agencies/), a blogger at the Council of Foreign Relations, suggests that the Chinese government, who does have a lot of cash to benefit from this high yield, should go ahead and buy up these agencies debt. However, if you read the Chinese blogs and online comments, there is enormous internal pressure for the government to spend some of this money on infrastructure projects, social security, health care, etc., so I doubt that the Chinese government will have stabilizing the US mortgage market at the top of its agenda. As a result, arbitrageurs out there should have no fear that this opportunity will disappear any time soon.
