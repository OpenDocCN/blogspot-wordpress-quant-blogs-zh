## BAI Retail Delivery Conference – Silverlight

It would appear that [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2007/nov07/11-12BAI07MA.mspx) is [showcasing](http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/articleinvesting.aspx?view=PR&symbol=MSFT.O&storyID=148191+12-Nov-2007+PRN&type=qcna) a Silverlight retail banking application – “Based on Microsoft Silverlight technology, this demo will highlight the future online banking experience that is browser- and platform-independent, including enhanced functionality and unique visual appeal”. Anyone got any screen shots or a video of the demo?
