Effective tomorrow, December 10th, [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures) will be open for trading as of 8:20 a.m.

"Extended trading hours for VIX futures will give investors the ability to more efficiently mitigate risk and establish or offset positions that may be impacted by potential market-moving events such as overnight news, banking actions, or key economic reports released prior to the general market open," explained Andrew Lowenthal, Managing Director, CBOE Futures Exchange.

Of course VIX futures are the underlying security for all VIX options and exchange-traded products.
