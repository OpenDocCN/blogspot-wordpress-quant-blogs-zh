# VIX and More: Lowest Open for VIX Since 2/26/07

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/04/lowest-open-for-vix-since-22607.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/04/lowest-open-for-vix-since-22607.html#0001-01-01)

The VIX opened at 11.86 today, the first time it has opened below 12.00 since 2/26.

For those who may be interested, I will initiate a small long position in the VIX if it trades down to 11.16 at any point today. The VIX is currently trading at 11.52, a little bit above the 11.47 intra-day low.
