# Agile Fluency | Tales from a Trading Desk

## Agile Fluency

Old, but worth a [read](http://martinfowler.com/articles/agileFluency.html).  Specifically take aways:

*   Fluent one-star teams regularly report what they’re working on and how it’s progressing from a **business** **value** perspective
*   Fluent two-star teams **consistently** and **predictably** deliver value
*   Fluent three-star consistently and predictably deliver value
*   Fluent four-star teams contribute to **enterprise**-wide success.

Finally, check the “time to achieve” column at the bottom of the [article](http://martinfowler.com/articles/agileFluency.html), and the [video](http://vimeo.com/68327316).
