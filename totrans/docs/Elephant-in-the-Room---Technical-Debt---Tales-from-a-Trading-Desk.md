## Elephant in the Room – Technical Debt

Over the last few months there have been a few [interesting](http://www.infoworld.com/article/2878659/application-development/reducing-technical-debt-with-microservices.html) articles on [technical](http://www.infoq.com/articles/managing-technical-debt) [debt](http://www.infoq.com/minibooks/emag-technical-debt).  In my view, there are two items that need to be addressed around technical debt:

*   An understanding by both the team and stakeholders from day 1 of a project that technical debt will occur, and an agreement of how to rise it and have a sensible discussion without the classic blame culture associated
*   A backlog of technical debt that isn’t separated from the product backlog, and is prioritised appropriately from both an ROI and a team velocity – separation will essentially mean forgotten and ignored in my view
*   Who’s paying for [technical](http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/) debt?  Its unfortunate, but in many corporations, technical debt is a taboo word that can never be discussed, and must therefore be resolved by the team behind closed doors, in their own time.
