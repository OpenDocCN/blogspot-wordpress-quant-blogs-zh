# Humble Student of the Markets: How close are we to a recession?

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2018/06/how-close-are-we-to-recession.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2018/06/how-close-are-we-to-recession.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models**

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post,

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The

**Trend Model**

is an asset allocation model which applies trend following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or contraction (bearish)?"

My inner trader uses the trading component of the Trend Model to look for changes in the direction of the main Trend Model signal. A bullish Trend Model signal that gets less bullish is a trading "sell" signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading "buy" signal. The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. The turnover rate of the trading model is high, and it has varied between 150% to 200% per month.

.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Buy equities*
*   Trend Model signal: Neutral*
*   Trading model: Bearish*

**Dueling recession forecasts**

A minor scuffle erupted in the blogosphere last week. Fed watcher Tim Duy took issue with David Rosenberg's recession call with an article entitled "

[No, A Recession Is Not Likely In The Next Twelve Months. Why Do You Ask?](https://blogs.uoregon.edu/timduyfedwatch/2018/06/22/no-a-recession-is-not-likely-in-the-next-twelve-months-why-do-you-ask/)

". While Duy acknowledged that Fed policy is likely to be the trigger for the next recession, he disputed Rosenberg's contention that a recession is about to begin.

> I buy the story that the Fed is likely to have a large role in causing the next recession. Either via overtightening or failing to loosen quickly enough in response to a negative shock...
> 
> But the timeline here is wrong. And timing is everything when it comes to the recession call. Recessions don’t happen out of thin air. Data starts shifting ahead of a recession. Manufacturing activity sags. Housing starts tumble. Jobless claims start rising. You know the drill, and we are seeing any of it yet.
> 
> For a recession to start in the next twelve months, the data has to make a hard turn now. Maybe yesterday. And you would have to believe that turn would be happening in the midst of a substantial fiscal stimulus adding a tailwind to the economy through 2019\. I just don’t see it happening.

Duy does not believe that Fed policy is tight enough to cause a recession in the near future:

> As far as the Fed is concerned, I don’t think we are seeing evidence that policy is too tight. The flattening yield curve indicates policy is getting tighter, to be sure. But as far as recession calls are concerned, it’s inversion or nothing. And even inversion alone will not definitively do the trick. I think that if the Fed continues to hike rates or sends strong signals of future rate hikes after the yield curve inverts, then you go on recession watch.
> 
> With inflation still tame, however, the Fed may very well flatten the yield curve with two more hikes and then take a step back. To be sure, it will be hard to stand down or even reverse course on the yield curve alone. After all, the yield curve is a long leading indicator. It will be the outlying data. But there is a reasonable chance the Fed will not tempt fate in the absence of a very real inflationary threat.

Who is right? Tim Duy or David Rosenberg? In the past, every recession has been accompanied by a bear market.

Is a recession just around the corner?
