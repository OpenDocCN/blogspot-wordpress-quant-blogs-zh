## Digital Attack Map

A colleague pointed me at the Digital Attack Map [site](http://www.digitalattackmap.com/). 8th [August](http://www.digitalattackmap.com/#anim=1&color=0&country=ALL&time=15925&view=map) was clearly an interesting day, as was 27th [August](http://www.digitalattackmap.com/#anim=1&color=0&country=ALL&time=15944&view=map). Information on DDoS attacks is also provided [here](http://www.digitalattackmap.com/understanding-ddos/).
