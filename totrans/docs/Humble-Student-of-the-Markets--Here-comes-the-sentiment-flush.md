# Humble Student of the Markets: Here comes the sentiment flush

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2024/04/here-comes-sentiment-flush.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2024/04/here-comes-sentiment-flush.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models** 

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post, 

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The 

**Trend Asset Allocation Model**

 is an asset allocation model that applies trend-following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity prices. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. The performance and full details of a model portfolio based on the out-of-sample signals of the Trend Model can be found

[here](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/trend-model-report-card/)

.

My inner trader uses a **trading model**, which is a blend of price momentum (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa). Subscribers receive real-time alerts of model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of the email alerts is updated weekly [here](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/trading-track-record/). The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that began in March 2016 is shown below.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Buy equities (Last changed from “sell” on 28-Jul-2023)*
*   Trend Model signal: Bullish (Last changed from “neutral” on 28-Jul-2023)*
*   Trading model: Bearish (Last changed from “neutral” on 15-Mar-2024)*

#### Is the decline over?

Last week, I pointed out that the S&P 500 violated an uptrend that began in November. The violation resolved with the index is testing initial support at the 50 dma at about 5110\. Secondary support can be found at the upside gap in the wake of the last NVIDIA earnings report at roughly 5000 and strong support at the breakout level at about 4800.

The decline may not be done. The stochastic recycled from overbought to neutral, which is a tactical sell signal, but hasn’t quite yet reached an oversold level. I am inclined to look for an oversold reading before turning more constructive on stock prices after a major trend break.
