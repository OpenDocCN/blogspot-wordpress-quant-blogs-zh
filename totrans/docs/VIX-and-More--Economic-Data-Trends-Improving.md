# VIX and More: Economic Data Trends Improving

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/10/economic-data-trends-improving.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/10/economic-data-trends-improving.html#0001-01-01)

Those who were looking for some sort of unambiguously bullish number from this morning’s [ISM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/ISM) manufacturing survey may have been disappointed, but as the chart below shows, economic data relative to expectations have taken on a much more bullish tone since the end of August.  There was some evidence of a positive trend in the data when I last posted this chart on September 13^(th) in [Chart of the Week: Updated Economic Trend Data](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/09/chart-of-week-updated-economic-data.html). At that time, however, the trend was a weak one, leading me to conclude:

> *"While there is some evidence that the downtrend in economic data may have been broken, there is at best marginal evidence to support the idea of a bullish uptrend in the data."*

Since that time, there has been a notable uptick in the data – at least relative to consensus estimates – in manufacturing, housing/construction and in the consumer sector.

Of course until the increase in economic activity is reflected in the

[nonfarm payrolls reports](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/nonfarm%20payrolls)

next Friday or in subsequent months, any sort of ‘improvement’ is going to look more like treading water than genuine progress.

Also of note: next Friday is the final nonfarm payrolls report before the mid-term elections.
