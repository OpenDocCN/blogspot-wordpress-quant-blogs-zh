# Humble Student of the Markets: Could this FOMO surge be a mirage?

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2019/11/could-this-fomo-surge-be-mirage.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2019/11/could-this-fomo-surge-be-mirage.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models**

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post,

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The

**Trend Asset Allocation Model**

is an asset allocation model which applies trend following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or contraction (bearish)?"

My inner trader uses a

**trading model**

, which is a blend of price momentum (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa). Subscribers receive real-time alerts of model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of the those email alerts are updated weekly

. The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that began in March 2016 is shown below.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Buy equities*
*   Trend Model signal: Bullish*
*   Trading model: Bullish*

**New market highs**

Two weeks ago, I indicated that investors should buy the breakout (see

[Buy the breakout, recession risk limited](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2019/11/03/buy-the-breakout-recession-risk-limited/)

). I cited as bullish factors strong price momentum, low recession risk, evidence of a global cyclical recovery, and evidence of institutions and hedge funds caught offside with excessively defensive portfolios.

Since then, US equity indices have soared to all-time highs, and non-US markets have risen to new recovery highs. Seemingly overnight, all the bears seem to have capitulated and turned bullish.

While I remain bullish, good investors always examine their assumptions. What could derail this bull case?
