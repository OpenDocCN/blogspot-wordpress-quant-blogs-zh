# Humble Student of the Markets: How much business risk is hiding in your portfolio?

This is the second in an occasional series of posts on how to build a robust investment process. Part 1 was addressed to the individual investor and trader (see

[The ways your trading system could lead you astray](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2017/01/26/ways-trading-model-lead-astray/)

). This posts explores the issues that face the professional and institutional investor.

I had illustrated in the past why managers closet index. That`s because even a single misstep in an individual position could sink portfolio performance (see

[How Valeant revealed the dirty little secret of fund management](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2015/10/how-valeant-revealed-dirty-little.html)

). In this post, I would like to focus on how style and factor exposures affect business risk.

I recently came upon a study by

[Research Associates](https://www.researchaffiliates.com/en_us/publications/articles/549-how-not-to-get-fired-with-smart-beta-investing.html)

, which showed the tradeoffs between investment returns and business risk. The authors modeled a series of hypothetical portfolios with different styles, namely value, growth, momentum, quality, and random selection, which they called the "4 Orlandos", for the period 1967-2016\. As it turns out, the styles that showed the best performance also had the highest chance of getting a manager fired.

The termination criteria for a manager (which they called an "agent") is detailed below and roughly reflects the patience level of institutional sponsors:

> We select two highly stylized rules for a hypothetical investment board to use in evaluating the agent’s performance:

> 1) Fire the agent if more than 50% of funds selected by the agent underperform the benchmark in a given period.
> 2) Fire the agent if the equally weighted portfolio aggregated from the selected funds underperforms the benchmark by more than 1%.

In the light of these results, the big question for institutional investors is, "We all want good performance, but how far do you want to stick your neck out?"
