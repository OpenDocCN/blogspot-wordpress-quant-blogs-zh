# Humble Student of the Markets: Too early to buy gold and gold stocks

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2016/11/too-early-to-buy-gold-and-gold-stocks.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2016/11/too-early-to-buy-gold-and-gold-stocks.html#0001-01-01)

The stars seem to be aligning for a revival in gold prices. Prices saw a nice bounce today as equities weakened. The trends in other asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, and the US Dollar, look very stretched in the short-term and poised to reverse. From an inter-market analyst viewpoint, gold also seems to be in that camp.

The chart of gold below tells the story. Bullion prices have been falling and they are oversold on RSI-14\. The violation of key support at the 1205-1210 zone has prompted high volume selling, which is indicative of investor capitulation. From a technical perspective, gold prices are now testing a Fibonacci retracement level at 1170.

This seems to be a classic setup for a revival in gold prices. Not so fast! While gold prices may stage an oversold rally here, a durable bottom may not be in place just yet.
