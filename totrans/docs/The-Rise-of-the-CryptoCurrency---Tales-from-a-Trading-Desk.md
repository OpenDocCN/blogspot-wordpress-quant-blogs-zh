## The Rise of the CryptoCurrency

Bitcoin is about to make another [credibility](http://americasmarkets.usatoday.com/2015/05/19/nyse-launches-a-bitcoin-index/) step forwards with the recent announcement that the New York Stock Exchange will provide a NYSE [Bitcoin](http://tonyarcieri.com/the-death-of-bitcoin) Index (NYXBT) offering sight into the U.S. dollar value of one [bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin).  It will be interesting to see if NYXBT causes an uptick in interest around blockchain/bitcoin from software engineer in the finance vertical who have historical not had an interest in the peer-to-peer platform.

The main are of interest from my perspective is the algo trading opportunities.  There are a number of entry points to algo trading:

*   Custom build – Wild Bunny has a [two](http://www.wildbunny.co.uk/blog/2014/06/11/algorithmic-trading-with-bitcoin-part-1/) [part](http://www.wildbunny.co.uk/blog/2014/06/24/algorithmic-trading-with-bitcoin-part-2/) posting on algo trading using a few Chinese exchanges.  A few [bot’s](http://www.coindesk.com/how-to-trade-bitcoins-bot-software-sleep/) are listed [here](http://www.quora.com/What-is-the-simplest-way-to-get-started-with-algorithmic-Bitcoin-trading), including [ga-bitbot](https://code.google.com/p/ga-bitbot/).  Obviously your going to need historical bitcoin data, with one solution being [CryptoIQ](http://harris-on.typepad.com/cryptomarketsandtech/2015/04/cryptoiq-beta-testing-historical-pricing-service-for-algo-traders.html).  [XChange](https://github.com/timmolter/XChange) is a Java library providing a simple and consistent API for interacting with 30+ Bitcoin exchanges providing a consistent interface for trading and accessing market data.  [bitcoinj](https://bitcoinj.github.io/) is a Java library offering a wallet, send/receive transactions without needing a local copy of Bitcoin Core and has many other advanced features.  Of possibly most interest if you are a JavaScript developer, [bitcore](http://bitcore.io/).
*   Cloud platform – [tradewave](https://tradewave.net/) and [Cryptotrader](https://cryptotrader.org/).

Other reading that may aid – [blockchain programming](http://davidederosa.com/category/basic-blockchain-programming/).  Clearly the [blockchain](http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/techtank/posts/2015/01/13-blockchain-innovation-kaushal) is core, with Blockchain [explorer](https://blockchain.info/) offering some useful insight.
