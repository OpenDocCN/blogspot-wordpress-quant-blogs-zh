# Magmasystems Blog: Help Improve Resharper

> 来源：[http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2007/04/help-improve-resharper.html#0001-01-01](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2007/04/help-improve-resharper.html#0001-01-01)

Jetbrains is soliciting feedback and feature requests for their next version of Resharper. Fill out the questionaire

[here](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/quest.jsp)

Off the bat, I would like:

1) A way to tell Resharper to fix an entire file in one fell swoop, without having to navigate to each error or warning.... especially when resolving Redundant Qualifier warnings.

2) A way to Encapsulate all local variables in one fell swoop without having to navigate to each variable, right-clicking, and choosing Encapsulate Field.
