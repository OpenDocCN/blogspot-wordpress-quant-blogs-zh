# Humble Student of the Markets: Forget the Powell Put, what about a Trump Put?

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2018/12/forget-powell-put-what-about-trump-put.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2018/12/forget-powell-put-what-about-trump-put.html#0001-01-01)

I have been engaged in a running debate about the possibility of a Trump Put in the market. My friend believes that Trump is likely to pull back from a full-scale trade war with China, as it would tank the stock market and increase the likelihood of a recession. The Republicans lost the House in 2018 with the unemployment rate at 3.7%. A recession in 2019 or 2020 will not only lose them the White House, but probably both houses of Congress. Trump wants to avoid that scenario at all costs.

The

reported that Trump has been glued to the stock market and therefore highly sensitive to price gyrations:

> As the stock market churned this week, President Trump anxiously called advisers both inside and outside the White House looking to ensure that his talks with China were not driving the selloff.
> 
> Fresh off what he described as a historic weekend meeting with China’s President Xi Jinping, Mr. Trump has questioned why the markets weren’t reacting more positively to the news of the potential breakthrough with Beijing. In consulting with advisers, he remained convinced that the volatility wasn’t his own doing, but rather, the product of the Federal Reserve’s plan to raise the benchmark interest rate.

In short, the President's daily mood seems to be sensitive to stock prices:

> Wall Street analysts took note of the administration’s comments this week around the trade talks. Analysts at Morgan Stanley declared them indicative of the administration’s “markets-sensitive” approach to policy-making.
> 
> Nomura Securities said that it was yet “another indication that President Trump is sensitive to the market and economic disruptions that his trade policies can generate. That sensitivity may suggest that there are limits on how he will push those policies.”
> 
> Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, speaking at The Wall Street Journal CEO Council in Washington on Tuesday, said that “the (stock) market is now in a wait and see” moment with regard to China: “Is there going to be a real deal at the end of 90 days or not?”

Is there a Trump Put in stock prices? If the market were to really tank, could a Trump change of heart on China turn the market around?
