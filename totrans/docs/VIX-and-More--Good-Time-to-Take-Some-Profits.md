# VIX and More: Good Time to Take Some Profits

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/03/good-time-to-take-some-profits.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/03/good-time-to-take-some-profits.html#0001-01-01)

With the VIX at 13.52 and expiration coming tomorrow, this is a good time to take some profits on any remaining [fade the spike](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/fade%20the%20spike) trades.

Note that the lowest VIX close since [2/27](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/February%2027) is 13.99, so the risk/reward profile on any [mean reversion](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/mean%20reversion) trades continues to deteriorate with each click the VIX makes down.
