# VIX and More: Record Close for VIX: 80.06

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/10/record-close-for-vix-8006.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/10/record-close-for-vix-8006.html#0001-01-01)

With the VIX under 75 and only ten minutes left in the trading day, it looked like volatility was on the wane, but aggressive selling into the close dropped the DJIA 200 points and helped to push the VIX up over the 80 during the extra 15 minutes of index options trading.

This is the first time the VIX has closed over 80 and the 8th time in the past 16 trading days that the VIX has registered a new record close.
