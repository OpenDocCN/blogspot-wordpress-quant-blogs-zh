# Windows Sysinternals | Tales from a Trading Desk

> 来源：[https://mdavey.wordpress.com/2006/11/18/windows-sysinternals/#0001-01-01](https://mdavey.wordpress.com/2006/11/18/windows-sysinternals/#0001-01-01)

## Windows Sysinternals

Sysinternals is now available on [TechNet](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/default.mspx). Unfortunately it looks like the [Process Explorer](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/ProcessesAndThreads/ProcessExplorer.mspx) hasn’t been Vista enabled; check “Replace Task Manager”, close Process Explorer and Task Manager, and then bring up Task manager. If I do this on Vista RTM, I see “c:\windows\system32\taskmgr.exe The requested operation requires elevation.”
