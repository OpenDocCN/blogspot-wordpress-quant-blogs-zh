> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2019/01/a-rare-whats-my-credit-card-limit-buy.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2019/01/a-rare-whats-my-credit-card-limit-buy.html#0001-01-01)

The Zweig Breadth Thrust (ZBT) is a variant of the 

[IBD Follow-Through day](https://www.tradestation.com/education/labs/analysis-concepts/identifying-market-bottoms)

pattern, but on steroids. Steven Achelis at

[Metastock](http://www.metastock.com/Customer/Resources/TAAZ/?c=3&p=37)

explained the indicator this way [emphasis added]:

> A "Breadth Thrust" occurs when, during a 10-day period, the Breadth Thrust indicator rises from below 40% to above 61.5%. A "Thrust" indicates that the stock market has rapidly changed from an oversold condition to one of strength, but has not yet become overbought.
> 
> According to Dr. Zweig, ***there have only been fourteen Breadth Thrusts since 1945\. The average gain following these fourteen Thrusts was 24.6% in an average time-frame of eleven months*.** *Dr. Zweig also points out that most bull markets begin with a Breadth Thrust.*

*Monday's strong NYSE breadth has pushed the ZBT Indicator into buy signal territory. Call this a "what's the limit on my credit card" buy signal for investors, though not necessarily traders.*

 *Here is how the market has behave after ZBT buy signals. The full post can be found at our new site

**A Special Announcement**

We told you so. We told you the market was going down.

Here is the track of

***Humble Student of the Markets***

, where we are neither perma-bulls nor perma-bears. Most recently, we have been correctly bullish since the correction of 2015, and turned cautious in August 2018 (see

[Market top ahead? My inner investor turns cautious,](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2018/08/05/major-top-ahead-my-inner-investor-turns-cautious/)

August 5, 2018).

We were also timely at the 2009 bottom. We issued a call to buy beaten up low-priced stocks with high insider buying a week before the ultimate bottom (see

[Phoenix rising?](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2009/02/phoenix-rising.html)

 February 24, 2009).

***The out-of-sample record of our model trading portfolio in 2018 was up 42.9%***
