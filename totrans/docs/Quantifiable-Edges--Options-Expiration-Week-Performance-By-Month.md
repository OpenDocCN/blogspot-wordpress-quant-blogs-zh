# Quantifiable Edges: Options Expiration Week Performance By Month

> 来源：[http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2010/03/options-expiration-week-performance-by.html#0001-01-01](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2010/03/options-expiration-week-performance-by.html#0001-01-01)

Some readers may recall that I’ve previously labeled December op-ex week “

[The Most Wonderful Time of the Year](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2009/12/most-wonderful-tiiiiime-of-yearrrrrrr.html)

”. Op-ex week in general is normally pretty good. And while December has been the most reliable month, both March and April have produced more profits going back to 1984\. Below is a table that breaks down op-ex week performance by month. It assumes buying the close on the Friday prior to op-ex and selling the close of op-ex Friday. If there was a holiday on that Friday, then the Thursday before the weekend was bought. I excluded op-ex week of September 2001 due to the extreme (and horrific) circumstances.

This positive seasonality could provide a bit of a tailwind this week for the market.
