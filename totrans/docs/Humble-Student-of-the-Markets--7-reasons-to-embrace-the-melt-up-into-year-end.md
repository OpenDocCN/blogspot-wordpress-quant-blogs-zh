# Humble Student of the Markets: 7 reasons to embrace the melt-up into year-end

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2023/11/7-reasons-to-embrace-melt-up-into-year.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2023/11/7-reasons-to-embrace-melt-up-into-year.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models** 

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post, 

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The 

**Trend Asset Allocation Model**

 is an asset allocation model that applies trend-following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity prices. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. The performance and full details of a model portfolio based on the out-of-sample signals of the Trend Model can be found

[here](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/trend-model-report-card/)

.

My inner trader uses a 

**trading model**

, which is a blend of price momentum (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa). Subscribers receive real-time alerts of model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of the email alerts is updated weekly

. The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that began in March 2016 is shown below.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Buy equities (Last changed from “sell” on 28-Jul-2023)*
*   Trend Model signal: Bullish (Last changed from “neutral” on 28-Jul-2023)*
*   Trading model: Neutral (Last changed from “neutral” on 14-Nov-2023)*

** The performance chart and model readings have been delayed by a week out of respect to our paying subscribers.***Update schedule**

: I generally update model readings on my

 on weekends. I am also on X/Twitter at @humblestudent. Subscribers receive real-time alerts of trading model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of those email alerts is shown

#### A cup and handle breakout

Much has been made about a nascent cup and handle pattern in the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ 100, which would have strong bullish implications if either index were to stage upside breakouts. While investors wait for those breakouts, here is a cup and handle that has staged a definitive upside breakout on both an absolute basis and relative to the S&P 500\. It was made by the NYSE FANG+ Index, which represents megacap growth stocks.

In light of the strong price momentum exhibited by the stock market in the wake of the Zweig Breadth Thrust buy signal, I believe these are strong indications that investors and traders should embrace a market melt-up scenario into year-end and possibly beyond.
