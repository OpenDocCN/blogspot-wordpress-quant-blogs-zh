# Timely Portfolio: System from Trend Following Factors

> 来源：[http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2012/06/system-from-trend-following-factors.html#0001-01-01](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2012/06/system-from-trend-following-factors.html#0001-01-01)

As I thought more about [Trend Following Factors from Hsieh and Fung](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2012/05/trend-following-factors-from-hsieh-and.html), I thought that the trend following factors might indicate a state/regime for the equity markets that could potentially offer momentum-style timing signals for a system on the S&P 500.  Now, **THIS ABSOLUTELY SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED INVESTMENT ADVICE,** especially since the factor data is very lagged and the testing is nowhere near comprehensive enough.  I will however try to replicate the factor methodology to get a more real-time indicator extended to any index in another post. What is most interesting to me is that this is ex-ante intuitive and the signal is just basic statistics.

Comments have been very light. Please let me know your thoughts.
