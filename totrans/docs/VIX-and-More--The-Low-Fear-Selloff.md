# VIX and More: The Low Fear Selloff

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2011/12/low-fear-selloff.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2011/12/low-fear-selloff.html#0001-01-01)

Steven Place of [Investing with Options](http://www.investingwithoptions.com/) has a video post up this morning, [Options Market Does Not Care About Selloff](http://www.stumbleupon.com/su/6c9jSD/www.investingwithoptions.com/2011/12/12/options-market-does-not-care-about-selloff/), in which he discusses how the [implied volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/implied%20volatility) in various asset class volatility indices (VIX, [GVZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/GVZ), [EVZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EVZ)) are showing a very muted reaction to today’s selloff in stocks.

As noted here previously, the VIX generally moves about -4x in percentage terms the direction of the SPX. Mondays generally see a slightly larger move in the VIX relative to the SPX (usually an incremental 0.5% - 1.0% increase over Friday’s close) due to [calendar reversion](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/calendar%20reversion) or the weekend effect, so today one would expect to see the VIX moving at least 4x in the opposite direction of the SPX.

In fact, as I type this the SPX is down about 1.9% on the day and the VIX is up only 3.9% -- so the VIX is about half as sensitive to changes in the SPX that is typical for a Monday trading session.

This is not to say that investors are oblivious to the risk that remain in Europe (and elsewhere) or that today’s move is just a head fake by stocks, but it does mean that the consensus expectations for immediate downside risk are quite low.

Santa may pay a visit after all, assuming he manages to survive all the austerity measures that I am certain his government has saddled him with…
