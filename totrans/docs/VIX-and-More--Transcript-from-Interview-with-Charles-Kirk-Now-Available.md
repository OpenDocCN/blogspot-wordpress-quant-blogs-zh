> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/10/transcript-from-interview-with-charles.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/10/transcript-from-interview-with-charles.html#0001-01-01)

The complete transcript of my interview yesterday afternoon with Charles Kirk of [The Kirk Report](http://www.kirkreport.com/) is now available for viewing [here](http://kirkreport.com/tkr/sb4jd). We covered a great deal of ground in an hour (for better or for worse, I can type faster than I can think) and our conversation and reader questions spanned topics such as:

*   my trading history prior to becoming a full-time trader in 2005
*   some of my best and worst trades (I forgot to answer the part about lessons learned, but I will flesh that out on the blog)
*   some of the factors that have contributed to my development as a trader
*   how I approach trading now
*   the role of volatility in my trading
*   the value of combining volatility and volume
*   some thoughts on how a beginning trader might want to make use of the VIX
*   the value of [VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX) as a portfolio hedge
*   what my proprietary market sentiment indicator ([AMSI](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/AMSI)) is predicting right now
*   some of my favorite options resources
*   three “must read” posts on the blog, as well as my personal favorite

Thanks to all who participated. Some of the questions have given me ideas about subjects for future posts.

Finally, thanks to Charles Kirk for including me in his interview series. Charles is an invaluable trading resource for all of us, as well as an excellent interviewer.
