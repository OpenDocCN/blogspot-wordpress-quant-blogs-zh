## Lambda Architecture

The first architecture to really define how batch and [stream](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/data-streaming-nsq) processing can work [together](http://jameskinley.tumblr.com/post/37398560534/the-lambda-architecture-principles-for-architecting) to solve a myriad of use cases.  Also see this [presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/nathanmarz/runaway-complexity-in-big-data-and-a-plan-to-stop-it), specifically slide 121.
