Earlier this week, [OptionPundit](http://www.optionpundit.net/) published the transcript of a recent interview: [Bill Luby Talks to OptionPundit](http://www.optionpundit.net/interviews/bill-luby-talks-to-optionpundit).

The interview touches on a wide range of subject, but with an emphasis on the VIX and VIX-based ETPs, such as [VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX), [VXZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXZ), [XVIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XVIX). As always, [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures) and the VIX futures [term structure](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/term%20structure) are a critical part of this discussion.
