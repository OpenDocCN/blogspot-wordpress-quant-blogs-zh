# VIX and More: Another Record in VIX Call Volume

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2013/03/another-record-in-vix-call-volume.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2013/03/another-record-in-vix-call-volume.html#0001-01-01)

Exactly three weeks ago today, I thought I would break some news on an intraday basis with a post that I titled, [Record VIX Options Volume and Large Purchases of VIX Calls](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2013/02/record-vix-options-volume-and-large.html). As it turns out, by the time the day’s total volume was tallied, February 26^(th) turned out to be an all-time record for [VIX options](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20options) volume in general and [VIX calls](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20calls) in particular.

The events of three weeks ago now look a little less impressive in light of today’s new record in VIX call volume. Truth be told, VIX options seem to be attracting the attention of a new group of investors. In fact, during the [CBOE Risk Management Conference](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2013/03/some-thoughts-on-cboe-rmc.html) earlier this month, there was a great deal of speculation surrounding who some of the new players in the VIX space might be that are responsible for the new growth in [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures) and VIX options that appears to be independent of the volume driven by [VIX ETPs](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20ETN).  *[Hedge funds, proprietary trading firms, commodity trading pools/advisors, insurance companies, bond traders, FX traders and others were among the names that were bandied about…]*

As is typically the case with the VIX, call volume outpaced put volume by a substantial margin. Today the call to put ratio was about 2.2 to 1, slightly higher than the average of 1.9 to 1\. That being said, put buyers appeared to be a little more aggressive than call buyers, with 42% of all puts bought on the ask, as opposed to 30% of the calls, according to data provided by [LivevolPro](http://www.livevolpro.com/).

Investors are always looking for an interpretive overlay for these VIX options transactions. Frankly, on the day before the March VIX expiration, a great deal of the options activity is the result of large investors closing out March positions or attempting to game the special opening quotation ([VIX SOQ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20SOQ)) from tomorrow’s open that establishes the settlement price for VIX options and futures.  As a result of that low signal to noise ratio, the day prior to expiration is generally not a productive time for reading options entrails, though there will no doubt be some who are hell-bent on some sort of options divination regardless of where we are in the VIX expiration cycle.  For today at least, I would suggest that the links below might bear more fruit.
