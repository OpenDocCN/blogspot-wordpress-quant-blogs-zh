## UK Azure Community Meeting, MIX 09 and Silverlight¬†3

I‚Äôve just signed up for [this](http://msdnrss.thecoderblogs.com/2009/03/17/windows-azure-community-meeting-in-the-uk/) Microsoft meeting. I‚Äôm hoping James Conard might provide some insight into when I can get CloudTrader working in Azure üôÇ

You can get a high level overview of what is in Silverlight 3 [here](http://silverlight.net/getstarted/silverlight3/default.aspx). Silverlight 3 definately going to offer Adobe AIR some competition:

*The new out of browser experience in Silverlight 3 enables users to place their favorite Silverlight applications directly onto their PC and Mac, with links on the desktop and start menu‚Äîall without the need to download an additional runtime or browser plug-in. Further, the new experience enables Silverlight applications to work whether the computer is connected to the Internet or not‚Äîa radical improvement to the traditional Web experience. Features include:*

*   Life outside the browser. Silverlight applications can now be installed to and run from the desktop as lightweight web companions. Thus, users can take their favorite Web applications with them, regardless of whether they are connected to the Internet or not.
*   Desktop shortcuts and start menu support. Silverlight applications can be stored on any PC or Mac computer‚Äôs desktop with links in the start menu and applications folder, and so are available with one-click access.
*   Safe and secure. Leveraging the security features of the .NET Framework, Silverlight applications run inside a secure sandbox with persistent isolated storage. These applications have most of the same security restrictions as traditional web apps and so can be trusted without security warnings or prompts, minimizing user interruptions.
*   Smooth installation. Because Silverlight applications are stored in a local cache and do not require extra privileges to run, the installation process is quick and efficient.
*   Auto-update. Upon launch, Silverlight applications can check for new versions on the server, and automatically update if one is found.
*   Internet connectivity detection. Silverlight applications can now detect whether they have Internet connectivity and can react intelligently including caching a users‚Äô data until their connection is restored.

[MIX09](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/events/mix/imageGallery.aspx) keynote is worth [watching](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/events/mix/videoGallery.aspx) especially the last 10 mins ‚Äì Blend 3 appears to have the Adobe Thermo feel to it.
