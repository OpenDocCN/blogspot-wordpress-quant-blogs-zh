I have a HP

dv

9700t laptop that I bought about a year and a half ago, and it has developed the hinge-crack problem. However, HP has not identified this notebook as being one of the models that have this problem (although practically every other HP

Pavillion

laptop has this problem). Therefore, after my call to HP tech support, they have refused to cover my laptop under their free-repair agreement.

When you call HP tech support, you are routed to a non-HP call center in Canada. Their job is to be the "gatekeepers" to the HP Case Managers, who are the people who determine whether your notebook should be repaired for non charge. After speaking to two levels of people at the call center, they have finally referred my problem to an HP case manager. They told me to expect a call anywhere from 24 to 72 hours.

I will let you know what happens.

HP Servers are used everywhere on Wall Street. It's amazing that HP has not been upfront about this major problem. The

website has been very instructional in how widespread this problem is.

If you are in the market for a new laptop, I urge you to browse this website and know what you may be getting yourself into.
