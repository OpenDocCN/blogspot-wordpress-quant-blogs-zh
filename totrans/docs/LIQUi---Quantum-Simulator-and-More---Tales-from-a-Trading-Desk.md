## LIQUi|> Quantum Simulator and More

[Microsoft](http://fortune.com/2015/11/13/microsoft-quantum-computing-simulator/) [Research](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/liquid/) has [released](http://blogs.microsoft.com/next/2015/11/13/with-quantum-computing-simulator-microsoft-offers-a-sneak-peek-into-future-of-computing/) LIQUi|> on [github](https://github.com/msr-quarc/liquid) that offers:

> LIQUi|> is a software architecture and toolsuite for quantum computing. It is currently being developed and will include programming languages, optimization and scheduling algorithms, and quantum simulators. Ultimately, LIQUi|> will be used to translate a quantum algorithm written in the form of a high-level program into the low-level machine instructions for a quantum device.

Only downside is that its Windows based, so if your on OSX, you need a VM 😦
