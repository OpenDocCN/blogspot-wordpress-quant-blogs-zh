# VIX and More: Chart of the Week Contest Reminder

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/06/chart-of-week-contest-reminder.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/06/chart-of-week-contest-reminder.html#0001-01-01)

Well, it certainly has been an interesting trading week.

Since most of you will spend part of the weekend reviewing your own charts and seeking out some of the best of what others have to offer, let this be a reminder that I will be accepting entries in the [chart of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week) contest through Sunday at 6:00 p.m. PT.

As noted previously, in addition to anointing the winner as official *VIX and More* chart of the week, I will also award a free one year subscription to [*Expiring Monthly: The Option Traders Journal*](http://www.expiringmonthly.com/) to the winner.

Readers can submit a chart of the week entry in the comments section of this post or by emailing me directly at bill.luby[at]gmail.com.
