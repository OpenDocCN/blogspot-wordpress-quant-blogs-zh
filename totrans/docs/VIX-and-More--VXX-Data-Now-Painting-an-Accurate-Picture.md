# VIX and More: VXX Data Now Painting an Accurate Picture

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/03/vxx-data-now-painting-accurate-picture.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/03/vxx-data-now-painting-accurate-picture.html#0001-01-01)

Just one week ago, I posted an earlier version of the graphic below in [VXX Juice Factor and Portfolio Insurance Implications](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/02/vxx-juice-factor-and-portfolio.html). In that article, I explained how daily percentage price changes in VXX (what I call the [VXX juice factor](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX%20juice%20factor)) had been running at the rate of about 70% of the changes in the VIX. This was in sharp contrast to the 35-40% my modeling of historical data had led me to expect when I published [VXX Tracking VIX at 80+% Today](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/02/vxx-tracking-vix-at-80-today.html) the previous week.

Now, after 22 days of trading, the actual data for [VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX) have converged with my model and expectations.

Here is a quick summary of the first 22 days, with some takeaways that should prove to be helpful going forward:

*   The median one day percentage change in VXX has been approximately 35% of the change in the VIX
*   77% of the time the two volatility measures have moved in the same direction (with divergences limited to days in which the percentage changes were small)
*   14% of the time VXX made a sharper move than the VIX (again, only on days with relatively small changes)
*   On the three days the SPX has dropped more than 4%, VXX has moved 37%, 52% and 76% as much as the VIX, for an average of 55%

I expect these numbers, particularly the 35% and 55% ones, to come very close to matching the long-term performance of VXX relative to the VIX.
