# Quantifiable Edges: Friday Was Another Low Volume Rally

> 来源：[http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2008/11/friday-was-another-low-volume-rally.html#0001-01-01](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2008/11/friday-was-another-low-volume-rally.html#0001-01-01)

The market rallied nicely on Friday but volume came in quite a bit below the previous few days. Strong up days on low volume have been creamed lately. A few recent examples would include 9/30, 10/13, 10/20, and 11/4\. The table below shows results following all one-day gains of 2.5% or more that were accompanied by volume under the 10-day average.
