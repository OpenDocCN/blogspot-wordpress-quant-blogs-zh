# Humble Student of the Markets: Peak FANG?

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2017/10/peak-fang.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2017/10/peak-fang.html#0001-01-01)

I had been meaning to write about this topic, but

[Barron's](http://www.barrons.com/articles/breaking-up-tech-1508553556)

beat me to it with a terrific article called "Breaking up Tech" which detailed the anti-trust vulnerability of Big Tech companies. The Barron's article stands in direct contrast to a recent

post which postulated that investors are rushing into the technology sector as a hedge against the obsolescence of their own skill sets:

> A 45 year old married father of two with a mortgage and a pair of college educations to fund. The remote yet persistent threat of a nuclear war is not what keeps him up at night. In fact, he might almost see it as a relief should it come. He is a bundle of raw nerves, and each day brings even more dread and foreboding than the day before. What’s frying his nerves and impinging on his amygdala all day long is something far scarier, after all. He, like everyone else, is afraid that he doesn’t have a future.
> 
> He is petrified by the idea that the skills he’s managed to build throughout the course of his life are already obsolete...
> 
> We could be in the midst of the first fear-based investment bubble in American history, with the masses buying in not out of avarice, but from a mentality of abject terror. Robots, software and automation, owned by Capital, are notching new victories over Labor at an ever accelerating rate. It’s gone parabolic in recent years – every industry, every region of the country, and all over the world. It’s thrilling to be a part of if you’re an owner of the robots, the software and the automation. If you’re a part of the capital side of that equation.

> If you’re on the other side, however – the losing side – it’s a horror movie in slow motion.
> 
> The only way out? Invest in your own destruction. In this context, the FANG stocks are not a gimmick or a fad, they’re a f***ing life raft. Market commentators rhetorically ask aloud what multiple should investors pay to own the technology giants. That’s the wrong question when people feel like they’re drowning.

> *What multiple would you pay to survive? Grab a raft.*

Who is right?
