# Humble Student of the Markets: Why this AI bull is nothing like the NASDAQ in 2000

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2024/02/why-this-ai-bull-is-nothing-like-nasdaq.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2024/02/why-this-ai-bull-is-nothing-like-nasdaq.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models** 

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post, 

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The 

**Trend Asset Allocation Model**

 is an asset allocation model that applies trend-following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity prices. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. The performance and full details of a model portfolio based on the out-of-sample signals of the Trend Model can be found

[here](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/trend-model-report-card/)

.

My inner trader uses a 

**trading model**

, which is a blend of price momentum (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa). Subscribers receive real-time alerts of model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of the email alerts is updated weekly 

[here](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/trading-track-record/)

. The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that began in March 2016 is shown below.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Buy equities (Last changed from “sell” on 28-Jul-2023)*
*   Trend Model signal: Bullish (Last changed from “neutral” on 28-Jul-2023)*
*   Trading model: Neutral (Last changed from “bullish” on 24-Jan-2024)*

** The performance chart and model readings have been delayed by a week out of respect to our paying subscribers.***Update schedule**

: I generally update model readings on my 

[site](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/)

 on weekends. I am also on X/Twitter at @humblestudent. Subscribers receive real-time alerts of trading model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of those email alerts is shown

#### Priced to the point of insanity?

You may have seen the charts of the relative performance of the NASDAQ 100 to S&P 500\. The ratio has already exceeded the dot-com peak in 2000\. In addition, NYU professor Aswath Damodaran, who is regarded as the dean of company valuations, went on

[CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/02/06/all-of-the-mag-7-stocks-look-overpriced-says-nyus-aswath-damodaran.html)

to say that Nvidia is priced “to the point of insanity”, while the other Magnificent Seven stocks are roughly fairly priced.

While the latest AI-driven mania may seem stretched by historical standards, we would argue that it has a lot further to run before the AI bull is done.
