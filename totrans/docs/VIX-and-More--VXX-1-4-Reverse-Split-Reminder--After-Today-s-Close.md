# VIX and More: VXX 1-4 Reverse Split Reminder, After Today's Close

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/11/vxx-1-4-reverse-split-reminder-after.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/11/vxx-1-4-reverse-split-reminder-after.html#0001-01-01)

Just a quick reminder that everyone's favorite VIX ETN, [VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX), will undergo a 1-4 reverse split at the close of business today.  Of course the net value of any VXX positions will not be affected, as the split will merely change the units of the holdings in the ETN or in [VXX options](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX%20options).
