# Humble Student of the Markets: Encouraging action for bond bulls

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2011/09/encouraging-action-for-bond-bulls.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2011/09/encouraging-action-for-bond-bulls.html#0001-01-01)

Back on August 29, I wrote that it was

[not too late to buy the long bond](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2011/08/not-too-late-to-buy-long-bond.html)

and I remain relatively comfortable with that position, despite the likely volatility from the FOMC meeting this week.

For several weeks, traders have been frustrated as stocks and bonds appear to be stuck in a volatile news-driven range bound market.

While that may be true of stocks, the long bond yield fell to 3.19T yesterday, which is good news for bond bulls. The chart below shows the yield on 30-year Treasury, which is in a downtrend and staged a minor and unconfirmed downside breakout (upside price breakout).

While I recognize that the bond market rally may be in anticipation of the implementation of

[Operation Twist](http://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/letter/2011/el2011-13.html)

, this market action is nevertheless constructive for bond bulls. In addition, Maryann Bartels of BoA/Merrill Lynch reported that large speculators, which are mostly hedge funds, have a roughly neutral position in the T-Bond futures contract - indicating that the hedge fund/fast money doesn't seem to be positioned in anticipation of Operation Twist:

(Note that this data is a little dated from last Tuesday, September 13.) What's more surprising is that large speculators were near a crowded short in the 10-year note:

Bartels also reported that global macro hedge funds were net short the 10-year note, which is another indication that macro hedge funds are not frontrunning Operation Twist.

As well, Arthur Hill of stockcharts.com pointed out that industrial metals broke down through a technical support level yesterday, which is a signal of economic weakness - and another positive sign for bond prices.

**Looking ahead to the FOMC meeting**

While I am acutely aware of the event risk on Wednesday from the FOMC meeting, I agree with the analysis of

[Tim Duy﻿](http://economistsview.typepad.com/timduy/2011/09/rearranging-the-deck-chairs.html)

. Underlying his assumption is the Federal Reserve is

***an institution***

of economists, who are mostly academically inclined, and not just one person. While Chairman Bernanke's opinions no doubt carry a lot of sway, he is not king.

I believe that the most likely outcome is some form of extension of the average maturity of the Fed balance sheet, along with

[an improved communication policy](http://ftalphaville.ft.com/blog/2011/09/19/680306/breaking-on-fedwire/)

 from the Fed in order to makes its decisions more transparent.
