# Humble Student of the Markets: Three steps and a stumble?

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2016/05/three-steps-and-stumble.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2016/05/three-steps-and-stumble.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models**

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on research outlined in our post 

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The 

**Trend Model**

 is an asset allocation model which applies trend following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or contraction (bearish)?"

My inner trader uses the 

**trading component**

 of the Trend Model to look for changes in direction of the main Trend Model signal. A bullish Trend Model signal that gets less bullish is a trading "sell" signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend Model signal that gets less bullish is a trading "buy" signal. The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. Past trading of the trading model has shown turnover rates of about 200% per month.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Buy equities*
*   Trend Model signal: Neutral*
*   Trading model: Bearish*

* 

*The performance chart and model readings have been delayed by a week out of respect to our paying subscribers.* **Update schedule**

: I generally update model readings on my

 on weekends and tweet any changes during the week at @humblestudent. Subscribers will also receive email notices of any changes in my trading portfolio.

**Some good news and bad news**

The market action last week played out roughly as I expected. Stock prices were choppy and displayed a series of lower highs and lower lows, though the technically important 2040 support neckline of the head and shoulders pattern did not break decisively (see 

[Waiting for the storm to pass](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/05/15/waiting-for-the-storm-to-pass/)

). The short-term trend remains down and key intermediate term indicators has not reach oversold levels, as measured by the NYSE McClellan Oscillator (NYMO) breaching the -80 level and VIX Index moving above its Bollinger Band, which suggests that the current corrective action isn't finished.

There was some good news and bad news as stocks declined...

...specifically, I would like to explore the possibility of the bearish

[three steps and a stumble](https://www.mta.org/kb/three-steps-and-a-stumble/)

scenario, which follows the old trading adage of three Fed tightening moves will tend to lead to a stock market stumble. This scenario is becoming a real possibility as the US economy is still in a fragile state.
