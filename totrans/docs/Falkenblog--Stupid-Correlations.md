# Falkenblog: Stupid Correlations

> 来源：[http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2011/06/stupid-correlations.html#0001-01-01](http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2011/06/stupid-correlations.html#0001-01-01)

Correlation doesn't mean causation, but most people see correlations as causative when they fit their pet theories anyway. If you need a better rejoinder to someone's correlation than '93.7% of statistics are made up on the spot', there's a website for this!

[correlated.org](http://www.correlated.org/)

contains gems like:

> 15 percent of people who dislike mayonnaise are good dancers, compared with 29 percent of people in general.
> 
> 75 percent of people who can't type without looking at the keyboard prefer thin-crust pizza to deep-dish, compared with 59 percent of people in general.
> 
> 61 percent of people who floss regularly prefer credit cards to debit cards, compared with 45 percent of people in general.
