# VIX and More: VIX Overreaction?

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/02/vix-overreaction.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/02/vix-overreaction.html#0001-01-01)

Kudos to [David Merkel](http://alephblog.com/?page_id=2) at [The Aleph Blog](http://alephblog.com/?page_id=2) for [pointing out](http://alephblog.com/?p=27) that with the VIX up 21% and the SPX down 1.5%, the ratio of the two moves is -14, well above the typical -8 to -10 range.

This obviously supports the thinking that today’s moves are out of proportion to the fundamental events that are driving them and should serve as a reminder that the current environment is in no way as dire as some of the past crises that have caused the VIX to spike 20%.  In fact, the magnitude of today’s move may be as much a result of the coiled spring effect (number of days without a 2% correction, etc.) or the volume of the recent bear drumbeat as any fundamental changes in the Chinese economy, geopolitical issues, US durable goods and the like.
