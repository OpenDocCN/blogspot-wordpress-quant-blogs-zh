## BUILD: Metro UI – Enterprise Customers an After Thought?

Interesting [read](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/microsoft-to-make-some-tester-requested-windows-8-ui-concessions/10950). If Win8 is due for 2012, I can’t see it actually hitting the sell-side world given that most sell-side corps are still on XP. I also can’t see an trader with [Metro](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2011/10/11/reflecting-on-your-comments-on-the-start-screen.aspx#comments) on their 6+ monitors.
