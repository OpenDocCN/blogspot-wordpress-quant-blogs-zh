[Equities in a macro sweet spot](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/04/10/equities-in-a-macro-sweet-spot/)

Insiders tend not to be short-term traders and they have long time horizons. The issue of capital gains vs. short-term trading gains are always on their minds, which means that their holding period is at least one year. If they sell, they have to worry the wash sale rule. So should you react to a single data point of insider activity?
