# VIX and More: On Volatility, Probabilities and Distributions

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/01/on-volatility-probabilities-and.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/01/on-volatility-probabilities-and.html#0001-01-01)

When I was in the process of publishing the winners of the [2008 Volatility Awards](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/01/2008-volatility-awards.html) last week, I paused before finalizing [Don Fishback’s Market Update](https://www.donfishback.com/blog/) as the recipient of the award for *Best New Blog with a Volatility Focus*. While there are many excellent blogs out there, my hesitation had nothing to do with the quality of Don’s site, which you should judge for yourself. Instead I wondered what would happen if hundreds of curious readers clicked over to the site and Don just happened to be taking a couple of weeks off for the holidays.

Well…Don is back and has a post up that is the early leader in the volatility post of the year category (should I decide to invent such a beast at some point.) Starting with the not-so-pity title of [Probability, VIX, Bad Math, and Reporters Who Don’t Know the Difference: Measure, Don’t Model](https://www.donfishback.com/blog/2009/01/06/probability-vix-bad-math-and-reporters-who-dont-know-the-difference/), Don Addresses some of the mathematical shortcomings of the Kearns and Tsang article, [VIX Fails to Forecast S&P 500 Drop, Loses Followers](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601110&sid=a6bJKg1wZ8Vc) and argues from the specific to the general case. For dessert, Don Serves up a [nifty tool](https://www.donfishback.com/blog/bca/index.php) to help readers visualize the various probabilities and distributions associated with the VIX and the SPX.

Assuming the VIX does not spike back up to the 80s again, I will use this space to talk a lot more about probabilities and distributions in 2009 – and their application to the study of volatility.
