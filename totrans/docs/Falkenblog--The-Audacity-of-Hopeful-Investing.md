# Falkenblog: The Audacity of Hopeful Investing

Warren Buffet and many old experts note the distinction between gambling or speculating, and investing. Gambling is investing without an edge, such as when one plays the lottery, or invests in stock without alpha. Investing is what Warren Buffet does.

has become a prominent talking head with the advice to invest mainly in Tbills, but then a modest portion in something with large and unquantifiable upside: the potential next Google or Harry Potter. I think this is foolhardy, because uncertainty is correlated with volatility and factor loadings, and historically, earnings estimate variability, high volatility, or high beta stocks, all

, statistically (ie, on average). So too for the biggest longshot horses, or highest payoff lotteries, call options, movies, etc. Things that can generate lottery-like payoffs, have lottery-like returns.

The annual per capita lottery expenditure in the US is about $150, and the rate of return is about -47% per dollar played. These investments clearly cater to what is commonly called those seeking risk, or positive skew, in particular. A study of the popularity (sales) of lotteries found that average payout (expected return) did not matter, but the size of the top prize was highly significant in motivating popularity. In other words, the $100 million super lotto has a lot of sales even though the probability of winning is so small it basically is outside the realm of intuition (1 in 150 million). A St.Louis Fed

finds that those with household income of less than $25,000 spent twice as much on lotteries on a per capita basis, than those with a household income over $100,000\. Such bad decision making is probably not orthogonal to their poverty status. Investing in lottery tickets, however packaged, is a great way to stay poor.

So I found it interesting that the otherwise sober Arnold Kling fell prey to the bias of finding these highly

If I were an investor in this market, I would be inclined to make Black Swan style bets. Philosophy majors, for example. Sure, a lot of them will end up as pathetic adjunct professors. But some of them will eventually apply their intellect and creativity to business.

Basically, Kling hypothesizes that those wild, free thinking philosophy majors will have a higher average income because of a few 'whales' in their sample. A couple Steve Jobs or some other dreamer. Kling has fallen victim to the allure of hope, in that for things we have no data on, the classes of investments with conspicuous winners seem attractive. Thats why every millionaire from

Of course, I can't prove this (I bet it's in a paper somewhere), but the bias suggests Kling is wrong because he thinks too much of conspicuous successes, and using the dreaded '
