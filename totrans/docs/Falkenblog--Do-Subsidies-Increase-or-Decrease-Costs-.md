# Falkenblog: Do Subsidies Increase or Decrease Costs?

I guess this is debatable (who knew?). Federal college aid has

[risen 165%](http://freeminds-edu.com/?p=471)

over the past decade, and college costs have

[risen about 74%](http://www.solutionsforourfuture.org/rising_prices.htm)

over that same period. Yet some think that increased costs are from our stingy federal government.  For example,

over at Huffpost notes:

> College tuition is soaring because the state contribution to budgets is being slashed

Obama has

[a plan](http://roomfordebate.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/03/rising-college-costs-a-federal-role/)

to increase aid in response. The Obama administration has already taken a series of steps to expand the availability of grants and loans and to make loans easier to pay back, proposed extending the tuition tax break and keep loan interest rates artificially low. Even

[Ron Paul is for](http://www.issues2000.org/2012/Ron_Paul_Education.htm)

specialized tax credits for college. It's hard to blame politicians for doing what sells. Paul Krugman

[tendentiously presents](http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/12/building-a-caste-society/)

data for the idea that cost are rising because of of government cutbacks, ignoring the increasing irrelevancy of the full-tuition price and other issues, so it's possible to hold such beliefs by referencing properly credential authorities (as are most opinions).

When you subsidize something, you shift out demand which causes quantity and price to increase. It simply isn't true that prices rise due to smaller government subsidies.
