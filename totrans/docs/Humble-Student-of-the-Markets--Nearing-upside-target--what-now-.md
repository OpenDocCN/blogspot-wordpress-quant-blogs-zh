# Humble Student of the Markets: Nearing upside target, what now?

**Mid-week market update**

: Back on July 19, 2017, I wrote about using point and figure charting as a way of projecting an upside SPX target when the index stood at 2473 (see

[What's the upside target in this rally?](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2017/07/19/whats-the-upside-target-in-this-rally/)

). Using different sets of inputs that represent different time horizons and risk tolerances, I arrived at a target range, and a median upside target of 2561\. The final targets were roughly the same whether outliers (highlighted in red) were removed or not.

Now that the index is within about 1% shy of the median target, what now?
