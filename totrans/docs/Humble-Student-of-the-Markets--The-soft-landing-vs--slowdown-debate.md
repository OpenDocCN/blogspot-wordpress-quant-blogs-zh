# Humble Student of the Markets: The soft landing vs. slowdown debate

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2023/07/the-soft-landing-vs-slowdown-debate.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2023/07/the-soft-landing-vs-slowdown-debate.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models** 

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post, 

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The 

**Trend Asset Allocation Model**

 is an asset allocation model that applies trend-following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity prices. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. The performance and full details of a model portfolio based on the out-of-sample signals of the Trend Model can be found

[here](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/trend-model-report-card/)

.

My inner trader uses a 

**trading model**

, which is a blend of price momentum (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa). Subscribers receive real-time alerts of model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of the email alerts is updated weekly 

[here](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/trading-track-record/)

. The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that began in March 2016 is shown below.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Sell equities (Last changed from “buy” on 26-Mar-2023)*
*   Trend Model signal: Neutral (Last changed from “bullish” on 17-Mar-2023)*
*   Trading model: Neutral (Last changed from “bearish” on 15-Jun-2023)*

** The performance chart and model readings have been delayed by a week out of respect to our paying subscribers.***Update schedule**

: I generally update model readings on my

#### A fragile consensus

It’s remarkable how swiftly the consensus narrative can change. Two weeks ago, the 2-year Treasury yield spike above 5% when the ADP Non-farm Employment report came in at a blowout 497K, which was well ahead of expectations of 228K. The news prompted speculation that the Fed would have to tighten more than expected and send the economy into recession.

Last week, the softer-than-expected CPI report abruptly shifted the tone of the consensus to a soft landing and sparked a risk-on rally in risk assets and yields retreated. This matters because the 2-year Treasury yield is a proxy for market expectations of the Fed Funds rate. Past peaks in the 2-year rate have either been coincidental or led peaks in Fed Funds.

The current environment illustrates the fragile nature of the market consensus. If the narrative can flip from bear to bull in a week, it may not take much for it to flip back. The market is at a critical juncture. Team Soft Landing is locked in a cage match with Team Slowdown. Who wins?
