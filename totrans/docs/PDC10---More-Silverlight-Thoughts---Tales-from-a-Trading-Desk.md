## PDC10 – More Silverlight Thoughts

It appears that blog land is finally beginning to think about what really came out of PDC10, rather than the reaction to various articles about PDC10\. Apart from Microsoft poorly articulated message, and the lack of anything to say about Silverlight (do we really have to wait to Mix 2011?), there are at least a few people who are thinking differently:

*   Silverlight is [Dead](http://weblogs.asp.net/dwahlin/archive/2010/11/01/silverlight-is-dead-the-moon-is-made-of-cheese-and-html-5-is-ready-for-prime-time.aspx), the Moon is Made of Cheese, and HTML 5 is Ready for Prime Time
*   My position on the #Silverlight [debate](http://blog.galasoft.ch/archive/2010/10/30/my-position-on-the-silverlight-debate.aspx)
