# VIX and More: VIX Views

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2012/01/vix-views.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2012/01/vix-views.html#0001-01-01)

Yesterday, I learned that the people at S&P 500 Indices and the CBOE have collaborated on a new blog with the name of [VIX Views](http://www.spvixviews.com/).

The best news about VIX Views is the high quality of contributors and content. The most recent posts, all of which have appeared since January 7, include the following:

*   Matt Moran (CBOE) – Why Are There Different Prices for VIX Spot and VIX Futures?
*   Matt Moran (CBOE) – VXEEM Futures: 1,106 Trading Volume on the 3rd Day of Trading
*   Siddhartha Oberoi (S&P Indices) – VIX ETPs Demystified: December 2011
*   Frank Luo (S&P Indices) – An Introduction to VIX
*   Berlinda Lu (S&P Indices) – Diversification Properties of VIX Futures Indices
*   Berlinda Lu (S&P Indices) – Volatility Benchmarks in Europe

I encourage readers to take advantage of this resource and the valuable information stored in the archives, which date back to November 2011.

In thinking about *VIX and More* as a repository of information on the VIX, volatility and related subjects, I am reminded that I have tagged quite a few posts with the [educational](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/educational) label. While I consider almost every post here to be educational, those with the educational label stand out above the crowd, particularly for those who may be relatively new to the VIX and/or are in search of material which does not assume a great deal of pre-existing knowledge.

Some of these posts with the educational label have been included in the links below. I have also included several posts in which I have highlighted resources on the VIX and volatility that I thought readers should be aware of.

Going forward, I have some thoughts about how to bring together all the material on this site in a manner that is easier to browse, but for now at least, [Navigating VIX and More by the Labels](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2012/01/navigating-vix-and-more-by-labels.html) will have to suffice.
