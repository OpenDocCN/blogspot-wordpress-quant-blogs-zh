## Capital Market Big Data Use Cases

Couple of interesting use cases in this InfoQ [video](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/big-data-capital-markets):

*   Broker-Dealer transaction history
*   Client Review
*   Customer Relations and Prospecting
*   Enterprise Credit Risk
*   Cluster Pricing

Clearly the presentation didn’t have time to get into Lambda architectures, Spark and more
