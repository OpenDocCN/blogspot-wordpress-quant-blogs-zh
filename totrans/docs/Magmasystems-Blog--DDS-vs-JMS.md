# Magmasystems Blog: DDS vs JMS

> 来源：[http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2007/09/dds-vs-jms.html#0001-01-01](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2007/09/dds-vs-jms.html#0001-01-01)

[Data Distribution Service](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Distribution_Service)

(DDS) is an alternative to JMS. This spec was designed and is supported by

[OMG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Management_Group)

(Object Management Group). The concepts are fairly familiar to anyone who has done JMS.

RTI implements DDS in their message bus.

My feeling is that getting a large enterprise to use DDS is akin to rewiring a battleship. However, it seems like DDS has some possible performance improvements over JMS.

Anybody out there using DDS?
