# VIX and More: Expiring Monthly July Issue Recap

Personal and technical issues have conspired to keep this blog quiet for a few days, but that is about to change.

Before I get back to regular posting, I wanted to inform Expiring Monthly readers and potential new subscribers that Monday marked the publication of the July issue of [*Expiring Monthly: The Option Traders Journal*](http://www.expiringmonthly.com/).

The July issue is rich in volatility content. Among my favorite volatility-centric articles are a piece from Adam Warner on the VIX [term structure](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/term%20structure) and [contango](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/contango), a thought-provoking discussion of how retail traders influence options volatility by Jared Woodard, and Mark Wolfinger’s review of Euan Sinclair’s excellent book, [Volatility Trading](http://www.amazon.com/Volatility-Trading-CD-ROM-Wiley/dp/0470181990/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpt_1). My main contribution this month comes in the form of an article on VIX call backspreads in “*An (Almost) Free VIX Disaster Protection Play*.” I also detail some of my thinking and analysis of VIX futures contango as it applies to VXX in the “*Ask the Experts*” Q&A section.

In this month’s feature article, Mark Sebastian addresses the not-so-simple question of whether options are a zero-sum game. Mark also interviews renowned author [Charles Cottle](http://www.riskdoctor.com/about-us).

I have attached a copy of the Table of Contents for the July issue below for those who may be interested in what this magazine is all about. Subscription information and additional details about the magazine are available at [http://www.expiringmonthly.com/](http://www.expiringmonthly.com/).
