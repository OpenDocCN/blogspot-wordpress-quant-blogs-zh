# Magmasystems Blog: Sybase/Aleri

> 来源：[http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2010/01/sybasealeri.html#0001-01-01](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2010/01/sybasealeri.html#0001-01-01)

I am writing this a few days before the Sybase announcement that they purchased Aleri. I am absolutely stunned at the collective yawn that this news has produced. Nothing from Wall Street & Technology magazine. Nothing on the Streambase blog. Nothing from Tim Bass.

I guess that the mere mention of CEP does not get anyone's pulse moving anymore.
