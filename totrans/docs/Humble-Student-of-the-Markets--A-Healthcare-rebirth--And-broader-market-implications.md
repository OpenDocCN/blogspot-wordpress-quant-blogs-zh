# Humble Student of the Markets: A Healthcare rebirth? And broader market implications

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2019/04/a-healthcare-rebirth-and-broader-market.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2019/04/a-healthcare-rebirth-and-broader-market.html#0001-01-01)

It is Easter Monday, a day when Christians focus on the theme of rebirth and resurrection, Healthcare stocks just underwent a near-death experience when the market panicked over the prospect of a Democrat victory in 2020, and the potential negative effects of the implementation of a Medicare-For-All policy.

To be sure, there are costs to be taken out of the system. The US spends more than any other industrialized country on health care, with a lower life expectancy.

Indeed, the political winds are starting to shift.

 reported that Republicans are becoming more open to the idea of passing a bill that will lower drug prices:

> The White House and top lawmakers from both parties think a bill to lower drug prices has a better chance of becoming law before the 2020 election than any other controversial legislation.
> 
> **Between the lines:** Republican politics on drug prices have changed rapidly. The White House has told Democrats it has no red lines on the substance of drug pricing — a position that should leave pharma quaking.

We have seen these kinds of scares before.
