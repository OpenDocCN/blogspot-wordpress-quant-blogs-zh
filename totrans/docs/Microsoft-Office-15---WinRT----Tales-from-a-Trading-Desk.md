## Microsoft Office 15 – WinRT?

Little appears to be known yet on what [Office 15](http://blogs.office.com/b/office-exec/archive/2012/01/30/quot-office-15-quot-begins-technical-preview.aspx) will offer, apart from it being “the most ambitious undertaking yet for the Office Division”. Byte offers a [view](http://www.informationweek.com/byte/news/personal-tech/tablets/232500810) on Office 15 and Metro. Mary Jo Foley offers a view [here](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/microsofts-office-15-to-metro-or-not-to-metro/11774). Given the investment Microsoft is making in Metro and the WinRT, should we expect a WinRT Office? I suspect Office 15 will not be tied to WinRT, since this would restrict Office 15 sales to Windows 8, an OS that appears more for the consumer than the enterprise – especially as so many corporations are still on Windows XP 😦
