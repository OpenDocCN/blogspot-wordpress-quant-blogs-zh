# Timely Portfolio: Extreme Bond Returns

> 来源：[http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2012/01/extreme-bond-returns.html#0001-01-01](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2012/01/extreme-bond-returns.html#0001-01-01)

20 years of data is nowhere near enough to satisfy my insatiable appetite for bigger datasets.  While I showed [Record Long Term Treasury Returns](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2011/12/record-long-term-treasury-returns.html) with Vanguard’s US Long Treasury mutual fund, its 20 year life is not sufficient to give me comfort risking money.  What happens when we take the Moody’s AAA rate series dating back to 1919?

My opinion changes dramatically when I include 70 more years, and the opportunity is much less certain.
