# Humble Student of the Markets: What June swoon?

**Mid-week market update**

: Sell in May? June swoon? Not so far! As the SPX convincingly staged an upside breakout above the 2740 resistance level, the bull case is easy to make. We have seen fresh all-time highs this week from the following:

*   NASDAQ Composite
*   Russell 2000 small caps
*   NYSE Advance-Decline Line
*   NASDAQ Advance-Decline Line

I probably forgot a few, but you get the idea. In addition, the metrics of risk appetite, such as the ratio of high beta to low volatility stocks, is exhibiting a positive divergence.

Hold the celebrations! While I have been bullish throughout this corrective episode, I am very aware that the bulls still have some short-term challenges to overcome.
