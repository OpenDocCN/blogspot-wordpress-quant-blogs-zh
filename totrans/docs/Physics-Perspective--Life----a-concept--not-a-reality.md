Scientists have struggled for many years to define life. What is living and what is not? Is a virus alive? What about a growing crystal? No one has been successful, and I think I agree with

[Ferris Jabr in the New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/13/opinion/why-nothing-is-truly-alive.html?_r=0)

: there is no answer. There simply is no sharp dividing line between what is alive and what is not. The idea that there should be is a confusion, a prejudice, and it is all in our heads; it's not a part of reality.
