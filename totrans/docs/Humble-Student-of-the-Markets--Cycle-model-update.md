# Humble Student of the Markets: Cycle model update

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2014/03/cycle-model-update.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2014/03/cycle-model-update.html#0001-01-01)

Further to yesterday's post about the 20-week cycle (

[Cycles in the eye of the beholder](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2014/03/cycles-in-eye-of-beholder.html)

), where my former Merrill Lynch colleague

[Walter Murphy](http://www.wminsights.com/)

identified this week as the bottom of the 20-week cycle (which lasts 21-22 weeks), a reader noted that the chart that I showed spanned five years, which represented a bull market. As such the "buy" signals represented by the 20-week cycle was tested on a market that had an upward bias.

Here is the same chart of a 21-week cycle for the last 10 years. The vertical lines represent supposed 21-week cycle bottoms. The blue arrows represent "good" buy signals, where the market was higher 4-6 weeks later; and the "red" arrows represent "bad" buy signals, where the market fell 4-6 weeks later.

Here is the good news. There are still more blue arrows than red arrows despite the devastating 2007-2009 bear market. What's more, this was able to identify short-term bottoms in the waterfall decline of 2008 and therefore these results make the 20-week signal intriguing as a timing tool.

The bad news is that this identified the 2007 top as a bottom and missed the ultimate bottom in 2009 all together.

Does this make the 20-week cycle a useful market timing tool? I have always been somewhat skeptical of the cycle approach to technical analysis, but this chart has changed my mind. My preliminary conclusion is that it may be useful and deserves a place in the toolkit of a technical analyst.
