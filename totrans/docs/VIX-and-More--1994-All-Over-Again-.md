# VIX and More: 1994 All Over Again?

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/01/apropos-of-recent-discussion-about.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/01/apropos-of-recent-discussion-about.html#0001-01-01)

Apropos of the recent discussion about previous periods of low volatility, Doug Kass at TSCM has an article, [Bears Locate a Template for a Crash](http://www.thestreet.com/_tscana/markets/activetraderupdate/10334755.html), devoted to the many similarities between early 2007 and early 1994.

Kass succinctly recalls what happened in 1994:

> "A two-month drop of nearly 10% in the S&P 500 Index began at the end of January 1994\. The emerging markets collapsed -- Hong Kong's market fell by a third and Mexico by an even greater amount. The bond market got schmeissed -- by year-end, the 10-year U.S. note had fallen 20 points, correcting the entire gain of the previous three years. Finally, the VIX fell back to 1990 levels, climbing from 9 to 24 in only two months..."

Today's 13% rise in the VIX does not necessarily herald the beginning of another sharp shock, but it should be enough to make the bulls a little more skittish for awhile.
