## Dryad Release (Academic Licensing) – Moving onto Azure

Sounds like [Dryad](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/Dryad/) will be moved onto Azure, and possibly a product in a few years 🙂 Channel9 has the video’s to [watch](http://channel9.msdn.com/tags/DryadLINQ/). Basically its [distributed](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/collaboration/tools/dryad.aspx) programming – accessing resources of a computer cluster or a data center for running data-parallel programs. LINQ distribution 🙂 – overview of [DryadLINQ](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/dryadlinq/default.aspx) here. All you need is a [HPCS](http://www.microsoft.com/hpc/en/us/default.aspx) and in 30mins you can be up and running. F# samples are included in the [release](http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/?p=3385).
