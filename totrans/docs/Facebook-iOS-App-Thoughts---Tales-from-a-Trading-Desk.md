## Facebook iOS App Thoughts

Reading Facebook’s thoughts on [iOS vs HTML](https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/under-the-hood-rebuilding-facebook-for-ios/10151036091753920) it appears that the “write once and ship across multiple platforms” view isn’t working for Facebook in the  iOS devices space.  Reminds me of Sun [slogan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write_once,_run_anywhere).  Wonder if [Apple](http://www.apple.com/html5/) care?
