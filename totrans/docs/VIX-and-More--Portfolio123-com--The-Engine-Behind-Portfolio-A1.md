# VIX and More: Portfolio123.com: The Engine Behind Portfolio A1

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/10/portfolio123com-engine-behind-portfolio.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/10/portfolio123com-engine-behind-portfolio.html#0001-01-01)

A reader asked which tool I used to develop and manage [Portfolio A1](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Portfolio%20A1).

I talked a little about [Portfolio123.com](http://www.portfolio123.com/)’s functionality when I [introduced Portfolio A1](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/02/new-feature-2-portfolio123-live.html) back in February, but I probably should have said more about this excellent web site.  In a nutshell, Portfolio123.com is a web site that provides a comprehensive set of tools to help an investor develop stock ranking systems (not filters, but systems that rank all stocks based upon user-selected and weighted fundamental and/or technical criteria), backtest those ranking systems, and evaluate ranking systems based upon buying and selling rules established by the user.  While many tools and features are available, one of most important features Portfolio123.com offers is high quality portfolio-level backtesting for stock ranking engines in combination with any associated portfolio management rules that users choose wrap around these ranking engines.  In addition to backtesting, Portfolio123.com makes it easy for investors to manage and evaluate portfolios in real-time once they have been launched.  Portfolio A1 is one such example; I have included a snapshot of one of my earliest efforts below. The more senior portfolio carries the unwieldy name of Bal4d 98S T10, but has been up and running for over three years with excellent results to date.

There are many other tools available in addition to the graphic I have included below; in the future I will highlight some of these tools in the context of Portfolio A1.

I encourage anyone who is interested to [investigate Portfolio123.com's functionality](http://www.portfolio123.com/doc/moreinfo.jsp), [read some reviews](http://www.portfolio123.com/recentnews.jsp), [watch some product tours](http://www.portfolio123.com/index.jsp), [check out the FAQs and other documentation](http://www.portfolio123.com/help_index.jsp), and [test drive the site with their 14 day free trial](https://www.portfolio123.com/signup.jsp).

For the record, I have no relationship with Portfolio123.com other than that of a satisfied customer.
