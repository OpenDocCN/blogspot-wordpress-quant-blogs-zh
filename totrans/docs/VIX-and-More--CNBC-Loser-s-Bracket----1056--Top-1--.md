![](img/fc3af7d92d43484757cd7c13dcc06dac.png)For those who may be interested, the [CNBC Million Dollar Portfolio Challenge](http://www.cnbc.com/id/17506588/) is winding down this week, with 20 top performers duking it out for $1 million paid out over many years through an IV drip, while the [Second Chance Showdown](http://www.cnbc.com/id/18819614) contestants get another shot at glory in the loser’s bracket – with a [Sony](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=sne&hl=en) home entertainment system as a consolation prize to the winner.

I never had a chance to properly [chronicle](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/CNBC%20Million%20Dollar%20Portfolio%20Challenge) the true extent of my rise and fall in the first round of this contest, as CNBC wiped away the details before I do a proper post-mortem.  All I know is that after peaking at the [top 0.08%](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/04/cnbc-million-dollar-portfolio-challenge_30.html), I fell down to about the [top 11%](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/05/cnbc-million-dollar-portfolio-challenge_07.html), finally finishing something like 200,000^(th), perhaps even lower.

The good news is that the contest gave me an opportunity to test some ideas about how to find stock that were about to make a significant move.  Since the end of the contest fell in the middle of earnings season, I focused on companies that were due to report in the next 24 hours and published the details of my formula and some associated free public information sources in “[How to Find the Spiker Before the Earnings Announcement](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/05/how-to-find-earnings-spiker-before.html)” on May 9^(th).  Recently, I went back and evaluated the 16 companies that I invested in as a result of that earnings spiker formula and discovered that the minimum next day move for those companies was 1.5%, while the maximum move was 30.2% (down in this case), with a mean move of 5.6% and a median move of 3.7% – all of which is based on a one day holding period.

Armed with this information, I thought I should put the same formula to work again in the loser’s bracket.  Once again it has been successful, with my last four picks being a 3.0% gain in [PETM](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=petm&hl=en), a 7.7% gain in [FMCN](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=fmcn&hl=en), a 5.3% gain in [TSL](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=tsl&hl=en), and a 3.0% gain in [SNDA](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=snda&hl=en).  The bottom line is that this performance has put me in the top 1% of the current contest at #1056.

Before I start patting myself on the back, however, it looks like I may have shot myself in the foot.  Shanghai-based Shanda Entertainment was a solid earnings pick and turned in a [very strong quarter](http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/070523/shanda_interactive_ahead_of_the_bell.html?.v=3), but it appears I was foiled by my own [Lost in Translation](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0335266/) moment and accidentally sold prior to earnings.  To make matters worse, I jumped from the Shanda rocked onto [GameStop (GME)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=gme&hl=en), whose [doubling of revenues was offset by lukewarm guidance](http://www.thestreet.com/_yahoo/newsanalysis/techgames/10358502.html?cm_ven=YAHOO&amp;cm_cat=FREE&cm_ite=NA).  I got my volatility again, but GME is currently trading down 3.6% on the day.
