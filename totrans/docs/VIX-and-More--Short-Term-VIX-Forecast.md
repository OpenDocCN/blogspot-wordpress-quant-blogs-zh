# VIX and More: Short-Term VIX Forecast

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/06/short-term-vix-forecast.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/06/short-term-vix-forecast.html#0001-01-01)

Based on historical precedent, I am forecasting that the VIX will snap back about 9% in the next three trading days and 12% over the course of the next five trading days. This gives me the following end of day price targets for the VIX:
Tuesday, June 12th: 15.52 Thursday, June 14th: 15.01 It will be interesting to see how closely the current VIX spike tracks with historical standards.
