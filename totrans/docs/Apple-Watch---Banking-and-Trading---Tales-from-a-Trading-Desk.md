## Apple Watch – Banking and Trading

Before taking a look at what is currently available for Apple Watch in the banking and trading space, its probably worth having a read of the [WatchKit](https://developer.apple.com/watchkit/), and the three types of apps available on the Apple Watch:

*   WatchKit App – architecture overview can be seen [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/General/Conceptual/WatchKitProgrammingGuide/DesigningaWatchKitApp.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014969-CH3-SW1).
*   Glances
*   Actionable Notifications.

Julian has a fairly simple [tutorial](http://www.appcoda.com/watchkit-introduction-tutorial/), “WatchKit Introduction: Building a Simple Guess Game”, if you want to kick the [tires](http://www.raywenderlich.com/89562/watchkit-tutorial-with-swift-getting-started) on an Apple Watch.

In the Consumer banking space, [Citi](http://www.techworld.com/news/wearables/citi-unveils-banking-app-for-apple-watch-3601088/) is one of the many [banks](http://www.forbes.com/sites/avidan/2015/03/31/how-citibank-is-transforming-itself-by-partnering-with-apple-watch/) that are jumping on the Apple Watch wagon. Tangerine (Scotiabank), Fidelity and PFM specialist Mint are also going Watch.  Misys has developed a bank-to-consumer marketing app [prototype](http://www.finextra.com/news/fullstory.aspx?newsitemid=27175).  Down under, [CommBank](http://mashable.com/2015/04/09/commonwealth-bank-apple-watch/) will allow bank [balances](http://www.zdnet.com/article/commbank-brings-mobile-banking-app-to-smartwatches/) to be show with a tap, and also Cardless Cash withdrawals at ATMs.

> The Apple Watch app includes a [transaction](http://www.forbes.com/sites/avidan/2015/03/31/how-citibank-is-transforming-itself-by-partnering-with-apple-watch/) alerts that show color-coded visuals of how close users are to their credit limits. This is part of a trend in which personal financial management (PFM) services are making a comeback, and what some believe will become even more personal, wearable devices.

> The CommBank app for [smartwatches](http://www.zdnet.com/article/commbank-brings-mobile-banking-app-to-smartwatches/) will initially provide customers with three key functions: The ability to check account balances, find the nearest ATM, and make cashless card withdrawals from ATMS.

On the [trading](http://www.ig.com/uk/apple-watch-trading-app) side, [IG](http://talkbusinessmagazine.co.uk/2015/04/09/ig-leading-trading-app-innovation-on-apple-watch/) appears to be ahead with regards to trading from your wrist.  IG Apple Watch trading app is a distilled version of the existing iPhone app that allows investors to find, edit and open trades from their wrists.  [Key](http://www.financemagnates.com/forex/brokers/ig-group-first-unveil-apple-watch-trading-application/) IG app [features](http://leaprate.com/2015/03/ig-group-set-to-launch-apple-watch-trading-app/) include:

*   Spread bet, trade CFDs, and buy and sell stocks.
*   Get iPhone app notifications on your wrist.
*   Open positions and view markets from your watchlist.
*   Open, edit and close positions, or see all open positions.
*   See upcoming financial events.
*   Use one-tap login and switch between accounts easily.
