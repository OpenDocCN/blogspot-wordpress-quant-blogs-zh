[This is a very short interview](http://www.moneyscience.com/pg/blog/Admin/read/537995/video-professor-david-cliff-discusses-high-frequency-trading?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+TheCompleteMoneyscience+%28The+Complete+MoneyScience%29)

with Dave Cliff of the University of Bristol who knows more about high frequency trading, the good and the bad, than just about anyone else. Short take: the wild west period may be over, the potential for huge profits has been arbitraged away, HFT now looks more like part of the fixed and settled landscape than something really new.
