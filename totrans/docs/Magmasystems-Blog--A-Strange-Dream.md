I had a very strange dream last night. I dreamed that I left my current job and went to work for Google. When I got there, I found myself in a big loft, surrounded by 20-something year old geniuses. I asked them where my desk and computer was. They looked at me with puzzlement. I asked then where all of the computer monitors were, and they didn't know what a computer monitor was. I started describing how, on the trading floor where I worked, the traders has 6 or 8 monitors stacked on their desks. Then everyone started to laugh at me.

In seemed that everyone at Google worked on laptops. They had no conception of what a desktop system was, and the fact that a trader had multiple monitors seemed absurd. The Google-ites didn't even have desks. They just sat on the floor wherever they wanted with their laptops.

I think that the dream was inspired by

[an article](http://www.parsintl.com/18847.pdf)

that a friend just sent me.

And, it got me wondering if we at the large investment banks could be doing things in a better way .....
