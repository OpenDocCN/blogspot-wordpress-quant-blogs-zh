I am not going to be in New York that day, but STAC has a few topics of interest at their upcoming conference on November 2nd.

"Hadoop for Trading Firms: Beyond the Science Project," by Jack Norris, VP Marketing, MapR

“Standard Technology Benchmarks for Market Risk Platforms,” by Lars Ericson, Director, Citi

It's nice to see someone from Citi presenting :-) Wish they had more people from the client side of things presenting.
