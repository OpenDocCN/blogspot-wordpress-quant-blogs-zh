# Humble Student of the Markets: Feedback on a book project

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2009/01/feedback-on-book-project.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2009/01/feedback-on-book-project.html#0001-01-01)

I would like to ask for your help in giving me some feedback.

Over the years, I have watched as a number of experienced friends and colleagues move from the sell side to the buy side and struggle with the business realities of the money management business. Their problems were mainly attributable to the fact that there is a lot more to investment management than knowing what to buy and sell.

I have posted on this topic (see

[part 1](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2008/01/what-do-you-do-after-youve-made-your.html)

,

[part 2](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2008/01/what-do-you-do-after-youve-made-your_10.html)

and

[part 3](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2008/01/what-do-you-after-youve-made-your-picks.html)

). I decided to work on a book outlining some of the issues surrounding the business of investment management, as training in this topic seems to be severely deficient. Just as dentists come out of dental school knowing all about dentistry, but most don’t know anything about running a dental practice, analysts come out of business school knowing little about investment management.

I have outlined a table of contents for the proposed book. I would welcome any comments from investment professionals or MBA students in business programs.

How do you feel about this topic?

Is there anything else that I should address?

Please leave your feedback in the comment section or email me at
