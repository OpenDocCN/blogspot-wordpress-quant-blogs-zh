> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2017/05/the-right-and-wrong-ways-to-use-rydex.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2017/05/the-right-and-wrong-ways-to-use-rydex.html#0001-01-01)

Rydex funds (now Guggenheim) were early pioneers in offering bull and bear funds, as well as to encouraging switching between bull and bear funds. This innovation attracted short-term traders who had previously been shunned by other mutual fund families. Consequently, Rydex fund assets became an important measure of short-term trader sentiment.

Over the years, I have seen numerous analysts using Rydex data to support their investment conclusions. Most of it has been wrong. The latest came from
