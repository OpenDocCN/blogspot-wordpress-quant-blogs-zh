The CBOE is out with a [press release](http://www.cboe.com/AboutCBOE/ShowDocument.aspx?DIR=ACNews&FILE=cboe_cfe_20090225.doc&CreateDate=25.02.2009) confirming that [mini-VIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/mini-VIX) futures will begin trading next Monday.

The mini-VIX is 1/10 the size of the standard [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures) contract, making the mini-VIX much more approachable for the typical retail investor.
