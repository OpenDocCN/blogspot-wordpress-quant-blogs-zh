## Big Data: Smart analytics

The Low Latency summit this [week](http://low-latency.com/blog/low-latency-summit-low-latency-gives-way-big-data-and-analytics) provided some good visibility on Big [Data](http://low-latency.com/event/low-latency-summit-2013-london-autumn/agenda) and low latency processing – Data driven analytics using big fast data. Few interesting take aways:

> low latency data processing, focusing on application logic, in-memory storage or pre- and post-trade analytics, in support of intelligent trading

> 
> Nick Idelson, technical director at TraderServe: First, “data is good and clean”.  Then, “whether it matches up and whether there is any jitter”.  Finally, the solution leveraging the data.
> 
> Pre-trade risk – driving low latency big data
