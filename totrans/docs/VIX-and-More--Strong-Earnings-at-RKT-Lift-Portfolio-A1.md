[Strong earnings](http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/070426/rock_tenn_mover.html?.v=1) at [Rock-Tenn Co. (RKT)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=rkt&hl=en) helped propel the company to a 14% gain on Thursday, before a CSFB [downgrade](http://news.moneycentral.msn.com/ticker/article.aspx?Feed=Bcom&amp;amp;Date=20070427&ID=6808991&Symbol=RKT) trimmed the stock price 4% on Friday.  RKT’s weekly gain of 8.6% now makes it the top performer in the portfolio (up 24% in a little less than two months) and has helped to increase Portfolio A1’s advantage over the benchmark S&P 500 index to 6.8%.

It is worth noting that while four of the five holdings continue to sport double digit gains since being added to the portfolio, [WCG](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=wcg&hl=en)’s lackluster week dropped it in to the red.  Some analysts have expressed concern about WCG’s [medical loss ratio](http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/070425/health_insurers_sector_snap.html?.v=1); continued [insider selling](http://www.secform4.com/insider-trading/1279363.htm) probably has done little to reassure investors.

There are no changes to the portfolio for the coming week.

A snapshot of the portfolio is as follows:
