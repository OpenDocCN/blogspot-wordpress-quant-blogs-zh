If history is any guide, stock prices should continue to grind upwards for the next couple of weeks.

As the market tests resistance at all-time highs, further strength would imply a sustainable advance to further highs. However, an analysis of market breadth and sector leadership indicates the equity market faces a number of technical headwinds.
