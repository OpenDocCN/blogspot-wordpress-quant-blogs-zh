## Chrome App Launcher for the Enterprise

Given Google’s recent release of the [Chrome App Launcher](http://chrome.blogspot.co.uk/2013/09/a-new-breed-of-chrome-apps.html), coupled with the ability to [publish](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/2649489?hl=en) a [private](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/2663860) Chrome App, has Google given Chrome an easy road into deploying [powerful](http://chrome.blogspot.co.uk/2013/09/a-new-breed-of-chrome-apps.html) “desktop like” HTML5 applications for the enterprise?  Off-line is great, but the desktop notifications feature of Chrome Apps [offering](http://blog.chromium.org/2013/05/rich-notifications-in-chrome.html) “get reminders, updates and even take action, right from the notification center” make me think about dealing with RFQ’s and other such request in the context of a trading application.  [Rich-notifications](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-app-samples/tree/master/rich-notifications) offers food for thought.
