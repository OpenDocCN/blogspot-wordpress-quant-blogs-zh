## Uber – Kafka and Elasticsearch

[Stream Processing in Uber](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/uber-stream-processing) is work a watch over on InfoQ.  Events emitted by applications, and processed by Apache [Samza](http://samza.apache.org/) via consumption from Kafka.  Storage of data in Elasticsearch.  Which leads to a Lambda architecture, once Spark is added to the Uber architecture.  Very informative talk.
