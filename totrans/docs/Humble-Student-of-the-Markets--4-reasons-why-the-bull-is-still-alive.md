# Humble Student of the Markets: 4 reasons why the bull is still alive

**Mid-week market update**

: In light of the recent market turmoil, I thought I would publish my mid-week market update early. The Shanghai Index moved into bear market territory by declining 20% on a peak-to-trough basis overnight. The SPX is testing its 50 day moving average (dma). Europe is struggling as both the FTSE 100 and Euro STOXX 50 have violated near-term support levels.

Is this a warning that the bull is dying?

I have some good news and bad news. The good news is the bull market is still alive. The SPX is undergoing a correction, but it remains in an uptrend within a range-bound consolidation that began in February.

The bad news is traders need to expect more short-term pain.
