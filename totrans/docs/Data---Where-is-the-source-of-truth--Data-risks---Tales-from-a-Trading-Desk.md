## Data – Where is the source of truth? Data risks

BCBS 239 [compliance](http://www.finextra.com/news/announcement.aspx?pressreleaseid=61701) continues to force financial institutions to focus on data.  Specifically, risk-aggregation and risk reporting – linkage of data, all they way to market data used, curve data and more. Effectively its making data a first class citizen in the corporation rather than just a curtesy nod to the topic.  As blogged about some time ago on the subject of asset management, its probably worth looking at [FIBO](http://www.edmcouncil.org/) ontology, specifically around:

*   Regulatory governance
*   Data standardization
*   Risk management
*   Data analytics requirements

Although old, GoldenSource offer the 12 [days](http://www.thegoldensource.com/en/industry-perspectives/blog/432-the-third-day-of-bcbs-239-data-architecturee) of BCBS 239 🙂  Also featured in [TABB](http://tabbforum.com/opinions/the-12-days-of-bcbs-239-day-1-clarity)
