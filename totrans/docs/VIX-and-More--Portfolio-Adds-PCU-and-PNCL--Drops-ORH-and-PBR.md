# VIX and More: Portfolio Adds PCU and PNCL, Drops ORH and PBR

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/07/portfolio-adds-pcu-and-pncl-drops-orh.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/07/portfolio-adds-pcu-and-pncl-drops-orh.html#0001-01-01)

In yet another reminder that this type of portfolio is not aimed at the buy and hold investor, Portfolio A1 has decided to drop [Odyssey Re Holdings (ORH)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=orh&hl=en) and [Petroleo Brasileiro (PBR)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=pbr&hl=en) and replace them with high flying [Southern Copper (PCU)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=pcu&hl=en) and [Pinnacle Airlines (PNCL)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=pncl&hl=en), a regional airline whose [traffic is up 11.2%](http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/marketwire/0275487.htm) so far this year.

Technical and fundamental factors were both in play for this particular portfolio reshuffling.  It was the technical performance (down 8.7% in the four weeks it was in the portfolio) of Odyssey that was its undoing, while PBR suffered from a slight downtick in some fundamental metrics that more than offset a 6.2% gain in the two weeks it has been in the portfolio.

These two changes bump the annual turnover rate in this portfolio up to 415% and send us back to the drawing board to find three stocks that can match the performance and continued promise of stalwarts [Terex (TEX)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=tex&hl=en) and [Amkor Technology (AMKR)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=amkr&hl=en).

There are no other changes to the portfolio for the coming week.

A snapshot of the portfolio is as follows:
