# CFTC / SEC Flash Report | Quantivity

> 来源：[https://quantivity.wordpress.com/2010/10/03/cftc-se-flash-report/#0001-01-01](https://quantivity.wordpress.com/2010/10/03/cftc-se-flash-report/#0001-01-01)

Quantivity recommends reading [Finding Regarding the Market Events of May 6, 2010](http://sec.gov/news/studies/2010/marketevents-report.pdf), in detail. Four thoughts worth pondering during reading, given this lays HFT bare:

*   Veracity: is this report correct and complete?
*   Implications: given obvious front-running, what are the best second-order parasitic algos?
*   Simulation: interesting exercise to simulate this market condition, given the trigger was a simple program order, and back out the *aggregate* HFT algos necessary to generate this market behavior
*   Liquidity: what does liquidity mean in a HFT world, and how should theory be amended commensurately?

This event also demands a collective wish goodbye to orderly price discovery, as this is the ultimate [proof by construction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_proof#Proof_by_construction) of the contrary.

Subsequent posts may comment further, particularly on parasitic algo design. Readers with more inside knowledge are encouraged to comment directly or [contact Quantivity](https://quantivity.wordpress.com/about/) privately.
