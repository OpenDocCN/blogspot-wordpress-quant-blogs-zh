With all the excitement over the performance of [Spain](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Spain)’s soccer team in the World Cup, it has been easy to overlook the performance of the Spanish ETF, [EWP](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EWP). From a low of 29.85 almost a month ago, EWP has now rallied 22.1%, even as the country’s [credit default swaps](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/credit%20default%20swaps) have remained elevated.

As the chart below shows, a close above 37 could signal a new breakout and perhaps a significant uptrend.

More importantly, Spain is the tipping point in the [European sovereign debt crisis](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/European%20sovereign%20debt%20crisis) as I see it. In a nutshell, as goes Spain, so goes Europe.
