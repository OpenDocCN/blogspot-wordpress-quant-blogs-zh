# Quantifiable Edges: This SPX Pattern is Offering Some Compelling Bullish Evidence

> 来源：[http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2011/05/this-spx-pattern-is-offering-some.html#0001-01-01](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2011/05/this-spx-pattern-is-offering-some.html#0001-01-01)

Last night I decided to explore the pattern the SPX has carved out over the last several days. What I noted was that after making a new high it then pulled back for 4 days in a row. That 4 day drop has now been followed by a 3-day rally. At this point the SPX has not managed to overcome the recent highs. So I plugged those observations into a study and found some very compelling results.

While the number of instances was smaller than I would prefer the statistics appear to heavily favor the bull side.
