# VIX and More: Arrow Up For Tomorrow

![](img/0faafa8284d9b0be43e2b22fb1aaafe6.png)I generally shy away from making stock market predictions and prefer the Stuart Walton [jellyfish approach](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/11/quote-for-day-from-stuart-walton.html) to investing, but sometimes the markets get so egregiously out of whack that I feel obliged to state the obvious.  In this case the obvious is that the probability of a short-term rally beginning tomorrow is extremely high.

Many of the overbought/oversold indicators that I study closely ([ISEE](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/ISEE), [TRIN](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TRIN), [VXN](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXN), etc.) suggest that the markets are ready for a bounce tomorrow.  In short, tomorrow is setting up to be a mean reversion, oscillator lover's shooting gallery. Keep in mind, however, that if the markets do not make a U-turn into oncoming traffic, it is often more instructive to observe what the markets fail to do than what they actually end up doing.

In the jellyfish tradition, when a bounce arrives, I have no intention of trying to guess how long it will last.  The important question is whether large investors will be selling into any rally to unload inventory before the bear market grip tightens – or if this may be the beginning of another periodic pullback in the continuing 5 ½ year bull trend.

As always, caveat emptor!
