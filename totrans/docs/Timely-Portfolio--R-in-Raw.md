# Timely Portfolio: R in Raw

> 来源：[http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2013/10/r-in-raw.html#0001-01-01](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2013/10/r-in-raw.html#0001-01-01)

This nice little tool [Raw](http://raw.densitydesign.org/) from DensityDesign transforms text from your clipboard to d3.  For those yearning to access Raw from R, here is an easy way to do it.

Use this function read.excel from StatisticallySignificant’s post [Copying Data from Excel to R and Back](http://alandgraf.blogspot.com/2013/02/copying-data-from-excel-to-r-and-back_24.html).  Once you run the function, your data will be copied tab-delimited to the clipboard.  Then simply paste the data into Raw and make some d3 charts.
