# Humble Student of the Markets: All that's left to do is to wait for Santa Claus

**Mid-week market update**

: Let's begin with an administrative note. In the absence of severe market volatility, this will be the last mid-week market update until the new year. I plan on taking a few days off at the end of the year. I plan to publish the usual two comments this weekend, follow by single comments each weekend after that.

It's always difficult to make definitive market comments on FOMC day, as initial market moves are often reversed on the next day. We can say that the bulls were disappointed by the market reaction to the soft CPI report. The S&P 500 rallied up to test the falling resistance trend line but failed. While the bulls fell short of pushing the index about resistance at 4100, the bears were also unable to push the market below support at 3900\. Tactically, all that's left is to wait for the Santa Claus rally.

2022 has been a difficult year for investors. The silver lining is this environment conducive to tax-loss selling. When the tax-loss sales abate, it becomes a setup for the Santa Claus rally, which begins the day after Christmas and ends the second day of the new year.
