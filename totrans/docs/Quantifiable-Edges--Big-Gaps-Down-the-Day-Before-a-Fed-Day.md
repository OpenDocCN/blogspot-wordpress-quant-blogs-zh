# Quantifiable Edges: Big Gaps Down the Day Before a Fed Day

> 来源：[http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2012/10/big-gaps-down-day-before-fed-day.html#0001-01-01](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2012/10/big-gaps-down-day-before-fed-day.html#0001-01-01)

The pre-market indications are for a gap down of about 1% as I write this around 8:20am EST.  With tomorrow being a Fed Day I decided to see how the market has performed other times it has seen large gaps down on the day prior to a Fed Day.  This first study looks at performance from open to close on the day of the gap down.

Note that the only instance that did NOT gap down

*at least 1%*

was the last one on 12/12/11\.  Instances are low.  Initial returns are mixed with a mild bearish tilt.

Now let’s see what happens if we hold through the Fed Day.

Here we see a big turnaround.  All the 1% gaps down turned net positive from their opens.  And the only instance

*not*

to see a gain of greater than 1% on the Fed Day was the last one (which gapped down less than the others to start). It added to its day 1 losses.
