# Humble Student of the Markets: The 3rd Way in the cyclical/defensive debate

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2013/05/the-3rd-way-in-cyclicaldefensive-debate.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2013/05/the-3rd-way-in-cyclicaldefensive-debate.html#0001-01-01)

Here's a thought. About a month ago, I wondered out loud that whether the defensive sector rally could be better characterized as the outperformance of Value over Growth stocks (see A

[Value rally, or a defensive sector rally?](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2013/04/a-value-rally-or-defensive-sector-rally.html)

)

Now that cyclical (and growth oriented) sectors have surged relative to the defensive sectors, the Value stocks have similarly pulled back against Growth stocks. The chart below of the Russell 1000 Value Index relative to the Russell 1000 Growth Index shows that the relative uptrend of Value vs. Growth is still intact.

If my analysis of Value vs. Growth is the more appropriate framework, then it may be time to start buying Value now (and it may represent the third way in the cyclical vs. defensive sector debate of whether the cyclical rebound is a fakeout or true revival).
