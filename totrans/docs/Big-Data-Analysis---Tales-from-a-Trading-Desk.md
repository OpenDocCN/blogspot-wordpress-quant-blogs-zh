## Big Data Analysis

Firmex provides a nice [list](http://www.firmex.com/blog/7-big-data-techniques-that-create-business-value/) of big data analysis techniques which correlate well to my last posting on machine learning.  It’s also of no surprise in Firmex’s follow-on article about open source big data tools to see [Storm](http://www.firmex.com/blog/big-data-3-open-source-tools-to-know/) mentioned.  Gaining insight from data is key.  Insight can only be gained from data that is clean and valuable – slide [26](http://www.slideshare.net/larsga/introduction-to-big-datamachine-learning).
