# VIX and More: CXO Advisory Group on CBOE Put to Call Ratio and ISEE

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/05/cxo-advisory-group-on-cboe-put-to-call.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/05/cxo-advisory-group-on-cboe-put-to-call.html#0001-01-01)

Yesterday, the [CXO Advisory Group](http://www.cxoadvisory.com/) published an analysis of the CBOE total (index plus equity) put to call ratio, looking out at 5, 21 and 63 day time horizons. They concluded that relative to the S&P 500 index data, the CBOE total put to call ratio is "[not a useful indicator for short-term or intermediate-term trading](http://www.cxoadvisory.com/blog/internal/blog5-08-07/)" and found that the put to call numbers are more likely to lag rather than lead the S&P 500 data.

In a follow-up piece this morning, the folks at CXO examined the ISEE data in a similar fashion. While they found a stronger relationship between the ISEE and the S&P 500 index, they expressed concern about the sample size in the course of concluding that the ISEE "[may offer a slight edge for intermediate trading](http://www.cxoadvisory.com/blog/internal/blog5-09-07/)," particularly at the 63 day horizon.

My suggestion is that you read both of the CXO articles in full and take a look at my comments about the usefulness of the [ISEE 50 day simple moving average](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/03/simple-moving-averages-and-isee.html) and Bernie Schaeffer's [recent comments and charts](http://www.schaeffersresearch.com/plus/bgscommentary.aspx?click=home&ID=18658) regarding the CBOE equity put to call ratio. Of the three CBOE put to call measures (index, equity, and total put to call ratios), I put considerably more stock in the equity variant, which tracks most closely to the ISEE.

I will have more to say about the ISEE and the CBOE put to call ratios in the future. While I believe that following these ratios is a worthwhile endeavor for gauging investor sentiment, I strongly suggest that they not be the only arrow in your quiver.
