## What happened to StreamInsight CTP1?

I figured out what happened to StreamInsight CTP1\. Looking back at [Torsten Grabs](//www.msteched.com/sessionlist/default.aspx) TechEd 2009 presentation “Low-Latency Event Processing with Microsoft’s Platform for CEP”, there never was a TAP CTP1\. CTP1 must have been a very private release.
