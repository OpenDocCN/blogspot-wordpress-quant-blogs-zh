The SPX closed lower by 3% today.

[I’ve looked at drops of 5% or more](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2008/12/5-drops-revisited.html)

in depth in the last few months and found there to be a tendency for a short-term bounce following such steep drops.

Tonight I decided to see how drops between 2.5% and 5% have fared since the beginning of the bear market.

In these cases further downside was more common.  84% of instances closed below the trigger price at some point in the next 3 days.
