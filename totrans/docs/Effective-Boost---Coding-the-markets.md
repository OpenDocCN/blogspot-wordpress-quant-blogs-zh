## Effective Boost

### May 1, 2008

I’ve long been a fan of [Scott Meyer](http://www.aristeia.com)‘s [Effective C++](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321334876), [More Effective C++](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/020163371X) and [Effective STL](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201749629) series of books. I have a 1992 first edition of Effective C++ on my desk that’s been very well thumbed. Today I asked a colleague who’s a heavy hitting C++ expert for Boost book recommendation. He suggested [Karlsson’s book](http://www.amazon.com/Beyond-C%2B%2B-Standard-Library-Introduction/dp/0321133544), which looks OK. But we really need Scott to write a book on Boost. Bring it on please Scott !!
