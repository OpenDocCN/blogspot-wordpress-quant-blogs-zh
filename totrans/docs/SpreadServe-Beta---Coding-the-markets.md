## SpreadServe Beta

### December 6, 2014

For the last few months I’ve been working on a new product: [SpreadServe](http://spreadserve.com "SpreadServe"). [SpreadServe’s mission](http://spreadserve.com/about/ "Our mission") is to take all those unwieldy spreadsheets full of XLL addins and VBA macros off trader desktops, and turn them into resilient, automated, scalable enterprise services. Excel spreadsheets are great, because they empower users to create their own solutions quickly. But on the other hand, they’re a liability, because they’re usually poorly tested and they have to be manually operated on the desktop. SpreadServe’s goal is to fix that by providing an alternate runtime for Excel spreadsheets. Retain business agility by continuing to design and build models in Excel. Auto-test, deploy, scale, log and automate those models in SpreadServe. Do [contact](http://spreadserve.com/contact/ "Contact") [us](http://spreadserve.com/about/team/ "The team") if you’re interested in joining the beta program.
