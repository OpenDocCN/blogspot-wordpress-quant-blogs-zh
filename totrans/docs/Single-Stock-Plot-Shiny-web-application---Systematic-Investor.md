## Single Stock Plot Shiny web application

Today, I want to share the [Single Stock Plot](http://glimmer.rstudio.com/systematicin/one.stock/) application (code at [GitHub](https://github.com/systematicinvestor/SIT/tree/master/Shiny/one.stock)).

This is the first application in the series of examples (I plan to share 5 examples) that will demonstrate the amazing [Shiny](http://www.rstudio.com/shiny/) framework and [Systematic Investor Toolbox](https://systematicinvestor.wordpress.com/systematic-investor-toolbox/) to analyze stocks, make back-tests, and create summary reports.

The motivation for this series of posts is to show how to translate, with minimal effort, your back-test scripts into live web applications that can either be run from the Shiny server or your personal computer.

I will post the second example application tomorrow.
