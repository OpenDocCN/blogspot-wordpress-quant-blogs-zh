# Humble Student of the Markets: Tame inflation? Don't get complacent!

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2018/05/tame-inflation-dont-get-complacent.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2018/05/tame-inflation-dont-get-complacent.html#0001-01-01)

The Treasury market rallied last week when the 10-year Treasury yield tested the 3% level and pulled back.

The decline in yields (and bond prices rally) was not a big surprise for a number of reasons:

*   10-year yields (TNX) was exhibiting a negative RSI divergence
*   A tamer than expected Consumer Price Index
*   Hedge funds were in a crowded short in the 10-year T-Note and T-Bond futures

While the bond market rally is likely to have a bit more leg over the next few weeks, my inclination is to enjoy the party, but don't overstay the festivities.
