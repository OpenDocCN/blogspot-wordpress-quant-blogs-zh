# Falkenblog: BSDs Take Note

Many tell all books by ex-Wall Streeters note the macho culture among traders (mainly, market makers and brokers). Get a bunch of 20-something guys in a room all day, and its kind of inevitable. The temperament of traders, as opposed to IT guys, suggests they probably have higher-than-average levels of testosterone.

Clearly macho behavior can go too far, and a civilized society should discourage rudeness because real diversity is about treating everyone as a person with as much dignity as yourself (as opposed to 'celebrating' differences). On the other hand, taking these issues to court is a poor way to handle one's umbrage. Take the

[case](http://www.nydailynews.com/money/2009/01/29/2009-01-29_wall_streeter_sues_employer_over_vegetar.html)

of Ryan Pacifico who is suing Calyon, charging that his one-time boss at the French financial firm mocked him for avoiding meat and wearing snug-fitting shorts during triathlons:

> Catalanello's alleged abuse is the meat of the nine-page complaint, which accuses the boss of saying, "Who the f--- cares?" when another trader questioned what Pacifico would eat during an outing to a steakhouse.
> 
> "It's his fault for being a vegetarian homo," Catalanello is accused of saying.
> 
> "You don't even eat steak, dude," Catalanello is accused of saying. "At what point in time did you realize you were gay?"

It's such an adolescent jab, it would be hard to get too worked up about it. Even if I were gay, I think I would laugh at the sheer immaturity of the comment (does any slam with 'dude' at the end sting?). Best to shrug it off, and order a salad at the steak retreat, with lots of wine. Politeness is two sided: not giving unintentional offenses, and not being too thin skinned.

And wearing snug-fitting bicycle shorts is kinda asking for the equivalent of an office wedgie.
