# Quantifiable Edges: When SPY Gaps Up 1% And Closes Negative

What stood out to me about Monday was the fact that the market gapped higher by such a large amount and failed to close positive on the day. Below I look at other times the SPY gapped up 1% and finished negative.

While instances are a bit low, additional downside follow through was often seen over the next 1-3 days.
