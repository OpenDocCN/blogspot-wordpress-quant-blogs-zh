Going through some of the reading from SIA. Tons and tons of stuff out there. On my "to-learn" list are:

- market data definition language, yet another XML-based way of transmitting financial info

[Gigaspaces](http://www.gigaspaces.com/)

- grid-based infrastructure

[Vhayu](http://www.vhayu.com)

- real-time and historical data storage with real-time calculations and event broadcasting

[Wombat](http://www.wombatfs.com/)

- another high-speed market data and messaging platform
