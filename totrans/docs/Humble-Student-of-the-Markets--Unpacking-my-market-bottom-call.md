# Humble Student of the Markets: Unpacking my market bottom call

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2022/06/unpacking-my-market-bottom-call.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2022/06/unpacking-my-market-bottom-call.html#0001-01-01)

**Mid-week market update**

: My last publication (see

[Why last week may have been THE BOTTOM](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2022/06/20/why-last-week-may-have-been-the-bottom/)

) certainly caused some contraversy. Why I am making no promises about the future, I turned cautiously bullish on February 25, 2008, just a week before the generational March 2009 bottom (see

[Phoenix rising?](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2009/02/phoenix-rising.html)

). 

In that post, I postulated that the market was sufficiently washed out that it was time to dip your toe into the water with speculative Phoenix stocks, low-priced stocks that had fallen dramatically and saw significant insider buying. The good news is the timing of the call was nearly perfect, it came a week before the ultimate low. The bad news is the S&P 500 fell another -8% before the market finally bottomed.

Nobody's perfect.
