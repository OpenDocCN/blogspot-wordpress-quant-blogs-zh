# VIX and More: Portfolio A1 Seeing All Green

On the heels of last week’s [lackluster performance](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/06/selloff-tests-portfolio-a1.html), the portfolio roared to life this week, with all five of Portfolio A1’s holdings logging weekly gains.  This enabled Portfolio A1 to stretch its performance margin over the benchmark S&P 500 from 1.7% to the current 4.2%.

Note that [Tesoro (TSO)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=tso&hl=en) paid out a dividend of $0.10 on Friday.  In keeping with the [precedent](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/05/portfolio-a1-holds-steady-as-rkt-loses.html) established with the treatment of an earlier [Rock-Tenn (RKT)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=rkt&hl=en) dividend, I am automatically reinvesting the cash proceeds into the appropriate stock.

Once again, there are no changes to the portfolio for the coming week.

A snapshot of the portfolio is as follows:
