## Research

I want to introduce the [Systematic Portfolio](http://www.systematicportfolio.com) Research company.

I will publish my research at [Systematic Portfolio](http://www.systematicportfolio.com) site. For example, [Relative Market View](http://www.systematicportfolio.com/research) report is a daily report that is published every night that shows relative US Sectors performance for the last year.

I will post tools that I develop at [Systematic Portfolio](http://www.systematicportfolio.com) site. For example, you can download and use [Seasonality Tool](http://www.systematicportfolio.com/tools) to study historical seasonality, to decide which months are historically profitable, to find when during the month is historically best time to buy or sell.

Please visit the [Systematic Portfolio](http://www.systematicportfolio.com) site to view my research and download my tools. For any questions related to the [Systematic Portfolio](http://www.systematicportfolio.com) site, please contact me at SystematicPortfolio at gmail.
