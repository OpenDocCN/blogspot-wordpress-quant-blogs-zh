# Quantifiable Edges: What Recent Moves Up Suggests About The Pullback That Began On Friday

Strong, persistent moves often do not roll over immediately.  Real persistency can set up a situation where strength begets more strength.  An example of that concept was triggered with Friday’s setup, where we had the 1st down day after 5 consecutive higher closes.

Initially there appears to be a moderate inclination for a bounce.  Once you get out 9-10 days the upside edge appears very substantial.  Based on this, there appears a good chance that the dip that started Friday may not get too far before the market again moves higher.
