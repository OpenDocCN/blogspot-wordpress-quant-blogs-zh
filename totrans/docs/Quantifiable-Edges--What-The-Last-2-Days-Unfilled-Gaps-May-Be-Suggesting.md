# Quantifiable Edges: What The Last 2 Days Unfilled Gaps May Be Suggesting

I am seeing a real mix of evidence right now, as neither bullish nor bearish short-term evidence is dominating.  The study below is one example of a study from last night’s letter with possible bearish implications. It examines 2-day moves like SPY has just encountered.

The suggestion here is that more downside appears likely over the next few days.
