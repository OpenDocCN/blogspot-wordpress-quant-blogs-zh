# Quantifiable Edges: We-versal Wednesday?

Going into the day yesterday we had a Turnaround Tuesday setup.  When the market is down 3 days in a row going into a Tuesday, it has had a strong tendency to bounce.  Of course there have been instances over the years where it hasn’t.  And yesterday was one.  When it doesn’t rise on Tuesday what does that mean for Wednesday and beyond?  Though it has appeared in

numerous times over the years, I have not shown the test below on the blog since

[August of 2012](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2010/08/no-turnaround-tuesdayhow-about.html)

.  It answers that "Wednesday & beyond" question.

Results here have been very strong over a long period.  It seems the Turnaround Tuesday failure has typically been a temporary setback.
