## MSFT Stephen Toub – TPL Dataflow in Financial Services

Back in October 2010 Stephen Toub dropped me an email which spiked my interest around Axum, CCR, Task Parallel Library and DSS and a new library Microsoft was developing – what we know as the [TPL Dataflow](http://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Going+Deep/Stephen-Toub-Inside-TPL-Dataflow) today. With each CTP Refresh released by Stephen and the Microsoft team, Lab49 has attempted to provide valuable feedback to assist Microsoft in its footprint of .NET within financial services. As highlighted by the talk I gave at the Waters conference in New York last week (picked up by Stephen’s blog posting [here](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/pfxteam/archive/2011/05/02/10160221.aspx)) its nice to see that through a combinations of Lab49 build, Solace Systems hardware and Microsoft’s .NET libraries a valid financial services low latency applications can be built and show to a public audience.
