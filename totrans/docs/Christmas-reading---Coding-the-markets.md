## Christmas reading

### January 5, 2008

I guess I was a good boy last year, as Fr Christmas bought me a [mini-V S37](http://www.vyepc.com/?sec=1&prd=3), [Bloomberg by Bloomberg](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Bloomberg-Michael/dp/0471208884), [Fooled by Randomness](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Fooled-Randomness-Hidden-Chance-Markets/dp/0141031484) and [The Truth about Markets](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Truth-About-Markets-Countries-Others/dp/0140296727). I’ve read [Taleb](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassim_Taleb)‘s book twice before, this copy’s for reference. Kay’s book on markets is an economic polemic, rather than being about any specific financial market. Bloomberg’s book is readable, entertaining and somewhat informative, but a little frustrating.

Some of the usual suspects show up in Bloomberg’s book: [Gutfreund](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gutfreund), for instance. There’s some interesting detail on Bloomberg’s early career at Salomon. Also good coverage of Bloomberg’s first deal with Merrill, differentiation from Reuters and Dow Jones by providing historical data and analytics as well as raw pricing data, and bulding an information business generally. Bloomberg’s comments on the excellence of his company’s customer service are inadvertently funny. And he does blow his own trumpet somewhat. Mildly, not strongly, recommended.
