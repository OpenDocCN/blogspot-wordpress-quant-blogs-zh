Moments ago the VIX spiked to 38.32, the highest VIX level recorded in the past six years surpassing the 37.57 [VIX spike](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20spikes) back on [January 22nd](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/01/brunhilde-day-today.html).

With the weekend coming up and so much uncertainty in the markets, I am concerned that we may still be several sessions away from a [Brunhilde Day](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Brunhilde%20Day). On the other hand, a strong finish today on impressive volume and lots of breadth would help to make the case for an intermediate-term bottom.
