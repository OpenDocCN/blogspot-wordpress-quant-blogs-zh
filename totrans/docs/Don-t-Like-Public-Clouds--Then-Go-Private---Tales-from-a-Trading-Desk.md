## Don’t Like Public Clouds? Then Go Private

Microsoft provides its [Private Cloud](http://www.microsoft.com/virtualization/en/us/private-cloud.aspx) view of the world at [TechEd](http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2010/nov10/11-08MSTEEPR.mspx?rss_fdn=Press%20Releases) Europe 2010\. Private clouds can either be setup within your own data center or hosted by a service [provider](http://www.microsoft.com/virtualization/en/us/hyperv-cloud-service-providers.aspx).
