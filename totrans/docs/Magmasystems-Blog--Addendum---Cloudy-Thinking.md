# Magmasystems Blog: Addendum - Cloudy Thinking

> 来源：[http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2008/04/addendum-cloudy-thinking.html#0001-01-01](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2008/04/addendum-cloudy-thinking.html#0001-01-01)

In my

previous

post, I don't think that I stated my question properly.

I was asking how to actually implement the Event Cloud in a Streaming

SQL

-like

CEP

engine, so that we can build up hierarchies of events. I was looking for

schemas

,

SQL

statements, best practices, etc.

I am well aware of POSETS, but what might be easy to implement in C# or Java-based data structures is not that easy in a quasi-relational system such as CORAL8.

So, I was hunting for advice from people who might have implemented event clouds in Coral8, Streambase, and Aleri, all three which are based on SQL.

I will follow up this post with a more concrete example.
