[Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-23/harvard-s-reinhart-warns-hong-kong-could-trigger-world-recession)

reported that Carmen Reinhart had a chilling warning about Hong Kong:

> Hong Kong’s rolling political turmoil could prove a tipping point for the world economy, Harvard University economist Carmen Reinhart said.
> 
> Noting an incidence of shocks that have rattled global growth, including the intensifying U.S.-China trade war, Reinhart cited Hong Kong as among her main concerns. Having previously warned that Hong Kong faces a housing bubble, she said the world economy could be hit by “shocks with a bang or with a whisper.”
> 
> “One shock that is concerning me a great deal at the moment is the turmoil in Hong Kong,” which could impact growth in China and Asia generally, Reinhart said in an interview with Bloomberg Television’s Kathleen Hays.
> 
> “These are not segmented regional effects, these have really global consequences. So what could be a tipping point that could trigger a very significant global slowdown, or even recession -- that would be a candidate, that could be a candidate,” said Reinhart, who specializes in international finance.

Indeed, the unrest has taken a toll on the local economy.

...and GDP growth expectations are tanking.

Let me calm everyone down, and you can timestamp this forecast.

***China will not send the troops into Hong Kong in 2019, which reduces tail-risk***

. At the same time, however, investors should not ignore Carmen Reinhart's warnings either.
