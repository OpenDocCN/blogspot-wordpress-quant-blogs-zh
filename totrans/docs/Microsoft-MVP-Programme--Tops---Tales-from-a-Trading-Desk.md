## Microsoft MVP Programme: Tops

Being an [MVP](http://mvp.support.microsoft.com/) means that I get early access to certain Microsoft new technologies – for me this is the coolest thing about being an MVP. The only MVP downside I’ve had so far is the “interesting” design of the top that I recently received with appropriate “The Microsoft MVP Programme: Independent Experts. Real World Answers” logo and colours 😦 – not something I’d want to wear outside a dark room.
