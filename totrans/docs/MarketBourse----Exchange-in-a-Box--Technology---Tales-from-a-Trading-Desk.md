## MarketBourse – ‘Exchange in a Box’ Technology

A few months old, but from [Trade News](http://thetradenews.com/news/People/Mackay_targets_2013_launch_of_MarketBourse.aspx):

> The core idea behind [MarketBourse](http://www.wbresearch.com/tradetechfx/Alternative_Trading_Systems.aspx) is to let traders share trading [information](http://www.thetradenews.com/newsarticle.aspx?id=8576) in circles of other market participants they select, similar to choosing friends on social networking platforms. The functionality would allow members to minimise market impact by selecting who they trade with.

The exchange in a box [offering](http://www.wbresearch.com/tradingarchitecture/Presentations.aspx) has been designed to give buy-side firms the ability to decide when they want to interact with proprietary and client flow from broker crossing networks.

> “In many ways this is can act as a virtual broker crossing network – the bank or broker won’t need to run their own crossing network as this will do it for them at a fraction of the cost,” Mackay said. “We are hoping that getting the ‘exchange in a box’ technology into some big financial institutions will help the roll out of the second phase where we go into non-equity products,” Mackay said.

Maybe the User Experience will also be 3D?

> Our technology makes the market 3D in that users can configure what they see from other people and what other people see of them. Layer on top of that the ability to have the same order in multiple types of market – such as central limit order book, call and quote driven,” Mackay said.
