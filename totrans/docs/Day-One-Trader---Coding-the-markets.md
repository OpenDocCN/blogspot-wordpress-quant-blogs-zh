## Day One Trader

### January 21, 2011

At the moment I’m enjoying John Sussex’s career memoir [Day One Trader](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Day-One-Trader-Liffe-Story/dp/0470741732). He stumbled into the City as a 16 year old Essex lad, and ended up on the board of LIFFE. I’m interested in exchange trading, and there’s lots of good anecdotage on how brokers, dealers and locals worked order on the floor. I’m looking forward to Sussex’s account of the late 90s, and the battle with Eurex and the development of LIFFE Connect.
