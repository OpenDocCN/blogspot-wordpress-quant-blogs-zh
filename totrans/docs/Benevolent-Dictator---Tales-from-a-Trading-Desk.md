# Benevolent Dictator | Tales from a Trading Desk

> 来源：[https://mdavey.wordpress.com/2013/02/06/benevolent-dictator/#0001-01-01](https://mdavey.wordpress.com/2013/02/06/benevolent-dictator/#0001-01-01)

One thing you learn from sitting on a (front office) desk, is that you need to make decisions, and move forwards.  This decision process, leads to an interesting article [titled](http://www.itbusinessedge.com/cm/blogs/tennant/the-argument-for-benevolent-dictatorship-in-decision-making/?cs=48212) “The Argument for ‘Benevolent Dictatorship’ in Decision-making”.  Personally, I can relate to the seven tips in the article, as I am sure a few others (readers?) can 😉  Tip 4 should possible be a rule 😉  The last of the 7 tips probably should be though about in the context of “vision” – see earlier blog posting.

So back to dictators, and the Neal Whitten Group again has an interesting [article](http://nealwhittengroup.com/articles/are-you-a-benevolent-dictator-you-should-be/), “Are You a Benevolent [Dictator](http://theweek.com/article/index/215121/fortunes-apple-expos-steve-jobs-is-a-dictator-and-3-other-takeaways)? You Should Be!”.  Specifically,

> Micromanaging occurs when a leader chooses to make decisions for anyone and everyone within his or her influence

The Neal article also provides this food for thought:

> Personal commitment is when you, personally, are charged with making a decision and then you are held accountable for the outcome of that decision.

[Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/joshbersin/2012/07/30/its-not-the-ceo-its-the-leadership-strategy-that-matters/) has an article not specifically on dictators, but the Three Fundamentals Of Effective [Leadership](http://www.forbes.com/2009/04/29/vision-communication-judgment-leadership-managing-ccl.html).  As per an earlier blog posting, this article highlights vision as being key – obvious really.

As I was googling in an airport lounge, I came across a rather old [article](http://www.howatthr.com/images/pdf/enhancingdna/A%20Leadership%20Guide%20for%20Building%20a%20Positive%20Corporate%20Culture.pdf), A Leadership Guide for Building a Positive Corporate Culture In Times of Growth and Expansion.  Of interest was the quote:

> Aim for success, not perfection.

That simple sentence above, has a lot of bearing on the solutions software engineers deliver today due to in part, the lack of understanding a vision, and the understanding of decision making.

White Spaces also offers a  read on benevolent dictators, What’s Wrong With Being a Benevolent Dictator?  The take away from this article:

> (Benevolent dictators) also show a readiness to act decisively even in desperate situations knowing the buck stops with them. This only works if a leader is respected. Respect doesn’t happen overnight but is built over time by proving personal capability and commitment. It doesn’t automatically come with a job title, nor should it.

Final thought before I get on another plane – The Benevolent [Dictator](http://www.amazon.com/Benevolent-Dictator-Employees-Business-Competition/dp/1118003918): Empower Your Employees, Build Your Business, and Outwit the Competition.  Not read the book myself yet, but it could be worth a read given the reviews.
