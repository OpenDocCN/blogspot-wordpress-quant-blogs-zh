# 2014 – Sniper In Mahwah & friends

> 来源：[https://sniperinmahwah.wordpress.com/2014/01/08/2014/#0001-01-01](https://sniperinmahwah.wordpress.com/2014/01/08/2014/#0001-01-01)

Happy New Year everyboby!

I have a hard time finishing my new little book about hft (the sequel of [the first one](http://www.zones-sensibles.org/index.php?mod=auteurs&a=06)), which is due to be released in March. So, this blog will be quite silent until mid-February – even if two posts about IEX are in progress, and a short one will be published in the next few days about the [Modern Markets Initiative](http://modernmarketsinitiative.org/).
