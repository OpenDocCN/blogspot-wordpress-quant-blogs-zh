# Quantifiable Edges: Poor Breadth On Bounce Somewhat Discouraging

I’ve shown numerous studies over the last couple of years that illustrate weak bounces from oversold conditions are often followed by downside.

A study that appeared in last night’s Quantifinder is an example of this. The study was last shown in the 6/24/09 blog post and is updated below:

Notable about the above study is that 4 of the last 5 instances showed positive returns 5 days out. The one instance that never closed below the entry was the last instance on 11/2/09\. Still, the stats are convincing enough that I’m not inclined to completely ignore them.
