# VIX and More: VXX Weeklys Begin Trading Tomorrow

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/08/vxx-weeklys-begin-trading-tomorrow.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/08/vxx-weeklys-begin-trading-tomorrow.html#0001-01-01)

Thanks to a tweet from Adam Warner of the [Daily Options Report](http://www.dailyoptionsreport.com/) for alerting me to the fact that [VXX options](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX%20options) have just been added to the list of 28 indices, ETFs and stocks on which the CBOE is now trading [weekly options](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/weekly), or as the exchange calls them, weeklys.

The [VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX) ETF and VXX options are two subjects I have covered in considerable detail over the course of the past two years, so rather than repeat myself, I will encourage readers to start with the links to older posts on the subject toward the bottom of this post or refer to the keyword links herein and labels at the very bottom of this post.

Weekly options are the new kid on the block and something I jumped on early and have enjoyed, particularly as someone who has been an aggressive seller of options over the course of the last 1 ½ years. Again, there are links above and below for readers to find some of what I have said on the subject to date.

I should also note, however, that the August issue of [*Expiring Monthly: The Option Traders Journal*](http://www.expiringmonthly.com/) (published on Monday) has three articles on weekly options, including a guest article from Vance Harwood of the [Six Figure Investing](http://sixfigureinvesting.com/blog/) blog. Farther afield, [Steven Sears](http://topics.barrons.com/person/S/steven-sears/6043?mod=BOL_hpp_tnav_columnist) of Barron’s tackles the subject of weeklys in today’s The Striking Price column: [The Weeklys Get Stronger](http://online.barrons.com/article/SB50001424052970204313804575451491056271812.html).

Below I have included a watch list I set up on [Livevol Pro](http://www.livevolpro.com/) that has this week’s 28 weekly options plus next week’s addition, VXX, sorted by call volume. Note that VXX replaces Dendreon ([DNDN](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/DNDN)) and brings the current breakdown of weeklys to 12 equities, 11 ETFs and 5 indices.
