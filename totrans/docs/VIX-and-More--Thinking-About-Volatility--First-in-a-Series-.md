# VIX and More: Thinking About Volatility (First in a Series)

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/02/thinking-about-volatility-first-in.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/02/thinking-about-volatility-first-in.html#0001-01-01)

Lately I have been fielding a large number of questions about historical volatility, implied volatility and a variety of related subjects. For this reason, it seems like a good time to kick off what I envision as a series of [educational](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/educational) posts on the subject.

First I would like to start out with my own definition of volatility and then throw out some thought starters.

> Definition: *Volatility* is a measure of the degree of change in the price of a security

There are a number of ways to think about changes in the price of a security. For instance, changes in price may be described in terms of:

*   ***magnitude*** (amplitude) – how far?
*   ***frequency*** – how often?
*   ***duration*** – how long?
*   ***trend*** – unidirectional or choppy?
*   ***direction*** – up or down?

In terms of measurement, common ways to measure price changes include:

*   ***close to close***
*   ***open to close*** (intra-bar; excludes gaps)
*   ***bar to bar maximum*** (e.g. [Average True Range](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/average%20true%20range))

Of course each investor has their preferred unit of time, with each bar representing a minute, five minutes, one day or whatever.

By convention, most investors think of volatility in terms of changes in price, but I submit that volatility be measured in the following units:

*   ***points***
*   ***percentage*** (of price)
*   ***standard deviations***

Looking back at the definition, I sometimes like to think of volatility more broadly than I have formally defined it. Consider that volatility can be defined in terms of:

*   ***price***
*   ***volume***
*   ***trend*** (degree of trending vs. choppiness)

Finally, consider that once measured, volatility can be compared to a number of possible benchmarks. These include:

*   ***external aggregate*** (broad index)
*   ***relative to peers*** (sector index, sector ETF, other representative ETF)
*   ***relative to self*** (including historical volatility and prior implied volatility levels)

I will touch upon all these subjects and more in the coming days and weeks.
