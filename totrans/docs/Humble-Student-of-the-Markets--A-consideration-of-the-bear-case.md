# Humble Student of the Markets: A consideration of the bear case

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2015/01/a-consideration-of-bear-case.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2015/01/a-consideration-of-bear-case.html#0001-01-01)

We also have to consider two factors that exacerbate the magnitude of bear markets. Those are the presence of excessive leverage and high valuation. The NASDAQ bubble that ended in 2000 was financed mainly by equity with little leverage and therefore the ensuing economic damage was relatively contained. By contrast, the 2008 downturn was financed by excessive leverage caused by real estate speculation. That result was a global financial crisis that the world is still trying to recover from, seven years later.

Similarly, unreal market valuations can cause a minor market crack to cascade into a major bear market. In 1987, the Fed tightened into a market crash. In 2000, the withdrawal of Y2K liquidity may have been the spark that ended the NASDAQ bubble.

**No recession in sight**

Fortunately, we can rule out the possibility of a recession.

[New Deal Democrat](http://community.xe.com/blog/xe-market-analysis/2015-forecast-us-economy-positive-watch-washington-and-oil)

has done excellent work in this area. In addition,

[Jeff Miller](http://dashofinsight.com/)

watches a number of pundits and indicators, none of which are showing a recession risk. The US economy remains in the mid-cycle phase of an expansion.

**Tight money: It`s all about earnings growth**

Tight money, which is one of Rosenberg's causes of bear markets, is a concern as the Fed prepares to hike interest rates in mid-2015\. In the past, however, the first rate hike has not sparked bear markets as the negative effects of rising interest rates have been offset by the positive effects of an acceleration in economic growth.

In the current instance, the market cannot expect much downside support from valuation. Multiples are elevated, though not stupidly high as they were in 1987 or 2000\. However, James Paulsen of

[Wells Capital Management](http://wellscap.com/docs/emp/20150108.pdf)

makes a case that valuations are dangerously high. Here is the chart of trailing PE, which shows my interpretation that market valuations are elevated but not excessive:

Instead of analyzing the capitalization weighted PE ratio, Paulsen showed that the median PE of US stocks is at a record level:

The median PB ratio is also highly stretched:

Unlike the Tech Bubble, where the excessive valuation was concentrated in only a few sectors, Paulsen warned that stock are expensive across the board, which is a more insidious form of over-valuation:

> Is the current widespread valuation extreme more dangerous than a concentrated extreme simply because concentrated extremes tend to be more obvious and eye-catching? A concentrated valuation extreme tends to loudly announce itself whereas a broad-based valuation extreme seems more stealth and, therefore, perhaps more dangerous.

Paulsen's analysis of historically high PE ratios is confirmed by Goldman Sachs, who analyzed forward PE ratios instead of trailing PEs. The team at Goldman Sachs indicated that current SPX forward PE of 16.7 is high by historical standards, but the median forward PE of 17.6 is even higher as it in the top 2% of history from 1976.

I would temper those alarmist remarks by pointing out that both inflation and interest rates are very low compared to the study period shown by Paulsen and Goldman Sachs. While market multiples aren`t low by historical standards, stocks can continue to rise as long as earnings continue to rise. The analysis from Wells Capital Management showed that the market was expensive in 2005 across the board as well, but the market did not peak several years later. The grey bars depict the PE valuation percentiles (a low percentile is expensive compared to its own history) in 2005 and the black bars in 2014.

Here is Paulsen`s caveat:

> The 2005 stock market also exhibited excessive valuations across all P/E percentiles. However, the stock market did not suffer any major decline until almost three years later (and from higher levels) in 2008.

In the end, earnings matter as much as PE multiples. I am therefore watching carefully how forward EPS estimates change in the near future. This chart from John Butters at Factset (annotations in red are mine) show that past pauses in EPS growth have coincided with either corrections or bear markets. I believe that forward EPS should get revised upwards soon because of the boost from lower oil prices, but we need to see how that evolves as I am cognizant of the fact that US large caps are vulnerable to the negative effects of a rising USD (see my recent post

[Focus on small caps in 2015](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2015/01/focus-on-small-caps-in-2015.html)

):

**Financial dislocation: Always a wildcard**

The third cause of a bear market has been a financial dislocation somewhere in the world sparking a financial crisis. Not all financial crisis spread and cause bear markets. For example, the market shrugged off the Dubai default of 2010, which occurred during a period when the financial system was still frail from the Lehman Crisis of 2008.

The most likely sources of financial crisis and contagion are China and Europe. China has always been a wildcard, largely because its economy is so opaque. I believe that China risks are relatively low in the medium term as the current regime has undertaken to enact reforms. Should the Chinese economy really tank, Beijing have also shown the flexibility to stimulate and kick the can down the road. That strategy works as long as the road is long - and it seems to be at the moment.

The bigger risk of financial crisis and contagion comes from Europe, but the source is not as obvious as the headlines show. While the Greece-Germany-ECB tug of war will continue to be a source of drama for months to come, it is the usual European theatre and noise that can be safely ignored. The parents fight and the kids hear everything, but in the end they still want to stay married.

The biggest source of worry is the British election scheduled in May. As I pointed out before (see

[2015: Bullish skies with periods of volatility](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2014/12/2015-bullish-skies-with-scattered.html)

), that election has the potential to shatter the British social compact and render the UK ungovernable. Here is the warning from

[Anatole Kaletsky](http://blogs.reuters.com/anatole-kaletsky/2014/11/21/britain-may-turn-into-europes-most-politically-unpredictable-country/)

 (emphasis added):

> ***Britain could become literally ungovernable after the election, with no single party or coalition of parties able to form a majority government.*** Current public opinion polls predict that neither the Conservatives nor the Labour Party will win enough seats to form a majority government — even in a coalition with Liberal Democrats.
> 
> Conservative-Liberal and Labour-Liberal majorities may both prove arithmetically impossible because of the rise of previously insignificant fringe parties. ***The Scottish Nationalists look able to boost their six seats in Parliament to anything between 20 and 50, largely at Labour’s expense. The United Kingdom Independence Party is threatening dozens of Conservative incumbents.*** Meanwhile, the Liberals are almost certain to lose about half their 56-seat representation. As a result, ***a ruling coalition may have to include not just two parties but three or four, including fringe nationalist groups.***
> 
> ***The Scottish National Party is sure to demand another Scottish independence referendum as its price for supporting a coalition, while the UK Independent Party will likely insist on Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union.*** It is hard to imagine either Labour or Conservatives agreeing to such terms.
> 
> This means that a government may have to be formed without a majority in Parliament. While minority governments are quite common in continental Europe, the British Parliament has only once failed to produce a government majority — during a brief interlude in 1974 under Harold Wilson. It created seismic upheavals in Britain’s adversarial politics.

The presence of fringe parties like the Scottish National Party or UKIP in the government will raise the specter of another Scottish referendum, or worse, the risk of Brexit from the EU. While the political commitment of the European elite is very much pro-Europe, there is no such consensus from the British.

The mere whiff of the possibility of Brexit would put into question of not just the euro, but the European Union. Such political instability in a major trading bloc would raise risk premiums around the world. Moreover, this scenario is not on the radar screen of most market analysts and strategists and would be a major shock to the financial system.

Should such a scenario unfold, the good news is that the bear market is likely to be short and sharp, much like the Russia and LTCM Crisis or the Crash of 1987, rather than long and drawn out like a recessionary bear market like 1980-82\. For buy-and-hold investors who can keep their nerve and maintain their investment, that would be good news. It means that if you blink and ignore the downturn, you would barely feel its effects.

**My inner investor and trader diverge**

In light of this analysis, my inner investor is more cautious than he has been in the past. He has moved back from his aggressive position from an overweight position in equities to a more balanced portfolio between stocks and bonds. He is watching forward EPS estimates carefully as Earnings Seasons progresses to see if there is earnings support for US equities. In addition, he is monitoring the polls in Greece and the UK to see how the political situation develops in Europe over the next few months.

By contrast, my inner trader is seeing numerous technical signs that the brief market hiccup is over. He has covered his shorts and gone long the market, but with tight stops.
