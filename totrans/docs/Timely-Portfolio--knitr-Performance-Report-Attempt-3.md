# Timely Portfolio: knitr Performance Report–Attempt 3

*please see [knitr Performance Report-Attempt 2](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2012/04/knitr-performance-report-attempt-2.html) and [knitr Performance Report-Attempt 1](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2012/04/knitr-performance-report-attempt-1.html)*

Since the time of my last reporting post, RStudio, knitr, and Sweave have worked extremely hard to make document creation easier by becoming even more streamlined and cooperative ([New Version of RStudio (v0.96)](http://blog.rstudio.org/2012/05/14/rstudio-v096/)).  Thanks so much for these extremely helpful and generous contributors.

Over the years, I have developed an outline for client reports that I think applies in most situations in the money management world.  This also fits for performance reporting and marketing, except the transaction history section would either be eliminated or replaced by a section highlighting trades or ideas that have been used in the past.

I thought I would have a completed product before displaying progress, but I just could not wait.  I started working on the Return section.  Please let me know what you think as your comments will guide the rest of the report.  If you are viewing in a RSS reader, you might need to [view through this link](https://www.box.com/s/25e3227a39064a973206), since the embed might not work.
