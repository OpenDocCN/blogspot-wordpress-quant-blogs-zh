## Agile – The ambiguous word

These days everyone is “agile” – well almost 🙂  Like most things, the world isn’t that simple when it comes to agile.  We have coaches getting certified, and believing they are now fully agile, and we have [multiple](https://www.scrum.org/forum/scrum-forum/5533/method-wars-scrum-vs-safe) agile process that an organisation could consider in their agile pursuits:

Deciding which process to follow is going to be difficult.  Everyone has a view, and is an expert.  Whatever process you decide to follow, keep in mind the following:

*   Value – Delivering value in terms of priority
*   Quality – Though story acceptance
*   Metrics – Measure cycle time
