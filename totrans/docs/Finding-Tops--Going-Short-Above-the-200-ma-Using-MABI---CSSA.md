# Finding Tops: Going Short Above the 200 ma Using MABI | CSSA

As previously mentioned, MABI is a great tool for identifying tops.  This is because it when  the MABI oscillator is low (<.5) the market is churning–ie the number of unchanged issues is high, and the gap between advancers and decliners is getting smaller. To give you a simple example, I will define overbought conditions using the z-score of the 100-day SMA–I will use this versus the 200-day because it is more responsive . The z-score is just the bollinger band location relative to the SMA expressed in standard deviation units—ie a z-score of 2.1 means that you are slightly above the upper band, while “0” defines the SMA. In the test, the additional requirement was that the market had to be above the 200ma. I used the HV osc–which is the historical volatility oscillator that measures 10-day historical volatility on a relative basis. When HV is low, this is bearish and often characteristic of tops that tend to have narrow ranges and strong persistence. The results of combining these variables is quite remarkable–shorting above the 200 ma is typically considered a losing proposition. Going short under these circumstances was very profitable—a strong edge:
