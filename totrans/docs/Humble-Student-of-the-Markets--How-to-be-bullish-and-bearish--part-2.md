# Humble Student of the Markets: How to be bullish and bearish, part 2

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2014/06/how-to-be-bullish-and-bearish-part-2.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2014/06/how-to-be-bullish-and-bearish-part-2.html#0001-01-01)

In a past post, I had outlined my long-term concerns for US equities, though I remain relatively constructive on the intermediate term outlook for stock prices (see

[How stocks are both cheap AND expensive](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2014/06/how-stocks-are-both-cheap-and-expensive.html)

).

**Belski long-term bullish**

Now BMO strategist Brian Belski has taken a mirror image of my views, which is long-term cautious but short-term bullish, with a long-term bullish but short-term cautious stance. First, Belski explained his bullishness based on the thesis that we are seeing a secular bull market after a Lost Decade and therefore long-term equity return expectations of 10% are plausible (via

[FT Alphaville](http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2014/06/24/1885112/sp-4236/)

):

> Secular Bull Markets Are Born Out of Lost Decades: Based on historical evidence, stocks typically enter a very long period of expansion after emerging from a period of negative 10-year holding period returns. We found that, on average, these periods last for roughly 15 years and deliver average annual returns of about 16%. Given that 10-year holding period returns emerged from negative territory a little over five years ago and currently stand at 5.5%, it is not unreasonable to assume that there is about 10 years and 10% of average annual returns left to the current bull market should performance follow historical patterns.

**Short-term cautious**

On the other hand, Belski was featured in a recent

[Financial Post](http://business.financialpost.com/2014/06/26/5-signs-canadian-stocks-are-frothy/)

story with the title "5 signs Canadian stocks are frothy", namely:

1.  Forward P/E ratios are near the highest level since 2000
2.  More than 35% of TSX companies are hitting 52-week highs
3.  Volatility is at a record low
4.  Stock performance is significantly outpacing underlying commodities
5.  Recent TSX outperformance has been highly concentrated in energy stocks

Now I recognize that the Canadian stock market is not the same as the US market, but the two economies are tightly bound to each other and the returns of the two markets have shown a high degree of correlation.

While I disagree with Mr. Belski's conclusions (see my previous post 

[How stocks are both cheap AND expensive](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2014/06/how-stocks-are-both-cheap-and-expensive.html)

 for the reasoning), but this is another example of how someone can be both bullish and bearish at the same time. It just depends on your time horizon.
