# Magmasystems Blog: We have 4 Open Positions

> 来源：[http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2006/08/we-have-4-open-positions.html#0001-01-01](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2006/08/we-have-4-open-positions.html#0001-01-01)

Want to work with me at a large Investment Bank in NY and NJ?

Here are 4 positions that we have open right now:

- CI and Agile Champion who ideally can also act as a test architect

- Java master with focus on messaging

- Middle Office architect

- Algo architect, which we may re-position as a generalist Java pro

The Middle Office architect can probably be .NET or Java based.

These positons are all for full-timers.

If you are interested, or know anyone who is, then email me at

magmasystems AT yahoo dot com.
