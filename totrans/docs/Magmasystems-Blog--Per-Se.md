One of the perks of working for Mega-Bank is that you get invited to sales and marketing functions that were previously out of reach to me when I was a consultant. Such was the case this past Wednesday, when I was invited to a marketing function by

[Autonomy](http://www.autonomy.com/)

at

[Per Se](http://www.perseny.com/)

.

If you have never heard of Per Se, then maybe you have heard of The French Laundry, a

Napa

Valley eatery that is run by

reknowned

chef, Thomas Keller. Per Se is Keller's New York City version of the French Laundry, and is one of the most difficult reservations to get in New York.

Autonomy has quarterly executive briefings at Per Se, where they bring together the sales of management of Autonomy, various Autonomy business partners, current customers, and future prospects. In addition to a fantastic lunch, we got to see how Standard and

Poors

used Autonomy to help their analysts get through the millions of pages of regulatory filings. S&P has a team of PHD mathematicians that have have developed some fairly sophisticated models in Autonomy to help them extract the "meat" out of their stream of documents.

Autonomy seems to positioning themselves as a major add-on in the

Sharepoint

marketplace, adding very sophisticated document searching. It would be interested to compare Autonomy with things like Google Search and X1.
