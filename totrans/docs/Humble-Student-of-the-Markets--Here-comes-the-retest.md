# Humble Student of the Markets: Here comes the retest

**Mid-week market update**

: I wrote on the weekend (see

[Where's the fear?](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2021/05/16/wheres-the-fear/)

) that the relief rally that began last Thursday was unconvincing and my base case scenario called for a retest of the lows. The retest appears to be underway. 

Spikes of the VIX Index above its upper Bollinger Band (BB) were signals of an oversold market. Such episodes were resolved in two ways. Strong market rallies were characterized by price momentum and definitive violations of the VIX 20 dma (blue arrows). On the other hand, if the VIX was unable to fall below its 20 dma, the S&P 500 advance stalled and weakened again (grey bars). The current situation appears to fall into the latter category.
