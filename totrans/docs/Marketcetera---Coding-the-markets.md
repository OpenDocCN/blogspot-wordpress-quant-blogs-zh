## Marketcetera

### February 26, 2008

Can [Marketcetera](http://www.marketcetera.com/) be viable competition for Charles River and LatentZero ?  Interesting that their website makes no mention of the “sell market data and trading services” strategy that [Matt Asay details](http://blogs.cnet.com/8301-13505_1-9765946-16.html). They would appear to be following an interesting variation of classic platform strategy a la [Ferguson](http://www.amazon.com/High-Stakes-No-Prisoners-Internet/dp/0812931432). Except in this case they’re not commoditising the layers below. They’re attempting to commoditise the layer above – the OMS – then lock clients into the layer below – the market data and services. It will be interesting to see how they execute on this novel strategy.
