## Writing the Least Amount of Software

Nice to hear [Gojko](http://gojko.net/) in his [Agile](http://www.infoq.com/interviews/interview-gojko-adzic-qcon-2013) Adria [presentation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnK_n9Udhhs), “Make Impacts Not Software”, discuss “off roading” – a term I often use when discussing software projects.  Takeaways from the presentation:

*   Up front decisions prior to software creating can’t be fixed by software
*   Code coverage is not a measure of success
*   Design [Thinking](http://www.metropolismag.com/Point-of-View/July-2013/The-Highs-and-Lows-of-Design-Thinking/) for business
*   Robert [Brinkerhoff](http://www.amazon.com/The-Success-Case-Method-Quickly/dp/1576751856)
*   Data to confirm the engine is working
*   Impact Mapping provides a map of success – connections are assumptions on the map.
*   The Learning Alliance: Systems Thinking in Human Resource [Development](http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Learning-Alliance-Development-Jossey-Bass/dp/1555427111/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0)
*   Effect [Managing](http://www.amazon.com/Effect-Managing-IT-Ingrid-Ottersten/dp/8763001764) IT
*   How to Measure Anything: [Finding](http://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Measure-Anything-Intangibles-Business/dp/0470539399) the Value of Intangibles in Business
