# Magmasystems Blog: Pair Programming

> 来源：[http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2005/10/pair-programming.html#0001-01-01](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2005/10/pair-programming.html#0001-01-01)

There is a

[camp](http://beingextreme.blogspot.com/)

at Finetix that advocates the concept of

[Pair Programming](http://www.pairprogramming.com/)

. I am not convinced, having seen it fail miserably at a former client. However, with a number of people at Finetix having been successful at PP, I am willing to give it another try.

I wonder how much PP has taken hold at CapMarkets companies. Not much, I would think. If you have experience with PP, both positive and negative, I would love to hear it.

All I know is that my programming partner had better use spaces and an indentation level of 2 :-)
