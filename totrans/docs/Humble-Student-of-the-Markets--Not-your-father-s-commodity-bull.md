# Humble Student of the Markets: Not your father's commodity bull

Some chartists have recently become excited over the commodity outlook. Setting aside the headline-driven rise in oil prices, the long-term chart of industrial metals like copper looks bullish. Copper is tracing out a cup-and-handle pattern breakout that targets strong gains in the years ahead. Moreover, the one-and the two-year rate of change, which is designed to look through the effects of the COVID Crash, are elevated but not out of line with past bull phases.

The point and figure chart of copper appears equally impressive. The measured target on a point and figure breakout is an astounding 9.50, which is over a double from current prices.

Is this the start of a new commodity bull? I would argue that this is not your father's commodity bull market.
