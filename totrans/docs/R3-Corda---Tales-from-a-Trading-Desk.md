## R3 Corda

Richard [Brown](http://gendal.me/2016/04/05/introducing-r3-corda-a-distributed-ledger-designed-for-financial-services/) from R3 offers a good overview of the recently announced R3 Corda.  Of note:

> “record, manage and synchronise financial agreements between regulated financial institutions.”
> 
> “Very quickly you realise you need a massively replicated consensus system and, if you don’t want to tie actions to real-world identities, you need something like Proof of Work to make the voting work. You work the logic through and pretty much the whole design (the blockchain, the need for mining, block rewards, maybe even the UTXO transaction model, etc., etc.) drops out.”

> “we are not building a blockchain”
