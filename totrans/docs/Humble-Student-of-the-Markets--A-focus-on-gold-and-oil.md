# Humble Student of the Markets: A focus on gold and oil

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2020/12/a-focus-on-gold-and-oil.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2020/12/a-focus-on-gold-and-oil.html#0001-01-01)

I received considerable feedback from last week's publication (see [How to outperform by 50-250% over 2-3 years](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2020/11/28/how-to-outperform-by-50-250-over-2-3-years/)), mostly related to gold and energy stocks.

In last week's analysis, I had lumped these groups in with other cyclicals. Examining them further, I believe they have bright futures ahead of them.
