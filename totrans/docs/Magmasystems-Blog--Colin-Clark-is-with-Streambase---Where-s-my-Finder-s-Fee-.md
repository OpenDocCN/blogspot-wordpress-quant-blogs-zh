# Magmasystems Blog: Colin Clark is with Streambase - Where's my Finder's Fee?

> 来源：[http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2008/01/colin-clark-is-with-streambase-wheres.html#0001-01-01](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2008/01/colin-clark-is-with-streambase-wheres.html#0001-01-01)

A few week ago, this blog mentioned the news that Colin disbanded Kaskad, and was looking for new opportunities. I also proposed that Streambase hire Colin and some of his gang, as they were all in the Boston area together.

Lo and behold, Colin

[is now with Streambase](http://www.streambase.com/4a2d71c5-d292-4561-9051-eabc73e4203c/press-release-detail.htm)

.

An example of the wonders of the blogging network in action!

Also interesting that Bill Harts is on the Streambase Advisory Board. When I was consulting with Goldman in the late 1980's, I was friendly with Bill, as our groups interacted. I actually interviewed with Bill and Mike Dubnow for a job in Fischer Black's group, but mercifully, they spared me the pain of having to try to understand the world of the Quants (leaving me the opportunity to go full-time into Magma Systems after I left Goldman). Emmanuel Derman has written extensively about the goings-on in Black's little world.

Mike Dubnow eventually became the first Managing Director from the tech side at Goldman, and has since retired. I think that Mike was one of the creators of the SLANG language at Goldman.

On Wall Street, we have an incestuous little circle.
