# Timely Portfolio: More Beautiful Growth of $1 Chart

> 来源：[http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2012/02/more-beautiful-growth-of-1-chart.html#0001-01-01](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2012/02/more-beautiful-growth-of-1-chart.html#0001-01-01)

With all my recent focus on reporting and visualization, you might think that I have the investments all figured out.  Unfortunately, that is not the case, and I will resume more standard investment and systems posts soon.  I did want to share what I think are two more beautiful Growth of a $1 visualizations.  Although my lattice code is far from tight, I think the result is fairly good using and modifying some of the Economist style graphs offered in latticeExtra.

With a little modification, the chart.CumReturns from PerformanceAnalytics can also look very similar.  I will let you choose your favorite.  However, the lattice version will much more likely appear in my reports.
