# VIX and More: A Small Pimple

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/10/small-pimple.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/10/small-pimple.html#0001-01-01)

If you ever desire a better picture of what is really going on in the markets, just zoom out in time a little.  This means that if you spend almost all of your time looking at daily charts and intra-day charts, step back and look at some weekly charts.

Take this week, for instance.  It certainly has been a painful one for longs, particularly those who have been adhering to buy-on-the-pullback strategies.  At some time, however, the bulls need to ask themselves when a pullback may be turning into a full blow bear market.  We aren’t there yet – in fact it's not even close – and a glimpse at the weekly chart makes this week’s action look like little more than a pimple on a bull’s butt.  More importantly, it’s just one week and a lone week of action is rarely decisive enough to mark a turning point with any degree of confidence – even if it generates [three Hindenburg Omen signals](http://www.highgrowthstock.com/IanBlog/?p=201#comments).

Things will get interesting if and when some of the recent market leaders start to roll over in their short-term moving averages.  With the exception of perhaps [Mastercard (MA)](http://stockcharts.com/charts/gallery.html?ma), I haven’t seen this happen yet, but I have my eyes on a few of the China stocks just in case, most notably:  [China Mobile (CHL)](http://stockcharts.com/charts/gallery.html?chl); [China Southern Airlines (ZNH)](http://stockcharts.com/charts/gallery.html?znh); [China Life Insurance (LFC)](http://stockcharts.com/charts/gallery.html?lfc); and, of course, [Baidu (BIDU)](http://stockcharts.com/charts/gallery.html?bidu).
