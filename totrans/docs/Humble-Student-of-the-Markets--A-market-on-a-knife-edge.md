**Mid-week market update**

: Regular readers know that I have been tactically cautious on stocks in the last two weeks, but I don't want to give the impression that I am wildly bearish. In fact, the SPX is on the verge of a long-term buy signal, marked by the positive monthly MACD reading. Should the index close at or close to current levels by month-end, it will have flashed a buy signal that has shown to be highly effective for intermediate and long term investors.

Before anyone becomes wildly bullish here, some caution may be warranted.
