# VIX and More: Opinions Wanted: Predict the VIX on 12/31/2010

Let's see how well the wisdom of the crowds works.

Instead of a simple poll, I am curious not just where readers think the VIX will be at the end 2010, but also what some of the more important forces acting on volatility will be in the coming year.

So go ahead and make those comments sing...
