The Livermore “Active Issues” Index is a new universal index methodology that can be applied to find the best liquid momentum stocks in any index. It is “bias-free” and is ideal for trend trading in all time frames. No fundamental data has been incorporated, only price and volume data and statistics. It can also be used as a passive way to create alpha by hedging using its underlying index ETF for high risk adjusted returns that are uncorrelated to the RSI2 or DV2 and other short-term strategies.  Welcome to the new and improved IBD100!   *performance data to be presented today  [https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2009/11/25/performance-of-the-livermore-active-issues-index-created-from-the-nasdaq-100/](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2009/11/25/performance-of-the-livermore-active-issues-index-created-from-the-nasdaq-100/)*
