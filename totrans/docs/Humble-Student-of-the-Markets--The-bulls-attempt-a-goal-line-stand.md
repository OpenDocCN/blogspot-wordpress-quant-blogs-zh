**Mid-week market update**

: As the S&P 500 tests the lows for 2022, the question for investors and traders is whether support will hold. The analysis of the large-cap S&P 500, the mid-cap S&P 400, and the small-cap Russell 2000 presents a mixed picture. While large and mid-caps appear to be holding support, small-caps look wobbly.

A violation of support would open up considerable downside potential and this is the equivalent of the bulls' goal-line stand. Will they be successful?
