# Vista Build 5384, Office Beta 2 | Tales from a Trading Desk

## Vista Build 5384, Office Beta 2

To be honest I wish I’d never installed [Vista beta 2](http://msdn.microsoft.com/windowsvista/downloads/products/getthebeta/). Vista failed to identify the ethernet card on my portable and Dell desktop. I’d actually go so far as to say the driver support at this stage in the Vista development cycle is rubbish. I’ve been a beta tester on a number of previous Window OS’s, and I can’t recall getting to beta 2 and finding the machines I’ve installed the OS on being unable to access the network/internet.

Office beta 2 – the ribbons are very cool. However, I’m unimpressed that VBA still exists in Excel as the language of choice for code. With the release of CLR 2.0, I would have expected by now that Excel would have native .NET support. So much for making life easier for quants/traders to move towards C#.
