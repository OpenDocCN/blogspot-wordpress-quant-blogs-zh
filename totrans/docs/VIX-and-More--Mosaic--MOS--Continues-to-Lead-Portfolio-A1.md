# VIX and More: Mosaic (MOS) Continues to Lead Portfolio A1

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/10/mosaic-mos-continues-to-lead-portfolio.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/10/mosaic-mos-continues-to-lead-portfolio.html#0001-01-01)

The title is probably a considerable understatement, but what else can you say about a stock that is up 91% in only ten weeks in the portfolio?

The amazing run of [The Mosaic Company (MOS)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=mos&hl=en) has helped to push Portfolio A1’s performance to a cumulative return of 14.15% since the portfolio inception on February 16, 2007.  This is 8.67% better than the 5.48% returned by the benchmark S&P 500 index during the period.

Mosaic’s performance has triggered a number of thoughts about portfolio design, backtesting, and the likelihood of catching lightning in a bottle.  Simply stated, in the 8 ½ months that Portfolio A1 has been up and running, it has purchased 27 stocks.  Almost half of these stocks are up 50% during this period and 30% ([MOS](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=mos), [DRYS](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=drys), [BRP](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=brp), [PCU](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=pcu), [PBR](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=pbr), [RIO](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=rio), [CNH](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=cnh), and [SNDA](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=snda)) are up an astonishing 100% or more.  The bottom line is that I believe it is possible identify stocks that have a high likelihood of doubling or tripling in one year (with attendant risk, of course) and build portfolio rules to maximize the probability of capturing those gains during the time they are held in one’s portfolio.  I will expand upon this going forward, but Portfolio A1 should provide some evidence to support that contention.

There is one change to the portfolio: [Navistar International (NAVZ)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=navz) has been dropped and is being replaced by returnee [PepsiAmerican (PAS)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=pas), the beverage bottler.  There are no other changes to the portfolio this week.

A snapshot of the portfolio is as follows:
