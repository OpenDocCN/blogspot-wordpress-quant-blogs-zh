JP Morgan’s [Thought](http://www.jpmorgan.com/tss/General/Thought_Magazine/1320503914634) magazine provides an interesting [read](http://blogs.sungard.com/tag/collateral-management/) on [collateral](http://www.jpmorgan.com/tss/General/Thinking_Out_Loud/1320503737324) management:

> Key themes in this issue include mandatory clearing, the evolving role of central counterparties, impacts on liquidity and tri-party repo structures.
