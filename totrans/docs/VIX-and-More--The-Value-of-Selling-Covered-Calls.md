# VIX and More: The Value of Selling Covered Calls

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/09/value-of-selling-covered-calls.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/09/value-of-selling-covered-calls.html#0001-01-01)

One subject that gets less attention than it deserves is the value investors can extract from selling [covered calls](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/covered%20calls).  To be fair, a covered call strategy sacrifices what can sometimes be considerable upside in exchange for a fixed return, but this can be a highly effective strategy in a range-bound market.

The chart below is a weekly chart that shows the CBOE S&P 500 Buy-Write Index ([BXM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/BXM)), which is designed to replicate a [buy-write](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/buy-write) or covered call strategy for the S&P 500 Index.  Note that during the recent bull market, a buy-write strategy resulted in roughly the same returns as owing the SPX, but with less volatility.

More importantly, over the course of the last year, a buy-write strategy has significantly outperformed the SPX.  The details can be seen in the next chart, where a relatively new ETF, the PowerShares S&P 500 BuyWrite Portfolio ([PBP](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/PBP)) has lost value at less than half of the rate of the losses in the SPX.

In sideways markets, in down markets, and even in up markets, a buy-write or covered call approach like that of the PBP (or first cousins [BEP](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/BEP) and [MCN](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/MCN)) can be an excellent way to increase returns and reduce risk.
