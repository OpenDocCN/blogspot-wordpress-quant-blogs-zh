## PDC 2009 Is¬†Near

The [PDC 2009](http://microsoftpdc.com/) is just over a week away. Looking at the [sessions](http://microsoftpdc.com/Sessions), if I were going (which I‚Äôm not üò¶ ) I‚Äôd take a keen interesting in the following:

*   Concurrency Fuzzing & Data [Races](http://microsoftpdc.com/Sessions/VTL32)
*   Building Amazing Business Applications with Microsoft Silverlight and Microsoft .NET RIA [Services](http://microsoftpdc.com/Sessions/CL21)
*   Advanced [Topics](http://microsoftpdc.com/Sessions/CL22) for Building Large-Scale Applications with Microsoft Silverlight
*   [Rx](http://microsoftpdc.com/Sessions/VTL04): Reactive Extensions for .NET
*   [Infer.NET](http://microsoftpdc.com/Sessions/VTL03): Building Software with Intelligence ‚Äì download and samples available [here](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/cambridge/projects/infernet/) if you want to read up prior to the PDC
*   Data-Intensive Computing on Windows HPC Server with the DryadLINQ [Framework](http://microsoftpdc.com/Sessions/SVR17) ‚Äì DryadLINQ is a cool technology I [blogged](http://www.ddj.com/windows/207401588) about a sometime ago. I‚Äôm still unclear why Microsoft hasn‚Äôt moving [DryadLINQ](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/dryadlinq/) into the HPC land as a full product given its work with PLINQ. Maybe the PDC will make things clearer? (
*   Building [Hybrid](http://microsoftpdc.com/Sessions/SVC18) Cloud Applications with Windows Azure and the Service Bus
*   Microsoft Project Code Name ‚ÄúM‚Äù: The Data and Modeling [Language](http://microsoftpdc.com/Sessions/FT34)
*   Future of Garbage [Collection](http://microsoftpdc.com/Sessions/FT51)
*   Scaling Your Data Tier with Microsoft [Project](http://microsoftpdc.com/Sessions/FT26) Code Name ‚ÄúVelocity‚Äù ‚Äì Velocity is aimed directly at [Coherence](http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/coherence/index.html) (Oracle), but maybe Microsoft want to look Gigaspaces, and features such as [Process Units](http://www.gigaspaces.com/wiki/display/XAP7/Step+One+-+Using+Processing+Units+for+Scaling).
*   Windows 7 Developer Boot [Camp](http://microsoftpdc.com/Sessions/WKSP08)
*   Mastering Microsoft .NET RIA [Services](http://microsoftpdc.com/Sessions/CL07)
*   Advanced Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 [StreamInsight](http://microsoftpdc.com/Sessions/SVR08) ‚Äì having been on a number of conference calls with Roman and Torsten, it would have been nice to finally meet them
