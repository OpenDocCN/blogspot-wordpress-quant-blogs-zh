Now that

[China has overtaken Japan as the second largest economy](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/16/business/global/16yuan.html)

, I post the following poem, which was published in the

[Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/16/AR2008051603460.html)

 in 2008, without comment:

> When we were the Sick Man of Asia,
> We were called the Yellow Peril.
> When we are billed as the next Superpower, we are called The Threat.
> When we closed our doors, you launched the Opium War to open our markets.
> When we embraced free trade, you blamed us for stealing your jobs.
> When we were falling apart, you marched in your troops and demanded your fair share.
> When we tried to put the broken pieces back together again, Free Tibet, you screamed. It was an Invasion!
> When we tried communism, you hated us for being communist.
> When we embraced capitalism, you hated us for being capitalist.
> When we had a billion people, you said we were destroying the planet.
> When we tried limiting our numbers, you said we abused human rights.
> When we were poor, you thought we were dogs.
> When we lend you cash, you blame us for your national debts.
> When we build our industries, you call us polluters.
> When we sell you goods, you blame us for global warming.
> When we buy oil, you call it exploitation and genocide.
> When you go to war for oil, you call it liberation.
> When we were lost in chaos, you demanded the rule of law.
> When we uphold law and order against violence, you call it a violation of human rights.
> When we were silent, you said you wanted us to have free speech.
> When we are silent no more, you say we are brainwashed xenophobes.
> Why do you hate us so much? we asked.
> No, you answered, we don't hate you.
> We don't hate you either,
> But do you understand us?
> Of course we do, you said,
> We have AFP, CNN and BBC. . . .
> What do you really want from us?
> Think hard first, then answer . . .
> Because you only get so many chances.
> Enough is Enough, Enough Hypocrisy for This One World.
> We want One World, One Dream, and Peace on Earth.
> This Big Blue Earth is Big Enough for all of Us.
