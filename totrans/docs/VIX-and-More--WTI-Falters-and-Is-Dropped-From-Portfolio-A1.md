After racking up gains of 26.4% in just three weeks in the portfolio, it only took one week for [W&T Offshore (WTI)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=wti) to falter and be dropped from the portfolio.  The culprit, as it often is, was earnings.  More accurately, it was [an analyst downgrade](http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/080229/w_t_offshore_mover.html?.v=2) following WTI’s earnings report that helped to push the stock down 8.7% on Friday and trigger a sale.  Interestingly, WTI’s stock traded up following [Thursday morning’s earnings report](http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/080228/earns_w_t_offshore.html?.v=1) and a generally successful [conference call](http://seekingalpha.com/article/66556-w-amp-t-offshore-q4-2007-earnings-call-transcript?source=yahoo&page=-1) with analysts later that morning. It wasn't until Friday that the analyst's comments took their toll.

Friday’s slump in WTI and the rest of the portfolio undid what had been a very successful week to that point, with the result that Portfolio A1 end up losing 0.86% to the benchmark S&P 500 index for the week.  Over the 1 year and 2 weeks since Portfolio A1’s inception, the cumulative return stands at 9.9% vs. -8.6% for the SPX.

In addition to WTI, [Fresh Del Monte Produce (FDP)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=fdp) also bows out after several lackluster weeks. Replacing these two holdings are returnee [StatoilHydro (STO)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=sto), the state-owned Norwegian oil giant, and a new addition, <place st="on"><city st="on">San Juan</city></place>, Puerto Rico-based [Oriental Financial Group (OFG)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=ofg), a $500 million (market cap) bank whose stock is up almost 150% since August 2007.

There no additional changes to the portfolio this week.

A snapshot of Portfolio A1 is as follows:
