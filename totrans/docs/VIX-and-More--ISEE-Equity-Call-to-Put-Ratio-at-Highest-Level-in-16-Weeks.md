# VIX and More: ISEE Equity Call to Put Ratio at Highest Level in 16 Weeks

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/12/isee-equity-call-to-put-ratio-at.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/12/isee-equity-call-to-put-ratio-at.html#0001-01-01)

The [ISEE](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/ISEE) equity [call to put ratio](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/put%20to%20call) hit a 16 week high of 189 on Friday, as investors showed a strong preference for calls over puts. Today that ratio is even higher, at 215 as of 11:30 a.m. ET.

Trading is light so far and extreme values in the ISEE have a tendency to revert to the mean (146) as the day wears on, but coming on the heels of Friday’s high number, I believe the ISEE numbers should bear watching throughout the day.

For the record, the last time the ISEE equity call to put ratio was over 200 in a single session was back in the middle of May. At that time, the markets were just in the process of putting in a post-March top.
