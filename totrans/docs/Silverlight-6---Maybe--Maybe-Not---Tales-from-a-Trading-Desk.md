# Silverlight 6 – Maybe, Maybe Not | Tales from a Trading Desk

## Silverlight 6 – Maybe, Maybe Not

I hear similar things to what Mary [reports](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/will-there-be-a-silverlight-6-and-does-it-matter/11180):

> Several of my customer and partner contacts have told me they have heard from their own Microsoft sources over the past couple of weeks that Silverlight 5 is the last version of Silverlight that Microsoft will release.

But then again, we know on the subject of Silverlight, Microsoft has been quite bad on messaging 😦
