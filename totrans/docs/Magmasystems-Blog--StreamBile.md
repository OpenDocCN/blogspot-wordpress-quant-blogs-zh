We love bile here! Here is a little bile from Mark Palmer on Apama:

while giving some kudos to Kaskad. According to

[this](http://www.progress.com/realtime/company/management/index.ssp)

page, Mark Palmer is the VP of Complex Event Processing at Progress Software, a competitor to Streambase.

Judging by some recent comments on Matt's blog, it seems like the CEP vendors relish in sniping at eachother. More bile! We love it!

Meanwhile, we hear from Terry that Gemstone has been impressive with their recent release of a native .NET client. Coming right on the heels of similar announcements from Gigaspaces and Tangasol.
