# Humble Student of the Markets: Is the World Bank downgrade of China's growth the nadir?

[Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/08/us-worldbank-asia-outlook-idUSBRE89701420121008)

reported that the World Bank downgraded China's growth outlook to 7.7% this year from 8.2% and 8.1% in 2013 from 8.6%. It also highlighted the downside risks to the forecast.

> The World Bank earlier on Monday released its latest East Asia and Pacific Data Monitor, warning China's that slowdown could accelerate.
> 
> In the report, the international lender said that ambitious investment plans announced by several local governments in China could face funding constraints, "not least because governments are feeling the pinch of a cooling real estate market, which lowers land sales revenues".
> 
> The World Bank said the central government was unlikely to come up with a major fiscal stimulus package as policymakers were concerned about a rebound in home prices and a possible reversal of hot money flows.

I wrote last week that there were early signs of a turnaround in China's growth outlook (see

[China dodges a bullet?](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2012/10/china-dodges-bullet.html)

). Now

[Macro Man](http://macro-man.blogspot.com/2012/10/asian-exports-turning.html)

wrote about signs of a bounce in Asian exports, including China.

> So, adding it all up, TMM [Team Macro Man] reckon with China back this week, the potential is there for the market to reassess the Asia slowdown trades, because it looks to us as though these are - particularly in China and Australia - past their sell-by date.

While I do take their analysis with a grain of salt because

[Macro Man is long the AUD](http://macro-man.blogspot.com/2012/10/taking-plunge.html)

and therefore talking their book, these disparate indicators nevertheless form a mosaic picture of a nascent growth turnaround in Asia and China in particular.

In this case, the World Bank downgrade of China's growth outlook may be the nadir of Asian slowdown fears.
