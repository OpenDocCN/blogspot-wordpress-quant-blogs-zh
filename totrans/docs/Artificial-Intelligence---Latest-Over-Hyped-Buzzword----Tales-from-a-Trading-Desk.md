# Artificial Intelligence – Latest Over Hyped Buzzword? | Tales from a Trading Desk

## Artificial Intelligence – Latest Over Hyped Buzzword?

I read in [CityAM](http://www.cityam.com/241194/accentures-launching-an-artificial-intelligence-practice-with-ipsofts-amelia) this morning that Accenture is starting an Artifical Intelligence practice.  I wonder if that now means that Artificial Intelligence is similar to Big Data – a buzzword that is over hyped, and shouldn’t be used anymore due to the baggage associated with it?  It appears focused on virtual [agents](https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/accenture-and-ipsoft-launch-accenture-amelia-practice-to-help-organizations-accelerate-adoption-of-artificial-intelligence.htm), which maybe good or bad 🙂

> to develop go-to-market strategies, solutions and consulting service offerings around deployments of virtual agent technology for clients across several industries with initial focus on banking, insurance and travel.
