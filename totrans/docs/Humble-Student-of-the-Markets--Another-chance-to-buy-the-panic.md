# Humble Student of the Markets: Another chance to buy the panic

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2021/07/another-chance-to-buy-panic.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2021/07/another-chance-to-buy-panic.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models** 

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post, 

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The 

**Trend Asset Allocation Model**

 is an asset allocation model that applies trend following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. The performance and full details of a model portfolio based on the out-of-sample signals of the Trend Model can be found

[here](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/trend-model-report-card/)

.

My inner trader uses a 

**trading model**

, which is a blend of price momentum (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa). Subscribers receive real-time alerts of model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of the email alerts is updated weekly 

[here](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/trading-track-record/)

. The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that began in March 2016 is shown below.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Buy equities*
*   Trend Model signal: Bullish*
*   Trading model: Bullish*

: I generally update model readings on my

 on weekends and tweet mid-week observations at @humblestudent. Subscribers receive real-time alerts of trading model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of those email alerts is shown

**A magazine cover buy signal?**

Investors and traders who stepped up and bought into the market panic last Monday profited handsomely when stock prices staged a relief rally. Another panic opportunity may be presenting itself, this time in the energy sector.

Historically, The Economist magazine covers have been excellent contrarian market signals (see

[What a bond market rally could mean for your investments](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2021/05/29/what-a-bond-market-rally-could-mean-for-your-investments/)

). The Economist may have done it again this week with a focus on the global warming effects of heat waves in North American and floods in Germany.

Notwithstanding the public policy issues, which are beyond my pay grade, here is what it could mean for selected energy equities.
