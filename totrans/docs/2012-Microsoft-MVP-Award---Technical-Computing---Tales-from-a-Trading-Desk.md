## 2012 Microsoft MVP Award – Technical Computing

I was somewhat surprised to see a “Congratulations 2012 Microsoft MVP!”  email this morning.

> This award is given to exceptional technical community leaders who actively share their high quality, real world expertise with others. We appreciate your outstanding contributions in Technical Computing technical communities during the past year
> 
> The Microsoft MVP Award provides us the unique opportunity to celebrate and honor your significant contributions and say “Thank you for your technical leadership.”.
