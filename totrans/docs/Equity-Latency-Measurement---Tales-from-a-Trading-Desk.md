# Equity Latency Measurement | Tales from a Trading Desk

## Equity Latency Measurement

Due to the mass of email/code/stuff one get each day, sometimes it takes me a while to get round to reading everything.  Hence somewhat delayed, but still worth mentioning is a now slightly old article by [Low-Latency.com](http://low-latency.com/), Measuring Latency in Equity [Transactions](http://low-latency.com/article/measuring-latency-equity-transactions).  The article provide figures for  State-of-the-Art Latency general usage connections, coupled with a good overview of latency in financial markets from a viewpoint of exchanges.  Page 6 gives some  key latency numbers for asset classes.  Figure 4 should be familiar to anyone who’s working in the venue connectivity space.  Table 3 is relevant to anyone working or considering working in the global trading connectivity space.

Overall, excellent article, and worth the reading time.
