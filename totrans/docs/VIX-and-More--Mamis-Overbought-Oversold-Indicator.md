# VIX and More: Mamis Overbought-Oversold Indicator

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/02/mamis-overbought-oversold-indicator.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/02/mamis-overbought-oversold-indicator.html#0001-01-01)

One of the books I have recommended frequently to beginning investors is [When to Sell](http://www.amazon.com/When-Sell-Strategies-Stock-Market-Profits/dp/0870341340/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/105-1842513-2805206?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1182183976&sr=1-1), which was written by Justin Mamis in 1977\. Among the books many gems Mamis unveils is the Overbought-Oversold Indicator, which is a simple 10 day moving average of the NYSE advances minus declines. Helene Meisler, a Mamis protégé, [later popularized](http://www.thestreet.com/story/722372/helene-meislers-technical-indicators-a-primer.html) the Overbought-Oversold Indicator and blogger Ron Sen at [Technically Speaking](http://ronsen.blogspot.com/) has championed the same indicator over the past few years, usually adding in a 30 day moving average for comparison purposes and calling it the Mamis-Meisler Breadth Oscillator.

In non-trending markets, a good market [breadth](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/breadth) oscillator can be a trader’s best friend and with the SPX for now at least apparently stuck in a trading range between 1070 and 1150, breadth becomes an important piece of the overall technical puzzle.

The chart below captures what I will call the Mamis Overbought-Oversold Indicator (MOOI?) and shows negative extremes in the 10 day moving average (solid blue line) of at least -400 to be solid predictors of oversold conditions. The positive extremes (dotted red line) of +700 or so are less valuable in terms of calling market tops, but often presage a selloff. Right now, the indicator suggests a bullish oversold market.

Of course there are no perfect technical indicators, but in choppy markets a reliable market breadth oscillator can be a powerful timing tool.
