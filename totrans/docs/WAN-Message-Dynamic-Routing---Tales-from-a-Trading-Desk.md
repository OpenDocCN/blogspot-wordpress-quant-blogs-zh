## WAN Message Dynamic Routing

Interesting [Informatica](http://www.informatica.com/uk/products/messaging/options/ultra-messaging-dynamic-routing/) Ultra Messaging WAN [feature](http://www.informatica.com/Images/02229_ultra-messaging-dynamic-routing-option_ds_en-US.pdf). With an FX [spin](http://vip.informatica.com/?elqPURLPage=10756):

> Foreign Exchange (FX) trading applications need guaranteed messaging over the WAN to send dealable streaming prices across geographic and network boundaries, since the center of FX liquidity follows the Sun. But many FX trading applications encounter challenges with reliability and limited bandwidth due to the limitations of WAN connections. As a result, costs go up, revenues go down, and it becomes harder for companies to compete.

Curious is any readers have latency numbers for this feature with pricing engines.
