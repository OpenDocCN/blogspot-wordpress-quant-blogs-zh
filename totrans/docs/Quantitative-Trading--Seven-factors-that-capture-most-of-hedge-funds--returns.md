The Economist magazine just published an

[article](http://economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8892422)

that talked about "synthetic" hedge funds, or replicating hedge fund returns using factor models. The original research cited can be found

[here](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=778124)

. (For those of you who want a primer on factor models, I have written an

[article](http://epchan.blogspot.com/2006/12/do-factor-models-work-in-short-term.html)

on this topic previously.) The seven factors are (are you ready?):

1) excess return on the S&P 500 index;

2) a small minus big factor constructed as the difference of the Wilshire small and large

capitalization stock indices;

3) excess returns on portfolios of lookback straddle options on currencies;

4) excess returns on portfolios of lookback straddle options on commodities;

5) excess returns on portfolios of lookback straddle options on bonds;

6) the yield spread of the US ten year treasury bond over the three month T-bill, adjusted for the duration of the ten year bond;

7) the change in the credit spread of the Moody's BAA bond over the 10 year treasury bond, also appropriately adjusted for duration.

According to the researchers, factors 3)-5) are constructed to replicate the maximum possible return to trend-following strategies on their respective underlying assets.

See, it is not that difficult to run a hedge fund after all!
