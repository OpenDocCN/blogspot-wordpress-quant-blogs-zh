[that strong SOX action can often be a good harbinger](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2008/08/sox-bucks-selloff-again.html)

for the the market. While both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq failed to gain even 1% on Friday, the SOX rose more than 4%. It’s especially unusual for the SOX to post such strong gains without bringing the Nasdaq composite along with it. It has provided a nicely bullish expectation for the Nasdaq going forward.
