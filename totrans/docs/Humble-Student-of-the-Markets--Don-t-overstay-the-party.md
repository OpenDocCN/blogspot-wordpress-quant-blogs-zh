# Humble Student of the Markets: Don't overstay the party

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2022/01/dont-overstay-party.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2022/01/dont-overstay-party.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models** 

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post, 

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The 

**Trend Asset Allocation Model**

 is an asset allocation model that applies trend following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. The performance and full details of a model portfolio based on the out-of-sample signals of the Trend Model can be found

[here](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/trend-model-report-card/)

.

My inner trader uses a 

**trading model**

, which is a blend of price momentum (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa). Subscribers receive real-time alerts of model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of the email alerts is updated weekly 

[here](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/trading-track-record/)

. The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that began in March 2016 is shown below.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Buy equities*
*   Trend Model signal: Bullish*
*   Trading model: Bullish*

: I generally update model readings on my

 on weekends and tweet mid-week observations at @humblestudent. Subscribers receive real-time alerts of trading model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of those email alerts is shown

**Edge towards the exit**

Happy New Year! I hope you are enjoying the seasonal rally, but don't get overly complacent about the party that the bulls are throwing. Sufficient warning signs are appearing that it's time to edge towards the exit.

Exhibit A is the relative performance of the top five sectors of the S&P 500\. These sectors comprise over three-quarters of index weight and it would be impossible for the S&P 500 to rise or fall without the leadership of a majority of sectors. As the accompanying chart shows, none of the sectors are in a relative uptrend. The most bullish pattern is technology, which is trading sideways compared to the S&P 500.

Once the seasonal strength fades, what happens to the market?
