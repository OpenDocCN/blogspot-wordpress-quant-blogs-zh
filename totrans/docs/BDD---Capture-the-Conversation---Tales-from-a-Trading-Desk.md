## BDD – Capture the Conversation

Gojko provides an interesting [talk](http://vimeo.com/43612884) from NDC 2012.  Takeaways from the talk:

*   Tools do not solve problems
*   Scrum is not a tool!
*   Software engineers are obsessed with [tools](http://chrismdp.com/2012/09/cucumber-isnt-a-testing-tool/)
*   Process problems are not solved by tools

Chris provide a good view with regards to the [various](http://chrismdp.com/2011/09/layers-of-abstraction-bdd-ux/) behaviours:

*   Business – led by product owner
*   Workflow – led by UX
*   Specific activity – led by developer/designers

What’s the downside?
