# Humble Student of the Markets: Oversold enough for a bottom?

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2024/04/oversold-enough-for-bottom.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2024/04/oversold-enough-for-bottom.html#0001-01-01)

**Mid-week market update:**

I wrote on the weekend that conditions were setting up for a panic bottom (see

[Here comes the sentiment flush](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2024/04/14/here-comes-the-sentiment-flush/)

), but one final flush may be necessary to spark a relief rally. The S&P 500 has now achieved the milestones for a panic bottom. The stochastic is sufficiently oversold. The index violated its 50 dma and it's now filling the February 22nd gap after the strong NVIDIA earnings report, which represents a secondary support level.

The key questions are:

*   Is this a bottom?
*   If this is a bottom, is it a durable bottom or just a bounce before prices weaken further?
