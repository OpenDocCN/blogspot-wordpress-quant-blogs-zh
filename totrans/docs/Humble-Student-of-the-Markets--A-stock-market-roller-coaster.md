# Humble Student of the Markets: A stock market roller coaster

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2020/03/a-stock-market-roller-coaster.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2020/03/a-stock-market-roller-coaster.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models**

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post,

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The

**Trend Asset Allocation Model**

is an asset allocation model which applies trend following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or contraction (bearish)?"

My inner trader uses a

**trading model**

, which is a blend of price momentum (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa). Subscribers receive real-time alerts of model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of the those email alerts are updated weekly

. The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that began in March 2016 is shown below.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Buy equities*
*   Trend Model signal: Bearish*
*   Trading model: Bullish*

.

**Here we go again?**

For two consecutive Fridays, the market has rallied into the close to exhibit hammer-like reversal candles. The first candle reversal was confirmed by a massive 4.3% surge on the following Monday, will the same happen this coming Monday?

While I am cautiously bullish at a tactical level, it could also be argued that the market has not sufficiently tested the February lows. Should stock prices retreat to test those lows early next week, the bulls can take some comfort that any test would likely be accompanied by positive 5 and 14 day RSI divergences. On the other hand, the bears are likely to defend the highs set in the rally last week, which could make trading the market an interesting challenge.

Investors and traders should brace for more thrills from the market roller coast.
