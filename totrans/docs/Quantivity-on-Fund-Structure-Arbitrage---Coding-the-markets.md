## Quantivity on Fund Structure Arbitrage

### August 29, 2011

[Fascinating post](http://quantivity.wordpress.com/2011/08/28/fund-structure-arbitrage/) from Quantivity – I’m hoping for more on the same topic from him. Many of the advantages listed would be enjoyed by any small non real money fund: hedge, prop, family office etc. Of course there are some serious obstacles that small (relatively) unregulated funds face, and Lars Kroijer describes them in detail in [Money Mavericks](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Money-Mavericks-Confessions-Manager-Financial/dp/027373198X). And a lack of legacy technology is indeed an advantage in building trading systems quickly. A relatively recent pre existing framework, either from vendor or in house built can be a big advantage though. A classic example is gateways for exchange/ECN connectivity.
