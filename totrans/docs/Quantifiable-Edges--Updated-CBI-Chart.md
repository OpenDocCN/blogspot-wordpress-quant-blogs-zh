# Quantifiable Edges: Updated CBI Chart

> 来源：[http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2008/03/updated-cbi-chart.html#0001-01-01](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2008/03/updated-cbi-chart.html#0001-01-01)

The

[Capitulative Breadth Indicator (CBI)](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/search/label/CBI)

returned to “zero” yesterday, finally closing out the last of the recent trade cluster. Below is an updated chart of the index.

I’ve discussed this crude market timing system

[in the past](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2008/01/my-capitulative-breadth-indicator.html)

. Since 1995 it would now have proved profitable in 18 out of 18 trades – most of which occurred during “scary” selloffs.
