I should thank my lucky starts. i turned bearish last Wednesday (see

[Why this time is (sort of) different](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2020/02/19/why-this-time-is-sort-of-different/)

) and tactically shorted the market just as equities topped out, followed by today's -3% downdraft.

As today proceeded, I fielded several inquiries from readers with versions of the same question, "Nice call last week. Is it time to buy, or are you covering your short?"
