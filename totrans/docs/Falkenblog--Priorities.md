From

:

> A TV reporter in Denmark wanted to prove the danger of shampoo. She said some hair-care products contain toxic chemicals. So she poured them into a fish tank. A dozen guppies proved her point by dying in front of the TV cameras. A veterinarian turned her in for animal cruelty. The reporter has been convicted in the incident from 2004\. But the trial took so long, the judge decided not to punish her.

Awkward. I'm probably on Most Wanted posters in Denmark, given my experience with aquariums, and fishing (aka, fish torture).
