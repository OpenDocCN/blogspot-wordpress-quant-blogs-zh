Last week, in [VIX and More Stock of the Week Selection Up 343% in 14 Months](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/05/stock-of-week-selection-up-373-in-14.html), I promised to post on the blog the current [Stock of the Week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/stock%20of%20the%20week) selection as long as the winning streak (now at 12 weeks and counting) continues.

First, to get caught up with last week’s business, Core-Mark Holding Company ([CORE](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/CORE)), finished last week up 14.4%. This week’s selection, Tech Data ([TECD](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TECD)) posted a 1.4% gain yesterday, bringing the cumulative 14 month return of the Stock of the Week ‘Sequential Portfolio’ to +362.87%.
