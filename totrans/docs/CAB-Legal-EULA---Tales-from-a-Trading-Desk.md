## CAB Legal EULA

Banks/hedge funds often get worried about Microsoft’s [EULA](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnpag2/html/pageula.asp) that goes with [CAB](http://practices.gotdotnet.com/projects/cab), Enterprise Library etc – I’ve seen this happen in four companies over the past year. A recent internal Lab49 posting detailed an approach to licences:

*   Review your application for all open source components, and make sure that they are either distinctly separate applications, or that their licenses do not include the [Copyleft](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html) requirement
*   Understand the [rules](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html) of [engagement](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#IfInterpreterIsGPL)
