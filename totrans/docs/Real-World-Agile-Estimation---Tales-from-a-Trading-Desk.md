## Real World Agile Estimation

ThoughtWorks has an interesting [deck](http://www.thoughtworks-studios.com/sites/default/files/resource/twebook-perspectives-estimation_1.pdf) on “How do you estimate on an Agile project?” which provide a number of real-world stories.  A few thoughts:

*   Slide 12 – Basically delete the word “estimate” from your vocabulary and replace with “size”.  I concur on the time/cost thought process.
*   Slide 15 – “Capture all assumptions” – often a fail when estimation occurs 😦
*   Slide 18 – “When planning the release I do it at epic/feature level linked to a business outcome” – the sensible given the marry back to business ROI
*   Slide 18 – “value of an estimation session is to align the team around scope, solution, risk and complexity” – all to often estimation session are run badly with the wrong outcome
