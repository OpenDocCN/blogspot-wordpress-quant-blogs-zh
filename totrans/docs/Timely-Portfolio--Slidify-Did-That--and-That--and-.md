# Timely Portfolio: Slidify Did That… and That… and…

> 来源：[http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2013/07/slidify-did-that-and-that-and.html#0001-01-01](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2013/07/slidify-did-that-and-that-and.html#0001-01-01)

In my exuberance for [rCharts](http://rcharts.io/site), I have not expressed my equal love for its older sibling [slidify](http://slidify.org).  I adopted slidify a little more slowly than other R bloggers

because I failed to realize that slidify does way more than just slideshows.  It acts as an almost universal presentation layer for R.   I am guessing that you have already seen some presentations created by slidify.  To make sure that slidify gets the credit in my work, I wanted to provide a list of examples that slidify created straight from R.  In these slidify gives me the power of [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [Minimal](https://github.com/orderedlist/minimal), and [Bootplus](http://aozora.github.io/bootplus/).

All of these are github repos, so you can see the source and reproduce.

Slidify is easy and intuitive, and it makes HTML/CSS/javascript all accessible to the average R user.  It has become part of my workflow, and I now start with .Rmd more than than I start with .R.
