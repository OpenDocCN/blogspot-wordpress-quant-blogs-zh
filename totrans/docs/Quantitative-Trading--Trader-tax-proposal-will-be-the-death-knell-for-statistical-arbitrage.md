# Quantitative Trading: Trader tax proposal will be the death knell for statistical arbitrage

> 来源：[http://epchan.blogspot.com/2009/02/trader-tax-proposal-will-be-death-knell.html#0001-01-01](http://epchan.blogspot.com/2009/02/trader-tax-proposal-will-be-death-knell.html#0001-01-01)

U.S. Congressman Peter DeFazio, introduced H.R. 1068: “Let Wall Street Pay for Wall Street's Bailout Act of 2009”, which aims to impose a 0.25% transaction tax on the “sale and purchase of financial instruments such as stock, options, and futures.

Ladies and gentlemen, 0.25% is

50 basis points

round-trip. Few if any statistical arbitrage strategies can survive this transaction tax.

And no, this is not "Wall Street paying for Wall Street's Bailout". This is small-time independent trader-entrepreneur like ourselves paying for Wall Street's Bailout.

Furthermore, this tax will drain the US market of liquidity, and ultimately will cost every investor, long or short term, a far greater transaction cost than 0.25%.
