posted an interesting article this morning by Michael Lewis, one of my favorite authors, about

[the evolution of Blaine Lourd's financial career](http://www.portfolio.com/executives/features/2007/11/19/Blaine-Lourd-Profile?print=true)

. Just a couple of interested excerpts:

> The traders in New York would accumulate a block of shares, driving the price up, and then get brokers like Blaine to unload the shares quickly at the higher price—whereupon the price would, often as not, fall. "Seven months in at Lehman, I was one of the top rookie producers," Blaine says, "but every stock I bought went down."

> Nobody knows which company will prove a good long-term investment. Even Buffett’s genius lies more in running businesses than in picking stocks. But in the investing world, that is ignored. Wall Street, with its army of brokers, analysts, and advisers funneling trillions of dollars into mutual funds, hedge funds, and private equity funds, is an elaborate fraud. [italics my own]

> A.G. Edwards was not happy. Blaine was still generating profits for his firm. Of the 6,000 A.G. Edwards brokers, he still ranked in the top 30\. But for every dollar that passed through his hands, he was slicing off a surprisingly small piece for himself and A.G. Edwards. This brought a letter from the head of sales, saying that while managers appreciated how much revenue he generated, they wanted to see him generate 10 percent more. They want me to churn these accounts, he thought. He fired off an angry reply and refused to trade. A few months later, he received a visit from a local manager. It makes the Securities and Exchange Commission unhappy, the manager said, to see brokers getting paid for doing nothing. The U.S. government wanted Blaine to churn his accounts. “At that point,” he says, "I was done."

> ...and *SmartMoney’s* cover story "Seven Best Mutual Funds for 1996," whose selections later underperformed the market by 6.7 percent. In 1997, SmartMoney found seven new best mutual fund managers. They finished 3.4 percent below the market. In 1998, the magazine’s newest best funds came in 2.2 percent below the market. Soon after, Wellington says, "*SmartMoney* stopped its annual survey of the best mutual fund managers."
