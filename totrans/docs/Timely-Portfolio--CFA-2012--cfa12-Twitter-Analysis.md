# Timely Portfolio: CFA 2012 #cfa12 Twitter Analysis

> 来源：[http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2012/05/cfa-2012-cfa12-twitter-analysis.html#0001-01-01](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2012/05/cfa-2012-cfa12-twitter-analysis.html#0001-01-01)

Inspired by the bloggers [isomorphismes](http://isomorphismes.tumblr.com/post/20362455367/twitter) and [OUseful.Info](http://blog.ouseful.info/2012/02/15/generating-twitter-wordclouds-in-r-prompted-by-an-open-learning-blogpost/), I thought it would be fun to analyze Twitter use of #cfa12 during the [CFA Institute 65th Annual Conference](http://www.cfainstitute.org/learning/products/events/Pages/05062012_52432.aspx) in Chicago last week.  At last year’s conference, there was virtually no tweeting, so I was amazed at the exponential growth in tweeting this year and also at the number of lit screens during each session.

I’m not sure if I should be proud or embarrassed at being ranked as the #2 most prolific tweeter.

I think this is an ugly chart, but I thought I would include as another example.

By time, tweeting activity looks like this.  I really struggled with trying to facet tweet activity by day with the hour of the day as the x-axis.  If anyone accomplishes this, I would love to see it.

Overall, I think the conference was extremely well done.
