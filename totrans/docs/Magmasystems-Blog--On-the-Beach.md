# Magmasystems Blog: On the Beach

I have been trying to fly out to a beach for the past few weeks, but every time I reserve a plane, the weather craps out. Had a plane reserved for today, but we have the remnants of Hurricane Ernesto. It is supposed to be an amazing day tomorrow, so I will try to make Ocean City, NJ.

There are a few beaches on the East Coast that you can fly to. Our favorite is

[Block Island](http://www.airnav.com/airport/KBID)

, Rhode Island, right off the eastern tip of Long Island and about 1h15m from

[MMU](http://www.mmuair.com/)

. Block Island is only reachable by ferry, and hence, the beaches are relatively less crowded than your typical East Coast beach.

Other beaches that have airports within walking distance include Provincetown (Mass), Ocean City (NJ), Katana (Martha's Vineyard).
