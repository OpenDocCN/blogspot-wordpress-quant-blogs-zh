, former employee of Nassim Taleb, has run the Universa Hedge fund for a while and seems to be doing quite well for himself (he bought Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony's old home in Bel Air). What his returns have been I don't know, but they are always reported second-hand when vol spikes (as usual regulation is the opposite of helpful here, discouraging hedge fund reporting that would allow investors to more accurately estimate returns for various strategies).

Anyway, Taleb's Black Swan investment advice seemed to be a barbell strategy with a lot of something really safe balanced by radical risky investments. Because people don't appreciate the magnitude or frequency of infrequent events, these low-probability but large impact events offer good returns. In this white paper,

[Austrians of a Feather](http://universa.net/UniversaSpitznagel_research_201205.pdf)

, Spitznagel seems to be saying that doesn't work. He seems enamored by Austrian business cycle theory, and an unfortunate side effect of which is to abjure clarity and concision. Thus I'm not sure what he's trying to say, but it seems he is saying that tail risk, out-of-the-money options and their ilk, are fairly priced if not overpriced. The real market opportunity is in predicting specific Black Swans. In other words,

**speculating**

on rare events, as opposed to presuming rare events are under appreciated in general.

 Taleb is listed rather prominently on the

[Universa Website](http://www.universa.net/)

and Spitznagel graciously credits Taleb in the paper, but Taleb and/or Spitznagel have put a fork in the archetypal Black Swan theory (and yet, Taleb has never been really consistent, so one can say he meant this all along at some level). I have no doubt some people can predict infrequent events, and perhaps Spitznagel is one of them. Yet it's pretty hard to validate objectively, and in my experienced is best done via observing all the little good investments someone has made for 10 years, something that is impossible to do in scale. The idea that

**if**

you can predict infrequent events you can do very well for yourself is true enough, but that's a lot less useful to know than if rare events are unappreciated in general, which turns out not be be true.
