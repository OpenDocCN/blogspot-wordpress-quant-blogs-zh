# Blend 3 Image Annoyance | Tales from a Trading Desk

## Blend 3 Image Annoyance

I ran into an annoying problem with Blend 3 recently. In design mode if you reference an image ([Source](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.image.source.aspx) property) the design surface will show the image even if you don’t have the image linked into the project/solution. What this means is that in design mode everything looks fine, but on running the applications you don’t see a lot 😦
