# Quantifiable Edges: SPY Extended To The Point That Often Leads To A Pullback

> 来源：[http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2013/10/spy-extended-to-point-that-often-leads.html#0001-01-01](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2013/10/spy-extended-to-point-that-often-leads.html#0001-01-01)

SPY has now gone 12 days without closing below its 5ma. The study below is one I’ve shown a few times over the years.  It looks at other instances in which SPY has traded above the 5ma for at least 2 weeks and is now closing at a 10-day high. All results are updated.

In the past this setup has commonly been followed by a short-term pullback. The downside edge doesn't last long, though. It seems to pretty much play itself out over the first 2 days.  It is not an overwhelming edge, but it is still worth noting that SPY has been short-term extended for a while and the normal course of action at this point is a little pullback.
