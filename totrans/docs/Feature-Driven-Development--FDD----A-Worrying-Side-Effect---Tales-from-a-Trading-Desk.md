## Feature Driven Development (FDD) – A Worrying Side Effect

[FDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature-driven_development) has been around for some time.  Although Scrum is more common, its not unusual to hear the Scrum [theme](http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/stories-epics-and-themes) described as feature.  This leads to somewhat of a problem in some scenarios.  Specifically, teams get driven down a feature road, where the Product Owner perceives all he wants is features, and begins to drive for features, sometimes at the mercy of accepting partially [tested](http://blogs.lmax.com/staff-blogs/2014/04/testinglmax-time-travel-tardis/) software within a fractured environment that bears no resemblance to the final deliverable state.  Feature madness.  Mentorship and education should be consider in these scenarios.

Rally [offers](https://help.rallydev.com/top-10-mistakes-teams) the Top 10 Mistakes Made by New Agile Teams – 6 and 8 are of particular worry 😦   I wonder how many teams still makes these mistakes.
