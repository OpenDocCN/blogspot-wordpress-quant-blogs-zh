# CoCoMo – Microsoft? AIR – ArrowHead? | Tales from a Trading Desk

## CoCoMo – Microsoft? AIR – ArrowHead?

Having watched this [video](https://admin.adobe.acrobat.com/_a300965365/p86262461/) I’m curious to know what Microsoft is going to offer in the collab space for [Silverlight](http://silverlight.net/)? Adobe’s AIR release (also check out Mozilla <a href=”[Prism](http://labs.mozilla.com/2007/10/prism/)“>Prism) has take the fight to the desktop – Microsoft’s home turf. Is [ArrowHead](http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/?p=818) the answer? Or is ArrowHead just for WPF? Lets hope [MIX08](http://visitmix.com/) provides some insight into how Microsoft will fight back in this battle.
