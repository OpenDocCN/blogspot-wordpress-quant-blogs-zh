# Humble Student of the Markets: What investors and traders should think about in 2024

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2023/12/what-investors-and-traders-should-think.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2023/12/what-investors-and-traders-should-think.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models** 

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post, 

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The 

**Trend Asset Allocation Model**

 is an asset allocation model that applies trend-following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity prices. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. The performance and full details of a model portfolio based on the out-of-sample signals of the Trend Model can be found

[here](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/trend-model-report-card/)

.

My inner trader uses a 

**trading model**

, which is a blend of price momentum (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa). Subscribers receive real-time alerts of model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of the email alerts is updated weekly 

[here](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/trading-track-record/)

. The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that began in March 2016 is shown below.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Buy equities (Last changed from “sell” on 28-Jul-2023)*
*   Trend Model signal: Bullish (Last changed from “neutral” on 28-Jul-2023)*
*   Trading model: Bullish (Last changed from “neutral” on 20-Nov-2023)*

#### A temporary blip

It appears that the best explanation for Wednesday's sudden market downdraft was same-day option related activity (0DTE) that forced market makers to hedge by selling equities. From a longer-term context, analysis from

[Bespoke](https://twitter.com/bespokeinvest/status/1737830956612919432)

indicates that similar hiccups in strong bull trends haven't done damage.

With that in mind, here are the issues to consider as we look ahead into 2024 on differing time horizons.
