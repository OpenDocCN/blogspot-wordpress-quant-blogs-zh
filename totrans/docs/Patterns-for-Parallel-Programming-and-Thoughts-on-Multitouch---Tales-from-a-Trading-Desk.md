## Patterns for Parallel Programming and Thoughts on Multitouch

I’ve not downloaded P[atterns for Parallel Programming](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=86b3d32b-ad26-4bb8-a3ae-c1637026c3ee&displaylang=en): Understanding and Applying Parallel Patterns with the .NET Framework 4 yet, but suspect its worth a [read](http://blogs.msdn.com/pfxteam/archive/2009/10/31/9915569.aspx).

DDJ “Multitouch Gains Momentum” article provides some thoughts on multitouch. The article doesn’t mention that [Silverlight](http://timheuer.com/blog/archive/2009/07/30/silverlight-3-multi-touch-introduction-fundamentals-basics.aspx) also supports multitouch, which is a shame given that RIA’s are the preferred application of choice in certain instances. If you now look at the 10/GUI [video](http://10gui.com/), you can begin to see some interesting ideas for the next generation trading desk.
