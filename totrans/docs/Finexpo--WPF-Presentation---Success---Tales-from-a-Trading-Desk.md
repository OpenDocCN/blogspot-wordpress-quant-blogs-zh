## Finexpo: WPF Presentation – Success

Thanks to the effort of a number of people in [Lab49](http://www.lab49.com/), the presentation today at [Finexpo](http://www.finexpo.com/cts2006/seminar.asp?s_id=123) appeared to be well received – we even got a clapped at the end.  It was pretty cool to be the only non-Microsoft people speaking as part of the [Microsoft City Developer track](http://www.finexpo.com/cts2006/seminar_list.asp). The turnout wasn’t spectacular, but then we are talking a fairly niche market.   The slides and demo should be available shortly.
