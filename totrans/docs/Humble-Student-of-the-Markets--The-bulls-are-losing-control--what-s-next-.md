# Humble Student of the Markets: The bulls are losing control, what's next?

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2020/05/the-bulls-are-losing-control-whats-next.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2020/05/the-bulls-are-losing-control-whats-next.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models**

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post,

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The

**Trend Asset Allocation Model**

is an asset allocation model which applies trend following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or contraction (bearish)?"

My inner trader uses a

**trading model**

, which is a blend of price momentum (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa). Subscribers receive real-time alerts of model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of the those email alerts are updated weekly

. The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that began in March 2016 is shown below.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Sell equities*
*   Trend Model signal: Bearish*
*   Trading model: Neutral*

.

**A sideways pattern**

Stock prices have been chopping sideways and gone nowhere in the past month. After a strong rally off the March low, the rally stalled repeatedly at the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level while the stochastic recycled from an overbought condition. It is becoming evident that the bulls have lost control. That doesn't mean, however, that the market is ready to go down. Instead, the sideways consolidation could continue for some time.

What's next? Will we see further chop sideways, or have the bears seized control of the tape?
