# Quantifiable Edges: Turnaround Tuesday?

> 来源：[http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2011/04/turnaround-tuesday.html#0001-01-01](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2011/04/turnaround-tuesday.html#0001-01-01)

With the SPX now falling 3 days in a row I'm begining to see signs that a bounce is becoming likely.  One bit of evidence identified by the Quantifinder last night was based on the "Turnaround Tuesday" concept. 

I’ve shown before that [of all days Tuesday has historically had the highest propensity to halt a short-term pullback](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2009/01/turnaround-tuesdays.html).  The study below is specific to a 3-day pullback leading up to a Tuesday.  It was last seen in the blog on [August 24, 2010](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2010/08/turnaround-tuesday.html).  I've updated the results. Results still appear to strongly favor the bulls.  The market is looking at a gap down this morning so it will be interesting to see if it can overcome the negaive momentum and make the turnaround today or in the next few days.
