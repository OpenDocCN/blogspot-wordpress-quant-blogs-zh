# Magmasystems Blog: Some Summer Reading

A great read on the collapse of Bear Stearns in this month's issue of

[Vanity Fair](http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2008/08/bear_stearns200808)

.

More on the Vanity Fair article at the

[New York Times](http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/30/what-really-killed-bear-stearns/)

.

Especially interesting is the part of the Vanity Fair article where they talk about dealing with CNBC. There is really too much power given to the CNBC correspondents. Give one correspondent an interview, and the other correspondents will snipe at your company on the air.
