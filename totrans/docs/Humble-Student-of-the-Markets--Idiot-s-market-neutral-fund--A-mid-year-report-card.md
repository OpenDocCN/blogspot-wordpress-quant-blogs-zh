*smart funds*

hasn’t changed significantly since my last

in late April.

*Smart funds*

continue to be more defensive. The managers of these funds seem to believe that the worst may not be over for the US economy.

As the chart below shows,

*smart fund*

Smart funds continue to be underweight Financials, while consensus funds are slightly overweight:
