## Agile IT Organization Design

I’ve been carrying around [Agile IT Organization Design](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Agile-Organization-Design-Transformation-Continuous/dp/0133903354) for some time, but never managed to quick complete the book due to time.  Interestingly, at the Construx Executive [Summit](http://www.construx.com/Thought_Leadership/Events/Software_Executive_Summit/?id=16269) last week, one of the discussion group was centred around Organizational Structures – quite timely.  Of particular interest:

*   Page 58 – Cross functional teams, with reference to Apple and Spotify
*   Page 69 – Matrix structures are not suitable of continuous delivery
*   Page 97 – Organization chart debt 😦
*   Page 107 – Both IT and business need to align together.  Both need each other.
*   Page 109 – Issues with Plan Driven projects.
*   Page 117 – Value-drive projects
*   Page 132 – Agile budgeting – should be an interesting read for most.
*   Page 141 – Better staffing – cross-functional (poly-skilled) people rather than a cross-functional team of specialists.
*   Page 145 – Developer skill profile.
*   Page 145 – Avoid part-time assignments – couldn’t agree more.
*   Page 159 – Metrics.  The higher up the food chain, the more management want metrics.  Unfortunately software engineering is a social activity, and doesn’t lend itself very well to measurements.  This subject again ties nicely back to Steve McConnell’s Construx summit keynote.
