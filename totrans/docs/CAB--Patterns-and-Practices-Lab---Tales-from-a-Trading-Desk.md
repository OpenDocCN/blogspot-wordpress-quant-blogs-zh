## CAB: Patterns and Practices Lab

Sounds like the P&P [team](http://channel9.msdn.com/showpost.aspx?postid=238321) is very agile/extreme. Nice to see their flat desks are “pair” suitable :). Movable walls (white boards), very cool. It’s unfortunate the some investment banks have cubicals, limited white boards and lack of conference rooms :(. Scrum, iterative development etc, Microsoft appear to be getting it finally.
