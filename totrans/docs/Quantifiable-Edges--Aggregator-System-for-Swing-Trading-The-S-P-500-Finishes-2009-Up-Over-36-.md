# Quantifiable Edges: Aggregator System for Swing Trading The S&P 500 Finishes 2009 Up Over 36%

A couple of months ago

[I discussed the Aggregator System on the blog](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2009/10/quantifying-value-of-historical.html)

for the 1st time. The

[Quantifiable Edges Aggregator is a tool](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2008/07/quantifiable-edges-aggregator.html)

I introduced just after I began publishing the Subscriber Letter. The Aggregator tool looks at two things:

1) The net expectations from the active studies published in the Subscriber Letter and on the blog over the next few days.

2) The performance of the S&P versus expectations over the prior few days.

The Aggregator System produces mechanical signals based on the values supplied by the Quantifiable Edges Aggregator. Its signals are based on the S&P 500 cash index and all trades are assumed to take place at the close.

While it can sometimes be difficult to anticipate whether that night’s research will suggest a bullish or bearish tilt and whether it will be enough to shift net expectations, I have been able to incorporate the Intraday

[Quantifinder](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2009/05/quantifinder-unveiled.html)

into the process to get a fairly accurate read on what the Aggregator is likely to signal that night.

“Probable” signals are published on the Quantifiable Edges systems page about 10-15 minutes before the bell each day. I’ve been publishing them for nearly 4 months now and to this point I believe there has only been one instance where the “probable” signal was switched based on that night’s research.

Once the “probable” signal is posted each day I typically send out notification and a link via Twitter to alert subscribers.

When I first discussed the Aggregator System on the blog in October it was trying to fight out of an 8% drawdown. It did manage to do so and it finished 2009 at a new high. The total reinvested (hypothetical – not including commissions/dividends/interest on cash) return for 2009 was 36.27%. The Quantifiable Edges Subscriber Letter began publishing on 2/25/2008 so that is as far back as Aggregator values go. Total returns for the partial (10+ months) year of 2008 was 60.20%. Therefore the total compounded profits since inception have been 118.31%.
