## Silverlight Is Much More Than A Browser Technology

There is much noise around if Microsoft Silverlight will continue as a platform. I think this post by Brad summaries Microsoft’s view of where [Silverlight](http://team.silverlight.net/announcement/the-future-of-silverlight/) is now heading:

*“Silverlight is much more than a browser technology. There are three areas of investment for Silverlight outside the browser: the desktop, the mobile device, and the living room”*

Reading between the lines, I see Silverlight as replacing WPF on the [desktop](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iI47b3a9cEI&feature=player_embedded). Silverlight is still important as an RIA – “On the web, the purpose of Silverlight has never been to replace HTML; it’s to do the things that HTML (and other technologies) couldn’t in a way that was easy for developers to tap into”.
