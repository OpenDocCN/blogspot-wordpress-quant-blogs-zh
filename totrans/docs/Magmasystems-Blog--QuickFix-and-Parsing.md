# Magmasystems Blog: QuickFix and Parsing

> 来源：[http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2007/04/quickfix-and-parsing.html#0001-01-01](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2007/04/quickfix-and-parsing.html#0001-01-01)

I am amazed that, in the .NET API that QuickFix offers, there is no method or MessageFactory that will take an arbitrary FIX string and return a FIX message object of the proper type. Am I missing something?

I believe that FIX4NET has this functionality, but they do not support FIX 4.4.

We have to petition Mike Roberts to get a .NET version of the TTConnect FIX Engine.
