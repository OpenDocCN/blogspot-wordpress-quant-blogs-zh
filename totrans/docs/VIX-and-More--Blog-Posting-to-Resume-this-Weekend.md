# VIX and More: Blog Posting to Resume this Weekend

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2011/02/blog-posting-to-resume-this-weekend.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2011/02/blog-posting-to-resume-this-weekend.html#0001-01-01)

Thanks to all who have inquired about my absence and health.  It turns out that I have been under the weather, then taking some time off.  Originally I had intended to post more intermittently rather than coming to a complete stop, but now I am back to a normal posting schedule.

The recent [volatility spike](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20spikes) has generated dozens of questions and I will try to address as many of those as possible as posting begins to return to normal this weekend.  I have also managed to fall far behind on emails and blog comments and will do my best to get caught up in this department as soon as I can.

In the interim, for those who are new to *VIX and More* or may be looking to cherry pick some of the best posts from the past in order to help shed light on the current situation, the following will certainly be of interest:

Note also that for certain posts which have a comprehensive retrospective view of content in the blog (such as this one) or critical market events, I have labeled these with an '

' label.  Just click on the link to pull up all posts with a similar label.  For more basic educational content, try the '

[educational](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/educational)

' label.  Finally,  for those who are interested in posts on specific subjects, use the hyperlinks for subjects such as

, etc.

Of course there is also the custom Google search bar in the right hand column just below the CBOE:RMC ad for specific keyword searches on this site.  Which reminds me, I will be attending the aforementioned CBOE Risk Management Conference.  If you are a reader and wish to say hello, this is an excellent time to do it.
