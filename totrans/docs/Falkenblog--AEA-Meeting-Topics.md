# Falkenblog: AEA Meeting Topics

> 来源：[http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2010/12/aea-meeting-topics.html#0001-01-01](http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2010/12/aea-meeting-topics.html#0001-01-01)

[Hundreds of papers](http://www.aeaweb.org/aea/2011conference/program/preliminary.php)

are being presented, and more than a few are sure to be very interesting, so keep up to date as the papers get filled in (they post the papers online, so you don't actually have to go). Think of it like a flea market: mainly junk, but some real finds if you look around. Many have straightforward groupings like "Banks, Credit Constraints and International Business Cycles" and "Optimal Fiscal Policy", where there are usally 3 papers that address the issue. Then there's this grouping, the ubiquitous 'other' category:

> Five Unrelated but Interesting Papers
> 
> Driving Under the (Cellular) Influence
> 
> Do Public Subsidies Sell Green Cars? Evidence from the U.S. Cash for Clunkers Program
> 
> A History of Violence: The "Culture of Honor" as a Determinant of Homicide in the U.S. South
> 
> The Lion's Share: An Experimental Analysis of Polygamy in Northern Nigeria
> 
> White Men Can't Jump, But Would You Bet on It?
