# Humble Student of the Markets: A step-wise market advance

**Mid-week market update**

: In my post written last Sunday (see

[September uncertainties](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2017/09/03/september-uncertainties/)

), I outlined three disparate sources of uncertainty that faced investors in September.

*   Legislative uncertainty over the debt ceiling and tax reform;
*   Geopolitical uncertainty over North Korea; and
*   Uncertainty over Fed action.

While some of those problems have been temporarily resolved, developments since the weekend have raised further questions about others. This suggests that the market will follow the recent pattern of a stepwise advance, but remain range-bound pattern until many of these uncertainties are resolved.
