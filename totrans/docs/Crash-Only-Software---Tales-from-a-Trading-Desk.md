## Crash-Only Software

Although rather an old [paper](http://static.usenix.org/events/hotos03/tech/full_papers/candea/candea.pdf), still worth a read.

> A crash-only system makes it affordable to transform every detected failure into component-level crashes; this leads to a simple fault model, and components only need to know how to recover from one type of failure.

There paper provides further interesting reading via the references.
