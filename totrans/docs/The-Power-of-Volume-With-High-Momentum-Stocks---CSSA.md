The following chart shows the impact of using only the 5-day volume change or ROC of volume to trade the  Livermore Top 10 unhedged.  As you can see, the returns and risk-adjusted returns are very impressive for such a simple condition–exceeding the returns from buying using other simple conditions such as up/down days or buying on 5-day ROC<0.  I have not had much time to do thorough research, but it appears so far that consistent with practitioner theory–volume is a big key to timing high momentum stocks.
