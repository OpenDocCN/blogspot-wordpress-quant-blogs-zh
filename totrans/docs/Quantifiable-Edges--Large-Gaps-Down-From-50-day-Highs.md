# Quantifiable Edges: Large Gaps Down From 50-day Highs

Big gap down from yesterday's high.  Below is one way to look at it.

These results were similar to a few scenarios I ran.  The evidence suggests no edge in trying to buy the low open.  In fact there may be a bit of a downside edge from open to close today.  Historically, things have gotten worse throughout the day.
