## Speak at Microsoft ISU EMEA FY10

I’m currently putting together a slide deck for the ISU FY10 [conference](https://secure.lenos.com/lenos/attendeetech/FY10EMEAISU/home.htm) (3rd Nov 2009) – Next Generation eTrading with Silverlight. The 20 minute session should give the audience a clear idea of the benefits of Silverlight in the world of Capital Markets.

ISU provides attendees worldwide with customised training from leading customers, partners and industry experts. Attendees will leave with the latest tools to increase revenue and impact customer and partner satisfaction. The event combines industry-specific thought leadership with fast-paced, interactive learning to generate enthusiasm around efforts, results and the field organisation community.
