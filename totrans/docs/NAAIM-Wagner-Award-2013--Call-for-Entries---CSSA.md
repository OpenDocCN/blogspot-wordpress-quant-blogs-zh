The National Association of Active Investment Managers (NAAIM) has announced the call for papers in the 2013 Wagner Award paper competition. In its fifth year, the Wagner Award promotes awareness of active investment management techniques and the results of active strategies through the solicitation and publication of research on active management.

A $10,000 grand prize will be awarded to the best paper that critically looks at how investors might better manage portfolios during market downturns, yet still capitalize on the market’s periods of superior performance. Papers must be of practical significance to practitioners of active investing.

The competition is open to all investment practitioners, academic faculty and doctoral candidates in the field. The goal of the Wagner Award is to provide academic substantiation of the viability of active management and evidence of the validity of active investing.
