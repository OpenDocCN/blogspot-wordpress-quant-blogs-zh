**Mid-week market update:**

I have been calling for a relief rally, followed by a deeper correction (see

[Why I am both bullish and bearish](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2023/08/20/why-i-am-both-bullish-and-bearish/)

). The relief rally seems to have arrived as the S&P 500 breached the upper trend line of a falling channel while exhibiting improvements in new 52-week high breadth.

How far can the rally run?
