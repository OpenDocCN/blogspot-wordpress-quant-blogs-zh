# Humble Student of the Markets: Will stock prices surge on a Fed rate cut?

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2019/07/will-stock-prices-surge-on-fed-rate-cut.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2019/07/will-stock-prices-surge-on-fed-rate-cut.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models**

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post,

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The

**Trend Model**

is an asset allocation model which applies trend following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or contraction (bearish)?"

My inner trader uses a

**trading model**

, which is a blend of price momentum (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa). Subscribers receive real-time alerts of model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of the those email alerts are updated weekly

. The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that began in March 2016 is shown below.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Buy equities*
*   Trend Model signal: Neutral*
*   Trading model: Bearish*

.

**A well-telegraphed rate cut**

As we look forward to the FOMC meeting on July 30-31, the market is discounting a 100% chance of a rate cut, with the probability of a half point cut at 22.5%.

Analysis from Ned Davis Research reveals that an initial rate cut and no recession has historically lit a rocket under stock prices.

What will happen this time? Should investors be piling into equities in anticipation of a market surge?
