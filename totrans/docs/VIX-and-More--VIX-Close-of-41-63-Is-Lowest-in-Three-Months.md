# VIX and More: VIX Close of 41.63 Is Lowest in Three Months

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/12/vix-close-of-4163-is-lowest-in-three.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/12/vix-close-of-4163-is-lowest-in-three.html#0001-01-01)

The last time the VIX closed below 42.00 was way back on October 1^(st), when the VIX closed at 39.81.

Before anyone gets excited about the possibility of the VIX back in the 30s, I should note that the [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures) continue to reflect expectations of a rising VIX over the course of at least the next 2-3 months. Today’s VIX January futures settled at 44.18 and the February futures settled at 45.08\. Futures for August through October are now priced in the 37-38 range, however, suggesting that volatility expectations are being lowered for the second half of 2009.
