# Quantifiable Edges: A Strong Move Up Ahead Of OpEx

> 来源：[http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2012/06/strong-move-up-ahead-of-opex.html#0001-01-01](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2012/06/strong-move-up-ahead-of-opex.html#0001-01-01)

It is a little unusual to see the market close so strongly just ahead of options expiration.  And when it has happened it has typically led to selling over the next few days.  The study below shows this.  I last showed it on the blog in January.  All stats have been updated.

Numbers here are moderately compelling and suggest a downside edge.
