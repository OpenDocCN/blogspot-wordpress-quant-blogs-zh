# “Off-Roading” Software Engineer | Tales from a Trading Desk

## “Off-Roading” Software Engineer

I’ve Twittered Shanley’s recent “Productivity Myth” [previous](https://medium.com/about-work/1cd9fbf8ca15), but its worth a further comment.  Specifically, the 3rd bullet point, which I think is in some cases more appropriately termed “off-roading” from the original plan/delivery/iteration/milestone.  Unfortunately, unless you have clue’d up team leaders, or project managers that come from a development background, a lot of off-roading is hard to spot.  Consider this in the same context as the never ending morning stand-up “refactoring” bad smell.
