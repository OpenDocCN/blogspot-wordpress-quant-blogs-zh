## Listen to the system

### June 29, 2007

One of the mantras I chant to myself when debugging is “listen to the system”. My hope is to remind myself to read the error messages, and examine the symptoms,  without preconceptions. Often, when debugging, there is a eureka moment, when we figure the root cause of the problem. At that point we realise that we’ve ignored error messages that didn’t fit with our early guesses at the nature of the problem.

I imagine it must be similar for traders – they need to listen to the market, and try to keep an open mind as to causes and consequences as they observe price action.
