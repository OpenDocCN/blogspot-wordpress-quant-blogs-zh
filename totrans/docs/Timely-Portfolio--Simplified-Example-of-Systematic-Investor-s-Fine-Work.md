# Timely Portfolio: Simplified Example of Systematic Investor’s Fine Work

> 来源：[http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2012/02/simplified-example-of-systematic.html#0001-01-01](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2012/02/simplified-example-of-systematic.html#0001-01-01)

THIS IS ONLY AN EXAMPLE AND IS NOT INVESTMENT ADVICE. ACTING ON THIS WILL LOSE LOTS OF MONEY.

[Systematic Investor Blog](http://systematicinvestor.wordpress.com/) (be sure to check out the site) offers extremely good examples of how to use R in finance.  Since I firmly believe more examples are always better, I wanted to provide an additional very simple example of how to use his [Systematic Investor Toolbox (SIT)](https://github.com/systematicinvestor/SIT) for systems development.  This will provide a building block for a series of posts similar to my [A Quantstrat to Build On Part 6](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2011/07/quantstrat-to-build-on-part-6.html).  We’ll use our good old count up/down (CUD) indicator on the S&P 500 Index and compare it to [Mebane Faber’s](http://www.mebanefaber.com) 10 month moving average.

I know this is not pretty, but I wanted to start with as simple a base as possible.  Any loyal readers will already have known that CUD is not so great at making money.
