# VIX and More: Post-Employment Report Links

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/10/post-employment-report-links.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/10/post-employment-report-links.html#0001-01-01)

As is usually the case here, in these [links](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/links) I give preference to material that focuses on the VIX and volatility, options, market sentiment, and ETFs.

That being said, three areas that I will likely give more weight to going forward are behavioral economics, risk management and psychology. The expanding focus is largely because I believe the opportunity for improvement in these subjects is so much greater for most traders than it is in enhancing existing quantitative skill sets and the like.

Some of my favorite posts from the past few days:
