[Brett Steenberger](http://traderfeed.blogspot.com/2018/05/the-dangers-of-false-knowledge.html)

recently warned that traders about trading on noise, which is advice to which I wholeheartedly agree:

> In other words, before we can determine whether or not we have an edge (in systematic or discretionary trading), we need to establish knowledge. A theory explains how and why something occurs. Testing of historical data can help us conduct limited, targeted tests to determine whether our theory holds up in practice. Before we test, we must formulate a plausible hypothesis. There is no theoretical or practical rationale why many strategies in technical analysis, fundamental analysis, or random combinations of quantitative variables should be valid.

With that caveat, I offer two offbeat forecasts for the markets for this coming Thursday and Friday.
