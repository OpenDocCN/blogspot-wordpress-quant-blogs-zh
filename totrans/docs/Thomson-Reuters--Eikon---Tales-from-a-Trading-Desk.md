# Thomson Reuters: Eikon | Tales from a Trading Desk

## Thomson Reuters: Eikon

Looks like Thomson Reuters is doing well with the [Eikon](http://thomsonreuters.com/press-releases/072013/Thomson-Reuters-Eikon-Becomes-First-Native-Market-Data-App-for-BlackBerry-10) platform.  With its recent release on the Blackberry 10, its mobile strategy is nicely covering the business community devices – Pad, iPhone and previous BlackBerry devices, with [Android](http://www.wallstreetandtech.com/data-management/will-thomson-reuters-eikon-app-woo-wall/240158762) support being offered in the near future.  Blackberry World offers a few [screen](http://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/32066887/) shots of the application itself, coupled with a brief overview of the functionality – no trading appears to be supported from the Blackberry 10.  More screen shots and info on Eikon is available over on the Thomson Reuters [site](https://thomsonreuterseikon.com/features/market-analysis-app/).  I’d be curious if anyone know what Eikon uses for streaming prices to the mobile devices

Wall Street & Technology [captures](http://www.wallstreetandtech.com/data-management/will-thomson-reuters-eikon-app-woo-wall/240158762) an important part of the Eikon “sell” via Berryview:

> This gives Eikon subscribers (an alternative to Bloomberg terminals) access to real time financial markets data on their BlackBerry 10 device. Best of all it comes in a fast and fluid native UI experience
