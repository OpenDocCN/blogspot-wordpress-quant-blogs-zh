## Leinweber’s Nerds

### October 21, 2009

I had high hopes for David Leinweber’s [Nerds on Wall St](http://nerdsonwallstreet.typepad.com), but have been disappointed. It’s just a collection of trade press articles, with no deep insight offered anywhere. I suppose it highlights the fact that there still isn’t a definitive financial technology book, in the way there are classic sales and trading books like Liars Poker, Fooled by Randomness, Education of a Speculator or Trading and Exchanges.

I guess Leinweber has a lot of good industry contacts and influence: I can see no other explanation for the glowing testimonials [cited here](http://nerdsonwallstreet.typepad.com).
