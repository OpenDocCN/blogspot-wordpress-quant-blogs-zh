Hi David,

New to the site and catching up on the posts. Fascinating stuff. Two questions. 1) Are these results posted above based on the hedged or un-hedged version? 2) What are the current results for the other version — meaning if 23.73% is the hedged version, what would it be for the un-hedged, or vice versa?

Thanks and I look forward to exploring more on your site.
