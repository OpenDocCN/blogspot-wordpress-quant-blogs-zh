# Falkenblog: Dendreon Drop Overdue

I'm a long term bear, but there's no double-dip on the horizon, just endless slog. Thus, I'm buying here.

As per

[Dendreon](http://www.google.com//finance?chdnp=1&chdd=1&chds=1&chdv=1&chvs=maximized&chdeh=0&chfdeh=0&chdet=1312488000000&chddm=1173&chls=IntervalBasedLine&q=NASDAQ:DNDN&ntsp=0)

(DNDN), the stock that lost 65% of it's value yesterday based on lower earnings guidance, I think it was well overdue. It

had

a $6B market cap based on no current earnings and one drug,

[Provenge](http://www.webmd.com/prostate-cancer/news/20100429/fda-oks-provenge-prostate-cancer-therapy)

, which was shown to increase the age of prostate cancer victims by 4.1 months. The price tag is a staggering $93k, which supposedly was going to be paid by US taxpayers, as by law Medicare does not take into account a drug's cost when considering if it will pay for it (which they said they would)!

I think we are broke enough to tell men if they don't have and want to spend the $93k, you're just going to die a little sooner from this cause, which is what non-Medicare patients will do. The FDA

[study](http://www.fda.gov/downloads/biologicsbloodvaccines/cellulargenetherapyproducts/approvedproducts/ucm214540.pdf)

shows people living 25 rather than 21 months, which I don't think is a good buy. I would bet most people would rather leave their family $93k more than live in agony another 4 months, but in our crazy health care market no one pays for anything out-of-pocket, so they feel insulted to actually have to make the decision. If we really just wanted to prioritize life enhancing dollars, we could increase it more than 4 months by simply giving everyone access to aerobics classes and a dietitian, which would cost much less.
