# Quantifiable Edges: Intermediate-Term Highs Prior to Fed Days

> 来源：[http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2012/01/intermediate-term-highs-prior-to-fed.html#0001-01-01](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2012/01/intermediate-term-highs-prior-to-fed.html#0001-01-01)

Wednesday is a Fed Day.  As I have discussed many times, Fed Days generally carry an upside tendency.  But this tendency is greatly impacted by certain variables.  A large collection of these variables may be found here on the blog under the

[“Fed Day”label](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/search/label/Fed%20Study)

.  And many more may be found in the “

[Quantifiable Edges Guide to Fed Days](http://www.quantifiableedges.com/fedguide)

”.

One variable I briefly discussed in the

[11/3/10 blog](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2010/11/fed-days-with-market-at-intermediate.html)

was whether the market was already at an intermediate-term high.  Today I thought I would illustrate that study graphically.

First, let’s take an updated look at SPX performance on Fed Days when the SPX has NOT closed at a 20-day high the day before.

That’s basically 30 years of bullishness.

But now let’s see performance at times when the SPX ***did*** close at a 20-day high the day before.

No consistency and no pronounced edge in this sample of 36 instances.

Traders looking to play for a short-term Fed Day bump should be hoping the SPX does not close up and at a new high again today.
