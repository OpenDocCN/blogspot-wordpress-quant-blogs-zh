![](img/bb11bc821251772bcd4890048896a6d7.png)Brett Steenbarger’s [TraderFeed](http://traderfeed.blogspot.com/) blog is a superb resource for data-driven market analysis as well as a review of many of the important psychological aspects of trading.

I found two recent posts and a promised next installment on trader performance to be particularly insightful.  In [How Common Is Elite Talent Among Day Traders?](http://traderfeed.blogspot.com/2008/01/how-common-is-elite-talent-among-day.html) Brett cited [a study](http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/odean/papers/Day%20Traders/Day%20Trade%20040330.pdf) which determined that 80% of day traders lose money.  In today’s follow-up, [What Makes an Expert? Three Surprising Research Conclusions](http://traderfeed.blogspot.com/2008/01/what-makes-expert-three-surprising.html), Brett concludes that repeatable success can best be attributed to those traders who essentially develop what I would call a closed-loop feedback system and strive for continuous improvement.

The bottom line is that superior trading is not the result of intelligence, tools or a holy grail setup.  Instead, top performance is the result of the efforts of those who do the best job of developing and applying a process that takes maximum advantage of experience and learning opportunities to develop and refine one’s edge.  In Brett’s words, it’s all about a “structured learning process.”  Brett has promised that he will offer up his thinking on what sort of structured learning process would be ideal for traders and when he does, I will be quick to weigh in with my thoughts.
