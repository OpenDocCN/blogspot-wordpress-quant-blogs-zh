Jon Vol sent me a little email saying he has a

on Taleb, and that it got

[picked up](http://www.blackswanreport.com/blog/2013/05/false-prophet-nostradamus-and-the-financial-crisis-quixotic-finance/)

by a Taleb fansite, where at the bottom it is classified as "Filed Haters || Tagged Falkenstein." I'm not just

*a*

Hater, but rather, a type that can be applied to others! I wonder what our distinguishing characteristic is in their eyes?

 Now that wrestling is trying to get back into the Olympics, they are considering

[getting rid of singlets](http://www.examiner.com/article/fila-seeks-adding-women-s-weight-classes-shirtless-greco-grapplers-for-olympics)

! I'd say, it's about time. Singlets simply aren't cool, and if high school kids suited up like cage-fighters I think the sport would be more popular.

 Heritage's dismissal of Jason Richwine is pretty rich indeed. To recap, he coauthored a study critical of immigration, basically saying that the new immigrants from Mexico would receive more benefits than generate in taxes. Someone looked up his 2009 dissertation, and it had the racy title 'IQ and Immigration Policy.'

 It's truly a taboo topic, as demonstrated by his Harvard thesis adviser and famous labor economist George Borjas saying 'I have never worked on anything even remotely related to IQ, so don’t really know what to think about the relation between IQ, immigration, etc.' The NLS panel data that Borjas studies all the time has an IQ proxy (AFQT) in there that is highly powerful in regressions, and he has to know this. He also knows that the subject is not good for one's career, so I understand why he has trained his mind to not think about it, but it's surely an

 Interestingly,

[Edward Miller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_M._Miller)

writes a lot about race and IQ, which is probably why he spent his career in an academic backwater. His seminal 1977 piece

[Risk, Uncertain and Difference of Opinion](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.1977.tb03317.x/abstract)

was really the first paper giving a theory as to why risk and return are inversely correlated, and was the first person to state in a journal one should invest in low beta/volatility stocks for this reason.

out there in a CFA magazine. I can copy, paste into a translator, and get a broken English translation that is good enough.
