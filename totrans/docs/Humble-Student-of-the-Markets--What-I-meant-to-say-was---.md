# Humble Student of the Markets: What I meant to say was...

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2021/06/what-i-meant-to-say-was.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2021/06/what-i-meant-to-say-was.html#0001-01-01)

After a number of discussions with readers, there appears to have been some misunderstanding over my recent post (see

[The bond market tempts FAIT](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2021/06/12/the-bond-market-tempts-fait/)

). I did not mean to imply that the advance in bond prices is an intermediate-term move, only a tactical counter-trend rally. The decline in Treasury yields can be attributable to:

*   The market's buy-in to the Fed's "transitory inflation" narrative, which was discussed extensively in the post;
*   Excessively short positioning by bond market investors, as shown by a JPMorgan Treasury client survey indicating that respondents were highly short duration, or price sensitivity to yield changes; and

*   A FOMO stampede by corporate defined-benefit pension plans. A recent study showed that pension plans were nearly fully funded from an actuarial viewpoint. Falling rates would raise the value of liabilities, and without asset-liability matching, pension plans were at risk of widening their funding gap.

In short,  the bond market rally is a tactical counter-trend rally. The combination of expansive fiscal and monetary policy will eventually put upward pressure on inflation and bond yields. 

That said, there are a number of pockets of uncorrelated opportunities for investors, regardless of how long Treasury yields stay down.
