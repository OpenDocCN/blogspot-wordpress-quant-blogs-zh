For active traders top-ranked Livermore Index stock Biogen (BIIB)  is creeping up to make a decisive breakout that could eventually reach recent  long-term resistance at around $70 if it is successful. It would appear that a $55.50-$56.50 price would be a target for purchase with an 8-10% stop leaving an attractive reward/risk setup. [http://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui](http://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui)
