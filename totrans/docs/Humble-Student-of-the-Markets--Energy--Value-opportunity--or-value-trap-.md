 recently highlighted an observation from BAML that the market cap of Apple (AAPL) is now larger than the entire energy sector.

AAPL is now the largest stock in the index, but its weight at 4.5% is not especially extreme in the context of the historical experience. The fact that AAPL's market cap has eclipsed the aggregate weight of the energy sector is telling.

Is this an inflection point for the energy sector? Do energy stocks represent a value opportunity that should be bought, or a value trap to be avoided?
