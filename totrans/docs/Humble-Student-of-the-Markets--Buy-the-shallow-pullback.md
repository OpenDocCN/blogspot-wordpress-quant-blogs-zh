**Mid-week market update:**

 After spending over two weeks in a narrow trading range, the SPX broke down out of that range yesterday and tested technical support at the 20 day moving average (dma), which was also the mid-

mark. At the height of the decline, the index had fallen 1% and the market was flashing short-term oversold signals.

It appeared that the market had successfully tested 20 dma support:

In addition, short-term breadth measures (via

) had retreated to oversold levels that a bounce was likely.

Those conclusions are based on the combination of an intermediate term backdrop of economic and fundamental growth and powerful price momentum. Under such circumstances, market pullbacks are likely to be shallow and further all-time highs would probably follow soon afterwards.
