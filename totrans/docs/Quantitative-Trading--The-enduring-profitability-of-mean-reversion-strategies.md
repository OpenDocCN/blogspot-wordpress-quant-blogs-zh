# Quantitative Trading: The enduring profitability of mean-reversion strategies

Some readers have doubts about my

[assertion](http://epchan.blogspot.com/2008/10/how-does-financial-crisis-affect.html)

that mean-reversal models continue to be very profitable during this whole year of financial and economic disasters. So I backtested the mean-reversion strategy in Example 3.8 of my

[book](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0470284889?tag=quantitativet-20&camp=14573&creative=327641&linkCode=as1&creativeASIN=0470284889&adid=0MX45PMCWGJXANAJGYDW&)

with the most recent one-year SP1500 data. Without transaction cost, the Sharpe ratio is 4.8\. Even after subtracting 10 b.p. round-trip transaction cost, it is still at 3.5.

Since the strategy was constructed over a year ago while I was writing the book, this most recent backtest is done on unseen data, with absolutely no look-ahead bias!
