# Humble Student of the Markets: The kid in the candy store

Top-down oriented investors seems to have significant concerns about the macroeconomic backdrop right now. On the other hand, many value and bottom-up oriented investors who were previously cautious on the market have either become more constructive on stocks or turned outright bullish. The list goes on:

Putting on my bottom-up investor’s hat on, I can sympathize with the bullish assessment. Just for fun I ran a quick screen of low-priced beaten up financials with heavy insider buying and came up with a moderately sized list, which is shown below. It’s easy to see how some of the bottom-up managers are behaving like kids in a candy store. You don't see these kinds of values every day. The P/Es of these financials are low and they have had significant insider buying in the last six months and no insider sales, which is an indication of management confidence. In addition, other deep value screens are also showing long lists of stocks with good upside potential with solid asset value support.

However, my inner top-down investor remains concerned that there is too much macro downside risk. The market is too dependent on
