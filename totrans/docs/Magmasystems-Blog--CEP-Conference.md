There is a good chance that I will be at the first

[Gartner Summit on Complex Event Processing](http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=502259&tab=overview)

in Orlando, September 19-21.

I am especially interesting to see what Coral8 has to say. My interests are in using CEP for Business Activity Monitoring and Algorithmic Trading.

Matt and Chris have had some good things to say about Coral8 in the past, and if I had some time to breathe, I would like to download their SDK and start mucking around.
