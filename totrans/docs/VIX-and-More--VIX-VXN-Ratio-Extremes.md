# VIX and More: VIX:VXN Ratio Extremes

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/08/vixvxn-ratio-extremes.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/08/vixvxn-ratio-extremes.html#0001-01-01)

Earlier this morning, Adam Warner at [Daily Options Report](http://adamsoptions.blogspot.com/2007/08/flight-to-quality-options.html) posted a [chart and commentary](http://adamsoptions.blogspot.com/2007/08/flight-to-quality-options.html) about the VIX:VXN ratio, which volatility groupies will recall compares the implied volatility of the S&P 500 to that of the NASDAQ 100.

The interesting factoid is that the VIX:VXN ratio is at an all-time high, which the chart below highlights (while the [VXN](http://www.cboe.com/micro/vxn/) was launched by the CBOE in early 2001, [StockCharts.com](http://stockcharts.com/charts/gallery.html?%24vxn) only has VXN data back to February 2003.)

The key question is why the VIX:VXN ratio is printing such extreme numbers at the present.  Adam concludes the following:

> *“Best guess is that there's a perception out there that tech is relatively *safe* now. And I suppose it is given that it's not the focus of the periodic poundage.”*

This take makes a lot of sense, as various ratios of technology stocks to financials (e.g., [XLK:XLF](http://stockcharts.com/charts/gallery.html?xlk:xlf) and [XCI:XBD](http://stockcharts.com/charts/gallery.html?%24xci:%24xbd)) reflect that the current environment is one of those rare instances where technology is considered less risky than financials.

A look at two SPDRs tells the story even better, in my opinion.  [XLF](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=xlf&hl=en), the financial sector SPDR ([XLF top holdings](http://finance.yahoo.com/q/hl?s=XLF)), shows a 160% spike in IV from mid-June, while [XLK](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=xlk&hl=en), the technology sector SPDR ([XLK top holdings](http://finance.yahoo.com/q/hl?s=XLK)), shows an IV spike of about 120%.  Even more interesting, at least to my eye, is that following the February 27^(th) VIX spike, XLK retraced all of its IV spike, while XLF only retraced half of that spike before starting to rise in mid-June.  Was the half-hearted XLF implied volatility spike retracement in March through June a warning of what was lurking under the surface?  For those who may be interested, of the nine [AMEX Select Sector SPDRs](http://www.sectorspdr.com/aboutspdrs/), four of the sectors –  financials, consumer discretionary ([XLY](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=xly&hl=en)), industrial ([XLI](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=xli&hl=en)), and utilities ([XLU](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=xlu&hl=en)) – did not retrace their February IV spike; and these sectors do *not* correlate with [relative sector performance](http://www.sectorspdr.com/sectortracker/) over the past month.
