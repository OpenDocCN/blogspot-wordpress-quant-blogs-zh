# Humble Student of the Markets: Which part of Goldman is right?

Many of you will have heard about

[Goldman's bullish call on oil](http://www.zerohedge.com/article/well-was-quick-goldman-goes-long-crude-raises-12-month-brent-forecast-130bbl)

(via ZeroHedge), with a target price of $130 for Brent. Not are they bullish on oil, but the entire commodity complex.

At the same time, Goldman is forecasting for

[an economic slowdown in China](http://ftalphaville.ft.com/blog/2011/05/24/576121/goldman-warns-of-significant-china-slowdown/)

:

> Our new GDP estimates show a significant slowdown in 2Q11 to 8.0% qoq (significantly below trend), then recovering towards trend in 3Q11 at 9.0% and returning to trend in 4Q11 at 9.3%. This is both a sharper and more extended slowdown than we had previously forecast.

How can Goldman Sachs be oil and commodity bullish when China consumes 25-50% of many key commodities?

[FT Alphaville](http://ftalphaville.ft.com/blog/2011/05/24/576131/and-now-goldman-says-the-commodities-correction-is-over/)

points out some analysis from Simon Hunt of Simon Hunt Strategic Services which suggests that rising copper demand seen in China is the result of re-stocking and not final demand, which remains weak:

> What is now being seen is that fabricators who have been operating on a hand to mouth basis, now seeing prices having fallen by $1000+ , are replenishing those inventories. It is not a signal that actual production of semis, i.e material going into furnaces has improved. On the contrary, I expect to be told that business is pretty weak.

Who is right? Which part of Goldman Sachs is right? Are they all right?

I don't know. This is a "feature" of sell-side research, where you have encounter analysts with competing views.
