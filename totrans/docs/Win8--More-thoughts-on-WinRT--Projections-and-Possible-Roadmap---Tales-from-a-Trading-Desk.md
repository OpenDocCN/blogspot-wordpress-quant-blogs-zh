## Win8: More thoughts on WinRT, Projections and Possible¬†Roadmap

Some thoughts from watching more BUILD video‚Äôs:

*   COM is king again in Microsoft ‚Äì although yes its an improved COM
*   Curious that for [Metro](http://www.scottlogic.co.uk/blog/colin/2011/09/windows-8-an-os-of-two-halves/) style applications the [WinRT](http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2011/Sep-15.html) has returned to native code. From a future roadmap, its clear from BUILD we have the 1-2 year WinRT view ‚Äì Metro style UI applications, but what‚Äôs the deal with server side programming? Aren‚Äôt there benefits (async et al) to offering WinRT in the server world as well?
*   Projections are key, and the magic of the WinRT from a high level language perspective
*   [IInspectable](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/br205821(v=vs.85).aspx) is the new IUnknown
*   With [WinRT](http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs/sasha/archive/2011/09/17/under-the-covers-of-winrt-using-c.aspx) fully owned by the Windows Dev team, lets hope Microsoft has internally moved on from the Developer Division vs Windows Division infighting
*   HTML or XAML ‚Äì you choose your markup. Isn‚Äôt XAML just tags for Windows UI controls? Will the future see just HTML in the Metrox vNext world?
*   Silverlight isn‚Äôt [dead](http://pendsevikram.blogspot.com/2011/09/silverlight-is-deadand-our-thought.html), it was clear a long time ago. Problem is messaging and panic
*   CLR Core Framework 4.5 has some nice [improvements](http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs/sasha/archive/2011/09/17/improvements-in-the-clr-core-in-net-framework-4-5.aspx).
*   Matt Merry‚Äôs talk is [excellent](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/BUILD/BUILD2011/PLAT-875T). Definitely a must watch. Explorer.exe calls RPCSS, which calls DOCMLaunch with calls wwahost.exe that start your Metro style application
*   Ian offer a good read on Real Native WinRT [Development](http://www.interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog/2011/09/16/real-native-winrt)
*   Curious to see if the sell-side (investment banks) consider deploying Win8 when its release presumable in 2012, given that they jumped from WinXP to Win7 only in the near 12 months or
*   Roslyn CTP will be release in mid October 2011
*   Metro style application in finance are curious. Not sure I‚Äôd have a tile per currency pair üôÇ
