About a month dated,

[Time Magazine's Person of the Year for 2007](http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/personoftheyear/article/0,28804,1690753_1690757_1690766,00.html)

was Russian President and soon-to-be Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin. Time says its designation is not meant to be anything honorary, but simply an acknowledgment of someone who had a profound affect on the year.

A follow-up story to Time's was released just days later by the UK's

Guardian

, in which was detailed an account of Putin's

[various financial interests](http://www.guardian.co.uk/russia/article/0,,2230924,00.html)

around the world, and the subsequent struggle to gain control of these assets.

There are some relevant similarities between the history and rise of Putin as compared to the recent article published by

[Portfolio.com](http://www.portfolio.com/)

. The article in question,

[Spy vs. Spy](http://www.portfolio.com/news-markets/international-news/portfolio/2007/12/17/Ex-Spies-Corporate-Work)

, is a detailed account of the latest tactics and strategies of corporate espionage. I cannot help but notice certain undertones between the business acumen of Putin and the corporate "information arbitrage" (borderline insider transactions) and the dealings of corporate spies.

What is it with

and pseudo-mafioso-capitalism?
