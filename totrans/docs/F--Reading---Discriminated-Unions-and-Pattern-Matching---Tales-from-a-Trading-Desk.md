## F# Reading – Discriminated Unions and Pattern Matching

Johann recent posting, [Asteroid Sharp Shooter: Post-mortem](http://sharp-gamedev.blogspot.com/2011/03/asteroid-sharpshooter-post-mortem.html), offers interesting reading in the F# XBox space. Johnann comments resonate with other F# postings around certain F# features aiding development:

> Features such as discriminated unions and pattern matching are lacking in C#

I echo similar views from the development Lab49 has done with F# around Single Dealer Platforms/Real-Time Market Risk.

Finally, The Path of [Go](http://www.gameranx.com/updates/id/1121/article/microsoft-research-team-releases-path-of-go-to-xbla/). Microsoft Research has this to say about F# usage:

> We used F# to program the AI. Because it abstracts [functionality](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/pathofgo/keyfacts.aspx) from coding, F# lets you focus more on the problem domain and less on programming itself.
