## Finally, CCS V2 beta is offically out

via VolkerW’s [blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/volkerw/archive/2007/11/14/beta-1-of-windows-hpc-server-2008-available.aspx). “Microsoft also created the Parallel Computing Initiative, which encompasses the vision, strategy and innovative developments in systems, runtimes, programming models, libraries, language extensions, and development tools across desktop and cluster” – lets hope we see GridLINQ for CCS soon.
