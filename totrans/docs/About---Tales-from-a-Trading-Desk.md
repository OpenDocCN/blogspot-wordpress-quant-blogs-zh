## About

I’ve worked in the financial vertical for 20+ years, building capital markets systems for most asset classes, using C++, Java, JavaScript and the Microsoft stack. I’ve worked in most of the top tier investment banks – last count was 25+ financial firms.

Since the early years of my career, I’ve been steered by the following, thanks in part to a number of colleagues during my first few contracting roles in London in the mid 90’s:

*   Stand tall, dress smart, act smart, be smart
*   Cut to the chase
*   Talk. Communicate
*   Change the Game. Make an impact in the first week
*   A plan is essential – and a backup plan
*   Keep moving forwards. If required tack like a boat, but keep the momentum – ROI/Deliver
*   Quality. Standards. [Checklists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Checklist_Manifesto). Get them in place ASAP. Iterate
*   Accept mistakes (Mistakes are how you learn), but catch them early!
*   Bad news doesn’t age well
*   Never take anything for granted. Double check. ([Trust, but verify](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust,_but_verify))
*   Always work as a team
*   Clean up the mess that you make
