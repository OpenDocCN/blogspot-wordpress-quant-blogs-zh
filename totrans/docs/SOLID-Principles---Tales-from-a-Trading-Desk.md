## SOLID Principles

> If you take the SOLID [principles](http://www.infoq.com/news/2014/03/oo-functional-programming) to their extremes, you arrive at something that makes Functional Programming look quite attractive
> 
> [SOLID](http://blog.ploeh.dk/2014/03/10/solid-the-next-step-is-functional/), particularly the SRP and ISP, leads you towards code bases with many fine-grained classes with a single method. Such objects represent data with behaviour, but can also be modelled as behaviour with data: Closures. When that happens repeatedly, it’s time to make the switch to a Functional Programming Language like F#.
