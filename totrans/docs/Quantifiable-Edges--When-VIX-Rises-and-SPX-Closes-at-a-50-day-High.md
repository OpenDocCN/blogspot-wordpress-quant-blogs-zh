# Quantifiable Edges: When VIX Rises and SPX Closes at a 50-day High

There were a few studies related to VIX action that appeared in the Quantifinder yesterday afternoon. This particular study looks at large mid-week rises in the VIX during times the SPX is closing at a 50-day high. All results are updated.

New readers may wonder why I use a day-of-week filter with this study. The VIX has a natural tendency to fall on Fridays and rise on Mondays. Because of this I typically separate out those days from the rest of the week when conducting VIX-based studies. Implications of the rising VIX and 50-day SPX high appear to be moderately bearish over the next few days, suggesting a pullback.
