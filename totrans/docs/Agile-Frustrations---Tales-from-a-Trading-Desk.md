## Agile Frustrations

Not Just Code Monkeys [presentation](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/healthy-social-environment) from Martin Fowler offers an interesting journey through his presentation.

[Conversation](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ConversationalStories.html) stories – programmers should be part of story development.  BA’s and UX’s shouldn’t be left to define the backlog without engineering conversation.

Domain knowledge for a developer is king.

Engineers need to take responsibility for the code

Mr Fowler really doesn’t like finance.
