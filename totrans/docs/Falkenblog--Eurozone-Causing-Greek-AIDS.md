# Falkenblog: Eurozone Causing Greek AIDS

> 来源：[http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2011/11/eurozone-causing-greek-aids.html#0001-01-01](http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2011/11/eurozone-causing-greek-aids.html#0001-01-01)

A Greek economist notes that some Greeks are intentionally infecting themselves with HIV to qualify for benefits, the result of the Greek austerity forced on it by those nasty surplus countries currently funding their deficits. He mentions this, he says, to make dry statistics more real, to convey the true picture of what is going on in Greece. I see this as another reason why anecdotes are usually tendentious crap.

Greece can either 1) leave the Euro and inflate their way out of their internal obligations, 2) stop running a deficit or 3) do what their lenders say to get their money. Who in their right mind would lend them money given their track record?
