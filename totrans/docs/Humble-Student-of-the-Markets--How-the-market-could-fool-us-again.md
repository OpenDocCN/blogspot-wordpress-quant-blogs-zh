# Humble Student of the Markets: How the market could fool us again

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2018/02/how-market-could-fool-us-again.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2018/02/how-market-could-fool-us-again.html#0001-01-01)

**Mid-week market update**

: I can tell that a stock market downdraft is a correction and not the start of a major bear market when the doomsters crawl out of the woodwork after the market has fallen (see

[Is the 'short volatility' blowup Bear Stearns or Lehman Brothers?](http://gainspainscapital.com/2018/02/12/short-volatility-blow-bear-stearns-lehman-brothers/)

) and analysis from SentimenTrader shows that their smart and dumb money sentiment indicators are at an extreme. As a frame of reference, SentimenTrader defines each term in the following way:

> The dumb money indicators are typically made up of retail traders and trend-followers. This is NOT to say that all (or even most) retail mom-and-pop investors, and certainly not most trend-followers, are "dumb". In fact, they are by definition correct during the bulk of a trend.
> 
> The smart money indicators are mostly made up of institutional accounts. These traders are often hedging day-to-day moves in the market, and therefore are often trading against the prevailing trend. Again, it is only when these traders move to an extreme that a market is most likely to reverse in their direction.

Sure, this could be the start of a bear market, but bear markets usually begin with technical deterioration, which are not present today.
