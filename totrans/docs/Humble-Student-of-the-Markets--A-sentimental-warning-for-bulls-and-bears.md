**Mid-week market update:**

Recently, there have been numerous data points indicating excessive bullishness from different segments of the market:

*   Retail investors are all-in
*   Institutional investor bullish sentiment is off the charts
*   Cash is at a two-decade low in global investor portfolios
*   RIA sentiment are at bullish extremes
*   Hedge funds are in a crowded long in equities

These giddy sentiment readings are comforting to the bear camp (chart via

) and it will be difficult for stock prices to advance under such conditions. When everyone is bullish, who is left to buy?
