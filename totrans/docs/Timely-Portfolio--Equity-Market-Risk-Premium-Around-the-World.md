Over the years I have really enjoyed this very thorough [IESE Business School](http://www.iese.edu/) survey of market risk premium around the world.

> **Market Risk Premium and Risk Free Rate Used for 51 Countries in 2013**

I thought a little d3/rCharts interactivity might really liven up the error bar plot.  This is far from perfect, but I like the direction in which it is headed.  Click [here](http://timelyportfolio.github.io/rCharts_errorbar/marketriskpremium/mktRiskPremium.html) or on the screenshot below to see it live.
