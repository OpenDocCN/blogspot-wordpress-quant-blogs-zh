## Catching up after¬†vacation

Returning from vacation is hard ‚Äì the context switch back to work mode is relatively easy, what I find hard is the early morning starts (5am). There is also the 1000‚Äôs of work emails to catch up on coupled with Google Reader items.

*   While I‚Äôve been out the office it appears the Windows 7 blog has come [alive](http://blogs.msdn.com/e7/archive/2008/08/18/windows_5F00_7_5F00_team.aspx). The latest posting on feature teams is worth a read if your into knowing how the Microsoft machine works.
*   HSBC appears to be [considering](http://www.finextra.com/community/fullblog.aspx?id=1678) moving from Blackberry to [iPhone](http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=00036T&topic_id=1&topic=Ask+E%2eT%2e), not surprising given that everyone appears to want an iPhone these days.
*   David Chappell has written a cloud [white paper](http://www.davidchappell.com/CloudPlatforms--Chappell.pdf) which is probably worth a ready ‚Äì although this [article](http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/?p=1536) is actually more interesting as it references Red Dog and Zurich.
*   With the Olympics in full swing there‚Äôs a number of posting around NBC‚Äôs Silverlight site: [here](http://geekswithblogs.net/yowhann/archive/2008/08/19/124538.aspx), [here](http://blogs.msdn.com/dachou/archive/2008/08/09/olympics-on-silverlight.aspx) [and](http://blogs.msdn.com/robinm/archive/2008/08/11/cool-site-nbcolympics-com.aspx) [here](http://timheuer.com/blog/archive/2008/08/13/nbc-olympics-behind-the-scenes.aspx).
*   August 2008 MSDN Magazine has a number of interesting articles:
*   Learning Parallel [Programming](http://www.pluralsight.com/community/blogs/drjoe/archive/2008/08/18/learning-parallel-programming-from-shared-memory-multi-threading-to-distributed-memory-multi-processing.aspx).
*   [CUDA U](http://www.hpcwire.com/industry/academia/CUDA_U_Is_Now_in_Session.html)
*   NVIDIA Shows Interactive Ray Tracing on [GPUs](http://www.hothardware.com/News/NVIDIA-Shows-Interactive-Ray-Tracing-on-GPUs/) ‚Äì real-time ray tracing with adequate performance for fluid motion is the future.
*   Still no sign of a killer financial Microsoft Surface [application](http://blogs.msdn.com/mspowerutilities/archive/2008/08/13/surfacing-new-applications-with-microsoft-surface.aspx) üò¶
*   .NET Framework 3.5 [SP1](http://blogs.msdn.com/brada/archive/2008/08/18/what-changed-in-net-framework-3-5-sp1.aspx) [got](http://blogs.msdn.com/hlsdpe/archive/2008/08/14/go-get-it-visual-studio-2008-net-framework-3-5-sp1-and-the-training-kit.aspx) [released](http://blogs.msdn.com/nijain/archive/2008/08/16/visual-studio-2008-sp1-and-net-framework-3-5-sp1.aspx). Unfortunately the [WPF](http://www.wpfstyles.com/) [DataGrid](http://blogs.msdn.com/vinsibal/archive/2008/08/14/wpf-datagrid-dissecting-the-visual-layout.aspx) didn‚Äôt make it into the release, but at least it made it to [codeplex](http://blogs.msdn.com/llobo/archive/2008/08/13/wpf-datagrid-ctp.aspx). If your moving into WPF, you might find this [book](http://www.amazon.com/GUI-Bloopers-2-0-Interactive-Technologies/dp/0123706432) interesting.
*   Visual Studio IronPython Integration [Deep Dive](http://ironpython-urls.blogspot.com/2008/07/visual-studio-ironpython-integration.html)
*   Glenn Block on [Prism, Unity, and MEF](http://blogs.msdn.com/gblock/archive/2008/08/19/prism-mef-and-di-oh-my.aspx)
*   Coding the Market thinks [Caplin](http://etrading.wordpress.com/2008/07/08/building-with-caplin/) in the answer to SDP. Maybe Mostly should consider Caplin for an [OMS](http://mostly.wordpress.com/2008/07/17/the-future-of-oms/)?
*   Sounds like Microsoft needs to add a lot more [servers](http://insidehpc.com/2008/08/18/microsofts-cloud-a-little-thin/) to its cloud.
*   New Gigaspaces [MonteCarlo](http://blog.gigaspaces.com/2008/08/12/video-is-worth-a-million-words-latest-gigaspacesxap-demo/) application.
