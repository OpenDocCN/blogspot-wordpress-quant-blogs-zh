## Zoe Food Health App Experience

About 2 weeks ago I received my [Zoe](https://zoe.com/) test kit.

The yellow box that was delivered by the Royal Mail was overkill in my view. An expense that after a number of days, felt like Zeo had concentrated on the wrong parts of the overall Customer User Experience.

First, let me summaries the positives from my experience:

*   On-line chat support was helpful
*   Libre app and sensor for collecting blood glucose readings is easy to use, and the biggest value add in experimenting with food
*   Blood collection is relatively pain free

The unfortunate negatives:

*   If anything goes wrong on the order of your tasks day to day in the Zoe App, Zoe support can’t do a lot to correct the order, impacting the overall User Experience within the app, and causing frustration
*   Using two apps, Zoe and Libre was just wrong from a User Experience
*   When filling in questionnaires in the app, there appears to be no way to pause, and resume. Just discard and start again – challenging
*   There is some duplication on data entry across the initial week of questionnaires
*   The email “blood sugar challenge plan” is sent from the domain typeform.com
*   There is very limited feedback and insight in the first few weeks, which comes back again to overall poor User Experience

In summary, it was an interesting experience. For anyone who has already spent time reading about nutrition, you maybe best to start with Libre app and then consider if Zoe is worth the $
