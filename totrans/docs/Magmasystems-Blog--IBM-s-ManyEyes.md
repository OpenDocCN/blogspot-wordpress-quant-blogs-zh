(Thanks to Jules)

[ManyEyes](http://services.alphaworks.ibm.com/manyeyes/home)

is a community-based visualization project from IBM, run by the guy who did the Stock Market heatmaps for Smart Money.

You can upload your own datasets and apply some pre-made visualizations to it. People in the community have contributed other visualizations.

Pretty cool.
