# VIX and More: Selloff Overdone Prior to FOMC Minutes Release?

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/01/selloff-overdone-prior-to-fomc-minutes.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/01/selloff-overdone-prior-to-fomc-minutes.html#0001-01-01)

In the hour and 40 or minutes or so before the FOMC releases the [minutes from their December meeting](http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm), I am using the market weakness to make some buys.  I have a number of reasons for doing this, not all of which I am going to detail here.  Instead, I will post a chart of the NASDAQ TRIN, the counterpart to the [NYSE TRIN](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/12/bullish-trin-as-year-winds-down.html) that I discussed a couple of days ago.  TRIN numbers can be calculated for each exchange.  I watch the NASDAQ closely because the NASDAQ often leads the NYSE in terms of determining speculative sentiment.

In the chart below, I use 5 minute bars over a 10 day range.  My thinking, in a nutshell, is not that I can guess what the FOMC minutes will reveal, nor even how the market will react to it, but I suspect that *if* the news is considered bullish by traders, the market will move much more decisively than if the news is considered to be bearish.

I consider this a contrarian sentiment play, with an asymmetrical news reaction magnitude potential.  From a probability perspective, it’s about a 50% play; from an [expectation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value) perspective, I think the numbers are solidly in my favor.
