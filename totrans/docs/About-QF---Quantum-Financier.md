# About QF – Quantum Financier

> 来源：[https://quantumfinancier.wordpress.com/about/#0001-01-01](https://quantumfinancier.wordpress.com/about/#0001-01-01)

The Quantum Financier blog is a repository for my thoughts and research on the markets.

*About Me*

Canadian expat currently running a trading desk and research for a proprietary trading firm in Chicago. I welcome the opportunity to share with other empirically minded bloggers and readers to improve my understanding of the market.

> Quantum: minimum unit of any physical entity involved in an interaction.
> 
> Financier: person who handles money, typically a powerful person.

There it is, the title says it all; I am only a small player in a big game but look forward to this blog and the discussions I hope to have with readers.
