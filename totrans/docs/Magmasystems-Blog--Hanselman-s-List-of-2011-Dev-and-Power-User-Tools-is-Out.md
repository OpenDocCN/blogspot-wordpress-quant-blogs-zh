# Magmasystems Blog: Hanselman's List of 2011 Dev and Power User Tools is Out

> 来源：[http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2011/12/hanselmans-list-of-2011-dev-and-power.html#0001-01-01](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2011/12/hanselmans-list-of-2011-dev-and-power.html#0001-01-01)

One of my favorite recurring blog posts can be found

[here](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ScottHanselmans2011UltimateDeveloperAndPowerUsersToolListForWindows.aspx)

.

Don't forget to read all of the user comments, as they often refer to great tools that Hanselman has skipped over.

Unless you have admin access at work, you will most likely need to lobby your Chief Architect to get some of these tools approved. Or, if you have a TechArch committee, be prepared to abandon all hope.
