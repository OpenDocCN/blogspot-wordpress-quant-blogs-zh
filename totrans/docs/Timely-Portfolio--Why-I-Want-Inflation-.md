# Timely Portfolio: Why I Want Inflation?

> 来源：[http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2011/02/why-i-want-inflation.html#0001-01-01](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2011/02/why-i-want-inflation.html#0001-01-01)

Bernanke wants inflation for his reasons.  I want inflation for entirely different reasons even though it might be painful.

> Inflation forces the world to rectify its imbalances.  Emerging Asia no longer will believe a 20-100% undervalued currency is good monetary policy.

> Inflation forces leverage reduction.  Inflation increases interest rates and ends the infinite supply of money to overleveraged governments.  As a consumer, more debt means a lower credit rating which means a higher rate.  Higher rates are the built-in control mechanism to reckless borrowing behavior.
> 
> Inflation favors risk-taking.  Deflation favors risk-avoidance.  Risk-taking helps cure the tremendous misallocation of resources to “risk-less” bonds and gold in pursuit of real opportunity.
> 
> Inflation helps reduce dependence on limited scarce resources.  Higher prices on commodities make innovative renewable techniques attractive.

Unfortunately, “financial innovation” disrupted the higher prices that started in 2007-2008, so the world is 3 years behind.
