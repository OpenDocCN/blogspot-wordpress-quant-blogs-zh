# Humble Student of the Markets: Buy the breadth thrust and FOMO stampede?

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2020/06/buy-breadth-thrust-and-fomo-stampede.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2020/06/buy-breadth-thrust-and-fomo-stampede.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models**

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post,

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The

**Trend Asset Allocation Model**

is an asset allocation model which applies trend following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or contraction (bearish)?"

My inner trader uses a

**trading model**

, which is a blend of price momentum (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa). Subscribers receive real-time alerts of model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of the those email alerts are updated weekly

. The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that began in March 2016 is shown below.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Sell equities*
*   Trend Model signal: Neutral*
*   Trading model: Neutral*

**Breadth thrusts are bullish**

Last week, technical analyst

[Walter Deemer](https://twitter.com/WalterDeemer/status/1268278703395659784)

pointed out that the market had flashed a "breakaway momentum" buy signal. He did qualify the condition, "Supposed to get it near the beginning of a powerful move, not after a 42% advance (altho did have late signals Jul 12 2016 and Nov 20 1950). Definitely not its finest moment..."

As well, Deemer reported on Friday that the market achieved both a Whaley Breadth Thrust and a Whaley Volume Thrust.

Could this be the start of a new bull leg? On one hand, the market's animal spirits are stirring, and breadth thrusts like Deemer's breakaway momentum signal have historically been bullish. There are usually signals of a full-fledged Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) stampede, especially in light of the surprisingly strong May Jobs Report (see

[May Jobs Report: Back from furlough](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2020/06/05/may-jobs-report-back-from-furlough/)

). If you only believe technical analysis is all that matters, then you should be bullish.

On the other hand, the market is trading at a stratospheric forward P/E of 22.4, and at a 2021 P/E of 19.5\. To buy now means adopting the late 1990's go-go mentality that earnings don't matter, and all that matters is price momentum.

Careers were made and severely damaged during the dot-com era. Should traders throw caution to the wind?
