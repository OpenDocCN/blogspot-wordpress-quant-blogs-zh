Supposed to be a beautiful day on Saturday. Taking the Cessena 172 up to Burlington, Vermont. I think it's too late in the year to experience the full Vermont foliage from the air, but nevertheless, a beautfil flight up the Hudson! Coming back at night, so I get to put in some required nighttime flying hours.
