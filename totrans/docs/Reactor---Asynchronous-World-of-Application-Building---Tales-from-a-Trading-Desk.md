## Reactor – Asynchronous World of Application Building

It’s nice to see Reactor hitting the second M1 [milestone](http://spring.io/blog/2013/08/27/reactor-1-0-0-m2-a-foundation-for-reactive-fast-data-applications-on-the-jvm).  Having coded Rx on .NET, coupled with a lot of work recently with RxJava, it appears time to have a [detailed](http://jaxenter.com/springsource-s-asynchronous-jvm-framework-reactor-hits-first-milestone-47786.html) look at [Reactor](https://github.com/reactor/reactor).  It’s always nice to see a trading bias to the [samples](http://spring.io/blog/2013/07/18/reactor-1-0-0-m1-a-foundation-for-asynchronous-fast-data-applications-on-the-jvm/) of [reactive](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jPJh1VFNpk&list=PLnCSV-Zt6sWWcKPoth3QeXhhcPcbJmrM8) frameworks 🙂
