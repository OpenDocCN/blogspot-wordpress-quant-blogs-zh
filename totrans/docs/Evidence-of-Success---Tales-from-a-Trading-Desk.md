# Evidence of Success | Tales from a Trading Desk

## Evidence of Success

A few thoughts if you are about to venture down the road of building a software applications:

*   How will you know when you are [DONE](https://manifesto.co.uk/definition-done/) on implementing the requirements (Stories)?
*   How will you validate to the product owner that you are DONE?  Maybe consider traceability and linkage of stories to acceptance criteria to acceptance tests?
*   Ticking a box to say you have implemented all the requirements is in many ways immediate stale as soon as the code is “enhanced” post the box ticking exercise.
*   When in production, how will you know if the application is “broken”?  Considering solutions for logging, monitoring, availability etc
*   Logging is only as good as the data logged 🙂  Over use of logging will mean there is the wrong noise to signal ratio 🙂  Likewise to monitoring
*   If the application is “highly available”, prove it, in production 🙂

You could think of this as Test Driven Developer->Behaviour Driven Developer->Evidence Driven Developer, or even Evidence Driven Engineering
