In my previous post

[China the next shoe or the final capitulation?](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2008/11/china-next-shoe-or-final-capitulation.html)

I referenced a link to analysis from stocktiming.com:

> Stocktiming.com refreshes its analysis on a weekly basis and therefore the link to the Chinese market analysis will be overwritten on Monday November 24, 2008.

Stocktiming.com has kindly supplied me with a

[new link](http://www.stocktiming.com/shanghai_stock_market/Shanghai_Index_Effect_Nov.htm)

which doesn't expire next week. The link in my previous post has been corrected.
