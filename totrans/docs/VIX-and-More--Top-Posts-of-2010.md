# VIX and More: Top Posts of 2010

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/12/top-posts-of-2010.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/12/top-posts-of-2010.html#0001-01-01)

It is hard to believe that I have been blogging for four years. Initially I just thought I’d take a couple of minutes during the slow period of the trading day to capture a thought or two for archival purposes, but that original intent has continued to morph into something far beyond what I imagined.

These days most of what I post is for the benefit of readers rather than to aid my personal recollection, but I like to keep things eclectic, provocative and visually interesting for the benefit of all.

The end of the year is a great time to reflect on what readers have found to be of interest at *VIX and More*. Each year new themes seem to emerge among the top 25 most read posts in this space. This year the dominant themes seem to incorporate the [VIX-based ETNs](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20ETN) (specifically [VXX)](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX), [contango,](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/contango) the [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures) [term structure](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/term%20structure) and [put to call ratios](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/put%20to%20call). The #1 post of the year, [The Education of a Trader](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/09/education-of-trader.html), is one of the few times I have talked about my own trading, but I imagine it is the universality of the message that struck a chord with most readers.

Thanks to all who have contributed in one way or another to the content here. I like to say that not every day shows a profit, but every day should make you smarter, which will help the bottom line in the days and weeks ahead.

Finally, I have tagged a select group of posts (including six from 2010) as worthy of a somewhat arbitrary “

” designation. These are all posts in which, regardless of popularity, I believe the content reflects some of the best efforts on this site.
