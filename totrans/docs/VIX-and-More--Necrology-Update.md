![](img/6eaddaa994e25d7df65e164919c69961.png)Last week it was [Rostropovich](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mstislav_Rostropovich); this week it’s [Kevin’s Market Blog](http://kevinsmarketblog.blogspot.com/).  It’s tough when your favorites pass on.  Fortunately, in Kevin’s case he’s still with us; he’s just moving on to better things in the non-blog world.

The good news is that each departed friend in my blogroll creates room for a new one in my [self-imposed limit of 32 blogs](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/04/bloglines-and-information-waterworks.html).  As such, I’d like to formally welcome the most recent additions to the VIX and More blogroll:

*   [Toro’s Running of the Bulls](http://runningofthebulls.typepad.com/) – pointed commentary, superb graphics, and a wide-ranging list of targets

*   [CXO Advisory Group](http://www.cxoadvisory.com/blog/) – thought-provoking stock market research you won’t find anywhere else

*   [Infectious Greed](http://paul.kedrosky.com/) – Paul Kedrosky’s perspectives on investments, the VC world, and everything in between

*   [Yaser Anwar](http://www.yaseranwar.com/) – like Kevin, Yaser manages to strike the perfect balance between the a fundamental, technical and informational perspective on investing
