## Apache Kafka – Multi Asset Class Usage

InfoQ has an old, but relevant article on [Kafka](http://www.infoq.com/articles/apache-kafka) usage in financial services – specifically S&P Capital IQ.  Interesting comparisons to RabbitMQ and ActiveMQ.  “Real-Time Stream Processing as Game Changer in a Big Data World with Hadoop and Data Warehouse” is also worth a [read](http://www.infoq.com/articles/stream-processing-hadoop).
