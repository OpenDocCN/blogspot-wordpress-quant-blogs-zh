A note from Scalia's new book

[Making Your Case](http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/making_your_case)

, on how to argue before a court:

> A noted barrister, F.E. Smith, had argued at some length in an English court when the judge leaned over the bench and said: “I have read your case, Mr. Smith, and I am no wiser than I was when I started.”
> 
> To which the barrister replied: “Possibly not, My Lord, but far better informed.”

heh.
