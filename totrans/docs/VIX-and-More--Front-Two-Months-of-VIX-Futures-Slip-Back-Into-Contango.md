# VIX and More: Front Two Months of VIX Futures Slip Back Into Contango

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2011/09/front-two-months-of-vix-futures-slip.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2011/09/front-two-months-of-vix-futures-slip.html#0001-01-01)

For the first time since the end of July the front two months of the VIX [futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures) are in [contango](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/contango), after spending 1 1/2 months in [backwardation](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/backwardation).

While the degree of contango is very slight at the moment, this means that the short-term inverse [VIX futures ETPs](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20ETN) (e.g., [XIV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XIV)) are now benefiting from negative roll yield, while the short-term long VIX futures ETPs ([VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX), [TVIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TVIX), etc.) are no longer receiving the benefit of positive roll yield from backwardation and now face a slight headwind.
