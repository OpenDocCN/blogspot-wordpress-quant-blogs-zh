## Dublin, Cloud and¬†More

As we close in on the PDC Microsoft takes it‚Äôs normal stance of pre-releasing tip bits of information about PDC announcements. Appears we maybe in for a treat with [Dublin](http://blogs.msdn.com/allandcp/archive/2008/10/02/hello-dublin-more-on-net-framework-4-0.aspx), [.NET 4.0](http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/?p=1614), [Oslo](http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Application-Development/Visual-Basic-Guru-Moves-to-Microsofts-Oslo-Team/?kc=rss), and [Windows Cloud](http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&articleId=9115978&source=rss_news). I suspect we can expect the [Silverlight](http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&articleId=9115998&source=rss_topic125) RTM to account sometime in the PDC timeframe as well, although I hope they release details and a short timeframe for Silverlight vNext as Adobe is still ahead of the game in terms of controls.

Amazon with their early cloud initiative and recent Windows [support](http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/?p=1615) is ahead of Microsoft in cloudland, but as normal we can only expect interesting things from Microsoft, the only downside is the timescales üò¶ Lets hope the [Zurich](http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/?p=1503) rumours are validated at the PDC.

Parallelism is also going to be one of the central themes at the [PDC](http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/?p=1612), with this months MSDN [Magazine](http://www.bluebytesoftware.com/blog/PermaLink,guid,fe25f51a-c8b4-4839-99cc-1537a436d42f.aspx) prep‚Äôing the way.
