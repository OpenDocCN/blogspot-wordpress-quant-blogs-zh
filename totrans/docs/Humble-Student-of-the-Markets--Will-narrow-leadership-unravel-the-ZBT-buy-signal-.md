# Humble Student of the Markets: Will narrow leadership unravel the ZBT buy signal?

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2023/11/will-narrow-leadership-unravel-zbt-buy.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2023/11/will-narrow-leadership-unravel-zbt-buy.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models** 

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post, 

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The 

**Trend Asset Allocation Model**

 is an asset allocation model that applies trend-following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity prices. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. The performance and full details of a model portfolio based on the out-of-sample signals of the Trend Model can be found

[here](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/trend-model-report-card/)

.

My inner trader uses a 

**trading model**

, which is a blend of price momentum (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa). Subscribers receive real-time alerts of model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of the email alerts is updated weekly

. The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that began in March 2016 is shown below.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Buy equities (Last changed from “sell” on 28-Jul-2023)*
*   Trend Model signal: Bullish (Last changed from “neutral” on 28-Jul-2023)*
*   Trading model: Bullish (Last changed from “neutral” on 27-Oct-2023)*

** The performance chart and model readings have been delayed by a week out of respect to our paying subscribers.***Update schedule**

: I generally update model readings on my

 on weekends. I am also on X/Twitter at @humblestudent. Subscribers receive real-time alerts of trading model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of those email alerts is shown

####  A narrow advance

The recent Zweig Breadth Thrust signal should have been unconditionally bullish. This is a rare signal that has only been generated eight times since Marty Zweig first wrote about it in 1986\. The stock market has been up 6 and 12 months later after every single signal. In some cases, stocks continue to rise like a runaway freight train. In three instances, which include the buy signal generated in late March, the market rose but pulled back several months later to re-test the buy signal level.

What category will the latest buy signal fall in?

One short-term blemish to the latest buy signal is the problem of narrow leadership. Breadth, as measured by the ratio of S&P 500 to equal-weighted S&P 500 and net new highs, has been abysmal in the latest post-buy signal advance. Leadership has been mainly concentrated in the megacap growth stocks and small and mid-caps haven’t participated in market strength in the same way.

Will narrow leadership and bad breadth sink the latest ZBT buy signal?
