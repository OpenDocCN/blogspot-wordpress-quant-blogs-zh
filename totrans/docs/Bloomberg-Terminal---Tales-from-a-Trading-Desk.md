> 来源：[https://mdavey.wordpress.com/2014/04/15/bloomberg-terminal/#0001-01-01](https://mdavey.wordpress.com/2014/04/15/bloomberg-terminal/#0001-01-01)

## Bloomberg Terminal

Although a bit last month, Matt Turck offers an interesting [read](http://mattturck.com/2014/03/19/can-the-bloomberg-terminal-be-toppled/) on the Bloomberg Terminal.  A number of software packages are called out throughout the article, coupled with this possible key quote:

> A data producer like [[PsychSignal](https://psychsignal.com)] publishes its social media sentiment index on [[Quandl](http://www.quandl.com)]. A user exports that data from Quandl to a high-end visualization service like [[Plotly](https://plot.ly)] or [[DataHero](https://datahero.com)]; extracts subtle insights using an analytics tool like [[BigML](https://bigml.com/)]; backtests an investment strategy using [[Quantopian](https://www.quantopian.com)], and then actually trades on that data using Quantopian again.

Interesting items mentioned:

*   [Factset](http://www.factset.com/)
*   [SumZero](https://sumzero.com/) – Buy side hedge fund community
*   [Quantopian](https://www.quantopian.com/) – Platform to allow quants share strategies and algos
*   [ThinkNum](http://www.thinknum.com/) – Collaborate on investment research with users from around the world.
*   [Estimize](http://estimize.com/)
*   [Premise](http://www.premise.com/)
*   [Quandl](http://www.quandl.com/) – financial search engine
*   [Dataminr](http://www.dataminr.com/)
*   [Kensho](http://www.kensho.com/)
*   [Domino](http://www.dominoup.com/) – Easily run R, Python, and Matlab code in the cloud.  Automatic version control and collaboration for data, code, and results.
