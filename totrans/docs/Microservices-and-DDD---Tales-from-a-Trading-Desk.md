## Microservices and DDD

Coupled of interesting presentations on InfoQ that are worth watching around the hype of microservices:

*   The Seven Deadly [Sins](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/7-sins-microservices) of Microservices – some great comments in this presentation around the shiny stuff, with some good references to monolithic applications as well.  Boring technology reduces risk, and in many ways are the ideal tool.
*   Enabling Microservices with [Domain](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/ddd-microservices) Driven Design and Ports & Adapters – often not talked about enough, Domain Drive Design is nicely discussed in the context of microservices.
