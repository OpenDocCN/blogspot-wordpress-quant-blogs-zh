# VIX and More: Guest Columnist at The Striking Price for Barron’s: How to Spot Risk Early

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2013/07/guest-columnist-at-striking-price-for.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2013/07/guest-columnist-at-striking-price-for.html#0001-01-01)

Today’s guest column, [How to Spot Risk Early](http://online.barrons.com/article/SB50001424052748704093404578609670858329206.html), at *The Striking Price* on behalf of Steven Sears at [Barron’s](http://online.barrons.com/), is the eleventh time I have had the opportunity to write a column for Barron’s. Today’s column picks up on a theme I addressed in a March 2011 article in *Expiring Monthly* which was titled, Evaluating Volatility Across Asset Classes. In that 2011 article, I introduce the concept of a volatility compass as a framework for evaluating the different types of volatility spikes that were seen in the [2008](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/2008) financial crisis, the [euro zone crisis](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/European%20sovereign%20debt%20crisis) as of May 2010, the [Arab Spring](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Arab%20Spring) in March 2011, and the May 6, 2010 [flash crash](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/flash%20crash).

In the 2011 article I provide an overview of my thinking as follows:

> *“It is my belief that a better understanding of the volatility picture across asset classes will yield a better grasp of volatility events and help to identify a number of favorable trading setups.”*

Later on I conclude the article with the following thoughts:

> *“For those who have studied sector rotation strategies and methods for trading geography-based ETFs, some of the analytical techniques used in those two disciplines can be carried over to an analysis of cross asset class volatility.*
> 
>  **Ultimately, the study of volatility has both a science and art component to it, but a cross asset class approach provides a more broad-based holistic view of the volatility landscape and adds a little more science to the mix.*
> 
> *At some point, volatility becomes the study largely of contagion and falling dominoes. I can say without hesitation that a multi-disciplinary approach is essential to understanding contagion and dominoes and that a cross asset class analytical framework supplemented by tools such as the volatility compass is an effective way to approach that subject.”**

 *In today’s Barron’s article, I expand upon the idea of four types of volatility indices and address volatility indices that provide a snapshot of geographical uncertainty and [risk](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/risk) as well as broader measures of uncertainty and risk across asset classes such as U.S. Treasury Notes and currencies.

I will have more on this subject in the future, but for those interested in researching some of these subjects, I have highlighted some previous posts on different ways of thinking about uncertainty, risk and volatility below.
