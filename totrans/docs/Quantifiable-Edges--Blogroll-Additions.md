# Quantifiable Edges: Blogroll Additions

> 来源：[http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2008/11/blogroll-additions.html#0001-01-01](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2008/11/blogroll-additions.html#0001-01-01)

Some long overdue additions to the blogroll were done today:

[Market Rewind](http://marketrewind.blogspot.com/)

– Jeff Pietsch does an excellent job of posting running market commentary, links, and trading thoughts. I especially enjoyed his “

[Studies, Systems, & Methods Vault](http://marketrewind.blogspot.com/2008/11/studies-systems-methods.html)

” which was posted on Saturday.

[Blog For Trading Success](http://tradingsuccess.com/blog/)

– Ray Barros is a trading instructor and his blog is full of tips and trading techniques as well as market analysis.

[Condor Options](http://www.condoroptions.com/)

– Plenty of insightful information on options strategies.

[Masteroftheuniverse’s Weblog](http://masteroftheuniverse.wordpress.com/)

– A combination of trading commentary and anecdotes. Good news for those who enjoy his writing - it looks like he has a book coming out, too.

More to come...but not today.
