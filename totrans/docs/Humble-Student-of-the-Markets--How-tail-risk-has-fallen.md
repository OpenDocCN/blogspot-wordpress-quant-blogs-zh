# Humble Student of the Markets: How tail-risk has fallen

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2013/02/how-tail-risk-has-fallen.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2013/02/how-tail-risk-has-fallen.html#0001-01-01)

There is no doubt that tail-risk, or the risk of a catastrophic meltdown of the financial system, has fallen dramatically in the last couple of years. Consider that two years ago, Europe was mired in one summit after another over the eurozone financial crisis. In 2013, EU ministers are holding a crisis summit meeting over *gasp* horse meat (via

[The Telegraph](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/foodanddrinknews/9864222/European-ministers-to-hold-summit-over-horse-meat-scandal.html)

):

> The summit comes as supermarkets in Britain were urged by the Food Standards Agency to test pork, chicken and other meats for cross-contamination.
> 
> Meanwhile, Tesco has admitted that it had been selling frozen spaghetti bolognese ready meals which were between 60% and 100% horse meat.
> 
> Tomorrow's meeting has been called by Ireland, which holds the EU presidency, and where the scandal began after horse meat was discovered in frozen beef burgers.
> 
> The country's agriculture minister Simon Coveney said the summit was being held to discuss "whatever steps may be necessary at EU level to comprehensively address this matter".
> 
> Measures on the agenda will reportedly include labelling processed meat for its origin. Meanwhile processed meat manufacturers in Ireland have been asked to carry out DNA testing in a bid to reassure consumers and export markets.

How times have changed.
