The Trading Elite is a new site that features interviews with professional traders.  The site is run by Jared Mast.

I was honored to be one of the first traders interviewed by Jared.  The interview took place a few months ago, but it was posted when the site came on line in the last few weeks.  You may check it out at

There are also interviews with other traders whom I greatly respect, including Scott Andrews, Ray Barros, Dave Landry, and more.  So check out The Trading Elite. I have also added it to my blogroll.
