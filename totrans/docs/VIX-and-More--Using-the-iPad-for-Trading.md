# VIX and More: Using the iPad for Trading

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2011/03/using-ipad-for-trading.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2011/03/using-ipad-for-trading.html#0001-01-01)

Unless FedEx ([FDX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/FDX)) and Apple ([AAPL](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/AAPL)) have their facts wrong, today the [iPad](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/iPad) 2 will arrive at my door step.

Since I passed on the iPad 1, this will be my first chance to play with something that I have no idea what I will ultimately end up interacting with. This could turn out to be new computer in a different form factor a toy or anything in between.

While I will try to integrate the iPad into my trading, I am not sure how this is going to happen either. I am not a big fan of using my [iPhone](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/iPhone) for trading unless my environment does not allow any alternatives. As for the iPad, I can imagine it as a complement to my main trading setup, an excellent portable alternative to the iPhone and perhaps filling a bunch of other roles that I am not able to anticipate.

I would love hearing from other traders about how they use the iPad in their trading, whether it means news, charts, quotes, trade execution or whatever. If I get enough responses of note – either here or on Twitter ([http://www.twitter.com/VIXandMore](http://www.twitter.com/VIXandMore)) – I will summarize the information in a future post and add in my own experiences as well.
