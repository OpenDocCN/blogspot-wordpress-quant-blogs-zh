# Magmasystems Blog: I Got a Tech Writer !!!

Read it and weep, people ....

I got myself a real live technical writer for a few months. She has even done Visual Studio and MSDN documentation for Microsoft.

In all of the major projects that I have done for IBs, I have never seen the budget for a tech writer. We usually have to do it ourselves, after we are totally exhausted from delivering the technical aspect of a project. We might be lucky to get a BA to do some of the functional docs, but they will never dive into code.

This young lady who I now own actually installed Visual Studio on her laptop, and started stepping through the code!
