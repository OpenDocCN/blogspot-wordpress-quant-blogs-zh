# Quantifiable Edges: The low VIX:VXV ratio with the SPX at a new high

Examining the VIX:VXV ratio is a concept I first heard from Bill Luby at

[VIX & More](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/)

.  The VIX is a measure of short-term (30-day) volatility expectation and the VXV measures intermediate-term (93 day) volatility expectations.  The ratio right now is quite low - a little below 0.85.  This means that short-term volatility expectations are substantially below intermediate-term volatility expectations.  When readings this low coincide with 50-day SPX highs it suggests a possible bearish edge for the next day.  This was demonstrated in a study that
