# Reality Intrudes | Quantivity

> 来源：[https://quantivity.wordpress.com/2009/09/13/reality-intrudes/#0001-01-01](https://quantivity.wordpress.com/2009/09/13/reality-intrudes/#0001-01-01)

One of the great fantasies of [financial economics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_economics) is the [Efficient Market Hypothesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis), originated posited by [Bachelier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Bachelier) and popularized by [Fama](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Fama). Although this may be true in some very limited *asymptotic* statistical sense (which arguably is what Bachelier, but not Fama, intended), it certainly is not true from the perspective of any individual trader—or even, the [bulge bracket](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulge_bracket), it now appears. What is particularly interesting for traders is understanding *why this hypothesis is not correct*, as the underlying factors evolve over time (with commensurate opportunity for profit, as proved nicely by Swenson and Birnbaum with ABX).

Along this line, [The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com) has run two excellent pieces (for the popular press) acknowledging the various ways reality intrudes into the beautiful formal worlds of both quantitative finance and macroeconomics.

Today, [Wall Street’s Math Wizards Forgot a Few Variables](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/13/business/13unboxed.html) covers the role of [behavioral finance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_economics) from several idiosyncratic angles, including [liquidity risk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidity_risk) and online social networking. The latter is a particularly interesting angle for exploration. Favorite quote from the article:

> In the aftermath of the economic crisis, financial engineers, experts say, will probably shift more to risk management and econometric analysis and concentrate less on devising exotic new instruments.

From a different (yet complementary) angle, Krugman published an excellent survey article, [How Did Economists Get It So Wrong?](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/06/magazine/06Economic-t.html). The generations of economics students who found little practical use in classic macro theory undoubtedly quietly cheered a bit inside while reading this article. Ultimately, his argument boils down to the following, triangulating with the previous article:

> Economics profession went astray because economists, as a group, mistook beauty, clad in impressive-looking mathematics, for truth.

For anyone who spent time in academic economics, this should ring crystal clear.

What distinguishes both articles is their recognition that the *improper use* of mathematics is the problem, rather than trying to blame mathematics itself or its use (as was done in previous crises). Maybe we all have learned something from the 2008 crisis, after all.

[Note: hardcore quant analysis (including [regime dashboard](https://quantivity.wordpress.com/2009/08/23/market-regime-dashboard/)) will return shortly; absence of recent posts due to intense focus on several new trading strategies and a wonderful life event.]
