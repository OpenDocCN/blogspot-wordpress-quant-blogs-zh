## SEFs: New Market, New Opportunities

The FT offers a [view](http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/2782c986-40a4-11e3-8775-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2jMrOkgDr) on the opportunities SEFs have brought to the banks, even though the banks lobbied against the derivative reforms.  Accenture’s 2012 OTC Derivatives Market highlighted much the same opportunities:

> successful players will find opportunities for price aggregation across multiple execution venues to allow their clients access to a wide range of liquidity via a single platform

Curious, GreySpark Partners believe these single platforms, or single-dealer platforms (SDPs) should be replaced with a new quality of Digital Investment Banking ([DIB](http://greyspark.com/2013/10/01/investment-banks-must-devise-new-technology-platforms-to-remain-competitive-shows-greyspark-research/)) platforms.  DIB’s should offer:

> a cross asset, client centric approach which will set a new standard for SDP dealing capabilities and functionality, supporting the entire trade lifecycle
