# Falkenblog: Match of the Century

Kyle Dake wrestled David Taylor last weekend in a preseason match. Both are dominant college wrestlers, and they had a great match. Both were very cautious, and Dake won 2-1 in overtime (Taylor in blue, Dake in red, right). You can see it

Personally, I'm a Taylor fan. He goes for big moves more often, and I appreciate that. Sure, occasionally he gets pinned, but I prefer that type of style to the more methodical approach of Dake. I love guys who usually win big, risking the occasional loss, to those who never lose but do not dominate when they win. Their weight class has Tyler Caldwell of OSU as well, so this year should be very fun.
