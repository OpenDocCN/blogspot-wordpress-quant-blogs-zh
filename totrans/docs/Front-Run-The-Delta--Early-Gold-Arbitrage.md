"When I was settled in London, the East India Company had

£

800,000 worth of gold to sell.  I went to the sale, and bought it all.  I knew the Duke of Wellington must have it.  I had bought a great many of his bills at a discount.  The Government sent for me and said they must have it.  When they got it, they did not know how to get it to Portugal.  I undertook all that and I sent it to France; and that was the best business I ever did."

Nathan Rothschild, ~1811
