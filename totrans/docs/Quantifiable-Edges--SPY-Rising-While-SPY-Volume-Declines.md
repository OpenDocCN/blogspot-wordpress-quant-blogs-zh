# Quantifiable Edges: SPY Rising While SPY Volume Declines

> 来源：[http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2009/09/spy-rising-while-spy-volume-declines.html#0001-01-01](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2009/09/spy-rising-while-spy-volume-declines.html#0001-01-01)

In

[May of 2008 I showed](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2008/05/volume-pattern-that-makes-huge.html)

how 3 higher closes in the SPX (while under to 200ma) had different implications depending on the volume pattern. Tuesday we had this 3-higher closes pattern appear in the SPY while SPY volume declined all three days. This is a slightly different twist and one worth examining:

This setup appears especially bearish over the 1st week. Possible bearish implications extend out much further than just a week, though.

Would you like to be made aware any time this setup triggers in the future?

As I ready to publish this I see that Cobra also noticed this pattern last night.
