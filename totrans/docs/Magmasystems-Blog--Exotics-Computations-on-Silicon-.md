# Magmasystems Blog: Exotics Computations on Silicon?

Someone floated an idea that sounded interesting ...

Has anyone heard of writing their calc functions in C, and burning them onto field programmable gate arrays? The calc models would have to be fairly static, but it might be able to give you magnitudes of speed improvements.

I confess that I know very little about this technology, but it bears some investigation.

Hopefully J.O'S can weigh in with something on his blog....

is an interesting article.
