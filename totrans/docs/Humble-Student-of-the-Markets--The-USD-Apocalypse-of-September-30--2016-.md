# Humble Student of the Markets: The USD Apocalypse of September 30, 2016?

A reader asked me today if I knew anything about a forecast of an imminent US Dollar Apocalypse of September 30, 2016\. After digging around, I found this article on

[Daily Reckoning](http://dailyreckoning.com/d-day-minus-one-for-us-dollar/)

. It turns out that the Chinese RMB is going to get included in the Special Drawing Rights (SDR) basket of currencies as of 4pm on Friday, September 30, 2016\. The weight of CNY is going to be 10.9%, which is higher than the weight of the Japanese Yen at 8.3%.

The story of RMB inclusion in SDR is another nail in the coffin of King Dollar. The article then went on to reiterate the thesis about the destruction of the USD as a store of value.

The obvious solution is, of course, to buy gold. Oh, PUH-LEEZ!

Sorry to disappoint the goldbugs, but some simple calculations show that gold to be an inferior investment to a USD cash position if we factor in T-Bill interest payments.
