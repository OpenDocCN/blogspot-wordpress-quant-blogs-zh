Several Wall Street companies have gotten big fines when the exchanges have found out that people or "interrogation devices" that were not entitled to use market data were actually using it. Try looking at this document and see if you can figure out what you need to license if you have a single PC with several different WinForms apps, each app capable of letting one user see the NASDAQ data feed. And, what happens if there are multiple users on that PC?

My colleague Craig tells me that the fee structure imposed by the various exchanges is one of the main driving points for my "Common Wall Street Client Stack", with various applets running inside of one desktop shell.

Wonder if NASDAQ will start charging per AppDomain?
