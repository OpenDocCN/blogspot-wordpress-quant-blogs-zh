# Humble Student of the Markets: A misogynist antidote

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2013/09/a-misogynist-antidote.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2013/09/a-misogynist-antidote.html#0001-01-01)

Is it just me? Maybe I just an old fogey. Or perhaps it's because I have a daughter that my attitudes towards women have changed, but the latest outrage at Saint Mary's University in Halifax, the other side of Canada, had me shaking my head. During frosh week, student leaders reported chanted a chant that had been passed down from one year of students to the next (see the CBC story and video clip

[here](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/story/2013/09/05/ns-saint-marys-video-apology.html)

):

> The chant during orientation week activities had students spelling the word “young” by saying “Y is for your sister, O is for oh so tight, U is for underage, N is for no consent, G is for grab that ass, SMU boys we like them young.”

As an antidote, I was amused to see this

done by some New Zealand law students in response to the misogynist music video of Robin Thicke's
