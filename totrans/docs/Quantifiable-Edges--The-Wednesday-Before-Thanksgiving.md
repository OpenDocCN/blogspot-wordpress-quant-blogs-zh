# Quantifiable Edges: The Wednesday Before Thanksgiving

> 来源：[http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2011/11/wednesday-before-thanksgiving.html#0001-01-01](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2011/11/wednesday-before-thanksgiving.html#0001-01-01)

Thanksgiving has typically shown some pretty consistent seasonality.  Both the Wednesday before and the Friday after have exhibited bullish tendencies while the Monday after has been slightly bearish.

[ Last year I showed a table breaking it all down by day](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2010/11/thanksgiving-week-tendencies-revisited.html)

.  Today I decided to show a profit curve that represents simply owning the SPX from Tuesday's close through Wednesday's close.

Futures are down quite a bit this morning, so it may be difficult to keep this curve moving higher today, but over the years the next couple of days has been a pretty good bullish bet.  And when seasonality is this consistent it is often worth keeping in mind.
