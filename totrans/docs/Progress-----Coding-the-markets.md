## Progress ?

### June 6, 2012

[prog21 blogs that progress](http://prog21.dadgum.com/140.html) in software tech is slower than one might think. I suggest it’s slower than even prog21 thinks, possibly negative even. Xerox had the [Alto running in 1973](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerox_Alto), and it had a GUI & mouse, TCP/IP networking and a Smalltalk-72 programming environment. So how much fundamental progress has there been since 1973 ?
