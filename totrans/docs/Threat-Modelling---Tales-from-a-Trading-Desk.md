# Threat Modelling | Tales from a Trading Desk

## Threat Modelling

With the uptake of Rich Internet Application (RIA) electronic trading systems, financial institutions have had to increase the focus on security from both a systems perspective, and a training/education perspective.  Specifically, with the move to enabling financial clients (external customer) with internet applications, the need for the development teams who build those systems has become paramount.  Historically the development teams of financial applications lived within the financial corporations firewalls, and thus the already high level of internal security partially avoid the development team from having to learn about the threat of Man-In-The-Browser [attacks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-browser), as the financial institution controlled the LAN, browser, desktop, building entry etc.  Hence what follows are a few relevant reading items for any teams venturing down the security Threat Model road:
