## Markov Model and Trading History

Interesting [read](http://pkghosh.wordpress.com/2013/04/15/smarter-email-marketing-with-markov-model/) over on Mawazo about smarter email marketing with Markov Model.  I wonder if instead of predicting when to send emails, one can predict the next trade, or RFQ?

> Once we have the model, we will be able to predict, given the recent transactions of a customer, when the customer is likely to make the next purchase and how much he or she is likely to spend
