# Humble Student of the Markets: Time to sound the all-clear?

**Mid-week market update**: Is time to sound the all-clear? The market staged a relief rally after last week's weakness. Is the stock market ready to resume its uptrend?

A rally to new highs from these levels is unlikely. Last week's pullback inflicted significant technical damage that, at a minimum, a period of sideways consolidation and base building will be necessary before the bulls can take control of the tape again. The S&P 500 violated a rising trend line that stretched back to April. As well, the 8 day moving average (dma) fell through the 21 dma, which is a bearish crossover. Repairing the damage will take time.
