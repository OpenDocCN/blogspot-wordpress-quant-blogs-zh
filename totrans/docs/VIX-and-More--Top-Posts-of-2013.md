# VIX and More: Top Posts of 2013

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2014/01/top-posts-of-2013.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2014/01/top-posts-of-2013.html#0001-01-01)

Every year I tabulate the most-read posts in this space as a way to monitor the issues that are resonating with readers and also to see how these issues evolve over time. These most-read posts also serve as easily accessible repositories of high-quality material for the benefit of new readers and long-term readers alike.

The top themes from 2013 echo some top themes that resonated with readers from previous years, including continued interest in [VIX spikes](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20spikes) and SPX pullbacks, as well as the [VIX ETPs](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20ETN), low volatility ETPs, [the Fed](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/FOMC), interest rates and various global flash points, such as [emerging markets](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/emerging%20markets).

The posts below represent those that have been read by the highest number of unique readers during 2013\. Farther down there are links to similar lists going back to 2008, along with several other “best of” type posts that I have flagged for [archival](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/archival) purposes.

For the record, each year I also attach the [hall of fame](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/hall%20of%20famehttp:/vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/01/week-in-vix-january-7-2007-introduction.html) label to a handful of posts that I believe have particularly compelling and/or original content, regardless of readership. I find it interesting that ten posts from 2013 made it into the hall of fame – a record for any single year. Part of the reason for this is that while my total number of posts for 2013 was low, I favored quality and more in-depth analysis than pithy commentary, most of which I have migrated to my Twitter handle feed, [@VIXandMore](https://twitter.com/VIXandMore)

The most-read posts on VIX and More in 2013 were:
