This South Park

[special](http://www.southparkstudios.com/full-episodes/s11e05-fantastic-easter-special)

on Easter has the following scene that made me spit milk out my nose:

> Jesus: we have no choice Kyle, you're going to have to kill me
> Kyle:what?
> Jesus: Stab me with this, if I die I can resurrect outside the bars
> Kyle: Dude, you don't understand, I'm a Jew, I have a few hangups about killing Jesus.
> Jesus: Make it quick, through the neck
> Kyle: Eric Cartman can never know about this
