# Magmasystems Blog: New Coral8 5.2 Released

> 来源：[http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2008/02/new-coral8-52-released.html#0001-01-01](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2008/02/new-coral8-52-released.html#0001-01-01)

This is from the Coral8 website. You may recognize some of these enhancements as things that may have been deficiencies when I detailed my use case a few months. Some of the enhancements catch Coral8 up to some of the features that its competitors have. (ie: Bucket Windows)

Good job, boys!
