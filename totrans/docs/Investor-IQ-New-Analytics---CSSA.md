# Investor IQ New Analytics | CSSA

> 来源：[https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2019/06/24/investor-iq-new-analytics/#0001-01-01](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2019/06/24/investor-iq-new-analytics/#0001-01-01)

We have added some new analytics to the Investor IQ report. The signals are generated using a composite of 28 different momentum and trend-following signals over time frames ranging from 1-12 months. The number of buy signals determines whether the overall signal is “buy”, “hold” or “sell.” The “Trend Strength” is a new feature which shows the percentage of buy signals across the 28 different momentum and trend systems. This allows users to differentiate between the strength of the trend across ETFs or stocks. The “Volatility Score” is also a new feature which shows the relative volatility ranking (low ranking=lower volatility) from 0-100 across all ETFs or stocks. This can provide insight into relative risk and also allow users to form lower volatility portfolios with relative ease. A visual of the new output can be seen below:
