# VIX and More: Two Blogs to Read Every Weekend

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/08/two-blogs-to-read-every-weekend.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/08/two-blogs-to-read-every-weekend.html#0001-01-01)

![](img/b55033a21c0169b749684346c416577e.png)Since I write to a largely anonymous audience, I have no idea what sources of information my collective readership relies on to make informed decisions about the markets.  In less than a year of doing this, I find I now rarely bother with the print versions of the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Investor’s Business Daily, etc.  Increasingly, I find myself relying on almost 200 blogs, with [Bloglines](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/04/bloglines-and-information-waterworks.html) as my feed management tool to filter, sort, rank and present everything I think I might want to think about.

I do most of my macro thinking about investments and markets on the weekends, where there is enough white space in my life to worry more about strategy than tactics, planning than execution, and portfolios than individual holdings.

Yes I still read the New York Times business section on the weekend and I pick up a copy of Barron’s from time to time, but there are two blogs that consistently provide exactly what I am looking for each weekend – and a very different fashion.  I assume most readers know about these blogs already, but in the event you do not, you owe it to yourself to check them out, weekends or otherwise.

The first blog is Bill Cara’s [eponymous blog](http://www.billcara.com/) and it is as comprehensive a look at the investment world as I can manage in one sitting.  Every week Bill boils the ocean and provides an excellent commentary and broad set of charts that cover just about every investment nook and cranny.  Try his [July 28, 2007 Week in Review](http://www.billcara.com/archives/2007/07/week_in_review_30_20070728.html#more) on for starters, but don’t stop there.

An entirely different approach comes from Declan Fallon, whose work shows up in several locations, including his [Fallond Picks](http://blog.fallondpicks.com/) blog.  Declan surveys the landscape of the [top chartists at StockCharts.com](http://stockcharts.com/def/servlet/Favorites.CServlet?obj=public&cmd=show&disp=RED) and cherry picks what he thinks are the most meaningful charts and associated commentary, covering a wide variety of topics.  Check out the [July 22](http://blog.fallondpicks.com/2007/07/stockchartscom-weekly-review_22.html) and [July 14](http://blog.fallondpicks.com/2007/07/stockchartscom-weekly-review_14.html) installments of his weekly review of what others at StockCharts have been saying about the market.

If you make these two blogs part of your regular weekend reading, you could argue that the better first stop would be the broad brush strokes from Declan, followed by the more intensive drill down with Bill.  Heck, go ahead and read Barron’s, IBD and the New York Times too.  Just be ready with a plan and a couple of different scenarios to look for when the bell rings on Monday.
