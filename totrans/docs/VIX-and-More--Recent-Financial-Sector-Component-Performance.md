# VIX and More: Recent Financial Sector Component Performance

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/03/recent-financial-sector-component.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/03/recent-financial-sector-component.html#0001-01-01)

Back in early December, in [Breaking Down the Financial Sector Post-Lehman](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/12/breaking-down-financial-sector-post.html), I contrasted the broad-based KBW Bank Index ETF ([KBE](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/KBE)) with several other KBW financial sector ETFs, notably [KRE](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=KRE) (KBW regional banking index), [KCE](http://finance.yahoo.com/q/pr?s=KCE) (KBW capital markets index) and [KIE](http://finance.yahoo.com/q/pr?s=KIE) (KBW insurance index.) At that time, the regional banking index was holding up better than its siblings, but had begun to show some weakness.

Fast forward almost four months and in the chart below I contrast the performance of the same quartet of ETFs since the November 21^(st) bottom (SPX 741), when things probably looked darkest for the financial sector.

Notice that now the capital markets group (with top holdings of [GS](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/GS), [MS](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/MS), [CME](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/CME), [SCHW](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SCHW) and [STT](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/STT)) is sporting gains of over 20% since this period, while insurance stocks are almost back to breaking even and both banking ETFs, the regional and money center variants, have been bring up the rear, moving almost in lockstep as of late and showing losses in excess of 25% for the period in question. All four groups have bounced impressively off of the March lows, but once again, it is the capital markets group that has showed the most strength, with State Street (STT) leading the way.
