## 2014 Prediction: Stand-alone Web Streaming Products follow the Dinosaurs

Not a difficult prediction to make 🙂 given what has happened to a few already – my-Channels.  Node.js ([Socket.io](http://socket.io/)) and [Vert.x](http://vertx.io/) offer the foundations for interesting Open Source solutions that avoid the ongoing maintenance costs.  Stand-alone web streaming products have similarities with the CEP products of n years ago.  In CEP land, we had merger of CEP product companies, followed by CEP product companies being purchased by large software houses.  The same is already happening with web streaming product companies.
