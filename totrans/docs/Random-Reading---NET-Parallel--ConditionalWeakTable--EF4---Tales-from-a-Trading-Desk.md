## Random Reading: .NET Parallel, ConditionalWeakTable, EF4

*   In my view CLR via C# is required reading for any C# developer. The Microsoft Press blog has an [extract](http://blogs.msdn.com/microsoft_press/archive/2010/02/24/jeffrey-richter-excerpt-3-from-clr-via-c-third-edition.aspx) from the Third Edition of Richter’s book offering some insight into [ConditionalWeakTable](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd287757(VS.100).aspx).
*   [Comparing](http://www.infoq.com/news/2010/01/Comparing-NHibernate-EF-4) NHibernate and EF 4 – the debate will rage for sometime, but at least EF4 has [improved](http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2010/01/11/entity-framework-in-net-4.aspx) things. On a similar topic, [NHModeller](http://nhmodeller.selfip.com/Default.aspx) is worth a look – DSL based NHibernate generation tool
*   WF4 runtime [performance](http://blogs.msdn.com/endpoint/archive/2010/02/10/wf4-runtime-performance.aspx)
*   Gallery of Processor Cache [Effects](http://igoro.com/archive/gallery-of-processor-cache-effects/)
*   Reading the [comments](http://blogs.msdn.com/pfxteam/archive/2010/02/07/9937451.aspx) on this Parallel Extension posting, the question Microsoft needs to answer soon is “When will TPL be available for Silverlight?”. [Maintaining a Consistent Application State with TPL](http://blogs.msdn.com/pfxteam/archive/2010/02/09/9960735.aspx) provide insight is to the advantages of adding TPL to Silverlight. For example, you could see an [RFQ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_quotation) taking advantage of TPL.
