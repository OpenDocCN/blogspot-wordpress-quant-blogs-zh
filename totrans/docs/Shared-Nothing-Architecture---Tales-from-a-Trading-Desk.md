## Shared Nothing Architecture

Dark Pools (see provide blog posting) captures [Josh](http://wp.josh.com/) Levine comments, which I can only agree with, that not enough people understand and thus architect [shared-nothing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_nothing_architecture) solutions.  [Island](http://www.hofstra.edu/pdf/biz_mlc_concannon1.pdf) was ahead of the competitions in its day in terms of architecture, and thus latency.  Even today, there are still limited shared nothing architectures in many of the financial silo’s 😦

Finally, check out the source [code](http://josh.com/notes/island-ecn-10th-birthday/ISLAND.PRG.TXT) that Josh [release](http://josh.com/notes/island-ecn-10th-birthday/) some time ago, specifically around the matching engine
