## Pancake Stack: End-to-End, Real-time ML and AI Pipeline

InfoQ has an interesting [read](https://www.infoq.com/articles/fregly-pancake-stack) on the last-mile of the[Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) machine [learning](http://advancedspark.com/) pipeline, “Chris Fregly on the PANCAKE STACK Workshop and Data Pipelines”.

Its interesting to read that even Netflix and other struggled in this space:

> The idea for PipelineIO dates back a few years to my time at Netflix where we were forced to build a custom ML prediction/serving layer. There wasn’t – and still isn’t, in my opinion – a production-ready, fault-tolerant, and low latency open source system to serve Netflix-scale predictions and recommendations in real-time

[PipelineIO](http://pipeline.io/) offers a good architecture overview on its home page:
