# VIX and More: Best Hurricane Blog Out There?

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/08/best-hurricane-blog-out-there.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/08/best-hurricane-blog-out-there.html#0001-01-01)

I am by no means a weather junkie, although many years of sailing have helped transform my curiosity about weather systems and related phenomena into just enough knowledge to get me into trouble.

As I am also interested in market volatility and the commodities markets, each [hurricane](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/hurricanes) season gives me an opportunity to scour the web to update my favorite hurricane links, which seem to increase in quantity and quality each year.

There is one hurricane blog out there that strikes me as the undoubtedly best in the business:  [Dr. Jeff Masters Wunder Blog](http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/).  Masters is one of the founders of [The Weather Underground](http://www.wunderground.com/) (that would be the meteorologists, not the [radical bombers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weatherman_%28organization%29)) and his blog is well written and filled with top notch content. The Wunder Blog has also attracted the attention of quite a few aficionados who do a surprisingly good job of augmenting Masters’ content in the comments section.

*Side note:*  if you ever wanted to know what it is like to fly into the eye of a major hurricane, check out Masters’ harrowing account of [Hunting Hugo](http://www.wunderground.com/education/hugo1.asp)
