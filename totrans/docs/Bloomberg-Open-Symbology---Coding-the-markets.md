## Bloomberg Open Symbology

### April 12, 2010

I’ve [posted in the past](https://etrading.wordpress.com/2007/02/08/bloomberg-tickers/) about the irrationality of the naming scheme for Bloomberg ticker symbols. Well, Bloomberg have taken a step in the right direction and [launched a site](http://bsym.bloomberg.com/sym/) that allows developers to look up ticker symbols. If you’re looking for Rates products you’ll find US Treasuries under the Government top level heading. No EGBs or Gilts yet. And you’ll find IRSs under Currencies, which seems odd to me as a rates person.
