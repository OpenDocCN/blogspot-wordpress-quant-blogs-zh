# Humble Student of the Markets: Spambot infection

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2010/04/spambot-infection.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2010/04/spambot-infection.html#0001-01-01)

My XP operating system computer has been infected with a spambot that hijacks my machine and sends out spam every four or five days. The malware goes through my Outlook Express address book and sends out spam (ten addresses per spam) and the offending emails show up in my sent items box.

I have tried a variety of virus scanners and found nothing. Other than the standard ones, I have also tried:

*   Spyware Doctor
*   Superantispyware
*   Spyware S&D

I ran Microsoft Network Monitor and found all sorts of internet traffic to suspect sites in Latin America, Asia and Europe when the computer was supposedly idle. If you have any suggestions please email me at cam at hbhinvestments dot com.
