## PDC 2009 Day 1 Blog Reading

[All Your Base Are Belong To Us](http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs/sasha/archive/2009/11/17/pdc-2009-day-1-future-directions-for-c-and-visual-basic.aspx) offers interesting reading on Future Directions for C# and Visual Basic. It appear Microsoft is going to port the C# compiler from C++ to C# and the VB.NET compiler to VB.NET. Curious why this is going to happen. Is it due to .NET 4.0 features, performance?

Data Programming and Modeling session looks to have been interesting, especially given the move into SQL land for [Oslo](http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs/idof/archive/2009/11/17/pdc-blogging-data-programming-and-modeling.aspx).

[Essential WPF](http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs/tomershamam/archive/2009/11/18/session-how-microsoft-visual-studio-2010-was-built-with-wpf-4.aspx) capture some important lessons learnt by Microsoft on using WPF to build VS 2010.

DryadLINQ on Azure would be [cool](http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs/sasha/archive/2009/11/18/pdc-2009-day-1-data-intensive-computing-on-windows-hpc-server-with-the-dryadlinq-framework.aspx).
