## Cucumber and Distributed Application Testing – Part 2

Continuing on from the previous posting.  If one decided to annotate the PlantUML flows with max latency data one could then possibly consider leveraging [Application Tap for Solarflare](http://www.ts-a.com/attachments/apptap-for-solarflare.pdf) from a cucumber test  perspective to capture the hop latency, and validate the flows via the data capture [database](http://www.ts-a.com/attachments/Application_Tap_Product_Briefing.pdf).  Anyone tried such a thing?
