# Win8+ Roadmap Speculation – Tongue-in-cheek | Tales from a Trading Desk

## Win8+ Roadmap Speculation – Tongue-in-cheek

This posting is total speculation (very much [Tongue-in-cheek](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue-in-cheek)), looking forwards into the post Windows 8 future UI roadmap. Based on what Microsoft said at BUILD, I suspect a number of people a thinking similar thoughts:

*   XAML and HTML – Why have the choice? If the world is going HTML5, then why not start to phase out XAML, and move to 100% HTML as the markup language. Prediction: XAML will become legacy in future.
*   Win8 Metro style is Microsoft attempting to improve the application build/deployment/run experience. WinRT and all its goodness is clearly the UI framework of the future. Prediction: WinRT will become the CLR of the future.
*   CLR and [Chakra](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2010/03/18/the-new-javascript-engine-in-internet-explorer-9.aspx). With the browser world ever increasing JavaScript performance since Google came out with [V8](http://code.google.com/p/v8/). Coupled with that fact that Chakra doesn’t appear to be leveraging the CLR, even though Microsoft has a whole wrath of languages on the CLR – C#, VB, IronPython and [JScript .NET](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JScript) to name but a few. Prediciton: Chakra is the new CLR
*   C#, VB, C++ and JavaScript. We all have our favourite language. C++ back into the fray as a first class language is interesting and with AMP has an appropriate place. But what about C# and VB? Prediciton: JavaScript and C++ rule
