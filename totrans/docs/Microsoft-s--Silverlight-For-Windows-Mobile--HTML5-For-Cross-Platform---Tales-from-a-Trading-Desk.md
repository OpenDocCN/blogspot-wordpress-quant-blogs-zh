## Microsoft’s: Silverlight For Windows Mobile, HTML5 For Cross-Platform

So as expected the blog world has gone mad over the PDC10 comment about [Silverlight](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/microsoft-our-strategy-with-silverlight-has-shifted/7834). [Shawn](http://wildermuth.com/2010/10/30/Post-PDC_HTML5_v_Silverlight_Debate) has an interesting take on both. UXPassion also has a [view](http://wildermuth.com/2010/10/30/Post-PDC_HTML5_v_Silverlight_Debate).

Personally, as I’ve blogged about before, I don’t see the corp world moving to IE9 as soon as its released – lets get real here, some corps (sell-side) are still on IE6/7! We should also remember that today Apple’s AppStore don’t allow HTML5!

So in summary, I agree with UXPassion’s final comments, “Silverlight will be here for years to come”
