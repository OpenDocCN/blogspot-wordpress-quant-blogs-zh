# Humble Student of the Markets: The ways your trading model could leading you astray

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2017/01/the-ways-your-trading-model-could.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2017/01/the-ways-your-trading-model-could.html#0001-01-01)

I have had a number of discussions with subscribers asking for more "how to" posts (see

[Teaching my readers how to fish](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/03/11/teaching-my-readers-how-to-fish/)

). This will be one of a series of occasional posts on how to build a robust investment process.

For traders and investors, one of the challenges is how to build a robust discipline that works well through different market regimes. As a case study, consider this study from

[Simple Stock Model](https://www.simplestockmodel.com/sentiment/)

 that generates signals based on the cash flows in and out of the SPY ETF as a sentiment signal. The trading rule is: "If the 4-week average of the 3-month change in SPY's percentage of shares outstanding is greater than +5%, be out of the market."

The chart below shows the equity curve from this trading system (white line = buy and hold, blue line = trading system). The results look pretty good, especially for a relatively low turnover model. (Incidentally, it's on a sell signal right now).

Not so fast! Don't jump to conclusions before digging into the data and reading the fine print.
