# VIX and More: Dr. Brett on Put to Call Ratios

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/03/dr-brett-on-put-to-call-ratios.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/03/dr-brett-on-put-to-call-ratios.html#0001-01-01)

I was away for the weekend and am still catching up in my reading, but it looks like [Brett Steenbarger](http://www.brettsteenbarger.com/) saved me a post on the [abnormally low put to call ratios](http://traderfeed.blogspot.com/2007/03/bearish-equity-put-call-ratio-what-to.html).

According to Dr. Brett, [Jason Goepfert](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search?q=goepfert)’s [SentimenTrader.com](http://www.sentimentrader.com/) apparently has a more in-depth discussion of the put to call issue.  I should add that I am not a subscriber to SentimenTrader, but have had it on my To Do list for a couple of months.

Finally, some of the more observant readers may have noticed that I added a [link to the ISEE](http://www.iseoptions.com/marketplace/statistics/sentiment_index.asp) at the upper right hand corner of this blog last week.  The ISEE is a sentiment index (in this case, a ratio of call to put options, multiplied by 100) compiled by the [International Securities Exchange](http://www.iseoptions.com/about/company/company_history.asp) or ISE.  In some respects, it is similar to the [put to call ratios at the CBOE](http://www.cboe.com/data/IntraDayVol.aspx), but without the heavy institutional action in the indices that tends to dominate the activity on the CBOE.

I have been looking hard at the ISEE in the past week because of the unusually low readings, including consecutive all-time lows (data go back to 2002) in the 10 day SMA last Wednesday and Thursday.

Stay tuned for more on [put to call](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/put%20to%20call) data, what it means, and its predictive power.
