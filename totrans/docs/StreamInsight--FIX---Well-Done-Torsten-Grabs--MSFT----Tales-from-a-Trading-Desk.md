## StreamInsight: FIX – Well Done Torsten Grabs (MSFT)

Having spent some time working with the Microsoft StreamInsight team over the last few years, I have to say that Torsten and the team do at least get finance, which is unfortunately more than I can say for some other teams 😦 The FIX StreamInsight [adapters](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/streaminsight/archive/2011/06/13/fix-adapter-for-streaminsight.aspx) are an [appropriate](http://www.hedgehogs.net/pg/blog/corballis/read/8649794/rapid-addition-to-demo-fixenabled-cep-in-conjunction-with-microsoft-at-sifma) step forwards. My challenge to Torsten and the team is to match Sybase [Aleri](http://www.sybase.co.uk/products/financialservicessolutions/aleristreamingplatform?htab=Tab+Holder&vtab=High+Performance&hid=84134&vid=84184) in providing [STAC](http://www.stacresearch.com) Benchmarks ([STAC-A1](http://www.stacresearch.com/a1))

> Mean latency not exceeding approximately 1.5 [milliseconds](http://www.sybase.co.uk/products/financialservicessolutions/aleristreamingplatform?htab=Tab+Holder&vtab=High+Performance&hid=84134&vid=84184) at ingress rates of up to 180,000 order book updates per second and 1.6 ms at 300,000 updates per second.

Coupled with performance numbers for FIX:

> In [benchmark](http://www.highfrequencytraders.com/article/647/streambase-launches-updated-cep-software) testing, the new StreamBase FIX engine has clocked in at 50-75 microseconds send time depending on message size, all while running on Linux and commodity hardware.
