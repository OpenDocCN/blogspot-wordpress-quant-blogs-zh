## OSGi, Java Platform Module – Java 9

With less than a year away from the Java 9 [release](https://blogs.oracle.com/java/entry/java_9_schedule_is_out), its interesting to see a preliminary [discussion](https://dzone.com/articles/from-osgi-to-jigsaw-1) of OSGi and the new Java Platform Module System.  Summary provides a good perspective of the two module system.  Remember the [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) principle 🙂

> Yes, it is less dynamic than the OSGi original. On the other hand, it is also vastly less complex. OSGi service dynamics are cool, but it makes you handle lots of (concurrency) edge-cases. Do you really need these dynamics all the time?
