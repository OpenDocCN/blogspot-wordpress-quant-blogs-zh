**Mid-week market update**

: Stock prices are still consolidating sideways. The technical pattern could either be described as range-bound, or as a triangle. The market tested the bottom of the triangle this week, but support held.

The market indecision could be traced to the continued disagreement between fundamental and technical investors. Several weeks ago, I highlighted a
