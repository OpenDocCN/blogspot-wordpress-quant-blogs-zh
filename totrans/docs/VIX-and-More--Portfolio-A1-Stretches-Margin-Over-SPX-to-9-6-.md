# VIX and More: Portfolio A1 Stretches Margin Over SPX to 9.6%

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/11/portfolio-a1-stretches-margin-over-spx.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/11/portfolio-a1-stretches-margin-over-spx.html#0001-01-01)

Continuing the strong bounce off of the mid-August lows, Portfolio A1 exited the week with fewer scars than that of the benchmark S&P 500 index.  Now up 13.3% since the February 16, 2007 inception, the portfolio’s performance compares favorably to a 3.7% gain in the SPX.  In spite of the recent performance, as I have discussed [previously](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/08/portfolio-a1-looks-to-ag-to-stop.html), I will retire the 100% mechanical Portfolio A1 at the end of the calendar year and replace it with a more complex portfolio that incorporates some discretionary thinking and more active management on my part.

This week one marginal performer, [Shanda Interactive (SNDA)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=snda&hl=en), the Chinese internet company, is being dropped from the portfolio and will be replaced by [StatoilHydro (STO)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=sto), the state-owned Norwegian oil giant.

There are no other changes to the portfolio this week.

A snapshot of the portfolio is as follows:
