# Humble Student of the Markets: Brexit fallout watch

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2016/06/brexit-fallout-watch.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2016/06/brexit-fallout-watch.html#0001-01-01)

Well, my Bremain call didn't go so well (see

[Positioning for a Bremain result](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/06/22/positioning-for-a-bremain-result/)

). As I write this, the BBC has called the referendum in favor of Leave by a margin of 52-48\. GBPUSD is down about 10% and Asian stock markets are down 2-4%.

If you were correctly positioned for this outcome, congratulations, but don`t get overly excited about doing a victory lap as there is going to be market volatility ahead. During these episodes of unexpected market shocks, here is what I am watching for:

*   **Technical:** Watch for logical areas of technical support
*   **Sentiment:** Signs of panic and oversold reading that signal a bottom
*   **Macro:** Either official intervention or policy responses that could rip a short`s face off
