# Humble Student of the Markets: NAAIM buy signal update

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2017/09/naaim-buy-signal-update.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2017/09/naaim-buy-signal-update.html#0001-01-01)

I had highlighted an unusual contrarian buy signal in my last post (see

[Round number-itis at 2500](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2017/09/19/round-number-itis-at-2500/)

). NAAIM sentiment, which is reported weekly, turned anomalously bearish last week and fell below its lower Bollinger Band. Past episodes of such occurrences have turned out to be very good contrarian buy signals.

The reading last week was anomalous because every other sentiment indicator had become more bullish, while NAAIM RIAs got more bearish. This week, NAAIM managers turned more bullish, while the AAII survey became more cautious.

Was last week's contrarian buy signal for real, or a data blip?
