# Humble Student of the Markets: The path to Magnificent Exuberance

Signs of technical deteriorations had been appearing last week, but NVIDIA’s earnings report saved the day. The earnings report can best be described as a blowout. The results beat Street expectations on all metrics and the company guided upwards. There wasn’t anything not to dislike about the report. As a consequence, the Semiconductor Index, which is a bellwether for artificial intelligence (AI) related plays, rallied strongly after briefly testing the lower bound of its absolute and relative return rising channels.

Even though some excesses are appearing, I reiterate my view that the AI bubble has far more room to run before it reaches the phase of Magnificent Exuberance (see [Why this AI bull is nothing like the NASDAQ in 2000](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2024/02/11/why-this-ai-bull-is-nothing-like-nasdaq-in-2000/)).
