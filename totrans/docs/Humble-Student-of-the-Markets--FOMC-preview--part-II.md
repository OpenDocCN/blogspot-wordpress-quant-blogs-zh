# Humble Student of the Markets: FOMC preview, part II

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2016/12/fomc-preview-part-ii.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2016/12/fomc-preview-part-ii.html#0001-01-01)

Further to my last post (see

[Watch the reaction, not just the Fed](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/12/11/watch-reaction-not-just-fed/)

), I got a number of questions that asked if there are any factors or nuances from the FOMC statement or subsequent press conference to watch for.

Firstly, I reiterate my point that the reaction to the Fed is far more important to the future direction of stock prices than the Fed statement itself. I expect that the Fed will try very hard to remain apolitical and refuse to react to any possible changes in fiscal policy until they are actually announced. Nevertheless, I will be watching if the committee makes any references to:

*   The strength of the US Dollar; and
*   Any possible changes in the projected path of inflation.

How the Fed views these factors will influence affect the pace of interest rate normalization in 2017.
