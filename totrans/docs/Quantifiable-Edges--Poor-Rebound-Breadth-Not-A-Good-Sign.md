# Quantifiable Edges: Poor Rebound Breadth Not A Good Sign

Originally published in the blog on 9/11/2008,

[the Quantifinder](http://www.quantifiableedges.com/quantifinderinfo.html)

noted the below breadth-based study for Tuesday’s close. I re-ran it in

[last night’s Subscriber Letter](http://www.quantifiableedges.com/gold.html)

and have updated it below.

*(Note: Up Volume % is tracked in the members chart area each night. It is equal to (Up volume / (Up volume + down volume).* *click table to enlarge*[![](img/a03081ad8d8609c52de40bf3b7e50493.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEimJI43l0N4Sp6gEtLv69IfSxUSgu_LIu12DOV4LkmBgNmUGgBBp5HV6TUrCK-o1DoTFQoor7Wq7AuJp8fo8yKPnIkexWgLEf20Ui7IrSsXXA7X_EfPcKp7m96nHGCWex6D24ictMcTPkII/s1600-h/2009-6-24+png1.png)

The fact that there was a pullback within three days every time is a fairly compelling stat. There have been 2 upmoves occur in the 6-day holding period since I published the first set of results last September. They both had pullbacks first though, allowing either opportunity for profit or at least a chance to move your stop to breakeven. Below I’ve listed all the trades along with their 6-day exit:

Note even the 2 most recent losers saw some sizable pullbacks. The 3/6/09 instance which came very close to the bottom was the worst of the bunch from a short perspective but still moved south by over 1.5% before launching higher.
