# Stream Processing | Tales from a Trading Desk

> 来源：[https://mdavey.wordpress.com/2014/12/12/stream-processing/#0001-01-01](https://mdavey.wordpress.com/2014/12/12/stream-processing/#0001-01-01)

## Stream Processing

Coupled of interesting presentations on [InfoQ](http://www.infoq.com/esp):

*   High [Throughput](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/acid-stream-processing) Stream Processing with ACID Guarantees
*   Mantis: Netflix’s Event Stream [Processing](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/mantis) System
*   Real-Time Stream Processing as Game [Changer](http://www.infoq.com/articles/stream-processing-hadoop) in a Big Data World with Hadoop and Data Warehouse

First video is from [CASK](http://cask.co/products/cdap/) which has a number of products that look interesting. Anyone played with the CASK products in a financial application context?  There’s a vague financial use case [here](http://cask.co/products/tigon/).  [Tigon](http://cask.co/products/tigon/) looks possibly interesting from a risk perspective, or depending on how low the latency is, maybe even pricing
