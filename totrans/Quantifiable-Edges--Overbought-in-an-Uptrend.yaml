    other words, strongly oversold conditions will often lead to a bounce and strongly
    overbought conditions will often lead to a pullback. The trick in trading a swing
    time frame is understanding when the likelihood to reverse is strong and when
    it isn’t.

    Often there will be no downside edge when trying to short into an overbought condition
    in an uptrend. When the market is strongly overbought due to a sharp acceleration
    in the trend as occurred late last week, it may even suggest an upside edge. Below
    is a study from last night’s subscriber letter that demonstrates this.

    There were some momentum studies in last night’s letter suggesting an even greater
    bullish edge. There are also a few active studies that suggest a mild pullback
    could be in order. In any case, the point is that though the market is short-term
    overbought, this is by no means an ideal short setup. And in general odds seem
    to favor a continuation rather than a strong, immediate drop.
