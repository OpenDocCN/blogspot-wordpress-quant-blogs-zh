    a lack of regulation, or too much government meddling, was the essence of the
    problem. As we clearly had a lack of regulation on the key risk contributors,
    one could plausibly argue either, as ‘more’ regulation may have mitigated the
    problem, but it may also have encouraged greater misplaced lending under the goal
    of increasing home ownership. I imagine that debate will not be definitively answered,
    just as the causes of the financial crises of 1893, 1907, 1929-33, 1974, 1998
    are hardly settled matters among economic historians.

    I know I agree with you in the fact that there are a lot of people who raised

    a general crisis for, well, ever, you can hardly be called prescient. To the extent
    there is a breakdown in the general milieu such as too much greed, or not enough
    regulation, seems sufficiently unfocused to be of little help.

    from 1990 until 2006, is any fear that perhaps these weaker lender standards that
    every government agency involved with housing tried to advance… might lead to
    high defaults, particularly if housing prices should stop rising”. In other words,
    the key to this problem, the essence of what caused mortgages to crash, was crazy
    lending standards, but no prominent people were highlighting these risk before
    the fact. But what is most insidious is that this error was made by everyone:
    originators, rating agencies and investment banks, investors. All along the chain,
    people with very different incentives and objectives ignored this risk. It is
    easy to see how Moody''s dropped the ball, but if the issuers wanted AAA ratings,
    and the investors wanted both AAA ratings, and stable ratings, Moody''s just gave
    them what they wanted. How could they all have been so blind to the problem suggested

    passengers would see the end game and thus be highly motivated to overtake them
    at very quickly, unlike prior to 9/11/01—the problem created by high risk mortgages
    is not something that needs Washington’s help at this moment. The market for these
    securities no longer exists. Indeed, the solution to create a new Department of
    Homeland Security Department, with its Transportation Safety Administration, may
    be just wasteful bureaucratic bloat, less able to respond to new risks.

    because if it is anticipated, it will be arbitraged away, and if a financial crisis
    by definition is a discontinuity in asset prices, then it means from one day to
    the next people were surprised. Something fundamentally different happened. I
    think that, and I have argued this, and I am not saying whether the government
    resources are relevant to this, I think the academic community could do it surely
    as well. And what we do have to understand is that our view of the way an economy
    functions is not properly modeled by what we now have.
