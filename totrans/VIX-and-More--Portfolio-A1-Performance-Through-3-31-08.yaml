    surprised and pleased to hear that several readers were using the portfolio’s
    selections to augment their own holdings.

    performance through the first quarter of 2008 – and thereafter on a quarterly
    basis.

- en: As the graphics below show, the Portfolio suffered its worst month to date in
    January, breaking a string from September through December in which the portfolio
    annihilated the benchmark S&P 500 index.  Despite the relatively disappointing
    performance in the first quarter of 2008, from a cumulative return perspective,
    Portfolio A1’s 5.3% return since the February 16, 2007 inception is still 14.4%
    better than the 9.1% loss suffered by the SPX during that period.

    has three model portfolios that are updated weekly:  Aggressive Trader; Growth;
    and Foreign Growth.  These were publicly launched in the newsletter on Sunday,
    but for the record, each of the three model portfolios have been up and running
    for the past 3-4 years and have significantly outperformed both the SPX and Portfolio
    A1 during comparable measurement periods.  Finally, there is also a Stock of the
    Week ‘Portfolio’ whose performance I will be tracking partly for posterity and
    partly for entertainment value.  For more details on the subscriber newsletter,
    click on the link in the upper right hand corner of the blog.'
