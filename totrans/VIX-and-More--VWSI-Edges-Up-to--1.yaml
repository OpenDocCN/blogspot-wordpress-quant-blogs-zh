- en: After three weeks of consecutive zero readings, the VIX Weekly Sentiment Indicator
    ([VWSI](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VWSI)) has moved off of dead
    center to +1.  The VIX closed the week at 12.76, down 0.16 from the previous week,
    marking the sixth week in a row that the VIX has closed in the 12s.

- en: While the VWSI is not going out on a limb to predict the direction of the next
    big move in the VIX, futures suggest that the consensus of opinion is that the
    VIX will be back over 15 in six months.  Predicting the path it will take to get
    there, however, is another task entirely.

- en: I am officially neutral on the VIX at the moment, with a watch and wait perspective.  For
    what it is worth, I probably will not be opening any long positions in the VIX
    unless it dips below 12.00 in the coming week.

    apply to the VIX, not to the broader markets, which are usually negatively correlated
    with the VIX.)
