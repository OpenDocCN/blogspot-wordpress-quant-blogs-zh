    random outliers among the many different programs being conducted. After all,
    one really great teacher undoubtedly can make a difference in such a small sample,
    but really great teachers, by definition, aren't easy to replicate. Heckman, as
    is his wont,

    of early childhood programs. In doing so he suggests that my evidence is highly
    selective. The effects reported for the programs I discuss survive batteries of
    rigorous testing procedures. They are conducted by independent analysts who did
    not perform or design the original experiments. The fact that samples are small
    works against finding any effects for the programs, much less the statistically
    significant and substantial effects that have been found.

    results--it has low 'power'--so Heckman is technically correct. But it's not as
    if these two programs were the only ones generated since 1962; these are really
    order statistics, not simple statistics. I see job seekers with fabulous backtests
    all the time, and cherry picking winning algorithms applied to a large class of
    rules is the most common problem.

    laid down in the mind before you reach eighteen." That a great econometrician
    could dismiss the clear selection bias in a couple of 60-kid studies selected
    out of hundreds (thousands?) highlights that no amount of education or intelligence
    can overcome one's prejudices, or overcome one's common sense.
