    collapse of government and electing corrupt candidates with their "secret" donations.
    Wrong, wrong and wrong. Unions ensure the rights of teachers being considered
    for firing to due process guaranteed by the Tenure Act, an act Republicans are
    eager to dismantle so that experienced, well-educated teachers can be replaced
    by cheaper, younger ones...

    finance, is hard to quantify, but I think they are really affecting things now.
    I know a CFO of a public company and he said they aren't developing in California
    because of all their regulations and obligations. Unfortunately, unlike taxes,
    regulations are much harder to scale back because they are so insidiously constructed,
    which is why it's very hard to turn around retarded countries like Greece and
    Spain that guarantee their workers so many things.
