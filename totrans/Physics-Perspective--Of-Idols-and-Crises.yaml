    are now in this financial and economic crisis, a few years downstream of the initial

    was a silence as they picked up the idol, polished it and put it back on the altar
    and now they''re hoping that nobody had noticed. The fact is, we''ve had three

    really need to fix the whole architecture of world capitalism, but nothing I''ve
    heard suggests that anybody''s doing that."'

    everything is patchwork, a few small repairs, even the illusion of repairs, and
    that's it.
