## BUILD JavaScript: Windows Tailored Apps

I particularly like the copyright notice at the top of the winjs files when you create a VS2011 JavaScript Windows Metro Style application:

> @ Microsoft. All Rights reserved.
> 
> This library is supported for Windows Tailored Apps only.
> 
> Build: 6.2.8100.0
> Version: 0.5
