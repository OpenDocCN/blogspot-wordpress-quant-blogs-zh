    investors in the 1990s confused MCI corp, the big phone company that is now dead.
    It had the ticker MCIC. So when news hit MCI, as would often happen, poor little
    MCI, which is totally different, would move, and then move back. A good exogenous
    experiment with stock supply curves.'

    now dead), which rose steadily in 2003 because some idiot inadvertently bought
    lots of stock every day for a few months. It rose from 7 to about 19 in 2003,
    when the error was discovered, and this guy owned 67% of the company by accident.
