    there is an army; where there is one piece of bad news, there is likely to be
    more in the pipeline), then the recent regional banking turmoil should come as
    no surprise.  Fundamentally, it was just a matter of time before the [subprime](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/subprime%20mortgage)>housing>credit
    crisis started to manifest itself on the balance sheets of those regional banks
    in the areas that have been hardest hit by the recent economic problems.

    made the biggest headlines in late April when it received a $7 billion capital
    infusion from an investment group led by Corsair Capital.  Just a week ago, NCC
    acknowledged that is operating essentially in a probationary mode governed by
    the contents of two memoranda of understanding with the Office of the Comptroller
    of the Currency and the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland.  The details of these
    MOUs have not been made public.

    which is also headquartered in Cleveland, has been one of the more spectacular
    examples.  Toward the end of May, KeyCorp doubled it estimates for write-offs
    for mortgages, HELOCs and educational loans just one month after raising write-off
    estimates when it reported earnings.  More recently, KeyCorp announced plans to
    raise $1.5 billion in new capital and slash its dividend 50%.

    in capital and slash its dividend 66%](http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/080618/fifth_third_stock_offer.html?.v=6).

    Lehman Brothers ([LEH](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/LEH)) as my
    [official financial sector fear indicator](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/06/lehvix.html)
    and replace it with one of the regional banking indices.  Better yet, why not
    make that a regional banking ETF, such as [RKH](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=rkh)
    (Regional Bank HOLDRS Trust), whose options status make it easy not only to keep
    track of price trends, but implied volatility trends (see chart below) as well.
