    of scenario number 3\. Most importantly, the plane was equipped with a beacon
    that would send a signal if the plane was about to crash into the ocean. The beacon
    never went off.

    of the airplane was a deliberate act. In fact, as of this morning it appears to
    be emerging that a series of deliberate acts were undertaken to minimize the likelihood
    that the plane could be tracked on radar.

    system. ATC could not track one of the hijacked airliners among the myriad of
    planes in the air because it had turned off its transponder. That episode begged
    the question, "If Russian Backfire bombers approached the US coast and was preparing
    to fire cruise missiles at Washington, did NORAD expect the Backfires to be transmitting
    transponder signals?"

- en: The disappearance of MH370 exposed another flaw in global ATC. When an aircraft
    is in international airspace over the ocean, they are not under the control of
    any country's ATC system. Airliners, however, do fly commonly specified routes
    at specified altitudes as then cross the ocean. When they enter a country's airspace,
    they then check in with local ATC, who then guides them.

    direction from Malaysia, a likely target under this scenario would be a oil facility
    in the Middle East. Imagine a flying bomb crashing into a large refining or oil
    export facility and taking out a significant portion of global production and
    you get the idea of the global impact of such an act.

    very difficult to just land a 777 somewhere out of the blue, hope that it won't
    be noticed by somebody and refuel it without detection. Any state that allows
