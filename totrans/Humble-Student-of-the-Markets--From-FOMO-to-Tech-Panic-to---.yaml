    earnings report. Callum Thomas performs an unscientific Twitter poll on weekends,
    and the bears have come out of the woodwork. Even if you are bearish, you have
    to ask yourself how much downside risk could there be at current levels? These
    conditions are indicative of the jittery nature of this market. A brief and minor
    pullback was enough to move sentiment to a crowded short reading.
