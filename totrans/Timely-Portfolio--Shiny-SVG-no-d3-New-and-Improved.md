# Timely Portfolio: Shiny SVG no d3–New and Improved

> 来源：[http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2012/12/shiny-svg-no-d3new-and-improved.html#0001-01-01](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2012/12/shiny-svg-no-d3new-and-improved.html#0001-01-01)

The fine author Joe Cheng of [RStudio Shiny](http://rstudio.com/shiny/) suggested [in this Google Groups message](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/shiny-discuss/s4GqcGwHV_o) to use htmlOutput rather than the ugly hack in my last post [R Shiny svg with no d3](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2012/12/r-shiny-svg-with-no-d3.html).  As I should have known, it works great and eliminates all the useless javascript.  Unless, you dig into the code, nothing changes, but I have posted a new [glimmer live example](http://glimmer.rstudio.com/timelyportfolio/shiny-grid-svg-v2) and the [code at Github](http://github.com/timelportfolio/shiny-grid-svg-v2).  For the ambitious, please feel free to use d3 now or other code to show how we could change colors and other aesthetics with javascript.
