    took direction from the directional market indicator in 2021, you paid for it.

    that told investors to do anything but buy have done them a disservice this year.
    In fact, when applied to the S&P 500, 15 of 22 chart-based indicators tracked
    by Bloomberg have actually lost money, back-testing data show. And all are doing
    worse than a simple buy-and-hold strategy, which is up 11%.

    they do, they rarely rely on a single charting technique to inform decisions.
    But if anything, the exercise is a reminder of the futility of calling a market
    top in a year when the journey has basically been a one-way trip.

    said Larry Williams, 78, creator of the Williams %R indicator that’s designed
    to capture a shift in a security’s momentum. A long-short strategy based on the
    technique is down 7.8% since the end of December.

    signal from BoA's private client holdings, indicate a record crowded long in equities
    which is contrarian bearish. However, how much can investors allocate to fixed-income
    instruments in an era of low and rising rates? Stocks are the only game in town,
    even for income investors.

    technical signals.
