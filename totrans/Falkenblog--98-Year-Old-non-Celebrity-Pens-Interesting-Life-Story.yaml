- en: ', about an immigrant who came to America in 1922\. It seems very interesting,
    and pretty remarkable to think that a 98 year old, who is not famous, would write
    a story about his childhood and that other people would care. What makes it interesting
    is there were a lot of important decisions that would have made a huge difference
    in his life, and this makes his life seem so much more special, contingent. Children
    of immigrants invariably have these butterfly effects, because, a small change
    in circumstances would have meant they stayed in their home country, or died in
    the Holocaust, or changed their career.'

  zh: ，关于一个 1922 年来到美国的移民。这似乎非常有趣，令人惊奇的是，一个 98 岁的普通人会写一篇关于他童年的故事，而其他人会在意。令人感兴趣的是，他的生活中有很多重要的决定，这使得他的生活似乎更加特别、偶然。移民的孩子们总是有这些蝴蝶效应，因为，环境的微小变化可能意味着他们留在自己的祖国，或者在大屠杀中丧生，或者改变他们的职业。
- en: I wonder, if my dad didn't take that job transfer and I grew up in Los Angeles
    instead of Cleveland, would I be really different? What about my choice in college?
    These are less important than Bernstein's big life changers, but the same point.
    I had a brief exchange with Andrew Sullivan while he was debating Sam Harris (Sam
    the hard-core atheist, Andrew the ecumenical Catholic), and he said that 'contingency'
    is one of the main reasons for his faith in God. That is, generally, we are grateful
    for our lot in life. If one of innumerable things in history were different, we
    would all be in a different situation, with different loved ones, jobs, etc. (given
    the average ejaculate contain 100MM sperm, your existence is already predicated
    on a large improbability) It's an interesting thought, and I don't see logically
    why this should make a God's existence more probable, but there is something compelling
    about it just the same. As if, God acts within the Heisenberg uncertainty limits,
    and these actions make all the difference in our lives.

  zh: 我想知道，如果我爸爸没有接受那份工作调动，我在洛杉矶长大，而不是在克利夫兰，我会变得真的不同吗？我的大学选择呢？这些比伯恩斯坦的重大生活变化者要不那么重要，但是同一个道理。我曾与安德鲁·沙利文交流过一次，当时他正在与萨姆·哈里斯（萨姆是坚定的无神论者，安德鲁是普世的天主教徒）辩论，他说“偶然性”是他信仰上帝的主要原因之一。也就是说，总的来说，我们对生活中的一切都心存感激。如果历史上无数的事情之一有所不同，我们都会处于不同的境地，拥有不同的亲人、工作等等。（考虑到平均射精含有
    1 亿精子，你的存在本身就是基于一种很大的偶然性）这是一个有趣的想法，从逻辑上讲，我不明白为什么这会使上帝的存在更有可能，但它确实有一些引人入胜的地方。就好像，上帝在海森堡不确定性限制内行动，而这些行动在我们的生活中造成了所有的不同。
- en: Several times I have had an older person tell me their life story, and damn
    if it wasn't very interesting. My old building supervisor told me about coming
    to America at 19 knowing no English, and endured a lot of intrigue navigating
    his local immigrant community in Chicago. He struggled with unions, which involved
    a lot of physical violence and intimidation back in the 50's through the 70's.
    And there he was, on the verge of retirement, with children who were well-adjusted,
    successful, with kids of their own he could enjoy. So it was a wonderful story
    about a guy taking all sorts of chances, enduring daily struggles, and ending
    up with a really happy ending. What made it so poignant was it was so real. He
    didn't do anything uniquely difficult, or create anything uniquely valuable, but
    his day-to-day integrity and hard work paid off in a way much greater than any
    financial lottery.

  zh: 有好几次我听过一位年长者讲述他们的人生故事，让我感到非常惊讶。我的老楼房监工告诉我，他 19 岁时来到美国，一句英语都不懂，艰难地在芝加哥的当地移民社区中生存。他在
    50 年代至 70 年代与工会作斗争，那时的工会活动涉及到很多身体上的暴力和恐吓。当他快要退休时，他的孩子们生活得很好，事业有成，并且有了自己的孩子，他可以享受到这一切。所以，这是一个关于一个人冒着各种险，经受日常挣扎，并最终获得了真正幸福结局的故事。它之所以如此感人，是因为它是如此真实。他没有做任何独特困难的事情，也没有创造任何独特有价值的东西，但是他的日常诚实和努力工作以一种远远超过任何金钱彩票的方式得到了回报。
