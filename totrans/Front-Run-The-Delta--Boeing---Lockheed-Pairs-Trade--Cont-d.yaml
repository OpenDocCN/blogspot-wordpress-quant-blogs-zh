    Q3 2006\. EPS beat the Street's estimates of $1.24, coming in at $1.44, a $0.55
    gain over Q3 06\. Revenue for the quarter grew to $16.52B, a 12% increase over
    Q3 2006\. Showed conservative 2007 guidance of $5.05 - 5.15 EPS, vs. the Street's
    estimates of $5.06\. Lowered 2008 guidance slightly due to previously disclosed
    delays in delivery.

    high of $106 down to $93/sh. LMT, on the other hand, continued in its trend up
    until 12 Oct, when it was trading around $111, when it began a steady fall over
    the next week, falling as low as mid-$103.

- en: Support began to develop 10 Oct. when the volume increased significantly. Again,
    the smart money noticed a slight correction in Boeing, a solid, global firm, and
    saw a value play, so they began buying up. Coupled with the mutual funds, the
    Arbs began going long BA and shorting LMT, causing a convergence play.

    likely stay in a range of $107-111 until BA gains some ground.
