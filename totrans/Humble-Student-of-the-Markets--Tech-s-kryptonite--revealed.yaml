    owns American-based property, plant and equipment – the sort of assets that make
    up the “business infrastructure” of our country – with a GAAP valuation exceeding
    the amount owned by any other U.S. company. Berkshire’s depreciated cost of these
    domestic “fixed assets” is $154 billion. Next in line on this list is AT&T, with
    property, plant and equipment of $127 billion.'

    minimal assets to conduct high-margin businesses – and offer goods or services
    that will expand their sales volume with only minor needs for additional capital.

    small and, at best, grow slowly.

    have been the main beneficiaries of the asset-light platform business model. On
    a relative basis, technology forward P/E ratios are stretched relative to the
    S&P 500.
