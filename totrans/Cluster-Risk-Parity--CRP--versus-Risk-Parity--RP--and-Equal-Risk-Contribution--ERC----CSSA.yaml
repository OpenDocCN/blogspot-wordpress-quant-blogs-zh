- en: '[Cluster Risk Parity](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2013/01/03/cluster-risk-parity/
    "Cluster Risk Parity") (*Varadi, Kapler, 2012*) is a method to improve upon the
    deficiencies of [Risk Parity and Equal Risk Contribution](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2012/07/19/not-equal-a-comparison-of-risk-parity-and-equal-risk-contribution/
    "Not Equal: A Comparison of “Risk Parity” and “Equal Risk Contribution”"): a)
    the need for manual universe selection  (see [All-Weather and Permanent Portfolio](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2012/11/07/the-all-weather-portfolio-derivation/
    "The “All-Weather” Portfolio Derivation")) and b) imbalanced risk exposure as
    a function of the universe selected. To highlight the latter issue it is worthwhile
    to take a look at an example where we use only the S&P500 (SPY) and Treasury Bond
    (TLT) time series to create universes for portfolio creation. This example is
    not that extreme because it is conventional to include multiple ETFs or mutual
    funds that represent multiple sectors or countries that are included along with
    multiple bond ETFs/funds.  This example below using data over the past year is
    very important:'

- en: The point of this analysis is that the number or composition of bond versus
    equity will dramatically affect the risk contribution of the portfolio from each
    category with conventional risk parity methods.  In the example above, even when
    considering only the 5 asset case, the distortion in risk is significant- more
    than 100% of risk is coming from equities for risk parity, while a whopping 80%
     of risk is coming from equities for ERC. In contrast, Cluster Risk Parity (CRP)
    is balanced regardless of the number or composition of the universe. This helps
    to ensure consistency in risk management and performance and also  ensure that
    portfolio rebalancing has the desired impact. The use of manual compilation/categorization
    into say “equity” or “bond” is not sufficient to avoid this problem because there
    are times when there is crossover (like high yield) and even significant differences
    within each category when correlations are low. Using CRP is the simplest way
    to avoid these issues without having to run a lot of ad hoc analysis and having
    to make continual adjustments.
