- en: Excellent readership and thoughtful comments on the original [How to Learn Algorithmic
    Trading](https://quantivity.wordpress.com/2010/01/10/how-to-learn-algorithmic-trading/)
    have motivated two follow-up posts on learning quantitative / algorithmic trading
    (while retrospectively revising the original to improve consistency). This Part
    focuses on the cross-discipline foundations of financial mathematics, whose knowledge
    is generally assumed by practitioners and financial modeling literature. The subsequent,
    Part 3, focuses on [modern financial modeling and analysis](https://quantivity.wordpress.com/2010/01/12/how-to-learn-algorithmic-trading-part-3/).

    to delve into seminal literature in selected trading disciplines, such as suggested
    by [etrading](http://etrading.wordpress.com/2010/01/11/quantivity-on-learning-algo/)
    on the [Penn-Lehman Automated Trading Project](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/projects/plat.html).

    As with the original post, the following is intended to inform *retail quantitative
    trading with a bias to equity, exchange-traded derivatives, and FX*.
