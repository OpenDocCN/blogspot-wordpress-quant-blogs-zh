    historically been the most bearish week of the year. 2011 didn't do anything to
    make the stats look any more bullish.  Below is an updated chart showing the persistently
    poor performance since 1961.

    51 years.  There was a stretch in the late 80’s where there was a series of mild
    up years.  Since 1990 it has been pretty much all downhill.
