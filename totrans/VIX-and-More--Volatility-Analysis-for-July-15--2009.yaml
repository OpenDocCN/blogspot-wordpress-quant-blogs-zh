- en: The intraday tick for tick positive correlation between the VIX and the SPX
    was as strong as I have ever seen. Most of the time the VIX and the SPX move in
    opposite directions. Today it was almost as if someone has inverted the gravitational
    forces acting upon these two indices. (For more on the correlation between the
    VIX and the SPX, check out the posts with the [SPX-VIX correlation](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SPX-VIX%20correlation)
    label.)

    time ever that both indices moved more than 2.8% in the same direction on the
    same day.

    check out my June 1^(st) post, [Eerie Déjà vu as VIX and SPX Both Jump More Than
    2.5%](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/06/eerie-deja-vu-as-vix-and-spx-both-jump.html)

- en: When both the VIX and SPX are up on the same day, this is historically bearish,
    generally conveying an edge of 0.25% or to the bears for 3-5 days. This edge begins
    to diminish substantially after about a month or so.

    0.80 when Intel ([INTC](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/INTC)) earnings
    were announced after hours yesterday. So with the SPX essentially frozen, there
    was a 0.80 offset going into the day from the 15 minute [twilight zone](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/twilight%20zone)
    while trading that took place yesterday from 4:00 to 4:15 p.m. ET. If we were
    to back out the 0.80 after hours VIX drop, then the VIX would have finished approximately
    flat today – still an interesting development, but a lot less noteworthy.

    low, with so many very important volatility events right around the corner, including
    a critical earnings reporting season, a flood of highly anticipated economic data
    and options expiration.
