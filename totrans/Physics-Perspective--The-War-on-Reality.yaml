    of private security and intelligence firms that are not only gathering information
    on ordinary people, but actively creating and spreading disinformation (otherwise
    known as "lies") to discredit opponents of their corporate clients. They''re information
    mercenaries who are essentially shaping reality as we see it -- and not with benign
    motives, you can be sure. Ludlow:'

    play in our society, it is worth examining information that has been revealed
    by some significant hacks in the past few years of previously secret data.

    group best known as LulzSec  (at the time the group was called Internet Feds),
    which targeted the private intelligence firm HBGary Federal.  That hack yielded
    75,000 e-mails.  It revealed, for example, that Bank of America approached the
    Department of Justice over concerns about information that WikiLeaks had about
    it.  The Department of Justice in turn referred Bank of America to the lobbying
    firm Hunton and Willliams, which in turn connected the bank with a group of information
    security firms collectively known as Team Themis.

    firms Palantir Technologies, Berico Technologies and Endgame Systems) was effectively
    brought in to find a way to undermine the credibility of WikiLeaks and the journalist
    Glenn Greenwald (who recently broke the story of Edward Snowden’s leak of the
    N.S.A.’s Prism program),  because of Greenwald’s support for WikiLeaks. Specifically,
    the plan called for actions to “sabotage or discredit the opposing organization”
    including a plan to submit fake documents and then call out the error. As for
    Greenwald, it was argued that he would cave “if pushed” because he would “choose
    professional preservation over cause.” That evidently wasn’t the case.

    the credibility of one of its critics, a group called Chamber Watch. The proposal
    called for first creating a “false document, perhaps highlighting periodical financial
    information,” giving it to a progressive group opposing the Chamber, and then
    subsequently exposing the document as a fake to “prove that U.S. Chamber Watch
    cannot be trusted with information and/or tell the truth.” (A photocopy of the
    proposal can be found [here.](http://images2.americanprogress.org/ThinkProgress/ProposalForTheChamber.pdf))

    Chamber Watch.  They would “create two fake insider personas, using one as leverage
    to discredit the other while confirming the legitimacy of the second.” The hack
    also revealed evidence that Team Themis was developing a “[persona management](http://boingboing.net/2011/02/18/hbgarys-high-volume.html)”
    system — a program, developed at the specific request of the United States Air
    Force, that allowed one user to control multiple online identities (“sock puppets”)
    for commenting in social media spaces, thus giving the appearance of grass roots
    support.  The contract was eventually awarded to another private intelligence
    firm.

    real, and resembles in some ways the employment of “Psyops” (psychological operations),
    which as most students of recent American history know, have been part of the
    nation’s military strategy for decades. The military’s “Unconventional Warfare
    Training Manual” defines Psyops as “planned operations to convey selected information
    and indicators to foreign audiences to influence their emotions, motives, objective
    reasoning, and ultimately the behavior of foreign governments, organizations,
    groups, and individuals.” In other words, it is sometimes more effective to deceive
    a population into a false reality than it is to impose its will with force or
    conventional weapons.  Of course this could also apply to one’s own population
    if you chose to view it as an “enemy” whose “motives, reasoning, and behavior”
    needed to be controlled.

    with the capabilities and the incentive to conduct them, and in the case of private
    intelligence contractors, there are both incentives (billions of dollars in contracts)
    and capabilities.

    named Jeremy Hammond successfully hacked into another private intelligence firm
    — Strategic Forcasting Inc., or Stratfor), and released approximately five million
    e-mails. This hack provided a remarkable insight into how the private security
    and intelligence companies view themselves vis a vis government security agencies
    like the C.I.A. In a 2004 [e-mail](http://search.wikileaks.org/gifiles/?viewemailid=3438302)
    to Stratfor employees, the firm’s founder and chairman George Friedman was downright
    dismissive of the C.I.A.’s capabilities relative to their own:  “Everyone in Langley
    [the C.I.A.] knows that we do things they have never been able to do with a small
    fraction of their resources. They have always asked how we did it. We can now
    show them and maybe they can learn.”

    to monitor protestors in Occupy Austin as well as Occupy’s relation to the environmental

    including a group called Bophal Medical Appeal. But the targets also included
    The Yes Men, a satirical group that had humiliated Dow Chemical with a fake news
    conference announcing reparations for the victims.  Stratfor regularly copied
    several Dow officers on the minutia of activities by the two members of the Yes
    Men.One intriguing [e-mail](http://rt.com/usa/stratfor-fbi-investigation-peta-093/)
    revealed [that the Coca-Cola company was asking Stratfor for intelligence on PETA](http://rt.com/usa/stratfor-fbi-investigation-peta-093/)
    (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) with Stratfor vice president for
    Intelligence claiming that “The F.B.I. has a classified investigation on PETA
    operatives. I’ll see what I can uncover.” From this one could get the impression
    that the F.B.I. was in effect working as a private detective Stratfor and its

    numerous [media companies on its payroll](http://www.greenleft.org.au/node/50168).
    While one motivation for the partnerships was presumably to have sources of intelligence,
    Stratfor worked hard to have soap boxes from which to project its interests. In
    one 2007 e-mail, it seemed that [Stratfor was close to securing a regular show
    on NPR](http://search.wikileaks.org/gifiles/?viewemailid=1249101): “[the producer]

    if he could successfully defend himself against the charges he was facing, the
    Department of Justice promised him that he would face the same charges in [eight
    different districts](http://freejeremy.net/press-release/statement-from-jeremy-regarding-his-plea/)
    and he would be shipped to all of them in turn.  He would become a defendant for
    life.  He had no choice but to plea to a deal in which he may be sentenced to
    10 years in prison.  But even as he made the plea [he issued a statement](http://freejeremy.net/press-release/statement-from-jeremy-regarding-his-plea/),
    saying “I did this because I believe people have a right to know what governments
    and corporations are doing behind closed doors. I did what I believe is right.”

    agree that what he did was right. In their view, the private intelligence industry
    is effectively engaged in Psyops against the American public., engaging in “planned
    operations to convey selected information to [us] to influence [our] emotions,
    motives, objective reasoning and, ultimately, [our] behavior”? Or as the philosopher
    might put it, they are engaged in epistemic warfare.
