    solution is to itemize everything that can go wrong, but in doing so it is as

    not useful, because after a short while decision makers get used to ignoring these
    risks. I remember the first time I bought a house, and didn't know what to look
    for in the inspection. I hired someone to do this for me and for a couple hundred
    bucks I got a list of over 100 items that were not prioritized, which I found
    totally unhelpful, but I had to pay him (he obviously did work).

    1'', meaning they violated NASA''s redundancy criterion: if they failed the shuttle
    would be lost. In the first 25 flights up through its last, 131 technical flows
    proved serious enough to warrant NASA''s designation of ''launch constraint.''
    Of these, 66 were resolved after 1 flight, the rest, like the O-ring joint that
    ultimately failed, overridden repeatedly. If there are that many high level risks
    going off, that''s what happens.'

    damage: probability times cost. Many times these probabilities are so small, they
    are rather qualitative, but such is risk. Nonetheless, Detroit reminds us that
    merely saying anything or everything can go wrong, while true, is quite useless
    and not profound. Enumerating a long list of disparate things that may happen,
    without any probabilities, may work for Nouriel Roubini, but he''s a charlatan:'

    endlessly enumerate risks many times in large corporations, and they are highly
    correlated with people who either are too afraid to make a mistake, or profoundly
    do not understand their job.
