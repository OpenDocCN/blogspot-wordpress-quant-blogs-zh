    being in the bottom of the ninth inning, with the bulls trailing by two runs,
    with two outs and one man on base. The bulls still have a chance to tie the game
    but they face an uphill battle.

    in a downtrend. I would like to see a cyclically sensitive metal such as copper
    rally to break the upper band of the downtrend line before I feel comfortable
    that the threat of a deflationary panic has subsided.

    market tells the same story. CYC broke down out of a relative uptrend in mid-May
    and is now testing the upper band of a relative downtrend line. I would like to
    see CYC/SPX line to decisively break out of its relative downtrend line as a signal
    that the US economy is not moving into double-dip territory.

    level on the SPX. While the existence of the downtrend suggests that the bears
    have the slight upper hand, technicians cannot discern a direction until the pattern
    is resolved (either by upside breakout or by support violation).

    accurately foreshadowing seven recessions — with a three month lag. Keep your
    eye on the -10 threshold, for at that level, the economy has gone into recession
    … only 100% of the time (42 years of data).'
