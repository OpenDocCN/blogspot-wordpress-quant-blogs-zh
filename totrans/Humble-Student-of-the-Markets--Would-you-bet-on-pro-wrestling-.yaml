    at all—it’s all about feelings. The major plot points of the crisis largely turned
    on emotion: Dick Fuld was too egotistical to sell Lehman Brothers when he had
    the chance, so his pride drove it into the ground; Bear Stearns hedge-fund managers
    lost huge sums of money on subprime mortgages despite the fact that they suspected
    the worst (“I’m fearful of these markets,” Ralph Cioffi e-mailed a colleague back
    in 2007); Merrill Lynch was the “fat kid,” as the investor Steve Eisman has put
    it, so desperate to be like Goldman Sachs that it barreled into every dumb investment
    imaginable and had to be bailed out by Bank of America. Almost every single bank
    chief doubled down on mortgage junk at exactly the wrong moment. Emotions led
    otherwise intelligent men—because, let’s face it, all of them were men—to make
    terrible decisions.'

    Wall Street’s volatility is really driven by our body chemistry. It’s the chemicals
    pulsing through traders’ veins that propel them to place insane bets and enable
    bank executives to make risky decisions—and those same chemicals tend to have
    the same effect on everyone, turning them into a herd of overheated animals. And
    because the vast majority of these traders and finance executives are men, the
    most important chemical in question is testosterone.
