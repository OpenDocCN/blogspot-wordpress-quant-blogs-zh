## Eventual Consistency

Interesting read from Microsoft [Research](http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=189249), “Understanding Eventual Consistency”.  “Geo-Replication in Large Scale Cloud Computing Applications” may also be worth a [read](http://www.gsd.inesc-id.pt/~ler/reports/sergioalmeidaea.pdf) if you are interested in this subject of geo-replication.
