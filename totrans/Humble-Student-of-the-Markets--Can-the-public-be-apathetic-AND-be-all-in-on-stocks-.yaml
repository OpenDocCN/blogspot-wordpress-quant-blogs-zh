    they remain jittery and are quick to bail whenever risk aversion rises. That`s
    why we have seen frequent short but shallow pullbacks marked by spikes in fear.

    effect, both assertions are true. The average American remains apathetic and unaware
    of the bull market while fully invested. That`s because surveys like Gallup are
    equal weighted, that is to say they survey all Americans, while surveys like the
    AAII Asset Allocation Survey is more tilted towards a population who matter -
    those with money.

    the Percent of families with stock holdings by income groupings. For the period
    from 2007 to 2013, only the top 10% of households saw holdings rise, while all
    other groups saw their holdings fall. ***Since outfits like AAII measure overall
    equity allocations and it's the 10% that have most of the stock holdings, it is
    no surprise that we see weighted equity holdings rise.***

    chart below shows the median value of stock holdings for households that reported
    non-zero holdings by income group. First of all, note the disparity in the magnitude
    of holdings. The value of the holdings of the top 10% group dwarves all other
    groups, including the next 10% by income.

    go down the income group, here is the same data in table form. From 2007 to 2013,
    only the top decile and the second quartile of households that reported stock
    holdings saw their median portfolio value increase. Given the pattern shown by
    the other charts and tables, the gain by the second quartile is likely a statistical
    anomaly.
