    these days you will be overwhelmed by the linkage of articles to blockchain.  At
    the high level, you probably want to assess if Blockchain is a disruptive technology
    in your space – if you have no idea what/how blockchain can impact you, then its
    time to cut to the chase fast, as there is the distinct possibility that the ground
    under you could change, more than likely forced by disruptive startup’s.

    of waiting for change to be forced on them.  There have been numerous comments
    in the press recently from bank employees with regards to the disruptive change
    the blockchain will bring to finance.  Its inevitable that the banks will need
    to form a consortium to tackle the challenges to revenue that blockchain could
    bring. As discussed elsewhere, collateral, post trade, trading and more is being
    investigated by banks individually, at cost.  A consortium would allow banks to
    pool their knowledge and resources at an individual lower cost post to decide
    their collectively future in the world of blockchain, before their lunch is eaten
    by the startup culture.
