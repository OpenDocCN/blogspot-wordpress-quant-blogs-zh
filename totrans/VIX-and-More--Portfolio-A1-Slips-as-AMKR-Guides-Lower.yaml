    which fueled much of the gains in Portfolio A1 from February through June, [guided
    third quarter revenues and earnings](http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/070801/amkor_outlook.html?.v=1)
    below analyst expectations on Tuesday, triggering a 21% loss in the stock for
    the week.  Now down over 37% from the June high, AMKR’s slide has turned this
    former big gainer into a 12% loser for the portfolio and has contributed heavily
    to the portfolio’s decline in the past five weeks.'

    any of my discretionary trading systems, the stock Portfolio A1 ranker has not
    yet seen fit to drop AMKR [Edit: My error here. AMKR was indeed sold; please see
    [8/12/07 portfolio update](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/08/portfolio-a1-losing-altitude-quickly.html)

    in holdings during the week, this means the stock has a reprieve for at least
    another five trading days.'

    past week as well and now trails the benchmark S&P 500 index by 6.1%, the largest
    performance gap to date.

- en: This is a highly concentrated portfolio of just five stocks, with an average
    beta that hovers in the 2.0 range, so large drawdowns always loom as a possibility.  If
    the broader markets fail to rebound in the next week or two, it will be interesting
    to see how the stock ranking system culls some of the losers and where it chooses
    to reallocate capital.  In the meantime, as indicated by the system’s rules, this
    portfolio will continue to remain on autopilot during the trading week.
