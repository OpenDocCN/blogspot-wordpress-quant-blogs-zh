# Timely Portfolio: Wealth and Skill | A Talk to Students

I enjoyed talking to University of Alabama students this morning about wealth, skill, and luck.  I tried to synthesize a whole lot of research into something meaningful.  Of course, it would not have been possible without [rCharts](http://rcharts.io) + [Slidify](http://slidify.github.io).  Thanks Ramnath. Thanks to my good friend Dr. Underwood for the invitation. Click [here](http://timelyportfolio.github.io/talks/2014-04-15_UofA) or on the screenshot below for the show.
