- en: There has been a lot of speculation about which corner of the economy is likely
    to implode next and start to write the next chapter in the current financial crisis.
    [Credit card](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/credit%20cards) debt
    and [commercial real estate](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/commercial%20real%20estate)
    are two of the most frequently cited potential culprits, but lately Eastern European
    banks have been under great stress, while [credit default swaps](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/credit%20default%20swaps)
    for Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary have been on the rise.

    Jump in the VIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/04/todays-jump-in-vix.html)
    on Monday evening. From the various public and private comments, it is clear that
    there is a strong contingent of veteran investors who anticipate not only that
    the next shoe will drop soon, but that the fallout will be at least as bad as
    what we experienced during the October-November peak of the crisis.

    above 60 in the near future, nor do I even see a VIX above 50 as a likely scenario.

- en: Last Friday, the SPX had its highest close since the 666.79 “[devil’s bottom](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/devil%27s%20bottom)”
    low of March 6^(th). From Friday’s 842.50 close to Tuesday’s close of 815.55,
    the SPX fell 3.2%. During this same period, the cash VIX gained just 1.7%, moving
    up from 39.70 to 40.39\. In the chart below, however, one can see that even thought
    the cash VIX rose, the volatility index for SPX options in April, May, June, July
    and September actually fell, with volatility for the April expiration showing
    a 12.5% drop in the VIX, May volatility dropping 4% and the June through September
    strikes show a volatility decrease on the order of 0.9%-1.6%. In other words,
    expectations for volatility – and presumably fear and uncertainty – for the balance
    of the year continue to point to improvement.

    to measure what they believe is an appropriate level of fear. This group, whose
    concern I can sympathize with from time to time, will undoubtedly see an indifferent
    VIX as a reason to be even more concerned about the future.

    points to increasing investor confidence in the markets and a decreasing concern
    about the possibility of gravity commingling ominously with oversized footwear.
