# Humble Student of the Markets: A short term warning for US Dollar bears and commodity bulls

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2008/03/short-term-warning-for-us-dollar-bears.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2008/03/short-term-warning-for-us-dollar-bears.html#0001-01-01)

As the cacophony of voices calling for doom for the US Dollar (and conversely a rise in commodity prices) come to a crescendo (example

) and gold tops $1,000/oz. and oil tops $110/bbl, I would like to

[reiterate](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2008/02/channeling-my-inner-contrarian.html)

my word of short term warning for the Dollar bears and commodity bulls. Signs of a speculative blow-off are everywhere.

Sentiment is getting a little extreme for this trade to continue too much further in the short term. Recently Bob Moriarty of 321gold.com

[sounded a note of caution](http://www.321gold.com/editorials/moriarty/moriarty030708.html)

(italics are mine):

> Nothing goes straight up and nothing goes straight down. As edifying as it is to see silver and gold go up almost every day, now and again all markets take a breather.
> 
> ***I run a gold site and it's considered heresy to suggest commodities correct but they do.*** Even the lowly dollar goes in the opposite direction on occasions.

Ten days later, he

[hedged](http://www.321gold.com/editorials/moriarty/moriarty031708.html)

his earlier comment and conceded the bullish case for gold based on an apocalyptic scenario for the US economy and Dollar:

> It's a time for caution. We SHOULD have a violent correction in gold and silver and the dollar based on emotion and government intervention but we could see $3,000 gold in a week or the start of a living nightmare brought to you by the Gang of Fools in Washington. No one knows.

To me, that was the

***first***

sign of a speculative blow-off in the USD and commodities. The

***second***

sign: Both Energy and Gold stocks are at or near the top of their relative uptrend channels against the S&P 500\. Can they go higher? Yes. However, the relative downside risk in the near term appears to outweigh the upside rewards.

The

***third***

sign of excessive bullishness: The Commitment of Traders chart from

[CFTC data](http://www.cftc.gov/marketreports/commitmentsoftraders/index.htm)

of large speculators in gold show that they are in a crowded long position, which is contrarian bearish:

My inner trader says that we are in the final stages of a speculative blow-off in commodities and has the potential to correct violently. My inner investor agrees with the consensus view, however, that we are in a long multi-year decline of the US Dollar and multi-year rise for commodities.
