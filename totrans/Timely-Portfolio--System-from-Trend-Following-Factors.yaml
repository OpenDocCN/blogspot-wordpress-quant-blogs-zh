- en: As I thought more about [Trend Following Factors from Hsieh and Fung](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2012/05/trend-following-factors-from-hsieh-and.html),
    I thought that the trend following factors might indicate a state/regime for the
    equity markets that could potentially offer momentum-style timing signals for
    a system on the S&P 500.  Now, **THIS ABSOLUTELY SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED INVESTMENT
    ADVICE,** especially since the factor data is very lagged and the testing is nowhere
    near comprehensive enough.  I will however try to replicate the factor methodology
    to get a more real-time indicator extended to any index in another post. What
    is most interesting to me is that this is ex-ante intuitive and the signal is
    just basic statistics.
