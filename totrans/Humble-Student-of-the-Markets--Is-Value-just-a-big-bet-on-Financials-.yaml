    by the relative performance of Financials.

- en: The chart below shows the relative weights of the Value and Growth indices in
    the large cap (Russell 1000 Value and Growth), mid cap (Russell Mid-cap Value
    and Growth) and small cap (Russell 2000 Value and Growth) indices. As you can
    see, the Value indices have consistent large overweight in Financials across all
    market cap bands when compared to the Growth indices. By contrast, the Growth
    indices are overweight Health Care or Technology, depending on when it’s a large
    cap (Technology) or small cap (Health Care) index.

- en: Given the recent problems that the Financials have had, it’s not surprising
    that Value has become tilted towards the sector. In this environment, relative
    returns are becoming dominated by one big bet on Financials.
