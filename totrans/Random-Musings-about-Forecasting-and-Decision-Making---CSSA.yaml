    science (which it is) but rather that forecasters share some remarkably primitive
    biases. Whether you look at purely quantitative forecasts or “expert/guru” forecasts,
    they have one thing in common: ***they rarely change their opinions or methods
    in light of new information***. In fact, what I have noticed is that the smarter
    the person is and the more information they seem to possess, the less likely they
    are to change their mind.Undoubtedly this is why many genuinely intelligent and
    knowledgeable experts have blown up large funds or personal trading accounts.
    Ask a person to give you an opinion on where a market is going, and then notice
    what happens when the market goes dramatically the other way along with news announcements
    that seem to conflict with their thesis.  Most of the time this person will tell
    you that they have not changed their mind, and in fact that it is an even better
    price to buy (or short). Models or systems suffer from the same problem–they typically
    do not adjust as conditions or regimes change, nor do they observe their own profitability
    as a cue. Most economists or technical traders build a framework that assumes
    continuity and self-similarity of the environment in which a forecast was made
    in the past.'

    you that I learned the hard way many times that the market was more often right
    than wrong. It was uncanny how well future fundamentals were sometimes “forecasted”
    by price. At the time, I had no knowledge of technical analysis and lacked the
    intellectual framework to synthesize a superior decision-making method. Of course,
    I would ride that “under-valued” stock with a price to book ratio less than 1
    all the way to being a penny stock before I gave up. I also sold many of my winners
    far too early because their P/E indicated they were no longer undervalued. Some
    of these stocks went on to go up 400% or more, while I was content to make 25%
    profit.  I did the exact opposite with overvalued stocks or stocks with crappy
    fundamentals. I was heavily short Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as well as General
    Motors in early 2007! Of course,  I got my clock cleaned and got  margin-calls
    long before they plunged almost to zero. This was a case of being right, but too
    early to fight the sentiment of the crowd.

    risk-management. But this still does not address how to create an intellectual
    framework to make superior decisions or forecasts. It finally dawned on me one
    day that good forecasting (or decision-making) was a dynamic process involving
    feedback. In fact, the actual information used to make the initial decisions need
    not be complex as long as you are willing to adjust after the fact. This is especially
    true the less money you have at risk at the outset. I learned this principle while
    playing cards— you can see a lot of hands with a small investment as long as you
    are willing to fold many times when the situation becomes unfavorable, and stick
    around only when the situation shows promise as more cards are revealed. In other
    words, your starting hand criteria can be somewhat loose and include hands that
    do not have a strong edge provided that you adjust properly to new information
    as the hand progresses. This sounds somewhat elementary, but revolutionary based
    on how most experts and average traders/investors make decisions. It means that
    discretionary traders should pay attention strongly to evidence that invalidates
    their initial hypothesis and be willing to even reverse their position entirely.
    It also means that traders should risk little up front, and increase positions
    as subsequent information confirms their hypothesis.In this manner, you win a
    lot more when you are right then when you are wrong.

    what is critically absent is the whole rationale for making the trade in the first
    place! Trend-followers win for many reasons, but primarily because certain fundamental
    events and crowd psychology develop and cause prices to move to extremes in a
    feedback loop that is gradual enough to create a discernible trend. The best combination
    is to take a fundamental hypothesis about risk and reward and use the trend and
    risk-management techniques to capitalize on it. This way, you have some sense
    of risk versus reward in advance that may create a situation with superior payoffs
    to just the standard edge of a conventional trend entry. Of course there are many
    ways to improve upon this simple framework–but at least it is a good start. Quantitative
    forecasting models or systems should take the same tact to create superior performance.
    More interestingly, a forecasting model need not be highly predictive at all by
    itself— as long as the errors that it makes are systematic and predictable, it
    can be actually highly useful. This is where many experts miss the boat– a low
    model r-squared can appear useless, but actually be far more valuable than a high
    r-squared model once the adjustment is made to model the sources of error.
