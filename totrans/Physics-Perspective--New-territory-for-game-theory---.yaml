    it appears to make an important demonstration of how, when thinking about human
    behavior in strategic games, fixed point or mixed strategy Nash equilibria can
    be far too restrictive and misleading, ruling out much more complex dynamics,
    which in reality can occur even for rational people playing simple games:'

    in social and economic systems. These claims emerge from the analysis of individually
    simple agents whose collective behavior is surprisingly complicated. However,
    economists have argued that iterated reasoning–what you think I think you think–will
    suppress complex dynamics by stabilizing or accelerating convergence to Nash equilibrium.
    We report stable and efficient periodic behavior in human groups playing the Mod
    Game, a multi-player game similar to Rock-Paper-Scissors. The game rewards subjects
    for thinking exactly one step ahead of others in their group. Groups that play
    this game exhibit cycles that are inconsistent with any fixed-point solution concept.
    These cycles are driven by a “hopping” behavior that is consistent with other
    accounts of iterated reasoning: agents are constrained to about two steps of iterated
    reasoning and learn an additional one-half step with each session. If higher-order
    reasoning can be complicit in complex emergent dynamics, then cyclic and chaotic
    patterns may be endogenous features of real-world social and economic systems.'

- en: Cycles in the belief space of learning agents have been predicted for many years,
    particularly in games with intransitive dominance relations, like Matching Pennies
    and Rock-Paper-Scissors, but experimentalists have only recently started looking
    to these dynamics for experimental predictions. This work should function to caution
    experimentalists of the dangers of treating dynamics as ephemeral deviations from
    a static solution concept. Periodic behavior in the Mod Game, which is stable
    and efficient, challenges the preconception that coordination mechanisms must
    converge on equilibria or other fixed-point solution concepts to be promising
    for social applications. This behavior also reveals that iterated reasoning and
    stable high-dimensional dynamics can coexist, challenging recent models whose
    implementation of sophisticated reasoning implies convergence to a fixed point

    Applied to real complex social systems, this work gives credence to recent predictions
    of chaos in financial market game dynamics [[8]](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0056416#pone.0056416-Galla1).
    Applied to game learning, our support for cyclic regimes vindicates the general
    presence of complex attractors, and should help motivate their adoption into the
    game theorist’s canon of solution concepts
