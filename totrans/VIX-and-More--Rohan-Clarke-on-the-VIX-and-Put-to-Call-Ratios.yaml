    a Fistful of Euros](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/11/edward-hugh-and-fistful-of-euros.html)
    and [Market Psych Offers Language-Based Fear Index](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/12/market-psych-offers-language-based-fear.html),
    I thought it might be a good time to highlight the work of another blogger who
    I believe deserves a wider audience and whose content nicely complements what
    readers can find here.

    and also carries the tag line, “An investor’s diary of economic data, corporate
    earnings and market sentiment.” While Clarke is based in Australia, his posts
    betray a broad range of geographical and intellectual interests. His latest missive,
    from earlier today, [Betting on Zero](http://www.datadiary.com.au/2010/12/15/betting-on-zero/),
    tackles inexpensive portfolio hedges, the VIX and [put to call](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/put%20to%20call)
    ratios.

    out [billy blog](http://bilbo.economicoutlook.net/blog/), where I can guarantee
    that Bill Mitchell’s take on the global economy and economic issues in Australia
    will give you something to think about, whether you agree with his perspective
    or not.
