    The VXX trades a shload, about 30MM shares per day. This means, we now have options
    on the VIX. These aren't options on options, but options on implied vols of options
    on options (ack!). Looking at the implied volatilities by strike, and comparing
    them to the implieds on the SPY, we see they are quite different little beasts.
