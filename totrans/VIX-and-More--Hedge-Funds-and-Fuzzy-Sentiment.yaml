    does a nice job of summarizing two different points of view on the [impact of
    hedge fund activity on market sentiment indicators](http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2007/05/are_hedge_funds.html),
    a category which includes the VIX, put to call ratios, and many of the other concepts
    I kick around here.'

- en: In his analysis, Ritholtz quotes John Bollinger in the [Wall Street Journal](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118048148598217838.html)
    as saying that when it comes to short interest, “Hedge fund activity has destroyed
    the usefulness of the numbers.”  While I am inclined to agree with Bollinger with
    respect to short interest figures, I am not at all willing to take the extra step
    and offer a sweeping indictment of the VIX, put to call numbers, and other sentiment
    data.  I am more than a little concerned about the increased role of hedge funds,
    ETFs and other factors that may call into question the value of making comparisons
    with historical data, but this is the reason that I often favor relative measures
    over absolute ones and ratios to stand-alone numbers.

    sentiment data can be enough information to give you the edge you need in your
    trading.
