- en: There are many different types of market states–the longer term that are more
    aptly called “regimes”, and the short-term shifts in the market  that I call short-term
    “waves.”  Different types of waves can exist within the context of a regime. For
    example, we can have a brief wave of volatility bursts or a wave of “chop” within
    the context of a regime that is best described as an up trend with low volatility.
    Waves can be very brief–lasting from a few days to a week or more, while regimes
    often last a month and can last up to a full year. What I find interesting is
    that market states are always in the state of flux–one can even measure the likelihood
    of a regime or wave ending on the basis of historical precedent. This type of
    methodology is a part of what I like to call “state-based classification”, and
    the goal is to partition strategies according to their expected performance in
    both waves and regimes. Accurate state-based classification is extremely valuable,
    because if we know how a particular type of strategy behaves in a given market
    state we can “anticipate” how to adjust our portfolio allocation or position size.
    For example, it is well-known and logical to state that mean-reversion performs
    well during conditions of high volatility. In this case, if we can predict volatility,
    we can predict when to allocate more or less to a mean-reversion strategy.

  zh: 市场状态有很多不同类型——较长周期的更准确地称为“制度”，以及市场短期波动，我称之为短期“波浪”。在制度背景下可以存在不同类型的波浪。例如，我们可以在最佳描述为低波动性上升趋势的制度背景下有一个短暂的波动性爆发波浪或一个“震荡”波浪。波浪可能非常短暂——持续几天到一周多，而制度通常持续一个月，可以持续整整一年。我发现有趣的是，市场状态总是处于流动状态——甚至可以根据历史先例测量一个制度或波浪结束的可能性。这种方法是我喜欢称之为“基于状态的分类”的一部分，目标是根据策略在波浪和制度中的预期表现进行分区。准确的基于状态的分类非常有价值，因为如果我们知道某种特定策略在给定市场状态下的行为，我们可以“预测”如何调整我们的投资组合分配或头寸大小。例如，众所周知且合乎逻辑的说法是，在高度波动的条件下，均值回归表现良好。在这种情况下，如果我们能预测波动性，我们就可以预测何时对均值回归策略进行更多或更少的分配。
- en: 'Unlike conventional “swarm” or rotational strategies for adaptation–which reacts
    rather than anticipates—a clear sense of how to adjust for market states permits
    smoother transitions. You trade off one form of “error” for another: 1) “**state
    adjustment error**“:  Swarm adaptation will be pushed towards what is working
    well with a fair degree of lag, and thus will adjust to “waves” incorrectly since
    they are transient. however, it should be able to adjust to regimes correctly
    as long as they persist for longer than one month. 2)”**strategy classification
    error**“: in contrast “state-based classification” faces the risk of incorrectly
    identifying the strategies most likely to perform well during a given wave or
    regime. I like to call this “strategy classification error” since you are making
    a judgement based on historical performance in advance and the actual strategy
    may not perform according to expectations during a given regime. This type of
    error is unlikely to be made by swarm/momentum type strategies since they will
    move towards what is actually working.'

  zh: 与传统的“群体”或旋转适应策略不同——后者是反应性的而非预测性的——对如何调整市场状态有一个清晰的认识可以使过渡更加平稳。你用一种类型的“错误”换取另一种：1)“**状态调整错误**”：群体适应将被推动向表现良好的状态，但存在一定程度的滞后，因此会错误地调整到“波浪”，因为它们是短暂的。然而，只要持续时间超过一个月，它应该能够正确地调整到制度。2)“**策略分类错误**”：相比之下，“基于状态的分类”面临风险，可能会错误地识别在给定波浪或制度中最可能表现良好的策略。我更喜欢称其为“策略分类错误”，因为你基于历史表现预先做出判断，而实际策略可能不会按照预期在给定制度期间表现。这种错误不太可能由群体/动量型策略作出，因为它们将朝着实际有效的内容移动。
- en: Again, it is logical to combine both procedures to enhance results. Using a
    swarm or relative-strength algorithm to confirm expected strategy performance
    within a given regime (or wave) is the penultimate form of “hypothesis testing.”
    You build a theory based on historical testing of a given strategy in a given
    state, and then once that state is confirmed to be present, you observe to see
    if the strategy is performing according to expectations in “reality.” Using anticipatory
    state-based strategies take this to the next dimension where you are predicting
    what states are most likely to occur and then looking to get earlier evidence
    from strategy performance prior to confirmation that you are in a given regime/wave.
    You can even bet a small amount in advance, and wait for confirmation so to speak.

  zh: 再次，结合起来使用这两个程序以提高结果是逻辑上的。使用群体算法或相对强度算法来确认在给定体制（或波）内预期的策略表现，是“假设测试”的终极形式。你基于历史测试，在给定状态下对给定策略构建一个理论，然后一旦确认了这个状态的存在，你观察策略是否按照预期在“现实”中表现。使用预期状态为基础的策略，将这提升到下一个维度，你预测最可能发生的哪些状态，然后寻找在确认你处于给定体制/波之前，策略表现方面的早期证据。你甚至可以提前下小额赌注，等待确认。
- en: Even if you are not creating an adaptive algorithm, these concepts are highly
    valuable for discretionary trading. After all, an algorithm is often designed
    to capture how a good trader with the objectivity and tools of a scientist would
    make a given decision. Thinking about these topics is a little less abstract for
    me because they relate directly to my experiences playing high level  No-Limit
    Texas Holdem. Everything you do to be successful at a high level involves anticipation
    of how a given hand will play in a certain situation, a calculation of possible
    outcomes, betting in advance, and waiting for confirmation before going “all-in.”
    However, even for highly intelligent people—or perhaps most dangerously for intelligent
    people, they wish to trade or invest (and in poker too!) in some deterministic
    universe where the proper course of action is always clear-cut and logical. On
    the other hand the average person wants to always be right, and desperately seeks
    a formula that is reliable with an unreasonable degree of accuracy. They spend
    most of their time seeking new gurus or indicators that will solve their problems,
    and unfortunately tend to select what has worked best in a regime that is already
    past its prime. As a consequence, they are always behind the curve, and lose with
    an incredibly high frequency. Thinking about market states is a perilous but highly
    profitable path for the un-initiated. However, it is worthwhile considering how
    these concepts will inevitably affect your trading.

  zh: 即使你不是在创建一个自适应算法，这些概念对于主观交易来说也是非常有价值的。毕竟，算法通常被设计来捕捉一个拥有科学家客观性和工具的优秀交易员是如何做出某个决定的。对我来说，思考这些话题稍微具体一些，因为它们直接与我玩高级无限制德州扑克的经验相关。你所做的一切为了在高水平上取得成功，都涉及到预测一个特定的手牌在某种情况下会如何表现，计算可能的结果，提前下注，并在确认后再“全押”。然而，即使对于智商很高的人来说——或许对于聪明人最危险的是，他们希望在一个确定性的宇宙中交易或投资（在扑克中也一样！）
    ，在那里正确的行动总是清晰明了且逻辑性强的。另一方面，普通人总是希望正确，迫切寻求一种具有不合理高准确度的可靠公式。他们把大部分时间花在寻找新的大师或指标上，希望解决他们的
    problems，不幸的是，他们倾向于选择在一个已经过了顶峰的体制中表现最好的东西。因此，他们总是落后于曲线，并且以极其高的频率输掉。对于未受initiated的人来说，思考市场状态是一条危险但利润丰厚的道路。然而，考虑这些概念将如何不可避免地影响你的交易是有价值的。
