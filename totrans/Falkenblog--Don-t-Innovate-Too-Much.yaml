    in an Ayn Rand fantasy, independent of others.  Yet, to succeed is to succeed
    socially, because we are social animals, so we need not just good ideas, but good
    ideas people are receptive to. This means, understand what customers/readers/users
    want, and what colleagues want to help you with.  Sure, you can do it yourself
    with sheer brilliance, but it's infinitely more difficult than simply extending
    someone else's work.
