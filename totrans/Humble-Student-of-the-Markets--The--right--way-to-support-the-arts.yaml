    focus in their lives, whether it be music, sports or other pursuits. This is especially
    critical during their adolescent years as they start to form their own identities.
    It's one of the key reasons why I became involved with the Vancouver Youth Symphony
    Orchestra Society. Participation in a VYSO orchestra teaches young musicians to
    focus on both their individual musical and orchestral skills. The latter is particularly
    important as many people can learn to play music, but a different skill is required
    when the conductor points to a section and have them all play the same sound at
    the same time. (That's why often school bands have "muddy" sounds - it's because
    they haven't learned orchestral skills.) It's much like the difference between
    learning to walk and learning to march in formation.

    It teaches them to have be focused, disciplined and have a passion about something,
    whether it`s music, sports or some other pursuit.
