    and geopolitical influences on financial markets. We have seen revolutions of
    various sizes and shapes in the likes of Tunisia, Egypt and Libya, with smaller
    uprisings in Bahrain, Algeria and elsewhere in North Africa and Middle East. For
    the most part, volatility in the equity markets has been rather muted prior to
    the Libyan revolution and its influence on [crude oil](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/crude%20oil)
    prices.

    I examine the year-to-date performance of five exchange-traded products (ETPs)
    that are central to the flight-to-safety trade. They include volatility ([VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX)),
    gold ([GLD](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/GLD)), oil ([USO](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/USO)),
    the dollar ([UUP](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/UUP)) and U.S. Treasuries
    ([TLT](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TLT)).

- en: Note that with the exception of crude oil, the political unrest in North Africa
    and the Middle East has not been disruptive enough to make these trades profitable
    ones in 2011, though there has been an uptick across the board since violence
    heated up in Egypt on January 25^(th) and in Libya starting on February 15^(th).
    The VXX chart does an excellent job of capturing the nature of the VXX gambit.
    Even with the geopolitical turmoil and spike in crude oil prices, this ETN is
    still down 16.2% on the year. The volatility spikes have provided VXX longs with
    very short-lived opportunities to capitalize on heightened market anxiety, with
    the chart reflecting the continued downward trend and high volatility in this
    ETN. *[As an aside, a similar chart swapping [VXZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXZ)
    for VXX would show very little difference in terms of performance.]*

    a geopolitical crisis, give some strong consideration to some alternative flight-to-safety
    plays.
