    the two.  Could probably devise a protocol based on asymmetrical trust, which
    is near-transactional.  The element which is least transactional is the wiring

- en: Case in point, exchanges such as BTC-e trade BTC/USD at a 100-150bp discount
    to bitfinex.  Why?   I think this due to the perceived credit risk of depositing
    funds with BTC-e and possibly issues in moving assets to net.

- en: Perhaps there is an even more interesting angle, PrimeBrokerage V2, using the
    bitcoin ledger, ascertaining trust, etc.    But for the moment, taking exchange
    risk out of the equation would open up the market further.
