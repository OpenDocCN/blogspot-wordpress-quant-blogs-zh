    one of them was just a link to a [website](http://www.richboroughmast.co.uk) detailing
    how Vigilant Global is seeking to build a mast in the Richborough (UK) in order
    to complete a microwave network between Frankfurt and London. As the news were
    impressive, I tweeted the link at the speed of light, and the event was covered
    by the [*Wall Stret Journal*](http://www.wsj.com/articles/high-speed-trader-drw-proposes-thousand-foot-plus-u-k-tower-1451937343)
    and even by [Matt Levine](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2016-01-05/a-tower-a-shoebox-and-a-maserati).
    I told a journalist once, “*I don’t want to appear as the ‘expert’ of the HFT microwave
    world*” but the answer was “*It’s too late!*”. Erf. Since the first season of “HFT
    in my backyard”, I continue to check out what is happening here in the air. I
    wanted to post a second season last November, but the events both in Paris and
    here in Molenbeek were too hard. As I don’t want this S02 to be too long, and
    as this new project in Richborough deserves explanations, here are some details
    about what may be in the future *the tallest tower ever built for high-frequency
    trading purposes in the world*. (Below I use “S01E0x” to refer to the old posts
    of “HFT in my backyard” season 1, and “S02” to indicate some developments will
    be made in the forthcoming season2.)

    name, latency has become critical. Each microsecond may count, and even a bit of
    data is important. In order to carry data faster than using optic fibres (most
    often not optimized to get the best latency), some HFT firms (Amsterdam-based
    firms Optiver or Flow Traders, or Chicago-based firms Jump Trading, Getco/KCG
    or DRW) and different microwave providers (such as McKay Brothers or Custom Connect) decided
    to build from scratch microwave networks to connect the main European exchanges:
    mainly Frankfurt in Germany (where Eurex is located), Slough in the West of London
    (where the Equinix data centre hosts Chi-X and other exchanges) and Basildon,
    of London (where the NYSE-Euronext data centre is). (But some also have microwave

    that crossing the Channel is quite challenging for many reasons, one of them being
    that microwaves need good atmospheric conditions and don’t really like fog, humidity,
    rain, etc. Managing microwave signals in a damp area is not that easy. What’s
    more, as the Germany-UK route needs to deal with different countries, *i.e.* different
    regulations (frequencies available in Belgium may not be allowed in the UK, etc.),
    so working with these different parameters is quite a challenge. Las but not least,
    given the fierce competition for speed, some networks may have to be updated,
    meaning that competitors need to find better (*i.e.* shorter) paths to improve
    their networks. For instance, if a firm has found a better way to cross the Channel,
    competitors need to follow the trend/path.

    Richborough, other kinds of towers had been in the landscape for decades. When
    it was decided to demolish the cooling towers, some locals had campaigned to keep
    them as they were “*a part of the historical landscape and were used as a navigation
    point by boats wanting to enter the mouth of the river Stour, known to have a
    narrow channel of useful depth*”. This kind of arguments may help Vigilant: after
    all, a 324-meter thin guyed tower is much more discreet than a big cooling tower,
    and with this giant mast fisherman could easily have a new navigation point.'

    What’s more, the Richborough residents/authorities will have to make two decisions:
    one about a giant but elegant mast carrying financial data between Frankfurt and
    Slough, and an other about a modest concrete tower carrying power between Richborough
    and Canterbury. They may decide to make a choice.'

    to build a structure taller than the Tour Eiffel, how much money is floating in
    the air? That was my question in 2014 when Jump purchased the Houtem tower. $5-6M to
    buy and rebuild a 243-meter tower in Belgium was quite an investment (one can
    estimate that this is the cost of a whole network between London and Frakfurt).
    It’s hard to evaluate how much money Vigilant will spend in Richborough; we may
    estimate the tower itself would cost ±$3M (depending on the prices of raw materials
    – the cables mainly) but additional costs should be considered (local taxes; cost
    of the broadband proposed to the community, etc.). Anyway, as microwave has become
    critical for HFT competitors in the Frankfurt-London route, there is probably
    enough money going through the air to justify the building of new tower. But a
    question remains : why Richborough?'
