## Natural Language Generation

Big Data opens up opportunities. FT has an interesting [article](http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/114a751e-4d1b-11e3-bf32-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2kzLiIIvg) on [Arria](https://www.arria.com/), and how its uses artificial intelligence software developed at the University of Aberdeen to sift through thousands of data points to produce written reports in English.  Oil and Gas case study [provides](https://www.arria.com/case-study-oilgas-A231.php) some insight to the technology – very cool.

FT also provides a [view](http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/e64eca88-4cf0-11e3-9f40-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2kzLiIIep) on IBM opening up Watson, its technology crown jewels.

Data becomes a 1st class citizen in application solutions.  Now all we need is testing to make the same jump in the software engineering world.
