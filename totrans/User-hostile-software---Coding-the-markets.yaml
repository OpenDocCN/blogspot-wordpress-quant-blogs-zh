    and inconsistent ?  For deliberately making life difficult for the user ? I know
    I’m drifting off topic here, but the thought crossed my mind as I used our corporate
    web based expense reporting system to file a claim for a conference I went to
    earlier this month.

    wilfully obscure. Is it just bad design, or should an expenses system be designed
    like that to cut down on employee claims ?

    It had an appallingly clunky Windows GUI that violated every possible expectation
    you might have about the interface – like TAB going to the next field. It was
    infuriating. Take a look at [Agresso](http://www.agresso.com)‘s stupid raging
    bull logo. No doubt it’s designed to appeal to alpha male senior managers. Ironically,
    it perfectly captures the mental state of a user after sustained exposure to its
    late 90s GUI. I guess that’s what happens when there’s a disconnect between purchasers
    and users. If we foisted crap like that on our traders, by golly we’d know about
    it pretty quick. They insist on minimal and intuitive keystrokes and mouse gestures.
