- en: I’ve experienced outsourcing and near shoring in the financial technology sector
    in several capacities over the last twenty years. I was London based for much
    of that time, and got involved in building and managing a team in Kiev, as well
    as working with teams based in Pune, Glasgow & Bournemouth. These days I live
    in a quiet rural location well outside London, and not so far from Birmingham.
    So I’m following the development of Birmingham’s fintech sector with interest.
