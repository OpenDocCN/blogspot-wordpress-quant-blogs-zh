- en: Several factors have combined to create turmoil in the oil patch. Most notably,
    the Deepwater Horizon oil spill has hammered the stocks of [BP](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/BP)
    and Transocean ([RIG](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/RIG)), while
    tainting the entire oil and oil services ([OIH](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/OIH),
    [XES](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/OIH)) sector. On top of the
    spill, the European sovereign debt crisis has generated concerns about an economic
    slowdown of the European region and beyond, while manufacturing data and other
    news out of China hints at the possibility of weakness in the most significant
    area for future growth in energy demand.

    and demand imbalance will likely suffer no more than a small dent as a result
    of the events of the last couple of months.

- en: The energy sector has a very promising future and I am looking to add to existing
    positions on weakness. As the chart below shows, there are some indications that
    [crude oil](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/crude%20oil) ([USO](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/USO))
    may have put in a bottom and the exploration and production ETF ([XOP](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XOP))
    may also be beginning a bottoming process as well. Outside of fossil fuels, alternative
    energy plays in [solar](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/solar%20stocks)
    ([TAN](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TAN), [KWT](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/KWT))
    and wind ([FAN](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/FAN), [PWND](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/PWND))
    are somewhat suspect in that critical governmental subsidies from the likes of
    Spain and Germany appear to be a victim of the sovereign debt crisis. Still, these
    alternative energy plays, including some broad-based alternative energy ETFs ([GEX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/GEX),
    [PBD](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/PBD)), have also been marked
    down dramatically and should also benefit as crude oil prices start to rebound
    and governments come under increasing pressure to make use of ecologically sustainable
    energy sources.
