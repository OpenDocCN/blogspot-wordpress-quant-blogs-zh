- en: Another day with some travel, and time to read the latest ThoughWorks Technology
    [Radar](http://www.thoughtworks.com/radar).  I see both Clojure and Scala are
    in the adopt Languages & Frameworks.  The problem I see for both languages in
    the financial space is that there is still some considerable bias to the Java
    stack from a historical “architecture governance board” perspective, which is
    sometimes a blocker in the worst case, and in other just a speed bump 😦  If you
    can get access to these languages, then clearly the best scenario is to understand
    the language ROI, and leverage the languages as appropriate on an initial project. 
    Then use this project to “market” the benefits within the organisation and gain
    traction.  A quick Google will show that in London alone there are a number (although
    small) of opportunities for [Scala](http://wikimatze.de/benefits-of-scala.html)/[Clojure](http://corfield.org/blog/post.cfm/clojure-in-the-enterprise)
    work within finance, often around “highly distributed, risk and pricing platform”
    projects.  Hopefully the financial communicate will continue to realise that the
    one size fits all language rule that has historically been set within corporations
    for the last n years needs a more frequent review, and that in some cases a revised
    rule partially tied to problem/solution is required.
