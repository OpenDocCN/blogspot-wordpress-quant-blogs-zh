- en: The study below is one that I have shown before, but not for a while.  It looks
    at days like Thursday where SPY posts an unfilled gap down that closes poorly
    while the market is in a short-term downtrend, but a long-term uptrend. Results
    are updated.

    weeks.  This one favors the bulls.
