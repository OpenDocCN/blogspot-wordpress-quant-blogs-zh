    Equity' funds, they escaped my radar but really these are 'low vol' funds (eg, U.S.
    Defensive Equity Fund AUEIX, the AQR International Defensive Equity Fund (ANDIX),
    and the AQR Emerging Defensive Equity Fund (AZEIX)).

    to retain industry and factor neutrality, where the factors are such things as
    value, size and momentum. Considering that

    come from, say, the SPLV, the popular low vol ETF that just swipes the bottom
    100 stocks from the SP500\. Basically,

    industries or extreme-factor loading stocks become less volatile.  By minimizing
    factor exposures tracking error will be less correlated with factors, which I
    can empathize with because if you underperform by 5% one year it feels better
    if its from something you can't control (the serenity prayer).

    simple but it gets you a long way towards capturing the low vol effect: much lower
    vol, perhaps a slight return bump. In contrast, Russell''s failed LVOL ETF tried
    to take it to the next level by getting really complicated, although I can see
    how, with a bunch of PhDs in a room it all made perfect sense. SPLV nicely keeps
    US low vol funds focused.'

- en: Like the other strategies in the low volatility space AQR expects betas of around
    0.7, and volatility of about 1/3 lower than their regional equity benchmarks.
    Such a claim is realistic because that has been the result of other funds that
    have plied this strategy in real time over the past 7 years. As long as the Security
    Market Line (Beta on x-axis, average return on y-axis) is empirically flat this
    approach seems a no-brainer to any MBA because you can get the same return for
    70% of the volatility; a low beta/vol focus has a higher Sharpe. [I'd say things
    about AQR's performance, but our far-sighted regulators make that parlous in their
    efforts to protect widows and orphans].

  zh: 就像低波动空间中的其他策略一样，AQR预计beta约为0.7，波动性约为其区域性股票基准的1/3低。这样的说法是现实的，因为在过去7年中，已有其他基金在实际运行中使用这种策略取得了这样的结果。只要安全市场线（x轴上的Beta，y轴上的平均回报）在经验上是平的，这种方法对任何MBA来说似乎是一个免费的选择，因为你可以以70%的波动性获得相同的回报；低beta/波动性的关注点具有更高的夏普比率。【我会对AQR的业绩说一些话，但是我们有远见的监管机构在努力保护寡妇和孤儿，所以这样的言论有危险。】
- en: Frazzini mentioned that in non-developed countries, the volatility reduction
    is even greater within those regions, and clearly for any investor taking advantage
    of international diversification seems a straightforward way to reduce volatility
    and covariance with one's income much more than staying local.

  zh: Frazzini提到，在不发达国家，波动性的降低幅度甚至更大，在这些地区，对于任何投资者来说，利用国际分散投资似乎是一种简单的方式，可以比留在本地更有效地降低波动性和收入的协方差。
