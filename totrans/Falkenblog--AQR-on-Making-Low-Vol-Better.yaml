    Equity' funds, they escaped my radar but really these are 'low vol' funds (eg, U.S.
    Defensive Equity Fund AUEIX, the AQR International Defensive Equity Fund (ANDIX),
    and the AQR Emerging Defensive Equity Fund (AZEIX)).

    to retain industry and factor neutrality, where the factors are such things as
    value, size and momentum. Considering that

    come from, say, the SPLV, the popular low vol ETF that just swipes the bottom
    100 stocks from the SP500\. Basically,

    industries or extreme-factor loading stocks become less volatile.  By minimizing
    factor exposures tracking error will be less correlated with factors, which I
    can empathize with because if you underperform by 5% one year it feels better
    if its from something you can't control (the serenity prayer).

    simple but it gets you a long way towards capturing the low vol effect: much lower
    vol, perhaps a slight return bump. In contrast, Russell''s failed LVOL ETF tried
    to take it to the next level by getting really complicated, although I can see
    how, with a bunch of PhDs in a room it all made perfect sense. SPLV nicely keeps
    US low vol funds focused.'

- en: Like the other strategies in the low volatility space AQR expects betas of around
    0.7, and volatility of about 1/3 lower than their regional equity benchmarks.
    Such a claim is realistic because that has been the result of other funds that
    have plied this strategy in real time over the past 7 years. As long as the Security
    Market Line (Beta on x-axis, average return on y-axis) is empirically flat this
    approach seems a no-brainer to any MBA because you can get the same return for
    70% of the volatility; a low beta/vol focus has a higher Sharpe. [I'd say things
    about AQR's performance, but our far-sighted regulators make that parlous in their
    efforts to protect widows and orphans].

    is even greater within those regions, and clearly for any investor taking advantage
    of international diversification seems a straightforward way to reduce volatility
    and covariance with one's income much more than staying local.
