- en: As a naturally competitive person (as are most traders) I always jump at the
    opportunity to compete in just about anything. When it comes to research–my first
    love– nothing motivates me more than the chance to display my work to some of
    the brightest minds in the business. I will be submitting an entry to this year’s
    2010 Wagner Award to the National Association of Active Investment Managers (NAAIM).
    [http://www.naaim.org/index.php](http://www.naaim.org/index.php) I would strongly
    encourage all of the intelligent and creative readers of this blog that I come
    into contact with on a daily basis to consider making a submission. If not for
    the pure competition/money/fame,  it is a chance for you to share some great ideas
    and help improve the body of knowledge that makes us all better investors. [http://www.naaim.org/files/NAAIMCallforPapers2010.pdf](http://www.naaim.org/files/NAAIMCallforPapers2010.pdf)
