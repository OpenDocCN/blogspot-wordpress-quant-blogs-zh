- en: '“The Final Problem” [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Final_Problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Final_Problem
    "final problem") is a Sherlock Holmes story that contains interesting references
    to modern game theory. Holmes- the legendary detective- is on a mission to foil
    an equally intelligent adversary- Moriarty. Holmes is forced to choose beyond
    conventional decisions to account for the fact that Moriarty is likely to deduce
    his response based upon what he himself would do in such a situation. A good analysis/synopsis
    of the problem is presented by Blume in presentation on game theory: [http://www.pitt.edu/~ablume/Game%20Theory%20Principles/game-slides-3.pdf](http://www.pitt.edu/~ablume/Game%20Theory%20Principles/game-slides-3.pdf)'

- en: Both central banks and large investors are constantly engaged in these type
    of games. This often baffles less sophisticated investors who are looking for
    market responses that reflect the favorability of decisions made by central banks.
    Instead, the response is a complex reaction based upon expectations and the degree
    to which they are already priced. It is worthwhile to think of “The Final Problem”
    as a useful analog when considering what direction the market may take given a
    policy event or announcement.
