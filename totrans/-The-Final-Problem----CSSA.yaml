    "final problem") is a Sherlock Holmes story that contains interesting references
    to modern game theory. Holmes- the legendary detective- is on a mission to foil
    an equally intelligent adversary- Moriarty. Holmes is forced to choose beyond
    conventional decisions to account for the fact that Moriarty is likely to deduce
    his response based upon what he himself would do in such a situation. A good analysis/synopsis
    of the problem is presented by Blume in presentation on game theory: [http://www.pitt.edu/~ablume/Game%20Theory%20Principles/game-slides-3.pdf](http://www.pitt.edu/~ablume/Game%20Theory%20Principles/game-slides-3.pdf)'

    "最终问题")是一篇包含现代博弈论有趣引用的福尔摩斯故事。传奇侦探福尔摩斯正致力于挫败同样聪明的对手——莫里亚蒂。福尔摩斯被迫做出超越常规的选择，以考虑到莫里亚蒂可能会根据自己在这种情况下的行为来推断他的反应。Blume在关于博弈论的演讲中提供了一个很好的问题分析/概述：[http://www.pitt.edu/~ablume/Game%20Theory%20Principles/game-slides-3.pdf](http://www.pitt.edu/~ablume/Game%20Theory%20Principles/game-slides-3.pdf)
- en: Both central banks and large investors are constantly engaged in these type
    of games. This often baffles less sophisticated investors who are looking for
    market responses that reflect the favorability of decisions made by central banks.
    Instead, the response is a complex reaction based upon expectations and the degree
    to which they are already priced. It is worthwhile to think of “The Final Problem”
    as a useful analog when considering what direction the market may take given a
    policy event or announcement.

  zh: 中央银行和大投资者始终参与这类博弈。这常常让那些寻求市场反应以反映中央银行决策利好的不太成熟的投资者感到困惑。相反，市场的反应是基于预期及其已定价程度的一种复杂反应。在考虑政策事件或公告可能引导市场走向何方时，将“The
    Final Problem”视为一个有用的类比是值得的。
