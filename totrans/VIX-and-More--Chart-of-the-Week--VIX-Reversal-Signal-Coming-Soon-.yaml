    below shows weekly bars of the S&P 500 index and the VIX going back three years.
    In the VIX study at the bottom, I have also highlighted in yellow the zone from
    15-18, which has proven to be a fairly robust zone of support for the VIX during
    this period. Note that while the VIX has slipped below 15 on occasion, it has
    eventually bounced off of this support level in each instance and, perhaps more
    notably, a [VIX bottom](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20bottom)
    in the 15-18 range has also coincided with a top in the SPX each time around.

    on the lookout for signs of a bottom forming in the VIX – and be prepared to position
    their portfolios accordingly.
