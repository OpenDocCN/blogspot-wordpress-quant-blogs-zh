    of my questions was “name the two or three most important people in shaping your
    life so far, either personally or professionally (and it’s OK to say it’s your
    mother).” That was, I could get a sense of the person’s interests, passions and
    more importantly, how he looks at the world.

    my thinking were Michael Porter and Jane Jacobs. My interest came from my stint
    as an emerging markets manager during the mid 1990s.

    local investment managers, local brokers and then the companies, in that order
    of preference. Usually local investors drove the market and it was important to
    understand their analytical viewpoint. The local brokers also instinctively understand
    this and will tailor how they cover the local companies and industries accordingly.
    Until an investor understands how the local companies trade it will be impossible
    or risky to develop a quantitative framework for those companies.

    over and over again.

    economic study programs focus on the China and India success stories but don’t
    focus on the failures. (Incidentally, one of the questions back in my youth was
    “why can’t India be like Japan?”)

    development as they migrate up the value chain and also of the importance of industry
    clusters. Later I also discovered Jane Jacobs’ work, see examples

    thing as Porter on the issue of moving through stages of development. The important
    difference is that Jacobs identified city and city-states as the units of growth,
    rather than nations. While Porter alluded to this point with his industry cluster
    comment, Jacobs was more explicit.

    as the issue of how to revive inner cities? This is a controversial topic and
    comments are not only welcome but invited.
