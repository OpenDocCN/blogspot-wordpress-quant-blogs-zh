## Skill Cloud – Part 2

Continuing on from a previous posting.  There are a number of [sources](http://hbr.org/2013/12/the-hidden-benefits-of-keeping-teams-intact/ar/1) that discuss team [interactions](http://et.nwresd.org/files/The%20Value%20of%20Keeping%20Teams%20Together.pdf), more specifically keeping teams that work well together, together.  Of interest are the following comments:

> At a software services firm, a 50% increase in team familiarity was followed by a 19% decrease in defects and a 30% decrease in deviations from budget. On audit and consulting teams, high familiarity yielded a 10% improvement in performance, as judged by clients.
> 
> Members new to one another simply don’t understand when and how to communicate. Some groups never master this; and even in groups that do, the pro- cess takes time, slowing progress toward team goals.
> 
> Teams are increasingly asked to pivot mid-project be- cause of competitive pressures or shifts in customer preferences. This creates stress and requires flexibility. Team familiarity provides a common platform from which the group can work to meet such new demands.

Which leads to the following thought: Maybe as part of assessing the project risks, a Skill’s Cloud should be populated with historical team interactions – big data small data dataset, thus allowing a project to assess how quickly the team will begin interacting and working to solve a problem, coupled with the possible flare points within a team?
