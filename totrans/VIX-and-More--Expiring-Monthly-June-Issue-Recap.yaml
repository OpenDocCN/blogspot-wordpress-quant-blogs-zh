    don’t follow [SCI](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SCI), [HI](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/HI),
    [STEI](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/STEI), [STON](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/STON)
    and [CSV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/CSV)), I have attached a
    copy of the Table of Contents for the June issue below. This month the magazine
    focuses on two subjects in particular: options strategy backtesting and volatility.
    The feature article, penned by Jared Woodard, puts three volatility trading strategies
    through their paces via backtesting.'
