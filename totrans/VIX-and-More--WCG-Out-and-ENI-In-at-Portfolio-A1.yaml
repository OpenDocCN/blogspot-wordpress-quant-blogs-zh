    and [raised full year revenue and earnings guidance](http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/070503/gartner_outlook.html?.v=1)
    before the bell Thursday, then rode [bullish analyst comments](http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/070504/gartner_mover.html?.v=1)
    up 8% Friday, helping to offset some of the continued weak performance from [WellCare
    Health Plans (WCG)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=wcg&hl=en), which is being
    dropped from the portfolio.  WCG has been a significant drag on portfolio performance
    and is largely responsible for reducing the cumulative performance advantage over
    the benchmark S&P 500 from last week’s 6.8% to this week’s 4.4%.

    in search of a fifth and final holding that will provide a little more diversification
    without dragging down performance.  With WCG out, the portfolio now turns to Chilean
    hydroelectric company [Enersis (ENI)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=eni&hl=en)
    to see if it can fill that bill.  [Will Frankenhoff](http://www.fool.com/about/staff/willfrankenhoff/author.htm)

    on April 25^(th), Enersis has moved up another 10%, but Portfolio A1’s stock ranking
    system is undeterred and believes Enersis still represents a good value.
