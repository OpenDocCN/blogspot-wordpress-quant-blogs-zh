- en: kdb+ v3.0 (major release) follows other products in leveraging Intel’s Sandy
    Bridge technology.  Curiously, Kx Systems press [release](http://low-latency.com/article/kx-releases-new-version-kdb)
    sites [FX](http://tabbforum.com/videos/fx-challenges-fo-the-mid-tier?utm_source=TabbFORUM)
    as well as equities as one of the reason for the data expansion.  kdb+ also follows
    many web products in supporting WebSockets.  Unclear if one would really want
    to expose kdb+ over the internet from a security perspective 😉
