- en: The study below looks at instances of SPX and VIX both closing positive on a
    Friday. The VIX has a tendency to move opposite the SPX, so when they move in
    the same direction, it can often suggest an edge over the next few days. Due to
    calendar effects the VIX has a natural tendency to sink on Friday afternoons as
    we approach the weekend. So seeing the SPX and VIX both rise is less common on
    Fridays than any other day of the week. This is why I use Friday as a filter in
    the below test.

    numbers here suggest a short-term downside edge.
