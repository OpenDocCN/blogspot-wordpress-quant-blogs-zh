- en: continues to believe that the Fed wants to throw a party. So let's have some
    fun, maintain trailing stops and don't worry. The one caveat to this outlook is
    - we should party as long as China doesn't slow down into a hard landing.

- en: So long as China does not overdo it on its tightening moves — raising reserve
    requirements is indeed preferable to interest rate hikes — then commodity prices
    in general should remain on an uptrend even if a corrective phase should be expected
    after the QE2-related surge of the past few months. There is enough evidence supporting
    the notion that the Asian economy has decoupled from the U.S. consumer, and therefore,
    basic materials should still be a core holding in any given investment portfolio.

    to stop expanding their loan books to avoid exceeding the annual quotas.

    to come. The key to the market’s outlook is the Chinese plans for next year. Will
    they continue to tighten? Or with growth slowing, which heightens the risk of
    economic pressures and unrest from rising unemployment, will the Chinese authorities
    step on the accelerator again?

- en: I believe that the latest round of quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve
    will have the effect of exporting asset price inflation to China, whose effects
    are unavoidable as long as China maintains a managed USD-RMB peg. Any administrative
    effects such as restricting bank loans or raising reserve requirements are therefore
    likely to have minor effects on the Chinese economy.

    avoided a double-dip recession. The 3Q GDP print at 2.5% was ahead of the consensus
    of 2.4% seems to be one sign that the economy is more robust than the bears believe.

- en: I have also been monitoring the relative performance of the Morgan Stanley Cyclical
    Index (CYC), which is shown below. The CYC appears to be forming a bullish ascending
    triangle relative to the market. While the formation isn't complete until we see
    an upside breakout, these are not signs of a market that is likely to show significant
    weakness beyond the normal 5-10% corrections that may occur from time to time.

  zh: 我还在监测摩根士丹利周期指数（CYC）的相对表现，如下所示。与市场相比，CYC似乎正在形成一个看涨的上升三角形。虽然在我们看到向上的突破之前，这个形态还没有完成，但这并不是一个可能会显示出超过正常5-10%的调整之外显著弱势的市场迹象。
- en: On the bearish side, the market remains overbought and sentiment is at or very
    close to crowded long territory, which is contrarian bearish. These factors suggest
    that equities are vulnerable to minor corrections but should be bought on weakness.

  zh: 在看跌方面，市场仍然处于超买状态，市场情绪处于或非常接近拥挤的多头区域，这对于逆向看跌是有利的。这些因素表明，股票市场容易受到小幅调整的影响，但在疲软时应该买入。
