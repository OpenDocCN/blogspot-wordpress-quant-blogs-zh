    and Renée Mauborgne argue that companies can succeed by creating "blue oceans"
    of uncontested market space, as opposed to "red oceans" where competitors fight
    for dominance, the analogy being that an ocean full of vicious competition turns

    for the company, its buyers, and its employees while unlocking new demand and
    making the competition irrelevant. The book presents analytical frameworks and
    tools to foster an organization's ability to systematically create and capture
