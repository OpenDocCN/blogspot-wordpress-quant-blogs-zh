[Michael Kearns](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns) and colleagues from [Penn](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/) and [UT](http://www.cs.utexas.edu) did some interesting microstructure work years back with the [Penn-Lehman Automated Trading](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/projects/plat.html) (PLAT) and Penn Exchange Simulator (PXS) projects.

Having read these articles years ago, recent reference by [etrading](http://etrading.wordpress.com/) brought back memories.

Numerous of the following papers give readers a flavor of the challenge trading microstructure, with the state-of-the-art now miles beyond these undergrad papers:

Are any readers are familiar with an open source modern limit book exchange simulator (*i.e.* modern equivalent of PXS)? Fun weekend project would be to build up a few trading bots and compete against a Hasbrouck model.
