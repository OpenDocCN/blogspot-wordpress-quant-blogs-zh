    [Daily Options Report](http://adamsoptions.blogspot.com/) and I had the bright
    idea to debate where volatility would trade during this past extended options
    cycle.'

    for lots of dead time during the options cycle leading to lower volatility, perhaps
    as low as single digits.  I took the [easy way out](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/06/vix-implosion-ahead.html)
    and predicted that volatility was most likely to remain in the 12.50 – 15.00 range
    that it looked like it was settling in to at the time.

    with volatility taking the two of us out in straight sets and sending [Bud Collins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bud_Collins)
    (not pictured) officially into retirement.  As the VIX chart below shows, volatility
    spent almost the entire options cycle in the 15.00 – 19.00 range, with the 15.00
    resistance that I was counting on a month ago now looking like support. And this
    is the bigger story.

    volatility forecasting is extremely difficult. With an additional month of hindsight,
    however, 15.00 now looks suspiciously like a floor in this all-important volatility
    measure.  If this turns out to be the case, then I can safely say we are entering
    a new era of increasing volatility.  In fact, I think it is just about time to
    update the long-term VIX chart I offered up on my [first post](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/01/week-in-vix-january-7-2007-introduction.html)
    on this blog some 6 ½ months ago by adding a fifth macro period.  Ironically,
    as it turns out, this new period of increasing volatility neatly coincides with
    the life of this blog.  You don’t think…?  Nah.
