- en: how the S&P 500 has performed following days where the market dropped 5% or
    more. In most cases such a strong reaction was an overreaction and the market
    closed above the close of the 5% drop day shortly thereafter.

- en: Since I showed that table a month ago we have had SIX more 5% drops. Five of
    the six saw the same pattern with some kind of bounce in the next few days. Below
    I’ve updated the table which lists all 5% drop days and whether they closed above
    the 5% drop day close in the next week.
