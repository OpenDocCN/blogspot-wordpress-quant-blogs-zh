    and taking action to start pushing their field in a better direction.

    (??) Nobel Prize winners of "greed, rationality and equilibrium" who OUGHT to
    be desperate to find better ideas and to lead the way, but by students acting
    on their own (with some help from INET). I''m encouraged by their energy and willingness
    to think openly:'

    we are organizing the second Rethinking Economics conference, in order to broaden
    our insights into modern economic thinking. As the [summer conference in 2012](https://sites.google.com/site/rethinkeconomics/2012-impressions/2012%20RE%20Conference%20Documentation_HP.pdf?attredirects=0&d=1)
    has shown that university education puts too little attention on issues of epistemology
    and the history of economic science, this year’s conference aims to stress the
    methodological plurality of recent economic research. Therefore we are seeking
    to promote the exchange with new economic thinkers of all strands and like-minded
    economics students. **Why rethink economics?** Most of current economic research
    considers economics as a self-equilibrating system populated by rational individuals.
    It lacks interactions that can endogenously explain crises that we have seen in
    the real world. Alternative approaches, however, offer inspiring new perspectives
    to economic phenomena and provide ideas how the deficiencies of current economic
    paradigms may be solved. Frictions and irrationalities in general, and, for example,
    the nature and political economy of financial markets and systemic instability
    in particular, are not treated as unattractive deviations from theoretical ideals,
    but are incorporated as main features of the model. These theories show that aside
    from neoclassical approaches there are different ways of thinking about economics,
    which allow understanding economic dynamics better.'

    of economic research since the outbreak of the financial crisis. Our summer conference
    aims to offer an insight into modern strands of economics and to promote and accelerate
    new economic thinking among young students of economics. The conference will cover
    Complexity Economics, Agent-Based Modeling, Neuroeconomics, Postkeynesian Economics,
    and Behavioral Economics. These theories will be applied to topics such as non-equilibrium
    economics, contagion in the banking sector, instability of preferences, the links
    between the financial sector and the real economy, and empirical evidence on neoclassical
    assumptions from psychology, sociology, anthropology, and neuroscience.'

    neighboring fields.  We invite open-minded economic thinkers of all semesters,
    and will therefore provide workshops that do not assume many previous knowledge
    of the topic discussed. Every lecturer will provide a reading list, which enables
    the participants to prepare themselves in advance. The conference will be complemented
    by a panel discussion open to the public, dealing with the future of economic
    modeling.'
