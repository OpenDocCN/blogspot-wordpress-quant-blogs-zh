- en: ': One of the concerns I had after last Friday''s market turnaround was that
    a bounce had become the consensus view. Virtually every technical analyst was
    calling for a bear market rally, followed by further weakness. It sounded too
    easy. Either the bounce was going to fail, or the market was going to roar to
    new highs.'

    yesterday (Tuesday), but managed to give it all back and more today. The hourly
    S&P 500 chart exhibited a possible upside breakout through an inverse head and
    shoulders pattern, which was thwarted by today's weakness. While there is nothing
    worse than a failed breakout, it could be argued that the market is in the process
    of forming the last shoulder of the formation.
