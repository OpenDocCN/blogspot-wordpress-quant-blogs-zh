- en: ': One of the concerns I had after last Friday''s market turnaround was that
    a bounce had become the consensus view. Virtually every technical analyst was
    calling for a bear market rally, followed by further weakness. It sounded too
    easy. Either the bounce was going to fail, or the market was going to roar to
    new highs.'

  zh: ：上周五市场反转后我担心的一点是，反弹已成为共识。几乎每位技术分析师都在预测熊市反弹，然后是进一步的疲软。听起来太容易了。要么反弹会失败，要么市场会涨至新高。
- en: The market followed through Friday's strength with a 2% gain in the S&P 500
    yesterday (Tuesday), but managed to give it all back and more today. The hourly
    S&P 500 chart exhibited a possible upside breakout through an inverse head and
    shoulders pattern, which was thwarted by today's weakness. While there is nothing
    worse than a failed breakout, it could be argued that the market is in the process
    of forming the last shoulder of the formation.

  zh: 市场继上周五的强势之后，昨天（星期二）标普500指数上涨了2%，但今天却全盘收回并更多。标普500指数的小时图表显示了一个可能的逆头肩模式的向上突破，但被今天的疲软所挫败。虽然没有比失败的突破更糟糕的事情，但可以认为市场正在形成该模式的最后一个肩膀。
