# Humble Student of the Markets: A classic washout bottom

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2021/09/a-classic-washout-bottom.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2021/09/a-classic-washout-bottom.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models** 

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post, 

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The 

**Trend Asset Allocation Model**

 is an asset allocation model that applies trend following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. The performance and full details of a model portfolio based on the out-of-sample signals of the Trend Model can be found

[here](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/trend-model-report-card/)

.

My inner trader uses a 

**trading model**

, which is a blend of price momentum (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa). Subscribers receive real-time alerts of model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of the email alerts is updated weekly

. The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that began in March 2016 is shown below.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Buy equities*
*   Trend Model signal: Bullish*
*   Trading model: Neutral*

**Panic and recovery**

Last week, I wrote, "A tactical low looks near.,,[but] traders should be open to the possibility that the market may need one final panic for a tradable bottom to appear." What I didn't expect was the China Evergrande panic that gripped the market, though the subsequent relief rally was not unexpected. 

The S&P 500 fell -4% from its all-time high and rebounded by the end of the week to regain its 50-day moving average. The VIX Index flashed a buy signal when it rose above its upper Bollinger Band last week. However, traders should be aware of the caveat that rallies can stall once the VIX recycles from above the upper BB to the 20 dma. This scenario is a very real possibility as market jitters over a debt ceiling impasse, Treasury default, and a widespread government shutdown looms ahead.
