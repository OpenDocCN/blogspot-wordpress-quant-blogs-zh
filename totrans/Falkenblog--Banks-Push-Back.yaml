    have continued to debate the results. Several banks, including Bank of America
    Corp. and Citigroup Inc., have challenged the government's findings.

    a higher quality of capital, in order to continue lending if the economy worsens
    through 2010.

    to a 13% unemployment rate and 20% house price fall is to lose 30% of its value,
    the banks say 10%, the data will be inconclusive. The standard errors to this
    hypothetical are too large. Lots of details matter: loan-to-value, fico scores,
    loan vintage--and these interact in various ways, and as home prices have not
    fallen a lot historically, you have very few observations to generate an empirical
    estimate of a multivariate relationship. Thus, if the Treasury does force their
    stress tests through, and equity investors lose 50% of their value, I smell lawsuit.
    Remember that in the S&L crisis, many bank recovered billions as courts found
    the government''s redefinition as to what counts as capital, sufficient for a
    bank to be a going concern, was not justified.'
