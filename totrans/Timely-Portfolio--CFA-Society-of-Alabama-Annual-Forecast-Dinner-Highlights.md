This year’s [CFA Society of Alabama Annual Forecast Dinner](http://www.membersocieties.org/ALABAMA/Pages/AnnualForecastDinner.aspx) was a huge success with over 230 attendees and over 20 sponsors.  Thanks to all those who helped.

Dan Clifton from Strategas, Gina Martin Adams from Wells Fargo, and Carter Worth from Oppenheimer offered their opinions in a panel discussion on debt, emerging markets, demographics, and best ideas for 2011.  Their unique perspectives from their different approaches gave the audience a comprehensive view of the most important current financial topics.
