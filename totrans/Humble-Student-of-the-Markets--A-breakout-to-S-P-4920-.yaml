    quadruple witching, the S&P 500 held support at its 50 dma.

    and shoulders patterns are incomplete until the neckline breaks. If the index
    can stage an upside breakout above resistance, then traders can declare a risk-on
    tone to the market. On the other hand, if the S&P 500 were to undercut the "head"
    at about 4500 and invalidate the inverse head and shoulders pattern, things could
    get very ugly.
