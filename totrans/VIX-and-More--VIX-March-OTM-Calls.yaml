    claims he’s on vacation, but he continues to ponder the significance of the [large
    open interest March VIX calls](http://buttonwood1792.blogspot.com/2007/02/quick-friday-vacation-post.html)
    all the way up to the 20 strike.

- en: 'From looking at the open interest patterns out through February 2009, I can
    only find one other area where it looks like a snake swallowed a cow: the open
    interest of 63,171 in April 11 puts.  My (highly inexpert) guess is that someone
    has taken a significant long position in April 11 puts and hedged some of this
    in March with long calls across the 15-20 strike range.  If this is the case,
    it is an interesting way to play the current volatility environment and suggests
    that a lot of money is going on the fat tails and betting against the type of
    orderly rise in volatility that would be associated with a mild correction in
    the SPX.'
