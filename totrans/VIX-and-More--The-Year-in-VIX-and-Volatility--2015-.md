# VIX and More: The Year in VIX and Volatility (2015)

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2016/01/the-year-in-vix-and-volatility-2015.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2016/01/the-year-in-vix-and-volatility-2015.html#0001-01-01)

Every year one of my most-read posts is my annotated overview of the year in VIX and volatility.  Now that I have been doing this for the past eight years, the aggregated view of volatility from 2008 to the present makes for a fascinating concise history not just of volatility, but more broadly of the financial markets and of economic activity in general.

The graphic below captures most of the highlights from 2015 and from a volatility perspective, it was a year for the record books.  During August we saw the largest one-week

[VIX spike](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20spikes)

(+113%) that resulted from unprecedented back-to-back days of VIX spikes of more than 45%!  The cumulative jump in the VIX pushed the VIX to a high of 53.29 – the only time outside of the 2008-09 financial crisis since the launch of the VIX in 1993 that the VIX has topped 50.

While most investors pointed to

as the proximate cause of the record VIX spike(s), a VIX and More

one week after the big VIX spike also highlighted “market structural integrity (

, exchange issues, etc.)” as almost on par with China concerns, with “market technical factors (breach of support, end of trend, etc.)” not that far behind.

The balance of the year saw a wide variety of events that moved the markets, including the Fed’s first rate hike in nine years;

plummeting to $34/bbl.; shock waves in the high-yield bond market due to low oil prices; chilling terrorist attacks in Paris and in California;

announcing it will default on some of its debt; turmoil in the

markets when the Swiss National Bank ended the peg of the Swiss franc to the euro; a dramatic boom-bust cycle in Chinese A-shares – and a flurry of ineffective interventions on the part of the Chinese government to restore stability; a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and

in Yemen; and the European Central Bank committing to $1.2 trillion of quantitative easing.

Finally, since 2011, I have been maintaining a proprietary

[Macro Risk Index](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Macro%20Risk%20Index)

that measures volatility and risk across a broad range of asset classes, including U.S. equities, foreign equities,

[commodities](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/commodities)

, currencies and bonds.  In 2015, the Macro Risk Index was consistently higher than it has been during any year since the 2011 inception.
