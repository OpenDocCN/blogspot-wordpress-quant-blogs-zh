- en: Monday marked the 5th day in a row that the S&P 500 closed below its lower Bollinger
    Band (20 period, 2 std dev). Looking back to 1960 I found only 23 other occurrences.
    Of those, 22 managed to close higher than the trigger-day close at some point
    in the next 3 days.

    well overdue. To this point, though, the bounce has evaded us. I expect it shouldn’t
    be too much longer until we see it.
