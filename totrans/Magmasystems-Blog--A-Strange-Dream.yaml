    and went to work for Google. When I got there, I found myself in a big loft, surrounded
    by 20-something year old geniuses. I asked them where my desk and computer was.
    They looked at me with puzzlement. I asked then where all of the computer monitors
    were, and they didn't know what a computer monitor was. I started describing how,
    on the trading floor where I worked, the traders has 6 or 8 monitors stacked on
    their desks. Then everyone started to laugh at me.

    of what a desktop system was, and the fact that a trader had multiple monitors
    seemed absurd. The Google-ites didn't even have desks. They just sat on the floor
    wherever they wanted with their laptops.
