# Quantifiable Edges: When Fed Days Close at Intermediate-Term Lows

In last night’s letter I examined 20-day lows that occur on Fed Days during long-term uptrends. The results appeared interesting. You'll find the stats table below.

Over the first 1-4 day period there doesn't appear to be much of an edge. But over the 5-10 day period the market has reliably risen. Instances are low, but I still thought the two-week results were strong enough to keep in mind and give some consideration.
