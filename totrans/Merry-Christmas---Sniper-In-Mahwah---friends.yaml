- en: The end of 2014 has been intense. A lot of things to do, unrelated to HFT –
    I decided to set up a new book company in Brussels with an untypical associate.
    This new firm, named [Vies parallèles](http://www.vies-paralleles.org) (a tribute
    to Plutarch’s *Parallel Lives*) will start in March 2015 with the crazy project
    to publish the first of the ten volumes of Hungarian writer Miklós Szentkuthy’s *St.
    Orpheus’ Breviary* series. The second volume will be published in 2016… and the
    last one in 2025 (for the English readers who could be interested by reading the
    books of the “*Hungarian James Joyce*”, in 2012 Contra Mundum released in English
    the [first](http://contramundum.net/catalog/current/marginalia-on-casanova/) volume.)
    It was quite exciting to create a book design/layout which has to work for the
    next ten years.

- en: 'Back to HFT and market microstructure, I wanted to review the last Paris conference
    *[Market Microstructure: confronting many viewpoints](http://market-microstructure.institutlouisbachelier.org/?lng=FR)* where
    most of the speakers gave very interesting talks, but since I was invited to present my
    own anthropological researches in front of all these speakers, that would be a
    little discourteous to criticize some academic presentations I found too much
    theoretical because of the lack of data; but, after all, this was the aim of the conference:
    confronting different theories. I’m still working on the (last) part V of “HFT
    in my backyard” series (the past and the future of information transmission between
    financial exchanges), but I am still waiting for additional information about
    some future transatlantic projects. I should post this last part on January 5,
    2015.'

- en: 'I have to tell you the truth: I got distracted by the reading of more than
    1500 fascinating pages about high-frequency trading. Early november I checked the
    stats of the blog and I realized that most of the (sometimes addicted) readers
    of my microwave series are HFT and EMM firms (but that goes without saying). I
    was amused to parse the logs and find the names of banks or those of companies
    I talk about (Jump Trading, DRW, Optiver, Flow Traders, KCG, etc.), and I was
    also happy to find firms I hadn’t never heard of, such as Chopper Trading, Xr
    Trading Formerly Rho Trading Securities or Wolverine Trading Technologies (all
    from Chicago). One of them, a Houston-based firm, is [Quantlab Financial, LLC](http://www.quantlab.com). I
    quickly googled the name “Quantlab” and I realized the company was not a small
    prop shop at all, and then I found this *Wall Street Journal* [story](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303563304579445381552266144) ($) about
    two former employees of Quantlab accused by the firm of stealing HFT codes then
    used by SXP, the new company co-founded by the two ex-employees and a lawyer (you
    can read [here](http://www.jsonline.com/business/highfrequency-trading-firm-accuses-rival-of-defrauding-customers-155a9ui-151216325.html)
    another article about the case). Since I talked a lot about religion and monks
    in my presentation at the Paris *Market Microstructure* conference, and since
    SXP had its beginnings in a monastery, I decided to download the case records
    through [Pacer](https://www.pacer.gov) in order to learn more about the affair.'

- en: 'I was not disappointed. There are 106 files/1653 pages (FBI interviews, court
    hearings, phone records, etc., with a lot of technical details about HFT, coding,
    co-location, statistical arbitrage, short-term predictions… and Carl Gauss). In
    short, the court files highlight the “black boxes” of high-frequency trading and
    all these pages are gold for who wants to learn a little more about the small
    world of HFT (the alleged theft is not the most interesting part). This case is
    a little old (2007-2008) but that’s interesting because SXP was founded just after
    Reg. NMS was established. I really have to finish the “HFT in my backyard” series,
    so that I could have time to start a new series about monks, arbitrage and HFT.
    “‘*It reads like a John Grisham novel,’ Chicago securities lawyer Andrew Stoltmann,
    who is not involved in the case, [said](http://www.jsonline.com/business/highfrequency-trading-firm-accuses-rival-of-defrauding-customers-155a9ui-151216325.html)
    after reviewing key filings*. ‘*Absolutely incredible.*’” I confirm: this case
    is juste in-cre-di-ble. Merry Christmas!'
