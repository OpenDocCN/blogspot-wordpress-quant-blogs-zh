    mean-reversion performance. This is just common sense, and is strongly supported
    by the research. Another good recap (and great visual) was done by **Jeff Pietsch**
    of the cool new site **ETF Prophet  [http://etfprophet.com/relative-volatility-comparative-mean-reversion-strategy-performance/](http://etfprophet.com/relative-volatility-comparative-mean-reversion-strategy-performance/)**and
    formerly of Market Rewind fame. In this post Jeff shows how a 3-year relative
    ranking of 100-day historical volatility had a substantial impact on a basic RSI2
    strategy. Another series of posts that break things down in a more detailed and
    simple manner that is easy to follow was done by **Woodshedder** [http://ibankcoin.com/woodshedderblog/2010/07/19/part-4-the-secret-ingredient/](http://ibankcoin.com/woodshedderblog/2010/07/19/part-4-the-secret-ingredient/). The
    use of shorter or more complex transforms/measurements of volatility can boost
    separation in mean-reversion returns even more. But that is not the point—in fact,
    the point is that we are using *historical volatility* in some way or another
    to determine what to do right now with our trading.

    mean-reversion strategy by separating the readings into different quartiles or
    quintiles. These can represent different volatility regimes.'

    than market prices using even simple projection models. The use of volatility
    projection models (EGARCH etc) is well established in academia and considered
    to be fairly robust.'
