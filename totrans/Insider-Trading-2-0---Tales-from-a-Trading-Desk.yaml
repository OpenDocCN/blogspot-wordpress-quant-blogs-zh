    our markets are becoming too focused on catering to them,” said **Attorney General
    Schneiderman**. “I am committed to cracking down on fundamentally unfair – and
    potentially illegal – arrangements that give elite groups of traders early access
    to market-moving information at the expense of the rest of the market.  We call
    it Insider Trading 2.0, and it is one of the greatest threats to public confidence
    in the markets.  It’s long past time that we focus on structural reforms to help
    eliminate the unfair advantages enjoyed by high-frequency traders.”
