    One does not see, say, physicists spending much (any?) of their time defending

    a theory that almost all scientists believe is 100% true, many scientists spend

    unpopularity: applying it to explaining all life via the first prokaryote (no)
    and applying it to humans (yes). The more we learn about intracellular molecular
    biology, the more complex it becomes. Cellular machines have dozens of proteins,
    with logistic systems for building and supplying it, so that the functioning parts
    involve a complex system of necessary components. The response to this ''irreducable
    complexity'' argument is that the prior forms of any complex working tissue or
    organelle could have been very different, and we can''t know exactly what it function
    was, but they are theoretically possible, such as the assertion that lungs were
    probably first air bladders in marine animals. Different function, same proto-organ.
    But its one thing to say proteins A through F appear in other cells, quite another
    to explain how they transmogrified, step by step, to a totally new function. If
    they existed in a particular useful constellation, moving them to a totally new
    cellular function is like the Towers of Hanoi puzzle, where every plate must be
    moved following the logic that plates can only lie on top of larger plates. The
    constraint that all discs must be on a larger disc is like the contraint that
    every move must not decrease the organism''s fitness, and turns a simple problem
    into one that becomes insanely complex as the number of plates increase. That
    is, evolution is blind, and each change in genes via reshuffling and mutation
    can''t kill the host, which is a strong constraint because most mutations with
    effect are harmful.'

    where k is the number of discs. Assuming the survivability constraint is analogous,
    moving a complex cellular machine from say a set of 8 proteins that performs cellular
    secretion of toxins (Ken Miller's Type III secretory system), to a set of 20 proteins
    which act in concert with all sorts of supply chains (Behe's bacteria flagellum),
    takes an insanely large number of steps because each step needs to not kill the
    genetic vehicle. As proteins conservatively have about 100 amino acids each, this
    means 2000 amino acids. Each amino acid needs three different base codes, so that's
    6000 DNA letters. If the mutations occurred only at this level of the DNA, it
    would involve on the order of 2^6000 moves to get from function A to function
    B, a number greater than 1E500\. A modern evolutionary theorist would say, this
    number is big, but so is the number of organisms and things they could change
    into, and planets in the universe. True enough, but all these numbers are so large,
    I think its at least just as likely that evolution's probability of success is
    effectively zero, as opposed to one. As one can't really quantify these things
    (what is the state space of potential organelles that a Type III secretory system
    could be?), I think arguing too hard about one side being certainly true is difficult.
    I have never seen quantitative estimates by Darwinists, just hard waving about
    possible ways things could have arisen, as opposed to actual numbers and probabilities.

    productive. Why are people who live towards the equator darker skinned that those
    at the pole (melanomas and vitamin D)? Why do some groups develop greater ability
    to digest milk (raising cattle for milk is more efficient than merely eating them)?
    It is absurd to think all these biological differences among humans are confined
    to unimportant things, and so we just have different culture to explain substantive
    differences between races. As if black Africans have a culture that appears to
    really value sprinting, and so it follows in the African diaspora. Kids everywhere

    the beneficial evolutionary effects of one copy of this gene. Yet, this same logic,

    this criticism might be taken seriously. Yet even though it is important to understand
    the motivations and pretexts of your adversaries, it is not true that just because
    a view is sometimes, or even often, a pretext, that it has no credence. Further,
    my interest in biology and the history of life is actually increased thinking
    about the mystery, because it seems like a big unsolved mystery. For example,
    the DNA folds in a particular way so that certain regions of the DNA are physically
    close even though very far away in the sequence. How is this folding pattern regulated
    in the DNA? The idea that evolution is necessary as a motivation for scientific
    inquiry is simply absurd, because regardless of how life got here, it is interesting
    to know how it works.

    incremental blind mutation, compounded with natural selection, to be so small
    it is implausibly the mechanism. I would like to see estimates of the state space
    of mutations that take a nematode to a lizard via molecular mutations. That is,
    within a factor of E20, how many mutations were needed to get from prokaryotes
    to dogs? How many times has this been tried? But like Global Warming advocates
    who insist the debate is over, for the Darwinists merely engaging this kind of
    question cedes too much credibility to their critics, so all they do is sneer,
    note homologies between species, discuss micro evolution (finch beaks, genetic
    drift in bacteria), and that this has been tried so many times in the universe
    it does not matter how improbable it is because Infinity times any positive probability
    generates a certainty. But surely some alien designer surely would have homologies
    in his toolkit and allow microevolution, and the size and existence of the universe
    is finite, so there are limits to how improbable something can be before we should
    expect it to happen (famously, the monkeys typing randomly would not generate
    Shakespeare's Hamlet given the 14B year age of the universe and a million monkeys--it
    is too improbable).
