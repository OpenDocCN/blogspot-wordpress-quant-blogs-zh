- en: Smallcap action has been poor lately.  Typically you would like to see smallcaps
    offering upside leadership during a rally.  They certainly have not been doing
    that.  Wednesday’s smallcap underperformance was quite outsized and I decided
    to look at other pullback scenarios where the RUT underperformed so badly.  I
    devised the following study.

- en: Instances are very low, which makes it difficult to generate meaningful expectations.
     But somewhat surprisingly results could not be any more bullish.  When I looked
    at the individual instances I noted that four of the six registered 2%+ gains
    over the next 3 days.  Perhaps the smallcap downdraft is exhausting itself and
    the market can manage to rally as it has in the past.
