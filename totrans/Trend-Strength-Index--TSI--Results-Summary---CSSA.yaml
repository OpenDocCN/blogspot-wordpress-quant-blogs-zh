    by Frank Hassler of Engineering Returns: [https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2010/06/28/trend-strength-index-tsi/](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2010/06/28/trend-strength-index-tsi/)
    I will have more to follow on the TSI later this week, but first a peek at the
    results of some tests that Frank ran on the Nasdaq 100 stocks using TSI. You can
    see that depending on a stock’s TSI value, there is a pronounced difference in
    how it responds to different short term trend strategies. High values of TSI are
    highly desirable (above 1.8 or 2) for short-term trend strategies, while low levels
    of TSI are quite poor. The opposite is true for mean-reversion strategies, where
    stocks with TSI values at or less than 1.5 tend to do extremely well with short-term
    mean reversion. In contract, high TSI stocks do very poorly —in fact in our own
    testing, they bankrupted the starting account balance, which is a first!  In nearly
    every case the TSI is superior to the ADX–which is the standard trend filter used
    by most traders. Traders would be well advised to consider the TSI of a stock
    before they make a decision on how they plan to trade it. Deciding otherwise could
    be quite costly. Making the right decision can mean a substantial improvement
    in your trading results.'
