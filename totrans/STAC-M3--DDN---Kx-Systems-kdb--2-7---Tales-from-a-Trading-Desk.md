## STAC-M3: DDN + Kx Systems kdb+ 2.7

Every now and again I appear to end up back at the STAC [site](http://www.stacresearch.com/ddn?q=taxonomy/term/268,3).  This time it due to the kdb+ performance on [DDN](http://www.ddn.com/zh-hans/press-releases/2011/datadirect-networks-ddn-delivers-300-faster-analytics-and-business-intelligence-) hardware.  The interesting this about DDN is that is a marriage of both software and hardware – SFA10K-X storage operating system coupled with RAID dedicated IO channels to Fibre Channel or InfiniBand.  Very cool stuff, and the STAC report provides some nice technical diagrams and data.
