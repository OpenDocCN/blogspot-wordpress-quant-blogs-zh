    quantitative investing. My contention has always been that momentum strategies
    are generally less reliable than mean-reversal strategies. (See

    with the highest returns in, say, the last 12 months, short the ones with the
    lowest returns, and hold for, say, 1 month. If you run this strategy for the top
    100 UK stocks from 1900 to 2007, the average annualized return before costs is
    about 10%.'

- en: First, it is very transaction-costly to implement momentum strategies for small
    or even mid-cap stocks. If you factor in costs, 10% can easily become 5% -- not
    an impressive number even for a dollar-neutral strategy. (Though one should note
    that the infrequent rebalancing renders transaction costs consideration less important.)

    This is not acceptable performance for many hedge funds. Such lengthy drawdowns
    have been a common feature of many momentum strategies that I have personally
    studied and traded.

    has stopped working altogether for the US market, while continuing to deliver
    positive returns in other markets!

    Momentum strategies generally derive their power from the slow diffusion and analysis
    of information: if all investors are simultaneously aware of all the relevant
    financial information about a company and can analyze the significance of the
    information instantaneously, they will have come to a consensus fair market value
    instantaneously and no momentum in the price will result. Hence perhaps the disappearance
    of momentum in the US equity market means what most people know already: that
    it is the most efficient equity market of all.'
