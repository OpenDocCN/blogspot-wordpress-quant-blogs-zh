## Insider Trading 2.0

> “Rather than curbing the worst threats posed by high-frequency [traders](http://www.ag.ny.gov/press-release/ag-schneiderman-calls-new-efforts-eliminate-unfair-advantages-provided-trading-venues), our markets are becoming too focused on catering to them,” said **Attorney General Schneiderman**. “I am committed to cracking down on fundamentally unfair – and potentially illegal – arrangements that give elite groups of traders early access to market-moving information at the expense of the rest of the market.  We call it Insider Trading 2.0, and it is one of the greatest threats to public confidence in the markets.  It’s long past time that we focus on structural reforms to help eliminate the unfair advantages enjoyed by high-frequency traders.”
