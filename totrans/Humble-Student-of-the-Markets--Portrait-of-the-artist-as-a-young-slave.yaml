    most bright students do not have any collateral and cannot easily pledge their
    future income. Yet the venture-capital industry has shown that the private sector
    can do a good job at financing new ventures with no collateral. So why can’t they
    finance bright students?'

    exchange for their capital, the investors would receive a fraction of a student’s
    future income — or, even better, a fraction of the increase in her income that
    derives from college attendance. (This increase can be easily calculated as the
    difference between the actual income and the average income of high school graduates
    in the same area.)

    faced with crushing debt sold themselves, or their children, into slavery. How
    is this any different? The Zingales proposal asks a student to sell their future
    earnings, or equity if you will, in exchange for cash to finance their education.
    OK, it''s not full slavery in that someone owns all of you, but it is a partial
    form of slavery. Zingales qualfiied his proposal to state that it is not "indentured
    servitude":'

    decisions about your life. If you want to specialize in Architecture, Journalism
    or the Liberal Arts because that's your passion, go for it! On the other hand,
    you need to manage your own expectations. If you graduate with a degree in Victorian
    literature or foreign affairs, don't complan when you get your dream job of working
    for an NGO that pays you 30K a years - because you made your own choice to go
    into the field of your own volition. There are tradeoffs in life and you made
    one.
