- en: With little notable action today I thought I’d write up the next part of my
    study on gaps during uptrends vs. downtrends. Last week I looked at mid-sized
    gaps up. Tonight I will look at mid-sized gaps down. As a refresher, a mid-sized
    gap is defined as a an opening between o.25% and 0.75% away from yesterdays close.
    A long-term uptrned is defined as a close above the 200-day moving average and
    a long-term downtrend is defined as a close below the 200-day moving average.

- en: I looked at 3631 trading days going back to 11/17/93\. Of those there were 368
    mid-sized gaps down in uptrends and 222 mid-sized gaps down in downtrends.

    would have resulted in 177(48%) winners and in total gained 8.5% over the 368
    trades. On a per-trade basis that’s 0.02% - basically break even. Of those gaps
    down 213 (57%) filled at some point during the day. (A fill in this case is defined
    as a move back up to the previous day’s close.)

- en: Buying at the open and selling at the close when the market was in a downtrend
    would have been profitable 98 (44%) times and LOST you almost 32% over 222 trades.
    Per trade that’s about a 0.14% loss on average from open to close. Of those mid-sized
    gaps down, 152 (68.5%) filled at some point during the day.

- en: I previously showed that large gaps down in downtrends typically represented
    an intraday buying opportunity as they had a large positive expectancy. Mid-sized
    gaps do not act the same at all. They contain a negative expectancy. Interestingly,
    although a good percentage of them fill, they also generally fail. Fading the
    open could be one play. Another could be looking for a short entry after the gap
    fills.

    when deciding how to approach a gap opening: 1) Long-term trend of the market.
    2) The size of the gap. They both matter.'
