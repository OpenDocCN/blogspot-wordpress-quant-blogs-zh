- en: I cannot pretend to be a pioneer in cycle research, but I do know that there
    is a high degree of conceptual appeal and actual validity substantiated by my
    own results to this approach. The new set of adaptive indicators are forthcoming
    on Monday for the release of our **DV Indicators Excel Plug-in.** This power tool
    is for serious researchers and traders or just for people who don’t have standard
    platforms like Tradestation or Amibroker. The plug-in will feature all the old
    and new DV Indicators as well as this whole new class of self-adapting indicators
    and “cycle-shifters.” This “Level 1” adaptation is the next generation of indicators
    and the plug-in will be the ideal delivery mechanism for Level 2 and 3.

    on the chin recently and investigated the possibility that short-term mean-reversion
    was waning:  [http://marketsci.wordpress.com/2010/04/06/the-death-of-short-term-mean-reversion/](http://marketsci.wordpress.com/2010/04/06/the-death-of-short-term-mean-reversion/) 
    His conclusion was that this is a temporary anomaly and that mean-reversion is
    here to stay– I completely agree on this point. However, since all of the DV oscillators
    have been doing very well lately, I decided that I might try to explain the strange
    divergence. [https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2010/03/29/iron-chef-battle-oscillator-rsi2-and-dv-spy/](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2010/03/29/iron-chef-battle-oscillator-rsi2-and-dv-spy/)  
    ***In truth the reality is that the market has not really changed in mean-reversion character
    so much as it has shifted cycles–that is the length of time required to complete
    a mean-reversion type trade is increasing.*** (note that this is not as useful
    of a moderating factor in follow-through or trend type markets). This is a function
    of volatility decreasing, and is even more exacerbated by the fact that the momentum/trend
    is increasing at a higher than normal rate. For DV Oscillators, this is somewhat
    less of an issue since they re-scale to current market volatility by self-adjustment.
    However for static measures, it might be instructive to question whether a 1-day
    cycle that is typical of reverse daily follow-through and also highly correlated
    to binary RSI2 is simply too short for these market conditions?'

    and momentum. But instead of focusing on being concerned with filtering long or
    short trades, the long-term trend can be used to filter for changes in the cycle
    length. In this case, one simple change makes a big difference. Below is the performance
    of regular reverse daily follow through (long on down days, short on up days)
    and the performance of 2-day reverse daily follow through (long if the two day
    performance is negative and short if positive) depending on the long-term trend
    as defined by the 50 day sma relative to the 200 day sma (aka the Golden Crossover).
    The test run below was on the S&P500 index (^GSPC) over the last 3000 bars which
    is more reliable for close to close strategies (pointed out by MarketSci).

- en: As you can see when the long-term trend is DOWN, the standard reverse daily
    follow through approach is vastly superior in absolute and risk-adjusted returns
    to the two-day follow through strategy. However, when the long-term trend is UP,
    the two-day reverse follow-through strategy is superior in both respects. Note
    that most combinations of longer reverse-follow through lengths and/or indicators
     have performed more consistently when the long-term trend is UP. The only logical
    explanation for this is that the cycle lengths increase as a function of lower
    volatility and more consistent momentum/trend. The solution is clearly to shift
    to longer cycles in this environment.
