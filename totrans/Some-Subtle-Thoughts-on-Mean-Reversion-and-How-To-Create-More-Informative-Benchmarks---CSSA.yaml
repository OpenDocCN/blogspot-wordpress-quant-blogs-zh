- en: Michael Stokes who does excellent work over at MarketSci  [http://marketsci.wordpress.com/](http://marketsci.wordpress.com/)
    publishes a very interesting report on the “State of Mean-Reversion.” Equally
    interesting is work done by Jez Liberty at Automated Trading Systems [http://www.automated-trading-system.com/](http://www.automated-trading-system.com/)
    on the complementary “State of Trend Following.” Both of these reports aim to
    capture an “effect” via  the performance of similar or correlated strategies.
    The logic is that such benchmarks should reveal important information at a “20,000
    foot level” towards the relative effectiveness of a given style. I am not writing
    this post to disparage/criticize the excellent work of these bloggers (and Michael
    especially since this considers mean-reversion only), but rather wish to point
    out how the benchmarks themselves can create issues in interpretation in ways
    that are analogous to any type of index product. Some of these issues are so subtle–
    such as the “rebalancing bonus”  that they deserve their own post. For now, it
    is important to consider some subtle thoughts on the “philosophy” of mean-reversion
    as it is often referred to in the blogosphere. In my opinion, there are some layers
    beneath the onion that many readers have likely taken for granted–or failed to
    consider.

- en: 'Ultimately what most of us think of as “mean-reversion” is quite semantic but
    not necessarily interchangeable. I will spare readers from making a specific definition
    at this point, but rather mention that it is overly simplistic to have one strategy
    be representative of a group or constitute the baseline benchmark for an effect
    like mean-reversion.  For example, “daily follow-through” or the reverse seems
    to be the de facto benchmark for most traders as representative of mean-reversion
    (note that the State of Mean-Reversion is more balanced). In my opinion, daily
    follow through (or reverse daily follow through as I like to call it) is NOT per
    se mean-reversion by my thinking. This reflects a more recent evolution in my
    thinking towards looking at **conditional outcomes of specific features of classification**.
    In this case, a daily follow through strategy has features that are different
    from say an indicator and such differences are not readily obvious. As a consequence,
    the observed performance (or recent lack therof) of such a strategy as “daily
    follow through” does not appropriately lead to a linear set of conclusions. The
    confusion doesn’t stop there:  *mean-reversion can still exist profitably at the
    daily level without conforming to a pattern of positive days leading to negative
    days and vice versa. Furthermore, the existence of a profitable strategy that
    fades positive/negative days need not necessarily imply strong mean reversion.
    Much of this discrepancy can relate to non-linearity in decile/quantile/quartile/median/average
    behavior in measuring a given effect.* In addition, the presence of outliers that
    tend to occur in high/low volatility or very strong/weak trends can bias various
    backtest lengths. The environment has a strong conditional effect on the micro-observation
    of the 1-day lagged performance. Also  the persistence of incorrect signals for
    long versus short signals as a function of going against the trend can also obscure
    what is actually going on. That is, long/cash is very different than long/short,
    and the profitability/losses of one side (ie short) can mask the profitability/losses
    of the other side (ie long).'

- en: 'At the indicator level,  it is difficult to paint things with the same brush
    as they too can measure different things, and can have widely diverging performance
    at times as a function of those differences. The DV2  or DVB indicator had remarkable
    performance in 2010 while other “mean-reversion” strategies suffered– to hail
    its superiority as a mean-reversion indicator would be foolish and self-serving
    but more importantly it also obscures the point: *The DVB or DV2 measures a distribution
    of relative range (close vs high/low) and is not always a mean-reversion indicator!*
    The DVB/DV2  has a tendency to adapt to the current environment and because it
    does not care about the relative close, it  often signals going long on up days
    as well as short on down days. This creates substantial “tracking error” to any
    benchmark such as daily follow through that looks for example at the binary pattern
    of closing prices over the last two days. The RSI2 also need not be a mean-reversion
    indicator– in this case because it has very different behavior at a binary level
    (50/50) versus extremes, and also has very different behavior as a function of
    time spent at extremes. The RSI is more closely related to daily follow through,
    yet because of these properties as well as a 2-day parameter, it can also generate
    material tracking error to such a benchmark. The RSI is also a multi-faceted tool
    that can be used in for example the reverse direction for strongly trending markets.
    In other words, high readings can function more accurately as a trend signal–especially
    in commodities. This negates the stereotype that it must function as a pure mean-reversion
    indicator. The parameter length of the aforementioned examples in itself is ambiguous
    as it suggests that mean-reversion is defined by a given lookback–in this case
    shorter-term. Also missing in this discussion is the profitability or derivative
    of the strategy–that is conditional performance matters.'

- en: 'To complicate matters even more, the discussion of volatility filters and related
    measures and their linkage to mean-reversion performance can further obscure the
    ultimate goal (the subject of the next post). So lets take a step back and consider
    what we are trying to accomplish. The nuances of “mean-reversion” are truly never-ending-one
    must understand the calculations of indicators and their concurrent assumptions/drawbacks
    to understand why things succeed or fail to work. Lets take the RSI2 as a very
    basic example. The RSI2 is merely an oscillator that captures a relative measurement
    of the close to close point moves up versus the point moves down. That is, it
    does not consider the open, the low or the high.  Through the process of re-scaling,
    this measure is normalized (albeit more akin  to forced nonlinear compression)
    between 0 and 100\. The RSI has some advantages and disadvantages, first the good:
    1) it is very sensitive and tends to move coincident with price 2) it is a more
    normalized measure than using either point moves or returns in the sense that
    moves are considered in a relative sense versus a pure absolute sense. This makes
    it easier to create standardized trading rules.  Now the bad: 1) RSI values are
    still somewhat absolute, and the distribution of values can change over time such
    that extreme readings become even more infrequent and vice versa, especially as
    the environment changes (think 2009). 2) one implicitly assumes using an RSI that
    close to close movements are a stationary and valuable predictor of future reversion–
    in fact, the relative importance of momentum (close to close) versus range (close
    versus highs and lows) can shift over both short and long periods of time. They
    can also have complex interacting effects. An example would be RSI-DV2 divergence,
    or the diverging performance of the indicators in isolation as a tool for analysis.
    There is little point in continuing to list the oddities or discrepancies that
    exist. The point is that mean-reversion is a highly nuanced topic—and cannot be
    taken advantage of effectively without gaining a deeper understanding of the details.
     Perhaps this post is somewhat similar to the movies that end without a clear
    resolution– such films require the viewer to do some thinking after the fact or
    have an imagination concerning the possible outcomes. If this post helps you to
    do the latter in the appropriate context, then you will find yourself become a
    better system developer–and even a better discretionary trader than uses technical
    indicators.'
