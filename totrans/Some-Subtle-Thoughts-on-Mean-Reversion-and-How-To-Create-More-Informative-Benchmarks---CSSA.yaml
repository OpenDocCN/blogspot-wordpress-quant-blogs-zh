- en: Michael Stokes who does excellent work over at MarketSci  [http://marketsci.wordpress.com/](http://marketsci.wordpress.com/)
    publishes a very interesting report on the “State of Mean-Reversion.” Equally
    interesting is work done by Jez Liberty at Automated Trading Systems [http://www.automated-trading-system.com/](http://www.automated-trading-system.com/)
    on the complementary “State of Trend Following.” Both of these reports aim to
    capture an “effect” via  the performance of similar or correlated strategies.
    The logic is that such benchmarks should reveal important information at a “20,000
    foot level” towards the relative effectiveness of a given style. I am not writing
    this post to disparage/criticize the excellent work of these bloggers (and Michael
    especially since this considers mean-reversion only), but rather wish to point
    out how the benchmarks themselves can create issues in interpretation in ways
    that are analogous to any type of index product. Some of these issues are so subtle–
    such as the “rebalancing bonus”  that they deserve their own post. For now, it
    is important to consider some subtle thoughts on the “philosophy” of mean-reversion
    as it is often referred to in the blogosphere. In my opinion, there are some layers
    beneath the onion that many readers have likely taken for granted–or failed to
    consider.

  zh: 迈克尔·斯托克斯（Michael Stokes）在MarketSci网站上[http://marketsci.wordpress.com/](http://marketsci.wordpress.com/)做了出色的工作，他发布了一份关于“均值回归状态”的非常有趣的研究报告。同样有趣的是，Jez
    Liberty在自动化交易系统[http://www.automated-trading-system.com/](http://www.automated-trading-system.com/)所做的关于互补的“趋势跟随状态”的研究。这两份报告都旨在通过类似或相关策略的性能来捕捉某种“效应”。这样的逻辑是，这样的基准应该能在“20,000英尺的高度”揭示有关给定风格相对有效性的重要信息。我写这篇文章并不是为了贬低/批评这些博主（尤其是迈克尔，因为这里只考虑均值回归）的优秀工作，而是想指出基准本身如何在与任何类型的指数产品相似的方式下创造解释上的问题。其中一些问题是如此微妙——比如“再平衡奖金”，它们值得单独的一篇文章。现在，考虑在博客圈经常提到的“均值回归哲学”上的一些微妙想法是很重要的。在我看来，许多读者可能认为这是理所当然的——或者没有考虑过——但这背后还有许多层次。
- en: 'Ultimately what most of us think of as “mean-reversion” is quite semantic but
    not necessarily interchangeable. I will spare readers from making a specific definition
    at this point, but rather mention that it is overly simplistic to have one strategy
    be representative of a group or constitute the baseline benchmark for an effect
    like mean-reversion.  For example, “daily follow-through” or the reverse seems
    to be the de facto benchmark for most traders as representative of mean-reversion
    (note that the State of Mean-Reversion is more balanced). In my opinion, daily
    follow through (or reverse daily follow through as I like to call it) is NOT per
    se mean-reversion by my thinking. This reflects a more recent evolution in my
    thinking towards looking at **conditional outcomes of specific features of classification**.
    In this case, a daily follow through strategy has features that are different
    from say an indicator and such differences are not readily obvious. As a consequence,
    the observed performance (or recent lack therof) of such a strategy as “daily
    follow through” does not appropriately lead to a linear set of conclusions. The
    confusion doesn’t stop there:  *mean-reversion can still exist profitably at the
    daily level without conforming to a pattern of positive days leading to negative
    days and vice versa. Furthermore, the existence of a profitable strategy that
    fades positive/negative days need not necessarily imply strong mean reversion.
    Much of this discrepancy can relate to non-linearity in decile/quantile/quartile/median/average
    behavior in measuring a given effect.* In addition, the presence of outliers that
    tend to occur in high/low volatility or very strong/weak trends can bias various
    backtest lengths. The environment has a strong conditional effect on the micro-observation
    of the 1-day lagged performance. Also  the persistence of incorrect signals for
    long versus short signals as a function of going against the trend can also obscure
    what is actually going on. That is, long/cash is very different than long/short,
    and the profitability/losses of one side (ie short) can mask the profitability/losses
    of the other side (ie long).'

  zh: 最终，我们大多数人认为的“均值回归”实际上是一种语义上的理解，并不一定可以互换。在此阶段，我将避免读者做出具体的定义，而是提到，用一个策略来代表一个群体或构成均值回归效应的基准线实在是过于简单化了。例如，“日常跟进”或其反面似乎是大多数交易员用来代表均值回归的默认标准（需要注意的是，均值回归的状态更加平衡）。在我看来，日常跟进（或者我更愿意称之为反向日常跟进）本身并不是我的理解中的均值回归。这反映了我对观察分类特定特征的条件的思考的最新演变。在这种情况下，日常跟进策略的特点与指示器不同，这些差异并不是一目了然的。因此，观察到的“日常跟进”策略的表现（或最近的缺乏表现）并不能恰当地导致一系列线性结论。混淆并没有就此停止：*均值回归可以在不遵循正负交易日模式的情况下，在每日层面上仍然获利。此外，存在一个获利策略，该策略在消退正/负日期的同时，并不一定意味着强烈的均值回归。这种差异很大程度上与测量给定效应时，十分位数/四分位数/中位数/平均数行为的非线性有关。*
    此外，极端值往往出现在高/低波动性或非常强/弱的趋势中，可能会偏见各种回测长度。环境对1天滞后性能的微观测有很强的条件效应。此外，当逆势操作时，长期与短期信号的持续错误信号也会模糊实际发生的情况。也就是说，做多/持币与做多/做空非常不同，一方面（即做空）的盈利/亏损可能会掩盖另一方面（即做多）的盈利/亏损。
- en: 'At the indicator level,  it is difficult to paint things with the same brush
    as they too can measure different things, and can have widely diverging performance
    at times as a function of those differences. The DV2  or DVB indicator had remarkable
    performance in 2010 while other “mean-reversion” strategies suffered– to hail
    its superiority as a mean-reversion indicator would be foolish and self-serving
    but more importantly it also obscures the point: *The DVB or DV2 measures a distribution
    of relative range (close vs high/low) and is not always a mean-reversion indicator!*
    The DVB/DV2  has a tendency to adapt to the current environment and because it
    does not care about the relative close, it  often signals going long on up days
    as well as short on down days. This creates substantial “tracking error” to any
    benchmark such as daily follow through that looks for example at the binary pattern
    of closing prices over the last two days. The RSI2 also need not be a mean-reversion
    indicator– in this case because it has very different behavior at a binary level
    (50/50) versus extremes, and also has very different behavior as a function of
    time spent at extremes. The RSI is more closely related to daily follow through,
    yet because of these properties as well as a 2-day parameter, it can also generate
    material tracking error to such a benchmark. The RSI is also a multi-faceted tool
    that can be used in for example the reverse direction for strongly trending markets.
    In other words, high readings can function more accurately as a trend signal–especially
    in commodities. This negates the stereotype that it must function as a pure mean-reversion
    indicator. The parameter length of the aforementioned examples in itself is ambiguous
    as it suggests that mean-reversion is defined by a given lookback–in this case
    shorter-term. Also missing in this discussion is the profitability or derivative
    of the strategy–that is conditional performance matters.'

  zh: 在指标层面，很难一概而论，因为不同的指标可以衡量不同的事物，有时根据这些差异，它们的性能可能会有很大差异。DV2或DVB指标在2010年表现出色，而其他“均值回归”策略则遭受损失——将它的优越性视为一个均值回归指标是愚蠢和自私的，但更重要的是，这也模糊了重点：*DVB或DV2衡量的是相对范围（收盘价与高/低价）的分布，它并不总是一个均值回归指标！*
    DVB/DV2倾向于适应当前环境，因为它不在乎相对的收盘价，所以它经常在上涨的日子发出做多信号，在下跌的日子发出做空信号。这 creates a substantial
    “tracking error” to any benchmark such as daily follow through that looks at the
    binary pattern of closing prices over the last two days. The RSI2 also need not
    be a mean-reversion indicator– in this case because it has very different behavior
    at a binary level (50/50) versus extremes, and also has very different behavior
    as a function of time spent at extremes. The RSI is more closely related to daily

    is defined by a given lookback–in this case shorter-term. Also missing in this
    discussion is the profitability or derivative of the strategy–that is conditional
    performance matters.
- en: 'To complicate matters even more, the discussion of volatility filters and related
    measures and their linkage to mean-reversion performance can further obscure the
    ultimate goal (the subject of the next post). So lets take a step back and consider
    what we are trying to accomplish. The nuances of “mean-reversion” are truly never-ending-one
    must understand the calculations of indicators and their concurrent assumptions/drawbacks
    to understand why things succeed or fail to work. Lets take the RSI2 as a very
    basic example. The RSI2 is merely an oscillator that captures a relative measurement
    of the close to close point moves up versus the point moves down. That is, it
    does not consider the open, the low or the high.  Through the process of re-scaling,
    this measure is normalized (albeit more akin  to forced nonlinear compression)
    between 0 and 100\. The RSI has some advantages and disadvantages, first the good:
    1) it is very sensitive and tends to move coincident with price 2) it is a more
    normalized measure than using either point moves or returns in the sense that
    moves are considered in a relative sense versus a pure absolute sense. This makes
    it easier to create standardized trading rules.  Now the bad: 1) RSI values are
    still somewhat absolute, and the distribution of values can change over time such
    that extreme readings become even more infrequent and vice versa, especially as
    the environment changes (think 2009). 2) one implicitly assumes using an RSI that
    close to close movements are a stationary and valuable predictor of future reversion–
    in fact, the relative importance of momentum (close to close) versus range (close
    versus highs and lows) can shift over both short and long periods of time. They
    can also have complex interacting effects. An example would be RSI-DV2 divergence,
    or the diverging performance of the indicators in isolation as a tool for analysis.
    There is little point in continuing to list the oddities or discrepancies that
    exist. The point is that mean-reversion is a highly nuanced topic—and cannot be
    taken advantage of effectively without gaining a deeper understanding of the details.
     Perhaps this post is somewhat similar to the movies that end without a clear
    resolution– such films require the viewer to do some thinking after the fact or
    have an imagination concerning the possible outcomes. If this post helps you to
    do the latter in the appropriate context, then you will find yourself become a
    better system developer–and even a better discretionary trader than uses technical
    indicators.'

  zh: 为了使问题更加复杂，讨论波动率过滤器和相关指标及其与均值回归性能的联系可能会进一步模糊最终目标（这是下一篇文章的主题）。所以让我们退一步，考虑一下我们试图实现什么。均值回归的细微差别确实是无穷无尽的——一个人必须理解指标的计算及其同时假设/缺点，才能理解为什么事情成功或失败。让我们以RSI2为例。RSI2只是一个振荡器，它捕捉的是收盘到收盘点的上升与下降的相对测量。也就是说，它并不考虑开盘价、最低价或最高价。通过重新缩放的过程，这个测量被标准化（尽管更类似于强制非线性压缩）在0到100之间。RSI有一些优点和缺点，首先说优点：1)它非常敏感，倾向于与价格同步变动2)它比使用点移动或回报更正常化，因为它考虑的是相对移动而不是纯粹的绝对移动。这使得创建标准化交易规则变得更容易。现在谈谈缺点：1)
    RSI值仍然是相对绝对的，随着时间的推移，值的分布可能会改变，使得极端读数变得更加稀少，反之亦然，尤其是在环境发生变化时（想想2009年）。2) 使用RSI隐含地假设收盘到收盘的移动是一个平稳且宝贵的未来均值回归预测器——实际上，动量（收盘到收盘）与范围（收盘价与最高价和最低价）的相对重要性可以在短期和长期内发生变化。它们也可能有复杂的相互作用效果。一个例子就是RSI-DV2背离，或者指标在孤立使用时背离的性能。继续列举存在的古怪之处或偏差没有多大意义。重点是均值回归是一个高度细微的话题——在没有深入了解细节的情况下，无法有效利用。也许这篇文章有点像那些没有清晰结局的电影——这样的电影需要观众在事后进行一些思考，或者对可能的结局有所想象。如果这篇文章能帮助你在适当的背景下做后者，那么你会发现自己成为一个更好的系统开发者——甚至是一个比使用技术指标更好的主观交易员。
