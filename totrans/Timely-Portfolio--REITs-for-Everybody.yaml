    The beta chasers’ demand has driven prices to significantly overvalued levels

- en: As a quick break from my quantstrat fun [A Quantstrat to Build on Part 5](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2011/06/quantstrat-to-build-on-part-5.html),
    I thought I would try to replicate in R some of the fine work done by [The Aleph
    Blog](http://alephblog.com) on REITs [How to Make More Returns on REITs](http://alephblog.com/2011/06/04/how-to-make-more-returns-on-reits/
    "Permanent Link to How to Make More Returns on REITs").  Unfortunately, I will
    not be able to finish before I head home for the weekend, so I will just show
    the start of the project in this post and hope to finish this weekend or Monday.
