    Murray Coleman of Barron’s tipped me off to a new ETN [filing](http://sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/831001/000119312510242483/d424b2.htm)
    from Citigroup for the C-Tracks Citi Volatility Index ETN, which has been assigned
    the ticker [CVOL](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/CVOL).

    as index sponsor. The Index is published by the Chicago Board Options Exchange
    (the “CBOE”) and is a measure of directional exposure to the implied volatility
    of large-cap U.S. stocks. As a total return index, the value of the Index on any
    day also includes daily accrued interest on the hypothetical notional value of
    the Index based on the 3-month U.S Treasury rate and reinvestment into the Index.
    The methodology of the Index is designed to produce daily returns that are correlated
    to the CBOE Volatility Index (the “VIX Index”), which is another measure of implied
    volatility of large-cap U.S. stocks. However, the Index is not the VIX Index,
    and returns on each of these indices may differ substantially.”*'

    ETN, I am very much looking forward to its launch and firmly believe that it will
    provide the basis for some very interesting volatility trading opportunities,
    both on its own or in combination with VXX and VXZ.
