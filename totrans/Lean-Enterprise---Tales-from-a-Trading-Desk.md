# Lean Enterprise | Tales from a Trading Desk

> 来源：[https://mdavey.wordpress.com/2015/02/11/lean-enterprise/#0001-01-01](https://mdavey.wordpress.com/2015/02/11/lean-enterprise/#0001-01-01)

## Lean Enterprise

Got my hands on “Lean Enterprise: How High Performance Organizations Innovate at Scale” [recently](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Lean-Enterprise-Performance-Organizations-Innovate/dp/1449368425).  Found it a dry read.  However, the book has some classic comments:

> The purpose of an organization is to enable ordinary human beings to do extraordinary things – Peter Drucker
> 
> Shareholder value is the dumbest idea in the world…[it is[ a result, not a strategy…Your main constituencies are your employees, your customers, and your products. – Jack Welch

Page 31, “establishing and trying to maintain effective communication within large teams consumes enormous amounts of capacity on large projects” – so so true.

Page 33, “As we execute the project, we discover new information – but since nobody wants their features cut, new information generally leads to move work, which is known as “scope creep””

Page 49, Minimum Viable Product – an experiment designed to maximize learning from potential early adopters with minimum effort.

Page 210, “CEOs can talk and blab all day about culture, but the employees know who the jerks are.” – Jack Welch
