    of life on Earth. I don’t believe in God, but I also think the probability of
    cellular life is so small, that I just don’t think random mutation plus selection
    gets us there, and my lack of alternative doesn''t mean I should believe the current
    theory. It’s one thing to turn off a protein (sickle cell anemia), or select for
    the length a finch''s nose, or basically modify an existing structure into various
    subspecies, which really only takes a couple of flips in the genetic sequence,
    quite another to create new tissue.'

    in a specific order, each of which needs at least 20 and probably 400 amino acids
    in a specific order, and a specific rotation. This structure is needed for selection
    to guide random mutations--prior to this, natural selection merely destroys. When
    you listen to the current contenders for how this happened, it’s basically the
    same ‘a miracle happened’ hand waving no matter which side you are on (the most
    specific Darwinistic theory offered is that they arose from 'backs of crystals').

- en: showing that he could create a couple of amino acids from methane, hydrogen,
    ammonia and water, has proven a dead end. You can create some amino acids, and
    these are also found in meteorites, but then, they need to be assembled into proteins,
    and then the proteins into a compound. Further, submarine volcanic vents don't
    make organic compounds, they decompose them. Indeed, these vents are one of the
    limiting factors on what organic compounds can be created in the primitive oceans.
    At the present time, the entire ocean gets cycled through those vents every 10
    million years. So all of the organic compounds get zapped every ten million years.
    That places a constraint on how much organic material you can get via merely simmering.

    odds at 20%, which I thought was great, because usually the number is 1%, 99%,
    or 50%). Anyone who programs writes new code by copying and pasting, or opening
    and saving, old code. Thus the fact that organisms appear to have a common progenitor
    is merely from lazy (ie, all) programmers [note to Telluride Asset Management
    lawyers reading this—that means all my Telluride code is from prior experience,
    which I look forward to showing to a jury—I did not invent the ‘do while’ loop
    at Telluride]. So the fact that humans appear to have common ancestry, just means
    that a resource constrained creator (a design team in the 10-th dimension), merely
    borrowed a lot of code, or had a template library, and the lower the level of
    borrowing determines the taxonomic relation. This also explains why there are
    lots of inefficiencies in code: the great designer is not omniscient and omnipotent,
    he just has a resource constraint and technology team that makes Google look like
    a nematode, large but still finite. Like my programs, genetic instructions are
    a kluge.'

- en: But in the movie I found the performance of Richard Dawkins, atheist extraordinaire,
    most refreshing. First, because he is so honest. He doesn’t say evolution has
    ‘absolutely nothing to do with religion’ as many like to presume, but rather,
    it profoundly impacts one view of religion. I’m not religious myself, so that
    implication doesn’t really affect me, but I do think many people’s views on religion
    are decided by evolution or vice versa. Indeed, the subtext is that not believing
    in God can lead to Nazi atrocities, about as likely as believing against Darwinism
    as explaining all life leads to bible-thumping homophobia. But most importantly,
    Dawkins said while he thinks Intelligent Design is not science, he would entertain
    that life on Earth was seeded from aliens, his only concern being those aliens
    (or the aliens who seeded them) at some point were primordial ooze. In that way,
    my creationism is perfectly consistent with a type Dawkins would allow.

    and anti-empirical nature of religion. Again, I agree with him. But I just don’t
    buy the current Darwinism that waves its hand and says the complexity of eukaryotes
    is merely a sequence of random plus selection.

    Michail Behe argued against Darwinistic explanation of the bacterial flagellum,
    which Kenneth Miller from Brown argued against Behe's argument. The flagellum
    involves a constellation of 50 parts very much like an outboard motor, with a
    rotor, engine, etc. It seems improbable these things arranged together by natural
    selection. Miller

- en: that several of the component (ie, proteins) of the flagellum have ‘directly
    homologous’ proteins that have other purposes ('Directly homologous' is like 'kinda
    isomorphic'). One, for example, is used as a secretory system in some bacteria,
    allowing or disallowing various specific toxins. But I found this proof very unconvincing,
    like saying the outboard motor of a boat could come together, because, you could
    use the propeller to cut grass, and the carburetor tin to work as an ash tray,
    the pistons as medicine dispensers. Could happen, but the odds seem really low.
    Every protein will be similar to some protein (ie, 'homologous'), but the probability
    that natural selection favored species with individual C-A-T-G errors that slowly
    took 50 different complex proteins, adjusted them appropriately (remember, each
    protein contains usually hundreds of amino acids), moved them next to each other,
    and also kept the supply chain within the cell in lock step with these changes
    (every part needs a supply and removal chain), seems more improbable than the
    thought that we are created by really smart aliens in the 10-th dimension.

    by a bunch of monkeys, but they have estimated that even this would take 1E183800
    keystrokes to write Hamlet. The universe has only 1E79 (ie, 10^79) hydrogen atoms,
    and only existed for 4E17 seconds. There’s a big difference between infinity and
    these numbers, especially related to 1E183800\. For the human genetic code, it
    seems like similar odds to writing Shakespeare given the complexity of our various
    cellular, immunological, and endocrine processes. But the counter argument is
    that because I’m conscious, and there are many universes, and perhaps the big
    bang happens again and again, etc., I am really looking at a conditional probability,
    and I've basically won the most improbable PowerBall in the multiverse (good to
    remember on bad days). My speculation is that it’s a set of creators, of unknown
    form, using templates (probably like in Dreamweaver, under C:\users\The Creator\templates\organic\eukaryotes
    folder), and drinking the 10-th dimensional version of coffee, while cranking
    out the next beetle (asked what could be inferred about the work of the Creator
    from a study of His works, the British scientist J.B.S. Haldane replied, that
    He has "an inordinate fondness for beetles", given there are so many different
    kinds (conservatively about 350,000). These are probably training exercises for
    those new to the team).
