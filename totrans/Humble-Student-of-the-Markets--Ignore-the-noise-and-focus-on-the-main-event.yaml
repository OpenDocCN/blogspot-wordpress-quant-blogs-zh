    stock market just before a key event with a binary outcome, such as an FOMC decision,

- en: As we await the outcome of the debt ceiling negotiations in Washington, the
    market is left to guessing the direction of stock prices. Analysts wind up focusing
    on indicators that have little or no value, such as the size of (former) Fed Chair
    Alan Greenspan's briefcase. While negotiations are at an apparent impasse, we
    are left to guessing how much of the statements from each side is real and how
    much is bluff., or even the exact timing of X-date, or the day the U.S. Treasury
    runs out of money It's highly likely a deal will be reached and the U.S. will
    not default on its debts, at this point it's all noise as the S&P 500 remains
    in a trading band.

    can yield some clues as to the degree of market reaction once the results of the
    binary event is known.
