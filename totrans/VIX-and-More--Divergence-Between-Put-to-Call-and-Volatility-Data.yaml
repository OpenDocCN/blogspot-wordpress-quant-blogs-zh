    I talked about how bullish moves can be fueled by a large supply of non-believers
    who prefer to cling to a wall of worry in times of great uncertainty.  These investors
    often prefer to wait until a bullish move is well established before they cautiously
    and reluctantly begin to resume long positions.

    how worried these investors are, but [put to call ratios](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/put%20to%20call)
    do us one better: they give us a sense of their numbers.  Right now, the numbers
    are compelling.  As I noted in my [weekly VIX recap](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/02/vwsi-at-1-as-put-to-call-numbers-raise.html),
    the [ISEE](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/ISEE) data reflect all-time
    record lows of new call positions initiated relative to new put positions on the
    International Securities Exchange (ISE) over the past 20 days – a trend that has
    carried over to today’s session.'

    put to call ratio](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/put%20to%20call)
    ($CPCE on StockCharts.com), a chart of which I have included below.  Like the
    ISEE, the CPCE is showing historically high level of puts to calls – in numbers
    not seen since early 2005.  In the chart below, note that P/C readings of 0.70
    or higher have consistently been good buying opportunities and today’s 10 day
    EMA of 0.73 has not been surpassed since May 2005.

- en: Several readers have asked about the significance of a divergence between volatility
    and put to call readings.  As I discussed last May in [More Thoughts on the PCVXO](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/05/more-thoughts-on-pcvxo.html),
    divergences in which volatility readings are much higher than put to call numbers
    are usually bullish, while the current situation, with put to call numbers much
    higher than volatility data, tend to resolve in a bearish move going forward.
