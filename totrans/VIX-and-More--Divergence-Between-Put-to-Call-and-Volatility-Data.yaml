- en: Several weeks ago in [Checking for Atheists](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/01/checking-for-atheists.html),
    I talked about how bullish moves can be fueled by a large supply of non-believers
    who prefer to cling to a wall of worry in times of great uncertainty.  These investors
    often prefer to wait until a bullish move is well established before they cautiously
    and reluctantly begin to resume long positions.

  zh: 几周前在[查找无神论者](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/01/checking-for-atheists.html)中，我谈到了看涨走势可以由大量非信徒推动，他们在巨大不确定性面前更愿意紧贴着忧虑之墙。这些投资者通常喜欢等到看涨走势确立之后，他们才会谨慎并不情愿地开始恢复多头头寸。
- en: 'Volatility indicators, such as the VIX, usually provide an insight into just
    how worried these investors are, but [put to call ratios](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/put%20to%20call)
    do us one better: they give us a sense of their numbers.  Right now, the numbers
    are compelling.  As I noted in my [weekly VIX recap](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/02/vwsi-at-1-as-put-to-call-numbers-raise.html),
    the [ISEE](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/ISEE) data reflect all-time
    record lows of new call positions initiated relative to new put positions on the
    International Securities Exchange (ISE) over the past 20 days – a trend that has
    carried over to today’s session.'

  zh: 波动性指标，如VIX，通常能提供投资者担忧程度的洞察，但[看跌/看涨比率](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/put%20to%20call)更进一步：它们让我们了解到他们的数量。目前，这些数字很有说服力。正如我在[每周VIX回顾](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/02/vwsi-at-1-as-put-to-call-numbers-raise.html)中提到的，[ISEE](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/ISEE)数据显示，过去20天里，相对于国际证券交易所(ISE)上的新看跌期权，新看涨期权的启动数量创下了历史新低——这一趋势延续到了今天的交易中。
- en: The other important put to call ratio that I follow closely is the [CBOE’s equity
    put to call ratio](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/put%20to%20call)
    ($CPCE on StockCharts.com), a chart of which I have included below.  Like the
    ISEE, the CPCE is showing historically high level of puts to calls – in numbers
    not seen since early 2005.  In the chart below, note that P/C readings of 0.70
    or higher have consistently been good buying opportunities and today’s 10 day
    EMA of 0.73 has not been surpassed since May 2005.

  zh: 我密切关注的另一个重要的看跌/看涨比率是[CBOE的股票看跌/看涨比率](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/put%20to%20call)（在StockCharts.com上为$CPCE），下面附有它的图表。与ISEE一样，CPCE显示了历史上高的看跌/看涨水平——这是自2005年初以来未曾见过的。在下面的图表中，请注意，P/C读数0.70或更高一直是有利的买入机会，而今天的10日EMA为0.73，自2005年5月以来还没有被超越过。
- en: Several readers have asked about the significance of a divergence between volatility
    and put to call readings.  As I discussed last May in [More Thoughts on the PCVXO](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/05/more-thoughts-on-pcvxo.html),
    divergences in which volatility readings are much higher than put to call numbers
    are usually bullish, while the current situation, with put to call numbers much
    higher than volatility data, tend to resolve in a bearish move going forward.

  zh: 一些读者询问了波动率与看跌/看涨读数之间分歧的重要性。正如我去年5月在[关于PCVXO的更多思考](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/05/more-thoughts-on-pcvxo.html)中讨论的，波动率读数远高于看跌/看涨数字的背离通常是看涨的，而当前的情况，看跌/看涨数字远高于波动率数据，预示着未来可能会有看跌的走势。
