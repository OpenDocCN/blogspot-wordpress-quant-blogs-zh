    as I have an appointment just after the market close and the prices shown in the
    charts will not reflect today''s closing prices.  As the S&P 500 struggles with
    overhead resistance, I would like to offer some words of warning for equity bulls.
    The VIX Index has returned to levels not seen since November 2021, before the
    market topped out. Is that a sign of complacency, or normalization?'

    and the retirement of the transitory language by the Federal Reserve. While this
    doesn't mean that the market will necessarily fall immediately, it does indicate
    a possible precarious backdrop and an accident waiting to happen.
