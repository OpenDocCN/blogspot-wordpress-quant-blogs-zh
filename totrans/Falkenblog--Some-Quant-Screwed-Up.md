# Falkenblog: Some Quant Screwed Up

> 来源：[http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2012/07/some-quant-screwed-up.html#0001-01-01](http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2012/07/some-quant-screwed-up.html#0001-01-01)

Last Thursday, a very non-typical hourly saw-tooth pattern emerged in several stocks. By the time we saw this mid-day, we were intrigued, with some message boards noting it. I don't know the provenance of this pattern, but suspect it was a poorly designed algorithm that was trying to buy some fixed amount at the hour until completion, and did this repetitively over the day in some newfangled VWAP attempt. It looks like it shot out stupid buy orders for the first 30 minutes of each hour.

Clearly someone screwed up, because after the second time this happens you should stop your stupid program and tweak it.

Here's IBM, Coca-Cola, and McDonald's price movements over that day. This isn't random.
