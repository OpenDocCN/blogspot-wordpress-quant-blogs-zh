- en: that I previously mentioned reports that "My problem with the matlab2ib product
    was that it did not have a function for all the Active X methods. ( for example
    the Market Scanners, Real time Bars and Fundamental Data methods are missing).
    I also had issues when I tried to steam in trades data(I'm not sure if the matlab2ib
    product allows you to even do this?)." Apparently Max's API has included these
    methods, though I have not personally tried them.
