    spike in volatility, I [recommend going long](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/03/long-volatility-with-exchanges.html)
    the [Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=cme),
    now know as CME Group following the completion of their merger with the CBOT,
    as a back door [hedge](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/hedging) against
    increased volatility.'

    recommendation](http://www.thestreet.com/_yahoo/newsanalysis/stockpickr/10370894.html?cm_ven=YAHOO&cm_cat=FREE&cm_ite=NA),
    Business Week has described "[a sea change in the way trading is done](http://www.businessweek.com/investor/content/jul2007/pi20070728_984403.htm?campaign_id=yhoo),"
    and an AP story confirmed an ever growing bandwagon [last Friday](http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/070727/cme_group_mover.html?.v=1),
    when CME closed with an impressive 19.00 gain.

    play, with the [most recent quarterly results](http://biz.yahoo.com/rb/070724/cme_results.html?.v=1)
    supporting that idea. If, however, the VIX continues with a 20 handle past Labor
    Day, then I suspect CME could be a much bigger winner than many on the current
    bandwagon expect.

    one month out can be a [humbling experience](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/07/volatility-aces-bloggers.html)...
