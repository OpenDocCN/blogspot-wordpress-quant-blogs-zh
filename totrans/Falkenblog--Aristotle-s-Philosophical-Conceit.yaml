    gospel, that the thoughtful sages could be rich if they really wanted to.

    a great harvest of olives in the coming year; so, having a little money, he gave
    deposits for the use of all the olive-presses in Chios and Miletus, which he hired
    at a low price because no one bid against him. When the harvest-time came, and
    many were wanted all at once and of a sudden, he let them out at any rate which
    he pleased, and made a quantity of money.

    entrails and the like was popular back then and they had lots of other wacky beliefs,
    but the idea that they traded on them and prospered is clearly a self-serving
    lie. Today, we have active mutual fund managers who claim to outperform indices
    even though this has never been the case, so I guess every age has its own myths.
