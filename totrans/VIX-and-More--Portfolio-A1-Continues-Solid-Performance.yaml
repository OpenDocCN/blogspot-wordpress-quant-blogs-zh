- en: Four of Portfolio A1’s five holdings – all but [WCG](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=wcg),
    which was purchased on Monday – can now claim double digit returns.  As WCG (WellCare
    Health Plans) has been a top performer in the red hot health care sector, the
    current composition of this portfolio looks as strong as it has been since the
    launch eight weeks ago.  During those 8 weeks, Portfolio has gained 4.4%, while
    the benchmark S&P 500 has declined 0.2%.
