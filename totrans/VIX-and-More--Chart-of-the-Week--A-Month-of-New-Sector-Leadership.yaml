    buying conviction and strong leadership.

    below, I have tracked the performance of the nine AMEX [sector](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/sectors)
    [SPDR](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SPDRs)s over the course of
    the past month. Note that former leaders financials ([XLF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLF))
    and energy ([XLE](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLE)) are now lagging,
    while defensive sectors such as utilities ([XLU](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLU))
    and health care ([XLV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLV)) are leading
    the way. Now I have nothing against utilities and health care, but the next time
    these two sectors lead a significant bull rally will be the first time in my memory.
    One or more of technology ([XLK](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLK)),
    consumer discretionary ([XLY](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLY)),
    materials ([XLB](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLB)) or perhaps
    financials needs to take a leadership role to give the next bullish leg the type
    of strength that portfolio managers can believe in.

    buyers.
