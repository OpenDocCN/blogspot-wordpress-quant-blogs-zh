Early data from the Christmas shopping season suggests that the consumer is more willing to spend than most pundits had anticipated.

In the deluge of December data to come, there will be answers to questions about how much consumers are spending, where they are buying, how important discounts are to their buying decisions, how much credit they are using, etc.

From a stock picking perspective, however, I am most interested in how upscale the purchases will be. Is this going to be a

appropriate for those who own property on at least three continents. For the normal consumer, the

[S&P Retail Index](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=%5ERLX)

shops. Combine the two and get one of those StockCharts.com ratio charts like the one below, which shows that for the past three months at least, luxury goods have held up nicely while the stocks of mainstream retailers have struggled in comparison.
