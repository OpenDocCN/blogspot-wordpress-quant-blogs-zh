- en: I discussed Fed Days that close at new highs.  The basic finding was that when
    the market closed at a short-term high on a Fed Day, then it was likely to pull
    back over the next few days.  But when it closed at a long-term high, then the
    rally was likely to continue.  Below is a study from the guide that.  I’ve updated
    all the stats.
