- en: Bubble or not, the [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures)
    are stretched to an extreme that I do not ever recall seeing and to the extent
    that the grapevine is whispering to Adam Warner of the [Daily Options Report](http://www.dailyoptionsreport.com/)
    that the differential between the first month and third month VIX futures is at
    its highest level ever. (Note to self, why doesn’t the grapevine ever whisper
    to me?)

- en: The chart below, courtesy of [FutureSource.com](http://futuresource.quote.com/),
    shows the difference between the VIX third month futures and front month futures
    (VX V0 – VX N0 in current VIX futures parlance) going back about six months. Personally,
    I tend to get excited when the third month VIX futures rises more than 2.00 higher
    than the front month, as this frequently suggests that the [VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX)
    negative [roll yield](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/roll%20yield)
    contango play is starting to set up.

    than any other subject. As much confusion as there is about VXX, I think it is
    probably time to come out with an extended look at this volatility product in
    the next week or two.
