    surely considered this sale to be sensitive information, but I believe that their
    execution method was quite conspicuous.

    days of persistently high volume, it seemed very likely that Pershing Square was

    “I hope Pershing Sq read my post,” along with some screenshots of Valeant volume

    when IEX showed a lot of activity on Valeant, the price seemed to either drift
    down or stay stable (sometimes appearing “pinned”) — and, when IEX showed a pause

    the IEX-favoring trader was selling. [[4](#bottom4pershing)] [Short-swing profit](http://cblr.columbia.edu/archives/12334)

    market centers. Sometimes these relationships can result in suboptimal execution
    quality. But hopefully, in exchange for their loyalty, traders receive other benefits.
    Perhaps Pershing Square has decided that furthering IEX’s “pro-investor” agenda
    is worth leaking their trading intentions. Or, more cynically, perhaps they’ve
    decided that it’s more important to support their investment in IEX. Either way,
    if I were Pershing Square, I’d be giving those decisions another look. [[6](#bottom6pershing)]

    for a machine to read the data from the website though (a tool like [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/)
    might work). That data could probably be matched with off-exchange prints on the

    I have never used information like this to make trading decisions (nor has my
    company), but I believe it’d be perfectly compliant to do so. Valeant volume (single-counted)
    on IEX was comparable to the volume Pershing Square [reported](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/885590/000119312515418565/d106380dex997.htm)
    for each day. So, if Pershing sent 1/3 of their volume to IEX (see [[1](#bottom1pershing)]),
    that means that their order flow probably attracted liquidity onto IEX. A lot
    of that may have been due to execution algos noticing the flow and choosing to
    interact with it. If execution algos can use information from dark pool fills
    to make trading decisions, then surely prop traders can too. This is probably
    a much more important source of information leakage than the type that IEX claims

    routing decision. At 18mils/share, IEX would’ve made $9k extra revenue. Maybe
    there’s some momentum effect where, as IEX receives more volume, they attract
    future business. Let’s be generous then and say this volume is worth $100k to
    IEX and its project, and that Pershing Square believes any benefit to this project
    fully accrues to institutional traders like themselves.

    market cap as Nasdaq, $10B. 5 million shares is about 0.2% of IEX’s [monthly](http://www.iextrading.com/stats/)
    volume of 2-3B shares. Say that Pershing Square typically trades about once per
    month, so that they can increase IEX’s long-term revenue by 0.2%. Again, let’s
    be generous and say that 0.2% of revenue increases IEX’s chance of “success” by
    1%. So, Pershing Square’s loyalty could improve IEX’s expected value by as much
    as $10M. It’s hard for me to parse IEX’s [cap table](https://www.sec.gov/rules/other/2015/investors-exchange-form-1-exhibits-g-n.pdf#page=29)
    in their exchange application, but let’s guess that Pershing Square owns 5% of
    it. That’d mean that Pershing Square would receive an expected-value benefit of
    $500k from their routing favoritism.

    they finished their trading. By what amount would Valeant’s stock move? I don’t
    know, but a conservative estimate should be at least 1%, right? Given the explosion
    in volume on IEX, what probability would the market assign to the possibility
    that Pershing was selling? My personal estimate at the time was over 50%, with
    a <10% chance that they were buying (neither I nor my company used this information
    to trade). So, perhaps the stock would (and did) drop by 0.5% because of this
    leak. If Pershing had $300M left to trade, this one incident would cost them $1.5M.
    And it’s not hard to imagine this number being several times higher.

    expects them to. Now, people looking at IEX’s reported volume wouldn’t have much
    idea of the side of the trade, or that it came from Pershing Square. But, the
    market-makers on IEX would probably know the side. The first hour after Pershing’s
    meta-order begins trading, maybe these HFTs develop an inkling (10% probability)
    that the meta-order is large (50% of ADV). Let’s assume, as IEX seems to, that
    HFTs are ruthless and that they start moving the price in accordance with the
    meta-order’s expected market impact. Using the square-root law (e.g. [p8](https://workspace.imperial.ac.uk/quantitativefinance/Public/events/SLIDES%203RD%20IMPERIAL%20ETH/Jonathan%20Donier%20.pdf)),
    the 50% of ADV meta-order could be expected to move the price by sqrt(0.5) * the
    stock’s daily volatility. Say the daily volatility is 1%, so the market impact
    would be around 0.7%. It’s already been an hour though, so perhaps half of this
    market impact has already occurred. The HFTs have 10% confidence that this further
    0.35% move will happen, so they move the price by 0.03%. If Pershing had $300M
    left to trade at this point, that 0.03% would cost them about $100k. And maybe
    Pershing trades this size 5 times per year, so the routing preference could cost
    them $500k/yr. This is a paranoid (and rough) estimate of HFT order anticipation,
    but paranoia seems to be part of the IEX ethos.
