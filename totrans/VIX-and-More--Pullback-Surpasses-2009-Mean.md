# VIX and More: Pullback Surpasses 2009 Mean

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/10/pullback-surpasses-2009-mean.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/10/pullback-surpasses-2009-mean.html#0001-01-01)

While this might not provide a great deal of comfort to longs, I have updated the VIX and More Pullback Table to reflect today’s selloff. The table shows that the peak to trough drop of 67.98 points (6.2%) in the SPX has exceeded the 2009 average of 5.8%.

As noted previously, a 5.8% pullback from the SPX 1101 established a target low of 1037\. Today the SPX has been as low as 1033.38.

Looking at the charts, I would expect to see additional support in the 1015-1020 level should the 1034 mark fail to hold. In the meantime, brave souls who heed the [VIX spike history](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/10/vix-spike-of-35-in-four-days-is-short.html) or the [strangle pong](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/10/strangle-pong.html) strategy should have a long bias going forward.
