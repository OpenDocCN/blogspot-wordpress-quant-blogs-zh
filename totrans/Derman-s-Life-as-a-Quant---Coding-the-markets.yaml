- en: Nearing the end of Derman’s book, and I can recommend it wholeheartedly to any
    developer working in the rates business. It’s written in an easy style with a
    well balanced mix of personal and family narrative, accessible technical content
    and anecdote. Derman covers his physics career – we encounter Richard Feynmann
    and Douglas Hofstadter (Godel, Escher, Bach) while enjoying a survey of particle
    physics in the 60s and 70s. Then Derman moves on to Bell Labs where he learns
    to code and works with Kernighan, Ritchie, Plauger and Stroustrup. Then on to
    Wall St, Goldmans, Salomon Bros, Fischer Black, John Meriwether, Gutfreund and
    many of the usual suspects familiar from Liars Poker, FIASCO etc. It’s all leavened
    with insight on theoretical and experimental work in physics, coding and financial
    modelling.
