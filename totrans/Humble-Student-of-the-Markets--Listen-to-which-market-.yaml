    equities broke out to the upside on Friday, many traders sat up and took notice.
    True, stocks also had a failed downside thrust when it violated resistance recently,
    but the current move certainly shows that the bulls have the upper hand.

    that this weekend's meeting was not going to produce a definitive agreement and
    that a second meeting on Wednesday October 26 should have been terrible news and
    the markets should have cratered. While they did decline between 1% and 1.5% on

    to set aside recession concerns, is a mistake born of confusion between leading
    indicators and lagging ones. Leading evidence is not only clear, but on a statistical
    basis is essentially certain that the U.S. economy, and indeed, the global economy,
    faces an oncoming recession. As Lakshman Achuthan notes on the basis of ECRI''s
    own (and historically reliable) set of indicators, "We''ve entered a vicious cycle,
    and it''s too late: a recession can''t be averted." Likewise, lagging evidence
    is largely clear that the economy was not yet in a recession as of, say, August
    or September. The error that investors are inviting here is to treat lagging indicators
    as if they are leading ones.'

    tend to operate with a lead of a few months. Those few months are often critical,
    in the sense that the markets can often suffer deep and abrupt losses before coincident
    and lagging evidence demonstrates actual economic weakness. As a result, there
    is sometimes a "denial" phase between the point where the leading evidence locks
    onto a recession track, and the point where the coincident evidence confirms it.
    We saw exactly that sort of pattern prior to the last recession. While the recession
    evidence was in by November 2007 (see [Expecting A Recession](http://www.hussmanfunds.com/wmc/wmc071112.htm)
    ), the economy enjoyed two additional months of payroll job growth, and new claims
    for unemployment trended higher in a choppy and indecisive way until well into
    2008\. Even after Bear Stearns failed in March 2008, the market briefly staged
    a rally that put it within about 10% of its bull market high.

    that many German bureaucrats understand that the ultimate solution is to allow
    the ECB to go nuclear and print money like Helicopter Ben and having Mario Draghi
    at the head of the ECB gives them political cover to blame the Italian. The objections
    of the Old Guard, who will still remember the hyperinflation era of the Weimar
    Republic and will brook no discussion about any form of reflationary policy, will
    eventually be overcome. What you see in the news is just posturing by various
    parties playing to their own constituencies but the True Grand Plan will be revealed
    in the near future.
