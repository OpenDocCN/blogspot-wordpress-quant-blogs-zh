    like he is headed for a heart attack ("Lehman moment"). The protocol is well defined
    in these circumstances. Take steps to stabilize him ("inject liquidity via the
    ECB") and then address the causes with a program of diet, exercise and medical
    treatment ("longer term solutions such as balanced budgets, pro-growth policies,
    possibly closer fiscal integration, two-speed eurozone, etc."). Berating him about
    being lazy and overeating ("you lazy Greeks, Italians...") and making him get
    on the treadmill to work off his Thanksgiving feast ("more austerity and IMF monitors")
    while he is on the verge of a heart attack ("Lehman like financial crisis") is
    less than helpful under the circumstances.

    we now have to rely purely on fiscal policy. Will a new Brussels-on-the-Rhine,
    even if it were to be ratified by the eurozone governments, be able to do such
    heavy lifting without plunging Europe and the rest of the world into a deep recession?
