    over quantitative investment systems. In particular, I have been concerned about
    the takeover of trading the HFT robots.

    is only one time the so-called nuclear briefcases were broken out and opened up.
    On January 25, 1995 they not only opened, they nearly launched Russia's nuclear
    arsenal at the United States.

    the earth near Russia, but he'd contacted the proper Kremlin authorities and hadn't

    was launched, is that the Brant's radar signature looks just like a U.S. sub-launched
    Trident missile.

    stable systems had been demolished and replacements had yet to fall into place.
    One thing that had gotten only more developed since 1991, however, was the Kremlin's
    mistrust of the United States.

    to decide if this was an electro-magnetic pulse attack that would disable their
    radar and allow for a full on American attack, and what they should do about it.

    and fired up another. The radar signature now looked so much like a multiple re-entry
    vehicle (MRV), a missile carrying multiple nuclear warheads, that military officers
    no longer had any doubt.
