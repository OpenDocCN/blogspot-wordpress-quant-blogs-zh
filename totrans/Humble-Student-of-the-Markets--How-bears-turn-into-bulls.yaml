    This week, the S&P 500 weakened and failed to confirm the reversal candle, though
    the market is still exhibiting a positive 5-week RSI divergence and it is still
    testing support at the 200 week moving average.

    the old market leaders fade and new leadership emerges to lead the new bull cycle.
    The change in leadership is a constructive market internal that is indicative
    of a bottoming process.
