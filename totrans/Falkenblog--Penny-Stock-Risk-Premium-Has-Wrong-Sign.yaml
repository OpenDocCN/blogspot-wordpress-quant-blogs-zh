    include penny stocks, so it's a good 'out of sample' test of my hypothesis, that
    he risk premium rises as one goes from super safe to safe, stays flat, then goes
    the wrong way for lottery ticket investments like sports betting, distressed debt,
    high volatility stocks, and of course lottery tickets.

    This represents less than a month of typical NYSE volume. Still, the OTC markets

    from the first observation to the last. In total, stocks in the OTC market lost
    approximately $180 Billion of market value over our sample period. These numbers
    themselves are conservative because we did not make any assumption about the value
    depreciation taking place for stocks that no longer trade.'

    a framework, so that any anomaly merely rejects an incorrect theory within this
    framework, and not the framework itself. Nonetheless, it is supposedly the foundation

    not risk averse, but rather risk-loving over various parts of the return distribution
    for specific asset classes. Kahneman and Tversky''s famous prospect theory argued
    that things like lotteries could be explained by ''risk-seeking behavior in losses
    involving moderate probabilities and of small probability gains'', which of course
    is different. The Black Swan idea is that people prefer high probability bets
    with small gains but occasion high losses. The point is clear: the utility function
    explains residual returns, and places no restrictions on them.'

    same thing. It explains why risk premiums don't exist in general. It also explains
    the Easterlin Paradox, where greater wealth over time has neither reduced the
    risk free rate, nor increased general happiness. It explains too why people's
    asset allocations generally ignore strict mean-variance optimization, because
    they consider what the 'standard allocation' to be risk neutral, because keeping-up-with-the-Joneses
    is risk neutral. It's rather straightforward to increase one's Sharpe ratio (buy
