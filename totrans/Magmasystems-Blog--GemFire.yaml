    of GemFire is a big plus. They also have .NET bindings, and I will be checking
    those out too.

- en: One gotcha .... GemFire does not work on Windows 2000 because of the underlying
    dependencies on 29West's LBM message broker. This is a real nasty if you want
    to do an evaluation on your desktop at work, but your company is still in Windows
    2000-land. So, I had to load up GemFire on my home laptop, which runs XP Pro,
    and will do the evaluation on my laptop.

    some of our calc engines. Object Caches like GigaSpaces are used already in a
    lot of Wall Street IBs just for that purpose. I have heard a little rumbling about
    GigaSpace implementations from some former colleagues, so we are hoping that GemFire
    will be worry-free. Already, I am impressed with their support staff (thanks to
    Mike and Santiago for timely responses).

    or used object caches in your financial apps, especially C++ or C# apps. Feel
    free to comment here or email me privately.
