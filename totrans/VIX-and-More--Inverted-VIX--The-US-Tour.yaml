    on two previous occasions, most recently about 5 ½ months ago in [Inverted VIX
    Still Bullish](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/12/inverted-vix-still-bullish.html).

    in a weekly chart and looking at longer term patterns.  A lot has changed on the
    volatility front in 5 ½ months, as evidenced by the fact that the current inverted
    VIX is farther above its 50 week moving average than it has been at any time since
    the record 64% one day spike in the VIX on February 27, 2007.'

- en: Perhaps even more interesting is that in this five year lookback period covered
    by the chart, current VIX levels look positively middling and unremarkable on
    an absolute basis, even though the VIX has come a long way in a short time on
    a relative basis.  A new VIX floor in the 15-16 range is not unreasonable.  It
    is higher than the new [VIX floor of 13-15](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/08/big-question-for-vix-is-not-how-high.html)
    I was calling for on August 1, 2007, but given all that has transpired in the
    markets over the past ten months, the fact that these numbers are even in the
    same ballpark is something to ponder.
