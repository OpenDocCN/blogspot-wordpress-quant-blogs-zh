- en: When the Tech Bubble burst in 2000 and equities went down in the ensuing bear
    market, hedge fund returns were uncorrelated to equity returns. Thus, they appeared
    attractive as an alternative investment because of their alpha and their low correlation
    to equities and other asset classes. Given this recent persistent high level of
    equity correlation, investors will no doubt begin to question the role of hedge
    funds in a diversified portfolio.

- en: The accompanying chart shows the returns of the HFRX Equity Market Neutral Index
    (-3.0% YTD) versus the S&P 500 (-9.8% YTD). Returns started becoming more correlated
    in late 2005 and early 2006 and have more or less continued to this day. For a
    group of funds that is supposed to be non-directional to the market their returns
    are exhibiting a very high market beta.
