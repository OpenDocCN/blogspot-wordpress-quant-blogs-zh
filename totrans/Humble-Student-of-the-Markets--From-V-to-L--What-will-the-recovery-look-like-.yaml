    spiked to 6.6 million, and the March headline Non-Farm Payroll printed at a dismal
    -701K. The unemployment rate would have been even worse had the participation
    rate not fallen and depressed the size of the labor force. My desk has been flooded
    with bear porn.

    (After the Disease). What will the recovery look like? There is a wide continuum
    of recovery shapes from V to L.
