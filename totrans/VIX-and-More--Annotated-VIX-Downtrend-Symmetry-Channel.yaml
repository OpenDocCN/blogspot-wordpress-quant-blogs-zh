    the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week)
    contest. After several reader requests, I am taking the liberty of posting some
    of my favorites that fell just short of the (highly subjective) gold medal, but
    probably should have been somewhere on the podium.

    In my opinion, Rick’s chart is a superb example of using the power of clean lines
    and annotations to turn a great deal of data into a relatively simple interpretive
    model with buy and sell signals that are easy to discern. Not only is the look
    and feel attractive, but the interpretation and conclusions are interesting as
    well. This chart has quite a few moving parts, but they are integrated well, with
    an overlay of geometry and commentary that makes the main chart and three supplementary
    studies easy to digest and act upon.
