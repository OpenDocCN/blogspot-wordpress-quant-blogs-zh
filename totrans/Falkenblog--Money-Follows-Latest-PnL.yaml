- en: Money is now pouring into commodity funds, and any other strategy that has worked
    for the past 18 months. Do these strategies have higher expected returns, or lower
    risk than 18 months ago? I don't think so, but I do think it plays off a common
    investing tendency to use the recent past as large indicator of future returns.
    This reminds me of a Gallup poll put out by Paine Weber in 1998, at the beginning
    of the stock market boom. They surveyed an expected return of 13% from investors.
    After back to back 20%+ returns in the S&P500, and the Nasdaq more than doubled,
    investors raised their expectations to 18% in February of 2000, right before the
    peak. Two years later, after a 50% correction, they anticipated only a 7% expected
    return.

    fine, but not so much in the past year. Could I tweak my model to work that year
    too? 1999 saw the Nasdaq double, so anything less, especially negative, seemed
    positively lousy. Another instance in the 90's I was talking to someone in the
    equity index group at my bank, and said that, since low vol stocks outperform
    high vol stocks, you could generate a couple percent premium by investing in low
    volatility stocks and have low aggregate 'risk' as measured by vol or beta. He
    said, 'couple of percent? I can get 10%!'

    the past 5 years and whatever strategy you have will have done well. Smart guy
    that he is, I'm sure he'll rationalize his model very well, but it's all pointless
    because there's an appetite to invest in what has worked recently. The only trick
    is some logic to convince yourself, or you backers, that this isn't so dumb as
    merely going long those commodities that went up over the past 5 years.

    highly nonlinear and dependent only on the past year's returns (Sirri and Tufano,
    1998 JoF; Chevalier and Ellison, 1995), and convex payouts are more valuable the
    more risk you take (e.g., higher vol increases the option price). Risk metrics
    or benchmark returns don't matter AT ALL in mutual fund inflows, it's just past
    year's absolute return, because for someone who knew, there was no risk, and the
    strategist will swear there was no risk, he just knew. This is probably relevant
    to momentum, in that initially something works for real reasons, it's eventually
    accentuated by those putting capital into what has gone up, which causes positive
    autocorrelation.

    the 'best' calls, meaning, analysts were highlighted for choosing the biggest
    winners. It didn't give average stats for the individuals, though it did show
    'averages' by firm, which ranged around 50% for 'correct' picks. Also, it didn't
    count a pick correct if it was called too early, so if you were bearish on Bear
    Stearns in 2006, the fact that it failed in March 2008 doesn't count, even though
    the fundamental (weak housing market, too much housing exposure) was baked in
    then. Some statistics only targeted the 'highest volatility stocks', meaning,
    if you analyzed a low vol stock, you couldn't be right. The market seems to evaluate
    investors using a metric that clearly gives an incentive for merely taking big
    gambles on highly speculative plays, updating them frequently, and if one comes
    in, you ignore everything else and ride it. Given the nonlinear inflows or media
    attention to a 'big winner', professionals are very much like stupid retail traders,

- en: I was talking to someone running a hedge fund recently, and he said they were
    looking for strategies that produced 'out-of-sample' Sharpe ratios of 2+, preferably
    4\. It was like a mutual fund manager saying he wanted people who outperformed
    the benchmarks by 10%, preferably 20%. It was a big fund. Most (all?) people who
    would surpass this filter are ignorant or deceitful, because such objectively
    good strategies are about as rare going forward as they have been in the past
    (the average fund, which is a composite of strategies, generally has a Sharpe
    below 1.0).

    have huge potential returns or 2) work all the time. I think positive thinking
    is healthy, but at this level it's a little bit like candidate criteria that no
    one passes, so the choice is made for some highly unquantifiable reason because
    the alternative is to choose no one.

    a long horizon that avoids high fliers. You won't win any single tourney, and
    you may never get a chance to ply the strategy, because people with capital want
    someone to gamble their money on something that can win huge though rationalize
    it well. This preference isn't going away, so I say, invest in conspicuously boring
    assets (though, not as boring as 'cash').
