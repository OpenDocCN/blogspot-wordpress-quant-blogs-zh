- en: Money is now pouring into commodity funds, and any other strategy that has worked
    for the past 18 months. Do these strategies have higher expected returns, or lower
    risk than 18 months ago? I don't think so, but I do think it plays off a common
    investing tendency to use the recent past as large indicator of future returns.
    This reminds me of a Gallup poll put out by Paine Weber in 1998, at the beginning
    of the stock market boom. They surveyed an expected return of 13% from investors.
    After back to back 20%+ returns in the S&P500, and the Nasdaq more than doubled,
    investors raised their expectations to 18% in February of 2000, right before the
    peak. Two years later, after a 50% correction, they anticipated only a 7% expected
    return.

  zh: 现在资金正在涌入商品基金，以及其他在过去 18 个月有效的策略。这些策略是否有比 18 个月前更高的预期收益，或者低风险呢？我不这么认为，但我认为它反映了一个普遍的投资倾向，即将最近的过去作为未来收益的重要指标。这让我想起了
    1998 年由派恩韦伯进行的一项盖洛普民调，在股市繁荣开始时进行的。他们对投资者的预期收益进行了调查，预期收益率为 13%。在 S&P500 连续两年实现超过
    20% 的回报后，纳斯达克指数翻倍增长后，投资者在 2000 年 2 月将他们的期望值提高到了 18%，就在峰值之前。两年后，在经历了 50% 的回撤之后，他们期望的预期收益只有
    7%。

- en: I remember pitching a strategy to a hedge fund guy in 1999 and he said, it worked
    fine, but not so much in the past year. Could I tweak my model to work that year
    too? 1999 saw the Nasdaq double, so anything less, especially negative, seemed
    positively lousy. Another instance in the 90's I was talking to someone in the
    equity index group at my bank, and said that, since low vol stocks outperform
    high vol stocks, you could generate a couple percent premium by investing in low
    volatility stocks and have low aggregate 'risk' as measured by vol or beta. He
    said, 'couple of percent? I can get 10%!'

    年代的另一个例子是，我在银行股权指数组谈到，由于低波动股票的表现优于高波动股票，你可以通过投资于低波动股票获得几个百分点的溢价，并且低总体‘风险’（按波动率或β计算）。他说，‘几个百分点？我能拿到
    10%！’

- en: If you look at mutual fund inflows, you see a distinct inflow pattern that's
    highly nonlinear and dependent only on the past year's returns (Sirri and Tufano,
    1998 JoF; Chevalier and Ellison, 1995), and convex payouts are more valuable the
    more risk you take (e.g., higher vol increases the option price). Risk metrics
    or benchmark returns don't matter AT ALL in mutual fund inflows, it's just past
    year's absolute return, because for someone who knew, there was no risk, and the
    strategist will swear there was no risk, he just knew. This is probably relevant
    to momentum, in that initially something works for real reasons, it's eventually
    accentuated by those putting capital into what has gone up, which causes positive
    autocorrelation.

    and Ellison，1995），并且凸形的回报在你承担的风险越大时价值越大（例如，更高的波动率增加了期权价格）。风险衡量或基准回报对共同基金流入根本没有影响，只取决于过去一年的绝对回报，因为对于了解的人而言，没有风险，策略家会发誓没有风险，他只是知道。这对势头可能很重要，因为最初某些事情出于真正的原因而成功，最终由于那些将资本投入上升的事物而被夸大，这导致了积极的自相关性。

    the 'best' calls, meaning, analysts were highlighted for choosing the biggest
    winners. It didn't give average stats for the individuals, though it did show
    'averages' by firm, which ranged around 50% for 'correct' picks. Also, it didn't
    count a pick correct if it was called too early, so if you were bearish on Bear
    Stearns in 2006, the fact that it failed in March 2008 doesn't count, even though
    the fundamental (weak housing market, too much housing exposure) was baked in
    then. Some statistics only targeted the 'highest volatility stocks', meaning,
    if you analyzed a low vol stock, you couldn't be right. The market seems to evaluate
    investors using a metric that clearly gives an incentive for merely taking big
    gambles on highly speculative plays, updating them frequently, and if one comes
    in, you ignore everything else and ride it. Given the nonlinear inflows or media

    '最高波动率的股票'，意思是，如果你分析低波动率的股票，你就不会是正确的。市场似乎使用一个明显改变投资者行为的指标，这个指标明显鼓励人们只是在高度投机性的交易上赌很大的赌注，并经常更新他们，如果一个交易成功了，你就会忽略其他一切并继续走下去。鉴于非线性的流入或对

    the benchmarks by 10%, preferably 20%. It was a big fund. Most (all?) people who
    would surpass this filter are ignorant or deceitful, because such objectively
    good strategies are about as rare going forward as they have been in the past

    a long horizon that avoids high fliers. You won't win any single tourney, and

    someone to gamble their money on something that can win huge though rationalize
