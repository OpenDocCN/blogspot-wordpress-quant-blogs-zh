# VIX and More: The Art of Being Wrong

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/06/art-of-being-wrong.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/06/art-of-being-wrong.html#0001-01-01)

[Kathryn Schulz](http://www.beingwrongbook.com/author), a self-described ‘wrongologist,’ is the author of [Being Wrong: Adventures in the Margin of Error](http://www.amazon.com/Being-Wrong-Adventures-Margin-Error/dp/0061176044/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpt_1).

I can’t say that I have read her book, but I think her interview with [Victor Niederhoffer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Niederhoffer) at Slate, [Hoodoos, Hedge Funds, and Alibis: Victor Niederhoffer on Being Wrong](http://www.slate.com/blogs/blogs/thewrongstuff/archive/2010/06/21/hoodoos-hedge-funds-and-alibis-victor-niederhoffer-on-being-wrong.aspx) should be required reading for all investors. One of the most difficult things to do in life is to learn from the mistakes of other people – and while Niederhoffer is famous mostly for his two large blowups, he is also reflective, insightful and a fun read. Perhaps more importantly, outside of those two blowups, Niederhoffer has a superb track record and is highly regarded for his trading skills. Many think that Niederhoffer’s blowups should negate the value of what Niederhoffer says. I think quite the opposite. Here is a trader we can all learn from, including both his successes and his failures.

For instance:

> *“Unfortunately I was so successful for so many years in that particular field that I began to believe in my own success. I thought that because my method worked in markets that I knew about and had quantified, I could apply the same methods to something I didn't know about.”*

 *And later:

 *> *“I didn't have the capital to be strong enough to provide a backup in the case of unforeseen events. I didn't have a proper foundation. I was playing with adversaries who were stronger than me and who actually made the rules. My base of operations was not diversified enough, and I was vulnerable to forces I couldn't withstand. I was too vainglorious. In my opinion, those are recurring errors behind most disasters.”*

But don’t stop at these excerpts. Click through to read the [full interview](http://www.slate.com/blogs/blogs/thewrongstuff/archive/2010/06/21/hoodoos-hedge-funds-and-alibis-victor-niederhoffer-on-being-wrong.aspx) at Slate.

If you are interested in Schulz thinking in a broad range of subjects outside of the investment world, Slate has captured a great deal of her content in her column [The Wrong Stuff](http://www.slate.com/blogs/blogs/thewrongstuff/).

Many others have written about Niederhoffer. One of the better pieces I have encountered is John Cassidy’s lengthy feature in The New Yorker from October 2007 (coincidentally, right at the market top), with the title, [The Blow-Up Artist: Can Victor Niederhoffer Survive Another Market Crisis?](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/10/15/071015fa_fact_cassidy?currentPage=all) Another interesting article about Niederhoffer comes from James Altucher from February of this year and appeared in the Wall Street Journal as [Ten Things I Learned While Trading for Victor Niederhoffer](http://blogs.wsj.com/financial-adviser/2010/02/25/ten-things-i-learned-while-trading-for-victor-niederhoffer/).

Niederhoffer has two books of his own that have quite a few valuable insights:

The prolific Niederhoffer also co-authors the [Daily Speculations](http://www.dailyspeculations.com/wordpress/) blog with Laurel Kenner. I am a big fan of that blog, but feel obliged to comment that the steady stream of content can be a little overwhelming at times.
