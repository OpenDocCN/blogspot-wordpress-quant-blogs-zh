## Rider, Elephants and The Path – Script the Critical Moves

I’ve finally finished [Switch](http://www.amazon.com/Switch-Change-Things-When-Hard/dp/0385528752) – How to change things when change is hard.  Well worth the [read](http://nela1bello.wikispaces.com/file/view/How+to+change+things+when+change+is+hard+.pdf).  There are already quite a few [articles](http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/elephants-riders-and-paths-motivating-students/36030) on the book calling out the [key](http://theleanthinker.com/2011/09/04/switch-how-to-change-things-when-change-is-hard/) points/sections.  However, to remain consistent, I’ll provide my view of the key points, although Lean Thinker does a pretty [good](http://theleanthinker.com/2011/09/04/switch-how-to-change-things-when-change-is-hard/) job 🙂

*   Page 16, “If you want people to change, you must provide crystal-clear direction” – ambiguity is never good, and leads to frustration on both sides
*   Page 17, Three-part framework: Direct the rider, Motivate the Elephant, Shape the Path
*   Page 18, Find the bright spot, and can we do more of it?  Sensible advice.  Retrospectives can benefit from this view.  To often retrospective spend more time high lightening the failures
*   Page 19, Ambiguity is exhausting for the rider, elephants will take the default path.  Its not enough for leaders to set the high level direction.  Change requires details
*   Page 62, Remove ambiguity from the vision
*   Page 81, Rider get lost in analysis. Provide a compelling destination.
*   Page 82, SMART goals – Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, Timely – remove the ambiguity
*   Page 106, See-Feel-Change philosophy
*   Page 120, Burning platform metaphor.  Negative emotions can be powerful
*   Page 126, Motivation through framing via a shorter path.
*   Page 142/144, Shrink the change – or as I often call it, create baby steps that are achievable, and when added together achieve the larger goal
*   Page 168, Act like a coach
*   Page 174, Clear the bar – growth-mindset.  No “Never”, only a “Not yet”
*   Page 212, habit are behavioural autopilot. Stand up meetings 🙂
*   Page 220, the check-list 🙂 Use them to avoid the blind spots in complex environments 🙂
