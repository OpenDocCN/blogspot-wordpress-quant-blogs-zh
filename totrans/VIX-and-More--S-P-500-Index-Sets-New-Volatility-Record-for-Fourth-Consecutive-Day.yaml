    and [implied volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/implied%20volatility)
    as the appropriate yardsticks. One looks backward and is a statistical calculation;
    the other looks forward and lets market participants estimate future volatility.

    it tells you nothing about what has just happened.

    have opined that historical volatility can be as useful in measuring volatility
    as implied volatility.'

    implied volatility and historical volatility (which is simply the standard deviation
    of the log of returns of a period of X days), I am a big fan of [Average True
    Range](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/average%20true%20range), which
    is also known simply as ATR.

    period (most often 14 days), traditionally using an exponential moving average,
    but sometimes using a simple moving average.

    in each of the past four days, the S&P 500 index (SPX) has set new all-time highs
    in its 30 day historical volatility reading, as well as the simple moving average
    version of ATR. Further, if you normalize ATR by dividing it by the daily close
    of the SPX, the past four days have also seen new all-time highs in the normalized
    ATR.'

    such as historical volatility and ATR are continuing to establish new all-time
    highs.
