# Immersive ‚Äì WinC++ and System Language Runtime (SLR) | Tales from a Trading Desk

## Immersive ‚Äì WinC++ and System Language Runtime¬†(SLR)

With [Erich Gamma](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2011/06/10/10171705.aspx) starting at Microsoft as a Distinguished Engineer (August 2011), is C++ the new Microsoft language? The various [speculative](http://channel9.msdn.com/Forums/Coffeehouse/My-prediction-for-the-NET-Windows-8-dev-story-based-on-leaks) postings in the SLR don‚Äôt really provide a clear view as to what Microsoft is thinking. We already know from the various MS Research projects that they are been looking at managed OS‚Äôs in some detail. It‚Äôs a shame that there was no .NET [information](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/windows-8-more-than-just-windows-phone-on-your-pc/9592) around Win8 at the recent conferences, and that we‚Äôre now waiting from the September 2011 Build conference in the hope of getting some clarity.

Why is Microsoft so bad a messaging to Developers these days? Have Google and Apple knocked Microsoft so badly off its game? Didn‚Äôt Microsoft learn anything from the last information nightmare around HTML5 and Silverlight?

Given the limited information around Jupiter and the building of [immersive](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/microsofts-windows-8-and-the-i-word-immersive/9092) applications, could the SLR be part of Jupiter?

> [Jupiter](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/microsoft-needs-to-tell-windows-8-developers-now-about-jupiter-and-silverlight/9608) is a user interface library for Windows and will allow developers to build immersive applications using a XAML-based approach with coming tools from Microsoft.

What is clear (today) is the Silverlight isn‚Äôt dead. It‚Äôs also clear that in the current Win8 [builds](http://forums.mydigitallife.info/threads/26404-Windows-8-%287955%29-Findings-in-M3-Leak?p=441473&viewfull=1#post441473), Silverlight is still very much [alive](http://peteohanlon.wordpress.com/2011/06/03/so-where-do-we-go-from-here/).

So in summary we actually known little or a lot üôÇ Windows 8 will provide great [opportunity](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/what-is-winc-and-how-does-it-figure-in-microsofts-bid-to-make-tools-a-2-billion-business/9359), but in the (financial) corporate space with the current Windows 7 roll-out still underway (or not started) we‚Äôre not going to get Windows 8 ‚Äúcoolness‚Äù for a number of years.
