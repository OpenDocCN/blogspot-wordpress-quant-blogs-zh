# AI Chatbots | Tales from a Trading Desk

## AI Chatbots

“Deep Learning For [Chatbots](http://www.wildml.com/2016/04/deep-learning-for-chatbots-part-1-introduction/#more-750), Part 1 – Introduction” provides a good overview on the techniques needed to develop your own [chatbot](https://chatbotsmagazine.com/the-complete-beginner-s-guide-to-chatbots-8280b7b906ca#.5sh6bw62p).  Clearly, a closed domain problem is easier.

Microsoft’s [Bot](https://dev.botframework.com/) Framework also provide some good resources.  Particularly nice, is that fact that Bot [Builder](http://docs.botframework.com/builder/node/overview/) is Node.js.  Microsoft has gone for one approach to understanding natural language – [LUIS](http://docs.botframework.com/builder/node/guides/understanding-natural-language/#navtitle).

[Botkit](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit) also looks interesting, but doesn’t seem to have that complex a NLP ability.

[ChatterBot](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ChatterBot/0.4.2) has a training mode.  I’ve not used it, but it would be interest for example, to play in traders Bloomberg conversations or similar, and see how the bot faired 🙂
