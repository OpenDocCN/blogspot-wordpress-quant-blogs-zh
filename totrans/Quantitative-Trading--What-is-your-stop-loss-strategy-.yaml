- en: A reader recently asked me whether setting a stop loss for a trading strategy
    is a good idea. I am a big fan of setting stop loss, but there are certainly myriad
    views on this.

- en: 'One of my former bosses didn''t believe in stop loss: his argument is that
    the market does not care about your personal entry price, so your stop price may
    be somebody else’s entry point. So stop loss, to him, is irrational. Since he
    is running a portfolio with hundreds of positions, he doesn’t regard preserving
    capital in just one or a few specific positions to be important. Of course, if
    you are an individual trader with fewer than a hundred positions, preservation
    of capital becomes a lot more important, and so does stop loss.'

    positions is not important, are there situations where stop loss is rational?
    I certainly think that applies to trend-following strategies. Whenever you incur
    a big loss when you have a trend-following position, it ususally means that the
    latest entry signal is opposite to your original entry signal. In this case, better
    admit your mistake, close your position, and maybe even enter into the opposite
    side. (Sometimes I wish our politicians think this way.) On the other hand, if
    you employ a mean-reverting strategy, and instead of reverting, the market sticks
    to its original direction and causes you to lose money, does it mean you are wrong?
    Not necessarily: you could simply be too early. Indeed, many traders in this case
    will double up their position, since the latest entry signal in this case is in
    the same direction as the original one. This raises a question though: if incurring
    a big loss is not a good enough reason to surrender to the market, how would you
    ever decide if your mean-reverting model is wrong? Here I propose a stop loss
    criterion that looks at another dimension: time.'

    formula](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornstein-Uhlenbeck_process). As a concrete
    example, I will apply this model to the commodity ETF spreads I discussed before
    that I believe are mean-reverting ([XLE-CL](http://epchan.blogspot.com/2006/11/cointegration-of-oih-with-spot-oil.html),
    [GDX-GLD](http://epchan.blogspot.com/2006/11/reader-suggested-possible-trading.html),
    [EEM-IGE](http://epchan.blogspot.com/2006/11/does-canada-belong-to-emerging-markets.html),
    and [EWC-IGE](http://epchan.blogspot.com/2006/11/does-canada-belong-to-emerging-markets.html)).
    It is a simple model that says the next change in the spread is opposite in sign
    to the deviation of the spread from its long-term mean, with a magnitude that
    is proportional to the deviation. In our case, this proportionality constant θ
    can be estimated from a linear regression of the daily change of the spread versus
    the spread itself. Most importantly for us, if we solve this equation, we will
    find that the deviation from the mean exhibits an exponential decay towards zero,
    with the half-life of the decay equals ln(2)/θ. This half-life is an important
    number: it gives us an estimate of how long we should expect the spread to remain
    far from zero. If we enter into a mean-reverting position, and 3 or 4 half-life’s
    later the spread still has not reverted to zero, we have reason to believe that
    maybe the regime has changed, and our mean-reverting model may not be valid anymore
    (or at least, the spread may have acquired a new long-term mean.)'

    for traders, as it reverts the fastest, while the XLE-CL spread is the most trying.
    If we arbitrarily decide that we will exit a spread once we have held it for 3
    times the half-life, we have to hold the XLE-CL spread almost a calendar year
    before giving up. (Note that the half-life count only trading days.) And indeed,
    while I have entered and exited (profitably) the GDX-GLD spread several times
    since last summer, I am holding the XLE - QM (substituting QM for CL) spread for
    the 104^(th) day!
