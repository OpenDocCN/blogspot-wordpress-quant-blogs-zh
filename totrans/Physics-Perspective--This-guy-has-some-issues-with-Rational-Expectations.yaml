- en: from a couple years ago featuring a number of economists involved with the Rational
    Expectations movement, either as key proponents (Robert Lucas) or critics (Bob
    Shiller). A fascinating exchange comes late on when they discuss Jack Muth --
    ostensibly the inventor of the idea, although others trace it back to an early
    paper of Herb Simon -- and Muth's later attitude on this assumption. It seems
    that Muth came to doubt the usefulness of the idea after he looked at the behaviour
    of some business firms and found that they didn't seem to follow the Rational
    Expectations paradigm at all. He thought, therefore, that it would make sense
    to employ some more plausible and realistic ideas about how people form expectations,
    and he pointed, even in the early 1980s, to the work of Kahneman and Tversky.

    Shiller who makes the fairly obvious point that if economics is about human behavior
    and how it influences economic outcomes, then there clearly ought to be a progressive
    interchange between psychology and economics, and from Lucas who, amazingly enough,
    seems to find this idea utterly abhorrent, apparently because it may spoil economics
    as a pure mathematical playground. That''s my reading at least:'

    because he died just as Hurricane Wilma was zeroing in on his home on the Florida
    Keys. But he did send me a letter in 1984\. This was a letter in response to an
    earlier draft of that paper you are referring to. I sent Jack my paper with some
    trepidation because it was not encouraging to his theory. And much to my surprise,
    he wrote back. This was in October 1984\. And he said, I came up with some conclusions
    similar to some of yours on the basis of forecasts of business activity compiled
    by the Bureau of Business Research at Pitt. [Letter Muth to Lovell (2 October
    1984)] He had got hold of the data from five business firms, including expectations
    data, analyzed it, and found that the rational expectations model did not pass
    the empirical test.

    rational expectations have never really been proposed. My original paper was largely
    a reaction against very näıve expectations hypotheses juxtaposed with highly
    rational decision-making behavior and seems to have been rather widely misinterpreted.
    Two directions seem to be worth exploring: (1) explaining why smoothing rules
    work and their limitations and (2) incorporating well known cognitive biases into
    expectations theory (Kahneman and Tversky). It was really incredible that so little
    has been done along these lines.”'

    with the facts about forecasts of demand and production. He then advanced an alternative
    to rational expectations. That alternative he called an “errors-in-the-variables”
    model. That is to say, it allowed the expectation error to be correlated with
    both the realization and the prediction. Muth found that his errors-in-variables
    model worked better than rational expectations or Mills’ implicit expectations,
    but it did not entirely pass the tests. In a shortened version of his paper published
    in the Eastern Economic Journal he reported,

    extrapolative, regressive, or rational models. Only the expectations revision
    model used by Meiselman is consistently supported by the statistical results.
    . . . These conclusions should be regarded as highly tentative and only suggestive,
    however, because of the small number of firms studied. [Muth (1985, p. 200)]

    going to have rational behavioral equations, then consistency requires that our
    model include rational expectations. But he was also interested in the results
    of people who do behavioral economics, which at that time was a very undeveloped
    area.

    the problem of regime change, and that makes them hard to apply. It’s the same
    criticism they make of Kahnemann and Tversky, that the model isn’t clear and crisp
    about exactly how you should apply it. Well, the same is true for rational expectations
    models. And there’s a new strand of thought that’s getting impetus lately, that
    the failure to predict this crisis was a failure to understand regime changes.
    The title of a recent book by Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff—the title of the
    book is This Time Is Different—to me invokes this problem of regime change, that
    people don’t know when there’s a regime change, and they may assume regime changes
    too often—that’s a behavioral bias [Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff (2009)].
    I don’t know how we’re going to model that. Reinhart and Rogoff haven’t come forth
    with any new answers, but that’s what comes to my mind now, at this point in history.
    And I don’t know whether you can comment on it: how do we handle the regime change
    problem? If you don’t have data on subprime mortgages then you build a model that
    doesn’t have subprime mortgages in it. Also, it doesn’t have the shadow banking
    sector in it either. Omitting key variables because we don’t have the data history
    on them creates a fundamental problem That’s why many nice concepts don’t find
    their way into empirical models and are not used more. They remain just a conceptual
    model.'

    world were stable, then rational expectations means simply agents learning about
    their environment and applying what they learned to their decisions. If the environment’s
    simple, then how else would you structure the model? It’s precisely—if you like,
    call it “regime change”—what do you do with unanticipated events? More generally—regime
    changes is only one of them—you were talking about institutional change that was
    or wasn’t anticipated. As a theorist, I don’t know how to handle that.

- en: No. I mean, you can’t read Muth’s paper as some recipe for cranking out true
    theories about everything under the sun—we don’t have a recipe like that. My paper
    on expectations and the neutrality of money was an attempt to get a positive theory
    about what observations we call a Phillips curve. Basically it didn’t work. After
    several years, trying to push that model in a direction of being more operational,
    it didn’t seem to explain it. So we had what we call price stickiness, which seems
    to be central to the way the system works. I thought my model was going to explain
    price stickiness, and it didn’t. So we’re still working on it; somebody’s working
    on it. I don’t think we have a satisfactory solution to that problem, but I don’t
    think that’s a cloud over Muth’s work. If Jack thinks it is, I don’t agree with
    him. Mike cites some data that Jack couldn’t make sense out of using rational
    expectations. . . . There’re a lot of bad models out there. I authored my share,
    and I don’t see how that affects a lot of things we’ve been talking about earlier
    on about the value of Muth’s contribution.

    in general provide a useful and viable alternative to rational expectations, with
    the emphasis on “useful”?

- en: Well, that’s the criticism of behavioral economics, that it doesn’t provide
    elegant models. If you read Kahnemann and Tversky, they say that preferences have
    a kink in them, and that kink moves around depending on framing. But framing is
    hard to pin down. So we don’t have any elegant behavioral economics models. The
    job isn’t done, and economists have to read widely and think about these issues.
    I am sorry, I don’t have a good answer. My opinion is that behavioral economics
    has to be on the reading list. Ultimately, the whole rationality assumption is
    another thing; it’s interesting to look back on the history of it. Back at the
    turn of the century—around 1900—when utility-maximizing economic theory was being
    discovered, it was described as a psychological theory—did you know that, that
    utility maximization was a psychological theory? There was a philosopher in 1916—I
    remember reading, in the Quarterly Journal of Economics —who said that the economics
    profession is getting steadily more psychological. {laughter} And what did he
    mean? He said that economists are putting people at the center of the economy,
    and they’re realizing that people have purposes and they have objectives and they
    have trade-offs. It is not just that I want something, I’ll consider different
    combinations and I’ll tell you what I like about that. And he’s saying that before
    this happened, economists weren’t psychological; they believed in such things
    as gold or venerable institutions, and they didn’t talk about people. Now the
    whole economics profession is focused on people. And he said that this is a long-term
    trend in economics. And it is a long-term trend, so the expected utility theory
    is a psychological theory, and it reflects some important insights about people.
    In a sense, that’s all we have, behavioral economics; and it’s just that we are
    continuing to develop and to pursue it. The idea about rational expectations,
    again, reflects insights about people—that if you show people recurring patterns
    in the data, they can actually process it—a little bit like an ARIMA model—and
    they can start using some kind of brain faculties that we do not fully comprehend.
    They can forecast—it’s an intuitive thing that evolved and it’s in our psychology.
    So, I don’t think that there’s a conflict between behavioral economics and classical
    economics. It’s all something that will evolve responding to each other—psychology
    and economics.

    a student of Simon and [Richard] March and [James] Cyert—in fact, I was even a
    research assistant on A Behavioral Theory of the Firm [Cyert and March (1963)].
    So we talked about that in those days too. I am much less up on modern behavioral
    economics. However, I think what you are referring to are those aspects of psychology
    that illustrate the limits, if you like, of perception and, say, cognitive ability.
    Well, Simon did talk about that too—he didn’t use those precise words. What I
    do see on the question of expectations—right down the hall from me—is my colleague
    Chuck Manksi [Charles Manksi] and a group of people that he’s associated with.
    They’re trying to deal with expectations of ordinary people. For a lot of what
    we are talking about in macroeconomics, we’re thinking of decision-makers sure
    that they have all the appropriate data and have a sophisticated view about that
    data. You can’t carry that model of the decision-maker over to many household
    decisions. And what’s coming out of this new empirical research on expectations
    is precisely that: how do people think about the uncertainties that go into deciding
    about what their pension plan is going to look like. I think that those are real
    issues, where behavioral economics, in that sense, can make a very big contribution
    to what the rest of us do.'

    of people, say, 280 million people are going to respond if you change something
    in the tax structure, something in the inflation rate, or whatever. Now, human
    beings are hugely interesting creatures; so neurophysiology is exciting, cognitive
    psychology is interesting—I’m still into Freudian psychology—there are lots of
    different ways to look at individual people and lots of aspects of individual
    people that are going to be subject to scientific study. Kahnemann and Tversky
    haven’t even gotten to two people; they can’t even tell us anything interesting
    about how a couple that’s been married for ten years splits or makes decisions
    about what city to live in—let alone 250 million. This is like saying that we
    ought to build it up from knowledge of molecules or—no, that won’t do either,
    because there are a lot of subatomic particles—we’re not going to build up useful
    economics in the sense of things that help us think about the policy issues that
    we should be thinking about starting from individuals and, somehow, building it
    up from there. Behavioral economics should be on the reading list. I agree with
    Shiller about that. A well-trained economist or a well-educated person should
    know something about different ways of looking at human beings. If you are going
    to go back and look at Herb Simon today, go back and read Models of Man. But to
    think of it as an alternative to what macroeconomics or public finance people
    are doing or trying to do . . . there’s a lot of stuff that we’d like to improve—it’s
    not going to come from behavioral economics. . . at least in my lifetime. {laughter}

    Akerlof, is called Animal Spirits [2009]. And we presented an idea that Bob Lucas
    probably won’t like. It was something about the Keynesian concept. Another name
    that’s not been mentioned is John Maynard Keynes. I suspect that he’s not popular
    with everyone on this panel. Animal Spirits is based on Keynes. He said that animal
    spirits is a major driver of the economy. To understand Keynes, you have to go
    back to his 1921 book, Treatise on Probability [Keynes (1921)]. He said—he’s really
    into almost this regime-change thing that we brought up before—that people don’t
    have probabilities, except in very narrow, special circumstances. You can think
    of a coin-toss experiment, and then you know what the probabilities are. But in
    macroeconomics, it’s always fuzzy. What Keynes said in The General Theory [1936]
    is that, if people are really thoroughly rational, they would be paralyzed into
    inaction, because they just don’t know. They don’t know the kind of things that
    you would need to put into a decision-theory framework. But they do act, and so
    there is something that drives people—it’s animal spirits. You’re lying in bed
    in the morning and you could be thinking, “I don’t know what’s going to happen
    to me today; I could get hit by a truck; I just will stay in bed all day.” But
    you don’t. So animal spirits is the core of—maybe I’m telling this too bluntly—but
    it fluctuates. Sometimes it is represented as confidence, but it is not necessarily
    confidence. It is trust in each other, our sense of whether other people think
    that we’re moving ahead or . . . something like that. I believe that’s part of
    what drives the economy. It’s in our book, and it’s not very well modeled yet.
    But Keynes never wrote his theory down as a model either. He couldn’t do it; he
    wasn’t ready. These are ideas that, even to this day, are fuzzy. But they have
    a hold on people. I’m sure that Ben Bernanke and Austin Goolsbee are influenced
    by John Maynard Keynes, who was absolutely not a rational-expectations theorist.
    And that’s another strand of thought. In my mind, the strands are not resolved,
    and they are both important ways of looking at the world.
