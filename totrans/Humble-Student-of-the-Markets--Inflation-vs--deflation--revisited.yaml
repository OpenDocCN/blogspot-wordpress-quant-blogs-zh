    of official policy (low rates, quantitative easing, big deficits) looks inflationary
    but the economic fundamentals (a big output gap, sluggish credit growth) look
    deflationary. ***Faced with this dichotomy, investors who buy both Treasury bonds
    and gold are not displaying cognitive dissonance. They are just hedging their
    bets.***

- en: The source of my concern about long-run inflation comes not from the expansion
    of the Fed's balance sheet, but instead from worries about the ability of the
    U.S. government to fund its fiscal expenditures and debt-servicing obligations
    as we get another 5 or 10 years down the current path. Just as many analysts have
    had trouble seeing how Greece can reasonably be expected over the near term to
    move to primary surpluses sufficient to meet its growing debt servicing costs,
    I have similar problems squaring the numbers for the U.S. looking a little farther
    ahead.

    be a flight from the dollar by international lenders, leading to depreciation
    of the exchange rate, increase in the dollar price of traded goods, and possible
    sharp challenges for rolling over U.S. Treasury debt. We've of course been seeing
    the exact opposite of this over the last few months, as worries in Europe and
    elsewhere have resulted in a flight to the dollar and the perceived safety of
    U.S. Treasuries. That appreciation of the dollar has been one factor keeping U.S.
    inflation down. So any inflation scare is clearly not an incipient development,
    but instead something we'd possibly face farther down the road.

    possibility of government default. They also will tend to slow the economy, unless
    the tax increases stem from cutting cheating, and the budget cuts affect only
    things that are a fraudulent waste.
