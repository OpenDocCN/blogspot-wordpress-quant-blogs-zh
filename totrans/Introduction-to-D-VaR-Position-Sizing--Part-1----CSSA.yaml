    too busy looking for the ultimate trading strategies or indicators to bother with
    spending time thinking about how much to bet. Contrary to what you might think,
    figuring out how much you should bet is not just a matter of determining your
    expected edge. Unlike casino games with defined odds, markets are uncertain and
    adjusting for the unexpected tail loss is just as important as adjusting for the 
    expected size of your edge.

- en: This concept is not new to hedge funds, and to those that trade for a living;
    They often think about risk first because their continued existence depends on
    staying in the game. For this sophisticated bunch, position-sizing, diversification,
    and hedging are the cornerstones of their risk management approach. Many of them
    are well aware that initial stop losses (in contrast to trailing stops which are
    very useful) are highly overrated as a means of managing risk–and if used improperly
    will increase your chances of going broke. This is because if they are placed
    too tight they will protect you from tail risk but expose you to more noise. If
    they are place too far the reverse is true– especially with unexpected gaps. 
    The tradeoff is simple:  death by one severe blow, or death by a thousand cuts.
    Finding the optimal balance is very difficult. Initial stops are not sufficient
    to manage risk by themselves and function much better when they are integrated
    with other risk management tools. In contrast, position sizing is very useful
    since you a) don’t face timing risk and b) can only lose what is invested–if you
    bet 5% of your portfolio no surprise gaps will lead you to losing more than you
    have bet.

    has been published somewhere before. However I do know that it is based on the
    well-known concept of “Value-at-Risk.”  From Investopedia this is defined as follows

    in trading energy and other commodities. VaR is able to measure risk while it
    happens and is an important consideration when firms make trading or hedging decisions.

- en: Generally speaking VaR looks at tail risk ,which in the industry is defined
    by the magnitude of expected losses at the 95th percentile (or 5% percentile of
    the daily P/L distribution of any strategy). Knowing the maximum losses that 
    might occur in extreme circumstances helps risk management professionals prepare
    for the worst. If you know what % risk your portfolio may incur you can theoretically
    budget your portfolio or individual stock position sizing to allow for a given
    maximum. Conventional practice is to use a normal distribution for this this task–
    all that needs to be known is the mean and standard deviation and this estimate
    can easily be derived. Unfortunately for the slide-rule boys, financial markets
    are really not normally distributed and tend to exhibit “fat tails.” What this
    means is that the maximum risk (or upside) is actually both more probable and
    larger than what would be expected in a utopian trading universe.  This means
    that typical volatility-based position sizing inherently rests on a shaky foundation.
    (more on this later) Why not simply look at the empirical distribution of daily
    returns? After all, our own empirical observation tells us that normal distributions
    are flawed, so why not manage risk based on experience?

- en: As you can see, both goals are achieved– D-VaR shows much lower tail risk and
    a higher sharpe ratio. As a side bonus, it actually produces a higher CAGR than
    buy and hold. From the crash of 1929,the crash of 1987, the Asian crisis in 1998,
    to October 2008, D-Var survived them all with limited tail risk without any use
    of timing related tools. This makes it a definite candidate as a new position
    sizing method that works in real-life. In subsequent posts I will give some more
    examples how this can be used in basic trading strategies that are both long and
    short.
