    Small Cap Sentiment and a Significant VIX Move](http://www.schaeffersresearch.com/commentary/observations.aspx?ID=20478&c=berniefeed),
    Bernie Schaeffer opines that last week’s VIX close below the 32-week simple moving
    average could signal the same sort of “all clear” message that a similar VIX close
    did in August 2006\.'

    front, Schaeffer also looked at Friday’s action and noted that “the SPX rallying
    more than 0.85% while the VIX drops less than 10% - has had historically bullish
    implications dating back to 1990\. Specifically, after 20 days the market is higher
    69% of the time; the average gain in the SPX over this period is 1.65%.”

    the right hand column of the blog to several important voices who frequently talk
    about the VIX and market sentiment.  The links to “Other Important Voices” can
    be found just below “Blogs I Frequent” section and currently includes the likes
    of Bernie Schaeffer, Larry Connors, Fred Ruffy, Jay Kaeppel, and Mark Hulbert.
