- en: The Chinese authorities were stuck between a rock and a hard place. On one hand,
    COVID caseloads were skyrocketing; on the other hand, after two years of a series
    of on-again-off-again of lockdowns, it was unsurprising that Chinese citizens,
    many of them young, got a case of cabin fever and protested the government's COVID
    policies in a series of nationwide demonstrations. A

  zh: 中国当局左右为难。一方面，COVID 病例激增；另一方面，经历了两年的一系列断断续续的封锁后，毫不奇怪，许多年轻的中国公民对政府的 COVID 政策感到不满，并在全国范围内举行了一系列抗议活动。

- en: Two incidents were believed to be the final straws that were the catalysts for
    the unrest. The first was an apartment fire in the city of Urumqi in western Xinjiang,
    where 10 people died, in which fire exits were locked because of COVID restrictions
    that trapped occupants inside, and COVID barriers prevented firefighters from
    reaching the building. In addition, broadcasts of the World Cup showed numerous
    unmasked spectators in the stands, which ran counter to the government’s narrative
    that China was controlling the pandemic much better than the West.

  zh: 两起事件被认为是引发动荡的最后一根稻草。第一起是新疆西部乌鲁木齐市的一起公寓火灾，造成10人死亡，火灾出口因为 COVID 限制而被锁住，困住了居民，COVID
    隔离设施阻止了消防队员到达建筑物。此外，世界杯的广播显示了许多没有戴口罩的观众，这与政府声称中国比西方国家更好地控制了疫情的说法相矛盾。
- en: Protests are relatively common in China, but it's rare to see them erupt spontaneously
    and in different cities. While the authorities appear to have the protests under

    almost unraveled China.
