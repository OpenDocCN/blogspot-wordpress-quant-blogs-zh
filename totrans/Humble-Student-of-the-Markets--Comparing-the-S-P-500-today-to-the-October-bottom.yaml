    territory. But how oversold, as oversold markets have been known to fall further.
    I compare the current technical conditions to the market bottom of October 2022.

- en: Consider, for example, the Zweig Breadth Thrust Indicator. The ZBT buy signal
    is triggered when the ZBT Indicator moves from oversold to overbought within 10
    trading days, which is a rare display of price momentum. Nevertheless, investors
    can use the ZBT Indicator as a short-term trading signal to spot entry points
    on the long side. As the accompanying chart shows, oversold conditions on this
    indicator always resolved in a short-term bounce, with no guarantee of a sustainable
    rally. The market did become oversold on this indicator last week, but levels
    were not as severe as the October bottom. In fact, the October bottom was a complex
    bottom, with the market becoming initially oversold, rallied, fell to another
    oversold condition, rallied again and weakened to the final bottom. The bottom
    was signaled by a positive divergence in the ZBT Indicator. None of that is in
    evidence today.
