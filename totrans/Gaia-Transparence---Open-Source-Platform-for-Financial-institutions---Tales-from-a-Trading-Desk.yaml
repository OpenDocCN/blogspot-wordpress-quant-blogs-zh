- en: Interesting to see the [adoption](http://www.gaiatransparence.com/) of this
    platform (video [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAg-gL6mkiM)).  Essentially
    the platform offers an integrated trading, risk and processing for financial products. 
    The [catalogue](http://www.gaiatransparence.com/catalogue.html) provides a view
    of the components the platform will possibly offer in the future, leaning on cloud
    and GPU where appropriate.  Primarily the platform is going after the opportunity
    created by the new regulatory requirements including CCP margining, CVA, MIFID2,
    and Basle3, coupled with the history of the [CDS Price](http://www.cdsmodel.com/cdsmodel/)
    issued by the ISDA under Open Source.

- en: Gaia Transparence “Open Source Community” page provides the usual suspects,
    coupled with a link to Lodestone.  I wonder if the Deutsche [Lodestone](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/6ee1921c-f14f-11e1-a553-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2QoRMZll7)
    initiative is being leveraged by Gaia Transparence?
