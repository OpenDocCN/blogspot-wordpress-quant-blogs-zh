- en: There are a number of plausible explanations for the market reaction, but they
    could amount to little more than rationalizations. First, the EBA effectively
    nixed the carry trade by requiring banks to mark-to-market, so much of that €489
    billion amounted to liquidity injections into the eurozone banking system. If
    the banks need that much liquidity, what could they be hiding? Or does this just
    show that the European banking system is just getting by on ECB life support?

    the table. Maybe the markets are now finally focusing on what typically matters,
    such as earnings, growth, interest rates, etc. and it didn't like what it saw?
