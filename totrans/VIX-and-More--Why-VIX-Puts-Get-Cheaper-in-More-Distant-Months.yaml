- en: Today I fielded several questions related to the valuation of VIX puts – a subject
    that can be a head-scratcher for even the most seasoned investors.

    shows bid-ask quotes for VIX puts from July (which expire at tomorrow’s open)
    through December.

    17s the prices for August through December have already factored in some mean
    reversion. For this reason, the August 17s are the most expensive on the board,
    with a bid-ask midpoint of 1.05\. The September 17s are quoted at 0.875; the October
    17s are at 0.75; and both the November and December 17s are at 0.675.

- en: One way to interpret this put matrix is that if you were to pick any month other
    than the current one that the VIX is most likely to close below 17, then August
    is your month. Additionally, if you expect to get any money for selling VIX 17
    puts, then August is the best month to target.  This is because the moneyness
    of the VIX options considers the full VIX term structure and with the VIX futures
    in steep contango, the back months are a full nine points higher than the front
    month (July) VIX futures.

    with VIX puts. In fact, the best way to think about these trades is to consider
    them not to be spreads based on one underlying, but two different trades based
    on two different underlyings: the [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures)
    for each corresponding month. This details of this subject is fodder for another
    post.]*'

- en: Finally, for those who might consider selling VIX puts – always an interesting
    strategy, but often with surprisingly little premium involved – the key risk management
    concept to consider is that the direction of the spike in the VIX is almost always
    to the upside and only rarely to the downside. Short of a QE3 announcement, it
    is difficult to anticipate the type of news which would push the VIX under 15.00
    for an extended period.
