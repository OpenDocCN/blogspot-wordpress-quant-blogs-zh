- en: Launched just two weeks ago, [VXX options](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX%20options)
    have already attracted a great deal of interest, averaging approximately 17,000
    contracts traded per day. While this number is impressive for such a short period
    of time, it still pales when compared to the 260,000 or so contracts in VIX options
    that are traded on a typical day.

- en: As the chart of the week below (which uses [VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX)
    data from May 23 to the present) shows, VXX call volume has been running at about
    twice the rate of VXX put volume. It is far too early to determine whether VXX
    options data may flag smart money or dumb money, but it is worth noting at this
    juncture that the biggest spike in VXX call volume (green bars at bottom) preceded
    a nice jump in VXX. On the other hand, the second biggest single day volume in
    VXX calls came last Wednesday, the day before the SPX jumped 3.0% and caused volatility
    to plummet.

    particularly as VXX options can be used in combination with the underlying, the
    VXX ETN.
