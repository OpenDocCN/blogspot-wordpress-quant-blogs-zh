    investors to beat the market and for hedge funds to make any money because of

    and the risk-on trade, against TLT, which represents long Treasury bonds and the
    risk-off trade. I have overlaid on top a short horizoned RSI indicator of 7 days.
    Note how it has been profitable to sell stocks and buy bonds when RSI approaches
    the 60-65 level and buy stocks and sell bonds RSI goes below 30.

    decelerating after a period of acceleration that began in mid-2010\. Everything
    else being equal, an environment of slowing money supply growth usually provide
    headwinds to further advances in equity prices.
