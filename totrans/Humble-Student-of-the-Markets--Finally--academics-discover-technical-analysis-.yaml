    ability of technical analysis. They apply their method to portfolios arranged
    by idiosyncratic volatility and variables related to information uncertainty.
    They document high abnormal returns relative to standard pricing models that are
    unexplained by investor sentiment, market timing, or liquidity risk. Such findings,
    according to the authors, establish a new anomaly.

- en: The authors use a set of 10 volatility decile portfolios as the underlying assets
    for their technical analysis. For each of the portfolios, the authors focus on
    the cross-sectional profitability of the MA timing strategy relative to that of
    the buy-and-hold strategy of the volatility decile portfolios. In the main study,
    the lag length is 10 days. The authors also test the alternative strategy with
    lag lengths of 20, 50, 100, and 200 days for the MA portfolios (MAPs).

    volatility deciles (excluding the highest decile); returns range from 8.42% a
    year to 18.70% a year. In addition, the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) risk-adjusted
    returns, or abnormal returns, increase with the volatility deciles (also excluding
    the highest decile), ranging from 9.31% a year to 21.76% a year. When the authors
    apply the Fama–French three-factor model, they find the familiar pattern of monotonically
    increasing returns across 9 of 10 volatility deciles.

- en: A few years ago, I managed equity market neutral portfolios at a firm that was
    mainly known for commodity trading using trend following techniques, which are
    well described by [Michael Covel](https://www.blogger.com/) in his book. During
    my tenure there I noticed that while the commodity positions were spread out among
    various futures contracts they often amounted to a few macro bets (i.e. on interest
    rates, on the US$, etc.) ***I came to the conclusion that these models were identifying
    macroeconomic trends that are persistent and exhibit serial correlation, which
    creates investment opportunities for patient long-term investors.*** For example,
    if the Fed is raising rates the odds are they will continue to raise rates until
    they signal a neutral or easing bias, i.e. there is a trend to interest rates,
    which is information that investors can use. The key risk in this class of models
    is knowing when to exit the trend, as short and long term reversals can be devastating
    to the bottom line.

    do not work well in trend-less markets as these kinds of models are suspectible
    to whipsaw. (That`s a feature, not a bug.)

    shows, up-and-down stock markets in Q1 resulted in negative returns for the account
    - a classic whipsaw pattern.

    following principles to global equity and commodity prices. The chart below shows
    the actual real-time (not back-tested) buy and sell signals of the model. I further
    highlighted the instances when the model suffered from whipsaw. To address that
    problem, I supplement the trend following model signals with some short-term sentiment
    models in order to address the whipsaw problem of this class of modeling technique.

    technical analysis can produce superior risk-adjusted returns. Further, if academics
    were to further decompose capital market returns in an economic, instead of Fama-French,
    risk factor mapping, I bet that they will find that these kinds of models are
    picking up on the serial correlation in economic factor returns.
