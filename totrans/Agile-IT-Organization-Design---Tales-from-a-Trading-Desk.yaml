    for some time, but never managed to quick complete the book due to time.  Interestingly,
    at the Construx Executive [Summit](http://www.construx.com/Thought_Leadership/Events/Software_Executive_Summit/?id=16269)
    last week, one of the discussion group was centred around Organizational Structures

    metrics.  Unfortunately software engineering is a social activity, and doesn’t
    lend itself very well to measurements.  This subject again ties nicely back to
