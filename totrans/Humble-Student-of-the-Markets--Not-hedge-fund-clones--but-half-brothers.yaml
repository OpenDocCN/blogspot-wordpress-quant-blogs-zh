    where the house has no advantage and I told you that I was going to bet a controlled
    amount once a day on a spin and invest the remainder in T-Bills. Such an investment
    would be uncorrelated to virtually any asset class that you can think of and would
    have highly diversifying characteristics, but would have no alpha.

    How big a bet is it? Does it represent 0.1% of his portfolio or 10%? Focusing
    on picks ignores all the other parts of portfolio management (see my previous

    AlphaClone pays attention to the weightings in the portfolio but a lack of attention
