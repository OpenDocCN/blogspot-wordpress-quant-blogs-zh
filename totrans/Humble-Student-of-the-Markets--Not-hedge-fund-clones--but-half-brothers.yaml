    in hedge funds as pure alpha vehicles (hence the high fees), not because of their
    correlation characteristics.

    where the house has no advantage and I told you that I was going to bet a controlled
    amount once a day on a spin and invest the remainder in T-Bills. Such an investment
    would be uncorrelated to virtually any asset class that you can think of and would
    have highly diversifying characteristics, but would have no alpha.

    the holdings only, without paying attention to the weight. For example, Julian
    Robertson [reportedly entered into a yield steepener trade](http://www.marketfolly.com/2009/06/julian-robertsons-steepener-swap-play.html).
    How big a bet is it? Does it represent 0.1% of his portfolio or 10%? Focusing
    on picks ignores all the other parts of portfolio management (see my previous
    comments [here](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2008/01/what-do-you-do-after-youve-made-your.html),

    and Dash of Insight also has a timely [post](http://oldprof.typepad.com/a_dash_of_insight/2009/10/etf-update-why-weighting-is-important.html)
    on the importance of weighting differences between ETFs. I don’t know how much
    AlphaClone pays attention to the weightings in the portfolio but a lack of attention
    to weighting can prove to be a problem. One solution is to reverse engineer a
    manager’s macro factor exposures like I have [here](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2008/06/bill-miller-ken-heebner-study-in.html).'

    in hedge fund replications, but it doesn’t get you all the way there. What you
    get is more like a half-brother rather than a true clone.

    is to buy them, rather than to try to clone them. Whether the difference between
    AlphaClone like approaches and directly buying the funds is worth the 2 and 20
    fees is up to you.
