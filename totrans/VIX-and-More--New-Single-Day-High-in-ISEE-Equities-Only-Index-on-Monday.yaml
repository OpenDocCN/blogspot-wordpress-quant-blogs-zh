- en: To recap for those who may not be familiar with the ISEE, this ratio was developed
    by the International Securities Exchange (ISE) and is calculated by dividing opening
    long call options bought by ISE customers by opening long put options bought by
    ISE customers, then multiplied by 100\. The ‘equities only’ slice of the full
    transaction pie means that all trades with indices and ETPs are excluded from
    this data, which also reduces the likelihood that any of the ISEE equities only
    data includes trades intended largely as portfolio hedges.

    as many calls as puts. Because there tends to be a lot of noise in the daily data,
    I like to average the data over a 10-day period. The chart below shows the ISEE
    equities only index since July 2011, along with the 10-day moving average.

    that flags when the masses are becoming overly exuberant or fearful and on Monday
    at least, exuberance – rational or otherwise – was running rampant, perhaps over
    the excitement of growing evidence of possible QE3 activity and a [Bernanke put](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Bernanke%20put)
    in general.

- en: For what it is worth, the prior single day high in the ISEE equities only index
    dates from December 2010, when stocks were in the middle of a six-month bull move
    that resembles the current move in several respects and carried the SPX from 1039
    to 1344.
