**Mid-week market update**

: It is said that there is nothing more bullish a stock or an index can do other than to make new highs. Both the DJIA and the SPX made fresh all-time highs today. While that may appear to be bullish, there are plenty of warning signs beneath the surface that this advance may not be entirely sustainable.

One of the missing ingredients in this rally is momentum. The SPX is exhibiting a negative 5-day RSI divergence, indicating flagging momentum even as the index made new highs. In addition, the VIX Index fell below its lower Bollinger Band, indicating an extremely overbought condition.
