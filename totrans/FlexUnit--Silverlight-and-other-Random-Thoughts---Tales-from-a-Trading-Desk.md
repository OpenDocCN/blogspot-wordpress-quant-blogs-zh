## FlexUnit, Silverlight and other Random¬†Thoughts

*   [FlexUnit](http://weblogs.macromedia.com/amcleod/archives/2008/08/flexunit_on_ado.html) is now out in Open Source land. Hopefully Adobe can begin to provide more enterprise development tools. The one downside of FlexUnit is that there appears to be no console mode, which is unfortunate is your running on an enterprise build plant üò¶
*   No surprises in this [list](http://blogs.msdn.com/swiss_dpe_team/archive/2008/08/26/cool-ria-silverlight-demo-applications.aspx) of Silverlight RIA applications. It‚Äôs unfortunate that the RIA I was instrumental in building last year isn‚Äôt in this list üò¶
*   [Oslo](http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/rojacobs/endpointtv-The-Road-to-Oslo/) insights
*   Looks like Steve had to pull the [BWM](https://blogs.msdn.com/stevecla01/archive/2008/08/21/bmw-playing-with-microsoft-surface.aspx) surface video :(, but at least there are a number of other Vectorform [Surface](http://www.vectorform.com/surface/) video‚Äôs still online ‚Äì Mercedes-Benz etc
*   REST with [WCF](http://blogs.msdn.com/dotnetinterop/archive/2008/08/22/how-to-build-rest-apps-on-net-using-wcf.aspx) ‚Äì way to much REST in my life these days
*   C++0x: Interview with Bjarne [Stroustrup](http://www.devx.com/SpecialReports/Article/38813/0/page/1)
*   With Amazon continuing to add to the [cloud](http://insidehpc.com/2008/08/21/amazon-adds-persistent-storage-to-ec2/), one has to ask if Oslo will provide the Microsoft Cloud?
*   [NVISION 2008](http://www.nvision2008.com/) has some impressive [video‚Äôs](http://www.nvision2008.com/Enthusiasts/nvscene_demoscene.cfm). CPU‚Äôs continue to play to [‚Äúfinancial market analyses‚Äù](http://www.nvision2008.com/Professionals/emerging-companies-summit.cfm)
*   Are [Panamaps](http://panamap.com/) (A [Multi-Layered Map](http://radar.oreilly.com/2008/08/urban-mapping-panamaps.html)) useful in finance?
*   [Moth](http://www.danielmoth.com/Blog/2008/08/make-object-id.html) on [Make Object ID](http://blogs.msdn.com/jimgries/archive/2005/11/16/493431.aspx)
*   As blogged elsewhere, [Photosynth](http://blogs.msdn.com/prophoto/archive/2008/08/20/photosynth-for-the-world.aspx) is [Released](http://blogs.msdn.com/virtualearth/archive/2008/08/20/photosynth-released-now-let-s-mash-it-with-virtual-earth.aspx).
*   Kind of cool to see that [Linden](http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2008/Aug-20-2.html) is rolling out [Mono](http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Mono) servers
*   Google [mojo?](http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&articleId=324097)
