- en: Assuming the trigger for a bear market is a recession, one way to guesstimate
    downside risk is to examine how the historical record of stock prices behaved
    in past recessions. Beginning in 1981-82, that bear market was particularly nasty
    because it lasted over a year, and it was triggered by the Volcker tight money
    era. The 1990 bear market and recession, which was ostensibly triggered by the
    Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, was mild. The Tech Wreck in the aftermath of the NASDAQ
    Bubble in 2001-02 was also painful, but was preceded by an unprecedented surge
    in stock prices. The bear market of 2008 was short and sharp, but stock prices
    fell roughly 50%. In conclusion, the historical record indicates that downside
    risk is in the 20-50% range.
