- en: Assuming the trigger for a bear market is a recession, one way to guesstimate
    downside risk is to examine how the historical record of stock prices behaved
    in past recessions. Beginning in 1981-82, that bear market was particularly nasty
    because it lasted over a year, and it was triggered by the Volcker tight money
    era. The 1990 bear market and recession, which was ostensibly triggered by the
    Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, was mild. The Tech Wreck in the aftermath of the NASDAQ
    Bubble in 2001-02 was also painful, but was preceded by an unprecedented surge
    in stock prices. The bear market of 2008 was short and sharp, but stock prices
    fell roughly 50%. In conclusion, the historical record indicates that downside
    risk is in the 20-50% range.

  zh: 假设熊市的触发因素是经济衰退，估算下行风险的一种方法就是研究历史上股票价格在过去经济衰退中的表现记录。从1981-82年开始，那次熊市特别糟糕，因为它持续了一年多，并且是由沃尔克紧缩货币时代引发的。1990年的熊市和衰退，表面上是由伊拉克入侵科威特引发的，但实际上较为温和。2001-02年科技股崩盘后，虽然痛苦，但之前股票价格出现了前所未有的飙升。2008年的熊市短而猛烈，但股价下跌了大约50%。总的来说，历史记录显示下行风险在20-50%的范围内。
