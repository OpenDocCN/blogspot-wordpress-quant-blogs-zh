- en: It's Monday morning and the futures are up over 3.0% due to the FNM/FRE bailout
    news. Since 1998 there have been 16 times when the S&P 500 has gapped up 2.0%
    or more. Eight of those times it closed higher than the open, and eight it closed
    lower.

    and 6 did not.

- en: 12 of the 16 broke below the lows of the 1st half hour of trading at some point
    during the day. Shorting that break and holding until the end of the day would
    have resulted in 6 winning trades and 6 losing trades.

- en: 5 of them broke the lows of the 1st half hour after 10:30am. Of those, 4 went
    on to close even lower on the day. The lone instance that rebounded closed almost
    3% higher, though.

    an intraday basis. I will update further if I do.
