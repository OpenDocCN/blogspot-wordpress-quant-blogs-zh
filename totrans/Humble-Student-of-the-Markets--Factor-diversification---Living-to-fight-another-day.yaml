- en: In the past I have met a number of quants who have forgotten the value of diversification.
    This attitude is especially prevalent among those who work at funds that happen
    to be showing superior returns at the time. The blowup at [Ospraie](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=ac8G.pB.5TCI&refer=home)
    illustrates the importance of factor diversification in model building (not to
    mention risk control and position sizing).

    the components of a long-only timing model as applied to a commodity equity index.
    The black line shows the cumulative returns of the index from 1995.

- en: '**Value works - but not all the time** The blue line shows the returns of a
    timing model based mainly on value principles. The underlying model is not a classic
    value model but one modified by market signals. The problem with classic value
    is that it tends to be too early – early to buy and early to sell. One way of
    mitigating that problem is to combine it with some forward looking signal, e.g.
    estimate revision or relative strength, so that the model doesn’t buy just because
    it’s cheap, it buys when it’s cheap and fundamentals have stopped moving down.'

    index over the 1995-2008 period but with lower volatility. It avoid much of the
    negative returns in the 1997-99 period but lagged when the benchmark started to
    rise in 2004.

    uptrend in the benchmark. The red line shows the cumulative return of a momentum
    model as applied to the commodity equity index.

- en: The momentum model also avoided much of the drawdowns that the value avoided
    in 1997-99\. It was also above to participate in the rise in the index from 2003
    onwards. Overall, it outperformed the value model probably because the test period
    in question was mainly a bull market. However, returns were more volatile than
    the value model. Moreover, the momentum model suffered a drawdown in this current
    downturn whereas the value model was flat for this period.

    a relatively high correlation coefficient we can observe a diversification effect.
    The green line shows the cumulative returns of a modified value and momentum model,
    which outperforms the index and either the value or momentum model alone. Volatility
    is lower than the momentum model indicating superior risk-adjusted returns.

    and momentum models. What if an investor was short term oriented and allocated
    the weights according to recent performance? This could easily happen in a hedge
    fund with a value manager and momentum manager: “We manage risk and allocate capital
    according to the returns of our strategies”. The chart below shows the returns
    of a weighting scheme that adapts according to the recent returns of the two investment
    approaches. While adaptive weighting does outperform the benchmark, it does not
    outperform the fixed weighting scheme.'
