    then at MarketSci [here](http://marketsci.wordpress.com/2010/10/20/roundup-tactical-asset-allocation/)
    for a few examples. I have recently been playing around with the concept but with
    a very different approach. I figured it might be interesting for readers to hear
    another approach to a similar problem.

- en: 'Rotation systems are often based on two very simple concepts: momentum (relative
    strength) effect and negative correlation. The goal of such models is usually
    to allocate capital to securities trending on the upside. By selecting securities
    that are show negatively correlated behaviour we expect the securities to complement
    each other depending on the regime. For example one could include in the basket
    of available securities stocks and fixed incomes ETFs with the expectation to
    be long bond when stocks are not performing and vice-versa. This kind of model
    basically surfs the beta with the momentum of securities. This approach demands
    certain considerations when creating the model, and depending on the investor,
    various degrees of fancy maths are going to be used. When looking at creating
    such systems, we need to determine the following amongst others:'

    also could include ETFs with different degrees of leverage to aggressively add
    beta when the time is right. Then we can select them based on heuristic, macroeconomic
    relationship, data mining etc.

    difference between prices of different time frames or a rate-of-change indicator.
    The RSI , [DVO](http://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2009/07/29/the-dvo/) or [TSI](http://engineering-returns.com/tsi/)
    indicators are also good candidates. Alternatively you could fit a least square
    model and evaluate slope and residuals. You could also do some kind of factor
    decomposition and create a factor model to forecast momentum.'

    could be used or we could use volatility to adjust the weight amongst securities.
    Mean-variance optimization with certain tweaks to it would perhaps make a good
    candidate.'

- en: '**4\. How often do we recalibrate the strategy?** Most TAA systems recalibrate
    monthly and some rotation systems trade on a weekly time frame. The trick is to
    minimize the transaction cost while still capitalizing on the uptrend of selected
    securities and mitigating the drawdown. The appeal of such systems is usually
    their risk adjusted performance and we would not want to compromise it.'

- en: '**5\. Do we consider alternative/innovative metrics in the system?** Michael
    at Marketsci recently talked about taking correlation during market shocks into
    considerations. This type of innovative approach seemed to work quite well for
    him, and really here sky is the limit. We only have to balance complexity and
    quality.'

    different from anything discussed so far on the blogosphere (as far as I am aware).
    Instead of using historical relative strength we will see how we can use machine
    learning classification and select securities using the forecast. I will also
    try to incorporate new metrics to help with system performance.
