    sensitive to newsflow and rallied on stories that the French and Germans were
    putting together plans to recapitalize banks (finally!). Then on Friday, you had
    the rally in the morning to the better than expected Non-Farm Payroll release
    and the fade when Italy, Spain and a number of UK banks got downgraded.

    now due for a multi-week period of sideways consolidation. The problems in Europe
    haven't gone away, nor has the threat of an American recession, which appears
    to be inevitable. As we move through 3Q Earnings Season in the next few weeks,
    the markets likely to be range-bound and volatile - until the newsflow worsens,
    which I believe will occur in about one or two months.

    MINOR violations of established lows ESPECIALLY when followed by sharp reversals
    and the level of volume.  In each chart, following a sharp decline, ***we usually
    see a consolidation period lasting approximately two months at which time a minor
    break and recovery occurs*** (of course, sometimes a major break occurs such as
    in Nov 2008, but I’m talking about minor breaks followed by quick reversals). 
    Usually, a positive divergence also forms in the RSI and MACD indicators (which
    only means the trend is shallower).  ***At this point, we either see a rally or
    another leg down.***
