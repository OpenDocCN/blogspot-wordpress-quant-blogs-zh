    ranging from exploratory analysis to post-trade. One tool has become influential
    enough to warrant highlight, and will serve as the algorithmic [*lingua franca*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingua_franca)
    in subsequent Quantivity posts. In particular, the forthcoming extended series
    on [Market Regime Trading](https://quantivity.wordpress.com/2009/12/31/market-regime-trading-redux/).
    As a veteran hard-core coder, this is no small complement.

    its origin: a programming language for statistical computing and graphics, similar
    to [S-PLUS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-PLUS) or [SAS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAS_%28software%29).
    Over recent years, dedicated quant contributors have evolved R quietly beyond
    its statistical roots into a fledging *platform for quantitative finance analysis*.
    Given the historical fracture amongst commercial analytic tools, R holds the potential
    to become the algorithmic standard for quantitative finance.'

    computational aspects of algorithmic trading, including R (and is contributor
    for the [xts](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xts/index.html) package,
    as kindly noted in a previous comment).
