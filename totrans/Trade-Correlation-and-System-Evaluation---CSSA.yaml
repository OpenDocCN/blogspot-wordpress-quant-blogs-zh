    unpleasant side effect of making a clear conclusion obvious. In a perfect world,
    the observed trading strategy distribution would come from a normal distribution
    and the distribution shape and mean would never change. However, even in such
    a perfect world, we cannot accurately model and evaluate  such a system if the
    trade distribution is not independent. A normal distribution makes this very assumption–that
    if one win’s on a recent trade, there is no linkage to the probability that one
    will win on a subsequent trade.  This makes everything like a roulette wheel where
    we can try martingale strategies (doubling down on a given color after a loss)
    but will never change the odds of winning/losing but rather the shape of profits
    and losses.  Effectively we can create option-like payoffs by manipulating our
    bet size based on the previous profit or loss but will not accomplish the task
    of changing the expected value.

    generated liquidity, and the emotions of the masses. It is an environment that
    creates self-reinforcing feedback loops that can periodically generate substantial
    auto-correlation (read:trending) in returns. The tendency for mean-reversion or
    follow-through itself is a form of dependency that would not be expected if the
    series of daily returns were random. Stepping away from these obvious points,
    is that different trading strategies whether short-term or long-term, trending
    or mean-reversion, will have a tendency to have either a correlated or un-correlated
    trade series. Part of the correlation in this trade series is driven by the market
    macro and micro-structure, while some of the correlation is idiosyncratic. It
    is up to the trader to figure out which is which.

    is that it can cause you to systematically overstate or understate your analysis
    of the short-term performance of the system. Imagine for a second that I was short-sighted
    and looked at the past 5 trades of an indicator or system to determine its usefulness.
    I watch closely, and  4 out of 5 are winners– fantastic, sign me up! I look at
    the long-term performance of the system or indicator, and it has a very good track
    record—again this bodes very well right? Well, not if you are trading many short-term
    mean-reversion systems, in this case exceptional short-term performance is especially
    bad for the next trade. This is because the series of trades is often negatively
    correlated. This also has the side effect of distorting the ability to “turn-off”
    the equity curve of the system, because ultimately doing so requires a clear trend
    signal. We would have to strip the correlation effect out of the system in order
    to clean up the signals. Note that in some types of systems, the trade returns
    are positively correlated, and you have the reverse effect happening. Winners
    follow winners and losers follow losers. This type of system lends itself very
    well to using a traditional equity curve based system.

    what they first seem. In fact, you may look at a terrible and inconsistent strategy
    by conventional metrics such as the Sharpe Ratio, or Profit Factor and mistakenly
    conclude that it is worth discarding. To the extent that the trading system has
    a predictable cycle or a high correlation between trade batches, you may be able
    to devise an extremely profitable system just from trading the equity curve of
    this “crappy” system. Even stranger is that you can combine two “crappy” systems
    using various co-efficients to create a very good system without having to trade
    the equity curves. Anything is possible, after all any given stock or instrument
    is just an equity curve itself–all of our attempts to use indicators to trade
    a stock is a means of manipulating or taking a derivation of that equity curve.
    Taking the same derivative approach to systems has the exact same effect. What
    is key to being successful here is that there must be some form of correlation
    that produces a systematic effect–otherwise we will face the same situation as
    with the roulette wheel where we are feverishly executing money management strategies
    in the hopes of taking advantage of random effects.
