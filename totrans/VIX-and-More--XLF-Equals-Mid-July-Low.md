# VIX and More: XLF Equals Mid-July Low

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/10/xlf-teetering-above-mid-july-low.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/10/xlf-teetering-above-mid-july-low.html#0001-01-01)

The all-time low for [XLF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLF) was 16.61 back in July. XLF, the closely-watched financial ETF, just touced this low as I type this, following the report of a pending U.K. bank bailout/rescue plan.
