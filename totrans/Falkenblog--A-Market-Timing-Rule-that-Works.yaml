    with hindsight, but in real-time do not generate an ability to better one's equity
    returns over the business cycle. The best intuition for this bias is that if we
    take a set of data generated by a simple time series and plot the stock price
    vs. future return for that stock, there would be a strong negative correlation
    between price and future return for our sample, though in real time we know the
    mere stock price does not predict stock returns. This paradoxical result is why
    many are certain the markets are irrational or at least susceptible to myriad
    improvements via if-then logic, because they have never tried the rules they are
    certain exist (and why E-Trade and Ameritrade market as if giving rubes a lot
    of information about trends and ratios leads fairly straightforwardly to better
    returns--as opposed to merely more brokerage commissions).

    extremely weak for the geometric return. The simple implication is that you might
    be able increase your Sharpe by avoiding the really highly volatile times that
    offer no corresponding return premium. The key, as highlighted in Welch and Goyal,
    is whether this is one of those patterns that disappears in real time, in that
    'high' and 'low' in the above graph is only revealed after seeing what happens;
    a useful rule looks at 'point in time' data that is not forward-looking, and this
    is were most rules fail.

    0.25 to 0.43\. With 33% of the volatility removed, it is comparable to 'minimum
    variance portfolios'. That is, those approaches also can also reduce your volatility
    relative to passive strategies by 30-40%, without sacrificing total return (usually
    increasing it a couple percent). The max drawdown moves from 55% to 47%, which
    isn't a lot, but the timing strategy missed a comparable loss in 2009, so more
    importantly the frequency of these 50%ish drawdowns was cut from 2 to 1\.

    and so I compared it to a static 68%/32% equity/bond portfolio. Here one sees
    that as having really no change on the Sharpe, though it reduces the portfolio
    volatility by quite a bit.
