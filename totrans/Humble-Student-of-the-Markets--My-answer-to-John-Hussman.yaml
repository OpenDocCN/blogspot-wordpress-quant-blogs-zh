- en: If you watch the video, you will see that at the beginning, John Hussman states
    that he believes that much scarce savings has been squandered. Instead of directing
    savings towards productive innovation, e.g. robotics, etc., it has gone into financial
    manipulation (my words, not his) in trying to save the current system.

    growth. It only serves to drive down interest rates and lower the risk premium,
    which results in a speculative reach for yield.

- en: What can an investor do under these circumstances? That's where I differ from
    John Hussman. It appears that Hussman manages his fund primarily based on his
    10-year rate of return outlook expectation. If return expectations for all asset
    classes are low, it makes sense to focus on capital preservation and to go long
    opportunistically. It's a long-term investment viewpoint, much like the sort adopted
    by pension fund committees and fiduciaries that I used to speak to in my previous
    life as an institutional money manager. I understand that point of view completely.

    can trade the swings in this market - and there are plenty of swings. In effect,
    Hussman is saying that we are in a modern day depression - sort of a Japanese
    Lost Decades-like environment. The economies of the developed world is likely
    to go through cycles of upswings caused by fiscal and monetary stimulus and declines
    as the stimulus is withdrawn, largely scarce savings is not being directed at
    productive investments.

    my time horizon is measured in weeks and months. That's why, despite the poor
    long-term return expectations, I can be relatively sanguine on the outlook for
    the stock market. (More on that in a future post.)
