    for their work lending to 'underserved' urban and rural communities. Above is
    a picture of one of the founders, Milton Davis--along with some community organizers--having
    a street named after him.

    Reinvestment Act. Shorebank worked with Clinton in Arkansas, and in 1992 Clinton
    called Shorebank 'the most important bank in America'. They gave money to Obama's
    presidential campaign, and he mentioned them as an example of good lending on
    his trip to Kenya when he was a Senator. The Illinois Finance Authority chairman
    and the current ShoreBank CEO are childhood friends (btw, did you know bank regulators
    included state 'Finance Authorities' that presumably help the commonweal?).

    either--and many banks have suffered, including Shorebank, which now needs about
    $125MM to avoid an FDIC takeover. Who ya gonna call? The WSJ

- en: about the new financial regulation bill in congress, and how what was so unsettling
    was not anything in the bill, just that there was a lot of power being granted
    without much guidance, a legislative dream. Finance has always been heavily regulated,
    and so bank executives have always been heavily populated with lending naifs who
    merely knew how to do PR. In our brave new world where government can take away
    your license to do business at a whim, you need to pay into the favor bank on
    regular occasions.
