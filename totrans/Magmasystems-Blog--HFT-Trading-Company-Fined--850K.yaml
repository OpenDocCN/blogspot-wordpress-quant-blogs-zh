    related to High Frequency Trading. It seems that they lost control of their algos
    at various times over the past 2 years.'

- en: I was thinking about this article in relation to a friend of mine who was interviewing
    at various HFT firms over the past few months (no, it's not me, and yes, he found
    a great job). He was asked every single little question about C++ minutiae, questions
    about manhole covers, questions about networking trivia, and questions about the
    timing of instructions. Maybe valuable stuff for a HFT developer to know. But
    not once did these interviews concentrate on testing and quality assurance and
    development practices.

    As technology improves, and as it becomes easier to recognizes errant algos (probably,
    in part, to the same kind of monitoring that

    become necessary for HFT firms to come up with better simulation scenarios for
    their algo testing.

- en: It would be interesting to me if Infinium hired Nanex to do a post-mortem on
    these three situations so that Infinium can start fixing their algos. Maybe this
    could grow into a sideline business for a Nanex-like startup, where other HFT
    firms could outsource the post-mortem and QA work. At the very least, the exchanges
    would be able to outsource this kind of real-time surveillance work.
