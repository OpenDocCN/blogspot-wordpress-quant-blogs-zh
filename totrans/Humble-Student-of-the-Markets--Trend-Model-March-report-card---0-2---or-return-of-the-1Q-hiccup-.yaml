    47.9%; and the return from inception of September 30, 2013 was 33.6%. The 0.2%
    return followed a -4.0% drawdown in February, which is somewhat reminiscent of
    the hiccup seen in 1Q 2014.

    asset allocation, model which uses trend following techniques as applied to commodity
    and global stock market prices to generates a composite Risk-On/Risk-Off signal
    (risk-on, risk-off or neutral). I have begun updating readers on the Trend Model
    signals on a weekly basis and via Twitter @humblestudent as new developments occur.

    of the signal, which are indicated by the arrows, overlaid on top of a chart of
    the SP 500\. You can think of the blue up arrows, which occurred when the trend
    signal changed from negative to positive, as buy signals and the red down arrows,
    which occurred when the trend signal changed from positive to negative, as sell
    signals.

    interesting, there is no substitute for actual performance. As a proof of concept,
    I started to manage a small account that traded long, inverse and leveraged ETFs
    on the major US market averages and, on occasion, sector and industry ETFs. Trading
    decisions were based on Trend Model signals combined with some short-term sentiment
    indicators. The inception date of the account was September 30, 2013 and the chart
    below represents an interim report card of that account. (For more details on
    how the Trend Model or how the account is managed, see my post

    is intended to be an absolute return vehicle. While I do show the SPY total return,
    which includes re-invested dividends, for illustrative purposes, the SP 500 is
    not an appropriate benchmark for measuring the performance of this modeling technique.

    especially challenging for this kind of trading system. The Trend Model signals
    are primarily based on the application of trend following principles to global
    stock and commodity markets. Trend following systems simply do not perform well
    in either sideways markets that are subject to whipsaw, or markets that experience
    sharp reversals.

- en: As shown by the chart of the SPX below, the first quarter was marked by an up-and-down
    whipsaw market. As the chart below shows, the stock market was largely trend-less
    and moved up and down through the 50-day moving average, which is a proxy of the
    price trend, many times during this period. The account managed to achieve positive
    returns largely in January and March largely through the use of short-term sentiment
    trading models that are used to supplement the main Trend Model signals, but these
    short-term models were caught offside when the market briefly trended in February.

    be an acid test for this trend following strategy. Positive returns during these
    volatile periods will lean more on the short-term sentiment models that I use
    to better assist the main trend following model to calibrate both entry and exits
    as well as the magnitude of position commitment.
