- en: First, consider this chart of the VIX Index (top) and the SPX (bottom). The
    normal inverse relationship of these two indices appears to be broken. Stocks
    have been falling all of last week, so why is the VIX down on the week as well?
    Even if you were to ignore the lockstep downward movement of the VIX and SPX on
    Monday and Tuesday, the VIX was flat to slightly down from Tuesday's close to
    Friday (green line) while the stock market continued to fall for that period.

  zh: 首先，考虑VIX指数（顶部）和SPX（底部）的这张图表。这两个指数的正常反向关系似乎已经被打破。股票在上周一直在下跌，那么为什么VIX在本周也下跌了呢？即使你选择忽略VIX和SPX在周一和周二的同步下跌，VIX从周二收盘到周五（绿色线）也是基本持平到略微下跌，而在这段时间内股市继续下跌。

    The CBOE’s VIX index gets a lot of attention, but using absolute values of the
    VIX to trigger investments is almost certainly useless. On the other hand, volatility
    prices over different time frames, often called the term structure, does show

    number by a longer term number. If the ratio is below one the market is relatively
    calm, if above one the market is especially nervous. I’ve been using the [CBOE’s
    VIX](http://www.cboe.com/micro/VIX/vixintro.aspx) and [VXV](http://www.cboe.com/micro/Vxv/)
    indexes as a convenient way to implement this volatility metric.

- en: The same principles he uses can be applied to the stock market. In "normal"
    markets, short-term volatility (VIX) is slightly lower than longer dated volatility
    (e.g. three-month VXV). Harwood uses the VIX to VXV ratio as a way of measuring
    how much angst the market has about volatility. If one-month volatility (VIX) significantly
    rises above three-month volatility (VXV), then watch out below.

  zh: 他使用的相同原则可以应用于股市。在“正常”市场中，短期波动率（VIX）略低于长期波动率（例如三个月的VXV）。哈伍德使用VIX对VXV比率作为衡量市场对波动性焦虑程度的方式。如果一个月波动率（VIX）显著高于三个月波动率（VXV），那么就要小心了。
- en: He uses a threshold of 0.917 for the VIX to VXV as his trigger point. If the
    ratio is below that number, then he will hold high yield bonds, but he will exit
    his position if the ratio rises above the threshold.

- en: While the 0.917 threshold is a trigger that could be the result of data mining,
    I examined the history of ratio based on data I downloaded from CBOE and found
    the median ratio was 0.928\. The difference between Harwood's 0.917 and the median
    is, as they say, close enough for government work. As a test, I added a further
    refinement. I created a second "crash warning" trigger, based on the median plus
    two standard deviations, which came to about 1.10.

- en: The chart below shows the results of my backtest of a modified version of Harwood's
    model. First consider the lower panel showing the VIX to VXV ratio. I have defined
    a high-risk zone as ratio readings that are two standard deviations above the

    median ratio reading, which are shown as blue arrows in the upper panel of the

- en: As you can see, the model seems to have backtested reasonably well and will
    bear watching to see how it performs in real-time. Buy signals have been relatively
    good entry points and sell signals have been good exit points to go to cash. Moreover,
    the two "crash warnings" have been excellent signals to enter into short positions.
