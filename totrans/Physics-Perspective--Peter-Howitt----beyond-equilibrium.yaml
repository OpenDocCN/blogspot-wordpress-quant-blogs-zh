- en: Mostly on this blog I've been arguing that current economic theory suffers from
    an obsession with equilibrium concepts, especially in macroeconomics, or in models
    of financial markets. Most of the physical and natural world is out of equilibrium,
    driven by forces that are out of balance. Things never happen -- in the oceans
    or atmosphere, in ecosystems, in the Earth's crust, in the human body -- because
    of equilibrium balance. Change always comes because of disequilibrium imbalance.
    If you want to understand the dynamics of almost anything, you need to think outside
    of equilibrium.

  zh: 大多数时候，我在博客上争论，当前的经济理论受到对均衡概念的迷恋，尤其是在宏观经济学或金融市场模型中。物理和自然界的绝大部分是非平衡状态，由不平衡的力量驱动。事情永远不会因为在海洋或大气中、生态系统中、地壳中、人体中——因为平衡而发生。变化总是因为非平衡不平衡而到来。如果你想要理解几乎任何事物的动态，你需要思考非均衡。
- en: This is actually an obvious point, and in science outside of economics people
    generally don't even talk about disequilibrium, but about dynamics; it's the same
    thing. Equilibrium means no dynamics, rest, stasis. It can't teach you about how
    things change. But we do care very much about how things change in finance and
    economics, and so we need models exploring economic systems out of equilibrium.
    Which means models beyond current economics.

  zh: 这实际上是一个显而易见的问题，在经济学之外的科学领域，人们通常甚至不谈论非均衡，而是谈论动态；这是同样的东西。均衡意味着没有动态，静止。它不能教你关于事物如何变化。但我们确实非常关心金融和经济中事物如何变化，因此我们需要探索经济系统非均衡的模型。这意味着超越当前经济学的模型。
- en: The need for disequilibrium economics was actually well accepted back in the
    1930s and 40s by economists such as Irving Fisher in the US and Nicholas Kaldor
    in England. Then in the 1950s, with the Arrow-Debreu results, and later with the
    whole Rational Expectations hysteria, it seems to have been forgotten. It's curious
    I think that really good economists, clear thinking people who are trying to address
    real world issues, often have no choice but to try to understand episodes of dramatic
    change (bank runs, bubbles, liquidity crises, leverage cycles) by torturing equilibrium
    models into some form that reflects these things. The famous

- en: The most important task of monetary policy is surely to help avert the worst
    outcomes of macroeconomic instability – prolonged depression, financial panics
    and high inflations. And it is here that central banks are most in need of help
    from modern macroeconomic theory. Central bankers need to understand what are
    the limits to stability of a modern market economy, under what circumstances is
    the economy likely to spin out of control without active intervention on the part
    of the central bank, and what kinds of policies are most useful for restoring
    macroeconomic stability when financial markets are in disarray.

    To understand how and when a system might spin out of control we would need first
    to understand the mechanisms that normally keep it under control. Through what
    processes does a large complex market economy usually manage to coordinate the
    activities of millions of independent transactors, none of whom has more than
    a glimmering of how the overall system works, to such a degree that all but 5%
    or 6% of them find gainful unemployment, even though this typically requires that
    the services each transactor performs be compatible with the plans of thousands
    of others, and even though the system is constantly being disrupted by new technologies
    and new social arrangements? These are the sorts of questions that one needs to
    address to offer useful advice to policy makers dealing with systemic instability,
    because you cannot know what has gone wrong with a system if you do not know how
    it is supposed to work when things are going well.

  zh: 但是，现代宏观经济学理论在这里所能提供的帮助最少。要理解一个系统可能如何以及何时失控，我们首先需要理解通常维持其稳定的机制。一个大型复杂的市场经济是如何通常协调数百万独立交易者的活动，而这些交易者中对整个系统的工作原理仅有模糊的了解，以至于除了5%或6%的人外，所有人都找到了有益的就业，即使这通常需要每个交易者提供的服务与数千其他人的计划相兼容，即使系统不断被新技术和新社会安排所扰乱？要向处理系统不稳定的政策制定者提供有用的建议，就需要回答这类问题，因为你如果不了解系统在运行良好时应该如何工作，就无法知道系统出了什么问题。

    the hypothesis of rational expectations. It must be emphasized that rational expectations
    is not a property of individuals; it is a property of the system as a whole. A
    rational expectations equilibrium is a fixed point in which the outcomes that
    people are predicting coincide (in a distributional sense) with the outcomes that
    are being generated by the system when they are making these predictions. Even
    blind faith in individual rationality does not guarantee that the system as a
    whole will find this fixed point, and such faith certainly does not help us to
    understand what happens when the point is not found. We need to understand something
    about the systemic mechanisms that help to direct the economy towards a coordinated
    state and that under normal circumstances help to keep it in the neighborhood
    of such a state.

  zh: 现代宏观经济学理论通过接受理性预期假说来回避这些问题。必须强调的是，理性预期并不是个体的属性；它是整个系统的属性。理性预期均衡是一个固定点，即人们预测的结果（在分布意义上）与他们做出这些预测时系统产生的结果相一致。即使对个体理性的盲目信仰也不能保证整个系统找到这个固定点，这种信仰肯定无助于我们理解当找不到这个点时会发生什么。我们需要了解一些关于引导经济朝着协调状态发展的系统性机制，以及在正常情况下帮助保持在这样一个状态附近的机制。

    Honkapohja (2001) and others goes a long way towards understanding disequilibrium
    dynamics. But understanding how the system works goes well beyond this. For in
    order to achieve the kind of coordinated state that general equilibrium analysis
    presumes, someone has to find the right prices for the myriad of goods and services
    in the economy, and somehow buyers and sellers have to be matched in all these
    markets. More generally someone has to create, maintain and operate markets, holding
    buffer stocks of goods and money to accommodate other transactors’ wishes when
    supply and demand are not in balance, providing credit to deficit units with good
    investment prospects, especially those who are maintaining the markets that others
    depend on for their daily existence, and performing all the other tasks that are
    needed in order for the machinery of a modern economic system to function.

  zh: 当然，萨金特（1999）等人的宏观经济学学习文献，以及艾文斯和霍纳帕哈（2001）等人的研究，在理解非均衡动态方面取得了长足的进步。但理解这个系统如何运作远远超出了这个范畴。因为为了实现一般均衡分析所假定的那种协调状态，必须有人为经济中的无数商品和服务找到正确的价格，同时
    somehow 买家和卖家必须在所有这些市场中匹配。更一般地说，必须有人创造、维护和运营市场，持有商品和货币的缓冲库存以适应其他交易者的愿望，当供求不平衡时，为有良好投资前景的赤字单位提供信贷，尤其是那些维持着他人日常生活依赖的市场的人，并执行所有其他现代经济系统运行所需的任务。

    which instead focuses on the interaction between a small number of aggregate variables
    under the assumption that all markets clear somehow, that matching buyers and
    sellers is never a problem, that markets never disappear because of the failure
    of the firms that were maintaining them, and (until the recent reaction to the
    financial crisis) that intertemporal budget constraints are enforced costlessly.
    By focusing on equilibrium allocations, whether under rational or some other form
    of expectations, DSGE models ignore the possibility that the economy can somehow
    spin out of control. In particular, they ignore the unstable dynamics of leverage
    and deleverage that have devastated so many economies in recent years.

    a new ‘‘neoclassical synthesis,’’ based on what Clower and I (1998) once called
    the ‘‘classical stability hypothesis.’’ It is a faith-based system in which a
    mysterious unspecified and unquestioned mechanism guides the economy without fail
    to an equilibrium at all points in time no matter what happens. Is there any wonder
    that such a system is incapable of guiding policy when the actual mechanisms of
    the economy cease to function properly as credit markets did in 2007 and 2008?
