- en: After a year or so of almost uninterrupted falling volatility, the last few
    weeks have seen a surge in the VIX and other measures of volatility. In fact the
    VIX more than tripled in a little over a month, jumping from an April 12 low of
    15.23 to a May 21 high of 48.20.

- en: One way to come to terms with the current 40ish level in the VIX is to think
    in terms of daily percentage changes in the underlying, the S&P 500 index. Technically,
    the VIX represents one standard deviation of the market’s estimation of changes
    in the price of the SPX during the next 30 days. The VIX number is the size of
    that standard deviation in annual percentage terms, but since volatility is a
    function of the square root of time, in order to translate that annual standard
    deviation number into a daily number, one has to divide by the square root of
    the number of trading days in a year. A year typically has about 252 trading days
    and the square root of 252 is 15.87, which options traders generally round up
    to 16 in their head. Hence the “[Rule of 16](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/rule%20of%2016).”

- en: Using 16 makes it easy to do some quick math in one’s head. If the VIX is at
    16, as it was a little over a month ago, one would expect that 68.2% of the time
    (one standard deviation), the daily change in the SPX would be 1% or less and
    31.8% of the time it would be 1% or more. To simplify the math even more, options
    traders often make the mental conversion of 68.2% to two thirds. Since traders
    are generally more concerned about big moves than small ones, they tend to focus
    on the outlier portion of the standard deviation calculation, the one third of
    trading days which are more volatile than normal.

    around 40, options traders are expecting that the SPX will have daily change of
    2.5% about 1/3 of the time.

- en: Looking backward, as volatile as the market have been recently, only three days
    out of the past month have resulted in daily changes of 2.5% or more. In fact,
    for all of 2010, there have been only four days in which the SPX has been either
    up or down at least 2.5%.

- en: In terms of conclusions, either market volatility is about to increase substantially
    from current levels or options traders have overestimated future volatility. As
    bearish as today has been, the SPX is “only” down 1.6% as I type this. If we have
    one or two more days in which stocks show average to slightly higher than usual
    volatility, expect the VIX to begin to move back down to a level that is a better
    reflection of those daily moves.
