    but head and shoulders patterns are incomplete until the neckline breaks. The
    market staged a marginal upside breakout through resistance on Thursday. The measured
    objective of the inverse H&S breakout is about 4920, but that level may be overly
    ambitious. If the Santa rally has truly begun, one of the tactical indicators
    that he has returned to the North Pole is whether the VIX Index falls below its
    lower Bollinger Band, which is an overbought signal to take trading profits.
