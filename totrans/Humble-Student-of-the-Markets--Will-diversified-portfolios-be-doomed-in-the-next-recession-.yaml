    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    signal. A bullish Trend Model signal that gets less bullish is a trading "sell"
    signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading
    "buy" signal. The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of
    the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. The turnover rate
    of the trading model is high, and it has varied between 150% to 200% per month.

    returns and cushion equity downside risk in the next bear market? In the last
    crisis, fixed income investments proved to be a poor diversifier as credit spreads
    blew out, and only Treasuries rallied. In the next bear market, will Treasuries
    be able to fulfill their role as diversifying investments?

    safe haven asset of choice during periods of economic stress. If the USD and USTs
    lose their safe status, what happens to diversified portfolio returns? Will the
    decline in their asset values accelerate because bonds, and especially USTs, fall
    in value along with the price of other risky assets like stocks?
