- en: My answers consist of several parts. First, don’t confuse the secular effect
    with the cyclical effect. With airlines from Aloha to Frontier going into Chapter
    11, a possible Delta-Northwest merger in the works and the US economy in recession,
    there should be a surplus of pilots in the short term – that’s the cyclical effect.
    The longer term secular effect is found at the age demographics of most flying
    clubs that I have visited – there are few members in their 20s and 30s. Members
    below the age of 50 seem to be the “young pups”.

    of a pilot. Under this scheme, it is possible to qualify as a member of a cockpit

    a case of the blind leading the blind.

    flying. There are many pilots who would still say that they have the greatest
    job in the world despite the mediocre pay scales, long hours away from home, etc.
    If you are willing to accept those conditions in exchange for the experience of
    flying for a living, who do you have to blame for that?
