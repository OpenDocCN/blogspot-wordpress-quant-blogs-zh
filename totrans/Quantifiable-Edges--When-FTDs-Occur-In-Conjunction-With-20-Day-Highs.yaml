- en: I discussed the other day that there has never been a Follow Through Day (FTD)
    that occurred AFTER a new 50-day high. There has also never been a FTD that occurred
    in conjunction with a new 50-day high. These things changed on Tuesday since the
    move up was also accompanied by an increase in volume. But there have been some
    FTDs that occurred in conjunction with 20-day highs. Below is a new study that
    shows how they fared.

    a better feel for the short-term returns I have listed the instances below.

- en: The run-up to drawdown ratio here is quite impressive. I’ll also note that 7
    of the 10 instances went on to have “successful” rallies. (“Success” means it
    either hit a new 200-day high or at least rose 2x as much as it had already risen
    off the bottom.) The 3 instances whose rallies did not succeed (circled in red)
    all saw run-ups of at least 2% before they eventually rolled over and made new
    lows.
