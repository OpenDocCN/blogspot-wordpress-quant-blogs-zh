    thoughts and ideas to others in the hopes that we all might be able to benefit
    somewhat from sharing observations. I'll start by describing an edge using

    it was almost simultaneously revealed across several sources? This seemed to be
    the case with an edge I had discovered some time back via data mining. I first
    noticed it was divulged in a recent copy of Active Trader, '

    to use it here. IBS stands for Internal Bar Strength (not to be confused with
    the IBS that many traders might have developed over the years). The strength indicator
    is described with an extremely simple equation:'

    low to high range of the period. When Jaffray Woodriff was interviewed in the
    latest Hedge Funds Wizards book, he described a very simple predictive indicator
    (based only upon transformations of the Open, High, Low, and Close of the data)
    that had proved remarkably stable over the years. It inspired some

    of a holy grail. If there was ever a hypothesis model that came close to his description,
    I'd certainly consider this as a candidate for the reversion side. In addition
    to simplicity, one of the reasons it is so useful is that unlike many other approaches
    at feature transformation of raw financial series, it is scale invariant and does
    not require any further scaling to support non-stationary data. The results of
    the transformation will always be bound between 0 and 100%. So the transformed
    features will always be bound inside of a fixed and finite space regardless of
    the evolving data properties (a great property for machine learning). The algorithm
    runs very fast and does not require frequent readjusting of model parameters unlike
    many online or econometric based models.

- en: The system simply buys at the close when the IBS indicator closes near the low
    end of the day and goes short when the indicator closes near the high of the day;
    exit is next day close.  Much of the time the indicator is neutral or no trade,
    allowing a good net risk adjusted return with low exposure. The thresholds, while
    often mentioned as being set to the 0.25 and 0.75 quartiles of the range, can
    be adjusted or found manually in the optimization settings.

- en: In order to avoid hindsight bias and over-fitting error (as in Fig 1.), I show
    an optimization using only in sample data for SPY (yahoo data) up to the year
    2000 (rank sorted by CAGR and Sharpe). One interesting thing we notice is that
    the higher threshold is actually optimized to 1, meaning no reversion from the
    high/short side. This is consistent with what we would expect with a long bias/drift
    market. We always have to be careful about systematic shorting with a market that
    has long term positive drift.

    well for the rest of the out of sample data (Fig 3.).   A last comment is that
    looking at the over-fit data should gives us some insight about reversion systems
    and high volatility sell off regimes.
