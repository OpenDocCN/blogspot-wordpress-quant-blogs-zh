    strategies and the CBOE PutWrite Index ([PUT](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/PUT)),
    I have spent some additional time with the PUT data to see what sort of secrets
    I might be able to uncover.

- en: I must confess that the more I dig, the more I am intrigued by this index put-write
    approach. Since there has been considerable discussion about the differences in
    return between the PUT and the closely related CBOE BuyWrite ([BXM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/BXM))
    Index, I will start by showing a table that has a year-by-year comparison of the
    PUT and the BXM. Just for fun I threw in the average VIX for each year, the change
    in the average VIX from year to year, the VIX range for the year and a ratio of
    that range divided by the average VIX. While none of these additional data points
    provides a smoking gun, each offers up a piece of the overall performance puzzle.

- en: The second graphic is a simple matrix of monthly returns for the PUT since 1986\.
    Not surprisingly, the two worst monthly returns were during the volatility peaks
    in October [1987](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/1987) and October
    2008\. In a related note, several of the most profitable months for the PUT came
    just after high volatility events.

- en: For those looking to dig deeper into this issue, consider that put-write absolute
    and relative returns are largely a function of implied volatility, the trending
    characteristics of the SPX and interest rates. Note also that that upper chart
    only goes back to June 1^(st), 1988 because that is when Standard & Poor’s began
    reporting daily dividends for the S&P 500 Total Return Index.
