    economies are going to behave? We do – it’s called demographics. While this time
    machine won’t tell you the winner of the Super Bowl in 2015, it will tell us a
    lot about the probable behavior of world economies, consumer behavior and investment
    and saving preferences.

    oldest. It had a baby boom whose demographic peak preceded the US one by about
    ten years. The US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand had a post WW-II baby boom
    all about the same time. The EU also had one, albeit with lower intensity, that
    lagged the US boom by about ten years.

    Chinese government can restrain growth in expenditures, and if Chinese technology
    and education levels ultimately catch up with those of the West and Japan, the
    model’s long run looks much brighter. China eventually becomes the world’s saver
    and, thereby, the developed world’s savoir [sic] with respect to its long-run
    supply of capital and long-run general equilibrium prospects. And, rather than
    seeing the real wage per unit of human capital fall, the West and Japan see it
    rise by one fifth percent by 2030 and by three fifths by 2100\. These wage increases
    are over and above those associated with technical progress, which we model as
    increasing the human capital endowments of successive cohorts.

    are quite troubling. Even under the most favorable macroeconomic scenario, tax
    rates will rise dramatically over time in the developed world to pay baby boomers
    their government-promised pension and health benefits. As Argentina has so recently
    shown, countries can grow quite well for years even with unsustainable fiscal
    policies. But if they wait too long to address those policies, the financial markets
    will do it for them, with often quite ruinous consequences.
