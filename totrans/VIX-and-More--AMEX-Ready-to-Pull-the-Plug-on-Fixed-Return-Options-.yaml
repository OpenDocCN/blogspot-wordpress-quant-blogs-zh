    Freifeld concludes that the absence of new expirations months and strikes suggests
    the AMEX is likely to phase out FROs soon.'

    by the lack of availability via brokers and particularly the large bid/ask spreads.
    These two issues may be a function of marketing, nomenclature, a single exchange
    approach or other factors, but ultimately if the spreads are too large, then it
    becomes extremely difficult to implement a strategy which can overcome such large
    transaction costs over the long term.

    products. The CBOE uses the term “[binary options](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/binary%20options)”
    for similar options they offer on the SPY and VIX. While SPY binary options are
    generating some interest, at the money spreads are still in the 0.06 – 0.08 range,
    which is discouraging a more active market.

    post of two months ago, VIX binaries continue to suffer from a lack of interest.
    This is unfortunate, because in many respects VIX binary options are in much easier
    to understand and potentially to trade successfully than standard VIX options.

    launched futures on the [VDAX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VDAX)
    known as the VOLAX back in 1998\. While that product launch was not successful,
    it did pave the way for a successful launch of [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures)
    six years later.
