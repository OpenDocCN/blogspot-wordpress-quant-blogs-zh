    a key criteria of the Phoenix screen. Consider the members of S&P/TSX Composite
    Index, 29.8% of its members are priced below $10 a share, compared to 10.6% for
    the S&P 500\. Even if we lowered the cutoff to $5, 8.7% of the S&P/TSX Composite
    trade below $5, compared to 3.2% for the S&P 500.
