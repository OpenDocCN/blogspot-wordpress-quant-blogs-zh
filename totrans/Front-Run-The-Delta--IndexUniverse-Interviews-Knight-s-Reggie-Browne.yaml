    rest at the [arbitrage band](http://frontrunthedelta.blogspot.com/2011/08/etf-futures-arbitrage-fxe-and-eur.html).
    Wherever the arbitrage is located, market makers will begin quoting at [that band](http://frontrunthedelta.blogspot.com/2011/10/etf-futures-arbitrage-slv-against-cmes.html).
    And the further you go through this band, the more liquidity shows up. That’s
    fundamental. There’s no disagreement about that.**'
