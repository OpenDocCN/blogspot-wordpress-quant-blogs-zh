# Humble Student of the Markets: Risk happens quickly

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2021/01/risk-happens-quickly.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2021/01/risk-happens-quickly.html#0001-01-01)

**Mid-week market update**

: What are we make of this market? In the last four years, the weekly S&P 500 chart shows that we have seen six corrective episodes of differing magnitudes. Risk happens, and sometimes with little or no warning.

About half of those instances saw negative 5-week RSI divergences, which we are seeing today. Since the start of 2019, when the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) started to get hot, the ARKK to SPY ratio roll over every time during those corrections. That ratio is turning down again.

Will this time be any different? The S&P 500 hasn't seen a downside break of the rising trend line on the weekly chart yet.
