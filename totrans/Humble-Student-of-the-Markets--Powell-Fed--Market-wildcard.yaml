    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time

    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    of the trading model is high, and it has varied between 150% to 200% per month.

    the 10-year Treasury yield approached the 3% mark, which was the "line in the
    sand" drawn by a number of analysts that indicated trouble for equity prices.
    As the following chart shows, the 10-year yield had violated a trend line that
    stretched back from 1990\. One puzzle is the mixed message shown by the yield
    curve. Historically, both the 2-10 yield curve, which represents the spread between
    the 10 and 2 year Treasury yields, and the 10-30 yield curve both inverted at
    the same time on the last three occasions to warn of looming recessions. This
    time, the 2-10 yield curve has been volatile and steepened recently, which the
    10-30 yield curve stayed on its flattening trend.

  zh: 债券市场是在告诉我们一切都将结束吗？当10年期国债收益率接近3%的大关时，股票价格受到了惊吓。许多分析师划定的这一“底线”预示着股市的麻烦。如图所示，10年期的收益率已经违反了自1990年以来回溯的趋势线。一个谜题是收益率曲线所显示的混合信号。历史上，在最后一次预警即将到来的衰退时，2-10国债收益率曲线（代表10年和2年国债收益率之间的利差）和10-30国债收益率曲线同时倒置。这次，2-10国债收益率曲线近期波动较大且趋陡，而10-30国债收益率曲线则保持其平坦化趋势。

    Fed? The risks of a policy mistake are high during the current late cycle expansion
    phase of the economy. Adhere to overly strict rules-based models of monetary policy,
    and the Fed risks tightening too much or too quickly and send the economy into
    a tailspin. Allow the economy to run a little hot with based on the belief of
    a symmetrical 2% inflation target, inflation could get out of hand. The Fed would
    consequently have to step in with a series of staccato rate hikes that guarantee
    a recession.

  zh: 鲍威尔美联储对通胀的反应函数与耶伦美联储有何不同？在经济当前的后期周期扩张阶段，政策失误的风险很高。坚持过于严格基于规则的货币政策模型，美联储可能会过度或过快地收紧，并使经济陷入螺旋式下降。基于对称的2%通胀目标的信念，让经济稍微过热一点，通胀可能会失控。美联储随后可能不得不介入，通过一系列断断续续的加息来确保经济衰退。
