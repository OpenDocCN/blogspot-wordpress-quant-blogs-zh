    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    signal. A bullish Trend Model signal that gets less bullish is a trading "sell"
    signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading
    "buy" signal. The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of
    the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. The turnover rate
    of the trading model is high, and it has varied between 150% to 200% per month.

    the 10-year Treasury yield approached the 3% mark, which was the "line in the
    sand" drawn by a number of analysts that indicated trouble for equity prices.
    As the following chart shows, the 10-year yield had violated a trend line that
    stretched back from 1990\. One puzzle is the mixed message shown by the yield
    curve. Historically, both the 2-10 yield curve, which represents the spread between
    the 10 and 2 year Treasury yields, and the 10-30 yield curve both inverted at
    the same time on the last three occasions to warn of looming recessions. This
    time, the 2-10 yield curve has been volatile and steepened recently, which the
    10-30 yield curve stayed on its flattening trend.

- en: How will the Powell Fed's reaction function to inflation differ from the Yellen
    Fed? The risks of a policy mistake are high during the current late cycle expansion
    phase of the economy. Adhere to overly strict rules-based models of monetary policy,
    and the Fed risks tightening too much or too quickly and send the economy into
    a tailspin. Allow the economy to run a little hot with based on the belief of
    a symmetrical 2% inflation target, inflation could get out of hand. The Fed would
    consequently have to step in with a series of staccato rate hikes that guarantee
    a recession.
