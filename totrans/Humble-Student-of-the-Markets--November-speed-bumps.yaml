    market action on Friday was somewhat disappointing for the bulls, as the minor
    beat on the NFP failed to fully energize stocks for the day. I am becoming more
    wary of the outlook for stocks as we head into November as there are a couple
    of important hidden speed bumps for the bulls.

    hasn't considered the possibility that the Republican Party could turn on itself.
    The GOP has been divided between two wings, the Establishment wing, as exemplified
    by the likes of George H. W. Bush, the classic East Coast Establishment patrician,
    and the social conservatives, as exemplified by Sarah Palin and the Tea Party.

    The social conservatives lost the nomination, but closed ranks with other Republicans
    and for the sake of the Party. The implicit message was, "You get your chance
    to make your mark this time."

    point fingers and try to blame the Establishment wing for the loss and split the
    GOP? If that happens, the Tea Party and their social conservative allies would
    make an ideological stand in order to differentiate themselves from the Establishment
    Republicans and send the country over the fiscal cliff like an innocent bystander.

    growth picked up in the years following the Party Congresses. Because of the pick-up
    of investments, some believe that the same will happen again next year.
