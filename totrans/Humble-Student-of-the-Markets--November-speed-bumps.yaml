    market action on Friday was somewhat disappointing for the bulls, as the minor

    of important hidden speed bumps for the bulls.

    The GOP has been divided between two wings, the Establishment wing, as exemplified

    and the social conservatives, as exemplified by Sarah Palin and the Tea Party.
