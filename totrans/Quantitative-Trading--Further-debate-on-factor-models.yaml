    this weekend I was actually also thinking about the philosophy behind factor models
    which you allude to in the post. I am wondering if you have any other thoughts
    as to what service factor models provide? Relegating them to ''just arrogant bets
    on the correctness of the managers'' convictions'' isn’t completely intellectually
    satisfying to me.'

    can come either because the market is inefficient and systematically misprices
    those factors (alpha), and/or because I am providing some service via the exposure
    (and collecting some kind of risk premium associated with that service). My question
    #1 to you is, are you convinced that all of the returns to factor models are indeed
    simply from risk premiums and not alpha? If alpha exists, it’s less clear that
    a service needs to be provided to the market, at least to me.'

    market is efficient. Then, you will be compensated for factor exposure only by
    bearing some risk or providing some service. In my mind, some particular conviction
    of a manager doesn’t necessarily qualify for a risk factor in and of itself -
    I think we agree on that point. But are there possible fundamental, valuation-based
    explanations behind these factors? Perhaps low VALUE companies are generally those
    companies with bad recent performance but which are expected to turnaround / mean-revert
    (as you somewhat suggest in your post) and the risk you bear when buying a low
    P/E company is “turnaround risk”. Or perhaps high MOMENTUM companies are companies
    riding an industry trend and you are bearing “trend continuation risk”. So, my
    question #2 to you is, are you convinced that there are no such explanations?'

    risks behind the factors, or alpha, or both."

- en: '"I believe the service that some value factors provide is the efficient allocation
    of capital to those companies that deserve them, just like any value investors
    do. In this case, the factors hope to identify these companies faster than humans
    can, and therefore bring capital to them sooner. I have no argument with these
    factors as they also provide liquidity, albeit on a longer time-scale. However,
    with regard to various momentum factors, they are in fact just betting on certain
    behavioral characteristics of investors, or on the slow dissemination of news,
    etc. You can argue that they provide a service by improving the efficiency with
    which information about companies disseminate. But the problem is that once everybody
    are using these momentum factors, the market becomes efficient and any further
    bets generate losses.'

    alpha, but these factors are generating more losses as more investors employ them.
    I am also willing to accept that many of the (value) factors represent risk premia.
    As more investors employ these, the profit goes to zero, but fortunately not negative
    as the risk also disappears."
