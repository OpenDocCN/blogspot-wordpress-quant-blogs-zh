# Use-Case Points (UCP) | Tales from a Trading Desk

## Use-Case Points (UCP)

McLinsey appears to be making some [noise](http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/business_technology/enhancing_the_efficiency_and_effectiveness_of_application_development) about UCP’s.  UCP’s are not new, dating [back](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_Case_Points) to 1993.  There are a few paper [available](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/edge/09/mar09/collaris_dekker/) on web around UCP usage – one dating from [2001](http://www2.fiit.stuba.sk/~bielik/courses/msi-slov/reporty/use_case_points.pdf). My issue with UCP is around the non-agileness:

> In general, UCPs are applicable to waterfalldevelopment and can be used by teams following agilemethodologies as long as the agile teams use UCs to gather requirements.

Mike Cohn also offers a [view](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jhm/Readings/Cohn%20-%20Estimating%20with%20Use%20Case%20Points_v2%2012-24-50-761.pdf) on UCP.  Thus it appears to me that if McLinsey are pushing UCP, they must be following waterfall, and not on an agile road.
