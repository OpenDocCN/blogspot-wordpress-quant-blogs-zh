    marks the tenth time I have had the opportunity to write a column for Barron’s
    and this time around I even managed to suppress the impulse to write about the
    VIX and volatility – at least directly.

    I drill down on an element of [hedging](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/hedging)
    I cited in one of my [hall of fame](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/hall%20of%20fame)
    posts, [Cheating with Partial Hedges](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2012/05/cheating-with-partial-hedges.html).
    Specifically, I talk about [bear put spreads](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/bear%20put%20spread),
    which I like to think of as “gap hedges” due to the fact that they offer protection
    should the underlying fall in between two strikes.

- en: 'The Barron’s article talks about a specific SPY gap hedge strategy involving
    buying puts that are 5% out-of-the-money and offsetting some of the cost of the
    put protection (and capping the downside effectiveness) by selling puts that are
    10% out-of-the-money. Done at a 1x1 ratio, this is a classic bear put spread that
    has the following effect on an SPY position:'

    of converting the 1x1 position into a [ratio put spread](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/ratio%20put%20spread)
    by selling *two* 10% OTM puts for every one 5% OTM put that is purchased. With
    SPY closing at 154.14 today, the strike closest to a 5% pullback is 146, where
    the July puts currently at 2.55\. At the same time, the 10% OTM strike is 139
    and the July 139 puts are 1.40\. With these numbers, a 1x2 ratio spread can be
    initiated for a credit of 0.25 (2x1.40 – 2.55) and provide protection down to
    SPY 139 (9.8% below today’s close) essentially for free. The big caveat here is
    that there is no such thing a free portfolio protection. What happens here is
    that in moving from a 1x1 put spread to a 1x2 ratio spread, the position is transformed
    from a limited risk position to a unlimited risk position where investors are
    exposed to the possibility of large losses should SPY fall below 139 prior to
    the July 20^(th) expiration. For this reason, put ratio spreads – or any options
    trade with unlimited risk – should be utilized only by advanced options traders.
    In contrast, the standard 1x1 put spread is an excellent trade for beginning and
    intermediate options traders to seek to master.
