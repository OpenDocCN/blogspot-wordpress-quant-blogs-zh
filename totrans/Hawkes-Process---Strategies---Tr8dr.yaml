    Hawkes process is a “point process” modeling event intensity incorporating empirical
    event occurrence.

- en: Intra-day Stochastic Volatility Prediction The recent theme in the literature
    has been to replace the quadratic-variance approach with a time-based approach.
    The degree of movement within an interval of time is equivalent in measure to
    the amount of time required for a given movement, and can be interchanged easily
    as Andersen, Dobrev, and Schaumburg have shown in “Duration-Based Volatility Estimation”.

- en: John Carlsson in “Modeling Stock Orders Using Hawkes’s Self-Exciting Process”,
    suggests a strategy where if the Hawkes predicted ratio of buy/sell intensity
    exceeds a threshold (say 5) buy (sell) and exit position within N seconds (he
    used 10).

- en: This plays on the significant autocorrelation (ie non-zero decay time) of the
    intensity back to the mean. A skewed ratio of buy vs sell orders will surely influence
    the market in the direction of order skew.

    etc. We can also look at the buy/sell intensity of highly correlated assets and
    use to enhance the signal.
