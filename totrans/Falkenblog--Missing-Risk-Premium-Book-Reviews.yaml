- en: Questioning the theory is a tough challenge, though. As already mentioned, the
    risk premium is a central premise, and modern finance theory is a ramified structure.
    If we remove that premise, there is a lot of work to be done to recreate the structure
    around an alternative. I was surprised to find that Falkenstein understands the
    burden his questioning entails, and this book is a partial attempt to flesh out
    an alternative. Falkenstein is a serious fellow, and he has engaged the problem
    persistently over many years, so it is interesting to listen to his suggestions.

    return over more than a half century, a careful exposition of what the data say
    and don’t say, and a thoughtful discussion of competing theoretical frameworks.
    He writes with the refreshing voice of an outsider, and looks upon academia with
    a gimlet eye. But he also writes with the qualifications of an insider, completely
    familiar with the most sophisticated economic theories and statistical tools.
    He assumes the burden of making his critique and ideas resonant to an open minded
    intellectual familiar with modern economics. Make no mistake, this is a wonkish
    book that places serious demands on its readers.

    the many small losses that individual investors suffer between the stock gains
    they see reported on CNBC, and the returns they get. Investors are constantly
    dinged by things like bad timing, transactional costs, bid-ask spreads and taxes.
    Once you throw in variables like survivorship bias, Falkenstein says that the
    historical databases we have return bare little resemblance to what made its way
    towards investors’ pockets. This topic alone could serve as a useful book.

- en: The book is mostly technical, but without unnecessary math, and is focused on
    the main thesis - there is no "investment edge" in simply taking the risk. I would
    recommend every investor keep this in mind.
