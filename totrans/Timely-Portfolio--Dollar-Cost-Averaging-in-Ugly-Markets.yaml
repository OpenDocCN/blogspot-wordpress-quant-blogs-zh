    allocation  after you hit the 60% drawdown level in September 1931?  These are
    your returns pursuing such a strategy.  Good to know assuming this is the absolute
    worst case  (can't think of much worse than the Great Depression with 89% ultimate
    drawdown) .  I like my chances.”

    of the dreadful market in 2008 and take definitive action to transform ugliness
    into opportunity.  So, knowing in 2008, that the bottom was unknowable, I thought
    I could test dollar cost averaging on the worst market in US history and see how
    it might work.  I picked without optimization 60% as the drawdown level to initiate
    a 10 month (makes the math easier) 10%/month allocation to the Dow Jones (1929-1931)
    and S&P500 (2007-2008).  The 60% drawdown level on monthly average basis hit September
    1931, so let’s see how it worked then.  Just knowing the worst case can help overcome
    the disabling fear.  A little tweaking would dramatically improve the performance,
    but I wanted to be intellectually honest and not optimize.

    the S&P 500 did not hit 60% drawdown in the 2008 crisis.  Just for fun, let’s
    tie this post and system concept to the caution of my [“Perils of Bottom Picking”
    post](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2011/01/perils-of-bottom-picking.html)
    by amending the drawdown to 55% and only investing when the index moves up on
    a monthly basis in tomorrow’s post (have not done, so will be a surprise to me
    too)…
