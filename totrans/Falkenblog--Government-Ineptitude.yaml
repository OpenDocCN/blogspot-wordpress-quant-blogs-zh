    away from a woman you were stalking and threatening to kill. Your counselor filed
    a restraining order against you, noting "a history dating to his graduate days
    of homicidal threats, actions, plans, threats & actions towards therapist." Have
    you thought about Anthrax development at our Army Medical Research Institute of
    Infectious Diseases? We're looking to people who think outside the box.
