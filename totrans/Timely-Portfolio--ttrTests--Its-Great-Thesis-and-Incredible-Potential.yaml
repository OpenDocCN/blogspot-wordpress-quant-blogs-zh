    I did not recognize its potential until I spent much more time absorbing the basis
    of the package—David St. John’s thesis [Technical Analysis Based on Moving Average
    Convergence and Divergence](http://math.uic.edu/~dstjohn/thesis.pdf).  Since the
    title specifically addresses MACD, which I have had little luck implementing,
    I dismissed much of the content.  However, the power of the thesis extends well
    beyond MACD to all systematic methods and describes tests to ensure luck is not
    the source of a system’s returns.  In the package documentation, there is a summary
    of the 5 main tests:'

    outperform a benchmark in the past data? Is the excess return significant, using
    bootstrapping to construct a confidence interval? Is the excess return explained
    by data snooping? Is the ’good’ choice of parameters robust across sub-samples?
    Is this robustness significant, using bootstrapping to construct a confidence
    interval?”'

    across both degrees of freedom and subperiods.  I look forward to documenting
    its power in my blog and also potentially working with the author to include in
    other R packages such as quantstrat.

    in the same style as the package documentation and the thesis paper, but this
    time on a xts DJI object gathered through getSymbols rather than the spData provided
    with the package.

    will help provide a flavor for the package and its powerful tests.  In my next
    couple of posts, I will run each test in much further detail on my basic custom
    CUD indicator and try to get the cumbersome output in a far more digestible and
    graphical format.
