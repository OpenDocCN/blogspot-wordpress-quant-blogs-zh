    Since then, equities have been flat. There is no doubt that correction is here.

    and the risk-on trade. Institutions are underweight and re-allocating funds into
    equities. Once the allocation begins, it's hard to stop. Individuals were underweight
    and are now roughly market weight as their fund flows are just getting started.

    the market corrected harder in March 2011 and fell through the 50-day moving average.
    (At the very least, these episodes show the value of the 50-day MA trailing stop
    as a risk control device.)

    and cyclically oriented TSX Composite in Canada. The market was in an uptrend
    and corrected in December 2010 and the uptrend was ultimately broken in March
    2011\. Today, the market remains in an uptrend that began in October 2011 and
    corrected but the current uptrend remains intact. During the QE2 rally, the market
    experienced a golden cross in September 2010\. Today, the market is about to see
    a golden cross, indicating that the rally is just getting started.

    the market tells the same story. Cyclicals remain in a relative uptrend today.
    During the QE2 rally, the December 2010 correction was just a hiccup in the relative
    uptrend, which ended in March 2011 when the uptrend was violated.

    December 2010\. Monetary conditions are similar. Uptrends are intact, as measured

    stochastic model. Here are a few observations. First, the fact that the Summation
    Index got to overbought levels suggested that the market was poised for a consolidation
    and corrective period. Now that we have entered that correction, which has been
    albeit mild, we need to see the stochastic move to oversold levels before calling
    the all-clear, just as we saw during the December 2010 episode.
