    and were willing to die for to protect in our Constitution. The rights that my
    son, as an infantryman in the United States army is willing to die for. The protections
    provided—thanks to you sir—we’re going to bestow them on a terrorist who hates
    our Constitution and wants to destroy our Constitution and our country? This makes
    no sense because we have a choice in how we’re going to deal with the terrorists.
