- en: Corey Rittenhouse got the chance to take the SuperCharged DV2 (SCDV2) for a
    test drive tonight.  Corey was skeptical that the SCDV2 would perform well during
    the rally, so I told him to test out the performance.  Most mean-reversion strategies
    have taken it on the chin lately, but the  SCDV2 is beating the S&P500 *even though
    it goes short readings above .5!*  Notable were 86% winners on the long side with
    an average gain per trade of over 1% since the rally began. It even won 57%  of
    trades on the short side during this moon shot run! Keep an eye out, as we have
    some fantastic trading systems coming out using the SCDV2 in tandem with other
    DV Indicators. [http://www.catallacticanalysis.com/strategytests/superchargedDV2preview.php](http://www.catallacticanalysis.com/strategytests/superchargedDV2preview.php)

    is **35%** over the last 12 years vs **28%** for the DV2, an incredible difference
    of **7%** every year with a lower max drawdown!*'
