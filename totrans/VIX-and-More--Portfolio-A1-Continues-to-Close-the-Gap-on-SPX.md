> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/09/portfolio-a1-continues-to-close-gap-on.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/09/portfolio-a1-continues-to-close-gap-on.html#0001-01-01)

From the department of small victories comes the news that for the third week in a row Portfolio A1 has taken a small bite out of the gaping performance hole between the portfolio and the benchmark S&P 500.  That performance gap, which peaked at 17.5% three weeks ago, has now been sliced to 9.9%.

[The Mosaic Company (MOS)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=mos&hl=en), a fertilizer producer, has been leading the charge back to respectability, with a 19.3% gain in three weeks.  New addition [DryShips (DRYS)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=drys&hl=en) was up 7.8% in its first week in the portfolio.

Two companies have been dropped from the list of holdings: [CNH Global (CNH)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=cnh&hl=en), despite a 10% return during its holding period; and [Western Refining (WNR)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=wnr&hl=en), which departs with a 7.3% aggregate loss.  These companies are replaced by two higher ranking stocks: [Sanderson Farms (SFM)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=safm&hl=en), a poultry producer; and [Navistar International (NAVZ)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=navz&hl=en), a returnee to the portfolio after a one month hiatus.  Navistar has been in the news lately for its [diesel-hybrid technology](http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/070820/20070820005873.html?.v=1) as well as its [armored vehicles](http://www.reuters.com/article/marketsNews/idUKN2246050320070822?rpc=44).

There are no other changes to the portfolio this week.
