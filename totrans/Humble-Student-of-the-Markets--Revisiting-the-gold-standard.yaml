    and gold. The most interesting thing to emerge out of this episode is that gold
    appears to have re-asserted itself as a reserve currency as its price climbed
    in USD terms.

    fiat money. In fact, it is a condemnation on single currency systems such as the
    gold standard. I have long argued that the mess the EMU created in 1999 with the
    inception of the Euro was unlikely to survive a serious global recession. This
    was due to one primary argument. The gold standard and single currency systems
    have all ended in demise for similar reasons. ***This was due to their inherent
    inflexibility and inherent weaknesses imposed on particular trade partners within
    the currency system.***

    stars that they didn't join the eurozone as they have the flexibility to devalue
    their currency if necessary.

    of value during periods of political chaos. Fortunately, most of us haven’t experienced
    that kind of chaos in our lifetimes, or our parents’ lifetimes, so we are only
    relying on the theory of gold as an ultimate store of value. Consider this discussion

    before it turned to "Gold", which he volunteered, he thought was dumb. Not that
    he thought the vaulting price was stupid. He offered no opinion of that. But,
    he said, the war years were tough. Really tough. (He was not of Serbian descent,
    as it would happen). He'd seen his friends, he explained, do the smash-n-grab
    (not literally) thing following the disintegration of what was Yugoslavia, rolling
    up ill-gotten gains into (amongst other material objects) hoards of gold. Their
    hedge. Their so-called mad money, for which he said chided them at the time, though
    to little effect. But, he went on, when things got really dire, there was no market
    for it. ***There was no way under the circumstances to reasonably convert the
    hoards to what one really needed. As a result, the going rate was all over the
    map, but half-ounce or ounces were commonly traded for sugar and flour in ratios
    that would make the wealth-hedging gold-bug weep***. I listened intently, though
    it was just an anecdote, but an interesting one nonetheless.

    anecdote, there is a point - call it the "Oh Fuck moment" beyond which Gold is
    quite sub-optimal, and sugar, petrol, some vegetable seeds, a goat or two, an
    alembic, all make seeming better sense. Or, perhaps in the extreme, the best hedge
    in the event (if you believe in the event) of a breakdown in the rule of law,
    is to BE the baddest thug, and/or join/align yourself with the meanest thugs around,
    a paradoxical feedback loop that leads one down a disturbing rathole indeed.
