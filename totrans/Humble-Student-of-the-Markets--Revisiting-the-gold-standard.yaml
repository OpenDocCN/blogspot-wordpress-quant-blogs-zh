- en: As the Greek crisis engulfed Europe, the euro fell against both the US Dollar
    and gold. The most interesting thing to emerge out of this episode is that gold
    appears to have re-asserted itself as a reserve currency as its price climbed
    in USD terms.

- en: The irony behind the Euro crisis is that it is not at all a condemnation of
    fiat money. In fact, it is a condemnation on single currency systems such as the
    gold standard. I have long argued that the mess the EMU created in 1999 with the
    inception of the Euro was unlikely to survive a serious global recession. This
    was due to one primary argument. The gold standard and single currency systems
    have all ended in demise for similar reasons. ***This was due to their inherent
    inflexibility and inherent weaknesses imposed on particular trade partners within
    the currency system.***

    of value during periods of political chaos. Fortunately, most of us haven’t experienced
    that kind of chaos in our lifetimes, or our parents’ lifetimes, so we are only
    relying on the theory of gold as an ultimate store of value. Consider this discussion

    before it turned to "Gold", which he volunteered, he thought was dumb. Not that
    he thought the vaulting price was stupid. He offered no opinion of that. But,
    he said, the war years were tough. Really tough. (He was not of Serbian descent,
    as it would happen). He'd seen his friends, he explained, do the smash-n-grab
    (not literally) thing following the disintegration of what was Yugoslavia, rolling
    up ill-gotten gains into (amongst other material objects) hoards of gold. Their
    hedge. Their so-called mad money, for which he said chided them at the time, though
    to little effect. But, he went on, when things got really dire, there was no market
    for it. ***There was no way under the circumstances to reasonably convert the
    hoards to what one really needed. As a result, the going rate was all over the
    map, but half-ounce or ounces were commonly traded for sugar and flour in ratios
    that would make the wealth-hedging gold-bug weep***. I listened intently, though
    it was just an anecdote, but an interesting one nonetheless.

    Yugoslavia 解体后，进行了破坏和抢夺（并非字面意思）的事情，把不正当的收益投入到（除了其他物质对象）黄金储备中。他们的避险。他们所谓的疯狂金钱，为此他当时责备了他们，尽管效果不大。但是，他继续说，当情况变得非常糟糕时，市场上没有黄金的需求。**在那种情况下，没有办法合理地将储备转换成真正需要的东西。结果，黄金的市价波动很大，但半盎司或盎司的黄金常用于交换糖和面粉，这种比例会让避险的黄金狂热者痛哭流涕**。我聚精会神地听着，虽然这只是个轶事，但同样有趣。

- en: Viewed from this point, gold is a trade, for ruminating upon my Bosnian acquaintance's
    anecdote, there is a point - call it the "Oh Fuck moment" beyond which Gold is
    quite sub-optimal, and sugar, petrol, some vegetable seeds, a goat or two, an
    alembic, all make seeming better sense. Or, perhaps in the extreme, the best hedge
    in the event (if you believe in the event) of a breakdown in the rule of law,
    is to BE the baddest thug, and/or join/align yourself with the meanest thugs around,
    a paradoxical feedback loop that leads one down a disturbing rathole indeed.

  zh: 从这个角度看，黄金是一种交易，深思熟虑我的波斯尼亚熟人的轶事，有一个观点——称之为“哦，见鬼”时刻，在此之后，黄金相当不理想，而糖、汽油、一些蔬菜种子、两只山羊、一个蒸馏器，都有更合理的意义。或者，在极端情况下，如果你相信事件，法律崩溃的最优对冲方式可能是成为最恶劣的恶棍，以及/或者加入/与你最恶劣的恶棍结盟，这是一个悖论性的反馈循环，确实让人陷入困境。
