    [A Momentum Renaissance](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2020/10/11/a-momentum-renaissance/)).
    The market did not achieve a Zweig Breadth Thrust buy signal last Thursday as
    I previously indicated, though it was very close.'

- en: As a reminder, the Zweig Breadth Thrust buy signal is triggered when the ZBT
    Indicator moves from an oversold to overbought reading within 10 trading days.
    In my previous publication, I misinterpreted the first day of the window as September
    25, it was actually September 24\. The ZBT reached an overbought condition in
    11 days, not 10, therefore the ZBT buy signal was not triggered.

    with less strict criteria were recently triggered, and it is worthwhile analyzing
    how to trade such conditions.
