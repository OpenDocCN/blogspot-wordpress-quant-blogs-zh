- en: The S&P 500 became extremely stretched in mid-June when its 14-week RSI exceeded
    the 90 level. The last two times this happened, the market eventually pulled back
    and the initial decline was arrested with RSI reached a neutral reading of 50\.
    That 50 target was reached this week, which I interpret as the market is setting
    up for a relief rally.
