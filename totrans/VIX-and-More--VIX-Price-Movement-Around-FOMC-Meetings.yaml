    prior to the FOMC announcement to 10 days following the announcement, from 1990
    to the present . I normalized the EOD VIX on announcement day at 100 to make for
    a more meaningful scale and the following picture jumped out at me:'

    to be short volatility on the day before the FOMC announce and to be long volatility
    the day after the announcement, with the expectation of a volatility mini-crush
    of sorts, on the order of about 3.5% -- with half of that move coming on announcement
    day and the other half of the move coming the day after the announcement.

    some similar observations in May 2004, so I checked to see if the publication
    of that information resulted in a change in the trend.  To my surprise, the trend
    has remained relatively intact in the subsequent 21 data points over the past
    2 ½ years:'

    two following the announcement, rather it has remained lower post-announcement
    in the past 2 ½ years

    most recent data points are defining a new context for FOMC announcement volatility,
    but that possibility bears watching.
