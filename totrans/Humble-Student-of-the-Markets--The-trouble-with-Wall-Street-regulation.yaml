    but policyholders can hang on, refinance (so to speak), or sell off their obligations.
    That is a tough equation for life insurers to work through, and to the degree
    that life settlements are allowed, premiums will have to rise to compensate for
    the loss of profitability.

    of its traders and executives became more and more asymmetric. In effect, they
    were given call options on the cash flow of the firm. Being human beings, they
    behaved accordingly. At the same time, there were fewer and fewer incentives to
    exercise adult supervision.
