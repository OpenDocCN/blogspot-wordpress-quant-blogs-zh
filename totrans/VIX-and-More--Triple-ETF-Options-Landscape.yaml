    I thought readers might find it interesting to see a graphic of some important
    options data on the triple ETFs currently in the market.

    the spreadsheet below captures the average options volume, open interest and current
    implied volatility for the 12 pairs of triple ETFs. I have separated the ETFs
    into four groups: broad index ETFs (market cap focus); sector ETFs; geography
    ETFs; and bond ETFs. I have also color coded the top five pairs in terms of liquidity
    in green, with two additional pairs highlighted in yellow that I believe are liquid
    enough to trade, though they do not yet have the following of the “big five.”'

    lot of additional information of interest can be gleaned from this relatively
    simple graphic.
