    was wrong.

  zh: 我原以为CEP会议会是一个无聊的小研讨会，但我错了。
- en: Gartner ran their conference on Business Process Monitoring on the Monday-Wednesday
    morning, and it dovetailed exactly into the CEP conference. There was also an
    academic conference on CEP that ran concurrently with the BPM conference, so you
    had a lot of academics and curiosity-seekers at the CEP conference.

  zh: Gartner在周一至周三上午举办了他们的业务流程监控会议，与CEP会议完全对接。同时还有一个关于CEP的学术会议与BPM会议同时进行，所以你会有很多学者和好奇者参加CEP会议。
- en: I would estimate that there were about 200 attendees at the CEP conference,
    but probably half were from the vendor community. I counted about 50-60 attendees
    in the financial services track at the conference, and again, about 40-50% were
    vendors. So, there were probably about 30 folks from the financial services industry
    who were really curious about CEP.

  zh: 我估计CEP会议大约有200名与会者，但可能一半以上来自供应商社区。我在会议的金融服务轨道上大约数了50-60名与会者，同样，大约40-50%是供应商。所以，可能大约有30名来自金融服务行业的人对CEP非常好奇。
- en: 'I give these numbers to illustrate that, in financial services, CEP is still
    in the curiousity stage. I am happy to say that most of the people there were
    just as confused as we were (ie: what is the difference between a CEP engine and
    a rules engine, what is the best messaging middleware to use, do we really need
    a visual designer, etc). Most of the people who were using CEP were using it in
    a simple stream case ... pricing, algos, fraud detection, etc. I did not see any
    use cases that approach the magnitude of what we have to do, but then again, I
    don''t expect organizations like Goldman Sachs to advertise what they are doing.'

  zh: 我给出这些数字是为了说明，在金融服务中，CEP仍处于好奇阶段。我很高兴地说，那里的大部分人跟我们一样困惑（比如：CEP引擎和规则引擎的区别是什么，最佳的消息中间件是什么，我们真的需要一个视觉设计师吗等）。使用CEP的大部分人将其用于简单的流案例...
    定价、算法、欺诈检测等。我没有看到任何接近我们所需规模的用例，但话说回来，我不期待像高盛这样的组织会宣传他们在做什么。
- en: It was nice to see some of the vendors trotting out their successes in financial
    services (Aleri with HSBC, CommerzBank and Barcap, Streambase with BofA, Coral8
    with Wombat), and start to establish some meaningful partnerships. Nice to see
    that Coral8 is working closely with RTI.

- en: Mary Knox of Gartner did a nice presentation on what it takes to get CEP adopted
    by a large financial organization, but she compensated for this nice presentation
    by monopolizing the Q&A session with Robert Almgren of BofA. I was a bit puzzled
    by IBM's message about what parts of their CEP framework were already available
    in Message Broker, who was supporting it in IBM, who we get services from, etc.

  zh: Gartner的Mary Knox做了一个关于大型金融机构如何采用CEP的好报告，但她用这个好报告补偿了她在Q&A环节中垄断了BofA的Robert Almgren的时间。我对IBM关于他们的CEP框架中哪些部分已经可以在消息代理中使用的信息感到有点困惑，以及IBM中谁支持它，我们从中获得服务等问题。
- en: I was impressed with Mark from Coral8, who seems to bring that Russian mad scientist
    mentality to his company. Also encouraging to see that Terry Cunningham is at
    the helm at Coral8, fresh from his successes at Crystal and other companies. Terry
    knows what it takes to make a successful software company. They also seem to be
    on the top of their game with financial services, without restricting themselves
    solely to algo trading.

  zh: 我对Coral8的Mark印象深刻，他似乎把那种俄罗斯疯狂科学家的精神带到了他的公司。同样令人鼓舞的是，Terry Cunningham正在Coral8掌舵，他刚从Crystal和其他公司的成功中脱颖而出。Terry知道打造一家成功的软件公司需要什么。他们在金融服务方面似乎也游刃有余，而不仅仅局限于算法交易。
- en: Aleri seems like they have some raw power in their platform, and over time,
    they will be polishing their message more. They win the award for the most genial
    vendors of the conference.
