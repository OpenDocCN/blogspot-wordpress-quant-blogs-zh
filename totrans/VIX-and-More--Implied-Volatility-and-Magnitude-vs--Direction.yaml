    direction? So why is VIX more commonly referred to as a fear index if high VIX
    can imply movements in both directions? I mean- HOW and exactly where does the
    direction get factored into VIX?*'

- en: This question sounds as if it if might have an easy answer.  The problem is
    that when you scratch the surface of [implied volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/implied%20volatility),
    a bunch of other questions have a tendency to pop up and all the tangents make
    it easy for the questioner’s eyes to glaze over.  So, to make a long story a little
    shorter, I have decided that it is time to draft some detailed posts that look
    under the hood at both implied volatility and historical/statistical volatility.  Not
    to worry, this won’t happen today; more likely I will tackle these subjects over
    the course of the next two or three weeks in a series of posts.

    (also known as statistical volatility) looks backward at actual historical price
    movements and calculates volatility in terms of standard deviations over a given
    period of time.  The result is expressed as an annualized volatility number (the
    percentage of one standard deviation), just like the VIX.  Historical volatility
    does not care about the direction of the volatility, only the magnitude.

    psychology and the mechanics of the options marketplace, however, mean that reality
    diverges from theory as options are transacted.  Recall that implied volatility
    is derived from actual options prices.  When the other options pricing variables
    (strike price; price of the underlying; time to expiration; dividends; and risk
    free interests rate) of an option are frozen, this leaves implied volatility as
    the only remaining variable in the options pricing equation.  This is how implied
    volatility is derived.

    the underlying and implied volatility, as the other variables tend to change at
    a slow and/or predictable rate.  When the price of the underlying is relatively
    stable, implied volatility has a tendency to drift down and bring options prices
    with them.  When the price of the underlying (whether it be a stock, ETF, index
    or whatever) moves sharply, this is when things get interesting.  If the underlying
    moves up quickly, it has a tendency to attract new buyers and sellers.  Implied
    volatility usually rises with the move and so do most options prices.  Ultimately,
    implied volatility becomes a function of supply and demand for options at specific
    strikes and expirations.  If new transactions keep hitting the ask price, then
    options prices will move quickly and implied volatility will adjust upward to
    accommodate the new prices.  Sellers will also be inclined to keep raising their
    asking price to account for this demand – again stretching prices and pulling
    implied volatility along for the ride.  Generally, this will not result in a “panic
    buying” situation, particularly if the underlying is an index or an ETF.  Greed
    is not instantaneous; it tends to build over time.  There might be a concern with
    an individual stock that an acquisition is in the works, a legal matter has been
    settled, word of an FDA decision has leaked out, etc., but other than these scenarios
    (which do not apply to an index or an ETF), sharp upward moves tend to be orderly
    and have a relatively limited short-term psychological impact on the investor.

    different dynamics come into play.  First consider the maxim that stocks tend
    to fall faster than they rise.  Second, when it comes to portfolio protection,
    the rush to buy puts to protect an existing position is much more dramatic than
    any sort of call purchases during a bull spike.  Third, the worst case scenario
    for a bear move includes not only the scenarios noted in the paragraph above,
    but incorporates any number of potential disasters from a CEO/CFO resignation
    to accounting irregularities, lowered earnings guidance, new legal challenges,
    etc.  Fourth, as the downward move gathers momentum, investors have a tendency
    to buy whatever puts they can, at the market, for whatever prices are available.  It
    is this insensitivity to prices during a panic selling situation that tends to
    overwhelm the ask price and cause market makers to raise the prices of puts dramatically;
    this, in turn, triggers a sharp jump in implied volatility.

    (i.e., [loss aversion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion)) that translate
    into more panic selling than panic buying also mean that the supply and demand
    imbalance for options is typically greater in sharp bear moves than in sharp bull
    moves.  The result is that implied volatility tends to spike more with an X% drop
    than as a result of an X% rise.  Statistically, these moves are identical, but
    psychologically and from a transaction perspective, spikes down will generally
    move implied volatility more than comparably sized spikes up.  Since the VIX is
    essentially the implied volatility of the SPX, this is one of the reasons why
    the magnitude *and* direction of a market move determine the impact the move will
    have on the VIX.
