- en: Since I have not seen this mentioned elsewhere, I thought I should point out
    that there was an interesting and very unusual divergence in the major U.S. volatility
    indices today. As the chart below shows, both [VXO](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXO)
    and [RVX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/RVX) posted substantial
    gains, up 5.7% and 4.5% respectively. The other three major volatility indices
    declined, with [VXN](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXN) down 1.9%,
    VIX down 2.2% and [VXD](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXD) down
    3.6%.

    are no obvious signs of bad data at work. While correlations among these five
    indices run in the 97% - 99% range and divergences are largely accounted for by
    different market capitalizations, the fact that the two gainers were the large
    cap VXO and the small cap RVX makes today's numbers particularly difficult to
    explain.

- en: Frankly, I am a loss for a good way to account for the discrepancy. The drop
    in the VIX futures and VIX ETNs ([VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX)
    and [VXZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXZ)) suggests to me that
    perhaps VXO and RVX were hit with a similar technical glitch, but I have not seen
    any public statement to support this.
