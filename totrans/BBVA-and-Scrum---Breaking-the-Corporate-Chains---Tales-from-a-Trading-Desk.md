## BBVA and Scrum – Breaking the Corporate Chains

Looks like [BBVA](https://www.finextra.com/newsarticle/29120/bbva-explains-scrum-culture-initiative) are making great strides with [scum](https://info.bbva.com/en/news/general/bbvas-new-ways-of-working-to-accelerate-its-transformation/) within the context of  corporate culture.  Its great to hear they are prepared to break the historical chains that have constrained them, with the obvious Return on Investment (ROI) of business value derived from transformation projects.

> moving away from rigid organizational and functional structures toward a much more collaborative way of working

Anyone know if BBVA are using [SAFe](http://scaledagileframework.com/), [LeSS](https://less.works/), [DAD](http://www.disciplinedagiledelivery.com/introduction-to-dad/) or something else?  Some LinkedIn [profiles](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joinrafa) hint to SAFe.
