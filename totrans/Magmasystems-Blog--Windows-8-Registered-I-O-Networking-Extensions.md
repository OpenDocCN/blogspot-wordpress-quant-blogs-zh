# Magmasystems Blog: Windows 8 Registered I/O Networking Extensions

> 来源：[http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2011/10/windows-8-registered-io-networking.html#0001-01-01](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2011/10/windows-8-registered-io-networking.html#0001-01-01)

[From Len](http://www.serverframework.com/asynchronousevents/2011/10/windows-8-registered-io-networking-extensions.html) *The Registered I/O Networking Extensions, RIO, is a new API that has been added to Winsock to support high-speed networking for increased networking performance with lower latency and jitter. These extensions are targeted primarily for server applications and use pre-registered data buffers and completion queues to increase performance.*

Is Microsoft moving towards the day where people will consider them for a HFT stack?
