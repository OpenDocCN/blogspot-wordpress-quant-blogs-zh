    this post: [An Intermarket Ensemble Model for the S&P500 Using Market Rewind’s
    “Sentiment Spreads”.](http://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2010/09/19/creating-an-ensemble-intermarket-spy-model-with-etf-rewinds-sentiment-spreads/)
    One of [ETF Prophet’s](http://etfprophet.com/) contributors and the initial thinker
    for the spreads, [Mr. Pietsch](http://marketrewind.blogspot.com/) commented on
    CSS’s use of the sentiment spreads to predict the S&P 500\. The part that spiked
    my interest was the very last question: *what can you tell us about improving
    performance yet again with weak learner methodologies?* While originally directed
    to Mr. Varadi, I felt compelled to try the idea.'

    vector machine prediction model. You can think of the process as mapping the information
    contained in the spreads in relation to the ETF tracking the S&P 500\. This approach,
    a weak form of ensemble learning is the next level after single indicator/variable
    model. Conceptually, one can think of market movements as the aggregation of a
    high (very) quantity of information and data. Trying to process the market and
    generate signals using a single raw filter/signal/strategy has a small chance
    to succeed for a long time without adaptation. Using multi-variables adaptive
    models/strategies tends to increase the odds in our favour. I would argue that
    two of the most important variables to take in consideration are price action
    and inter market effects. Most technical indicator covers the price action angle.
    These sentiment spreads are a simple way to introduce the other very important
    part into a quantitative strategy. For now, I will only take these into consideration,
    but I plan to expand on this and show how we can combine price action and intermarket
    effects to our best advantage. The following results are from using a ![\nu](img/06708148c2c0571651f5805389590ab7.png)-svm
    classification model trained on the last 100 days of spread. Note that the sample
    is very small since I wanted to take all seven spreads together, it will be interesting
    to see how it plays out with more data to our disposition and to test it using
    intraday data.
