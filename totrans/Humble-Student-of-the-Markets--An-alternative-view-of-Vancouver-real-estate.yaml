    A “good” detached house on Vancouver’s west side is around $2 million, give or

    the math. There are cheaper houses in the suburbs and better paying jobs, but
    these examples vividly illustrate the affordability problem.

    Ahead of the Chinese takeover of Hong Kong in 1997, there was a significant influx

    of the poor fresh-off-the-boat immigrants of the past, but brash and wealthy.
    As a result, Vancouver earned the nickname “Hongcouver” for a brief time. There
    continues to be Asian money coming into Vancouver. Today, instead of Hong Kong

    make these sums even more significant. Assume that the manufacturing sector produces
    revenues of $40 billion a year through exports. Assuming a generous 10 percent
    profit margin, actual profits would be $4 billion a year. ***In the case of narcotics,
    however, profit margins are conservatively estimated to stand at around 80 percent.
    The net from $40 billion would be $32 billion; to produce equivalent income in
    manufacturing, exports would have to total $320 billion.***
