- en: The returns of my Trend Asset Allocation Model have been strong. Based on an
    "out of sample" record of signals from 2013 and a simulated portfolio that varies
    up to +/- 20% from a 60/40 benchmark, the model portfolio has managed to achieve
    equity-like returns with 60/40-like risk. Performance has also been consistently
    positive in the shorter time frames (to July 26, 2022).

- en: The Trend Model turned neutral from bullish in January 2022 and turned bearish
    in March. Amidst all the gloom about a global recession, it's time to become more
    constructive on equities. The signal has been upgraded to neutral from bearish.
