    work? Bloomberg reports that a recent poll shows that he is narrowing the lead
    on Hollande. Even though his socialist challenger is in the lead, Sarkozy has
    shown himself to be a formidable campaigner. Hollande is being pulled to the left
    with his proposals to raise the top marginal tax rate and to lower the retirement
    age back to 60 from 62, which may hurt him.

    new president will have to deal with the bond market vigilantes, who will be out
    in force shortly after the election. No doubt Merkel and the Germans would prefer
    to deal with Sarkozy because he is the devil they know, Hollande has also shown
    himself to be European in outlook and he is committed to the European Union and
    understands the consequences of a eurozone breakup. If he were to get elected,
    we will no doubt seem some back-and-forth which leads to a watered version Grand
    Plan 2.0, but Europe is likely to continue to proceed down the reform path.
