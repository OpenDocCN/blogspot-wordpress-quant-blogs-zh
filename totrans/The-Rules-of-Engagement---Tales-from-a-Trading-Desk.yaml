    familiar with a few rules I adhere to as part of business.  Many years ago, a
    colleague mentioned that the main character (Gibbs) from the NCIS TV series has
    a similar (ish) set of rules, which can be found [here](http://ncis.wikia.com/wiki/Leroy_Jethro_Gibbs/Rules). 
    Another colleague in a tier-1 investment bank continues to use a number of my
    rules that he was introduced too 13 years ago.  Enjoy 🙂
