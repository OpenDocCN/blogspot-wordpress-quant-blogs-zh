    I thought it might be helpful to look at correlation of PIMCO mutual funds to
    the S&P 500.  Unfortunately due to the large number of funds, I cannot use the
    chart.Correlation from PerformanceAnalytics.  I think I have made a pretty correlation
    heatmap of PIMCO institutional share funds with inception prior to 5 years ago. 
    Of course this eliminates many of the new strategies, but it is easy in the code
    to adjust the list.  I added the Vanguard S&P 500 fund (VFINX) as a reference
    point.  Then, I orderded the correlation heat map by correlation to VFINX.

    income) with negative/low correlation to the S&P 500 and those with strong positive
    correlation.'

    but gets a little busy.

    might be more helpful.
