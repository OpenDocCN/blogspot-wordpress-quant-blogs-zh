one more smoking gun with the government's fingerprints all over it. Yep, Its all the "free" markets fault. Sure.

He announced this in LAS VEGAS! How appropriate.

Well.... it is the Free Market's fault, as long as you understand that the market has to co-exist alongside representative democracy.

You can either argue for un-bailoutable but uninterfered with markets in the context of the abolition of elected represesntatives (because they will always bail out any industry whose collapse would cause a 'systemic risk') or you can accept that the market needs to be regulated and interfered with a good deal more than it is.

But if you want to adopt the former position, you really should start arguing - loudly and clearly - for the abolition of elections.

Oh - and the idea that the sub-prime problem was wholy - or even mainly - a result of government interference is one that doesn't really stand up.

I don't think gov't is necessary and sufficient, but I think this mindset--ownership morally good, no risk--led to the overreach. Clearly many players all were necessary, none sufficient.
