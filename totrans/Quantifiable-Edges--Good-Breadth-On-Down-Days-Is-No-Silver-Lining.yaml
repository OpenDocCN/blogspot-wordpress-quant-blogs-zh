    stocks. This is the 2nd day in a row this has occurred. Most people will tell
    you that positive breadth readings on down days suggest bullish implications.
    I decided to look and see what happened following back to back days of good breadth
    and lower index prices since 1970.

    a mild underperformance of long-term drift. You could even say it’s basically
    neutral. Bullish though? I see nothing bullish in the above numbers.

    still underperformed the long-term drift of the market. Positive breadth on a
    down day should not be considered a silver lining.
