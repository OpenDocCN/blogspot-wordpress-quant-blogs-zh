    momentum signal that''s been triggered only six times since Marty Zweig wrote
    the book that outlined his signal. The stock market has risen every time 12 months
    after the buy signals. It requires the Zweig Breath Thrust Indicator (ZBT) to
    rise from an oversold to an overbought condition within 10 trading days, which
    is indeed an rare occurrence.'

- en: While the ZBT buy signal is extremely rare, the ZBT Indicator can serve as a
    useful short-term trading indicator when it is oversold. In the past, this has
    served to indicate favorable risk-reward long entry points, which seems to be
    the situation today.
