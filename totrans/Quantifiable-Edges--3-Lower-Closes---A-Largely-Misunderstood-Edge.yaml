- en: The S&P 500 closed lower for the 3rd day in a row yesterday. Three lower closes
    is often cited as having an upside edge. And it does – kind of. That edge is often
    misunderstood, though. The first place I saw 3 lower closes quantified was in
    Larry Connors book “How Markets Really Work”. One of the chapters in the book
    looked at consecutive days higher and lower. It basically found that after the
    market has moved in 1 direction for several days, there is a tendency for it to
    revert.

    over that period. It wasn’t specific to this particular setup.) When Larry measured
    3 lower closes he looked at any time the market had pulled back for at least 3
    days in a row and then showed performance statistics for the following days. What
    many traders fail to realize when they review his research is that there is a
    large historical difference between “at least” 3 days in a row and “exactly 3”
    days in a row. I decided to examine this in some detail tonight.

    for at LEAST 3 days in a row and then selling the next day. Keep in mind, if it
    is down again day 4 it will be bought again. Same with day 5, 6, 7 etc. until
    there is finally an up day.

- en: There are a few things to note here. First, trying to buy all 3+ day pullbacks
    prior to 1987 was a losing strategy. After that it the market showed less tendency
    to trend and an increased tendency reverse. Buying 3+ day drops became profitable.
    The period covered by the blue arrow shows the period covered in “How Markets
    Really Work”.

    lower closes. In other words, the third day lower was bought. The position was
    exited the next day. If the market continued to head south it was ignored. There
    was no further buying on day 4, 5, or 6.

- en: There is a striking difference between the two graphs. There does appear to
    be a recent upside edge, but most of it is concentrated on some outlier trades
    that occurred in the last year. Until very recently there was no advantage to
    buying the third close lower in a row.
  prefs: []

- en: Why the stark differences? I believe much of the reason is due to the strength
    of the eventual snapback. The more stretched the market gets to the downside,
    the greater the snapback typically is. The “3 or more” study guarantees a winning
    trade in every sequence. In other words, it will continue to buy each day until
    it has a winning day. Only after that will the count reset. The further the market
    drops, the more vicious the snapback is likely to be.

    – present. The left hand column is the number of days the market moved lower.
    The right hand column is the average up day the following day. (Down/losing days
    are not looked at here.)

    time periods on the 2nd equity chart where buying three lower closes has actually
    provided an edge on the 4th day. Those 2 time periods were during the current
    and prior bear markets.

- en: So is there really an edge to buying (exactly) three lower closes? Recently
    during bear market periods – yes. Historically, no. Of course if you understand
    the mean reversion will likely eventually take place, you can still take advantage
    of the pullback. You will need some patience, though. Below is a chart of buying
    day 3 and holding for 3 days (rather than 1).

- en: This chart looks more like the 3 OR MORE chart shown above. In this case it
    is due to the longer holding period. The longer you hold the more likely you are
    to participate in the eventual snapback.
  prefs: []

- en: The bottom line is that 3 lower closes may indicate the market is getting stretched.
    The market will likely bounce some time soon. It doesn’t normally offer much of
    a day 4 edge on its own, though.
