    was [launched](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/02/new-feature-2-portfolio123-live.html),
    I feel that sufficient time has elapsed to begin taking a cursory look at some
    of the portfolio statistics.

- en: The first statistic that jumps out at me is *annual turnover*.  While many may
    see a 327% annual turnover rate as high, this portfolio is designed to be actively
    traded, with the potential for turnover as high as 2000-3000% per year.  So far,
    the system has culled three of the original five holdings.  Of those three, only
    [RIO](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=rio) has been a high performer since it was
    dropped from the portfolio.  On the other hand, the post-sale performance of [NTY](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=nty)
    and [PCCC](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=pccc) has been middling at best.  So it
    appears that the system is doing a good job of cutting free losers – and I have
    no problem erring on the side of doing this too soon rather than too late.

    holdings are up at least 13% to date.  The laggard, [WCG](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=wcg),
    is up 2%, but it has only been two weeks since it was added to the portfolio.  Again,
    this is just the type of performance I am looking for.

- en: From a risk perspective, I look at *[maximum drawdown](http://www.andreassteiner.net/performanceanalysis/?Risk_Measurement:Absolute_Risk:Maximum_Drawdown)*,
    which is the maximum peak to trough drop, regardless of time period.  In the case
    of Portfolio A1, the 2/27 correction resulted in a 13% drawdown from the 2/26
    high – a period during which the S&P 500 lost a little over 6%.

    stock [betas](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/01/102401.asp) and correlations
    are an important component of portfolio risk.  Four of the five stocks have betas
    in the 1.2 to 2.2 range; the fifth, [AMKR](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=amkr),
    currently has a beta of about 5.0, which is partly responsible for why the current
    weighted average beta of the portfolio is 2.6.  With the increased passage of
    time, I will look to the [Sharpe Ratio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharpe_ratio)
    as a means of measuring risk-adjusted returns.

    benchmark return, with the benchmark being the S&P 500 in this case) are two numbers
    that I keep a very close eye on.  I am pleased to report that Portfolio A1’s return
    of 7% for the first two months is 5% better than the 2% return logged by the S&P
    500.
