- en: A few weeks ago I discovered that I have an alter ego over at optionMONSTER
    who thinks about and writes daily about the same subjects *VIX and More* likes
    to tackle. I am speaking of Chris McKhann, whose [How to Use VIX Options for Insurance](http://www.optionmonster.com/news/article.jsp?page=commentary/in_the_news/how_to_use_vix_options_for_insurance_30046.html),
    is available for those who do not mind going through the free registration process
    that is required to access all the free content at optionMONSTER.

- en: Chris makes some important points about [VIX options](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20options),
    notably that they are priced off of [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures).
    He adds that one can get a relative sense of the how expensive VIX options are
    by comparing the cash/spot VIX to the VIX futures. This approach is similar to
    using the [VIX:VXV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%3AVXV) ratio
    and is something that I will discuss in this space in the near future.
