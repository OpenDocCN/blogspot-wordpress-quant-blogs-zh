- en: The study below was from the Quantifinder yesterday and was last seen in the
    1/26/11 subscriber letter. It suggests that when SPY closes strong (in the top
    10% of its range) but still only manages a small gain on the day, that the next
    day has a downside tendency. Stats are updated.

    And while not terribly large, the edge has been fairly consistent over time. Just
    a little pattern to keep in mind today and in the future…
