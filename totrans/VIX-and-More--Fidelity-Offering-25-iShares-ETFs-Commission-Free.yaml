    company fired in important competitive salvo when they announced that starting
    today 25 iShares ETFs will be available for trading through Fidelity on a commission-free
    basis.

- en: The 25 ETFs include 16 U.S. equity index ETFs, 4 ETFs based on international
    equity indices and 5 bond ETFs that cover a broad range of issuers, geographies
    and credit quality. The table below attempts to slice and dice these commission-free
    ETFs in a an way that should help investors who are unaware of some or all of
    these ETFs better understand their characteristics.

    on bold blue font. Each of these ETFs trades 20 million shares or more per day
    on average and has a highly liquid options market. In fact, [EEM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EEM)
    and [IWM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/IWM) are among the top five
    most actively traded ETFs. In addition to these three heavyweights, I have also
    highlighted in italicized blue font the eight other ETFs in this group which trade
    an average of at least 1 million shares per day. The next most liquid ETFs are
    in black font. Finally, I have reserved the red font for the seven ETFs that do
    not have options associated with them. Not surprisingly, the underlying ETFs are
    also among the least liquid of the group.

    U.S. equity; international equity; and bonds categories. For the U.S. equity ETFs,
    I have further subdivided these ETFs into [Morningstar style box](http://www.morningstar.com/InvGlossary/morningstar_style_box.aspx)
    categories. For international equity ETFs, I decompose these according to market
    cap and developed/emerging market exposure. Finally, for bond ETFs, these are
    broken down by issuer and credit quality.'

    of commission costs may now want to rethink some of those ideas in the context
    of the Fidelity/iShares commission-free ETFs. As for options traders, some stock-option
    strategies such as [buy-writes](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/buy-write)
    now may deserve another look as well.
