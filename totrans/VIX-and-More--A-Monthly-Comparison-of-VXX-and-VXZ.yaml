    has about four times as many assets as its mid-term sibling, [VXZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXZ).
    When it comes to public relations and media column inches, I imagine the ratio
    is more like 50-1 in the favor of VXX. In many ways VXZ is the unloved stepchild
    of the duo.

    [ZIV is Undeservedly Neglected](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2012/01/ziv-undeservedly-neglected.html).
    I believe the same case holds for VXZ. One of the great difficulties in trading
    VIX-based ETPs is that while the potential returns are enormous, when things move
    in the wrong direction, a bad trade can spiral out of control and trigger an extremely
    painful loss with surprising speed. This is a large part of what makes VXZ more
    attractive than VXX. Even though VXZ is relatively volatile, with a current 30-day
    historical volatility of 39.5, it pales in comparison to the 70.1 30-day HV of
    its rocket-fueled short-term brother, VXX. In this case, the slower the train
    wreck, the more easily it can be avoided and position [risk](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/risk)
    becomes much more manageable.

    [contango](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/contango) and [roll yield](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/roll%20yield)
    issues that plague VXX. In fact, on average VXZ is only subjected to about 1/3
    of the negative roll yield that impacts VXX, which is a large part of the reason
    why the long-term performance of VXZ is much superior to the numbers put up by
    VXX. To illustrate this point, the chart below shows the month-by-month performance
    data for VXX and VXZ going back two years.

    but if you have some patience and want better odds, VXZ is often a better long
    volatility play.
