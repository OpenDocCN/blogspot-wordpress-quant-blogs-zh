- en: The VIX has been steadily declining during the month of December, from the high
    60s on the first day of the month to the neighborhood of 42 as I write this.

- en: Clearly the extraordinary measures taken by the government to pump liquidity
    into the system have been responsible for some of the shrinking volatility, but
    since I often talk about the [holiday effect](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Holiday%20Effect)
    on volatility and frequently receive questions on the subject, I thought it would
    be a good day to share some of my research on the subject.

- en: Since 1990, the month of December has averaged 21.05 trading days. The chart
    below captures each of those 21 trading days from 1990-2007 in composite form,
    with the mean for all December VIX values set at 100\. In the chart, the pattern
    of decreasing volatility is most evident from the middle of the month to just
    before Christmas, during which period volatility drops from 2.4% above the December
    average (10^(th) trading day) to 4.8% below the December average (17^(th) trading
    day).

    the historical low point in volatility for December.

    be the last time the VIX dips under 42 for awhile, but those with an interest
    in historical context may wish to prepare for an increase in volatility, as the
    holiday ‘[calendar reversion](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/calendar%20reversion)’
    effect wears off.
