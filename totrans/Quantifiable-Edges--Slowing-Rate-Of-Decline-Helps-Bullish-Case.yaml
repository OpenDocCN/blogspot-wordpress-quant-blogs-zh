    each of the last three days, the rate of decline has slowed. (SPX down 3.8%, then
    -1.5%, and now -0.2%.) I ran a test to study the significance of a slowing rate
    of decline. First I looked at a baseline test showing all returns after a 3-day
    decline under the 200 day moving average.

    last two days.

    is waning. Implications are somewhat bullish when compared to typical three day
    pullbacks.
