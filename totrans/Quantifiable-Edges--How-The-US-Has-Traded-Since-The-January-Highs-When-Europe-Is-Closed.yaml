- en: Much of the time when the market has had bad days as of late people have pointed
    to troubles in Greece and Europe as the reason. I decided to isolate the US market
    a bit to see how much of the selling really could be attributed to Europe’s woes.
    The top pane of the chart shows closing half-hour readings for the SPY from the
    market top in the middle of January through Thursday’s close. The bottom pane
    shows an indicator that measures the movement of the US market from the time Europe
    is all closed at 11:30 EST until the NYSE closes at 4pm EST.

    11:30 – 4:00 SPY broke out Thursday above the January highs.

    love to hear others thoughts and interpretations...
