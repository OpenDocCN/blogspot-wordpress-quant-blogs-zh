- en: I have a portfolio-based strategy that uses a probabalistic model to determine
    the “optimal” portfolio allocation vector for each trading period.    This can
    be applied either intra-day, daily, or across longer ranges of time. The dynamics
    and composition of the portfolio may change depending on holding period.

- en: The algorithm uses an online learning and optimization approach.   Because this
    is computationally expensive, want to do some up-front analysis to determine the
    composition of the portfolio, i.e. what set of assets will provide a good degree
    of balance and information for weighting decisions.

- en: So for instance, if we chose the S&P 500 stocks as the pool from which to select,
    which of these stocks should be selected?   There are many approaches to this
    and it really depends on the characteristic of your strategy.   A “buy & hold”
    style mutual fund manager is going to pick based on fundamentals with a view on
    growth over a medium – long term period and in keeping portfolio volatility within
    some limit.

- en: In the case of this strategy, I am market neutral and look to have both appreciating
    and declining assets (provided there is sufficient liquidity).   However, as with
    buy & hold style portfolio managers I am also looking to provide a certain amount
    of diversification and balance in the portfolio.

- en: A nice way to look at the basic relationships amongst assets is via a maximum
    spanning tree on the correlations between assets.   The idea is that such a graph
    spans all assets but each asset connects to only its strongest relationship.

- en: One starts with a “seed” asset and determines the strongest relationship with
    another from the set and traverses recursively.   Additionally only include assets
    with relationships above a given correlation threshold weeding out assets with
    weak relationships.

    carrying less information than a spanning tree in terms of relationship strength.**
