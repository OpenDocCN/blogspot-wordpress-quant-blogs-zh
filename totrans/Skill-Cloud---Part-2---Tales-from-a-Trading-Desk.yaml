    that discuss team [interactions](http://et.nwresd.org/files/The%20Value%20of%20Keeping%20Teams%20Together.pdf),

    risks, a Skill’s Cloud should be populated with historical team interactions –
    big data small data dataset, thus allowing a project to assess how quickly the
    team will begin interacting and working to solve a problem, coupled with the possible
