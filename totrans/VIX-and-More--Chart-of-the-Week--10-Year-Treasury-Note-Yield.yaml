- en: I’ll be the first to admit that I have never considered myself a ‘bond guy’
    and I spend much less time than I probably should studying the bond market. That
    being said, I know I have quite a few equity-centric readers who think the bond
    market moves too slowly to warrant their attention. The attitude is frequently,
    “I’ll never be a bond trader, so why should I spend my time watching bonds?”

- en: My quick answer to bond skeptics is that bonds can help to divine the direction
    of interest rates and bonds frequently make major market turns before stocks do.
    Additionally, with the advent of [bond ETFs](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/bond%20ETFs)
    such as the highly liquid [TLT](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TLT)
    (and its +3x and -3x counterparts, [TMF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TMF)
    and [TMV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TMV)), it is now much easier
    for the retail investor to trade the U.S. Treasury long bond and their volatile
    triple ETF counterparts, as well as some of the shorter-dated Treasury ETFs, such
    as [IEF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/IEF), which is comprised
    of U.S. Treasury Notes with a target maturity of 7-10 years.

    week’s [chart of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week)
    as the bond number for non-bond people to follow. The chart is the yield on the
    10-Year U.S. Treasury Note, which is the de facto benchmark for government and
    sometimes even for corporate bonds as well.

    buyers](http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-04-11/blackrock-lured-by-4-treasury-notes-shunned-at-pimco-update1-.html)
    such as BlackRock ([BLK](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/BLK)), which
    found the steep [yield curve](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/yield%20curve)
    a good reason to buy some of the 10-Year Treasury Notes.

    such as the link between bonds and stocks, an excellent place to start is with
    John Murphy’s [Intermarket Analysis](http://www.amazon.com/Intermarket-Analysis-Profiting-Relationships-Trading/dp/0471023299/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1201536930&sr=1-2).
