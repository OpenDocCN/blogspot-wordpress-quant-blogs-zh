# Humble Student of the Markets: Signs of the Apocalypse?

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2010/04/signs-of-apocalypse.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2010/04/signs-of-apocalypse.html#0001-01-01)

The economy appears to be rebounding from a very nasty recession which was induced by a credit crisis. Unfortunately, a lot of people don’t seem to have learned their lesson and they are behaving like 16 year olds again. Otherwise, what else should we make of these developments?

*   The [Wall Street Journal](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704094104575143590175491142.html) reports that covenant-lite loans are making a comeback.
*   [Junk bonds resurgent](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/junk-bonds-swaps-show-companies-flush-with-credit-2010-04-02): Companies sold $54.3 billion in U.S. high-yield debt during the first quarter of the year, according to Dealogic, up from $9.6 billion a year ago.
*   [Bloomberg](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601109&sid=aH_4WjvZMGrE&pos=) reports that the house flipper is back, or vulture investors looking to buy and flip distressed properties.
*   [Mebane Faber](http://www.mebanefaber.com/2010/03/31/schwabs-new-advertising/) highlighted last week that Schwab is advertising its low margin rates.
*   The new [Age of Frugality](http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2010/04/01/the-age-of-frugality-takes-a-holiday/) is history. (Well, that lasted a long time.)
*   From [FT Alphaville](http://ftalphaville.ft.com/blog/2010/04/06/195931/from-cdos-to-ems-what-could-go-wrong/): “displaced credit experts” have shifted their focus away from CDOs and other structured products to emerging markets in South America and Asia.

Meanwhile, the [Fed is keeping its eye out for speculative bubbles](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Fed-keeps-eyes-out-for-apf-3930377589.html?x=0&sec=topStories&pos=main&asset=dc0f6968c8c32a0c87af5ef10bfe8c10&ccode=mp) so that they don't get out of hand. (I am glad they are so vigilant.)

Is it time to put on the risk trade or are these ***Signs of the Apocalypse***?
