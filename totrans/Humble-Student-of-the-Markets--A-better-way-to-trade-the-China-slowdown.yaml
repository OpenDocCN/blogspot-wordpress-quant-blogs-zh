    investors seeking to get a read on an economy caught in a multi-year slowdown

    a pick-up in a program to swap high-cost local government debt for cheaper municipal
    bonds, the People’s Bank of China said in a statement on its website on Saturday.
    No less than 350 billion yuan ($53.6 billion) of such swaps were conducted last
    month, while aggregating financing growth was affected partly by a decrease in
    corporate bond issuance, according to the central bank.
