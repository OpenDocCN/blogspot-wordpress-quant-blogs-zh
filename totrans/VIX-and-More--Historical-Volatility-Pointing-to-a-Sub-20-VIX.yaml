    (HV), I note that the combination of 10/20/30/50/100 day HV has plummeted to levels
    not seen since mid-October 2007, which happens to be one week after the all-time
    high in the S&P 500 index.

    starting to kick in and the drama associated with today’s FOMC meeting now behind
    us, I now believe there is about a 50% chance that the VIX dips below 20 in the
    next two days, even with the E-mini S&P 500 futures ([/ES](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/%2FES))
    down 4.50 as I type this. The alternative, which has been the status quo as of
    late, is that the 20 area acts as support for the VIX and triggers resistance
    in stocks.

    HV continues to fall, the case for a 20+ VIX will deteriorate rapidly. Substantial
    divergences tend to have a relatively short life. With the current divergence
    now at six trading days, the VIX can only defy gravity for a short while longer…
