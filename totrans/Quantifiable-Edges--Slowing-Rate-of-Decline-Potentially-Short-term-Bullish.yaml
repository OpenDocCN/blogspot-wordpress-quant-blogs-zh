- en: when the market was trading below its 200-day moving average. I decided to test
    it out when above the 200ma as well. I found that prior to 1987 there was no bullish
    influence based on the pattern. Since 1987 one has appeared. Here is the test
    using the SPY. First the base case without the slowing rate of decline requirement.
