    which are on track to trade over 100,000 as a pair today for the first time since
    their launch two weeks ago.  In deciding where to plot these two issues, I note
    that the 10-day historical volatility of VMAX and VMIN is approximately 30% higher
    than their more popular competitors,

    I am electing to assume that based on the early history, the target maturity is
    in the 2-3 week range.  Additionally, while there is no leverage being used in

    I have also plotted VMAX and VMIN as having slightly higher "leverage" than the
    group of VIX ETPs that have a target maturity of thirty days, such as VXX, XIV,
    etc.

    interest in the trading community, as these products have features that should
    be very attractive to short-term traders.  For now, the bid ask-spreads are typically
    in the 0.05 – 0.10 range, but as these tighten up, I expect volume and trading
    interest will ramp up quickly.
