    is nothing to panic about. As long as the heavyweights hold up and the fundamentals
    remain sound, the stock market can remain healthy. With that point in mind, I
    analyzed the quality of the current leadership from a sector perspective. The
    current sector leaders are Healthcare (16% of SPX), Consumer Discretionary (11%)
    and Financials (16%). The laggards are Industrials (11%), Energy (8%) and Materials
    (3%). So the bulls are winning with a combined weight of 43% in the winning sectors
    compared to 21% in lagging sectors.

    stocks. The top panel depicts the relative performance of the sector compared
    to the market, which shows that Healthcare remains in a healthy relative uptrend,
    and the bottom panel shows the relative performance of the equal vs. float-weighted
    indices within Healthcare (apples-to-apples comparison of the same stocks with
    different weights). While the equal weighted outperformance ended in April, the
    bottom panel shows that they remain range-bound and therefore confirms the relative
    uptrend of Healthcare stocks. So far, so good.

    I thought it worthwhile comparing IPO stats to the SP 500 index to see if it provides
    any clues. There are some tentative clues but before we discuss the data and charts
    it’s worth thinking about the logic or intuition. More IPOs mean more supply of
    stock (all else equal – although it’s not quite equal because strictly speaking
    you should look at *net* supply - IPOs and capital raisings less buybacks). IPOs
    also happen in greater frequency in boom times because usually in boom times the
    economy is going well and it’s much easier for new companies to be successful
    and thus go on to do IPOs. Also, the pricing is better and the greater market
    enthusiasm increases the likelihood that the IPO will be successful.

    are booming, and if the economy or market stops booming it will be harder to sustain
    IPO activity. So, we have a supply argument and a cycle argument that says there
    should be information in IPO activity. In terms of the charts there is a loose
    link: IPO proceeds (amount of capital raised) moves in line with the market as
    you would expect. When it rolls over it can mean a change in trend or rolling
    over of the cycle – however, it is more or less a coincident indicator. The monthly
    pace of IPO filings is also a potentially useful indicator where a surge in filings
    can flag a short-term top in the market. Looking at the longer-term data for the
    number of IPOs, it’s a little tricky because in the past there were many more
    IPOs than in recent times. So in terms of its efficacy it is ‘mixed’ but it is
    another information point worth considering. There is a potential red flag in
    that there was a surge in filings and the volume and proceeds seem to have rolled

- en: As I look ahead to next week, my inner trader is having trouble getting excited
    about being overly bullish or bearish. We saw a market bounce. Though I continue
    to believe that stocks are likely to pull back and possibly test the lows saw
    last Tuesday, it's not a high conviction call.

    I am leaning slightly bearish. The RSI(5) or RSI(14) are both in neutral territory
    and the latter momentum indicator continues to be range-bound and has not flashed
    an overbought or oversold reading in all of 2015\. However, volume studies does
    show that market rallies have been on declining volume and market weakness has
    been accompanied by rising volume, which is a cautionary sign. As well, the VIX
    Index (bottom panel) is at support and at the bottom of its 2015 range, which
    is also bearish.

    uptrend and it is rolling over. We are also seeing negative divergences on RSI(5)
    and RSI(14). While it does suggest that the market will weaken, it does not indicate
    magnitude. A test of the Tuesday lows is not necessarily in the cards next week.

    a rebound in the 1-3 week time frame, though the sample size is very small at
    six. If this were to be the scenario, then look for a pullback, but don't expect
    a test of the lows seen last Tuesday.
