    even more from a lack of buying interest than from selling pressure.

- en: The [chart of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week)
    below is an attempt to use two basic indicators to capture the lack of volume
    and market breadth that has undermined the March to mid-June rally. As a measure
    of market volume, I have chosen to highlight [on balance volume](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/on%20balance%20volume)
    (OBV), which is a running total of the volume on up days minus the volume on down
    days. This indicator is excellent at highlighting trends which are at risk due
    to declining volume, which is exactly what the warning suggested when there was
    a peak in OBV during the first two weeks of May.

  zh: 下面的[本周图表](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week)尝试使用两个基本指标来捕捉自3月份中旬至6月份的上涨行情中所受的成交量不足和市场广度不足的问题。作为市场成交量的衡量指标，我选择突出显示[平衡成交量](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/on%20balance%20volume)（OBV），即上涨日的成交量减去下跌日的成交量的累计值。这个指标非常擅长于突出因成交量下降而面临风险的趋势，这正是5月初两周OBV达到峰值时所暗示的警告。
- en: In a similar vein, the [McClellan Summation Index](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/McClellan%20Summation%20Index)
    (aka the NYSE Summation Index or NYSI) shows market breadth as derived from the
    net daily advancing stocks minus declining stocks. The McClellan Summation Index
    did turn up at the end of February, just before the March bottom and is generally
    an excellent tool for gauging trends in market breadth.

- en: In addition to the May highs, note that both OBV and the McClellan Summation
    Index have recently made lower highs as well. While OBV shows some indications
    of steadying at current levels, the larger concern is the decline in market breadth
    issues highlighted by the McClellan Summation Index.

  zh: 除了5月份的高点外，请注意OBV和麦克莱伦广度指数（McClellan Summation Index）最近也创下了较低的高点。虽然OBV显示出在当前水平稳定的迹象，但更大的担忧是麦克莱伦广度指数所显示的市场广度问题下降。
- en: Like all indicators, these two are far from perfect, but they often provide
    important information about the decline in strength and potential for reversal
    in major trends.
