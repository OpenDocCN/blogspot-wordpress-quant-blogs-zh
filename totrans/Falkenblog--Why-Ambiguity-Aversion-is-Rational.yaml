    forwards,' which is kind of sad--as is much existentialism--because it emphasizes
    how much time we spend on things we can't affect. Leave it to the government to
    make this an economic policy.

    junk status. The smoking gun is that while the deal was done with an assumed collateral
    issue that would be investment grade, by early 2007 the market was already tanking,
    and the issuer had subprime collateral. An email documents S&P was aware of this.

    got away with it because AAA securities tend to have multiple levels of redundancy,
    belts and suspenders. Securitization became very complicated over the years, with
    many different tranches and waterfalls, and alas any explicit, complicated process
    invites its circumvention, so issuers and borrowers eventually figured out the
    mortgage-CDO game and pushed weaker and weaker collateral into them until they
    finally imploded. Those screaming warnings while it was happening were ignored

    which an agent had, with the benefit of hindsight, made a mistake, he looks not
    just unlucky, but incompetent or malicious. In experiments, a lottery ticket is
    worth a lot less after the drawing for most people even if they don''t know what
    the true number is, and seemingly the seller does not either. People shy away
    from processes about which they think they have insufficient, as opposed to probabilistic,
    information, even if framed identically (eg, both with a 50% chance). This is
    ambiguity aversion.'

    be attributed to poor judgment. If all possible information about a risky prospect
    was known, failure can only be bad luck. The key is, ex post, can you look like
    a sucker or just unlucky? Investment managers can live with bad luck, but their
    reputation is essential and they can't be seen a fool.

    from, classical risk aversion, and probably explains why lenders are now so afraid
    to lend: if they make a mistake now, it won''t be merely a bad investment, but
    a crime. Life is a lot more like a game of incomplete information than a roulette
