- en: A vast majority of software projects start out with no though as to what should
    go into log files. ¬†Log files are effectively a 3rd class citizen in the software
    development thought process. ¬†I‚Äôve seen a few companies mandate certain data in
    log files for projects to ease the transition from development to production ‚Äì
    handover to support (both infrastructure and application). ¬†Having spent some
    time using [ELK](https://www.elastic.co/products), ingesting log files from applications
    that really aren‚Äôt structured very well, I now believe that [ELK](http://brewhouse.io/blog/2014/11/04/big-data-with-elk-stack.html)
    is an easy way for development teams to eat their own dog food.
