# VIX and More: The Impact of Financials and Energy Stocks on the VIX

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/07/impact-of-financials-and-energy-stocks.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/07/impact-of-financials-and-energy-stocks.html#0001-01-01)

The rapidly changing fortunes of financial institutions and energy stocks have been widely chronicled – so much so that there is no need to repeat the details here.

The implications of the shift away from financials and toward energy touch upon several issues that I have not yet seen addressed in the media. One of the obvious ones is the composition of various stock indices. In the S&P 500 index (SPX), for instance, just from 2007 to the present, financials have dropped from 22% of the index to 14% of the index, while energy stocks have surged from 10% to 16% of the index. The change is particularly important when one considers that financials (

) have historically been highly correlated to the SPX (0.91 over the course of the past year), while the energy sector (

) has typically had the lowest correlation to the SPX (-0.28 for the past year).

Consider that in the past year, the index has been tilting away from financials and toward energy stocks, essentially swapping a positive 0.91 correlation for a negative 0.28 correlation. Given that the VIX is based on SPX options, there can be little wonder why the VIX has been moving more lethargically as of late: an increasingly dominant sector – the energy group – is pulling in the opposite direction of the other sectors. The result? Sector gridlock is dampening the movements of the SPX and of SPX derivatives, like the VIX.
