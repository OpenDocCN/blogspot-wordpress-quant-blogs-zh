    markets for the first time ever over the course of the past year after becoming
    tired of being blind-sided by inter-market relationships.

    the [TED spread](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TED%20spread), OIS-LIBOR
    and others have received a fair amount of press as of late as measures of liquidity.
    More traditional bond market indicators focus more on risk than liquidity and
    include the spread between corporate and government bonds or between investment
    grade and high yield corporate bonds.

    on the workings of the global economy. The PowerShares Emerging Markets Sovereign
    Debt Portfolio is an ETF that carries the ticker [PCY](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=PCY).
    Launched in October 2007, the one year chart shows historical volatility in the
    5-10% range prior to the [Lehman Brothers](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/LEH)
    collapse last month. Historical volatility is now above 100% after a month and
    a half of pure chaos. As the chart below shows, PCY lost almost half of its value
    during the past month and appears to have bottomed last Friday. Note the new buying
    interest over the course of the last few days, as investors have sought out [emerging
    markets](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/emerging%20markets) debt
    as a value play.

    today’s global economy, from the credit crisis to the demand for [commodities](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/commodities)
    to the prospects for renewed global growth down the road. Keep an eye on PCY,
    not only as an indicator, but also for its investment potential.
