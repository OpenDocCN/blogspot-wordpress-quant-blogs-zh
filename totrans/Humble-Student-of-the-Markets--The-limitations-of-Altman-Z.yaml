- en: The original Altman Z score assigned fixed weights to each of the components.
    Different ranges for Altman Z score represented different levels of risk of bankruptcy.
    Subsequent versions of the formula varied the weights depending on whether the
    analyzed company is public or private and also varied the cutoff ranges for bankruptcy
    risk.

- en: The main problem with this formulation of solvency risk is that the formula
    is not suited for many industries. As an example, when I first tried to apply
    Altman Z I found that many regulated utilities showed up as having high bankruptcy
    risk.

- en: I found that Altman Z was not industry specific enough to my liking. For instance,
    low or negative working capital doesn’t score well on Altman Z but some industries
    can operate with zero or negative working capital. For example, a restaurant gets
    paid in cash, but their suppliers will generally give them net 30 on their payables
    and the inventory (food) turns over very quickly.

    does “sales” mean for a bank? Financials tend to be highly levered and their operating
    risks and exposures are not well disclosed.

    forecaster of solvency risk as it neutralizes many of the industry specific effects

    or relative real-time is not easy. It’s not hard to do after the fact, but at
    any one time, no one – not even the directors of the company really know what
    is embedded on the books at a financial. Société Générale, Barings, Northern Rock,
    Bear Stearns – the list of blowup surprises go on and on.

    economic times, a bank can produce earnings growth by growing its assets, or loan
    book. In the long run, not all banks can grow their loan books significantly in
    excess of GDP. High asset growth comes at a cost of lower asset quality.'

    of the standard ratio of loan loss provisions to total assets, I like to use loan

    get into trouble.'
