    interesting. The first is the monthly feature, *Fear and Loathing in October*,
    which examines seasonality from an anecdotal, statistical and a [behavioral finance](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/behavioral%20finance)
    perspective and puts the September through January period under the analytical
    microscope. Also of interest is the third and final installment in my series on
    the [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures) [term
    structure](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/term%20structure). *VIX
    Futures: Putting Ideas into Action* takes a six-part framework for analyzing VIX
    futures and discusses some of the implications for trading [VIX options](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20options)
    and [VIX ETNs](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20ETN) such as
    [VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX).'
