    – not I product I would normally have been excited about seeing. Having spent
    2hrs with a Microsoft Dynamics CRM Technical Solution the product does sound suitable
    for a number of financial specific problems. Interestingly, there is already a
    Dynamic CRM Financial Services web [page](http://www.microsoft.com/dynamics/industry/financialservices.mspx)
    together with a number of customer [case studies](http://www.microsoft.com/dynamics/casestudies/financialservices.aspx)
    – unfortunately none of these are tier-1 banks, but at least the list contains
    [ABN Amro](http://www.microsoft.com/dynamics/casestudies/financialservices.aspx?casestudyid=49265).
    On the product side, the .NET extendibility sounds promising as does the easy
    of configuration (web based). Obviously Outlook integration is [nice](http://www.microsoft.com/dynamics/crm/product/overview.mspx).
    Sensibly [4.0](http://blogs.msdn.com/mscrmfreak/archive/2007/10/04/microsoft-dynamics-crm-4-0-workflow.aspx)
    is going to have WF integrated – yes I was demo’d [4.0](http://blogs.msdn.com/usisvde/archive/2007/10/24/microsoft-dynamics-crm-4-0-latest-from-convergence-2007-copenhagen.aspx).

    to be adding [CRM](http://crm.microsoftdynamicslive.com/) to the cloud – wonder
    how this will impact [Salesforce](http://www.salesforce.com/)?
