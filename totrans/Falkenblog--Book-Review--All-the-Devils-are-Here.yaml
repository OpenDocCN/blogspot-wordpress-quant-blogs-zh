- en: This book focuses on how mortgage lenders, rating agencies, investment banks,
    regulators and government agencies started down the primrose path to the final
    mortgage madness in early 2007\. Most persons and institutions come off as petty,
    clueless or short-sighted, with ulterior motives masked by some public spiritness
    (‘financing the American Dream’). Many were clearly mistaken as geniuses during
    a long bull market (eg, CountryWide’s Angelo Mozillo won the American Banker's
    Lifetime Achievement Award in 2006). While the book tries to focus on a handful
    of leaders like heads of Fannie Mae, Ameriquest, Merril Lynch and others, I got
    the feeling none of these people were really necessary.

    not very hands on. The authors also mention Blythe Masters of JPMorgan, another
    Dilbertesque manager who really does not understand the products she is officially
    in charge of any more than Obama understands any of the myriad large institutions
    he officially ''runs''. Even ignoring this, the book makes it clear that everyone
    was ultimately chasing profits, trying to gain or just maintain market share.
    The prime mover was house prices. Given this upward trend the excesses are like
    detailing salacious happenings at a frat party: given a bunch of unsupervised
    young people and lots of alcohol the specifics are both irrelevant and inevitable.'

    a real powerhouses. The book notes an employee there saying "the same people who
    had power over you, whether they were congressional staffers or HUD employees
    or even members of Congress, wanted jobs and would unabashedly seek them." It
    was pretty clear that the regulators of Fannie and Freddie were puppets of the
    legislators who relied on the GSE perks, (Fannie spent $170 M on lobbying in the
    decade ending 2006). When legislators were about to rule on the GSEs they would
    get a "Fannie pack", which consists of every single loan originated in their district
    over the past 5 years. Republicans and Democrats loved this agency.

    governor Deval Patrick was hired as an Ameriquest Board member and received $360k
    per year for this 'job'. Yet, it paid off when he stepped in to help his old pal
    by placing a call to Robert Rubin, getting Citigroup to inject capital into Ameriquest
    in 2007, and he made some fruitful calls to Obama on behalf of Ameriquest's CEO
    as well.

- en: An interesting note is that some players did notice things were amiss in real
    time. In 2005, Greg Lipmann noted vastly higher default rates when home prices
    'only slightly' as opposed to in 'double digits', highlighting that unsustainable
    price appreciations were necessary to prevent a collapse in these mortgages. Andy
    Redleaf noted that in one presentation 85% of the mortgages were to take money
    out of a house ('cash-outs'), as opposed to buying a house. When he asked the
    company executive if these had different loss rates, the exec said he did not
    know, but presumed they were the same. This presumption, Redlief knew, was not
    innocuous, and supposing it so implied a massive amount of wishful thinking.

    one could have seen this all coming in real-time. Redleaf notes that it was not
    a handful of people who saw this coming--the theme of Michael Lewis, a great writer
    who is more often than not completely wrong on his main them--rather, there were
    about 50 hedge funds he knew of trying to short this stuff in 2006\. Now, I was
    not close to these asset classes, so when things fell apart in 2007, I had no
    idea that teaser-rate ARMs had grown from 31% to 70% over the prior 8 years, or
    that no-documentation loans were up from nothing to 30% by 2006\. Those kind of
    statistics were not highlighted in real time.

- en: Worse, loan originators appear to have been on a mission that could have only
    ended with massive failure. For example, one firm had to come up with a policy
    when silly loan applicants supplied information that was unnecessary under their
    ‘no doc’ lending program. The extra information actually made it harder to qualify,
    so they found a sneaky way to erase such information (eg, documentation of insufficient
    income). By 2006, loan standards were basically nonexistent and such a scenario
    was not going to end well.

    They do not bring in capital, they merely provide more prices, more markets. The
    authors suggest that the synthetic CDOs facilitated more lending, because investment
    banks could then hedge exposure they would not have taken. I’m skeptical that
    adding prices, and zero net capital, fueled the boom. Further, these markets really
    only grew in the final year and this catastrophe was decades in the making. Finally,
    the ABX index was one of the first mortgages prices to tank, and peremptorily
    shut down the mortgage secondary market by the end of the first quarter 2007,
    well before most banks shut off their lending programs (our US government is the
    only party unmoved by recent experience, dominating loans for under $300k).'

- en: Value-at-Risk is mentioned as if this had relevance, but I don't see how. VAR
    is a way to measure risk and subject to 'garbage in-garbage out'. The garbage
    in was the assumption that home prices, nationally, would not decline. Given that
    assumption, there is little risk. This isn't abstruse math, it's something my
    stupidest relative would understand. It is not, nor has it ever been, applicable
    to an entire firm including many held to maturity portfolios (ie, portfolios without
    market prices). I worked with VAR when it first came out, and we applied it at
    KeyCorp, to about 1% of our equity risk capital. For investment banks this number
    is higher, but it’s still small, hardly the sorcerer’s apprentice-type tool that
    had any effect.

- en: Several times there is a suggestion that a few regulators were thwarted in their
    attempts to control the market--Shiela Blaire at the FDIC, Brooksley Born at CFTC--but
    there's no evidence that any of their little attempts to gain more regulatory
    control would have mattered. First, they often had only vague objectives to ‘look
    at’ various questions, or have the CFTC monitor something instead of the OTS.
    Secondly, its not as if synthetic CDOs traded on an exchange would have necessarily
    prevented this problem. Lastly, it is not as if firms regulated by the OFHEO,
    OTS, OCC, the Fed, had significantly different behavior. Lending to people who
    could not afford it served many objectives and had many constituencies, and so
    the bottom line, that underwriting criteria weakened more and more until the end
    when underwriting criteria basically did not exist. The key was, given the top-down
    directive towards increasing home ownership, especially among the poor, this implied
    weaker lending standards. While later they claimed 'no one made banks lend to
    people who could not pay', while technically true, it was also true that regulators
    did nothing to discourage such lending and plenty to encourage it. 'Not force'
    does not imply 'discourage'.

- en: The criticism of the rating agencies I found rather funny. They note as a critique
    there were 'many instances when [the rating agencies] got it wrong, usually when
    something unexpected happened.' Did they expect the rating agencies to predict
    these unexpected events? Let me know when you figure that out. To recap, rating
    agencies generally give the market a slightly independent view of 'quality' that
    is also highly informed by the market. If something trades in the market at prices
    consistent with a B rating, it will not have a AAA rating, and vice versa. Rating
    agencies do not differ from the markets for very long. However, they also do not
    simply ape the markets, which is why they lag them. If you think ratings are 'totally
    wrong', then it should be pretty easy to create arbitrage in credit markets because
    prices and ratings are generally consistent, and this is not so easy. However,
    it would be folly to defer one's credit analysis to the rating agencies if you
    have, say, over $100MM to invest. Like everyone else presented, the rating agencies
    were drinking the ‘home lending’ Kool Aid.

    somehow, as if the homes bought with fraudulent statements, teaser interest rates,
    and no money down, was something they truly owned. The authors note 'these mortgages
    weren't bought, they were sold'. No, they were bought too. This only worked because
    borrowers were getting cheap if not free options on home prices, and these options
    paid off handsomely in the decade prior to 2008\. They enjoyed cashing money out
    of homes throughout the housing bubble, and those stories facilitated more willing
    victims who were just as greedy and short-sighted as investors. The under capitalized
    home owner lost less capital than anyone in this fiasco, so I don't see them as
    the 'losers' in this game.

    ephemeral increase in homeownership was to people who never had the wherewithal
    or commitment to own homes, rather, the boom merely gave all sorts of people money
    they basically wasted. This highlights the folly of trying to fine-tune aggregate
    economic statistics, as homeownership is something you can have ‘too much’ of,
    as inconceivable as that might sound to some back in 2005\. [Today we can’t have
    enough education.]

- en: The key to a bubble is the broad asset class trend that facilitates it. This
    highlights why interviews on CNBC are so clichéd and vapid. I mean, really successful
    people seem nice enough, usually have virtues like discipline, good humor, and
    above average intelligence, but once they stop talking about their childhood (who
    didn't have interesting challenges growing up?), their big idea is often just
    to go all-in on a big trend that works. A really big bet like that that pays off
    can't be luck, many people think, because that would be an absurd amount of risk.
    This just highlights the maxim about confusing a genius with a bull market. It
    happens all the time.
