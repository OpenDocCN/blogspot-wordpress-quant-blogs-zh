# Magmasystems Blog: Help Wanted for the Complex Event Processing Project

> 来源：[http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2007/11/help-wanted-for-complex-event.html#0001-01-01](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2007/11/help-wanted-for-complex-event.html#0001-01-01)

I have open headcount for about 4 or 5 people for 2008 for the Complex Event Processing project that I am running.

I realize that it is foolhardy to advertise for people who have prior experience in

CEP

. What I am looking for are smart developers who have a great passion to learn a new, interesting technology. The team that I envision will consist of:

1) Visualization developer - come up with new, interesting ways to visual events and data. The work may entail working with the .NET framework that my team has built, integrating visualizations with existing Java/Swing-based trader

GUIs

, or even exploring

WPF

(as the company gradually embraced .NET 3.x). You could be investigating visualization tools like

heatmaps

and you will definitely be evaluating third-party tools (both commercial and open-source). You will be involved in

OLAP

to some extent. There will be involvement in the building out of a notification and alerting framework.

2)

CEP

developer. You will be building out the analysis part inside the

CEP

engine. Most of the

CEP

engines use a

variant

of

SQL

, so you should be fairly comfortable with

SQL

concepts. It would be nice if you had previous experience with tools like Coral8,

Aleri

,

Streambase

,

Esper

, etc, but even if you haven't, you should be willing to learn these tools. You may also be interacting with consultants from these companies.

3) Networking, messaging, and market data specialist. Help us decide if we should migrate to a new messaging infrastructure (like

RTI

or 29West). Experience with

Tibco

EMS is a big plus, as well as experience with working with high volumes of data and low latency. Interact with Reuters and Wombat infrastructures, as well as internally-built market data infrastructures.

4) Data specialist. You will be the person who is

responsible

for breaking down silos and getting good data into the

CEP

engine. Experience with

SQL

Server 2005 and

Sybase

are important. Experience with tick databases like

KDB

+ and

Vhayu

would be nice to have.

Everyone will be doing a bit of everything, so everyone on this team will be intimately aware of what everyone else is doing.

This is a highly-visible position in an investment bank that has promised me that they will reward good talent who comes to us from the outside.

In addition to the positions mentioned above, I have two or three open headcount for people who want to work on the

Ventana

team.

Ventana

is the client-side .NET framework that is being used by various groups in our Investment Bank.
