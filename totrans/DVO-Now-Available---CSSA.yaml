- en: The DVO which stands for the DV Oscillator is the mother indicator of the DV2
    and DVSC. The DVO did nearly 40% CAGR on the SPY over the last 12 years just using
    a simple baseline strategy of entering below 50 and exiting above 50.  It is much
    more adaptive than  DV2 or DVSC and the frequency of the oscillator swings are
    less sensitive to regime changes. The average gains per trade are much higher
    with the DVO than the DV2 or the DVSC . It is available now at [www.dvindicators.com](http://www.dvindicators.com)
