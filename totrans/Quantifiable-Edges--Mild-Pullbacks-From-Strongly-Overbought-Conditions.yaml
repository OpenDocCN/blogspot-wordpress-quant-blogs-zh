    of the bounce is meek. Most of the time to get a strong multi-day move off a low,
    you need a convincing day-1 bounce. Tonight I decided to flip this concept on
    its head a little bit and examine what happens after a small pullback day during
    a strong upmove. For this study I used the 2-day RSI. The 2-day RSI is a very
    sensitive indicator so it would take a very small decline from a very overbought
    position in order for it to remain above 90 on a down day. This is what happened
    on Thursday and what I examined below.

    on these results. The edge pretty much plays itself out within the first two days
    though. Looking further out in time did not showing significant results.
