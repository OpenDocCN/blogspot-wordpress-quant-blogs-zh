    variant of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19\. The variant harbours a large
    number of mutations found in other variants, including Delta, and it seems to
    be spreading quickly across South Africa.

    first identified in Botswana this month and has turned up in travellers to Hong
    Kong from South Africa. Scientists are also trying to understand the variant’s
    properties, such as whether it can evade immune responses triggered by vaccines
    and whether it causes more or less severe disease than other variants do.'

    to dodge immunity from vaccines and previous infections. There are anecdotal reports
    of reinfections and cases in vaccinated individuals, but “at this stage it’s too
    early to tell anything,” Moore adds.

    the work to understand the significance of this variant and what it means for
