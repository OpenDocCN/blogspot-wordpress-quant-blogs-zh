    indicator had risen above the 58.1% level where it stood yesterday. Each instance
    would have been an opportunistic time to be long.

    oversold, short-covering rallies it didn’t seem particularly viscous. Below is
    a comparison of how it fared against the first day bounce the other 4 times the

    or better. Below 3% and the results were sketchy. There appears to be a slight
    upside edge 5 days out, and slight downside edges 10 and 15 days out.

    The market was certainly oversold enough that it could put in a rally over the
    next few days and weeks, but today’s start was not impressive.
