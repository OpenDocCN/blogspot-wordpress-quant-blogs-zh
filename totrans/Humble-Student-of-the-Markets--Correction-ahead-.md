# Humble Student of the Markets: Correction ahead?

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2020/02/correction-ahead.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2020/02/correction-ahead.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models**

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post,

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The

**Trend Asset Allocation Model**

is an asset allocation model which applies trend following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or contraction (bearish)?"

My inner trader uses a

**trading model**

, which is a blend of price momentum (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa). Subscribers receive real-time alerts of model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of the those email alerts are updated weekly

. The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that began in March 2016 is shown below.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Buy equities*
*   Trend Model signal: Neutral*
*   Trading model: Bullish*

** The performance chart and model readings have been delayed by a week out of respect to our paying subscribers.* **Update schedule**

: I generally update model readings on my

.

**A downside break?**

Is this the start of a correction? I made the point in the past (see

[Why the market is rallying on fear - Yes, Fear!](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2020/02/12/why-the-market-is-rallying-on-fear-yes-fear/)

) that USD assets were rising because foreigners were piling in because the US is the last safe haven. That was why US equities, bonds, and the USD were rising in concert. The equity market began to decouple late last week from bond prices, which are the possible signs of a downside break, but the conclusion is not definitive.
