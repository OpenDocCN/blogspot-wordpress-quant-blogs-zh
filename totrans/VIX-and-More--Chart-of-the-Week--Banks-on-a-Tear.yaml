- en: There were many cross-currents in the financial markets during the last week,
    but one of the dominant themes was the spike in Treasury yields. As expectations
    for interest rates move higher, the banks are also catching a bid. Long able to
    borrow at Bernanke-induced artificially low rates, now banks are finding better
    prospects on the lending side – and have the added bonus of a larger yield spread
    on their loans as interest rates start to climb.

    In the graphic below, note that the upper study shows banks have been consistently
    underperforming the S&P 500 index for the past seven months. In the last week,
    however, banks have shown a dramatic turnaround that has lifted [KBE](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/KBE),
    the popular bank ETF, above resistance (dotted blue line) and also reversed the
    trend of outperforming the broader market.

    in the performance of the broader market in 2011\. Said another way, banks will
    continue to be a critical barometer not just of global growth, but of the ability
    of various economies to deal with threats to growth, such as sovereign debt and
    other issues.
