- en: '**Mid-week market update**: I have been calling for a period of consolidation
    and pullback and that phase of the market seems to have arrived. As the S&P 500
    weakened and the VIX Index spiked above its upper Bollinger Band, indicating a
    short-term oversold condition, this stock market has been remarkably resilient.
    The 5-day RSI traced out a positive divergence, and the NYSE net new highs remained
    positive during this episode.'
