- en: The market has seen a lot of finishes near the top of its daily range lately.
     When the market consistently closes near the high of the day it suggests optimism
    on the part of traders. This end-of-day optimism is now at a level that suggests
    it is overdone and there is a good chance of a pullback. The study below was last
    seen in the 1/16/13 blog and it exemplifies this concept. I have updated all of
    the statistics.

    the edge has been realized over the 1st 2 days.  Below is an equity curve showing
    how the edge has played out using a 2-day exit strategy.

    of the last few instances.

- en: '*Note: To calculate the “8-day Average Closing % Range” I am simply measuring
    where in the daily range SPY closed each day. For instance if it traded at a low
    of $146.00 and a high of $147.00 and closed at $146.75, then it would have closed
    in the 75th percentile of the daily range. A close at $146.50 would have meant
    50%.**I then take a simple moving average of the last 8 days. If that average
    goes from below 75% (where it usually is) to above 75%, the study is triggered.*'
