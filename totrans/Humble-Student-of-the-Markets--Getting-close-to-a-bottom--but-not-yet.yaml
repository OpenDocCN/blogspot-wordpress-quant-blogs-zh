    powerful from a financial conditions perspective.*** Banks are actually outperforming
    in the sell-off, and liquidity indicators are well behaved. For example, dollar
    funding markets are stable, and short-duration credit instruments are holding
    firm, while the move in swap spreads has been moderate (relative to VIX moves).
    Hence, while high yield spreads are meaningfully wider (from a low base), it is
    not clear at this point that there will be strong feedback into the economy through
    tighter credit conditions. In fact, in the US, you can argue that lower mortgage
    rates will be a boost to an important component of the credit spectrum.
