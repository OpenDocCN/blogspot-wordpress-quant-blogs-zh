- en: The task of issuing buy and sell recommendations have also been computerized
    for years. It's called quantitative investing, but differs from fundamental investing
    in a key way. Typical quantitative investing techniques rely on factors, such
    as the insight that "low P/E stocks tend to beat the market". So what you do is
    buy a whole bunch of low P/E stocks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Where quantitative investing differs from the kind of fundamental investing
    done by company analysts is the degree of confidence in the forecast. Quants tend
    to take a statistical approach and buy a large and broad portfolio of low P/E
    names, whereas a company specific fundamental analyst will have a far higher level
    of confidence in his forecast.

    which has had an impressive multi-decade track record, and ranks stocks with Timeliness
    rankings of 1 (best) to 5 (worst). Does that count as a robot replacement? (Yes,
    I know that Value Line has human analysts, but not all ranking systems do and
    I use Value Line purely as an example of a quantitatively driven buy-hold-sell
    system.)

- en: Let me give you an example. Early in my career, I had the privilege to work
    with a small cap analyst who went on to be a portfolio manager and now the co-head
    of equities of a major asset management firm. From watching what "Doug" did, I
    gained invaluable insights that made me a much better quant later in my own career.
    Small cap analysis is different from being an industry analyst because the drivers
    for each company and industry are different. When he picked up coverage of a company,
    Doug would spend several weeks chasing down what he believed the important drivers
    of value for a company by speaking to the company, its competitors, suppliers,
    customers and industry association. He would often waste days and weeks chasing
    down blind alleys only to discover that the issue that he was researching was
    irrelevant. Only once he had developed a framework for understanding how the business
    worked would he actually build the spreadsheet for valuing the company`s shares.

    templates. Perhaps smart software might have been able to read financial statement
    footnotes to figure out the kinds of risks that Enron had been taking, as the
    Street seemed oblivious. Can software do channel checks to gain insights as to
    the public perception of a new product launch, maybe. Those levels of sophistication
    are probably one or two generations ahead - for now.

    analysts may have different insights that institutional investors find valuable
    and will pay for. As an example, I recall that as a portfolio manager, I derived
    different levels of understanding of tech darling Nokia during the late 1990's
    from different analysts.

- en: The American analysts were much better at business strategy. Nokia was the dominant
    producer of cellphones and had enormous economies of scale advantages to their
    then rivals like Motorola, Ericsson, Samsung and others. Nokia's handset operating
    margins were in the high teens whereas the margins of their best competitors were
    in either high single digits or low teens. That, reasoned many US analysts, was
    a source of competitive advantage for Nokia and what made the stock a buy.

    of the success (or failure) of new handset models rolled out by the major European
    handset makers. That kind of channel check insight was also a source of tactical
    advantage. In effect, I read research from the American brokers for the big picture
    and spoke to the local European brokers because they knew where all the bodies
    were buried.

    the real analytical insight comes from.
