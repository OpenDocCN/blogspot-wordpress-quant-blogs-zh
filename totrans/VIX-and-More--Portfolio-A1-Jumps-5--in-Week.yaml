    strong week puts Portfolio A1’s cumulative return back into the plus column, with
    gains since the February 16^(th) inception now at 1.8%.  While this performance
    continues to trail the 4.9% gain registered by the benchmark S&P 500 index during
    the same period, an optimist might venture a small smile for the first time in

    this portfolio may provide yet another interesting competition between man and
