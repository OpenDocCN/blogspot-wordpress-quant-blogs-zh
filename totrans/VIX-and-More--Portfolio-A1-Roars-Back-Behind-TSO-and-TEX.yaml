- en: After two weeks of losing ground to the benchmark S&P 500 index, Portfolio A1
    roared back last week, with all five stocks in the green.  The strong performance
    was led by a 6.4% gain from newcomer [Tesoro (TSO)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=tso&hl=en)
    and a 6.3% gain in portfolio leader [Terex (TEX)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=tex&hl=en),
    which is now up over 29% in just 3 ½ months.  The gains in TSO are particularly
    gratifying, as they allow me to get my hopes up that the fifth and final holding
    in the portfolio may now begin to add value rather than destroy it, as has generally
    been the case so far.

    on the S&P 500.  This is below the year’s best 6.77% advantage from April 29^(th),
    but at least is heading in the right direction once again.

    during the week.
