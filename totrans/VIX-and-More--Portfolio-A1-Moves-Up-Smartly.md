# VIX and More: Portfolio A1 Moves Up Smartly

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/12/portfolio-a1-moves-up-smarty.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/12/portfolio-a1-moves-up-smarty.html#0001-01-01)

It was a very good week for Portfolio A1 – and an excellent week for the portfolio’s top three holdings.  With [Mosaic (MOS)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=mos) gaining 13.4%, [Sinopec (SNP)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=snp) up 13.7%. and [DryShips (DRYS)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=drys) surging 22.8%, it is not surprising that the full portfolio tacked on 10.6% in a remarkable week.

With less than a month to go in the trading year, Portfolio A1’s cumulative 12.2% gain is 10.4% better than the meager 1.8% gain in the benchmark S&P 500 index.

Despite the recent success, the portfolio is not standing pat, as beverage company [PepsiAmericas (PAS)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=pas) is being swapped out for [Fresh Del Monte Produce (FDP)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=fdp) in a move that I cannot attempt to explain.  As fun as it has been watching and commenting on the doings of this mechanical portfolio, I am looking forward to rolling out a discretionary portfolio at the beginning of the new year.

There are no other changes to the portfolio this week.

A snapshot of the portfolio is as follows:
