- en: It’s remarkable how swiftly the consensus narrative can change. Two weeks ago,
    the 2-year Treasury yield spike above 5% when the ADP Non-farm Employment report
    came in at a blowout 497K, which was well ahead of expectations of 228K. The news
    prompted speculation that the Fed would have to tighten more than expected and
    send the economy into recession.

- en: Last week, the softer-than-expected CPI report abruptly shifted the tone of
    the consensus to a soft landing and sparked a risk-on rally in risk assets and
    yields retreated. This matters because the 2-year Treasury yield is a proxy for
    market expectations of the Fed Funds rate. Past peaks in the 2-year rate have
    either been coincidental or led peaks in Fed Funds.

    If the narrative can flip from bear to bull in a week, it may not take much for
    it to flip back. The market is at a critical juncture. Team Soft Landing is locked
    in a cage match with Team Slowdown. Who wins?
