  zh: A fragile consensus
- en: It’s remarkable how swiftly the consensus narrative can change. Two weeks ago,
    the 2-year Treasury yield spike above 5% when the ADP Non-farm Employment report
    came in at a blowout 497K, which was well ahead of expectations of 228K. The news
    prompted speculation that the Fed would have to tighten more than expected and
    send the economy into recession.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 共识故事的转变速度之快令人瞩目。两周前，当ADP非农就业报告以惊人的497K发布时，两年期国债收益率一度超过5%，远超预期的228K。这一消息促使人们猜测，美联储将不得不比预期更多地收紧政策，并将经济推入衰退。
- en: Last week, the softer-than-expected CPI report abruptly shifted the tone of
    the consensus to a soft landing and sparked a risk-on rally in risk assets and
    yields retreated. This matters because the 2-year Treasury yield is a proxy for
    market expectations of the Fed Funds rate. Past peaks in the 2-year rate have
    either been coincidental or led peaks in Fed Funds.

  zh: 上周，比预期更为温和的CPI报告突然改变了市场的共识，转为软着陆，并引发了风险资产的上涨和收益率的下降。这很重要，因为两年期国债收益率是市场对联邦基金利率预期的代理。两年期利率过去的峰值要么是巧合，要么导致了联邦基金利率的峰值。
- en: The current environment illustrates the fragile nature of the market consensus.
    If the narrative can flip from bear to bull in a week, it may not take much for
    it to flip back. The market is at a critical juncture. Team Soft Landing is locked
    in a cage match with Team Slowdown. Who wins?

  zh: 当前环境展示了市场共识的脆弱性质。如果叙事可以从熊市转为牛市只需一周，那么它可能很容易再次反转。市场正处于一个关键的转折点。软着陆团队正在与放缓团队进行一场激烈的较量。谁会赢？
