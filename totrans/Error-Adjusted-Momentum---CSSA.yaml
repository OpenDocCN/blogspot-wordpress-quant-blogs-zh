    "VIX-Adjusted Momentum") I introduced a method to normalize returns using the
    VIX to improve upon a standard momentum or trend-following strategy. There are
    many possible extensions of this idea, and I would encourage readers to look at
    one of the comments in the previous post which may inspire some new ideas. The
    motivation for this method was to provide an alternative approach that is more
    broadly applicable to other assets than a VIX-based strategy (which is more appropriate
    for equities). This method uses the standard error of the mean to adjust returns
    instead of using the VIX, which is a proxy for market noise. The logic is that
    returns should be weighted more when predictability is high, and conversely weighted
    less when predictability is low. In this case, the error-adjusted moving average
    will hopefully be more robust to market noise than a standard moving average.
    To calculate the standard error, I used the 10-day average return to generate
    a forecast, and then took the 10-day mean absolute error of the forecast. To normalize
    returns, I divide each return by this standard error estimate prior to taking
    a 200-day average of the re-scaled returns. The rules for the ER-MOM strategy
    are the same as in the last post (although poorly articulated):'

- en: The error-adjusted momentum strategy has the best returns and risk-adjusted
    returns- edging out the previous method that used the VIX. In either case, both
    adjusted momentum strategies performed better than their standard counterparts.
    One concept to note is that the benefit or edge of the adjusted momentum strategies
    tends to be more significant at longer trend-following lookbacks. This makes sense
    because there are likely to be a wider range of variance regimes throughout a
    long stretch of time than over a shorter lookback. Adjusting for these different
    variance regimes gives a clearer picture of the long-term trend. Using the historical
    standard deviation is also a viable alternative to either using the standard error
    or the VIX, and there are a lot of other ways to measure variability/noise that
    can be used as well.
