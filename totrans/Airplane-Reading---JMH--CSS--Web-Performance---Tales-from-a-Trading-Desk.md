## Airplane Reading – JMH, CSS, Web Performance

Apart from the usual workload, the one advantage to flights is that you get time to read a degree of the bookmarked articles you’ve been trying to read for n amount of time.  Here’s my list from last night:

*   Writing Java Micro Benchmarks with JMH: [Juicy](http://psy-lob-saw.blogspot.co.uk/2013/04/writing-java-micro-benchmarks-with-jmh.html)
*   Know Thy Java Object Memory [Layout](http://psy-lob-saw.blogspot.co.uk/2013/05/know-thy-java-object-memory-layout.html)
*   Using JMH to Benchmark Multi-Threaded [Code](http://psy-lob-saw.blogspot.co.uk/2013/05/using-jmh-to-benchmark-multi-threaded.html)
*   CSS [Architecture](http://engineering.appfolio.com/2012/11/16/css-architecture/) – probably worth a ready by anyone building an enterprise CSS project
*   Scrolling [Performance](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/speed/scrolling/)
*   CSS Paint Times and Page [Render](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/speed/css-paint-times/) Weight
