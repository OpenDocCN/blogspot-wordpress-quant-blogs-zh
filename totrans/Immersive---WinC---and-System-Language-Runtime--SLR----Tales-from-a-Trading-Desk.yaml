    starting at Microsoft as a Distinguished Engineer (August 2011), is C++ the new
    Microsoft language? The various [speculative](http://channel9.msdn.com/Forums/Coffeehouse/My-prediction-for-the-NET-Windows-8-dev-story-based-on-leaks)
    postings in the SLR don’t really provide a clear view as to what Microsoft is
    thinking. We already know from the various MS Research projects that they are
    been looking at managed OS’s in some detail. It’s a shame that there was no .NET
    [information](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/windows-8-more-than-just-windows-phone-on-your-pc/9592)
    around Win8 at the recent conferences, and that we’re now waiting from the September
    2011 Build conference in the hope of getting some clarity.

    Apple knocked Microsoft so badly off its game? Didn’t Microsoft learn anything
    from the last information nightmare around HTML5 and Silverlight?

    applications, could the SLR be part of Jupiter?

    applications using a XAML-based approach with coming tools from Microsoft.'

    the current Win8 [builds](http://forums.mydigitallife.info/threads/26404-Windows-8-%287955%29-Findings-in-M3-Leak?p=441473&viewfull=1#post441473),

    [opportunity](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/what-is-winc-and-how-does-it-figure-in-microsofts-bid-to-make-tools-a-2-billion-business/9359),
    but in the (financial) corporate space with the current Windows 7 roll-out still
    underway (or not started) we’re not going to get Windows 8 “coolness” for a number
    of years.
