    There are benefits to gun ownership, just as there are benefits to owning a car.
    Were readers upset that I pointed out that there are risks to gun ownership? Guns
    are, by definition, dangerous - they are designed to kill and having a weapon
    in your house and possession raise your risk level, just as owning a car is risker
    (you can run over people with it). The debate is over whether the benefits outweigh
    the risks.

    the "get the government off my back" variety and, at the same time, the NRA's
    called on the federal government to station police officers in every school in
    the country.

    for more government? How about deploying elements of the 101st Airborne or 4th
    Mountain in schools? Wouldn't that deter the "bad" guys even more?

    better government", then there is a better way forward - let the market do it.

    qualified could be allowed to own a gun. Just as car ownerships are required to
    have insurance, gun owner should be required to carry a large level of liability
    insurance in case the guns under his control are used improperly.

    Insurance companies are in the business of pricing risk and they should be able
    to price the cost of gun ownership properly. That way, the market can create barriers
    to the "crazies" owning guns.

    the "right kind" of gun ownership, i.e. responsible ones, will be largely unaffected.
    In America, everyone who is qualified is allowed to own a car, but not everyone
    is owns one because of the costs involved. Under this proposal, the free market
    would tend to weed out the higher risk cases.

    be an important step in the application of this principle pertaining to the gun
    ownership and control debate.
