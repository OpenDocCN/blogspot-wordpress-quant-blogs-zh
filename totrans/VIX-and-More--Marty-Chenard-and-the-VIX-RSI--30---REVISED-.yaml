    has an excellent stable of charts that he uses as a jumping off point to analyze
    the markets. Every trading day he has a [new free chart](http://www.stocktiming.com/Stock-Market-Daily-Analysis.htm)
    and once a week or so he manages to work the VIX and volatility into the conversation.

    each week as they are replaced by new ones, but [Headline Charts](http://headlinecharts.blog.com/)
    recently captured one of Chenard’s VIX ideas in a post. Headline Charts [maintains](http://headlinecharts.blog.com/4561403/)
    that according to Chenard, markets do not advance on the basis of a declining
    VIX alone, but also require that the declining VIX transpire in the context of
    a VIX with an [RSI](http://www.stockcharts.org/help/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:relative_strength_in)
    (30) above the 50 line.

    Headline Charts, one can see that the VIX has spent very little time above the
    50 line for the RSI (30) during the course of the past six months? Could this
    be part of the reason why the markets have had such difficulty putting together
    a convincing rally?

    RSI theory. Without crunching any numbers, visual inspection already has me skeptical
    about the advisability of waiting for a declining VIX with an RSI above 50\. I
    have highlighted four significant bull moves in which there was a declining VIX
    and an RSI (30) below 50.

    I have difficulty finding support for Chenard’s VIX RSI market timing approach.

    my reading comprehension a nudge and for giving me an opportunity to have my own
    [Emily Litella](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Litella) moment. In rereading
    the Headline Charts piece, I am now persuaded that Chenard was talking about the
    RSI (30) of the SPX instead of the VIX. This makes a lot more sense to me and
    shows much more favorably on the charts. Here is a similar chart to the one above,
    with the RSI (30) for the SPX instead of the VIX. Now I like his theory a lot
    better…
