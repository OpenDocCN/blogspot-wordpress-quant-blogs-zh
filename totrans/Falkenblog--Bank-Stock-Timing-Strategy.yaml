    vega zone: the potential for getting stopped out makes them want to avoid risks,
    not take them. For fun, I looked at a trading implication, based on the idea that
    I alone, via my theory, know when banks will be timid or growing.  A timid bank
    doesn''t make money, so it''s best to avoid it then. It''s not short term enough
    for it to be really useful, so I''m sharing, and I think all investors thinking
    about their bank index allocation should find this interesting.'

    SP500 when this correlation is high in absolute terms (very negative, all correlations
    with the changes in the VIX are negative), I don't want to invest, because the
    banks won't be investing and making money. In the 50% of the time that correlation
    is low (again, in absolute value), I'm in the banks. Here's a comparison of that
    strategy, and clearly timing based on the bank-VIX change correlation outperforms
    simply being always long banks.

    putting a median in there.

- en: We are currently at -70% for a correlation, still bad for banks (median around
    -62%). This is all out of sample, and a pretty simple rule. I did try this with
    Ken French's other industries, and found no similar pattern.
