    (HV) and [implied volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/implied%20volatility)
    (IV). I tend to place slightly more emphasis on implied volatility because implied
    volatility looks to the future, is derived from options prices, and can provide
    some clues about the current sentiment of options investors. Of course, the CBOE
    Volatility Index, commonly known as the VIX, is an index that measures implied
    volatility in S&P 500 index options, so that may persuade me to favor IV over
    HV a little as well.'

    simple concept. It looks backward at price action and measures the degree of change
    in the price of a security. Things get a little more complicated, however, when
    one asks two seemingly innocuous questions:'

- en: The issue of a lookback period is really not much of a complication, but it
    does lead to a proliferation of historical volatility numbers. As historical volatility
    looks only at trading days, it is important to note that the historical volatility
    calendar differs from the implied volatility calendar. As a result, the standard
    implied volatility [time horizon](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/time%20horizon)
    of 30 (calendar) days (such as is used by the VIX) translates to about 21 trading
    days, assuming the usual NYSE nine holidays per year. Even with the different
    calendars, the most frequently used historical volatility measurement is HV 30,
    which translates to about 43 calendar days.

- en: The appropriate lookback period to use for historical volatility calculations
    is ultimately a matter of personal taste. As noted above, most providers of HV
    data tend to standardize on HV 30, but I generally prefer HV 20 or HV 21, as this
    is a better approximation of a trading month. One can use shorter time frames,
    but investors should be wary of the amount of noise in calculations that look
    back less than 20 days. Still, I like to look at HV 10 to get a sense of the most
    recent volatility trend. Looking farther out, HV 50 or HV 60 are popular ways
    to capture almost an entire earnings cycle, while HV 90, HV 100, HV 180 and HV
    200 are all excellent ways to capture the long-term volatility trend. In order
    to incorporate a full year of historical volatility, HV 250 is recommended. Some
    options traders like to look at two full years of historical volatility data with
    the likes of HV 500, but I rarely find much value looking back a second year unless
    – as is the case right now – the most recent year is filled with quite a few statistical
    outliers.

    built in, but HV data is also available from various options service providers
    such as [Livevol](http://www.livevol.com/) or [iVolatility](http://www.ivolatility.com/).

- en: Note that standard historical volatility data are the result of a calculation
    involving close-to-close prices, specifically end of day prices. As such, historical
    volatility does not capture the magnitude of any intraday price movements, which
    are better served by calculations such as an [average true range](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/average%20true%20range).

- en: Finally, while there are many ways to calculate historical volatility, by convention
    historical volatility is calculated by taking the standard deviation of the difference
    between the natural log of the daily changes in the price of the underlying and
    the mean value during the lookback period. This sounds a lot uglier than it turns
    out to be in Excel. Since this is the holiday season, however, tomorrow I will
    provide a recipe for the traditional historical volatility calculation as well
    as a modification that I find simpler and more useful.
