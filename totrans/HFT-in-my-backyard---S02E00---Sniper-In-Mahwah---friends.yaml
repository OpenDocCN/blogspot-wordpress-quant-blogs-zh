    statement by [@MarcosCarreira](https://twitter.com/MarcosCarreira), made in his [review](http://mcarreira.typepad.com/mc_notes/2016/12/market-microstructure-paris-2016-part-2.html) of
    the last [Market Microstructure – Confronting Many Viewpoints](http://market-microstructure.institutlouisbachelier.org/Program.aspx?lng=EN#.WFFU_3dMCEJ) organized
    in Paris two weeks ago. As I attended the conference two years ago (I even gave
    a little speech at the speakers’ dinner, I was honored to be invited to talk about “market
    microstructure in the Middle Ages” – this year the speakers’ dinner speech was
    by [Donald MacKenzie](http://www.sps.ed.ac.uk/staff/sociology/mackenzie_donald)),
    I came back in the French capital for two days to listen to some interesting (but
    a little bit complex) talks about “Instability from Information Efficiency” or
    “High-Frequency Trading and Extreme Price Movements” or “Dissecting Cross-Impact
    on Stock Markets: An Empirical Analysis” and so on. If you like finance, market
    structure and mathematics, this conference is *the place to be*; if you don’t
    get the extra-long mathematical formulas (like me), this is the place to be too
    since there are opportunities to meet people involved in the market (structure)
    industry (read Marcos’ [review](http://mcarreira.typepad.com/mc_notes/2016/12/market-microstructure-paris-2016-part-2.html) to
    learn more about what happened in Paris this year).'

    McKay Brothers’ CEO Stéphane Tyc (one of the best players in the HFT “arm race”)
    and Eric Budish (an academic from Chicago who wants to slow down the market with [auctions](https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/eric.budish/research/HFT-FrequentBatchAuctions.pdf))
    – the two obviously totally disagree on HF, but the chat was quite challenging.
    This year I met Sebastian, who works for Deutsche Börse/Eurex as an engineer,
    in charge of the matching engine of the exchanges (the matching engines are like
    the old pits: a place where buyers and sellers meet, collocated as close as possible to
    the engine). It’s always good to see the face behind a Twitter account. We had
    a lunch and discussed about the design of such engines – to me the main issue
    here is information dissemination: when a trades occur, most often the buyer and
    the seller know about the trade (sometimes far) before the transaction is publicly
    disseminated to the other participants. It seems like Eurex want to reduce this gap
    (check out this technical [document](http://www.eurexchange.com/blob/238346/5e2ce06990dd2a2e108fd2030dfcf5a2/data/presentation_insights-into-trading-system-dynamics_en.pdf)). (This
    issue is not a small one: I recently learnt that because of a software upgrade,
    an exchange having a matching engine in UK allow the buyer and the seller involved
    in a trade to know about it *70 microseconds* before the other participants, and
    this is a lot, such a thing should not exist). Sebastian also introduced me to two
    of his colleagues who work for the CME Group, on the matching engines (it seems
    like they were in Paris quite incognito), so the next day I had a lunch with three guys
    with whom I had the opportunity to know more about the way they design this critical
    and technical piece at the center of capitalism – the matching engine). Very interesting.
    Nice guys, nice lunch.'

    (one more time) how serious is the problem of data. Lots of academics complain
    because they can’t get recent data from the exchanges (given the scandalous amounts
    of money the exchanges earn by selling data to the ones who generate it, they
    obviously don’t offer it *for free* to other people); we even joked about the
    fact some academics still rely on a (now un)famous data set from Nasdaq, for the
    years 2008 and 2009, to analyze HFT activity (this is a non sense). The very good
    news is (at least this is their personal view) they are willing to give more data
    to the academics (“we’ll see what we can do in terms of better providing data
    sets to academics and guidance on how to use them”). Hurray. The most important
    would be to get data from *more than one exchange*, as it’s nearly impossible
    to learn about what’s going on in the markets with data coming from one venue
    (a trader may remove liquidity here and add liquidity there, etc.). Data is everything,
    for both the traders and the academics.'

    the English title would be *Imaginary numbers in Geometry*: *Les Imaginaires en
    géométrie. Extension du domaine des images géométriques à deux dimensions (Essai
    d’une nouvelle concrétisation des imaginaires)* by Pavel Florensky (1882-1937).
    Florensky was quite a fascinating Russian mathematician and an Orthodox priest
    (check out [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavel_Florensky)) who wrote the
    most part of this book when he was studying mathematics in Moscow, but the last
    part was done 20 years later when Moscow celebrated the five hundredth anniversary
    of Italian poet Dante’s death. The book is full of mathematical formulas I don’t
    understand, but in short, as Wiki rightly pointed out, “it’s devoted to the geometrical
    interpretation of Albert Einstein’s theory of relativity. Among other things,
    he proclaimed that the geometry of imaginary numbers predicted by the theory of
    relativity for a body moving faster than light is the geometry of the Kingdom
    of God. For mentioning the Kingdom of God in that work, he was accused of agitation
    by Soviet authorities.” – this is worst: this book was one of the reasons Florensky
    was sent to a gulag, where he lived for years before being executed with a single
    bullet to the head. A sad story.'

    of the book is by mathematician Cédric Villani (Fields Medal in 2010) (“À travers
    sa tentative de synthèse entre science et spiritualité, saluons le courage d’une
    pensée ardente qui refusa d’être une brique sagement rangée dans un édifice, si
    magnifique soit-il” Cédric writes) and there is a long [introduction](http://www.zones-sensibles.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/introduction_web.pdf)
    by physicist [Pierre Vanhove](http://ipht.cea.fr/Pisp/pierre.vanhove/) (who works
    on perturbative and non-perturbative string theory, among other topics). Pierre
    was the last people to be involved in the translation of the book from Russian
    to French – the amazing story is that this translation was first started in 1926
    by a friend of Florensky, so it took nearly one century to finish it! This is
    a fascinating book, even if you don’t understand all the formulas. If some Russian-speaking
    quants are interested, here a [link](http://www.runivers.ru/upload/iblock/25d/florensky.pdf) for the
    Russian text. A world where it would be possible to be faster than the speed of
    light *c* cannot but interest high-frequency traders…

    spin-off. I have been quite silent here about the ongoing battle between Vigilant
    Global and Jump/KCG/New Line Networks who seek to erect giant 305-mteer (or 322-meter
    – it’s a big difference as you’ll see later) in Richborough, UK, where the majority of
    the residents and the majority of the local public bodies don’t want such masts
    in their backyard. But the final verdict will be given by the Dover District Council,
    and the council is not required to follow the opinion coming from the different
    parishes. I have been following what’s going there for months now, obviously I
    read all planning application documents ([here](https://planning.dover.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=documents&keyVal=DCAPR_229267)
    and [there](https://planning.dover.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=documents&keyVal=DCAPR_228292)), I
    have exchanged dozens of emails with a local activist, Bass de Banaan, who is
    against the masts and worked hard to understand what’s going on there, and so
    on. As soon as the Dover District Council confirms the date of the meeting where
    the masts will be discussed (decided?) I’ll post the penultimate episode of “HFT
    in the banana land”. In the meantime, an article about this battle should appear
    in *Square Mile* magazine (UK), and a multimedia article should be online soon
    on the *Het Financieele Dagblad* website (Netherlands).

    not enough time to write the complete story of the microwave networks linking
    London and Frankufrt. Another problem is new networks showed up (or will show
    up soon), so it’s a never ending story. Life is short, I’m working on more interesting
    stuff and from February 2017 I’ll be [busier](https://gargantua.polytechnique.fr/siatel-web/linkto/mICYYYUJp7YK), so I

    cool stuff, 10 episodes at most. But I decided to write a book (or half a book) about
    this saga—I’ll detail in an upcoming episode. One of the reasons I got too much
    data is I have new friends—people working in the telco area—who helped me to spot
    new HFT dishes in France (human intel and field work are good). One even downloaded
    the (UK regulator) Ofcom data base to generate a [map](https://carte-fh.lafibre.info//index.php?zone=uk)
