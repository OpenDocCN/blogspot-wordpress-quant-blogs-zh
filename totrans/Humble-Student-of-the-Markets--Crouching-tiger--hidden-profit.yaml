    commodity-based indicators of Chinese growth. The Shanghai Composite remains in
    a downtrend. Even though it has staged a recent rally, the intermediate term trend
    is still down.

    Chinese growth, appear to be either stabilizing or undergoing a bullish reversal.
    For the purposes of this analysis, I will not show commodity indices because they
    are somewhat distorted by the spectacular rally in grain prices, but consider
    industrial commodities such as Dr. Copper, which has stopped falling and appears
    to be undergoing a period of sideways consolidation.

    Australia and Canada are positioned as major commodity exporters, but the Australian
    economy is more sensitive to Chinese growth while the Canadian economy is more
    levered to American growth. The AUDCAD cross rate has staged a bullish reversal
    that is similar to the pattern seen in the oil price.

    growth from infrastructure-based growth to growth based on the consumer, such
    a move would directly hurt the wealth of party cadres and insiders, who stood
    to benefit from the profitability of State Owned Enterprises (SOEs). This may
    be an edict that the leadership leads, but the bureaucracy doesn't go along.

    is to continue the path to re-balance growth toward China's household, or consumer.
    The actual policy response has been more of the same - stimulus via infrastructure
    growth.

    be no budgetary constraint. ***So the government can spend and invest very heavily
    into eternity either directly or via state-owned enterprises even though there
    is nothing that China really needs but have not already had. In other words, investment
    will be done regardless of the expected return.*** To fund that, the government
    (including state-owned companies for the purpose of argument) borrow either from
    state-owned banks (while force banks to lend) or from the bond market (for the
    purpose of the current discussion, let us just say that both ways of financing
    are more or less the same). Money supply has to grow at some crazy numbers, and
    M2 will probably double every 2 or 3 years, and Chinese Yuan will depreciate substantially
    (there is a running joke among China sceptics that Bernanke is only an amateur
    when it comes to money printing. After all, Chinese invented paper, printing,
    and paper money). But because this implies ever more over-capacity in the economy,
    inflation could be surprisingly low. At the end, GDP will grow by 8% in Chinese
    Yuan term, and nothing disastrous would seem to have happened to majority of Chinese
    people (or maybe not).

    resources into investing something that cannot generate return in excess of the
    cost of funding, the country as a whole will be destroying economic value even

    and have very low level of profit (if not close to zero as a whole), leaving the
    state-owned sector and local governments the only agents that will borrow and
    invest. The process of directing state-owned corporate sector to borrow and invest
    will generate output or GDP, but they will create even more capacity, leading
    to ever diminishing return. ***At the end, corporate profit (state-owned and private
    sectors combined) will fall to zero, if not negative.***

    on a policy of growth at any price, i.e. profit-less growth. So what we have is
    a case of crouching tiger (growth), but hidden profit (margin squeeze for corporates).
  prefs: []

    which benefit from infrastructure growth, are either consolidating or staging
    bullish reversals. On the other hand, Chinese corporates as reflected by the Shanghai
    Composite Index are falling, because their margins are getting squeezed.
