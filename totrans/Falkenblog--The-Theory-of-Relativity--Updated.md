# Falkenblog: The Theory of Relativity, Updated

> 来源：[http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2009/11/theory-of-relativity-updated.html#0001-01-01](http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2009/11/theory-of-relativity-updated.html#0001-01-01)

Watch this video on YouTube...the woman has this funny theory. She starts out asking, you do know what H2O is? You have heard of Einstein. Basically she notes

1) E=mc^2

2) As the diameter of protons, neutrons is about 1E-15 m, while the diameter of the atom is 1E-11\. Thus, all the mass in the galaxy would fit into a small ball.

3) Thus, the mass being small,

we can ignore it

, and so E=c^2.

This plays into her theory that we are all mere energy, which somehow means homeopathy works.

Only using mere words can one can make this mistake.
