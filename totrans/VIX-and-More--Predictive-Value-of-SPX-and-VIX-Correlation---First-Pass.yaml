    and all the chart reading and prep work for the coming week gets pushed off until
    Sunday, I thought I’d pass along some initial comments on the SPX and VIX correlation
    data I have been sifting through this morning.'

- en: The bottom line is that a highly correlated SPX and VIX does not bode well for
    the SPX across all the time frames I have been looking at, which start at three
    days and go out as far as three months.

  zh: 底线是，高度相关的SPX和VIX对我来说所有观察的时间框架（从三天到三个月）都不太妙。
- en: 'The other important piece of information is that the recent relatively strong
    positive correlation between the SPX and the VIX that I discussed in “[Divergence,
    History and Tells](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/04/divergence-history-and-tells.html)”
    is more historically significant that I first guessed.  Without getting down in
    the weeds, suffice it to say that a six factor correlation model I developed gave
    54 high correlation signals from 1990-1997 and only one cluster since then: 6
    signals in the July 2003 and a lone signal in September 2003.  That was until
    the current week, of course, which generated two very strong readings yesterday
    and the previous day -- and appears to be on course for another strong reading
    today, as both the SPX and the VIX are green as I write this.'

  zh: 另一个重要的信息是，我曾在文章“[Divergence, History and Tells](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/04/divergence-history-and-tells.html)”中讨论的SPX和VIX之间相对较强的正相关性比最初猜测的更有历史意义。不深入研究细节，总之，我开发的一个六因子相关模型在1990-1997年给出了54个高度相关信号，自那以后只有一个簇群：2003年7月有六个信号和一个孤立的信号在2003年9月。当然，直到当前这周，昨天和前天产生了两个非常强烈的读数——并且看起来今天还将产生另一个强烈的读数，因为在我写下这些内容时，SPX和VIX都是绿色的。
- en: You might think that the high correlation readings from 2003 would have presaged
    some of the bull market that was underway at the time.  While you can make that
    argument looking out a period of more than a month, if you are looking out less
    than a month, even the 2003 signals were decidedly bearish.

  zh: 你可能会认为2003年的高度相关读数应该预示了当时正在进行中的牛市。虽然你可以从这个角度来看一个超过一个月的时期，但如果你看少于一个月，即使是2003年的信号也是明显看跌的。

    up for those who are still pondering how to position their portfolio going into
    the weekend.
