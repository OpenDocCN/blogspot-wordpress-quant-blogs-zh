    14.96 points, but what does that mean?

- en: If history is any guide, the drop in the VIX may not be particularly meaningful.
    The previous largest drop in the VIX in absolute numbers dates back to September
    1, 1998\. On that day, there was a brief lull in the [Long-Term Capital Management](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Long%20Term%20Capital%20Management)
    crisis and the VIX pulled back from 44.28 to 36.48\. Just three days later, however,
    the VIX was back above 44.

    ago in [On the Rarity of a 20% One Day Drop in the VIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/09/on-rarity-of-20-one-day-drop-in-vix.html).
    Since that post, the VIX dropped 22.5% on [11/13/07](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/11/vxn-reversal-signal.html)
    and exactly 20% on [3/18/08](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/03/ratio-of-stocks-above-50-and-200-day.html).

    SPX has generally underperformed the historical averages slightly going forward.
