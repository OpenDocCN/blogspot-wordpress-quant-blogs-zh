    of bird flu at a <place st="on"><country-region st="on">UK</country-region></place>
    turkey farm over the weekend put bird flu stocks back in the spotlight once again.  Over
    the past two years, most of us have become largely desensitized to the possibility
    of a widespread bird flu outbreak, as each incident has spawned a less and less
    strident media frenzy.  In a sense, the same soft of desensitization has set in
    over the past year or two with bird flu, terrorism, $100/bbl. oil, Iraq/Iran,
    <country-region st="on"><place st="on">North Korea</place></country-region>, etc.  The
    media has a field day for awhile, but as the panic level subsides for a second
    or third time, the public sees these as more [cry wolf](http://www.storyarts.org/library/aesops/stories/boy.html)
    exercises and makes a mental note to ignore future scare tactics and, in many
    cases, completely tune out the entire issue.'

    it is not so much complacency that has set in as mass desensitization.

    in them and as such, they are part of the VIX [taxonomy of fear](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/01/on-nature-of-fear.html)
    (which I will someday formalize as the *VIXdex*.)  It should come as no surprise,
    then, that bird flu stocks have characteristics that are similar to that of the
    VIX.  Specifically, they tend to spike up sharply, then subside over time, with
    [patterns](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/01/what-to-expect-from-vix-spike.html)
    of 1 and 3-5 day spikes being relatively common.  Some of this can be seen in
    the BCRX daily chart, where the Williams %R and CCI are showing that four days
    into the move up, we have a good shorting opportunity:'
