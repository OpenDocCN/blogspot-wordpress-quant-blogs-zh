- en: Last week I talked a little bit about [VIX Options as Catastrophe Insurance](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/09/vix-options-as-catastrophe-insurance.html)
    and talked about how [VIX options](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20options)
    are priced off of [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures),
    not the cash/spot VIX index that is quoted in the press. A lot can happen in a
    week.

    10 to 60 as they were quoted (using the midpoint of the bid and ask) at about
    2:30 p.m. EDT on September 22^(nd) and again after the market closed on September
    29^(th).

- en: During the course of the week, the VIX jumped from 31.74 to 46.72, a 14.98 point
    gain or 47% increase. As you can see, even the deep in the money [VIX calls](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20calls)
    (i.e., the 10 and 15 strikes) failed to move even half as much in absolute terms
    as the cash VIX. The 30 strike, which was below the cash VIX prior to the spike,
    only moved about ¼ as much as the cash VIX. Looking out to the 45 strike, those
    VIX options gained all of 0.75, or about 5% as much as the cash VIX moved during
    the week.

    approximately 21%, from a little over 25 to a little over 31.

    particularly in and around the September 29 [VIX spike](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20spikes),
    going forward.
