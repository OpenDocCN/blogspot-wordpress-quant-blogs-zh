    that way. In fact, it is worse than it has been for 65 years. That’s the conclusion
    of [a recent study](http://www.santafe.edu/research/working-papers/abstract/263c5f6518c2dd9dd61e89418d009e9e/)
    by researchers who looked at the history of political polarization in the US since
    1949, as judged by congressional voting records. The study found that cooperation
    between members of different parties is now lacking more than ever before. Things
    were actually a lot better back in the Nixon era, even during the most divisive
    days of the Vietnam War and Watergate, when a President and Vice President were
    forced to resign, and even in the aftermath of the assassinations of Martin Luther
    King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy.
