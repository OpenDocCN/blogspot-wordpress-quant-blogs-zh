    highs until the first quarter of this year. The financial crisis put a dent in

    momentum. While bottom-up estimates remain relatively upbeat right now, investors
    should be prepared for downgrades in the near future as growth headwinds intensify.

    whose risks I detailed above, and the surging USD. Large cap SP 500 companies
    derive roughly 40% of their sales from foreign sources and a rising greenback,
    if unhedged, would cut into earnings translated back into USD. Under that scenario,
    large cap and small cap EBIT margins could converge (from my previous post

    directly comparable, this chart from UBS shows the differential in EBIT margins
    between the two. Should foreign growth start to slow, large and small cap EBIT
    margins will likely start to converge, with large cap margins falling toward their
    small cap counterparts for cyclical reasons.

    cycle, large caps will likely see a double whammy of reduced risk appetite, which
    would then see PE ratios compress.

    risky assets and falling growth expectations are negative for the stock market
    outlook. Indeed, my Risk Appetite Index, which consists of a long position in
    high-beta NASDAQ 100 (QQQ), Russell 2000 (IWM) and short positions in Consumer
    Staples (XLP), Utilities (XLU) and Telecom (IYZ), is starting to falter.

    are poised for a pullback of unknown duration and magnitude. However, bulls can
    be console by the fact that there is no recession in sight and therefore the risk
