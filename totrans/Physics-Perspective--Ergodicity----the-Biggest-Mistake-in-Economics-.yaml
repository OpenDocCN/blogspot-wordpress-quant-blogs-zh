    to compute "expected" returns in finance are, in many cases, simply inappropriate
    to making decisions in the real world. Take a risky gamble, and the usual average
    over different outcomes mixes potential worlds in which we go broke with others
    in we get rich, and, importantly, takes the often irreversible consequences of
    these outcomes (bankruptcy, for example) out of the picture. If you make hugely
    risky investments, this average gives you full credit for all the wonderful possible
    outcomes, weighted appropriately for their likelihood, which of course seems sensible.
    What it doesn't do is account for the very real fact that the bad outcomes may
    effectively wipe you out entirely and take you out of the game, making it impossible
    to play again -- in which case you will never get to experience those eventual
    big payoffs.

    suggests that the standard way of assessing risk versus reward in financial economics
    is wrong and systematically underestimates risks (and not merely because it ignores
    fat tails). The paper above, the first paper of Peters I mentioned above, and

    need to study it in detail a little more. I'm convinced that Peters insight --
    which brilliantly resolves the centuries old "St Petersburg paradox" of probability
    theory proposed originally by Bernoulli -- also has a lot to do with the work

    probability in time series suffers from some terrible misconceptions, and generally
    makes us underestimate risks. More coming on this soon.'
