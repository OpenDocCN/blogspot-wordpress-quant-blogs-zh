- en: ', Jim Cramer went on The Daily Show and was totally owned by John Stewart.
    Cramer went on hoping to merely apologize and then get in Stewart''s good graces,
    but Stewart didn''t let him off the hook. Stewart played some clips showing Cramer
    bragging about manipulating markets. Specifically, Cramer bragging about how easy
    it was to push the S&P futures down! Cramer is clearly exagerrating there, as
    this market is too large for Cramer to profitably move around, like you thinking
    you can push IBM up or down $10\. He also disavowed Rick Santelli''s rant against
    bailing out renters (oops! homeowners), saying "I don''t know where he grew up,
    but I''ve lived out of my car", in a clear attempt to pander to the audience as
    if he grew up in some great hardship (if you graduate from Harvard and then sleep
    in your car as a journalist during your first job, I don''t think that''s the
    same as growing up in Detroit, or being truly homeless). Clearly, Cramer is a
    braggart. He''s also overconfident about his opinions. He does not appear to have
    a good batting average. After this performance, I would add he''s a moral and
    intellectual coward. He didn''t defend his behavior, he tried to suck up to a
    celebrity bigger than him in a sycophantic way, and it didn''t work.'

  zh: ，吉姆·克莱默上了《每日秀》被约翰·斯图尔特完全击败了。克莱默上去希望道歉，然后和斯图尔特取得好感，但斯图尔特没有放过他。斯图尔特播放了一些剪辑，展示了克莱默夸称自己操纵市场的模样。具体来说，克莱默夸口说推动标准普尔指数期货下跌有多容易！克雷默在那里显然在夸大其词，因为这个市场对克雷默来说太大了，不可能利润丰厚地操纵，就像你认为你可以把IBM推高或拉低10美元一样。他还否认了瑞克·桑特利反对救助房东（糟糕！取而代之的是房屋所有者）的猛烈抨击，说“我不知道他是在哪里长大的，但我曾在我的车里住过”，这显然是为了讨好观众，仿佛他在极大的困苦中长大一样（如果你从哈佛毕业，然后在你第一份工作作为记者期间睡在你的车里，我认为那不同于在底特律长大，或者真正无家可归）。显然，克雷默是一个吹牛大王。他对自己的观点也过于自信。看起来他的预测准确率并不高。这一切表现之后，我只能说他是一个道德和智识的懦夫。他并没有为他的行为辩护，而是试图用奉承的方式讨好一个比他更大的名人，但却并没有成功。
- en: Nevertheless, Stewart is still profoundly wrong in his assumptions about this
    crisis. Stewart seemed to think that Cramer and CNBC knew that the market was
    a pure 'greater fool' play all along, where people are selling worthless crap
    to the next guy in a pure ponzi scheme. The implication was that CNBC had a financial
    incentive in hyping stocks, even though they knew it was worthless (I guess he
    thinks they are evil and stupid, because it would have to bust). But I don't think
    the people at CNBC 'knew' the market was overvalued. There are bears on the show
    every day, but there are always bears. If CNBC knew about 2008 in 2007, they would
    have been very prescient, but they did not. Its a very simplistic view of the
    world to think bad things happen out of bad faith, as with individuals this is
    often the case, with the madness of markets, it is much more complex.

  zh: 然而，斯图尔特在他对这场危机的假设上依然非常错误。斯图尔特似乎认为克雷默和CNBC一直知道市场是一个纯粹的‘白痴’游戏，人们在一个纯粹的庞氏骗局中向下一个人卖掉一堆毫无价值的东西。这暗示着CNBC在炒作股票上有金钱上的动机，即使他们知道这是毫无价值的（我猜他认为他们既邪恶又愚蠢，因为这个想法必然会失败）。但我不认为CNBC的人‘知道’市场被高估了。节目中每天都有看空的人，但总是有看空的人。如果CNBC在2007年就知道了2008年的事情，他们将会非常有远见，但他们没有。认为坏事是出于恶意发生的是对世界非常简单化的看法，尽管对个人来说这通常是正确的，但对于市场的疯狂来说，情况要复杂得多。

    caused by bad faith and 30 to 1 corporate leverage, is simply wrong. Most of the
    banks selling these mortgages had them on their balance sheets. They incorrectly
