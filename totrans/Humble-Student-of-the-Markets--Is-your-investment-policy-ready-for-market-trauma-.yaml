    their capital and growing it slowly and prudently is a totally appropriate strategy
    for this radical money easing environment. ***This type of policy breeds speculative
    and dubious rallies, but what they inevitably trigger are boom-bust cycles such
    as the ones we saw in 1999-2002, 2006-2009, and the current one we are in today***.

    goods, which is unlikely to change until the employment picture improves further.

    We have commodity prices on a tear, which is bullish, but evidence of systemic
