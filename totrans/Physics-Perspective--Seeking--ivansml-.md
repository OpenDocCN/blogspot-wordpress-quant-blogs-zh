# Physics Perspective: Seeking "ivansml"

> 来源：[http://physicsoffinance.blogspot.com/2012/09/seeking-ivansml.html#0001-01-01](http://physicsoffinance.blogspot.com/2012/09/seeking-ivansml.html#0001-01-01)

I'm finishing off my forthcoming book

*Forecast: What Extreme Weather Can Teach Us About Economics*

and have today been going over page proofs (extreme tedium...fixing typos etc). An important matter: I've referred in the book to some work on learning in macroeconomics (Evans and someone else) that was suggested to me by "ivansml", a graduate student at some European institution. Ivan: can you email me (buchanan.mark@gmail.com)? I would like to point out in a footnote that you directed me to this work. I can do this either using "ivansml" and referring to this site, or by using your real name (which I would rather do). THANKS!
