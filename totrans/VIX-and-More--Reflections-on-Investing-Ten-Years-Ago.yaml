    through some old files and came across my 1997 tax return. Fortunately, this had
    nothing to do with any communications with the IRS, but it got me to thinking
    about how my investing ‘evolution’ has three distinct long-term phases. Specifically,
    for the first ten years of my investment life, I dabbled in equities with mixed
    results at best, in much the same manner as Nicholas Darvas describes his early
    floundering in [How I made $2,000,000 in the Stock Market](http://www.amazon.com/How-Made-000-Stock-Market/dp/9562914534/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/103-6386437-2275810?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1190387412&sr=1-1).'

    my savings into mutual funds for the next five years or so, again with fair to
    middling results. I got a little ornery and started chasing momentum funds like
    those from PBHG and Van Wagoner, but ultimately concluded that it might be possible
    for me to try to mimic what they were doing by buying individual stocks on my
    own.

    to go ‘all in’ on a portfolio consisting entirely of internet stocks. While that
    may not sound all that surprising with the benefit of hindsight, very few investors
    were buying any internet stocks at the time and frankly there were not that many
    choices out there. I reasoned (and yes there was some hope involved too) that
    *if* most of the technology changes that were being touted at the time came to
    fruition, it could be a once in a lifetime investment opportunity.
