# Quantifiable Edges: SOX Gives Intermediate-Term Bullish Market Indication

> 来源：[http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2009/02/sox-gives-intermediate-term-bullish.html#0001-01-01](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2009/02/sox-gives-intermediate-term-bullish.html#0001-01-01)

A positive intermediate-term sign Wednesday was the fact that the Semiconductor Index (SOX) rose even as the S&P and Nasdaq suffered 1% declines. I first showed the below study

[on the blog last August](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2008/08/sox-bucks-selloff-again.html)

. I’ve updated the stats to run up until the present.

These are solidly bullish results with the winning percentage, the profit factor, and the average trade all posting strong numbers throughout the test period.

Not shown above is that over the next week the S&P has posted a close higher than the trigger day close 89% of the time. If you look out 12 days there has been at least 1 close higher than the trigger day in 42 of 43 instances (98%). The only loser came after the 7/21/98 signal. This has been a solidly bullish intermediate-term signal.
