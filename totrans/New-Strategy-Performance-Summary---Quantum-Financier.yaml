    to help compare better around the blogosphere, so here is the first example with
    it.

    market that we miss some attractive investment opportunity. As a matter of fact,
    I am particularly guilty on this one. I usually study the S&P 500 and its futures
    in my research. However for this one, I turn home to look at an ETF for Canadian
    Government Bonds (Yahoo ticker: XGB.TO) introduced to me in one of my classes.
    I tested a simple DV2 strategies using entry/exit at .5 and traded the strategy
    long and short. The results are below.'

- en: The results were impressive for such a simple strategies, the risk vs. return
    profile is also very good, I usually wouldn’t share a strategies with such good
    results but since it is so simple I figured why not. However, be careful with
    this, transaction costs would definitely impact performance. As a closing thought,
    I encourage you to look for trading ideas in places where you normally wouldn’t
    as you might be surprised by the results.

- en: '*QF-For the Sortino Ratio why not set the MAR equal to the benchmark’s historical
    returns for the period under consideration? It appears unrealistic to set an acceptable
    %-return at 0 given the opportunity costs associated with trading any strategy.
    The above suggestion is just one way (albeit a simple one) to consider given the
    hypothetical alternatives one could have had at the time a strategy was executed.*'

- en: So basically, here is the trade off, we either base the Sortino ratio on the
    excess return, or simply take the unprocessed return over the downside deviation.
    Both have their advantages, if we use the excess return, we take into account
    the opportunity cost of trading the strategy vs. buy and hold the benchmark. If
    we decide to compute the ratio using the normal return series, we gain the opportunity
    to put it in perspective with the Sharpe ratio as currently computed (Rf = 0%).
    We would basically get the Sharpe ratio computed only with the downside deviation
    (ie. no penalty for upside volatility). Alternatively, I could compute both measures
    with the excess return series. I would like reader feedback on this, so if you
    would just let me know in the comment section what you would prefer for the ratios
    and also what you think of the new performance summary as a whole, it would help
    me make it better for you!
