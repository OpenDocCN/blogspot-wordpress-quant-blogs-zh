    know by now that the entire VIX product landscape is based -- and priced -- off
    of VIX futures and one of the most important aspects of VIX futures is the shape
    of the term structure.

    (double red line) was closer to its historical average (wide gray line) than any
    prior year since the launch of VIX futures in 2004, with the average term structure
    over the course of the year demonstrating a relatively modest upward sloping term
    structure, also known as

    term structure for each year since the VIX futures were launched. In normalizing
    the data, I have set the average front month VIX futures contract to 100 and have
    expressed the averages of the second through seven months as multiples of the
    front month.  Note that the terms structure lines are dotted and somewhat wavy
    for 2004 – 2006, due to the fact that the CBOE did not implement a full complement
    of consecutive monthly futures until October 2006.

    that the term structure for 2015 was slightly flatter than average.  Looking back
    a couple more years, note that 2012 and 2013 saw the steepest term structure on
    record.  In the thirteen-year history of VIX futures, only two years saw a downward
    sloping term structure, also known as

    on four separate occasion and closed in backwardation on a total of 37 days –
