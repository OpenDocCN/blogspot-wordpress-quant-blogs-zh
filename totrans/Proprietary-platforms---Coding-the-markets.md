## Proprietary platforms

### May 31, 2006

Seems like every bank has to have a proprietary single dealer platform these days. JP Morgan has [JPMorganExpress](https://jpmorganexpress.jpmorgan.com/jpm/flowbiz/jpex/01.html), Lehman has [LehmanLive](https://live.lehman.com), and DrKW has [Revolution](https://www.drkwrevolution.com/Default.aspx). I have a hard time understanding who uses these, and why. If I'm a buy side trader, say a pension fund manager, and I need to buy 100m 10yr EuroGovies, why would I use a proprietary platform ?  Surely I'd go to [TradeWeb](http://www.tradeweb.com/default.aspx) or [Bloomberg](http://www.bloomberg.com/index.html), and do a multi dealer RFQ to get the best price ?

I know its the the job of the sales teams to schmooze the buy side traders. But the buy side guys get performance bonuses too, don't they ?

I know JPM's platform started development during the dotcom boom. As such it used Java applets to get interactive trading functionality into the browser. The DrKW offering looks Javaish too. I wonder if anyone's considering building a browser trading client with AJAX, or with the Adobe/Macromedia [Flash/RIA](http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Flex_Enterprise_Services:resources:articles:Architecting_RIA's_with_Flex_Data_Services) platform used by [Pandora](http://www.pandora.com) ?
