- en: As this site will become a subscription site in the near future (more details
    below), I was in the process of developing a standard legal disclaimer of why
    the content is not investment advice. Instead of just hiding behind standard legalese,
    I thought that I would write about the real issues that go beyond the regular
    regulatory framework.

    pitcher for the New York Yankees. You have it all figured out. I realized when
    I got to Gluskin Sheff how much I didn’t know.

- en: The whole life of a portfolio manager, their brain, is one giant distribution
    curve of outcomes. I’ve learned more in the past six years at Gluskin Sheff on
    the buy side, as a strategist and economist, than the previous twenty-two combined
    [in various sell side roles]. Because I figured out how to produce a forecast
    that’s meaningful for somebody who manages money for a living.

    a million $1 lottery tickets under this standard.'

    has to know a lot more about you in order to decide on how much to buy and sell
