- en: Interesting article from a Scrum Master at [Sky](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/so-were-going-qas-how-do-we-get-devs-enough-testing-steve-wells?),
    “So we’re going “No QAs”. How do we get the devs to do enough testing?”.

- en: I find it hard not to agree with a number of points in the article.  QAs in
    my mind are a get out of jail card for engineering to throw code over the wall
    and run to the next story.  Further, its a great excuse to avoid writing tests
    which a lot of engineer find boring.  Finally, its a great reason why TDD, and
    BDD (my preference) is largely ignored on a lot of projects, allowing engineer
    to assume the role of a “hacker”.

    or consider how to get to “done”.  They write the code, and refactor until though
    basic minimal manual testing, the solution does the right thing.  They then write
    a few tests, commit, and in their minds, they are done.  No QAs forces the engineering
    team to own responsibility and eat their own cut corners.

- en: Without QAs, the devs have a vested interest in speeding up testing by automation
    (which pure testers don’t; why would they put themselves out of a job?)

- en: The QA world has gone though various re-branding activities in the last few
    years.  More recently the “Check and Test” re-brand.  At the end of the day, a
    lot of defects are either due to the engineering solution, and lack of appropriate
    engineering tests (unit, integration, etc), or due to the problem not being fully
    defined during analysis/discussion of the story.

- en: QAs usually want to hold up a build until every possible test has been run.
     Unfortunately this isn’t the real world anymore.  Its not uncommon to make n
    releases a day, hour, week.  Further, business demands can mean that you need
    to release with defects, but the defects aren’t business critical.  We should
    also remember that the world isn’t perfect, and we are today, with technology,
    never going to release defect free software.  What is actually more important
    is having a continuous deployment pipeline that is efficient, so that if we find
    defects, we can release to resolve the issue.

- en: Which  brings us to defects.  Defects are defects when the acceptance criteria/tests
    fail, and the UI doesn’t look like the UX.  Are defects really defects when the
    story didn’t provide the appropriate information?  Or are they new features that
    emerged, that continue to refine the solution.  QAs in my view are hung up in
    defect tracking etc.  Maybe some QAs should consider looking for work in the Business
    Analysis land, or becoming engineers that can improve the standards of code delivered
    to production.  At the end of the day, the solution is only worth something when
    its in production, and being used.  Until that time, its waste, with no payback
