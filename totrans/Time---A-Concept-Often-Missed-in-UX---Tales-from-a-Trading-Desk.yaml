- en: One of the age old problems of designing an appropriate user interface ([UX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience_design))
    for an application is that the inherent issues of data delivery are often forgotten
    due to the nature of pen and paper ([sketching](http://uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com/2011/12/13/messy-art-ux-sketching/)). 
    Thus its important to remember when walking thought paper prototypes that many
    user mechanics could involve latency, thus taking an extreme view (a click incurs
    a 5 second delay before the UX reacts) might assist the overall UX delivered.
