    economy, when the liquidity wedge is small and leverage is high; the anxious economy,
    when the liquidity wedge is big and leverage is curtailed, and the general public
    is anxiously selling risky assets to more confident natural buyers; and, finally,
    the crisis or panicked economy, when many formerly leveraged natural buyers are
    forced to liquidate or sell off their positions to a reluctant public, often going
    bankrupt in the process. A recent but growing literature on leverage and financial
    markets has concentrated on crises or panicked economies. We concentrate on the
    anxious economy (a much more frequent phenomenon) and provide an explanation with
    testable implications for (1) contagion, (2) flight to collateral, and (3) issuance
    rationing. Our theory provides a rationale for three stylized facts in emerging
    markets that we describe below, and perhaps also explains some price behavior
    of other “emerging asset” classes like the US subprime mortgage market.'

    economy (say in high yield), increases the expected volatility of ultimate high
    yield payoffs, and creates more disagreement about high yield, but gives no information
    about emerging market payoffs. A critical element of our story is that bad news
    increases not only uncertainty, but also heterogeneity. When the probability of
    default is low, there cannot be much difference in opinion. Bad news raises the
    probability of default and also the scope for disagreement. Investors who were
    relatively more pessimistic before become much more pessimistic afterward. One
    might think of the anxious economy as a stage that is frequently attained after
    bad news, and that occasionally devolves into a sell-off if the news grows much
    worse, but which often (indeed usually) reverts to normal times. After a wave
    of bad news that lowers prices, investors must decide whether to cut their losses
    and sell, or to invest more at bargain prices. This choice is sometimes described
    on Wall Street as whether to catch a falling knife.

    to guarantee delivery. Assets in our model play a dual role: they are investment
    opportunities, but they can also be used as collateral to gain access to cash.
    The collateral capacity of an asset is the level of promises that can be made
    using the asset as collateral. This is an endogenous variable that depends on
    expectations about the distribution of future asset prices. Together with the
    interest rate, the collateral capacity determines an asset’s borrowing capacity,
    which is the amount of money that can be borrowed using the asset as collateral.
    The loan to value (LTV) of an asset is the ratio of the asset’s borrowing capacity
    to its price. The haircut or margin of an asset is the shortfall of its LTV from
    100 percent—in other words, the fraction of the price that must be paid in cash.
    The maximal leverage of an asset is the inverse if its margin. The leverage in
    the system, like the other ratios just mentioned, is determined by supply and
    demand; it is not fixed exogenously…'

    simultaneously creates the leverage cycle and the liquidity wedge cycle; that
    is why they run in parallel. Since leverage affects the liquidity wedge, the leverage
    cycle amplifies the liquidity wedge cycle. So what does collateral, and the possibility
    of leverage, add to the liquidity wedge cycle already discussed? It generates
    a bigger price crash, not due to asset undervaluation during anxious times, but
    due to asset overvaluation during normal times. This may lead the press to talk
    about asset price bubbles.

    smaller emerging market economies, their description appears to sound an awful
    lot like the American and European economies in the current environment of rising
    concerns about sovereign debt.

    would be willing to pay and the rate pessimists would be willing to take. As we
    shall see, the liquidity wedge is a useful way of understanding asset prices.
    When the liquidity wedge increases, the optimists discount the future by a bigger
    number, and all asset prices for which they are the marginal buyers fall. The
    liquidity wedge increases because the disagreement between optimists and pessimists
    about high yield grows, increasing the desire of optimists to get their hands
    on more money to take advantage of the high yield buying opportunity. The portfolio
    and consumption effects create a liquidity wedge cycle: as the real economy moves
    back and forth between the normal and the anxious stage, the liquidity wedge ebbs
    and flows.'
