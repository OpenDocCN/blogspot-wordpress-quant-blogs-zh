- en: Time for an informal poll again.  Raise your hand if you keep track of VIX SMAs
    going back more than 20 days.  What about SMAs going back 1000 days?  You may
    think I’m crazy (sometimes I like to pretend to be crazy just to be a little more
    provocative, so consider the possibility that I’ve merely intentionally unhinged
    my brain for awhile,) but if you put any credence in the idea of [VIX macro cycles](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20macro%20cycles)
    and think it is possible for [VIX cycles to last 2-4 years](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/09/vix-macro-cycles.html),
    why not look at the [VIX’s long-term moving averages](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/09/vwsi-ends-volatile-week-at-1.html)?

    closely resembles, one year I do not recall any reference to is [1996](http://www.cnn.com/EVENTS/1996/year.in.review/main.html).  Look
    at the chart below and consider that 1996 was not a bad time to initiate an aggressive
    buy and hold strategy.  Do you remember what Yahoo looked like in 1996?  No, not
    the stock (which opened at a split-adjusted 1.05 in April and could be had for
    0.64 in July), but the [1996 Yahoo web site](http://web.archive.org/web/19961017235908/http:/www2.yahoo.com/).
