    I preached, the more I am convinced that most of the time, we are hedging the
    wrong risks.

    is our goal, we should simply reduce leverage, as I have argued in my previous
    article. If volatility in a particular industry group is too much for us, (banks?
    brokerages? energy stocks?), just reduce the capital allocation in that group.

    to your heart's content. Kelly's formula tells us that the higher the Sharpe ratio,
    the higher the compounded growth rate of your wealth. The problem is, many of
    us hedge even when doing so do not clearly increase Sharpe ratio. A further problem
    is that we can achieve this maximum growth rate only if we use the high leverage
    recommended by Kelly's formula, but this leverage often exceeds what our brokerage
    would allow us. It is not clear that it is beneficial to waste our buying power
    on the hedge if we can only operate at sub-optimal leverage.

    to zero) due to unexpected, catastrophic events. (Many sophisticated hedge fund
    managers cannot even meet this simple survival criterion, giving lie to the whole
    notion of "hedge" funds.)

    be 20%. Furthermore, let's assume that you are able to endure a 30% reduction
    in equity during one trading period. Then you should not be afraid to have a net
    long exposure of 150% of your equity. In other words, not only should you not
    hedge, but you should go ahead and leverage your long-only portfolio 1.5 times.

    of our lives. We should avoid ruin, not mere losses. Otherwise, you will be paying
    too much on the insurance policy over the long term. In other words, max out the
    deductible on your insurance policy!
