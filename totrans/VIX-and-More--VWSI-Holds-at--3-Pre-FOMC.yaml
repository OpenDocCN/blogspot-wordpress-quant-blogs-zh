    in the same dramatic fashion.  In fact, the successive weekly drops in the VIX
    11.7% and 9.0% marks only the third instance since the March 2000 market top that
    the VIX has fallen at least 9% for two consecutive weeks.  For mean reversion
    aficionados, the last four times the VIX has fallen at 9% or more two weeks in
    a row, in the subsequent week the VIX has changed +40%, +6%, +19%, and -3%.

    is holding steady at +3, a marginally bearish signal for the overall markets.

    reading Alan Greenspan’s [The Age of Turbulence](http://www.amazon.com/Age-Turbulence-Adventures-New-World/dp/1594201315)
    – an excellent read so far.  One of the recurring themes in the book is how the
    resilience of the economy always seems to exceed his expectations.  For more on
    the Fed, try my [Fed Links](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/03/fed-links.html).

    I encourage the reader to sample Gary Vaynerchuk's "[Sauvignon Blanc Taste-Off](http://tv.winelibrary.com/2007/05/30/the-sauvignon-blanc-taste-off-episode-245/)"
