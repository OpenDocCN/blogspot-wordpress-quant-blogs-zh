    its 200 day moving average for the first time since the end of 2007.

- en: The first question traders should ask themselves is whether this technical artifact
    has any relevance to trading. The simple answer is that it depends upon how many
    people pay attention to the 200 day moving average and incorporate rules related
    to it in their trading methodologies. For example, there are many traders who
    prefer – or insist upon – long positions only when the instrument in question
    is above its 200 day moving average and short positions only when it is below
    the 200 day moving average. In sum, if enough people pay attention to the 200
    day moving average, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy of sorts.

    decisions? Condor Options took up this subject earlier today in [Exponentially
    Curb Your Enthusiasm](http://www.condoroptions.com/index.php/market-commentary/exponentially-curb-your-enthusiasm/)
    and concluded that since 1965, long only strategies that incorporated the 200
    day simple moving average (SMA) and exponential moving average (EMA) for the SPX
    both beat a simple buy and hold approach. (Interestingly, the EMA approach had
    a better track record than the SMA approach.)

    generate excellent timing signals. Note that from 1996-2000 and 2003-2007, the
    200 day SMA kept investors in the bull market almost all the time. Investors would
    have been in cash (or perhaps even short) during the 2000-2003 bear market and
    from the beginning of 2008 to the present.

    in the 200 day SMA, which actually peaked in January 2008.

- en: Before getting too excited about the 200 day SMA, it is important to look under
    the hood at the data that goes into the calculations. Right now, the 200 day window
    includes data going back to August 19, 2008, when the SPX closed at 1266.69\.
    Tomorrow that number will be dropped from the calculations and replaced with one
    that is likely to be close to today’s close of 942.46\. That is 324 points lost
    from the index calculations, which means that if the markets drift sideways, the
    200 day SMA will be declining at rate of about 1.6 points per day as the higher
    closes from August scroll off. In fact, since the beginning of 2009, the 200 day
    SMA has dropped 48, 46, 69, 46 and 37 points in each of the last five months.

    almost three calendar months behind us. That translates into 61 and 62 trading
    days. It also means that the March lows will be in the midpoint of the data series
    in 38-39 trading days, which means that the 200 day SMA is most likely to continue
    to decline until the last week in July before turning back up.

- en: So, go ahead and consider the 200 day SMA to be a potential support level or
    long/short inflection point, but going forward, this line on the charts should
    continue to decline and be less and less relevant, unless, of course, the markets
    follow the green line down.
