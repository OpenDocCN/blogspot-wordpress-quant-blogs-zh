    a monetary tightening transformed into a monetary loosening: Although the US economy

    Even though inflation pressures currently appear low and the recovery seems fragile,
    asset prices are soaring, raising the specter of new bubbles that could jeopardize
    financial stability. U.S. stocks are trading at all-time highs, with the SP 500
    up 29.6% in 2013, it's highest annual gain in 16 years. U.S. house prices rose
    11.2% nationally in the year to the end of September 2013 with Las Vegas and San
    Francisco up 29.1% and 25.7% respectively, according to the S&P/Case-Shiller index.

    approach by using a 7% unemployment threshold to guide the market''s expectations
    of when it will start to raise rates. But U.K. house prices are now rising by
    8% a year, raising concerns the market may soon start over-heating. That means
    the BOE''s strategy of keeping rates low until 2015 may depend on its ability
    to deploy so-called macroprudential tools to restrict the supply of mortgage credit.'

    could lead to a repeat of last year's market stress. Indeed, the potential for
    market volatility may have increased as a result of new bank capital rules which
    have made banks more reluctant to provide liquidity.

    \ in recent years have been ineffective. We reach a different conclusion, which\
    \ is that the main way in which such balance sheet changes have worked is probably\
    \ not through the operation of a portfolio rebalancing of private sector portfolios\
    \ undertaken in an environment of *normally functioning \Nfinancial markets*.\
    \ But large-scale asset purchases undertaken in an environment when \Nfinancial\
    \ markets are not working normally may well have significant effects. Indeed,\
    \ there is substantial empirical evidence that they do. Such effects may reflect\
    \ limits to arbitrage in stressed conditions. Vayanos and Vila (2009) focus on\
    \ such limits. And there are alternative channels through which asset purchases\
    \ may work. Durre and Pill (2012), for example, argue that the main way in which\
    \ the central bank using its balance sheet has affected the wider economy is through\
