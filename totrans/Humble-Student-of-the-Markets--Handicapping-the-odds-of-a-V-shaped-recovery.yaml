- en: Last week's stock market rally appears to be based on the hopes of a V-shaped
    economic recovery, powered by the combination of all-in monetary stimulus, and
    fiscal stimulus, as evidenced by a $2 trillion bill passed in Congress. Street
    consensus is now a V-shaped rebound, with a trough in Q2\. This Goldman Sachs
    forecast is just one of many examples.

- en: How realistic is the prospect of a V-shaped recovery? The economy is clearly
    either in a recession, or entering recession. LPL Financial found that recessionary
    bear markets last an average of 18 months compared to non-recessionary bears,
    which last only 7 months. That finding is inconsistent with the current Street
    expectation of a brief and sharp slowdown.
