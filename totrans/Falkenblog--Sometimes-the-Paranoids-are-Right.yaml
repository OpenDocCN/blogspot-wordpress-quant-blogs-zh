  zh: Slate关于《误入歧途》的内容：
- en: They all knew that if I was hurting in one market, I'd have to liquidate in
    the other markets. ... I still think that the crash of Oct. 27, 1997, was basically
    due to brokers running my position against me, knowing that I was on the ropes.
    The market had its greatest drop in the previous 10 years that day. And then the
    next day, once they were able to force me out, it went up more than it dropped.

  zh: 所有人都知道，如果我在一个市场上受损，我将不得不在其他市场上清仓。......我依然认为，1997年10月27日的崩盘基本上是经纪商反其道而行之，他们知道我陷入困境。那天，市场经历了过去10年来最大的跌幅。然后第二天，一旦他们能够迫使我清仓，市场上涨的幅度超过了下跌。
- en: I knew a guy affiliated with a major player in the the CME at that time, and
    he told me about how at one point the executor of Niederhoffer's position was
    conspicuous in the pit, and it was clear he was going to execute a large trade
    to get out. As Niederhoffer's losses mandated a margin call, the person who liquidated
    this position had no skin in the game, and did not put any thought into doing
    it with minimal impact. He asked for a bid, and all the floor traders held their
    breath and looked at each other. Finally, one trader made an absurdly low bid,
    at which point they all piled on at that same price. It was, as my acquaintance
    said, his large company's single best day ever in the pits, suggesting that they
    not only made Niederhoffer pay extra, but many smaller fish trying to time this--and
    ignoring the game theory--also got shellacked.

  zh: 我认识一个与芝加哥商品交易所(CME)的主要交易者有关系的人，他告诉我，尼德霍夫执行仓位的时候曾在交易现场引人注目，很明显他要进行大单交易以平仓。由于尼德霍夫的损失要求进行追加保证金，这个卖掉仓位的人对此并不关心，也没考虑以最小影响进行交易。他要价，所有交易员都屏住呼吸，互相对视。最后，一位交易员以一个荒谬的低价出价，于是他们都以同样的价格跟进。正如我的熟人所说，这对他所在的大公司来说是职业生涯中最棒的一天，这意味着不仅让尼德霍夫多付了钱，也让许多试图时机操作的小鱼——而且忽视博弈论——也吃了大亏。

    always creates tremendous obstruction and friction from the adversary, so often
    the indirect approach is necessary.'
