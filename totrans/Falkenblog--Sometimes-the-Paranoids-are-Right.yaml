    the other markets. ... I still think that the crash of Oct. 27, 1997, was basically
    due to brokers running my position against me, knowing that I was on the ropes.
    The market had its greatest drop in the previous 10 years that day. And then the
    next day, once they were able to force me out, it went up more than it dropped.

    he told me about how at one point the executor of Niederhoffer's position was
    conspicuous in the pit, and it was clear he was going to execute a large trade
    to get out. As Niederhoffer's losses mandated a margin call, the person who liquidated
    this position had no skin in the game, and did not put any thought into doing
    it with minimal impact. He asked for a bid, and all the floor traders held their
    breath and looked at each other. Finally, one trader made an absurdly low bid,
    at which point they all piled on at that same price. It was, as my acquaintance
    said, his large company's single best day ever in the pits, suggesting that they
    not only made Niederhoffer pay extra, but many smaller fish trying to time this--and
    ignoring the game theory--also got shellacked.

    always creates tremendous obstruction and friction from the adversary, so often
    the indirect approach is necessary.'
