    bull market under our belts. On the contrary, [in a series of columns beginning
    in March 2010](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/stocks-tend-to-take-sovreign-debt-crises-in-stride-2010-03-01),
    I regularly pointed out that the stock market usually takes currency and sovereign
    debt crises very much in stride.

    such crises over the prior two decades. The crises on which I focused were the
    1994 Mexican peso devaluation and associated crisis; the Thai government debt
    crisis 1997 (which led to the term “Asian contagion”); the 1998 Russian ruble
    devaluation in August 1998 (which led to the bankruptcy of Long-Term Capital Management),
    and the 2001 Argentine government debt/currency crisis.

    these four crises. For both data series, 100 represents the stock market’s level
    when those crises first broke onto the world financial scene. Notice that equities’
    reaction over the four years following the Greek crisis was remarkably close to
    the average of its behavior in the wake of the previous crises.

    Turkey Tantrum will blow over.
