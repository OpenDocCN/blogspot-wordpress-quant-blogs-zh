# Coral8 & PowerShell

If you use Coral8 on Windows, and you use Powershell for other development and admin tasks, you may be interested in the powershell navigation provider and cmdlets which I've uploaded to [http://code.google.com/p/coral8shell/](http://www.linkedin.com/redirect?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcode%2Egoogle%2Ecom%2Fp%2Fcoral8shell%2F&urlhash=x4Zq&_t=disc_detail_link) The nav provider supports basic cd and ls commands for workspaces, applications, and streams. For admin tasks, the following cmdlets have been created Get-C8Status, Get-C8App, Add-C8App, Remove-C8App, Start-C8App, Stop-C8App
