# VIX and More: More Top Emerging Markets ETFs

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/08/more-top-emerging-markets-etfs.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/08/more-top-emerging-markets-etfs.html#0001-01-01)

Entirely by accident, the theme of the last two [charts of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week) has been [emerging markets](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/emerging%20markets). A week ago, in [Chart of the Week: Rethinking Geography](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/08/chart-of-week-rethinking-geography.html), I chose to highlight how Asian and European emerging markets ETFs had very similar performance charts, much more so than the relationship between each emerging market and its continent-specific developed market counterpart. Yesterday, in [Chart of the Week: Irrepressible Colombia (GXG)](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/08/irrepressible-colombia-gxg.html), I highlighted the 42% returns that the Global X/InterBolsa FTSE Colombia 20 ETF ([GXG](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/GOOG)) has managed to post this year, tops among the geography-based ETFs.

As it turns out, there are four other country ETFs which have posted returns of over 20% this year. In the chart below I have highlighted these single country emerging market ETFs and added a fifth top performer for good measure. Ranked in terms of 2010 performance, these ETFs are for Thailand ([THD](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/THD)), Chile ([ECH](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/ECH)), Malaysia ([EWM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EWM)), Indonesia ([IDX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/IDX)) and Turkey ([TUR](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TUR)).

On a related note, I had previously made two references to the Claymore/Zacks Country Rotation ETF ([CRO](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/CRO)) as one option for investors who might be looking for an ETF which took advantage of a third party “[strategy-in-a-box](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Strategy-in-a-Box%20ETFs)” country rotation model. For the record, aftera disappointing run, Claymore Securities is set to close CRO in at the end of next week, with the last day of trading on September 10^(th).

Even in a flat market, ETFs with 20% annual returns are out there. Sometimes it takes a little creative thinking to find them and get on board in time to capture a large portion of that move.
