Further to my last post (see

[Why China won't cause a commodity crash (yet)](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2012/11/why-china-wont-cause-commodity-crash-yet.html)

), I got a number of questions of what indicators I watch beside the Vancouver residential property market to see when the commodity supercycle is over.

[Chart of the Day](http://www.chartoftheday.com/indexb.htm)

 latest chart showed a graph of the Dow/gold ratio. Watch for a reversal of that trend - then you'll know that paper is triumphant over hard assets (commodities).
