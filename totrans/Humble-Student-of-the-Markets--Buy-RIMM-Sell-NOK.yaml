    trade to put on is to buy RIMM and short AAPL, largely on the basis of positive
    buzz about the newest device, the Blackberry 10\. At that point, I shuddered.
    Putting on such a trade has two implicit bets:'

- en: While AAPL's stock price has been deflating lately, talk that it is losing its
    competitive edge may be premature. To double down and then bet on the Blackberry
    10 is like putting your money down on a long-shot exacta at the track - a risky
    proposition.

    positive momentum in favor of RIMM. The pair has been in a long relative downtrend
    as AAPL has outperformed RIMM for over five years. If you were to look at this
    chart, how confident are you further upside?

    to buy RIMM and sell NOK. Both are perceived to be failing brands among wireless
    device makers, though RIMM is exhibiting positive momentum.

    upside.

    on the Blackberry 10, this is probably a better and more risk-controlled way to
    make that bet.'
