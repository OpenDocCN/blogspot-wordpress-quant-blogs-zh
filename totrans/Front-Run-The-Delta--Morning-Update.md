# Front-Run The Delta: Morning Update

> 来源：[https://frontrunthedelta.blogspot.com/2007/10/portfolio-update.html#0001-01-01](https://frontrunthedelta.blogspot.com/2007/10/portfolio-update.html#0001-01-01)

Near the close yesterday, I sold my holding of GE realizing a 2% loss.

I have been watching

[Fluor (FLR)](http://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=flr)

for some time, waiting for a fair position to move in. Yesterday's 4% loss presented a good entry point for a short term gain. I don't expect to hold for more than a day or two.

FD: I have a long position in FLR.
