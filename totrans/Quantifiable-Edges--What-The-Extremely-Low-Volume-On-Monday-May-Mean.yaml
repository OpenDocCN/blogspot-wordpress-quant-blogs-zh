    Letter on Sunday the intermediate-term outlook moved from slightly bullish to
    slightly bearish. The move was based on recent research, some of which appeared
    on the blog while some was for subscribers only. Today’s action did nothing to
    make me feel more bullish.

    since the week between Christmas and New Years. I looked back in history to see
    how the market performed any time the S&P 500 rose 1% or more on the lightest
    volume in at least 20 days. Results looking back 30 years below:'

    issue when looking at low volume studies, though is holidays. Six of the instances
    happened on a shortened session near either 4th of July or Thanksgiving. Those
    were 7/3/1997, 7/3/2000, 11/24/2000, 11/23/2001, 7/5/2002, and 11/23/2007\. Two
    things are notable about these dates: 1) 7/5/2002 was followed by a massive 19%
    selloff over the next 12 days which skewed the above results negatively. 2) Most
    of the other holiday instances were followed by rallies which skewed results positively.
    I re-ran the study excluding these instances. Those results over the last 30 years
    are listed below:'

    Even eliminating the massive 7/2002 outlier the remaining results have a strong
    bearish tilt.
