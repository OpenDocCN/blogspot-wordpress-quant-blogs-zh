    on a day when the DJIA is down 230 points, but I’m not going to let that stop

    to believe that the markets are poised to continue to go up from current levels.
    The first of these, as highlighted by J.J. McGrath on his

    index just turned positive for the first time since late October. While this is
    by no means a guarantee that the markets are moving up, this signal has historically
    been a bullish one. Perhaps more importantly, one way to think about the size
    of the red areas under the zero line is that these represent bearish periods in
    which pent-up demand continued to accumulate under the surface, roughly proportionate
    to the duration and magnitude of the red spike.'

    into the market and advance decline data turning positive, suggesting that the
    tide has turned. At this stage, only options sentiment data needs to normalize
    to indicate that the retail investor is once again comfortable going long and
    helping to push the market out of the recent trading range.
