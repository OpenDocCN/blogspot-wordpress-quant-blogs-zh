    Another duo Andrea Frazzini and Lasse Heje Pedersen have expanded our world with
    their [Betting Against Beta (BAB) and Quality Minus Junk (QMJ)  factors](http://www.econ.yale.edu/~af227/). 
    The combined factor set of Fama/French and Frazzini/Pedersen provides substantial
    insight into the historical performance of equities in the US and around the world.

    BAB and QMJ are not updated like the Fama/French SMB and HML~~. (actually discovered
    this is no longer true [Frazzini data library](http://www.econ.yale.edu/~af227/data_library.htm)) 
    Still though, combining these factors with the R packages factorAnalytics and
    rCharts allows us to do some amazing things.  Here is a quick example. Look for
    more soon.
