    the most part, members of our species simply repeat what they are told-and become
    upset if they are exposed to any different view. The characteristic human trait
    is not awareness but conformity……Other animals fight for territory or food; but,
    uniquely in the animal kingdom, human beings fight for their ‘beliefs’……The reason
    is that beliefs guide behaviour, which has evolutionary importance among human
    beings. But at a time when our behaviour may well lead us to extinction, I see
    no reason to assume we have any awareness at all. We are stubborn, self-destructive
    conformists. Any other view of our species is just a self-congratulatory delusion*”

  zh: “*人类从不为自己思考，他们觉得这太不舒服。在大多数情况下，我们的物种成员只是重复别人告诉他们的话，并且如果他们接触到任何不同的观点就会感到不安。人类的特征不是意识，而是遵从……
    其他动物会为领地或食物而战斗；但是，独特之处在于人类会为他们的‘信念’而战斗…… 原因在于信念引导行为，在人类中具有进化重要性。但是，在我们的行为可能导致我们灭绝的时刻，我无法理由地认为我们有任何意识。我们是顽固的、自我毁灭的顺从者。对我们物种的任何其他看法都只是一种自吹自擂的幻想*”

- en: Its far too natural for us humans to make the socially acceptable choices in
    life. We are punished via negative reinforcement for making decisions that are
    not conventional.  As it is often said- it is better to fail conventionally than
    fail unconventionally, for the blame will be placed on  the individual versus
    the circumstances when taking the path less travelled. If you buy and hold, you
    can always blame a poor market for your losses, in contrast you will typically
    get credit for skill in good markets. In contrast the trader will face intense
    scrutiny for underperforming in a  good markets, and receive credit for performing
    well in a poor market.   Trading is no different from any other endeavour that
    is crippled by our primitive decision-making facilities. For all the intelligence
    that exists in the world, few of us wish to be different, and the logical few
    are only too aware of the severe costs of making unconventional decisions that
    fail—even when they know it is the right choice.

  zh: 对我们人类来说，作出社会上可接受的选择是非常自然的。我们因为做出不符合常规的决定而受到负面反馈。常常有人说，失败般地遵循常规总比不自然地失败好，因为当走少有人走的路时，责任会被归咎于个人而不是环境。如果你买入并持有股票，你总可以将你的损失归咎于糟糕的市场，相比之下，你通常会因为在好的市场表现出色而受到赞扬。相反，交易者在好的市场表现不佳时将面临严格的审查，而在糟糕的市场表现出色时将受到赞誉。交易与我们原始决策能力受限的任何其他努力一样。尽管世界上存在许多智慧，但我们中很少有人愿意与众不同；而那些有逻辑的少数人则非常清楚做出失败（即使他们知道这是正确的选择）的不常规决定所带来的严重后果。
- en: Standing alone when the crowd is against you is that hardest thing to do. Thinking
    differently about things and questioning the root assumptions that all of us take
    for granted is a common trait of most successful traders. This does not mean that
    you have to be a contrarian– a true non-conformist that is logical and self-aware
    will try to recognize when the crowd is right, and when the crowd is wrong. It
    is overly simplistic to believe that the crowd is always wrong. In fact, the truth
    is that conforming to certain accepted standards and practices in any profession
    will keep you out of trouble. You are receiving the benefit of collective experience–an
    evolutionary trait that was developed to pass on knowledge so that in times past
    we would not eat poisonous plants, or try to hunt dangerous animals. In reference
    to investing, its hard to go very wrong by sticking to the basics of diversification
    and good asset allocation. Its hard to go wrong by sticking with a typical but
    well thought out plan. Conformity will keep you within the great bell curve of
    success—your probability of failure is now much lower than learning things for
    yourself. However the flip side is that your probability of extreme success is
    also now much lower. To really be in the 2nd or 3rd standard deviation of traders,
    you will have to think for yourself and question broad assumptions. This inevitably
    means that you will faces greater chances of failure along the way. But if you
    read books about world-famous traders you will quickly realize that almost every
    single one struggled for years developing their unique strategies  before becoming
    massively successful.

  zh: 当众人反对时独自站立是最困难的事情。对事物有不同的思考方式并质疑我们所有人都视为理所当然的根本假设是大多数成功交易者的共同特点。这并不意味着你必须成为一个唱反调的人——一个真正的非
    conformist，有逻辑且自我意识的人会尝试识别出众人正确和错误的时候。简单地认为众人总是错的是过于简单化了。事实上，符合任何职业中某些被接受的标准和实践将使你远离麻烦。你正在受益于集体经验——一种进化的特征，用来传递知识，以便在过去的时代我们不会吃有毒植物，或者试图猎捕危险的动物。关于投资，坚持多元化和良好的资产配置的基础很难出错。坚持一个典型但经过深思熟虑的计划很难出错。遵循规范将使您处于成功的大钟形曲线内——您失败的可能性现在比自己学习要低得多。然而，反面是，你极端成功的可能性现在也要低得多。要真正成为第二或第三个标准偏差的交易者，你必须自己思考并质疑广泛的假设。这不可避免地意味着你在路上会面临更大的失败几率。但是如果你读一些世界著名交易者的书，你很快就会意识到几乎每个人在成为成功之前都经历了多年的独特策略的发展。
- en: If your goal is to ensure a good chance of modest success, than follow the conventional
    advice and stick with your plan. If your goal is to be a top trader then you will
    have to experiment and think for yourself and constantly learn and fail. You probably
    will not succeed, but you certainly have no chance of getting there if you do
    not try. So try to learn the hard way by keeping your bets small and always learning,
    and when you start becoming consistent and successful you can slowly increase
    your bet size. There is no rule that you need to go broke trying!

  zh: 如果你的目标是确保一种适度成功的机会，那么遵循常规建议并坚持你的计划。如果你的目标是成为一名顶级交易者，那么你将不得不进行实验，自己思考，并不断学习和失败。你可能不会成功，但如果你不尝试，你肯定不会成功。所以试着通过保持你的赌注小和不断学习来艰难学习，当你开始变得稳定和成功时，你可以慢慢增加你的赌注大小。没有规则说你必须因为尝试而破产！
