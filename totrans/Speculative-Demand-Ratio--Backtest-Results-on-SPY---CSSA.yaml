- en: This is a backtest of using the Speculative Demand Ratio on the S&P  500 (SPY)
    using the 9 sector spyder ETFs to measure risk sentiment. The construction methodology
    involves taking the 20-day change in 20-day average dollar volume as a proxy for
    the change in money flow. Then we take the 4 highest sector spyder ETFs by 100-day
    HV (historical volatility) and take the change in money flow for these 4 versus
    the lowest 4 by 100-day HV. This is the speculative demand ratio or SDR—which
    captures the money flow into risky assets within an index versus the less risky
    assets within the index. The ratio is normalized using a 1-year percentile rank.
     As you can see, the SDR is an excellent intermediate-term trend system for trading
    the S&P500\. Entering long when the SDR is at extreme highs and exiting below
    the median produces a very high w% as well as a healthy w/l ratio typical of trend-following
    systems. The average days per trade is roughly 20 days, and the average trade
    is a very tradeable +2%–easily surviving commissions.
