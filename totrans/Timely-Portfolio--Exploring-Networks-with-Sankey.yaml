    I started experimenting with an [rCharts](http://rcharts.io/site) implementation
    of the [d3 sankey plugin](https://github.com/d3/d3-plugins/blob/master/sankey/sankey.js). 
    While I was putting together examples, I found lots of gaps in my knowledge of
    sankeys and network analysis.  I did not want to let good learning go to waste,
    so I put together this quick tutorial documenting what I learned.  Click [here](http://timelyportfolio.github.io/rCharts_d3_sankey/example_build_network_sankey.html)
    or on the screenshot below to see it.

    well in Portfolio Appraisal/Holdings type reports where nodes represent household,
    client accounts, asset classes, and security types.  Edge weight would be $ or
    % in each.
