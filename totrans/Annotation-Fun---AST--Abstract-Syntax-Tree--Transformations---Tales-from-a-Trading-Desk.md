## Annotation Fun – AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) Transformations

Another airport, another day. Kicking around some ideas with reactive, Java, data tables and protocols.  Whilst trying to achieve a more reactive solution that reduced a few coding problems, I considered leveraging annotations, but after kicking around a few coding ideas, I believe I might be better off with custom [AST](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-lombok/) (Abstract Syntax Tree) transformations, via Lombok.  Lets hope AST’s achieve the elegant code solution I’m looking for.
