- en: An unusual anomaly arose during the latest banking crisis when a long-standing
    historical relationship broke apart. When bank stocks skidded in response to the
    problems that first appeared at Silicon Valley Bank, the 2-year Treasury yield
    fell dramatically, indicating a rush for the safety of Treasury assets. What was
    unusual this time was the weakness in the USD. The greenback has rallied during
    past financial scares and crises as investors piled into the safety of the USD
    and Treasury paper. This time, Treasuries did reflect a flight to safety, but
    not the USD. As the USD has been inversely correlated to the S&P 500, and the
    dollar can’t advance even with the macro tailwind of a banking crisis, what does
    this mean for asset returns?
