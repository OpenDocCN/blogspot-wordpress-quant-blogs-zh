    tone of the market. If the major market averages are rising, but breadth indicators
    are not confirming the advance, this can be described as the generals leading
    the charge, but the troops are not following. Such negative divergences are signs
    of technical weakness that may be a precursor to future market weakness.

- en: I have been highly skeptical of breadth indicators as a technical analysis tool
    because breadth divergences can take a long time for the market to resolve, if
    at all. The chart below shows the SPX, the “generals”, along with several indicators
    of how the “troops” are behaving, namely the mid-cap and small cap indices, as
    well as the the NYSE Advance-Decline Line.

    During the advance from 1998 to 2000, the NYSE A-D Line fell and flashed a negative
    divergence sell signal. At the same time, both the mid- and small-cap indices
    continued to rise and confirmed the market advance. Which divergence should investors
    believe?

    represented a non-confirmation of the bear market. Investors who followed this
    buy signal would have seen significant drawdowns during this bear market.

    Line traded sideways during the market decline of 2011, which was a buy signal.
    As well, it correctly warned of market weakness in 2015.

    as inconsistent and the timing of the signal uncertain. At a minimum, no investor
    would use breadth indicators in a trading system.

    with when they use breadth indicators.
