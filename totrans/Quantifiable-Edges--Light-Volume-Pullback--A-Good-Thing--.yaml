    market was due to pull back. The light volume is a sign that selling was not aggressive
    and should be viewed as a positive. The pullback appears orderly. It would seem
    buyers just stepped away. There doesn’t appear to be any heavy institutional distribution.*'

    they want the market to pull back on light volume. It’s in plenty of books so
    it must be true. Hmm…

    filled the void. Very light volume at the beginning of a pullback does NOT appear
    to be a good thing.
