    indeed profound to the core, right, wrong, sometimes short-sighted, but penetrating
    and still relevant to our situation today. Very much worth 20 minutes of your

    enormous cities. Capitalism has agglomerated population, centralised means of
    production, and has concentrated property in a few hands.

    self-interest, than callous ‘cash payment’.

- en: Capitalism has been the first to show what man’s activity can bring about. It
    has accomplished wonders far surpassing Egyptian pyramids, Roman aqueducts and
    Gothic cathedrals; it has conducted expeditions that put in the shade all former
    Exoduses of nations and crusades. Capitalism has created more massive and more
    colossal productive forces than have all preceding generations together.

- en: Capitalism cannot exist without constantly revolutionising the instruments of
    production, and thereby the means of production, and with them the whole relations
    of society. Constant revolutionising of production, uninterrupted disturbance
    of all social conditions, everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the
    capitalist epoch from all earlier ones. All old-established national industries
    have been destroyed or are daily being destroyed.

    new wants, requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and

    of the entire capitalist society. In these crises a great part not only of the
    existing products, but also of the previously created productive forces, are periodically
    destroyed.

- en: It’s hard not to conclude from these selected sentences that Marx was extraordinarily
    prescient. He really did have the most astonishing insight into the nature and
    trajectory and direction of capitalism. Three aspects which particularly stand
    out here are the tribute he pays to the productive capacity of capitalism, which
    far exceeds that of any other political-economic system we’ve ever seen; the remaking
    of social order which accompanies that; and capitalism’s inherent tendency for
    crisis, for cycles of boom and bust.
