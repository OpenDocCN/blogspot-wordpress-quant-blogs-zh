    is the NYSE McClellan Summation Index (NYSI). In the past, whenever the NYSI has
    fallen to an oversold extreme of -1000 or less, the indicator has rebounded so
    that the weekly stochastic bounced from an oversold to an overbought level. We
    are now overbought on the weekly stochastic.

    These conditions suggests that there may be one or two weeks of more upside on
    NYSI, this relief rally is running on borrowed time.
