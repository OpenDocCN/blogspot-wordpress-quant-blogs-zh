    passed away today.  His life was an incredible story of innovation, and the ability
    to triumph in the face of constant adversity. The legacy that he left cannot possibly
    be missed– you can’t walk outside or inside for more than a minute without seeing
    someone use an Apple product. There is literally no other consumer brand in the
    world that enjoys the same degree of loyalty and enthusiasm as Apple Computer.
    There is a good reason for that: Steve Jobs was focused on creating the best products
    with no compromises—even at the expense of delaying a launch in a world driven
    by quarterly earnings. Furthermore, he furnished these products with  functionality
    that consumers  didn’t know they needed until it was available. Jobs did not focus
    on market research and on providing customers with what they wanted, instead he
    brought them products from his unique vision of the future. It was the act of
    daring to be different, and focusing on value  instead of money that set Jobs
    and Apple far away from the competition.'

    by intense competition, technology and innovation. Of course, quantitative investing
    fits in perfectly within this category. So what can we learn from Steve Jobs?
    He was a man that wasn’t fond of rules or the status quo. Jobs would run his business
    based on his vision of how technology would evolve in the future rather than how
    it actually was in the present. He was willing to risk everything in order to
    best shape his products with this vision.  If he were in finance he would quickly
    recognize that greatest rewards will accrue to those that can create innovative
    algorithms or technology. It is very easy to imagine him seeing the value in a
    quantitative approach to investing.  Furthermore, Jobs would spend less time studying
    what others are doing in the field and focus on taking a completely novel approach.
    He would hire talent and promote risk-taking at every level of the organization.
    Furthermore he would invest extensively in research and development and avoid
    using a management accounting approach to evaluating its budget.

    duplicate this approach: 1) a  true lack of diverse and creative talent 2)a lack
    of  consistent commitment to an ongoing research and development 3) embedded philosophical
    barriers to innovation .  The first problem is driven by the type of “left-brained”
    people that are attracted to and consistently employed in finance:  math, engineering
    and physics. This makes sense because of the high intellectual and technical barriers
    that exist in modern quantitative finance. However, the saturation of Phds and
    math wizards creates a talent pool that often lacks both diversity and creativity.
    While it is true that creativity can come from any background, it is certainly
    less likely to come from those that have cognitive wiring that is the polar opposite
    of those people that are typically artistic and creative.'

    value of financial innovation unless one is committed to the process. It is easy
    to measure the value of programmers or the mathematicians that create core programs.
    In contrast, adding alpha requires incrementally longer time frames to evaluate
    accurately as the trading frequency becomes lower. However, evaluation is a critical
    part of business decisions to increase R&D expenditures. That explains why hedge
    funds,high frequency firms and investment banks continue to hire top scientists
    while the rest of the investment industry fails to invest in talent.

- en: A final achilles heel resides in the psychological, political, and philosophical
    barriers to innovation. In all areas of finance, the cost of miscalculation or
    being “wrong” is so high that human nature causes us to seek out those who are
    less likely to screw up the math. Having worked with many Phds and other bright
    individuals, the fear of being wrong or even doing math that is not conventional
    is so strong and pervasive that they are psychologically unwilling to break from
    convention. Of course, the very essence of the creative  process requires risking
    being incredibly wrong in order to find a better way to do something. This can
    mean that a quant can lose their job for introducing a novel idea that doesn’t
    pan out, but will probably keep their job if they use GARCH or Fama-French and
    mess up. Clearly between the type of employee that gets hired, fear of math mistakes,
    and  the obvious politics involved, innovation has many hurdles to overcome.

    alpha in  being conventional and avoiding mistakes. There is no such thing as
    the “right” way to do anything anymore. In quantum physics we are continually
    exposed to how little concrete information we truly possess. Why should a vastly
    more unpredictable field be any different? Determinism and mathematical proofs
    are rapidly losing their value in finance. There is no fixed reality, and the
    highly dimensional nature financial problems today require both tremendous statistical
    skills but also the unique and artistic insights that drive the hypotheses to
    be tested. The new brand of quant firms that will succeed will integrate both
    approaches under one roof.
