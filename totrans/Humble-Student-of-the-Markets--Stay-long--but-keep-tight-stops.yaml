    last week, but I believe that we are due for an oversold relief rally. We will
    need to watch how the market behaves in the next couple of weeks in order to truly
    determine whether an intermediate term top is in.

    are a number of worrisome negative divergences that shouldn't be ignored. For
    one, eurozone concerns are rising and the risk of financial contagion from Europe
    is rearing its ugly head again. European stocks have violated their uptrend and
    they have rolled over. The STOXX 600 Index, shown below, is now approaching the
