    amazed to learn retrospectively that as soon as I dialed back my posting, the
    popularity of the iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN ([VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX))
    surged and volume – which had never hit 4 million shares in 2009 – topped the
    4 million mark in 7 of the last 8 sessions.

    why people might think the VIX seems a little low at 17.91 (and at 16.86 a week
    ago), it is important to note that VIX January futures are now under 20.00 and
    in the context of historical volatility the VIX is actually somewhat elevated
    at current levels.

    does seen warranted given the macroeconomic risks. While some of this gut feeling
    may be the result of [Availability Bias and Disaster Imprinting](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/11/availability-bias-and-disaster.html),
    there are obviously other factors at work as well.

- en: In this week’s [chart of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week),
    I attempt to capture the price and volume history of VXX, with some of the prior
    major volatility surges highlighted with the blue vertical bars. The bottom line
    is that while previous VXX volume spikes did in some instances capture a trough
    just prior to an uptick in volatility, these were generally small moves of only
    3-5 days. Further, while VXX did tend to outperform for a week or more following
    a volume spike, on balance VXX long positions *still lost money* from one month
    to one day following a VXX volume spike. So, while there may be a small ‘smart
    money’ effect when VXX volume surges, the ‘smart money’ is essentially just losing
    money at a slower pace with VXX long positions.

    newsletter](http://vixandmoresubscriber.blogspot.com/), but readers should get
    the gist of my concerns in some of the blog posts linked below.
