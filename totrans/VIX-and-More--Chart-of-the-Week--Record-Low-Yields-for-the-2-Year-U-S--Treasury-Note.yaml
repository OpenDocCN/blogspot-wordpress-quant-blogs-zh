- en: As noted a week ago in [Revisiting the Flight-to-Safety Trade](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/06/revisiting-flight-to-safety-trade.html),
    there are a handful of ways in which to keep an eye on the pulse of investor anxiety.
    These include [U.S. Treasuries](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Treasury%20Note)
    (including the various ETFs, such as [TLT](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TLT),
    [IEF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/IEF) and [SHV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SHV)),
    the dollar ([UUP](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/UUP)), and gold
    ([GLD](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/GLD)). In terms of volatility,
    the preferred vehicles are the VIX, [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures)
    and [VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX).

- en: For the last two weeks or so, stocks have been under considerable pressure,
    yet the action in the dollar, gold and volatility have been relatively mild and
    far short of panic. One has to look at U.S. Treasuries to see signs of extreme
    anxiety in the charts. This week’s [chart of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week)
    below shows weekly bars of the yield on the 2-Year U.S. Treasury Note going back
    four years. The yield on the 2-Year Note reflects an amalgamation of several factors,
    including the Fed’s easy money policy, potential deflationary speculative plays
    and demand which results from the flight-to-safety trade when investors are fearful
    of owning stocks, commodities and other investment vehicles. While it is difficult
    to disaggregate the component influences on the yield, it is safe to say that
    the record low yields seen last week include an important flight-to-safety component
    and are an excellent proxy for investor fear and anxiety.

    [Impromptu VIX Talk](http://dailyoptionsreport.com/blog/post/impromptu-vix-talk/#When:14:16:13Z),
    where Adam Warner ([Daily Options Report](http://dailyoptionsreport.com/)) and
    I confirm that once again we have independently arrived at the same conclusions
    regarding volatility. [For those conspiracy theorists who wonder why we have never
    been seen in the same room, perhaps Adam's capture of our IM banter will quell
    thoughts of the ghost blogger typing away on the grassy knoll.]
