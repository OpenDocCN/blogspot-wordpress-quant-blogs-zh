    in output and employment. The unemployment rate rises an average of 7 percentage
    points over the down phase of the cycle, which lasts on average over four years.
    Output falls (from peak to trough) an average of over 9 percent, although the
    duration of the downturn, averaging roughly two years, is considerably shorter
    than for unemployment.

    of 86 percent in the major post–World War II episodes. Interestingly, the main
    cause of debt explosions is not the widely cited costs of bailing out and recapitalizing
    the banking system. Admittedly, bailout costs are difficult to measure, and there
    is considerable divergence among estimates from competing studies. But even upper-bound
    estimates pale next to actual measured rises in public debt. In fact, the big
    drivers of debt increases are the inevitable collapse in tax revenues that governments
    suffer in the wake of deep and prolonged output contractions, as well as often
    ambitious countercyclical fiscal policies aimed at mitigating the downturn.

    to be deeper and more severe. The IMF study indicated that average recession length

    then on average the recession will end in late 2009/early 2010\. Reinhart & Rogoff
    showed that equity prices had an average decline of 55% and the S&P 500 has neared
    that mark on a peak to trough basis.

    process. We should be prepared for a test or even small breakdown from the lows
    seen late last year, but the downside is limited. If the average recession ends
    in late 2009/early 2010, then the timing of the final bottom should occur sometime
    in 2Q or 3Q 2009.
