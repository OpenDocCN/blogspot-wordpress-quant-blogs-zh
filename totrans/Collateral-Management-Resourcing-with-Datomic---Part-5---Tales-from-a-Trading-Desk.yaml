    look at [Datomic](http://www.datomic.com/), even though the original plan was
    to use Neo4j from a repository perspective.¬† Datomic has for all intents and purposes
    a bi-temporal view of the world as I‚Äôve previous blogged.¬† For the exercise at
    hand, I went with the free [download](http://www.datomic.com/get-datomic.html),
    since this is very much a proof of concept (PoC).
