- en: I have always been fascinated by Donchian Channels as they were the core method
    used by the legendary turtle traders to achieve their success.  Channels are simply
    bands containing the “n” day high bounded by the “n” day low . They can be seen
    visually on [www.stockcharts.com](http://www.stockcharts.com)  using their sharp
    charts by selecting the “price channel.”  I noticed that the larger the channel
    that the stock is currently in, the more likely the trend was to continue. In
    my own work on ranking stocks, i include a % distance from 52-wk high as part
    of the momentum factor which does in fact add a fair amount of value to the overall
    score. Many systems using channels to trade a wide variety of futures and indexes
    are still robust, even during the new mean reversion era.

    exposure method to catching trends.** Wouldn’t it be smart to increase leverage
    and exposure as the move becomes confirmed? Most models are either all in or all
    out, that is why it is difficult to design short-term trend systems. The frequently incorrect
    signals given by shorter trend signals are too costly using a full bet size. More
    importantly, signals generated by short-term models  that are counter to the longer
    term trend are more likely to be incorrect or have a poor profit factor.'

    trade channels: Exits and entries are determined by new channel penetration. That
    is, a new 50-day high for example would initiate a new long position after a previous
    50-day low had been triggered without a 50-day high prior to that. Once a new
    entry is triggered, you would exit at a channel low that is **half of the original
    channel length**. That is, if you entered on a 20-day high, you would exit on
    a 10-day low, and so-on.'

    regarding channels:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 1) **the 200 day channel position dictates the main trend:** you will have to
    trace back on the chart to find the first penetration from long to short or vice
    versa to figure out what the main trend is.

- en: 2) smaller channels (a minimum of 20 days-5o days) can be used to trade within
    the main trend with less risk using a 2 ATR initial stop to minimize potential
    losses.

- en: '3) when trading counter to the prevailing trend, whatever the minimum channel
    length is in #2 you should use double that length as a trigger— so in this case
    to enter countertrend in bear markets you would use a 40-day channel, and the
    same applies to bull markets.'

    you are with the prevailing trend.

- en: 'Ok, that is the basic framework. Lets figure out how we can scale in and out
    of a trend using channels. It makes sense to bet less on small channels, and more
    on larger channels. Note that when trading countertrend, you would bet half of
    these amounts:'

    even when going counter to the main trend. I haven’t tested this out yet, as i
    have a long and large list. For anyone new to the blog…….this isn’t my core research
    area (designing stock rankings). But if you do test it out, let me know. I would
    be pleased to present your results.
