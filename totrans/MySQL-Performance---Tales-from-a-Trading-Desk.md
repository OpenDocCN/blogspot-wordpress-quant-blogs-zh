# MySQL Performance | Tales from a Trading Desk

## MySQL Performance

It’s a shame banks aren’t as open as Twitter and PayPal 🙂 itnews articles on PayPal offer a glimpse on the size/performance of the MySQL installations at both Twitter and now PayPal.

> Twitter uses MySQL as a “building block,” he said, “as a core of features we understand and functionality we trust”, upon which his team uses [Gizzard](https://github.com/twitter/gizzard#readme) for sharding and replication, [InnoDB](http://www.innodb.com/) as its storage system, and a NoSQL database called [FlockDB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FlockDB).
