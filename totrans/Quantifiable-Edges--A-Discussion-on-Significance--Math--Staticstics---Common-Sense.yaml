    on a sample set of data then a significance test can help you determine the probability
    of the perceived bias being due to chance. This is very helpful when deciding
    whether to factor the results of a certain study into your decision making.

    bias will continue at the same rate. It does mean that what occurred in the past
    was likely due to more than chance.

    Worden keeps the data) would have been profitable 17 out of 17 times. The extreme
    reading led to a bounce the next day. The bounce soon petered out though without
    breadth improving to the point where the oscillator (as measured by Worden) returned
    above 0\. At this point that system entry is almost a month old and it appears
    unlikely that is will close profitably. Does this mean the system doesn’t work?
    Nope. It probably will work well into the future. There is almost certainly an
    edge. What is certain is that the edge is not 100%.

    than just win %. The line I normally look at first in the results I publish is
    typically “Avg Trade”. Even if the indicator is only 50% (or less) accurate, do
    the times when it was right substantially outweigh those when it was wrong?

    market typically averages between 0.03% to 0.05% per day. This would equate to
    $30-$50 on my “$100,000 per trade" studies. If I find a study that averages $200/per
    day over a 5-10 day period, then that study is likely suggesting an edge.

    a large part in the evaluation process. If the system was wrong 10 times for an
    average loss of 0.5% and right once for a gain of 20%, looking at the “Average
    Trade” isn’t going to tell the whole story. The outlier has largely skewed the
    results. For reasons of space and aesthetics I don’t always show the “Max Gain”
    or “Max Loss” columns. If I do you can be sure I consider them important.

    you need to endure in losses in order to make a certain amount of gains. The formula
    is Gross Gains / Gross Losses. In general, a system that makes $1000 from $1,200
    in profits and $200 in losses is preferable to a system that makes $1000 from
    $20,000 in profits and $19,000 in losses. Therefore a higher profit factor is
    generally more desirable.

    meaningful statistics from. This does not mean the study isn’t valuable or can’t
    teach us something. In fact, many times the lack of instances may in itself be
    a warning sign. If the market is behaving in a way that it either never or only
    a small number of times has acted in the past, I find that noteworthy. I want
    to know when the market is in uncharted territory. For me that may signify some
    extra caution is warranted.

    number of instances found are noteworthy or compelling in some way. An example

- en: As a last point, taking a mathematical approach to the market can help to provide
    a "quantifable edge". It will never be a perfect edge, though. While the math
    and the calculations may be perfect, the market isn’t. The market is heavily influenced
    by emotion. A common sense approach to the numbers is necessary. Otherwise, those
    times when the market acts in a way that is mathematically 99.999% unlikely, (but
    realistically more common), then trading accounts could suffer incredible drawdowns
    and damage. The studies may be my guide…but I’m still driving.
