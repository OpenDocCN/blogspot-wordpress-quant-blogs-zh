    Worth noting is his use of [logistic regression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression)
    to predict *probabilistic direction* of next period spreads based upon *residuals*
    calculated from a linear model of the historical spread. In other words, Paul
    is evaluating the following logical hypothesis (synthesized from p. 5):'

- en: This methodology is particularly interesting as it is *equally applicable to
    many other financial instruments*, provided suitable notions of “mispricings”
    and value estimators. For example, directional prediction of co-integrated pairs
    can be similarly estimated, extending the analysis introduced in [Mean Reversion](https://quantivity.wordpress.com/2009/07/19/mean-reversion/).
