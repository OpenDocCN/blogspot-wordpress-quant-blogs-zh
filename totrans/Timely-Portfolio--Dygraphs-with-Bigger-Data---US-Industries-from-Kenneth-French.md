# Timely Portfolio: Dygraphs with Bigger Data | US Industries from Kenneth French

> 来源：[http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2013/11/dygraphs-with-bigger-data-us-industries.html#0001-01-01](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2013/11/dygraphs-with-bigger-data-us-industries.html#0001-01-01)

After seeing the announcement by [@lauraegerdal](https://twitter.com/lauraegerdal) of the SEC’s use of [dygraphs](http://dygraphs.com) to visualize [market structure](http://www.sec.gov/marketstructure/datavis.html#.UoZe-hqsiM5), I was inspired to experiment more with the great dygraphs + rCharts.  I really wanted to see how responsive dygraphs would be with a fairly large dataset.  Some [Kenneth French](http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html) US Industry data seemed just big enough to get a good feel for dygraph’s digestive abilities.  See it in action [here](http://timelyportfolio.github.io/rCharts_dygraphs_posts/biggerdata.html) or click on the screenshot below.
