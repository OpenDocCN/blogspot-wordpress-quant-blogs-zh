    also known as the Arms Index, after its inventor, [Dick Arms](http://www.armsinsider.com/).

    in price by the number of stocks that declined in price to determine the Advance/Decline
    Ratio. Next, the volume of advancing stocks is divided by the volume of declining
    stocks to determine the Upside/Downside Ratio.  Finally, the Advance/Decline Ratio
    is divided by the Upside/Downside Ratio.  In mathematical terms, the TRIN looks
    like:'

    a rising TRIN indicates increasing bearish sentiment and a falling TRIN reflects
    increasing bullish sentiment.  I have included the traditional 1.2 and 0.8 thresholds
    as indicative of sentiment extremes.  These are levels at which the probability
    of a market reversal increases.

    the TRIN.  In the chart below, I chose to use 60 minute bars over the course of
    a two month period to generate swing signals of the short to intermediate-term
    variety.  For comparison purposes, day traders frequently use 5 or 10 minute bars.  It
    is important to note that different length bars give very different signals and
    also usually require a rethinking of where one should place the threshold levels
    for market turns.

    most bullish signal since Thanksgiving, when the markets began a strong rally
    that surprised many who were not watching the TRIN closely.
