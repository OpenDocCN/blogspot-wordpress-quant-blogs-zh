    a model is better the more unrealistic its assumptions, and that the sole measure
    of a theory is making accurate predictions. I'd really like to know what DeLong
    thinks on this, but his views aren't there in the interview. He mentions Friedman's
    idea but doesn't defend or attack it, just a reference to one of the most influential
    ideas on this topic, I guess. Shows how much Friedman's view is still in play.

- en: ) the core problem with Friedman's argument is that a theory with perfect predictions
    and perfectly unrealistic assumptions simply doesn't teach you anything -- you're
    left just as mystified by how the model can possibly work (give the right predictions)
    as you were with the original phenomena you set out to explain. It's like a miracle.
    Such a model might of course be valuable as a starting point, and in stimulating
    the invention of further models with more realistic assumptions which then --
    if they give the same predictions -- may indeed teach you something about how
    certain kinds of interactions, behaviours, etc (in the assumptions) can lead to
    observed consequences.

    (It's worth remembering that Friedman liked to say provocative things even if
    he didn't quite believe them.)

- en: Modeling is not the end-all and the be-all of economics... The notion that the
    qualities of an economist should be defined by the modeling style that they adopt
    [is a disaster]. There is a group of people who say that if you're not doing dynamic
    stochastic general equilibrium modeling then you're not really a modern economist...
    that's a preposterous position which is going to lead to the reduction of economics
    to the equivalent of a small religious cult working on issues of interest to no
    one else in the world.
