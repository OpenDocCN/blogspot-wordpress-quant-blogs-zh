    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. Past trading of
    the trading model has shown turnover rates of about 200% per month.

    computers with punched cards), I learned the principles of market cycle analysis
    from a grizzled veteran of technical analysis. Markets are said to move in cycles.

- en: Here is how an idealized cycle works. In the initial phase of an expansion,
    central banks lower rates to boost the economy, and the market leaders are the
    interest sensitive stocks. As the cycle matures, leadership rotates into consumer
    stocks, followed by capacity expansion, which leads to capital goods sector leadership.
    The late phase of the cycle is characterized by tight capacity and rising inflation,
    which is an environment where asset plays and commodity extraction industries
    outperform.

    parallel economic cycles, they are different. Market undergo mini-cycles of changes
    in sentiment whose length are much shorter than economic cycles. Nevertheless,
    the broad principles of market cycle analysis remain valid today.

    a sector review from a market cycle analytical framework would be a good change
