    lowest volume since the July 3rd holiday-shortened session. When the market moves
    up, you’d normally rather see it occur on strong volume. Exceptionally weak volume,
    like we saw today, has been followed by some difficult market conditions over

- en: One additional thought on volume for the back half of August. Over the next
    two weeks it is probable that volume will drop off due to traders taking vacations.
    When monitoring volume, shorter-term comparisons may need to be made to gain value
    from the information. For example, rather than comparing volume to its 50-day
    average, you may get a truer indication by comparing it to the last 1-3 days.
