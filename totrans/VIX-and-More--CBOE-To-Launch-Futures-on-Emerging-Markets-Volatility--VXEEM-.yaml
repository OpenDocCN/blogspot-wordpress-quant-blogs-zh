    labeled “[atomic volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/atomic%20volatility)”
    (a lessening of the scope of the underlying for options contracts and/or the duration
    of those contracts) would accelerate.

    futures based on the gold volatility index ([GVZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/GVZ)),
    which was [launched](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/GVZ) back in
    August 2008, at the same time as the euro volatility index ([EVZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EVZ))
    and several weeks after the launch of the [OVX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/07/cboe-launches-oil-vix-ovx.html),
    known affectionately as “the Oil VIX.” *[Those who are interested in the sequencing
    of the launch of various volatility measures should refer to [The Evolution of
    the Volatility Index Family Tree](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/08/evolution-of-volatility-index-family.html).]*

- en: Now the CBOE is taking the next step with VXEEM, the volatility index that is
    based on the popular [emerging markets](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/emerging%20markets)
    ETF ([EEM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EEM)), and offering futures
    on that index. The launch of these futures contracts is set for January 9^(th)
    and will initially include contracts with expirations in February, March, April
    and May. Note that the expiration cycles for these contracts are the same as those
    for the VIX futures and options, meaning that they will expire on Wednesdays (February
    15, March 21, April 18 and May 16) and can last be traded on the Tuesday immediately
    following the expiration. For more information, check out the CBOE’s VXEEM [splash
    page](http://www.cboe.com/micro/VIXETF/VXEEM/) and [information circular](http://www.cfe.cboe.com/publish/CFEinfocirc/CFEIC11-079.pdf).

- en: One of the reasons I think products based on EEM and VXEEM have a good chance
    of being successful is that emerging markets are typically a highly volatile area
    – much more so than the basket of stocks included in the S&P 500 index on which
    the VIX is based. Right now, for instance, EEM has a 60-day historical volatility
    that is more than 50% higher than that of the SPX. All this means that short-term
    traders should find VXEEM products (futures as well as options and ETPs, assuming
    they are in the pipeline) to be the types of high-octane trading vehicles that
    are well-suited to some of their favorite strategies, much like leveraged ETPs
    and VIX-based products.

- en: Additionally, as the chart below reminds us, emerging markets sometimes move
    in cycles that are distinct from U.S. stocks. Note that the ratio of EEM to SPX
    has varied wildly over the course of the past five years and has had different
    bottoms and tops than the SPX has. Whether this phenomenon will continue into
    the future (influenced strongly by [China](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/China))
    remains to be seen, but the role of emerging markets relative to developed markets
    should be watched closely in 2012\.
