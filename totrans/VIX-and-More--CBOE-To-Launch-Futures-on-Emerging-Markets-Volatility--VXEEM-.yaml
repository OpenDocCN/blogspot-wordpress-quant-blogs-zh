    (a lessening of the scope of the underlying for options contracts and/or the duration
    of those contracts) would accelerate.

    futures based on the gold volatility index ([GVZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/GVZ)),
    which was [launched](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/GVZ) back in
    August 2008, at the same time as the euro volatility index ([EVZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EVZ))
    and several weeks after the launch of the [OVX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/07/cboe-launches-oil-vix-ovx.html),
    known affectionately as “the Oil VIX.” *[Those who are interested in the sequencing
    of the launch of various volatility measures should refer to [The Evolution of
    the Volatility Index Family Tree](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/08/evolution-of-volatility-index-family.html).]*

- en: Now the CBOE is taking the next step with VXEEM, the volatility index that is
    based on the popular [emerging markets](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/emerging%20markets)
    ETF ([EEM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EEM)), and offering futures
    on that index. The launch of these futures contracts is set for January 9^(th)
    and will initially include contracts with expirations in February, March, April
    and May. Note that the expiration cycles for these contracts are the same as those
    for the VIX futures and options, meaning that they will expire on Wednesdays (February
    15, March 21, April 18 and May 16) and can last be traded on the Tuesday immediately
    following the expiration. For more information, check out the CBOE’s VXEEM [splash
    page](http://www.cboe.com/micro/VIXETF/VXEEM/) and [information circular](http://www.cfe.cboe.com/publish/CFEinfocirc/CFEIC11-079.pdf).

  zh: 现在，CBOE正在通过VXEEM这个基于流行的新兴市场ETF（[EEM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EEM)）的波动指数采取下一步行动，并为此指数提供期货。这些期货合约的推出定于1月9日，并将最初包括2月、3月、4月和5月到期的合约。请注意，这些合约的到期周期与VIX期货和期权相同，这意味着它们将在星期三到期（2月15日、3月21日、4月18日和5月16日），并且可以在到期前的星期二最后交易。更多信息，请查看CBOE的VXEEM[主页](http://www.cboe.com/micro/VIXETF/VXEEM/)和[信息公告](http://www.cfe.cboe.com/publish/CFEinfocirc/CFEIC11-079.pdf)。
- en: One of the reasons I think products based on EEM and VXEEM have a good chance
    of being successful is that emerging markets are typically a highly volatile area
    – much more so than the basket of stocks included in the S&P 500 index on which
    the VIX is based. Right now, for instance, EEM has a 60-day historical volatility
    that is more than 50% higher than that of the SPX. All this means that short-term
    traders should find VXEEM products (futures as well as options and ETPs, assuming
    they are in the pipeline) to be the types of high-octane trading vehicles that
    are well-suited to some of their favorite strategies, much like leveraged ETPs
    and VIX-based products.

  zh: 我认为基于EEM和VXEEM的产品有可能成功的一个原因在于，新兴市场通常波动性很高——远比构成标普500指数的股票篮子要高得多，而VIX就是基于这个指数的。例如，目前EEM的60天历史波动率比SPX高出超过50%。这意味着短期交易者可能会发现VXEEM产品（包括期货、期权和ETP，假设它们已经在研发中）是适合他们某些喜爱策略的高性能交易工具，就像杠杆ETP和VIX基础产品一样。
- en: Additionally, as the chart below reminds us, emerging markets sometimes move
    in cycles that are distinct from U.S. stocks. Note that the ratio of EEM to SPX
    has varied wildly over the course of the past five years and has had different
    bottoms and tops than the SPX has. Whether this phenomenon will continue into
    the future (influenced strongly by [China](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/China))
    remains to be seen, but the role of emerging markets relative to developed markets
    should be watched closely in 2012\.

  zh: 此外，如下图所示，新兴市场有时会与美国股票呈现出不同的周期性走势。注意EEM与SPX的比率在过去五年中波动很大，并且与SPX的底部和顶部不同。这种现象是否会在未来持续（受到[中国](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/China)的强烈影响）还有待观察，但2012年相对于发达市场，新兴市场的角色应该受到密切关注。
