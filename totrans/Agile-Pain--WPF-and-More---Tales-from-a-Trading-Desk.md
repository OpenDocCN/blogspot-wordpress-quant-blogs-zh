## Agile Pain, WPF and More

I see [vsts process](http://blogs.msdn.com/processblog/archive/2007/09/12/fragile-agile.aspx) recently blogged about “Fragile Agile”. I still find it amazing that with the number of books/blogs available, “agile” projects still fail to get the basic fundementals correct. Then again I suppose given that there are projects in development that lack basic [OO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_design) design concepts (e.g. make all class variables protected), maybe I shouldn’t be that amazed anymore.

I’m glad to see Silverlight 1.1 is finally getting a few [controls](http://blogs.msdn.com/gduthie/archive/2007/09/12/silverlight-1-1-gets-input-controls-in-latest-refresh.aspx). How long before we get data binding?

Beatriz has a nice posting on [TreeView](http://www.beacosta.com/2007/09/are-there-any-tricks-that-will-help-me_2888.html) performance, touching on the subject on data/UI virtualization. Virtualization within WPF controls is extemely important when it comes to deal with the quantity/frequency of certain types of trading data. If your learning WPF, check out [WPF Tutorials](http://wpf-tutorials.livejournal.com/), its also worth reading Box Clever’s WPF Listbox [posting](http://blogs.vbcity.com/xtab/archive/2007/09/07/8683.aspx).

[Nicholas](http://blogs.msdn.com/drnick/archive/2007/09/07/wcf-performance-comparisons.aspx) blogs about WCF Performance Comparison whitepaper. The WCF vs .NET Remoting number are probably useful to a lot of people wanting to justify a move to WCF.

Since the [.NET Meetup](http://dotnet.meetup.com/121/) is around the corner, its probably worth having a read of Noah’s Linq [posting](http://blogs.msdn.com/noahc/archive/2007/09/10/a-little-linq.aspx).

I came across [Microsoft Advanced Windows Debugging and Troubleshooting](http://blogs.msdn.com/ntdebugging/archive/2007/09/10/lpc-part-3-debugging-a-real-world-lpc-scenario.aspx) blog recently which contains a number of interesting postings – Windows Startup, Shutdown etc.
