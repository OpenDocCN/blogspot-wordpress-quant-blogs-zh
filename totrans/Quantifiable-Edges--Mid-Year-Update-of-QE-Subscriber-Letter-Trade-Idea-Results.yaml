- en: I don't often discuss trade idea results from the subscriber letter here on
    the blog. The last time I did was in January. 2012 so far has been a very strong
    year and many subscribers have written to say they’ve benefitted.  The reason
    I don’t often post results is that while I've always tracked trade ideas in the
    subscriber letter, it isn't the main focus of the service. I don't consider Quantifiable
    Edges to be a stock picking service. I consider it one where traders can gain
    market and trading knowledge through the published research, systems, and tools.
    The objective is to provide tools and instruction to help traders improve their
    own trading and results.

- en: It is important to note that all of the trade ideas are in either ETFs or in
    highly liquid large cap stocks (almost exclusively S&P 100 components). I do this
    so that executing trades and getting fills at reasonable prices is not an issue.
    I think traders feel the most frustrating aspect of following trade ideas offered
    by some services is not being able to get into or out of the trades that they
    suggest at a similar price. I’ve addressed this problem with limit prices and
    highly liquid securities.

  zh: 需要指出的是，所有的交易想法都是关于ETFs或者高度流动的大型股票（几乎完全是标普100的成分股）。我这样做是为了确保执行交易和以合理的价格获得填充不是问题。我认为交易者跟随着某些服务提供的交易想法最沮丧的方面是不能以类似的价格进入或退出他们建议的交易。我通过限价和高度流动的证券解决了这个问题。

    occasionally when a big trades lasts over a month or year-end.

    and instruction to improve their trading. These ideas may come in the form of
    previously published studies identified by the Quantifinder, or they may be something
    I discuss in the current subscriber letter, or perhaps it's a webinar focused
    on a certain trading approach or indicator, or any other number of tools that
    I've designed and made available. (For a more complete list of tools, see the
    "Using Quantifiable Edges" series of posts.) The trade ideas found in the subscriber
    letter are examples of how I put these tools and ideas to work. While past performance
    is not necessarily indicative of future results, over the long run they’ve performed
    well enough that many subscribers have used them for their benefit.

  zh: 最后，以下是交易想法结果电子表格中的解释和免责声明。
- en: '*All trade ideas ever tracked in the Quantifiable Edges Subscriber Letter may
    be found on this spreadsheet. I don’t suggest position sizes. The primary reason
    for this is I’m not acting as a financial advisor. I don’t feel it is appropriate
    to suggest allocation sizes without understanding someone’s financial situation
    and risk tolerance. Even for my own trading I run different portfolios with different
    levels of aggressiveness. For instance, my most aggressive may use options to
    sometimes get 300-400% leveraged. Other portfolios on the other hand normally
    take much more conservative stances and some rarely reach or exceed 100% exposure.**Since
    I don’t suggest position sizes this is should not be considered a performance
    report, but rather a trade idea scorecard. Therefore, no matter how objective
    I try to be the reporting of the results is always going to be skewed depending
    on how you approach the trades. For instance, I always recommend scaling into
    the Catapult positions in 3 parts, whereas the “System” trades (whatever system
    I unveil other than Catapult) are normally one entry. The “Index” trades I normally
    recommend scaling into as well. For my own trading I trade much larger size with
    the index trades than any of the individuals. I also control my exposure by limiting
    the total amount invested per day. As I mentioned, this will vary depending on
    the account I’m trading. My most aggressive account I may put in up to 100%/day
    and get heavily leveraged using options. A more conservative account may max out
    at 15%-20% per day.**It’s unlikely anyone would have taken all of the trades with
    equal amounts, so personal results would vary greatly depending on the trader’s
    approach. Simply adding up the results of the individual triggers as I do is an
    admittedly poor representation of returns. A net positive or negative does not
    necessarily mean a person following the ideas would have made or lost money during
    the period measured. And the sum total is certainly not representative of what
    a portfolio would return. **Feel free to contact me at support @ QuantifiableEdges.com
    if you have any questions.**As required by the NFA: Except where otherwise specifically
    stated, all trades are based on hypothetical or simulated trading. Hypothetical
    or simulated performance results have certain inherent limitations. Unlike an
    actual performance record, simulated results do not represent actual trading.
    Also, since the trades have not actually been executed, the results may have under-or-over-compensated
    for the impact, if any, of certain market factors, such as lack of liquidity.
    Simulated trading programs in general are also subject to the fact that they are
    designed with the benefit of hindsight. No representation is being made that any
    account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown.

  zh: 所有在Quantifiable Edges订阅信中跟踪过的交易想法都可以在这个电子表格中找到。我不建议确定头寸大小。这主要是因为我没有充当财务顾问的角色。我觉得在没有了解某人的财务状况和风险承受能力的情况下建议分配大小是不恰当的。即便是我自己的交易，我也运行着不同激进程度的多个投资组合。例如，我最激进的投资组合有时会使用期权来实现300-400%的杠杆。另一方面，其他投资组合通常采取更加保守的立场，有些很少达到或超过100%的敞口。**由于我不建议确定头寸大小，这不应该被认为是一个业绩报告，而是一个交易想法的记分卡。因此，不管我如何努力保持客观，结果的汇报总是取决于你如何处理交易。例如，我总是建议分三次进入Catapult头寸，而“系统”交易（除了Catapult之外的任何我揭示的系统）通常是一次性进入。我通常也建议对“指数”交易进行分批进入。与我个人的交易相比，我在指数交易中的交易量要大得多。我还通过限制每天投资的总金额来控制我的敞口。如我所说，这将根据我交易的账户而有所不同。在我最激进的账户中，我可能会每天投入高达100%，并使用期权进行高度杠杆操作。一个更加保守的账户可能每天最多达到15%-20%。**很可能没有人会以相等金额采取所有交易，因此个人结果将根据交易者的方法大不相同。仅仅像我那样把个别触发器的成果加起来，公认是一种对回报的拙劣表示。正负净额不一定意味着在衡量期间遵循想法的人会赚或亏钱。而且总计当然不代表投资组合的回报。**如果你有任何问题，请随时通过support
    @ QuantifiableEdges.com与我联系。**根据NFA的要求：除非另有特定声明，所有交易都是基于假设或模拟交易。假设或模拟的表现结果具有一些固有的局限性。与实际的表现记录不同，模拟结果不代表实际交易。此外，由于交易实际上并未执行，结果可能未对任何市场因素的影响进行充分或过度的补偿，例如流动性的缺乏。一般的模拟交易程序也受到这样一个事实的限制，即它们是在
    hindsight 的好处下设计的。没有做出任何账户将或可能实现与所示相似的利润或亏损的陈述。佣金、费用和滑点未包含在内。这既不是购买/出售证券或列出期权的邀请。*
