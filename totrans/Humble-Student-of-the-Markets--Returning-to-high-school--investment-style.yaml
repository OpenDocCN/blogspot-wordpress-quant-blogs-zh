    what line of work we choose for ourselves, is that we never really want to leave
    high school. Let me explain: We would rather not go through the emotional pain
    again of being a freshman in a senior-dominated world. We like the feeling, once
    we have made it, of being one of the cool kids, and will actively promote it and
    behave in such a way that reassures that we never “start over”. In the world that
    I live in, managing people’s money and investing it in assets, there are many
    sets of cool kids – the bond managers, the equity managers, the currency kings,
    and so on. I have a strong professional history in equities (stocks), while others
    have a strong background in bonds (fixed income), currencies (e.g. US dollars
    vs. Japanese yen), or commodities (bets on future price swings of things like
    oil, natural gas, or corn).'

    grows more and more accomplished in a major field of the markets, say equities
    in my case, one would also become an expert on all things markets-related, like
    bonds and currencies and commodities as they are all connected to each other.
    However, the opposite really happens, because most of us never want to feel like
    a freshman again. It’s painful to start at ground zero, knowing nothing, how things
    move, and why they move the way they do. One must ask dumb-sounding questions
    to get going in accumulating a fresh knowledge base***, and when you’re a highly
    respected specialist in the field you have mastered, this is a huge psychological
    barrier to becoming fluent in other asset classes. ***The equity managers I know
    have a very shallow understanding of how bonds trade, and most bond managers do
    not pay more attention to equities than noting the performance of the SP 500\.***
    These managers are very smart people, by any measure. This condition goes beyond
    asset managers – I have rarely met “in real life” an accomplished economist who
    can invest with great success. There are very few. The opposite applies to managers
    in markets – they are typically terrible economists.

    Treasury ETF (TLT). As the chart below shows, the HYG-TLT ratio (in purple) started
    to roll over in January, while the stock market (in black) continued to advance.
    This analysis suggests a negative divergence that represents a warning of declining

    factor than the second. As the bottom panel shows, the yield of the long Treasury
    bond has been declining since January and coincides with the underperformance
    of HYG against TLT.

    risk appetite as duration risk between the two ETFs have been minimized. The relative
    uptrend of HYG to IEI was broken and turned down only this month, not in January
    as the HYG-TLT ratio showed. This broken relative uptrend represents an early
    warning of declining risk appetite that needs to be watched and confirmed by other
    indicators. The downturn in the HYG-TLT ratio was a false alarm.
