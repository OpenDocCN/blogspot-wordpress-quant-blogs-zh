    shares on the NYSE were considered to be big volume days. Institutional execution
    was done in the upstairs market by brokerage block traders calling around their
    accounts: “we have 100,000 XYZ for sale, do you have any interest?”'

    It began with algos trading VWAP (volume weighted average price) orders. With
    the advent of day trading automation inevitably followed and today you can find
    specialized trading bots on the internet and even floor brokers are now using
    algos (see

    for individual investors for very low cost. Given the widespread adoption of these
    algos, don’t you think that someone could write a pattern recognition program
    to watch for a VWAP algo buying or selling a stock? This information is worth
    something to someone. As a trader once told me, portfolio insurance program trading
    (that exacerbated the Crash of 1987) was a huge boon to him because you knew that
    once the portfolio insurer had started the trading program he had more orders
    behind it.
