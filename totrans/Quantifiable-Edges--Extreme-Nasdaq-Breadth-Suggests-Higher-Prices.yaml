- en: While most everything did well on Thursday, much of the excitement was directed
    towards smallcaps and Nasdaq stocks. Below is a little study that shows how the
    market has performed in the past following such buying interest in the Nasdaq
    while the S&P 500 was in a long-term uptrend.

- en: Instances are lower than I’d typically like to see, but with all 7 closing higher
    in the next day or 2, this study appears worth noting. Extremely strong volume
    breadth going into riskier Nasdaq stocks has often led to some follow through
    when the market is in a long-term uptrend.

    as well...
