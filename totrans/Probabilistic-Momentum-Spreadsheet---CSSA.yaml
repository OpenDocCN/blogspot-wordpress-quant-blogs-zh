    "Are Simple Momentum Strategies Too Dumb? Introducing Probabilistic Momentum"),
    I introduced the concept of viewing momentum as  a probability of one asset outperforming
    the other versus a binary decision driven by whichever return is greater between
    a pair of assets. This method incorporates the joint distribution between two
    assets that factors in their variance and covariance. The difference in the two
    mean returns are compared to the tracking error between two assets to compute
    the information ratio. This ratio is then converted to a probability via the t-distribution
    to provide a more intelligent confidence-based buffer to avoid costly switching.
     A good article by Corey Hoffstein at Newfound discusses a related concept [here](http://blog.thinknewfound.com/managing-whipsaw-risks-by-measuring-potential-changes-to-tracking-error/).
     Many readers have inquired about a spreadsheet example for probabilistic momentum
    which can be found here : [probabilistic momentum worksheet](https://cssanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/probabilistic-momentum-worksheet.xlsx).
