From a pro-Obama

quoting Obama speeches:

 Obama: "You would think (my critics) would say

**maybe some**

rules and regulations are necessary to protect the economy..."

 The idea that the debate is between no regulation vs. good ones is a caricature, but it's the conviction of many. These people have no understanding of how many different rules exist, and that there's a difference between less regulation and zero.  As regulations proliferate it's impossible to enforce them all fairly, and so enforcement becomes selective and capricious. Legislative micromanagement is the road to crony capitalism, why so many senior risk managers at large private institutions are ex- government officials with some connections with the regulators.
