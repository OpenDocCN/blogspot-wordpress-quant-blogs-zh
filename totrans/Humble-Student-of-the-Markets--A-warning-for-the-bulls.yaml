    to add a few more of my own. While I don't have ten items, here is what is bothering

    deteriorated through a relative uptrend in May and are now in a relative downtrend.
    This is not the picture of a robust economic recovery.

    a lot like the relative chart of the cyclicals - a relative downtrend within an
    inverted saucer top formation. Without leadership from the Financials, can a new
    upleg be launched?

    "inflation" signal. I would tend to discount that signal and remain in "neutral"
    because of the anomolous condition of strong commodity prices and falling bond
    yields.

- en: As I've emphasized in recent weeks, the U.S. economy is still in a normal "lag
    window" between deterioration in leading measures of economic activity and (probable)
    deterioration in coincident measures. Though the lags are sometimes variable,
    as we saw in 1974 and 2008, ***normal lags would suggest an abrupt softening in
    the September ISM report (due in the beginning of October***), ***with new claims
    for unemployment softening beginning somewhere around mid-October***. It's possible
    that the historically tight relationships that we've reviewed iin recent weeks
    will not hold in this particular instance, but we have no reasonable basis to
    expect that. Indeed, if we look at the drivers of economic growth outside of the
    now fading impact of government stimulus spending, we continue to observe little
    intrinsic activity.

    easing should the economy show signs of further weakness - and that should put
    a floor on any stock market decline. In the interim, however, the bulls may have
    to suffer through a growth scare before the Fed rides to the rescue.
