    This is not the picture of a robust economic recovery.

    "inflation" signal. I would tend to discount that signal and remain in "neutral"
    because of the anomolous condition of strong commodity prices and falling bond
    yields.

- en: As I've emphasized in recent weeks, the U.S. economy is still in a normal "lag
    window" between deterioration in leading measures of economic activity and (probable)
    deterioration in coincident measures. Though the lags are sometimes variable,
    as we saw in 1974 and 2008, ***normal lags would suggest an abrupt softening in
    the September ISM report (due in the beginning of October***), ***with new claims
    for unemployment softening beginning somewhere around mid-October***. It's possible
    that the historically tight relationships that we've reviewed iin recent weeks
    will not hold in this particular instance, but we have no reasonable basis to
    expect that. Indeed, if we look at the drivers of economic growth outside of the
    now fading impact of government stimulus spending, we continue to observe little
    intrinsic activity.

  zh: 正如我最近几周强调的那样，美国经济仍处于经济活动领先指标恶化和（可能的）经济同时指标恶化之间的正常“滞后窗口”。虽然滞后有时会变化，正如我们在1974年和2008年看到的那样，***正常的滞后会提示九月ISM报告（预计于十月初发布）出现急剧放缓，而新的失业救济申请开始在十月中旬左右出现放缓***。可能的是，我们最近几周审视的经济增长驱动因素在这一特定情况下不会保持紧密的关系，但我们没有合理的依据来期望这种情况。实际上，如果我们看到政府刺激支出现在消退对经济增长的影响以外的经济增长驱动因素，我们会继续观察到很少的内在活动。
