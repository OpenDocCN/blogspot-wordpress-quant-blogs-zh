- en: In last night’s Subscriber Letter I looked at the breakout to a new closing
    high in the S&P 500\. I defined a breakout to be a close at a 50-day high after
    having no closes at a 50-day high for at least 10 days. In general these breakouts
    showed positive momentum for about a week and then fizzled out. I broke down the
    breakouts a number of different ways. One way was by using volume. I wanted to
    test the common supposition that high volume was better when an index broke out.
    Those results were quite interesting and I’ve included them below. First instances
    like yesterday with lower NYSE volume.

    week. But how does this compare to those times that the volume came in higher
    on the day of the breakout?

    times on this blog I’ve shown how common trading knowledge is often wrong. This
    serves as yet another example of why it is important to question common knowledge.
