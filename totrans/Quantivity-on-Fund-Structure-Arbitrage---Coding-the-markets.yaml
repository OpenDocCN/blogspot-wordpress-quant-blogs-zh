    from Quantivity – I’m hoping for more on the same topic from him. Many of the
    advantages listed would be enjoyed by any small non real money fund: hedge, prop,
    family office etc. Of course there are some serious obstacles that small (relatively)
    unregulated funds face, and Lars Kroijer describes them in detail in [Money Mavericks](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Money-Mavericks-Confessions-Manager-Financial/dp/027373198X).
    And a lack of legacy technology is indeed an advantage in building trading systems
    quickly. A relatively recent pre existing framework, either from vendor or in
    house built can be a big advantage though. A classic example is gateways for exchange/ECN
    connectivity.'
