- en: The last 3 days have created an interesting setup.  Thursday SPY made a new
    50-day closing high.  Friday SPY posted an inside day.  And then Monday was another
    50-day closing high.  This has only happened 16 other times since 1999\.  Below
    is a list of all the instances along with their performance the next day.

- en: Risk/reward here heavily favors the short side. The average drawdown is nearly
    4 times the size the average run-up. Also notable is that every instance saw drawdown
    of at least 0.35% the next day, but only 1 of the 16 instances saw run-up of at
    least 0.35%.  Futures are up 2.5 points right now about an hour before the open,
    but there may be some headwinds based on this pattern.
