    I need to beat up on Microsoft for not letting you author .NET-based WMI providers
    that allow method invocation and property setters. All you can do with .NET WMI
    providers are receive events and do property gets. You cannot change a value through
    a property setting, nor can you manage an application by calling a method on a
    provider.

    to drop down to COM (even using ATL) and C++.

    be managed by a .NET provider. This means that, if I want to write a monitoring
    and management dashboard (for monitoring, let's say, a .NET-based trading system),
    I have to drag out my old COM/ATL books and write unmanaged code. Ugh!
