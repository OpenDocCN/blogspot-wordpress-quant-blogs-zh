# ESB: Where? | Tales from a Trading Desk

## ESB: Where?

Elton Stoneman blogs about the [ESB](http://geekswithblogs.net/EltonStoneman/archive/2008/04/06/microsoft-esb-guidance-getting-started--installation.aspx). I‚Äôve yet to come across the ESB within an investment banks. Most of the banks either have home grown enterprise buses, or have existing products (Tibco etc). Anyone done a bake-off between ESB and [Tibco](http://www.tibco.com/software/enterprise_service_bus/default.jsp)? Looks like Microsoft really needs to consider adding a [comet](http://www.lightstreamer.com/) adapter to its ESB framework üòâ
