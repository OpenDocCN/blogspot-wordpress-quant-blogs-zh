    cross my knees in such a way that the screen will be propped up in a way that
    I can see it. I am going to Spain for the last two weeks in July, so right before
    I go, I will send the laptop off for repair. I estimate the repair cost to be
    about $300\. I cannot believe that HP makes a complete line of laptops whose hinges
    crack after a few months, and are so arrogant and uncompromising when it comes
    to addressing this issue.)

    have interviewed candidates in the past where, in the middle of an interview,
    they pull out a stack of printed source code and show it to me as proof of their
    coding ability.

    they want to keep a copy for posterity sake. They might not ever want to use it
    again. They just want a memento of what they have written. There is no malfeasance
    intended.

    And, if you bring your old source to a new company, you are putting your new company
    in a precarious situation. And, if you decide to work on any other projects in
    your spare time, make sure that you check your employment contract very carefully
    ... some companies say that anything you write during your term of employment
    belongs to them, even if you write it in your off-hours at home.
