    about the extremely steep [term structure](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/term%20structure)
    in the [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures)
    that I thought it is important to point out that in terms of current data, the
    VIX and historical volatility are sitting right in the middle of historical norms.

- en: The chart below captures the mean VIX (red line) and mean S&P 500 10-day [historical
    volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/historical%20volatility)
    (HV) values (blue line) for each year going back to 1990\. In addition, I have
    added a beige column to show the ratio of the annual means for each year. After
    an unusual pattern in which the VIX spiked higher than HV in 2008 and remained
    persistently high relative to HV in 2009 (think “[disaster imprinting](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/disaster%20imprinting),”)
    it now looks as if the relationship between the two is back to the more standard
    correlation and differential. Note also that the VIX is typically about 35% higher
    than historical volatility in the SPX, about what has transpired so far in 2010.

    VIX futures [contango](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/contango),
    but for now, but the present looks very much like business as usual.
