# VIX and More: Bernanke and Moody's May Have Accelerated Formation of Bottom

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/07/bernanke-and-moodys-may-have.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/07/bernanke-and-moodys-may-have.html#0001-01-01)

As I type this, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down about 200 and the VIX has spiked to 30.79, largely as a result of prepared remarks by Ben Bernanke and a downgrade by Moody's of Fannie Mae ([FNM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/FNM)) and Freddie Mac ([FRE](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/FRE)).

As a result of these two developments, some [capitulation](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/capitulation) activity has been accelerated and the likelihood of an intermediate bottom forming today, tomorrow or Thursday is now over 95%.
