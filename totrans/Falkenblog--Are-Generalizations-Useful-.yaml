    alone is a distinction of merit." Journalism is primarily about anecdotes, witness
    the Malcom Gladwell phenomenon.

    male-female relationships. One commenter (a 'sex activist') noted that

    sex as (or the kind of sex that) they want out of long-term relationships. And
    that there are men who have considerably more complex experiences of sexuality
    than you seem to acknowledge here.

    men), and some women got hysterical (heh) about the insight. Let's be clear. A
    stereotype is that all A are A. These are generally untrue, because there are
    exceptions to most assertions (eg, 'men are taller than women'). But generalizations
    are true and useful. It is useful to know that walking in a dark alley containing
    a bunch of young men is dangerous for a young woman. Not that all such situations
    mean bad things will happen, but the odds imply it is not a good idea.

    is part of an intelligent life. For those who think only deterministic relations
    are interesting, or known facts about individuals, I just can't empathize. I find
    it a childish view of life. Not that anecdotes and biographies aren't interesting,
    but they are primarily interesting as how they are relevant to everyone's story,
    or a metaphor for something larger.
