- en: with former Obama CEA Chair Jason Furman on June 6 rather disturbing. Furman
    expressed the opinion that the Fed would need to raise rates by 50 basis points
    before the rate hike cycle is complete, though he believed that it would skip
    a hike at the June FOMC meeting.

    for several months, which is causing concern for the Fed.

- en: This prompted a discussion of the level of unemployment needed to slow inflation
    to acceptable levels, which Furman estimated at 4.5–5.0% (which incidentally would
    trigger a Sahm Rule recession alert). The question arose, “Is such a level of
    unemployment politically palatable?”

    political pressure, but that was the wrong answer. Both the question and the reply
    demonstrated a level of economic myopia that’s sure to lead investors astray.
