    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    surrounding the summit, but the consensus was both sides would agree to a trade
    truce. Mytrade war factor, which measures the relative performance of companies
