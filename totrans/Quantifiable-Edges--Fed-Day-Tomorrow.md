# Quantifiable Edges: Fed Day Tomorrow

> 来源：[http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2010/11/fed-day-tomorrow.html#0001-01-01](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2010/11/fed-day-tomorrow.html#0001-01-01)

Just a quick reminder that tomorrow is a Fed Day.  Over the last few years I've written an awful lot about Fed Days and market behavior on and around them.  In general, Fed Days have been bullish, though there are certain nuances that substantially affect the edges.  For those that may want to review some of the edges I have identified, you can check out the Fed Day label on the right hand side of the blog, or use the link below:

Of course the most complete collection of my Fed Day studies is contained in the Quantifiable Edges Guide to Fed Days.  For more information on the book/ebook, check out the link below:
