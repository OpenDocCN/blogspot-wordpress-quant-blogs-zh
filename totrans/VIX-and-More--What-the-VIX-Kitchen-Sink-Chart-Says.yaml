- en: One of the more interesting developments of 2012 has been to watch the diminution
    of the strident bearish narrative that has been focused largely on the collision
    course between a preponderance of debt and low or negative growth. The bullish
    beginning to 2012, however, has not prompted many in the way of converts to the
    bullish camp. Instead, there have been whispers of “…overbought…” that have turned
    into a soft murmur and are now verging on becoming a loud chorus. Suddenly the
    general consensus seems to be that stocks just do not deserve their current lofty
    valuation.

    to [confirmation bias](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/confirmation%20bias)
    and scramble to find one or more indicators which will tell them what they have
    already begun to believe: that a major correction is likely just around the corner.'

    those who are looking for evidence of a market reversal.

- en: In the chart below, I have updated and extended a chart from three years ago
    that I call my “VIX kitchen sink chart” – as it pokes and prods the VIX in a number
    of different ways. Standard VIX analysis attempts to determine whether the VIX
    has strayed too far from historical norms, whether this be in the form of moving
    averages, [Bollinger bands](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Bollinger%20bands)
    or other mechanisms. I have even included a separate [rate of change](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/rate%20of%20change)
    study (with its own Bollinger bands) and a [Bollinger band width](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Bollinger%20band%20width)
    study below the main chart in order to provide a couple of additional analytical
    twists.

    is indeed just around the corner, the VIX does not appear to be aware of any such
    inevitability. Instead, it looks a lot more like business as usual in the land
    of the CBOE Volatility Index.
