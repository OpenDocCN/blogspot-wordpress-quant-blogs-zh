## System Under Specification

Uncle Bob’s recent [posting](http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2013/12/10/Thankyou-Kent.html) on Extreme Programming, a Reflection, should remind us all of the importance of testing:

> *Testing*: The notion that programmers, and customers, write automated tests that verify that the production code actually does what they think it should. Nowadays we call this Test Driven Development (TDD) and Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD).

Trisha’s ongoing series of [articles](http://mechanitis.blogspot.co.uk/2013/12/spock-data-driven-testing.html) centred around [Spock](http://code.google.com/p/spock/wiki/SpockBasics) is thus appropriate reading material on ways to test code, providing a handy [reminder](https://speakerdeck.com/hlship/spock-a-highly-logical-way-to-test) that basic unit testing really doesn’t cut it in today’s world of good software practices.  [Spock](http://code.google.com/p/spock/) leverages all the DSL 🙂 power of the [Groovy](http://gvmtool.net/) language to make [testing](http://code.google.com/p/spock/wiki/PublisherSubscriberSpecification) a [breeze](http://vimeo.com/67358303).  As expected, Intellij support is [provided](http://code.google.com/p/spock/wiki/GettingStarted).
