    jump in with both feet and buy the most liquid part of the market. To put the
    relative liquidity of the stock market in context, the top 20% of the S&P 500
    by market cap represents roughly two-thirds of the weight of the index. If you
    had a large amount, say $10-20 billion, to put into the market while everyone
