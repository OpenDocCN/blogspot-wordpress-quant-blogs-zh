- en: My Trend Asset Allocation Model has performed well by beating a 60/40 benchmark
    on an out-of-sample basis in the last few years. The early version of the Trend
    Model relied exclusively on commodity prices for signals of global reflation and
    deflation. While the inputs have changed to include global equity prices, this
    nevertheless raises some concerns for equity investors.
