    a rare [Batman pattern](http://i104.photobucket.com/albums/m163/bl82/Batman-Logo.jpg)
    forming in the VIX (and in the implied volatility of the SPX and SPY).

    first setting in; the head was completed last week, when the situation looked
    most bleak; and now the left wing is taking shape as the forces of good seek to
    gain the upper hand over the forces of evil.

    conclude that [Gotham City](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotham_City) will likely
    be spared the full force of the financial [Armageddon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armageddon)
    that appears to be bearing down on us.
