    if Mr. Market couldn't decide if another four years of the Obama Administration
    was good or bad. Initially, ES futures sold off hard as the polls closed and Obama
    gained ground on Romney. It then rallied soon after Obama was declared the victor
    and the  USD weakened against most currencies. Most Asian and European bourses rose
    overnight. As the markets are poised to open on Wednesday, ES futures are deeply
    in the red and the USD has regained a bid.

    and the risk-off trade, is forming a wedge - a sign of indecision for technicians.

    it will typically break hard in the direction of the break.
