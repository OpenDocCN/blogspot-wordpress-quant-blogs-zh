- en: The advantage of the huge vocabulary of English, of course, is that it makes
    English a superb literary and scientific language, able to express fine and precise
    shades of meaning far more easily than other tongues. This is no small part of
    the reason English has become the near universal language of science. It also
    makes English more efficient. The English version of a lengthy text is always
    substantially shorter than versions in other languages.

    gender. English isn't perfect, but it could be worse.
