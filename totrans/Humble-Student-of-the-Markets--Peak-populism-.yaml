    Economist covers are contrarian; little better than tossing a coin. After 360
    days, the signal is a lot more reliable—68.2% are contrarian. Buying the asset
    if the cover is very bearish results in an 18% return over the following year;
    shorting the asset when the cover is bullish generates a return of 7.5%.
