    two conditions need to be met. One is sufficient progress toward full-employment
    with the expectation of further progress. I think that condition has already been
    met. The second condition is confidence that inflation will indeed trend toward
    target. That condition has not been met. To meet that condition requires at least
    one of the following sub-conditions: Rising core-inflation, rising market-based
    measures of inflation compensation, or accelerating wage growth. If any were to
    occur before June, I suspect it would be the accelerating wage growth.'

    That leaves us with market-based measures of inflation compensation. And at this

    the Fed may see a way clear to hiking rates in June. But the pace and timing of
    subsequent rate hikes would still be data dependent. I would anticipate a fairly
    slow, halting path of rate hikes in the absence of faster wage growth.

    rather than “inflation expectations.” The gap between the nominal yields on 10-year
    Treasuries, for example, and TIPS have declined—that’s inflation compensation.
    And five-year, five-year-forwards, as you’ve said, have also declined. That could
    reflect a change in inflation expectations, but it could also reflect changes
    in assessment of inflation risks.

    especially have fallen if the probabilities attached to very high inflation have
    come down. And it can also reflect liquidity effects in markets. And, for example,
    it’s sometimes the case that— when there is a flight to safety, that flight tends
    to be concentrated in nominal Treasuries and could also serve to compress that
    spread. So I think the jury is out about exactly how to interpret that downward
    move in inflation compensation.***'

    that she believes that there are other terms that are in the 5Y5Y figure. In other

    this latest data point is highly suggestive that inflationary pressures remain
    tame. No doubt, there will be lots of debate at the upcoming FOMC meeting over
    the improving employment picture vs. the lack of inflationary pressure, but current
    readings indicate that Tim Duy's criteria that "inflation will indeed trend toward
    target" is not satisfied.
