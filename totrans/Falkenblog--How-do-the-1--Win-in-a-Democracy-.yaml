    majority, but are totally incompetent or unwilling to assert their preferences.
    What's the matter with Kansas? Here's a simple theory, where I will assume there's
    pretty much a 50-50 split currently among the electorate as to the preferred direction
    for tax rates, regulation, etc. Those who succeed in the marketplace favor allocation
    by markets, not governments. Those who do not succeed in markets favor government.

    the highest levels of dopamine when pleasure is anticipated, not when pleasure
    is actually experienced. See the graph above for a picture of how dopamine spikes
    upward not when the monkey gets the reward, but rather when it anticipates getting
    the reward; the actual reward is anticlimactic.

    is what drives people's political regime preferences. A person's preference for
    more government over less would involve whether one's relative competence is greater
    in the private or public sphere. Increasing government through more taxes and
    regulation is good for those with a comparative advantage in politics, not good
    for those good in the private sector. If the economy contains only the private
    sector and government, this means increasing marginal tax rates is only good for
    those who are relatively good at government.

    for the direct self-interest of their income level, but are rather 'groupish',
    or altruistic towards their group whatever it may be (humanity for some, a tribe
    for most). In the long run moving to a larger or smaller relative private sector
    affects one's future with a different sign depending on one's 'skills'.

    me $2 if I fill it out, all for some vague corporate crime. Such class action
    suits aren''t interesting to me because  they are not worth my hourly wage and
    more importantly they don''t raise my status, rather redistribute money from some
    unknown corporate exec to some unknown lawyer plus everyone.  Similarly, bonking
    all the George Soroses on the head, taking their money, and giving to all Americans
    would be pretty pointless: it wouldn''t raise the relative status of anyone other
    than the chief prosecutor. If I think this money won''t merely be redistributed,
    but rather, reallocated towards a different sector, I have to ask myself: which
    sector do I want to see succeed? An increase in tax rates or government benefits
    implies a relatively larger governmental sector.'

- en: Diversity consultants, union reps, etc., want the size of government to grow
    because it helps their status; those good a solving problems for a profit maximizers
    would relatively lose, and prefer the opposite. This is why the issue of tax rates
    is usually a toss-up even though, from a simple perspective given the lognormal
    distribution of wealth this seems counter-productive. Those good at markets want
    the non-governmental sector to thrive, even if that means the superstars become
    billionaires. It's not anticipating a higher income for everyone via trickle down
    economics, it's anticipating higher status for them as their preferred sector
    grows.
