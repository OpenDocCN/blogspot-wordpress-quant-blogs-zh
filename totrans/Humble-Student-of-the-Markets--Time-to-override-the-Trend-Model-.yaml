    other words, I try to use intuition and experience to interpret my quantitative

- en: This may be one of those occasions. My Trend Model is a trend-following model
    that uses global stock and commodity prices to forecast risk-on and risk-off conditions.
    Trend following models are, by their very nature, a little slow to pick up trends,
    but they profit from the bandwagon effect when an investment trend is persistent.

    whipsaws are serious limitations of trend following models.

    band. These are rare, and even rarer when the weekly RSI 14 is over 70, and ***this
    is only the tenth such punch in the last twenty years***. I've had a look at the
    previous nine to see what they can tell us about what to expect next.

    high, though another five topped out within 2% of the punch level, before making
    a retracement that went at least back below the punch level and ranged in size
    from 3% to 21%. The exception was in June 1997 which went into an eight day upper
    band ride that ran up 80 points before retracing 70 points. ***This is a fairly
    bearish history, with one strong exception***.

    valued. Of course, the bears say that they are grossly overvalued because they
    are expecting a recession. In their opinion, the problem is that earnings are
    at a record high and so are profit margins. So these two are increasingly likely
    to go down rather than up.

    overvaluation problem because they are based on analysts’ consensus expectations
    for earnings that are too optimistic. That’s true if a recession is coming soon.
    I don’t see one coming soon, so I don’t have a problem using forward P/Es for
    assessing valuation. Nevertheless, there is a valuation problem, though it isn’t
    as extreme as the bears say it is.
