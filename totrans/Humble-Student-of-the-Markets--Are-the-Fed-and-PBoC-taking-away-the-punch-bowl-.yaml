    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    said that the job of the Federal Reserve was to take away the punch bowl just
    as the party gets going. In the past week, there has been rising angst over two
    separate central bank actions that may indicate that the "punch bowl" is leaving
    the global party.

    FOMC statement and the strength of the April Employment Report makes a June rate
    hike a virtual certainty. Barring further "data sensitivity", the Fed is well
    on its way to raise rates three times in 2017, and to begin reducing its balance
    sheet either late this year or early next year. At the same time, the Citigroup
    US Economic Surprise Index, which measures whether macro releases are beating
    or missing expectations, has been tanking. These readings, along with the weak
    Q1 GDP growth figures, raise the risk of a Fed policy error as it tightens into
    a weakening economy.
