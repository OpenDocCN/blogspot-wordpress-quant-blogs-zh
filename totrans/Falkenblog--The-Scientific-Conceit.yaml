- en: The idea that science is a uniquely self critical institution is of course preposterous..scientists
    are no more self critical than anyone else, they hate to be criticized and never
    criticize themselves...There are local mechanisms of criticisms in science, within
    established theories if somebody publishes data that don't work out in a certain
    way, if there are mathematical flaws in a certain theory, these tend to get know,
    but large global criticisms of the scientific enterprise are very difficult to
    find, and certainly not being promulgated by the scientists with any ebullience
    or enthusiasm ... these people are only human, they hate criticism--me too! The
    idea that scientists are absolutely eager to get beaten up that's one of the myths,
    put out by the scientists, and it works out splendidly so that they can avoid
    criticism.

    how science is so different than other professions in how they objectively present
    their work for criticism. The journal publication process does filter out a lot
    of errors and unsubstantiated assertions that a journalist might get away with,
    but that's really a very narrow domain, it's like noting a New Yorker piece is
    meticulously checks for grammar (unlike my blog!). It's ruthless criticism in
    a very specific domain.

    the different black-white abortion rate relate to the difference in Black-White
    crime rate over the next 20 years? How did that relate the crime rate differential
    between 17 year olds and 35 year olds, 17 years after Roe? How does the small
    difference in fertility post Roe relate to an selectivity effect (clearly, as
    abortions went up, so did conceptions)? What if you adjusted for population growth?
    All of these are large, glaring points against Levitt, really common sense type
    rebuttals, yet he never had to address them because he presented a panel regression
    with interaction terms.

- en: I have refereed papers with interaction terms, and they are almost always garbage,
    because they generate a lot of collinearity, and the nonlinear correlations manifest
    themselves in a bunch of significant coefficients in linear regressions, because
    if the 'true' relation is y=x^2, and x=A+2B+e, then a regression on y with A and
    B will have a positive coefficient on A, and a negative on B. Levitt's study has
    state*age, year*age, and state*year as explanatory variables. Why stop there,
    why not state*year*age? With tens of regressors, many product terms, you get garbage.
    Yet, I've refereed reports from professors at Harvard with this stuff, so it's
    not something that's necessarily wrong, just practically stupid. There has been
    no important result that shows up only via interaction terms in regressions, just
    as there has never been an important relationship evinced solely via 3-stage least
    squares, or the Generalize Method of Moments (GMM). Ever. Rather than correcting
    error terms for heteroskedasticity or something inside-the-box, there should be
    more skepticism applied to these kitchen-sink approaches.

    very defensive, like someone unused to criticism. In sum, Levitt, like most scientists,
    is exposed to a very narrow set of criticisms, ones that most laypeople could
    not counter to be sure (must get one's standard errors correct), but that's really
    no different than the fact that most people (me included) could not write prose
    for the New Yorker with their syntax errors. In most ways he is unexposed to real
    criticism and acts accordingly.
