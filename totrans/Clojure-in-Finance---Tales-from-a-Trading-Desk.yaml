    bank usage that are on the web.  Based on a quick Google, there [Deutsche](http://techmeshconf.com/techmesh-london-2012/presentation/Sharing%20Data,%20hiding%20Complexity%20(with%20Clojure%20and%20RDF)),
    UBS (blogged about previously) and [Citi](http://dev.clojure.org/display/community/Clojure+Success+Stories)
    as a minimum.  The general pattern appears to be that within a bank, a particular
    area manages to persuade management to accept the “new” language into the fold.
    [Pithering About](http://www.pitheringabout.com/?p=693) provides some reasons
    for [Clojure](http://www.drdobbs.com/mobile/thoughtworks-eyes-seismic-shift-in-progr/240009675)
    usage on a middle office project.

    InfoQ has a few articles on [Datomic](http://docs.datomic.com/architecture.html)

    component, offering anyone is finance the possible usage of Datomic from a tickDB
    perspective.  I’d be curious to know of anyone who has PoC’d this concept, as
    it would make an interesting alternative to other vendor products such as [kdb](http://kx.com/kdb-plus-tick.php)
    and oneTick.
