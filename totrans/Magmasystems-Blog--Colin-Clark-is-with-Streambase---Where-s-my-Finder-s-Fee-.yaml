    was looking for new opportunities. I also proposed that Streambase hire Colin
    and some of his gang, as they were all in the Boston area together.

    was consulting with Goldman in the late 1980's, I was friendly with Bill, as our
    groups interacted. I actually interviewed with Bill and Mike Dubnow for a job
    in Fischer Black's group, but mercifully, they spared me the pain of having to
    try to understand the world of the Quants (leaving me the opportunity to go full-time
    into Magma Systems after I left Goldman). Emmanuel Derman has written extensively
    about the goings-on in Black's little world.

    at Goldman, and has since retired. I think that Mike was one of the creators of
    the SLANG language at Goldman.
