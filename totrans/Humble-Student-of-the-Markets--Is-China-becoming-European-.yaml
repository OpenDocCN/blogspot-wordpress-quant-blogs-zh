    the household sector in China, which would help re-balance growth towards the
    consumer. The bigger picture remains uncertain, as the problems in the banking
    sector is starting to make China look like pre-crisis Europe.

    Before crisis, banks raced to lend to peripheral countries because of the perception
    of that there was little or no credit risk. It's all one eurozone, right? They
    are all sovereigns in the eurozone and sovereigns don't default, right?

    the bonds of their own countries. Yield spreads between peripheral country bonds
    and Bunds narrowed to microscopic levels. When the crisis hit, national governments
    were handcuffed from bailing out their own banking system because their banks
    were stuffed full of their own governments' debt. So how do you bail out yourself?

    a result, the cost of growth was too much investment spending in infrastructure

    that thought and acted like commercial companies. **To the contrary, the result
    was an implicit guarantee to SOEs that they would not go bankrupt, which in turn

    and sparks a global financial panic. At best, bailing out SOEs and local government
    authorities amounts to financial repression of the household sector and impedes
    the government's stated policy of re-balancing growth to the consumer and household
    sectors of the economy, which would create long-term headwinds for China's growth
    path.
