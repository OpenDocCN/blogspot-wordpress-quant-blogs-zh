    risen 0.75% or more. The results were quite bearish over the next 1-10 days. Most
    traders may have seen that and factored it in to their thinking at the time and
    then forgotten about it.

    performed since 2008 study was published. Being aware of when the setup is occurring
    can benefit traders in numerous ways. You could use it to enter short positions,
    or exit longs, or tighten stops, or adjust position sizes, or whatever suits your
    trading style.

- en: The Quantifinder is designed to automatically search through Quantifiable Edges
    database of published research and extract anything that is applicable to the
    current day's market action. This includes studies based on price, breadth, volume,
    leadership, and sector rotation. It looks at both daily and weekly data across
    a wide range of indices. All applicable studies are then published on the Quantifinder
    page, where you can easily see their bullish/bearish tendencies and a description
    of the research. From there it is just a click on the study and the publication
    (blog, Subscriber Letter, or Weekly Research Letter) is automatically pulled up.
    This allows you to read what I've written about similar setups in the past. A
    screenshot of the Quantifinder is below.
