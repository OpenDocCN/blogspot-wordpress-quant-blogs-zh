    sectors of the stock market. The top panel of the chart below shows that the relative

    a relative support level and is in a downtrend. Because XLI is heavily weighted
    with GE, the second panel shows the equal weighted Industrial stocks against an
    equal weighted SPX - and that chart looks even worse. The third panel shows the
    relative performance of the cyclically sensitive semiconductors, which has violated
