# Falkenblog: Tax Breaks for Olympians?

Even

[Obama](http://miami.cbslocal.com/2012/08/07/obama-signals-approval-for-olympic-tax-relief/)

seems to be for giving Olympians tax breaks on their medal income.

Olympians work hard, but there's always an element of luck too. Others derive benefits from their performances, and these champions all rely on the support of others. Thus, it's just like any other income in principle.

No wonder mentions of eliminating tax loopholes usually go nowhere once a politician gets in office.  Tax breaks for popular demographics and projects seem a costless way to do good and win favor.
