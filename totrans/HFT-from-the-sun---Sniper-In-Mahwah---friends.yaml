    is a professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz (Department of Astronomy
    and Astrophysics). I came to know his work when I started to study the microwave
    networks used to speed the flow of market data. Laughlin, Joseph Grundfest and
    Anthony Aguirre published “[Information Transmission between Chicago and New York](http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.5966)”
    in 2013, focusing on the “latency decrease attributed to line-of-sight microwave
    networks” – an interesting insight into the price correlations between New York
    equities and Chicago futures related to the last technologie, very helpful to
    understand what the fastest traders in the world do. Greg Laughlin also has a [blog](http://oklo.org) (I’ll
    talk about it in Part V of the microwave series) and wrote this wonderful piece,
    “[Third Data Server From the Sun](http://nautil.us/issue/13/symmetry/third-data-server-from-the-sun)”.'

- en: Laughlin’s interest in market microstructure and HFT led him to analyze the
    [legal files](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1592386/000104746914002070/a2218589zs-1.htm) given
    by Virtu to he SEC when the firm tried an IPO, and wrote a short study titled
    “Insights Into High Frequency Trading From The Virtu Initial Public Offering”.
    Curiously, this study [hit the news](http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/11/13/virtus-losing-day-was-1-in-1238-odds-says-it-shouldnt-have-happened-at-all/)
    recently, so Greg Laughlin slightly updated it. The new version is [here](https://sniperinmahwah.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/virtuoverview.pdf). “At
    time scales where the finite speed of light is a consideration, equity HFT consists
    largely of market making, accelerated by arbitrage of fleeting intermarket price
    discrepancies and by predictive models“, Laughlin writes. That’s why some HFT
    firms need microwave networks. Market making is hard.
