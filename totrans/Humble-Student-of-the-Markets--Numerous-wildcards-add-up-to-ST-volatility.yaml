- en: As the S&P 500 tests the 4900 level, it faces a number of key technical, top-down
    macro and fundamental challenges. These challenges are wildcards to the near-term
    path of stock prices and form the potential for volatility in the coming week.

- en: From a technical perspective, some caution is warranted. We recently highlighted
    a short-term buy signal when NYSE McClellan Oscillator (NYMO) recycled from oversold
    to neutral. The “take profits” tripwire for this trading signal occurs when NYMO
    reaches a positive reading, which occurred last Thursday. If you were tactically
    long the market, it’s time to reduce risk. Don’t try to be a hero.
