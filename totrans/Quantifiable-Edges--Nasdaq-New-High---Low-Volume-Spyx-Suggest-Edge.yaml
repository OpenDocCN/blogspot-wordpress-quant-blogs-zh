    look at comparative volume across multiple securities. When ratios get out of
    whack, it often shows up as an upside or downside spike on the chart.) Closes
    below zero are rare and often lead to weakness over the next few days. This is
    especially so when the market rises along with the low readings. Below is a study
    that exemplifies this.

    edge over the next several days. The edge appears the strongest over the 1st 2
    days, when much of the damage has been done. Not evident above is that 13 of 14
    instances closed lower than the trigger-day close at some point in the next 3
    days.

    all suggests a downside edge in the Nasdaq 100 over the next few days.
