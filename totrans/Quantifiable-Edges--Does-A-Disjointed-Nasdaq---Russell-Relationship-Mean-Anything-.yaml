- en: The correlation between the Nasdaq 100 and the Russell 2000 in 2007 was about
    0.65\. Over the last seven days the correlation is -0.14\. While it’s a mildly
    unusual for the correlation of the two to become negative over seven day time
    spans, it’s not terribly notable. What is notable is something my father-in-law,
    a very smart and observant trader who is always full of ideas, pointed out to
    me yesterday. *The percent change spread between the two indices has been greater
    than 1% each of the last seven days.* Even days when they are going in the same
    direction, the disparity between the returns has been large. It’s not because
    one is clearly outperforming the other. They’ve taken turns having the best/worst
    performance.

    I ran the tests. Over the last 20 years I found 10 other instances of 1% or greater
    divergences of seven days or longer. The most recent occurred in 2001\. I then
    looked to see how the Nasdaq performed over the 20 trading days following an event.
    The 10 trades are listed in the table below.

- en: With the exception of the 1996 trade, the remaining instances all occurred between
    1999 and 2001\. The first thing I noticed was that while half the trades occurred
    during the recent bear market, 9 of the 10 instances led to positive returns over
    the next 20 days. This would indicate a decent chance of a bullish bias. This
    is not what really caught my eye though.

    gained 12.8% in the next 20 days. The lone loser lost 18.1%. The average range
    for the 10 instances was 24.25%, with the smallest range being 14.9% and the largest
    a whopping 36.5%. Truly eye-catching numbers.

- en: While it’s difficult to draw any concrete conclusions from this study, it appears
    to me that when major indices diverge this much, something is possibly disjointed
    in the market. This disjointedness has often corrected itself and led to a multi-week
    rally. In all cases though, it seems to indicate the market is volatile and is
    likely to remain that way for a while. This agrees with several of the other studies
    I have discussed recently. Recall my summary in
