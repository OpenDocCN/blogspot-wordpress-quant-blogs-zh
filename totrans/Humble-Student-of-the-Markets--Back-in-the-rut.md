**Mid-week market update:**

[Bragelina breakup](http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/entertainment/angelina-jolie-brad-pitt-divorce/)

hit the tape, I mistakenly believed that the stock market did not display sufficient fear to form a durable bottom (see the trading comments in

[Is a recession just around the corner?](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/09/18/is-a-recession-just-around-the-corner/)

).

 found that the bullishness of his sample of NASDAQ market timers had retreated but readings weren't at a bearish extreme, which suggested that a scenario of more market choppiness.

The CNN Money

[Fear and Greed Index](http://money.cnn.com/data/fear-and-greed/)

had fallen to levels where the market had bounced before, but it could have gone a lot lower. Even if it were to bottom at these levels, I would not necessarily discount a W-shaped bottom where the index declined to the recent lows before rising again.
