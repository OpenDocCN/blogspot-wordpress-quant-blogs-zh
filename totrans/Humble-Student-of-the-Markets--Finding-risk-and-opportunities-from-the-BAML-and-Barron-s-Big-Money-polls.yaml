    necessarily true. Different managers have different mandates that color their
    views. As well, their geographical base can also create differences in opinions
    in how their view their world and markets.

    of US based managers. Another well known poll, the BAML Fund Manager Survey, is

    astute investors can find opportunities, as well as understand the blind spots
    of each group.
