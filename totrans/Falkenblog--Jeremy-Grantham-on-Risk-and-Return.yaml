    theory says nothing about [risk and returns]. Our theory relates risk to "expected
    returns" not ex-post returns."

    currencies, dozens of countries, and with all that data, somehow 'expected' returns
    are so different than actual returns that they seem orthogonal, it's a rather
    strange thing. It's like saying one's investments will probably, in their lifetime,
    not be correlated with one's expectations. So, why waste time studying finance?

    omnipresent and important, reminds me of attempts to explain the mysterious absence
    of the aether in the 19th century, because this was the medium through which light
    and gravity traveled, it was supposedly everywhere. Like 'risk', no one could
    measure it, so ever more clever reasons were adduced as to why nature hides what
    is all around us. See this little piece on

    science!). Fresnel was able to come up with an equation very much like special
    relativity, and thus matching reality, but using wrong assumptions, because a
    good mathematically oriented modeler can always get from assumptions to data if
    you give him enough time (the degrees of freedom are hidden within the functional
    form or algorithm). We have a glut of Fresnellian finance going on right now'

    data begins) ... On noticing this outperformance, embarrassingly late in my opinion,
    Fama and French adopted a circular argument rather typical of ﬁnance academics
    in the 1970 to 2000 era: the market is efﬁcient; P/B and small cap outperform,
    ergo they must be risk factors. That the result in this case happens to get to
    the right result is luck. The real behavioral market is perfectly happy not rewarding
    “risk” when it feels like it, as is shown by the 70-year underperformance of high
    beta stocks. But this time it worked. Price-to-book, despite its low beta, is
    a risk factor because of its low fundamental quality and its vulnerability to
    failure in a depression. This is true with small cap as well. But what about “Quality?”
    This factor has outperformed forever. (The S&P had a High Grade Index that started
    in 1925 and handsomely outperformed the S&P 500 to the end of 1965 when our data
    starts.) Since the market is efﬁcient, to Fama and French quality must be a risk
    factor! So, by protecting you in the 1929 Crash and in 2008, and by having a low
    beta for that matter, Quality as represented by Coca-Cola and Johnson & Johnson
    must be a hidden risk factor. Oh, I know: “The real world is merely an inconvenient
    special case!”'

  zh: 实际上，自1965年（我们质量数据开始的时间）以来，优质股票的表现超过了市场... 我认为对这种表现的注意到来得太晚了，法玛和法rench在70年代至2000年代间采用了典型的循环论证：市场是有效的；价值市净率和小市值投资超越了市场，所以它们必须是风险因素。在这种情况下的结果碰巧得到了正确的结果，这是幸运。在70年的高贝塔股票的表现不佳表明，真正的行为市场很乐意在自己感觉不舒服的时候，不奖励“风险”。但这一次有效了。尽管价值市净率具有较低的贝塔，但它是一个风险因素，因为它具有较低的基本质量，并且在经济大萧条中容易失败。小市值股票也是如此。但“质量”呢？这一因素一直表现不俗。（标准普尔指数自1925年开始有一个高级指数，一直到我们数据开始的1965年结束时都比标普500指数表现出色。）由于市场是有效的，对法玛和法rench来说，质量必须是一个风险因素！因此，通过在1929年和2008年保护您，而且说到底，质量（由可口可乐和强生公司代表）具有较低的贝塔，必须是一个隐藏的风险因素。哦，我知道：“真实世界只是一个不方便的特例！”
