    nor expected risk, only actual returns. He was even stronger, saying "Finance
    theory says nothing about [risk and returns]. Our theory relates risk to "expected
    returns" not ex-post returns."

    currencies, dozens of countries, and with all that data, somehow 'expected' returns
    are so different than actual returns that they seem orthogonal, it's a rather
    strange thing. It's like saying one's investments will probably, in their lifetime,
    not be correlated with one's expectations. So, why waste time studying finance?

    omnipresent and important, reminds me of attempts to explain the mysterious absence
    of the aether in the 19th century, because this was the medium through which light
    and gravity traveled, it was supposedly everywhere. Like 'risk', no one could
    measure it, so ever more clever reasons were adduced as to why nature hides what
    is all around us. See this little piece on

    science!). Fresnel was able to come up with an equation very much like special
    relativity, and thus matching reality, but using wrong assumptions, because a
    good mathematically oriented modeler can always get from assumptions to data if
    you give him enough time (the degrees of freedom are hidden within the functional
    form or algorithm). We have a glut of Fresnellian finance going on right now'

    data begins) ... On noticing this outperformance, embarrassingly late in my opinion,
    Fama and French adopted a circular argument rather typical of ﬁnance academics
    in the 1970 to 2000 era: the market is efﬁcient; P/B and small cap outperform,
    ergo they must be risk factors. That the result in this case happens to get to
    the right result is luck. The real behavioral market is perfectly happy not rewarding
    “risk” when it feels like it, as is shown by the 70-year underperformance of high
    beta stocks. But this time it worked. Price-to-book, despite its low beta, is
    a risk factor because of its low fundamental quality and its vulnerability to
    failure in a depression. This is true with small cap as well. But what about “Quality?”
    This factor has outperformed forever. (The S&P had a High Grade Index that started
    in 1925 and handsomely outperformed the S&P 500 to the end of 1965 when our data
    starts.) Since the market is efﬁcient, to Fama and French quality must be a risk
    factor! So, by protecting you in the 1929 Crash and in 2008, and by having a low
    beta for that matter, Quality as represented by Coca-Cola and Johnson & Johnson
    must be a hidden risk factor. Oh, I know: “The real world is merely an inconvenient
    special case!”'
