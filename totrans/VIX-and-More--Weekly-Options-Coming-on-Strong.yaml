- en: When the CBOE made a push to expand interest in [weekly options](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/weeklys)
    about two years ago, their efforts were initially met with a fair degree of skepticism.
    Over time, however, weekly options have found a dedicated following, with the
    CBOE “weeklys” growing from 1% of total volume to about 15% today. Two years ago
    there were a handful of index weeklys, as well as a handful of weekly options
    based on ETPs and individual stocks. The list of weekly options changes every
    week, but the current [list for weeklys expiring on May 4^(th)](http://www.cboe.com/publish/weelkysmf/weeklysmf.xls)
    now includes options on six indexes, 26 ETPs and 119 individual stocks. What was
    once a curiosity is now a groundswell.

    instance, I tweeted that the [VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX)
    18/19 call spreads had the same price for the weekly options as next month’s standard
    May 19^(th) expiration.

    in Amazon ([AMZN](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/AMZN)), where today’s
    April 27^(th) weeklys (red line) have a huge [implied volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/implied%20volatility)
    (and therefore price) premium to their counterparts with more distant maturities.
    Looking at the graphic, one can see that it is not that difficult to construct
    positions with weekly options (which also include the May 4^(th) options, shown
    with a yellow line) in which one leg has implied volatility that is 50-100% higher
    than another leg. If you have a bias toward selling options, as I do, this can
    sometimes offer up an irresistible mathematical edge.

    I check for is whether the underlying in question has weekly options. If you have
    weeklys, you are in the big leagues and there are so many more trading opportunities.
    With [ZNGA](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/ZNGA) weekly options being
    added this week, for instance, the ease and flexibility of trading this issue
    around yesterday’s earnings report was dramatically improved.

    volumes are too small and the markets are too thin, think again.
