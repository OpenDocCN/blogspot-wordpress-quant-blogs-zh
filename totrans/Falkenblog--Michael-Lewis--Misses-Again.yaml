    It's a well-written article where, like Malcom Gladwell, he takes you into a story
    with an arc about staid conventional wisdom shown up by an intellectual maverick.

    chutzpah is the essence of this crisis and finance in general. While I agree that
    there is a considerable amount of ignorance and deception in finance, these are
    not particular to this industry, nor it's main characteristic.

    looking at mortgage lenders in the 1990's, learned they were mainly liars from

    so Eisman is a bit of a broken clock here, finally correct. The problem is, every
    salesman omits much, exaggerates much, something that might be characterized a
    lie. That's what they all do, but that does not mean every firm, every field,
    is about to crater. Eisman calculated that

    than anyone, and the new CDX default swaps allowed Eisman to put this trade on
    directly right when the market started to really get bad, a trade he had been
    predisposed towards for 15 years. In other words, Eisman was correct, but his
    permabear view on subprime mortgage highlights that subprime's essence is not
    the problem, but rather, the climax of the bubble was the issue. Lewis notes that
    in the end, investor demand really created these 'liar loans', because there was
    so much demand that unethical suppliers who knew better filled the need. This
    is a much more complicated issue, because if in the end, buyers were not doing
    due diligence, wasn't their demand, the essence of the problem? Where did this
    demand come from? In the end, this story is like someone talking about a Robber
    Baron making a fortune in the panic of 1893--interesting, but not the essence
    of the Industrial Revolution though some would like you to think so (see Hielbroner's
    Worldly Philosophers extended portrayal of conspicuous consumption and such).

    foisted on investing rubes, dominated by aggressive, smart (but ignorant) frat
    boys. Lewis had lunch with the focus of that book, former Salomon CEO John Gutfreund,
    and he notes Gutfreund confirms he didn''t really understand everything they did
    at Salomon, and his subordinates were greedy and didn''t really understand what
    they did.'

    for a leader is a drum major as opposed to inventors like Bill Gates and Microsoft.
    But then, salesmen are not the most informed on what they are selling, and market
    makers are often clueless about what drives the long term value of what they are
    buying and selling, and even Bill Gates now

    bubble, are different kinds of stupidity, and neither the distinguishing characteristic
    of finance. The natural stupidity of leaders, which I have blogged about many
    times before (eg,

    context, because the powerful masses they lead do not want to be dominated, and
    so they want someone ingratiating who is merely diplomatic, and good at articulating
    the practical consensus. The ignorance at the end of a cycle is quite different,
    the orgasmic phase with impossible business models that with hindsight always
    seem so stupid. These are different problems, and the theme, that stupidity and
    fluff underlies all finance, is a profoundly misleading insight, that unfortunately
    seems to stick with Lewis as his one big idea.
