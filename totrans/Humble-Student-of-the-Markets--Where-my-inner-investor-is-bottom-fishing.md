# Humble Student of the Markets: Where my inner investor is bottom fishing

I thought that, as a change of pace, I would write about where my inner investor is finding opportunities, instead of focusing on the daily gyrations of the stock market and whether it has found a short-term bottom, which is a topic I will cover in a post this weekend.

The art of bottom fishing requires a strong constitution, which is suitable for people like my inner investor who has a longer time horizon. You have to go into the exercise thinking that you don't care that you catch the exact bottom, but with a mindset that Mr. Market has put a sale price on an investment. You may buy X at $10, see it fall to $7, but be ultimately rewarded in several years when it rises to $20, $30 or $40 (note that these are just examples and not return forecasts).

With that framework in mind, here are a couple of opportunities identified by my inner investor.

. To be sure, I never expected the kind of downdraft that the market is experiencing, but I was directionally correct. What's more, my big picture calls were pretty good last year (and they contrarian enough that I got a ton of hate mail):
