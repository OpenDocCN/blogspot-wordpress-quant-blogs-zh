- en: '**Mid-week market update**: The market reaction to the FOMC decision was mostly
    a yawn. The Fed raised rates by a quarter-point, which was expected, and Powell
    refused to commit to further hikes while repeating his data dependency mantra. 
    As a consequence, the S&P 500 was mostly unchanged from before the decision to
    after the close. However, the 2-year Treasury yield, which is a proxy for Fed
    Funds expectations, did ease a little. Fed Funds expectations were mostly unchanged,
    other than the first easing was pulled from the May 2024 FOMC meeting to March.'
