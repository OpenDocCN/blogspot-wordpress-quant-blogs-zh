- en: '**Mid-week market update**: The market reaction to the FOMC decision was mostly
    a yawn. The Fed raised rates by a quarter-point, which was expected, and Powell
    refused to commit to further hikes while repeating his data dependency mantra. 
    As a consequence, the S&P 500 was mostly unchanged from before the decision to
    after the close. However, the 2-year Treasury yield, which is a proxy for Fed
    Funds expectations, did ease a little. Fed Funds expectations were mostly unchanged,
    other than the first easing was pulled from the May 2024 FOMC meeting to March.'

  zh: '**周三市场更新**：市场对美联储会议决策的反应大多较为平淡。美联储提升了利率25个基点，这是符合预期的，而鲍威尔拒绝承诺进一步加息，同时重复了他的数据依赖咒语。结果是，标普500指数在决策前后收盘时基本持平。然而，两年期国债收益率——这是美联储基金预期的代理——略有缓解。美联储基金预期除了第一次宽松从2024年5月的FOMC会议被推迟到3月外，基本未变。'
