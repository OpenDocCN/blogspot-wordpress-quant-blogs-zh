    fact is of mild interest in itself, but its implication has relevance to another
    interesting fact of behavioral finance, so I will reproduce our discussions here.

    above result, Sdev=2 as well. This may startle some of us: a standard deviation
    of 200% of our compounded growth rate g - wouldn''t ruin be very likely? But check
    out g itself: g=S^2/2, so g=2 when S=2, which means that g itself is exactly 200%.
    A Sdev of 200% here means that if the growth rate drops one standard deviation
    below its mean, we will still manage not to lose money for the year. Another way
    to put this is that there is a 84.1% chance that our annual return will be greater
    than 0, based on the Gaussian distribution.'

    just 3\. So you can see that as S goes above 2, a 1 standard deviation fluctuation
    of g below the mean will still get you a positive number: profitable for the year.'

    threshold in more ways that I realized. From behavioral finance experiments, we
    already know that humans demands $2 profits for $1 risk. Given the universal desire
    of portfolio managers not to lose money on the year, it turns out that the demand
    of a Sharpe ratio of at least 2 is quite rational!'
