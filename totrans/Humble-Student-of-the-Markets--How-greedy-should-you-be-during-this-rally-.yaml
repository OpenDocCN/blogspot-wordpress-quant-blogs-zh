    money, bears make money, hogs just get slaughtered." I issued a tactical buy signal
    to subscribers on the weekend based on my usually reliable S&P 500 Intermediate-Term
    Breadth Momentum Oscillator (ITBM). ITBM flashed a buy signal as of the close
    on Friday when its 14-day RSI recycled from oversold to neutral.'

- en: Now that the stock market is rallying, how greedy should you be? One guideline
    to consider is, after an ITBM buy signal, the percentage of S&P 500 above their
    20 dma generally reaches at least 60%, if not more, before the rally peters out.
    (Note one-day data delay on % above 20 dma).
