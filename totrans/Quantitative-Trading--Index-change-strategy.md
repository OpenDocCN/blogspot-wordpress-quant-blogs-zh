Some years ago, I traded a simple index change strategy: buying stocks to be added to the SP500 index at the market open right after the index change announcement and exiting the position at the close, and similarly shorting stocks to be deleted. The results were mediocre at best.

However,

[new research](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/8a737062-7d3c-11dd-8d59-000077b07658.html)

by University of Edinburgh Business School suggests that a similar strategy works well for FTSE350 stocks (Hat tip to J. Rigg for the link). The trick is to predict which stocks are to be added or deleted 30 days before the announcement ("review date"), buy/sell the stocks, and close out the positions just before the review date.

Since the criteria for inclusion in the FTSE index is

[well-defined](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTSE_100_Index)

(and primarily based on market capitalization), it should not be hard for the interested traders to make their own predictions and profit from this rebalancing.
