    deciding to go to business school and engage in the  requisite finance training,
    I was on track to entering a doctorate program in cognitive psychology .  Ironically
    I received cautionary advice from the business school guidance counselor about
    embarking on a finance major because: “you won’t be able to handle the math!” 
    and “finance is all about the numbers.” My decision to ignore his advice led me
    along the path to becoming a “quant.”'

- en: Behavioural finance giants like Kahneman and Tversky were commonplace names
    for me throughout the years, and I was quite familiar with their work. Funny my
    surprise when their work became the undoing of much is was  considered to be standard
    economic theory concerning rational agents. It is quite strange to read economic
    theories that assume that people act in a cold and rational manner when you have
    read hundreds of documented studies of people making “irrational” decisions on
    a wide variety of controlled tests. Furthermore, a person’s IQ was  not a mitigating
    or significant variable in these studies. Being a rational person myself, I began
    to realize that the assumption of rationality was designed specifically to make
    the “math” easier to solve rather than as an actual working theory.

- en: You see the problem is you can’t get away from people and their biases in decision
    making. It doesn’t even matter if you are a fund that controls a billion dollars
    and uses state of the art quantitative technology. You could have the best professors
    and minds around the globe working under your roof.  Ultimately if you have a
    down period or a down year, or just an unusual period, your investors dictate
    when you buy and sell things. When they pull the plug en masse, you will be creating
    a tidal wave of  forced liquidation on your own positions that is completely independent
    of your view or quantitative outlook of the market. If your fellow quant friends
    have also been using a lot of the strategies that you have been running even to
    a small degree, they will have a lot of overlap with your positions. Your liquidation
    impacts them and other related funds, and this can cause a domino effect of client
    withdrawals. Suddenly everyone is running for the exits at one time and finally
    we have a mini-meltdown.

- en: Why has the last two years seen such violent swings? The answer is people. 
    Fear, greed, decision regret, and depression to name a few have driven the actions
    of portfolio managers and governments over the last two years.  Both agents (fund
    managers and governments) no matter how powerful or knowledgeable ultimately answer
    to the common man with all of his/her cognitive biases. Lately people have been
    very emotional and have demanded that the government “do something!” to address
    the current crisis. Blame must be assigned and villains must be villified–history
    is replete with identical reactions to every similar situation.  Inaction and
    intelligent study or reflection after such an event is completely unacceptable
    to the public. The same phenomenon exists after a rare but inevitable plane crash
    where the public immediately demands new safety regulations. Government and fiduciary
    (fund manager) actions and  must appeal to what the people want rather than what
    is optimal. There is no getting around this, and this means that volatility will
    always produce opportunity. To the quants who look at factors, or to the traders
    that look at backtests, remember that people create contrarian or momentum opportunities.
    When you hear about mass withdrawals and bank runs, and billion dollar scandals
    you can bet that few are behaving rationally. Mean-reversion strategies do best
    in an environment of uncertainty and fear, and momentum strategies do best in
    periods of optimism and euphoria or performance chasing (like right now). At all
    the states in between the market is fairly efficient, as rationality is most likely
    to dictate decision making.

    whether directly or indirectly, there will always be a huge impact  of their aggregate
    bias on the market. For this simple reason—or simplifying assumption—the markets
    can never by extension be completely efficient.
