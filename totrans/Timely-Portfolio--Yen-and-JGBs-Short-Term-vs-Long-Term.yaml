    overdone.  However, considering the short-term without regard to the long-term
    context is naïve and potentially dangerous.  Although I do not have significant
    proof, I believe long-term mean reversion can completely dominate short-term mean
    reversion hopes.  Just to provide some longer-term context, I thought I would
    offer some graphical aids.

    I think we need Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yields to move higher also, and
    if it does we are in a different paradigm than the last 20 years.  But, what do
    I know?
