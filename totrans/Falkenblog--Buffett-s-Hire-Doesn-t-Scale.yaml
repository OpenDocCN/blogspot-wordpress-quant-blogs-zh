    But a $100B fund doesn't need a stock picker, they need a deal-maker, a business
    manager, corporate strategist. Surely Buffett only grew into this role, starting
    as a pure stock picker, but he is truly

    focusing on banks. He did relatively well in 2007 and 2008, when he shorted banks,
    and has underperformed since. Indeed, his ''best'' year was in 2008, when he had
    a 5% loss: as I have argued repeatedly, relative risk is what truly matters, and
    if this is true the risk premium should not exist, which is consistent with reality.
    Ultimately, he has a very short resume, and from a Bayesian perspective, a guy
    who predicted an objectively improbable event--banks up to 2007 were relative
    outperformers--is probably a lucky crank, not a genius. The banking crisis, like
    every other crisis, was different. After all, if aliens come back on December
    21 2012 as the Mayans ''predicted'', the guys who will have seen it all coming
    are currently in their mom''s basement with tinfoil on their heads.'

    can''t short individual names to make much of a difference with $100B. Most things
    don''t scale, which is spider-man does not make any sense: just because a spider
    can lift 40 times his weight does not imply a 200 pound spider could lift 8000
    pounds. My family is organized using Marxist principles (''from each according
    to his ability...''), yet I don''t think for a minute this would work in my neighborhood,
    let alone nation.'

    $2B convertible bond fund. At $2B, he simply could not cherry-pick a large enough
    set of securities he could as a junior analyst asked to come up with 5 good trades.
    So, he basically took industry and duration bets when he became a portfolio manager,
    making his past experience rather irrelevant. His fund blew up during the first
    market contraction in his asset class, but he pocketed tens of millions of dollars.

    to manage $100B, because they are thinking about corporate strategy, like selling
    divisions, bankruptcy, mergers, finding CEO who are great or horrible.
