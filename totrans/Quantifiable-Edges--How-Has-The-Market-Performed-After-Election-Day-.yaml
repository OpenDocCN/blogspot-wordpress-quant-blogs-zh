- en: There is not a lot to glean from this.  But I would point out a couple of things. 
    1) Much of the negative total returns came thanks to the “Max Losing Trade”, which
    was 2008\. 2) The “Max Winning Trade” over the next week is barely 3%.  So the
    election has not in years past served as a spark that led to a sharp rally.
