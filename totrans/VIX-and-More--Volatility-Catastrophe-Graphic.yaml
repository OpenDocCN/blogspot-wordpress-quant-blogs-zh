    be exactly the right word here, but I needed a title with which to introduce the
    graphic below, which is a ratio of the VIX to the [3 month T-bill](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/3%20Month%20Treasury%20Bill)
    yield ([VIX:IRX ratio](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%3AIRX)).'

- en: The chart goes back to beginning of the VIX data in 1990 and even in a log scale
    demonstrates that the current environment is several orders of magnitude more
    concerning (at least from a volatility and flight to safety perspective) than
    any other day in the last 19 years.
