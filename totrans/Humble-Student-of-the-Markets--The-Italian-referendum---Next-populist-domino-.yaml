- en: of the Eurasia Group recently tweeted the following political calendar in Europe.
    After the surprising Trump win, the market is closely watching for electoral surprises.
    Next up is the Italian referendum on December 4, 2016, in which PM Matteo Renzi
    has asked for revisions to the constitution in order to break the endless cycle
    of deadlocked and changing governments. Italy has seen over 60 governments since
    the Second World War. Austria will also hold its presidential election on December
    4, in which far-right candidate Norbert Hofer is leading in the polls. The results
    are mitigated by the largely ceremonial nature of the presidential post.

    the Netherlands, in which anti-EU Freedom Party led by Geert Wilders is leading
    in the polls. The French presidential election will be held in the summer, where
    the anti-establishment candidate Marine Le Pen is expected to poll second heading
    into the run-off race. Finally, Germany will hold its election in late 2017.
