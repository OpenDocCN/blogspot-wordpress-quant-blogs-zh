- en: Toli of [Marketcetera](http://blog.marketcetera.com/) makes an [interesting
    point](http://blog.marketcetera.com/2008/07/18/myths-about-open-source/) about
    open source trading system – that the openness of the code base means that end
    users can make changes without having to show them to anyone else, whether vendors
    or peers. If you’re developing proprietary trading features, that’s a telling
    point.

- en: But I think Toli’s point doesn’t quite give us the whole story. How does an
    end user of an open source system get to the point where they can successfully
    hack the code ?  Quite often they’ll have to ask questions on a mailing list of
    peer developers. In the case of Marketcetera those peer developers will be Marketcetera’s
    own team as well as developers at buy side firms and dealers. Asking questions
    will reveal information to competing firms…
