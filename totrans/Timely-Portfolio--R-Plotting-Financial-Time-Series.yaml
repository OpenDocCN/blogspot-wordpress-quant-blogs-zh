- en: In my little world of finance, data almost always is a time series.  Through
    both quiet iteration and significant revolutions, the volunteers of R have made
    analyzing and charting time series pleasant.  As a mini-tribute to all those who
    have helped, I wanted to write a short history of R time series plotting, specifically
    focusing on financial time series.  I have embedded below, but it will look much
    better if you go to [Github pages version](http://timelyportfolio.github.io/rCharts_time_series/history.html).
