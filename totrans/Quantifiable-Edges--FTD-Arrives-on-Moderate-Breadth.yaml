- en: I looked at the impact of breadth on Follow Through Days (FTD). To compare breadth
    across market regimes, instead of using absolute breadth readings I use relative
    breadth readings. The study below uses the 1-yr Up Issues % Rank. This reading
    compares breadth versus all other days for the last year.  Despite the strong
    price action, Tuesday only ranked in the 84th percentile breadth-wise.  All stats
    are updated.

- en: As you can see, there is no discernible short-term impact from the FTD. The
    stat at the bottom is interesting, and suggests the bears may even have a slight
    intermediate-term edge when FTDs don’t include strong breadth participation. And
    for those that may be curious, the success rate rises to 52% when breadth comes
    in above the 95th percentile.
