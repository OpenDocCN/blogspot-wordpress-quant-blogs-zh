    no. In their words, ''we cannot reject the hypothesis that no fund managers have
    skill that enhances expected returns'', even after adding back their explicit
    costs.'

- en: Active fund managers are still way more popular than passive funds. At least,
    fund manager commissions no longer have a 8.5% load as they did until the 1970's.
    Index funds really took off in the 1980's, but still only have about 20% of the
    market. It is interesting that after such a long, consistent documentation of
    the failure of mutual fund managers, most people prefer to pay extra to add the
    idiosyncratic risk of the fund to their equity allocation.
