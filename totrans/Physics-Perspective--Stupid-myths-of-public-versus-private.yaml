    by some ideas floating around about how the private sector is sleek and efficient,
    risk taking etc, while the public sector is slow and wasteful, and almost none
    of this is based on any sound thinking or evidence. It''s propaganda almost entirely.
    Mazzucato helps dispel these myths and her thoughts should be promulgated far
    and wide:'

    with a dynamic and innovative private sector. This assumption lies at the basis
    of much of the outsourcing of public services to the private sector. In this interview

    Institute for New Economic Thinking grantee [**Mariana Mazzucato **](http://ineteconomics.org/people/mariana-mazzucato)argues
    against this assessment and in favour of state-led innovation and economic growth.
    She maintains that the public sector usually bears the highest risks of funding
    innovation without then reaping the rewards. *'

    that at most needs ‘unleashing’ from its constraints from the public sector. The
    latter is instead depicted as necessary for fixing ‘market failures’ (investing
    in ‘public goods’ like infrastructure or basic research) but inherently bureaucratic,
    slow, grey, and often too ‘meddling’. It is told to stick to the ‘basics’ but
    to avoid getting too directly involved in the economy.

    growing through innovation-led growth are countries where the state did not limit
    itself to just solving ‘market failures’ but actually developed strategic missions,
    and was active in directing public investment in particular areas with scale and
    scope, changing the technological and market landscape in the process. And ironically
    one of the government’s that have been most active on this front is the US government,
    which is usually depicted in the media (and by politicians) as being more ‘market
    oriented’. From putting a man on the moon, to developing what later became the
    Internet, the US government, through a host of different public agencies, provided
    direct financing not only of basic research but also applied research and even
    early stage public venture capital (indeed Apple received $500,000 directly from
    public funds). In each case it provided funding for the most high risk/uncertain
    investments, while the private sector sat waiting behind.

    Both Apple and the technologies behind the iPhone were picked! But picking winners
    is more probable when the state is described as though it is relevant rather than
    irrelevant. When government is given a mission, proper funding, and organizes
    its agencies so they are dynamic and able to ‘welcome’ the exploratory trial and
    error process that accompanies innovation, it can attract top expertise and dynamism.

    and through mission oriented policies. For example, China is spending $1.7 trillion
    on five key new broadly defined sectors, including ‘environmentally friendly’
    technologies. Brazil’s active state investment bank is spending more than $60
    billion just this year on green technology. The economics profession doesn’t adequately
    account for this kind of state-led activity, but only warns of governments ‘crowding
    out’ private business or failing at picking winners.

    out but crowding in business investment by creating a vision around it, and funding
    the most capital intensive areas with high market and technological risk. But
    we must also change the language. To me, ‘crowding in’ still sounds negative,
    as it is being compared to a benchmark of useless government. In my new book I
    go into this further, and suggest some new language and images that can really
    change the way we talk about and imagine the space for the public sector.

    that the state provides, we have not confronted a key relationship in finance:
    the relationship between risk and return. Innovation is deeply uncertain, with
    most attempts failing. For every Internet there are many Concordes or Solyndras.
    Yet this is also true for private venture capital (VC). But while private VC is
    then able to use the profits from the 1 out of 10 successes to fund the 9 losses,
    the state has not been allowed to reap a return. Economists think this will happen
    via tax (from the jobs created, and from the profits of the companies), yet so
    many of the companies that receive such benefits from state funding, bring their
    jobs elsewhere, and of course we know they also pay very little tax. Thus the
    return generating mechanisms must be rethought. It could be done through retaining
    equity, a ‘golden share’ of the intellectual property rights, or through income
    contingent loans. But currently this is not even discussed. When Google received
    funding for its algorithm from the National Science Foundation (NSF), is it right
    that after it earned billions nothing went back to the NSF (which is today starved
    of funds), or that some of Apple’s profits go into a national innovation fund
    to fund the next wave of Apples?'

    the rewards. This dynamic is one of the key drivers of increasing inequality.
    Because innovation today builds on innovation tomorrow, the ‘capture’ can be very
    large. This would not be the case if innovation were just a random walk. Policy
    makers must think very hard how to make value creation activities (done by all
    the collective actors in the innovation game) rewarded above value extraction
    activities (in this sense capital gains taxes are way too low). And since the
    booty from the latter can be very large, redirecting incentives and rewards towards
    the value creators is essential. The problem is that some of the ‘extractors’
    like to sell themselves as the creators.
