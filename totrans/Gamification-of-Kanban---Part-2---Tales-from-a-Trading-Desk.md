## Gamification of Kanban – Part 2

Ashish [Parkhi](https://ashishparkhi.com/about/) offer an interesting read on his experience of [gamification](https://ashishparkhi.com/2014/10/26/gamifying-agile-adoption-an-experiment/) of agile, “Gamifying Agile Adoption – An experiment”.  Some interesting behaviour from the experiment:

*   The team members started following processes well.
*   There was more interaction and collaboration between SD, QA, Product Owners and Product Managers.
