    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    signal. A bullish Trend Model signal that gets less bullish is a trading "sell"
    signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading
    "buy" signal. The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of
    the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. Past trading of
    the trading model has shown turnover rates of about 200% per month.

    of my thesis that an intermediate top is not imminent, most of the questions revolved
    around how far away the market top is. As well, there were some queries about
    equity downside risk in the next bear market.

    by economic recessions, how far away were previous market tops when the 9 quarter
    recession risk reached 30%, which is the current reading today?"

    that a simplistic application of historical studies can lead investors astray.
    In other words, history doesn't repeat itself, but rhymes.
