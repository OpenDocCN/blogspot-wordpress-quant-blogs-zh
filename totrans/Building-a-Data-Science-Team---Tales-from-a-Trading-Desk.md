## Building a Data Science Team

[Kaggle](http://blog.kaggle.com/) recently pointed me at an interesting [article](http://blog.kaggle.com/2016/09/06/building-a-team-from-the-inside-out-alok-gupta-on-the-evolution-of-data-science-at-airbnb/) on how Airbnb built their data science team, “Building a Team from the Inside Out: Alok Gupta on the Evolution of Data Science at Airbnb”.

There are a few interesting take aways from the article worth noting:

> centralized team of data scientists to smaller embedded teams which sit within product area

Data Scientist is broken down into 4 specialized roles:

*   Data engineers – They take messy data and transform it for analysis.
*   Product builders – People who build data products that are user-facing. For example, they may build a recommender engine.
*   Data analysts – They provide chief analyses outlining where opportunities lie for the business.
*   Data experimenters – Scientists who know how to design and perform an experiment.

A number of tools are referenced in the article:

Key however, seems to be Airbnb’s “knowledge sharing tool” that allows data scientists to “write up analyses from start to finish” – effectively a blog of research.  I would assume this comes with a fully repeatable way of anyone in Airbnb taking the research and branching down other roads, offering easy Return on Investment (ROI).  In many ways similar to Kaggle [Kernels](https://www.kaggle.com/kernels) and [Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets).  Some details of the Airbnb sharing knowledge pipeline are discussed [here](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/scaling-knowledge-at-airbnb-875d73eff091#.ijfg1r5ik).
