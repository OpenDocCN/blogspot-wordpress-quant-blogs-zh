    insurance regulation. Clearly the latter one will get rid of lots of little fiefdoms,
    but there is no reason these things should not be merged, it just makes it easier
    to do business when you have lots of different assets, and work across state lines.
    What if the FDA worked state by state? It's good to see these guys use this crisis
    to make some overdue reshuffling. Corporations have major reorganizations every
    5-10 years or so, implying the government can reorganize every 50 years or so.
