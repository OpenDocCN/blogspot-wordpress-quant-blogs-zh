    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    global easing cycle. The ECB signaled a dovish tone last week at its meeting.
    The EURUSD exchange rate weakened, and the USD Index strengthened. From a technical
    perspective, the USD is exhibiting bullish patterns on multiple time frames. The
    index staged an upside breakout on an inverse head and shoulders formation on
    the daily chart, with an upside measured upside target of about 99.10\. Conversely,
    EURUSD has broken down in a head and shoulders, with a downside target of about
    110.
