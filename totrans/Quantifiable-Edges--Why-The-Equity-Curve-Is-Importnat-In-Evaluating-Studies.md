# Quantifiable Edges: Why The Equity Curve Is Importnat In Evaluating Studies

> 来源：[http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2010/11/why-equity-curve-is-importnat-in.html#0001-01-01](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2010/11/why-equity-curve-is-importnat-in.html#0001-01-01)

While I don't always show it I do always look at the equity curve when evaluating studies to include in my analysis.  Last night while conducting my research I came across a great example of why this is important.

Inside days have generally suggested a bearish edge when the market is below the 200ma and no edge much better than upside drift when above the 200ma. I found it unusual that the inside day came with an unfilled gap down so I tested the possible effects under these circumstances.

At first glance the numbers seemed to suggest a downside edge. A closer look showed the numbers to be misleading. Here are the results in table format.

Base on this the next 1-3 days would seem to have a bearish inclination. But here is a picture of the equity curve.

As you can see it has been a long time since this setup has produced compelling odds.   Researchers should always take a look at the equity curve when considering whether to incorporate results into their analysis.
