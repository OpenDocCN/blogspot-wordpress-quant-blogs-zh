    housing bubble. In these programs, a home builder (D.R.Horton) giving a “gift”
    to the nonprofit (eg,

    for FHA guarantee! The FHA actually presumed this gift money was 'like' a down
    payment, and so then meant they didn't have much risk. Indeed, the FHA

    the mortgage support. This is a very complex set of favors that allow all sorts
    of butt-covering. Often, the house price is inflated by precisely the amount of
    the 'gift' (around 5%), so this is just a small little escrow for the builder.

    agencies involved in so much of this, it really defies credulity to think 'more
    regulation' would have prevented the crisis, as opposed to making it worse. While
    the FHA does not allow this practice, it still provides loans for people who merely
    have 3% of the house price to put into a down payment! For those arguing for 'more'
    regulation, does that mean more of these loans?
