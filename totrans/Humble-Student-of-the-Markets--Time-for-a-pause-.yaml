- en: Take a look at today's chart and you will see the concerning behavior we are
    talking about. First, note the Institutional Buying was a little higher on Friday,
    but it has essentially moved sideways since July 9th. Unlike the market in its
    buying binge, the Institutions have been merely "holding their own" relative to
    any new buying.

  zh: 看看今天的图表，你就会看到我们所说的令人担忧的行为。首先，注意周五的机构买入略有增加，但自7月9日以来基本上是横向移动。与市场的买入狂潮不同，机构只是“保持自己的地位”，相对于新的买入并没有太大变化。
- en: Now take a look what the Institutional Selling looks like. It didn't move sideways,
    it moved DOWN significantly.   This means that they sold less and less as the
    market went up.   That behavior "allowed" the market to go up on its own without
    any significant selling actions that would pull it down.

  zh: 现在看看机构卖出的情况。它没有横向移动，而是显著下降了。这意味着随着市场的上涨，他们卖出的越来越少。这种行为“允许”市场自行上涨，而没有卖出行动会将其拉低。
- en: From a behavioral standpoint, *allowing* the market to rise higher would benefit
    you if you wanted to sell at a greater profit later.   My point here is that the
    the Institutional Investors have not been participating in the current move, but
    have been acting as "enablers", allowing the market to move higher while not exhibiting
    actions that support it.

  zh: 从行为角度来看，*允许* 市场进一步上涨对你有利，如果你想在以后获得更大的利润。我的观点是，机构投资者并没有参与当前的涨势，而是充当了“助燃剂”的角色，在市场上涨时并没有表现出支持市场的行动。
