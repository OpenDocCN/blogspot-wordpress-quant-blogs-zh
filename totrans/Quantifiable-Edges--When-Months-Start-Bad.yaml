    decided to throw a curveball in June. These first two days have been a fairly
    rough start. I decided to see how SPY has historically reacted when the month
    got off to a bad start. For purposes of the test I shall define “bad start” as
    a down close the first 2 days and a loss of at least 1.5% over those two days.

    my least favorite from a trading perspective.) Still, combined with some other
    positives I’m seeing, such as
