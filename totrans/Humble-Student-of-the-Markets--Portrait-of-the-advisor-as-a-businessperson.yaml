    could spend the time to build up books of business and make a reasonable living

    designed by the firm to encourage certain kinds of behavior and discourage others.
    For example, if a client paid $100 in trading commission, the advisor will likely
    get paid less than if he steered the client into a certain type of mutual fund
    that paid recurring fees, especially now that most firms are encouraging their
    sales force to move from a stock trading business model to an asset gathering
    AUM model where the fees are recurring. Advisor compensation for fixed income

    $4M of new assets a decade ago would have been double-digit organic growth, yet

    possible client attrition, pressure on fees, and the fact that there were more
    retired clients taking withdrawals (rather than accumulators who would keep saving

- en: 'The bottom line, though, is simply this: while many have criticized the profit
    margins of advisory firms as being unjustly rich and generous, and therefore prone
    to disruption (e.g., from robo-advisors), ***the reality is that for a large number
    of advisory firms the profit margins actually may not be large enough to withstand
    the next bear market, especially given that firms have become so large that they
    can no longer just grow their way through with new clients as they have in the
    past.*** At best, most firms will likely find the next bear market to be the most
    traumatic ever as a firm owner, simply given the sheer operational leverage of
    today’s typical advisory firm… and for those who don’t have the profit margins
    nor the growth potential, many advisory firms may not even survive. Is your firm
    well positioned at its current size to withstand the next market downturn when
    it comes?'

  zh: 然而，说到底，事实很简单：尽管许多人批评咨询公司的利润率过高，过于丰厚，因此容易受到干扰（例如，来自机器人顾问的干扰），**但实际情况是，对于许多咨询公司来说，利润率实际上可能不足以承受下一轮熊市，尤其是考虑到公司已经变得如此之大，它们不能再像过去那样仅通过吸引新客户来实现增长。**
    最多，大多数公司可能会发现，下一轮熊市作为公司所有者来说是最具创伤性的，仅仅是因为今天典型咨询公司的运营杠杆…而对于那些既没有利润率也没有增长潜力的公司，许多咨询公司可能甚至无法生存。当市场低迷到来时，你的公司是否已经在其当前规模上做好了充分准备以应对呢？
- en: Here in Vancouver, home of the old "Vancouver Stock Exchange" where penny stocks
    were once bought and sold, there are still firms whose specialty is selling shares
    of junior companies and have not really migrated to the AUM fee-based model. For
    those firms, the bear market has been here with a vengeance for quite some time
    and we are seeing their effects in spades.

- en: The next major bear market is likely to be highly disruptive to the financial
    advisory industry. That's why many advisors are trying different things and struggling
    to find the next business model. It also partially explains the volatility of
    the NAAIM survey results - advisors are trying to find a new value proposition
    in order to better serve their clients and build a sustainable business for themselves.

  zh: 下一轮重大熊市很可能会对金融咨询行业产生巨大干扰。这就是为什么许多顾问正在尝试不同的事情，并努力寻找下一个业务模式的部分原因。这也部分解释了NAAIM调查结果的波动性——顾问们正在尝试找到一个新的价值主张，以便更好地服务他们的客户并为自己建立一个可持续的业务。
