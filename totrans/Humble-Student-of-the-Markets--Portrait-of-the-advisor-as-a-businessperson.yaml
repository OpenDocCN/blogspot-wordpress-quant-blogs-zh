    up several times in my discussions was that investment advisors are struggling
    with redefining their business models. To put in more simply, investment advisors
    are struggling to formulate a new business model and present a better value proposition
    for their practices. The wild swings in the NAAIM survey is explained by 1) survey
    data methodological problems and 2) advisors trying to add value in a differentiated
    fashion.

    to me this way, "I don`t work for XYZ, XYZ works for me." What he meant by that
    statement was that he uses his firm`s infrastructure to run his own small business,
    much like a franchisee at a restaurant chain.

    a fair number of potential clients as not everyone was in the market. Advisors
    could spend the time to build up books of business and make a reasonable living
    at their practice. Their pay depended on "the grid", which is a compensation system
    designed by the firm to encourage certain kinds of behavior and discourage others.
    For example, if a client paid $100 in trading commission, the advisor will likely
    get paid less than if he steered the client into a certain type of mutual fund
    that paid recurring fees, especially now that most firms are encouraging their
    sales force to move from a stock trading business model to an asset gathering
    AUM model where the fees are recurring. Advisor compensation for fixed income
    products, like tend be relatively lower. Often, the compensation for a GIC, regardless
    of size, will be a fixed dollar amount rather than one based on a percentage invested.

    advisor business model is threatened by discount brokers, which was virtually
    unheard of 30-40 years ago, online trading with all the tools that encourage DIY
    investors, the advent of low-cost ETFs, robo-advisors who threaten the advice
    business and so on. What's more, the market is now saturated. The twentysomething
    young advisor who comes out of school rarely succeeds in building a book in the
    same way his counterpart did 30+ years ago, largely because virtually everyone
    either has an advisor or is using one of the aforementioned solutions.

    model. The transition to an AUM and fee-based model is a start, but it`s not a
    complete solution. To explain, advisors used to be mainly stock brokers who pushed
    individual stock ideas to their clients. That approach suffered from recurring
    bouts of feast-and-famine cyclicality during bull and bear markets. In bull markets,
    clients traded a lot and volumes were high, but volumes shrank in bear markets
    and therefore broker compensation fell precipitously as a result. The transition
    to an AUM fee-based model has moderated some of that cyclicality, but doesn`t
    entirely solve the problem.

    in the late 1980s or early 1990s, the model only really began to become widely
    adopted in the early 2000s. Yet as the AUM model has become increasingly popular,
    and firms have had time to build, the “typical” advisory firm has grown significantly,
    from an average of only $25M of AUM in 2002 to more than $200M of AUM in 2013\.
    And with an average profit margin of about 22%, the typical advisory firm owner
    with an AUM practice is enjoying record take-home pay.

    paid based on his production on “the grid“, which maxes out at about 50% and goes
    down depending on the source of revenue, or financial product sold, and the total
    size of production and AUM. The dirty little secret of the financial advisory
    business is that exotic investments, derivatives and equity based products pay
    more while fixed income products pay less. Such a compensation scheme puts the
    practice at risk during the next equity bear market.

    growth rates seem to be slowing, a combination of both the ongoing crisis of differentiation
    for advisory firms, and the simple fact that as the firm gets bigger the denominator
    of the growth rate fraction is difficult to overcome; after all, adding “just”
    $4M of new assets a decade ago would have been double-digit organic growth, yet
    the same new asset flows yielded barely a 4% growth rate for a typical firm in
    2009 and would be less than a 2% growth rate for the average firm today!

    prior peak in the 3rd quarter of 2007\. Between declining assets from market returns,
    possible client attrition, pressure on fees, and the fact that there were more
    retired clients taking withdrawals (rather than accumulators who would keep saving
    into accounts), it just wasn’t feasible for most advisory firms to grow through
    the bear market. In other words, growth alone was no longer a sufficient defense
