    Such data make it possible to test some of the old chestnuts of market theory
    -- the efficient markets hypothesis, in particular -- more carefully than ever
    before. Studies in the past few years show quite clearly, it seems to me, that
    the EMH is very seriously misleading and isn't really even a good first approximation.

    the efficient markets idea. As the efficient markets hypothesis (the "weak" version,
    at least) claims, market prices fully reflect all publicly available information.
    When new information becomes available, prices respond. In the absence of new
    information, prices should remain more or less fixed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Striking evidence against this view comes from studies (now almost ten or twenty
    years old) showing that markets often make quite dramatic movements even in the
    *absence* of any news. I looked at some older studies along these lines in the
    last post, but stronger evidence comes from studies using electronic news feeds
    and high-frequency stock data. Are sudden jumps in prices in high frequency markets
    linked to the arrival of new information, as the EMH says? In a word -- no!

    "stand out" from what is typical, and then see if such movements might have been
    caused by some "news". A good example is

    R(t) is the minute by minute return for some stock. You might take the absolute
    value of these returns, average them over a couple hours and use this as a crude
    measure -- call it σ -- of the "typical size" of one-minute stock movements over
    this interval. An unusually big jump over any minute-long interval will be one
    for which the magnitude of R is much bigger than σ.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To make this more specific, Joulin and colleagues defined "s jumps" as jumps
    for which the ratio |R/σ| > s. The value of s can be 2 or 10 or anything you like.
    You can look at the data for different values of s, and the first thing the data
    shows -- and this isn't surprising -- is a distinctive pattern for the probability
    of observing jumps of size s. It falls off with increasing s, meaning that larger
    jumps are less likely, and the mathematical form is very simple -- a power law
    with P(s) being proportional to s

    in the figure below (the upper curve):'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This pattern reflects the well known "fat tailed" distribution of market returns,
    with large returns being much more likely than they would be if the statistics
    followed a Gaussian curve. Translating the numbers into daily events, s jumps
    of size s = 4 turn out to happen about 8 times each day, while larger jumps of
    s = 8 occur about once every day and one-half (this is true for each stock).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now the question is -- are these jumps linked to the announcement of some new
    information? To test this idea, Joulin and colleagues looked at various news feeds
    including feeds from Dow Jones and Reuters covering about 900 stocks. These can
    be automatically scanned for mention of any specific company, and then compared
    to price movements for that company. The first thing they found is that, on average,
    a new piece of news arrives for a company about once every 3 days. Given that
    a stock on average experiences one jump every day and one-half, this immediately
    implies an imbalance between the number of stock movements and the number of news
    items. There's not enough news to cause the jumps observed. Stocks move -- indeed,
    jump -- too frequently.

    market movements are sometimes but not always caused by news. The EMH is wrong,
    unless you want to make further excuses that there could have been news that caused
    the movement, and we just don''t recognize it or haven''t yet figured out what
    it is. But that seems like simply positing the existence of further epicycles.'

    two categories: A) those caused by news (clearly linked to some item in a news
    feed) and B) those unrelated to any news, it is then possible to look for any
    systematic differences in the way the market settled down after such a jump. The
    data show that the volatility of prices, just after a jump, becomes quite high;
    it then relaxes over time back to the average volatility before the jump. But
    the relaxation works differently depending on whether the jump was of type A or
    B: caused by news or not caused by news. The figure below shows how the volatility
    relaxes back to the norm first for jumps linked to news, and second to jumps not
    linked to news. The later shows a much slower relaxation:'

    follows a power-law in time σ(t) − σ(∞) ∝ t− β (see also [22, 23]). The exponent
    of the decay is, however, markedly different in the two cases: for news jumps,
    we find β ≈ 1, whereas for endogenous jumps one has β ≈ 1/2\. Our results are
    compatible with those of [22], who find β ≈ 0.35.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Of course, β ≈ 1/2 implies a much slower relaxation back to the norm (whatever
    that is!) than does β ≈ 1\. Hence, it seems that the market takes a longer time
    to get back to normal after a no-news jump, whereas it goes back to normal quite
    quickly after a news-related jump.

    speculation that a jump clearly related to news is not really surprising, and
    certainly not unnerving. It's understandable, and traders and investors can decide
    what they think it means and get on with their usual business. In contrast, a
    no-news event -- think of the Flash Crash, for example -- is very different. It
    is a real shock and presents a lingering unexplained mystery. It is unnerving
    and makes investors uneasy. The resulting uncertainty registers in high volatility.

    one might object that lots of news isn''t just linked to the fate of one company,
    but pertains to larger macroeconomic factors. It may not even mention a specific
    company but point to a likely rise in the prices of oil or semiconductors, changes
    influencing whole sectors of the economy and many stocks all at once. Joulin and
    colleagues tried to take this into account by looking for correlated jumps in
    the prices of multiple stocks, and indeed changes driven by this kind of news
    do show up quite frequently. But even accounting for this more broad-based kind
    of news, they still found that a large fraction of the price movements of individual
    stocks do not appear to be linked to anything coming in through news feeds. As
    they concluded in the paper:'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Our main result is indeed that most large jumps... are not related to any broadcasted
    news, even if we extend the notion of ‘news’ to a (possibly endogenous) collective
    market or sector jump. We find that the volatility pattern around jumps and around
    news is quite different, confirming that these are distinct market phenomena [17].
    We also provide direct evidence that large transaction volumes are not responsible
    for large price jumps, as also shown in [30]. We conjecture that most price jumps
    are in fact due to endogenous liquidity micro-crises [19], induced by order flow
    fluctuations in a situation close to vanishing outstanding liquidity.
