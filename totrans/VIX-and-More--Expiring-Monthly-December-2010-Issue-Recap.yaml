- en: This month’s issue has a feature article from Mark Sebastian on the future of
    options exchanges. On a related subject, Mark Longo interviews Gary Katz, President
    and CEO of the International Securities Exchange ([ISE](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/ISE)). 
    Additional subjects covered in the magazine include how market makers use volatility
    to update their quotes, delta hedging, analyzing opening gap tendencies, payment
    for order flow, directional vs. non-directional strategies, the role of luck and
    skill in trading, and a review of Ron Ianieri’s recent options book.

- en: I contribute two articles to the December issue. Unintentionally blurring zoomorphism
    with mythology, one article is based on a trade I call “the Minotaur” while the
    other has earned the name of “the Swan Catcher.” The Minotaur turns out to be
    a VIX-[VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX) pairs trade and here
    I embark on a proof-of-concept approach. The Swan Catcher trade also represents
    something of a bottoms-up approach to developing options strategies. In part one
    of a two-part series, I seek a way to structure options positions to profit from
    extreme moves in the market, without losing too much money while one waits for
    these events to occur.
