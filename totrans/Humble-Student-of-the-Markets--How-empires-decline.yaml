    Saturday to eliminate dozens of federal programs and offices while slashing agency
    budgets by as much as 40 percent, drawing out more than ***$60 billion in deficit

    part of a well-functioning democracy. A program like foreign aid that many Republicans
    and Tea Partiers hate are a miniscule percentage of the budget and its elimination
    wouldn't make a dent in the deficit. (Did you know that aid to Egypt took up a
    substantial amount of the foreign aid budget, ostensibly to buy geopolitical stability
    in the region? But then we don't talk about those things in polite company.)

    debt crisis by selling off revenue streams to foreign investors. The empire that
    suffered these setbacks in the 1870s was the Ottoman empire. Today it is the US.
    In the aftermath of the Crimean war, both the sultan in Constantinople and his
    Egyptian vassal, the khedive, had begun to accumulate huge domestic and foreign
    debts. Between 1855 and 1875, the Ottoman debt increased by a factor of 28\. As
    a percentage of expenditure, interest payments and amortisation rose from 15 per
    cent in 1860 to 50 per cent in 1875\. The Egyptian case was similar: between 1862
    and 1876, the total public debt rose from E£3.3m to E£76m. The 1876 budget showed
    debt charges accounting for more than half of all expenditure.'

    had opened in 1869\. But a dangerously high proportion of the proceeds had been
    squandered on conspicuous consumption, symbolised by Sultan Abdul Mejid''s luxurious
    Dolmabahçe palace and the spectacular world premiere of Aïda at the Cairo Opera
    House in 1871\. In the wake of the financial crisis that struck the European and
    American stock markets in 1873, a Middle Eastern debt crisis was inevit able.
    In October 1875 the Ottoman government declared bankruptcy.'
