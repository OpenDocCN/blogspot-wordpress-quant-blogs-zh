    economists call investment — roads, bridges, trains, ports, technology, factories
    and office buildings. That is the highest share in recorded history. During their
    great booms in the 1960s and ’70s, Japan and South Korea never topped 40 percent.
    China itself was spending 35 percent only a decade ago.

- en: Perhaps the most telling sign that China’s economic model is reaching its limits
    is a decline in its efficiency. To maintain 10 percent annual economic growth,
    it has had to invest more and more in roads, buildings and the like. In other
    words, the return on its investments has begun to fall, which is never a good
    sign. “We’ve got a problem,” Guo, the bank chairman, told me. “We realize this
    kind of growth is not sustainable. It’s not the kind of problem like a financial
    crisis. But if such inefficiencies accumulate for quite a long time, you reach
    the point where, suddenly, maybe things burst.”

    centralized country. “But China is a collection of special interests,” he said,
    “like the U.S.” Leaders understand that suppressing labor unrest may help economic
    growth in the short term by holding down wages and thus the price of exports.
    But many also know that economic discontent risks political instability of the
    kind that in the last century alone toppled an emperor and Chiang Kai-shek, led
    to the chaos of the Cultural Revolution and threatened the current regime in Tiananmen
    Square.

    risks of uneven global growth. Put simply, Americans consume too much and the
    Chinese consume too little. Indeed, the main planks of China's latest five year
    plan is to encourage more domestic consumer spending and to migrate up to the
    value-added ladder to more design oriented growth.

    the economic growth model means increasing efficiency, which involves Paul M.
    Romer’s New Growth theory, which is ***to improve total factor productivity and
    the knowledge content of growth.*** Transforming the economic growth model is
    really improving the efficiency of supply.

    Congress mainly implies three things. The first is the transformation of the aggregate
    demand structure, which means shifting from economic growth that relies on exports
    and investment to a model of balanced consumption, exports and investment.

- en: If China indeed experiences a rapid slowdown in GDP growth, the impact on the
    rest of the world may be far less than we expect. The real key is the evolution
    of the Chinese trade surplus. If it contracts, it will provide an expansionary
    boost to the rest of the world, not a contractionary one.

    is that global demand growth over the next several years is likely to be anemic
    with or without China. But it does man that a slowdown in Chinese growth might
    not be the disaster for the world that many believe.

- en: Also a rapid slowdown in Chinese growth does not mean a social or political
    disaster domestically It depends on how serious China is about rebalancing its
    economy. If policymakers are willing to force up interest rates and wages, most
    of the adjustment pain will be borne by SOEs and the state sector, not by the
    household sector. In that case we might see a slowdown in Chinese consumption
    growth, but one not nearly as severe as the slowdown in Chinese GDP growth. Since
    the Chinese, like everyone else, probably measures their well-being in terms of
    purchasing power per capita, rather than GDP per capita, a sharp slowdown might
    not be nearly as painful as we assume.
