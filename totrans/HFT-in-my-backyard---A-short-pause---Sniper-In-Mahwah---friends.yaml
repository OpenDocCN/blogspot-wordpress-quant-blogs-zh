- en: The Ofcom spectrum [website](http://spectruminfo.ofcom.org.uk/spectrumInfo/) being
    down, it’s nearly impossible to continue the “HFT in my back yard” series seriously.
    I have most of the data needed to finish Part IV, but I don’t want to write an
    incomplete account of Latent Networks – on which I just found the last “smart
    move”. What’s more, I discovered a new microwaves network here in my backyard.
    In fact, it’s an old one – to be honest, he never existed but the story if verrrrrrry
    interesting (in the end, I think I could write a little book about all this stuff).
    I still have to review some US legal documents (this if my new gig) and have to
    check if I can report publicly what I have found – I already entered a private
    property by visiting the Jump tower in Houtem, some FBI and US Defense people
    came to read my blog, so I don’t want do make things worse for myself – jail is
    not cool I think. Last but not least,  I have to finish a 4,000 words article
    for a French academic [journal](http://terrain.revues.org/2644) of anthropology
    about my first hypothesis regarding the “nature of market microstructure”, and
    I’m quite late (very late, in fact). So I’ll post Part IV early next week, hoping
    that the Ofcom website will be available again in the next few days.
