# Humble Student of the Markets: Things you don't see at market bottoms, Paris Hilton edition

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2017/09/things-you-dont-see-at-market-bottoms.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2017/09/things-you-dont-see-at-market-bottoms.html#0001-01-01)

 and

[Nearing the terminal phase of this equity bull](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2017/07/02/nearing-the-terminal-phase-of-this-equity-bull/)

). Nevertheless, psychology is getting a little frothy, which represent the pre-condition for a major top. This is just another post in a series of "things you don't see at market bottoms". Past editions of this series include:

As a result, I am publishing another edition of "things you don't see at market bottoms".
