- en: One item that appears to not be getting much web coverage (or maybe I’ve missed
    them) is around Blockchain Digital Identity – specifically in the corporate space.
     Take the example of two banks trading on the blockchain.  Bank A has n trades
    working for them, Trade A1 sells/buys with Trade B1 over at bank B.  Personal
    digital identity is important from a trader perspective, but the actual trade
    on the blockchain needs to be owned by the Bank.  Therefore you actually need
    both Bank and Trader identify on the blockchain.  Further, if the trader leaves
    the bank, the bank still owns the trade on the blockchain.  If the blockchain
    is permissioned, its likely the trade might only be able to see their subset of
    (bank) trades on the block chain.
