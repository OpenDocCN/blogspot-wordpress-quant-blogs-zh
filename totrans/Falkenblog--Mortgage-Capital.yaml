- en: Back in the late 1990's when I was allocating economic capital, residential
    mortgages had the lowest amount of risk assigned to any major loan category. Most
    asset classes had about 7-9% allocations, mortgages about 4%. But this made sense
    in 1999, because back then people had 20% down payments and verified income commensurate
    with their debt payments. One would have never guessed, back in 1999, that among
    all the things banks could invest in, mortgages would be the trouble area. The
    Commercial Real Estate debacle of 1990, or the oil patch lending problems in the
    1980's, or lending to South America, was considered the biggest risk.

    the 2000's based on my estimates of the new lending standards, or the increase
    in housing prices, but that's not obvious. After all, in 2005 even Robert Shiller

    arguing the new lending standards were basically the same, in that poor people
    are even more likely to sell everything to meet their monthly payments. The data
    at that time would have backed them up through 2006\. Further, we will be sued
    or will not meet our CRA lending targets if we don't apply them, so it would have
    been hard to say that risk went up 100% because of what our erstwhile regulators
    were encouraging us to do. Regulators don't encourage banks to invest more in
    risky areas, after all.

- en: In 1999, internet lending was primarily called 'structured' finance, and derided
    as 'air ball' lending because you lent based on the equity of the firm--an 'air
    ball' to experienced lenders. The collateral would only be counted on when it
    was by definition worthless. Banks had minimal exposure to this bubble, because
    they saw it coming.

    practices of banks. Having recently lost a boatload on residential mortgages,
    I suspect this will not be our problem area going forward. What is the current
    equivalent of residential mortgages circa 1999, the largest low risk asset on
    bank books? The only asset that did not explode in terms of its spread was US
    Treasuries. Given our new spending regime, poor demographics for social security,
    my best guess is that the banking sector's currently most riskless product is
    a good bet for our next lending cancer.
