    short run for several reasons. Simply put, this bull is getting tired and this
    latest up move is facing too many headwinds. First of all, the SPY to TLT ratio
    as a measure of the risk-on/risk-off trade is also testing a relative resistance
    level and showing a near overbought reading where stocks have retreated in the
    past.

    this historical pattern.

    by large cap multi-national companies. In that context, the outperformance of
    the NYSE Composite, which is more reflective of small and mid cap stocks, is consistent
    with that thesis.

    Last quarter was a minefield for corporations. If the complete story -- earnings,
    revenue, outlook -- was not perfect, the stock price moved lower. I avoided earnings
    dates in our most aggressive trading programs, and I was nearly always right.

    will not be great. Much of the uncertainty has been lifted. We know the election
    result and also tax policy for the near future. Will companies provide a little
    more guidance? What will it be?

    pundits with opinions but absolutely no record. I understand that analysts are
    too bullish in their multi-year forecasts -- basically following trends with no
    allowance for bad news. I also understand that by the time earnings are actually
    reported, the bar has been lowered so that more than 60% of companies beat expectations.

    to see the market advance too much further in the short-term. I believe that we
    are likely to see a pullback at these levels. The bulls will have to watch how
    the market behaves in response to news, such as the upcoming Earnings Season and
    the political posturing that is likely to occur over the Debt Ceiling, in order
    to discern the likely direction of the next major move.
