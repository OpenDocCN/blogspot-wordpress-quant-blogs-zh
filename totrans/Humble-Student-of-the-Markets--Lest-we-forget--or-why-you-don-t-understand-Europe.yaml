    as the European powers. So let me give my American friends some context. In a
    single battle for the Verdun fortress, which spanned several years, the casualties
    of both sides approached a million men. Compare and contrast those figures to
    American casualties in Vietnam and Korea.

    see the names of the 56K US service members who lost their lives in that conflict.
    If the same proportion of war dead to population for Canada in the First World
    War were to be applied to the US losses in the Vietnam War, the equivalent figure
    would be roughly 2.5 million dead, or 45 times the actual count.

    We have seen no major European conflict since 1945, the end of the Second World
    War. The formation of the European Union has kept the peace. The political elite
    of Europe, despite all the bickering, are still committed to that bigger than
    life myth of the formation of the EU.
