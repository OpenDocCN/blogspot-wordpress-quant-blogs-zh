- en: The State's control of the banking system had led to artificially low interest
    rates for the household sector and resulted in financial repression in the following
    form. The ordinary Zhangs in China's household had few avenues for excess savings.
    If he put it into the banking system, he got negative real interest rates (financial
    repression). The stock market is tiny and amounts to little more than a casino;
    there was no bond market to speak of; and there were limited ways of taking money
    out of the country. Meanwhile, the state owned banks lent to the SOEs at below
    market rates, because of the banks' cheap funding, and the SOEs, having also benefited
    from fixed prices and little or no competition, made out like bandits - as did
    the Party insiders running these enterprises. The household sector channeled its
    savings to the only place it could - property. In effect, financial repression
    led to an enormous property and credit bubble in China.

- en: I believed for a long time that China would have a soft landing. When its economy
    began to descend in 2012, fear of a hard landing permeated financial markets for
    several months. My view on a soft landing was based on the dominance of bank loans
    in credit creation. The country's banks are government-owned. When property developers
    face a liquidity crunch, the banks are likely to reschedule their loans. A hard
    landing is a consequence of the snowball effect from creditors liquidating delinquent
    borrowers. When there is a big bubble funded by debt, as is usually the case,
    its bursting would lead to a hard landing if the credit agreements are stuck to.
    Hence, a soft landing is usually due to either an inability or unwillingness of
    creditors to enforce debt contracts. Japan, for example, was in such a situation
    in the 1990s.

- en: The carry trade is the most important and speculative force in international
    capital flows. Interest rates are different in different currencies and the across
    spectrum of credit quality. When the interest rate is higher in one currency than
    in another, it usually reflects a higher inflation rate in the former, which would
    lead to its depreciation against the latter. The interest rate difference reflects
    the inflation difference and the former's depreciation. Similarly, when two bonds
    have different interest rates, the difference reflects their different bankruptcy
    probability. Because currency depreciation and corporate bankruptcy happen infrequently,
    many investors or speculators cannot resist the temptation of arbitraging interest
    rate differences.

    ongoing speculation. Nearly half of the credit growth this year can be classified
    as that. As such financing is usually short term, the speculative game depends
    on rollover confidence, as the underlying assets need years to become liquid.
    The confidence depends on faith in land prices surging for years to come. Such
    confidence is on thin ice to begin with because it is only working in big cities
    currently, and small and medium-sized cities are all facing difficulties. Any
    psychological shock could trigger rollover failures.

    a severe liquidity squeeze. Janet Yellen, the new Fed chairwoman, has expressed
    her disregard for asset bubbles and determination to push on until either the
    unemployment rate falls below the Fed's target or inflation breaches the Fed's
    limit. It is likely that either or both could be breached in 2014\. It may mean

    it doesn't fall, then the market doesn't believe that listed companies are likely
    to feel much pain. In that case, we could be setting ourselves up for a crash
    down the road, possibly triggered by a Fed taper as postulated by Andy Xie.
