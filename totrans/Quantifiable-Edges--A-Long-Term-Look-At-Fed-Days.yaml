    include non-scheduled meetings. Those are generally surprise rate cuts that are
    aimed at boosting the market. They’re inherently bullish yet unpredictable since
    the meetings aren’t scheduled. Therefore there is no point in including them in
    this study.

    day has ourperformed the average day by about 7.5 times.
