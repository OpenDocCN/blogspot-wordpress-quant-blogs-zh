    someone indicated “mean reverting strategies no longer work”.    I don’t agree
    with this at all.    However, there has been a lot of risk aversion and the market
    movements of the last few months (well since Feb or March) have been quite different
    then those preceding.    The market of the last few months has been ideal for
    market making given the tight bands and much less favorable for strategies that
    rely on trends or big swings.

    across a large portfolio.   When MR behavior in the market is “cranked back” it
    makes sense to filter the portfolio, increasing the chance of successful trades
    and reducing possible losses from assets without the desired footprint.
