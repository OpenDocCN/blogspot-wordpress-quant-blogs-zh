    moving average variants across a number of markets by moving average length. It
    is worth noting that recency-weighting (wma) tends to perform better on average
    than the less responsive but smoothed triangular wma. Note that the weighted moving
    average and triangular moving average are not highly correlated in terms of performance
    across lookbacks which demonstrates their complementary nature for an adaptive
    framework:'
