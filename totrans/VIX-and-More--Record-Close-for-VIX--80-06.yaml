- en: With the VIX under 75 and only ten minutes left in the trading day, it looked
    like volatility was on the wane, but aggressive selling into the close dropped
    the DJIA 200 points and helped to push the VIX up over the 80 during the extra
    15 minutes of index options trading.

    16 trading days that the VIX has registered a new record close.
