# Humble Student of the Markets: For commodity bulls

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2009/04/for-commodity-bulls.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2009/04/for-commodity-bulls.html#0001-01-01)

I began

*Humble Student of the Markets*

as a way of putting down my thoughts on the markets, quant funds, investment processes and hedge funds. These are only my thoughts and I have no other agenda. The audience for those topics can be somewhat divergent and topics that interest one group may not be of interest to others.

**A weekly newsletter for commodity bulls**

Long time readers know that I remain a long-term commodity bull, although I am at odds with a number of gold bugs because gold is not a religion for me. I am experimenting with writing longer pieces on commodity trends on a weekly basis that are really too long to be posted here.

I will be emailing them to a number of contacts that I know and it is free.

If you would like to get on the email list please drop me a line at

**cam at hbhinvestments.com**

. I promise that I will keep your email address to myself and won’t give, sell or rent your email away to anyone.

The first post will be entitled

***An investment for the gold bull daredevil***

, to be sent out this weekend.
