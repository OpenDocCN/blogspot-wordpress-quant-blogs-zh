    between time and ensemble averages. A few comments suggest that some people I
    have "lost the plot," but I''m convinced this issue is indeed extremely important
    and generally underappreciated. A few things to add for now:'

    out the main issues and linking them to the Kelly criterion: a practical criterion
    for playing risky gambles that is based explicitly on time averages. Lars couldn''t
    have explained the basic ideas more clearly.'

- en: 2\. From some comments on other blogs, similar to some I've seen here, many
    people familiar with probability theory find it hard to accept that a time average
    expected return of a random multiplicative process is just not equal to the (usual)
    expected return of a single round. It isn't. Start with any number you like, multiply
    it by a long sequence of numbers, each either 0.9 or 1.1 drawn with equal probability,
    and you will find that the number tends to get smaller. In the limit of an infinite
    sequence, the result heads to 0\. And the result quoted in the Towers and Watson
    paper, a 1% decline on average per period, is correct.

    proposed in 1957 (The Journal of Finance, 12, 348–363) and is discussed by Szezkely
    and Richards (The American Statistician, 2004, Vol. 58, No. 3).

    for the past 77 years (just one?) but mathematicians working in finance have generally
    ignored Samuelson's attacks on logarithmic utility. Poundstone's book on the Kelly
    Criterion is a good description of the battle in the 1960s and I there is a rich
    contemporary literature that develops Kelly's ideas...

    that Peters has gone considerably further than Durand.
