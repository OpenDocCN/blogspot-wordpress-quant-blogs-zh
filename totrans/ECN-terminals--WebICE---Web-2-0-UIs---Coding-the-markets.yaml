- en: I had a look at the [WebICE demo](https://www.theice.com/ice_platform.jhtml)
    today, and was impressed. All of the dealer to client fixed income ECNs my employer
    trades on have fat client GUIs. [Bloomberg](http://www.bloomberg.com), [TradeWeb](http://www.tradeweb.com)
    & [BondVision](http://www.bondvision.net) all need to be installed on a trader’s
    PC. The WebICE demo appears to be just a Flash movie, but gives the impression
    of a rich but lightweight Web 2.0 GUI. For some time I’ve been wondering when
    an ECN would launch a Web 2.0 GUI based on [OpenLaszlo](http://www.openlaszlo.org/)
    or [Flex](http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/). IT departments at banks would
    welcome it as it would avoid the packaging and installation hassles of heavyweight
    client apps, and it would be good for the ECNs as client onboarding would be eased.

    proprietary single dealer platforms. [JPMorganExpress](http://www.jpmorganexpress.com)
    and [DRKWRevolution](http://www.drkwrevolution.com) and the other proprietary
    platforms all seem to have been built with Java.
