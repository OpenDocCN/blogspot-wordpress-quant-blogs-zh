- en: Last Friday’s post, [Can Selling Options Make You a Better Trader?](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/03/can-selling-options-make-you-better.html)
    prompted quite a few emails and comments, including a request that I share some
    of my [trading rules](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/trading%20rules).

- en: To be perfectly honest, I used to keep a list of trading rules handy to refer
    to at all times, but this is no longer the case. The rules are still valid, but
    after five years of full-time trading, I have retrained myself in the way I think
    about, react emotionally to and ultimately respond to the markets.

- en: I do think, however, that the process of developing and codifying a set of trading
    rules and guidelines is one of the most important exercises that a new or inexperienced
    trader can undertake. Also, I firmly believe that veteran traders should constantly
    be evaluating their beliefs about the markets they trade and the guiding principles
    that provide the basis for various approaches to trading.

- en: Before I decided to make trading a full-time business, I sat down and attempted
    to capture most of my beliefs about the markets. I originally started out with
    about 80 "axioms" (beliefs would probably be a more accurate term) and as I traded,
    I added to this list.

    that have changed only slightly since then.

    for organizing how I would approach trading as a business, what strategies I should
    adopt, how those strategies should be executed, and ultimately defining what success
    should look like.

- en: Trading rules are vitally important – as is knowing when they should be broken.
    Even more important, I believe, is the process that one goes through in order
    to arrive at these rules and to make sure that as new market situations unfold
    and new blind spots are revealed, the rules and guidelines are enhanced to maximize
    the opportunity for the trader to continue to grow and develop.
