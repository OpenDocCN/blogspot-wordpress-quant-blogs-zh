# Quantifiable Edges: What The 2-day Gap Pattern In SPY Suggests For The Next Few Days

> 来源：[http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2012/04/what-2-day-gap-pattern-in-spy-suggests.html#0001-01-01](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2012/04/what-2-day-gap-pattern-in-spy-suggests.html#0001-01-01)

Unfilled gaps can be a signal of strength in the direction of the gap.  But when they are quickly reversed by a sign of weakness that can suggest the first move was false.  Friday's unfilled gap up in SPY was a sign of strength.  Monday's unfilled gap down was a sign of weakness.  This suggests Friday's move was false.  Unfilled gaps down that directly follow unfilled gaps up have historically led to further short-term weakness.  This can be seen in the study below.

The edge has primarily play out over the next 3 days.  Of course with AAPL earnings, Wednesday's Fed Day, and European news flows there are a lot of outside forces that could impact the market over the next few days.  But the action over the last 2 days will likely weigh on the market.
