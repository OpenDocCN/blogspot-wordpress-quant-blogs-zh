    very good calls. For example, Dana Telsey had a buy on J. Crew in January, and
    by September 14 it was up 154%. Betsy Graseck recommended a sell on Bank of America
    in the fourth quarter of 2008,, and by March it had fallen 80%. It's always that
    way, where the best analysts are those with a handful of awesome picks over the
    past year (some Bloomberg promotions explicitly exclude losers, looking just for
    biggest winners).

    analysts and firms, as firms would reward investment banks who touted their stocks
    with investment banking business (issuing equity, debt, or doing mergers& acquisitions),
    so a better study would simply ignore the pre-2003 data. There are many screens

    who predicted it. That seems natural enough, but here we are with a very rare
    event, and there are always permabears, so when a bear market happens, these guys
    are all geniuses?

    work has a statistically valid sample size. It would be such a small sample of
    analysts with a valid sample, it would be bad for selling magazines, which are
    mainly read by those they are highlighting. So, taking those who were above average
    recently seems better than taking a random sample, even if the last year is a
    noisy estimate of true value. But these analysts are up against the much maligned
    Efficient Markets Hypothesis, and they generally don't do that well. Analyst stock
    reports, like economist forecasts, are mainly useful in rationalizing a decision
    you already made, but need to articulate better to your boss or clients.

    only the 'top' analysts are given prominent exposure in financial industry publications,
    is to focus on sexy stocks, those that can rise a lot. A low-volatility company
    has little chance of producing a return that will win a 1-year contest even if
    it goes up, so you might as well ignore it. Thus, everyone is focused on the risky
    stocks. As most people do not short stocks, the inordinate attention to risky
    stocks leads to a winner's curse in risky stocks, inflating their price, lowering
    their future return. This,
