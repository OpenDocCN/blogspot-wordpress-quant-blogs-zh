    “The Complexity of High Frequency Trading” which provides an interesting read
    on the complexities of the market.  Rule 610, part of the Cancel Spam problem.

    the new order types are *“**perks sold to them by the exchanges – including colocation,
    data feeds, and dubious order types – to make sure that they maximize the number
    of free shots at a risk free rebate**.*This means *they want to bid and be first
    in line, and only when they are assured that there are other buyers deep behind
    them**,* and collect rebates.  If they are successful and buy stock and collect
    a rebate, they can turn around and instantly sell that stock at the same price
    to the person behind them, still making a profit*. **This is not liquidity provision.  **They
    game ways to be at the top of the book in stocks that already have the liquidity
    that serves as a backstop**.”*
