    Realize that this framework is based on technical analysis and not economic analysis.
    A market cycle behaves like an economic cycle, but it only describes the market
    response to expectations, not the actual economic result. As an example, the economic
    cycle started at the trough of the Lehman Crisis in 2008-09, but I believe that
    the market cycle actually began in late 2011, when the markets got over the trauma
