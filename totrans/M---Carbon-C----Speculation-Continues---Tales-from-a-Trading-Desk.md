## M#, Carbon C++, Speculation Continues

Anyone who’s read Joe Duffy’s 2014 blog [postings](http://joeduffyblog.com/2013/12/27/csharp-for-systems-programming/) knows that there is something brewing in the Microsoft compiler and language department.  What language the new language will be based on (C#, or maybe C++) isn’t clear, or the name of said language.  Channel 9 [forum’s](https://channel9.msdn.com/Forums/Coffeehouse/new-info-around-Midori-team?page=3) offers some thoughts based on LinkedIn profiles etc.  Will anything be said about the new language at [Build](http://www.buildwindows.com/) 2015 conference?  Or will we have to continue waiting for some while longer for Joe to post another titbit of information?
