    around the memory available on Microsoft Surface devices, its clear the [128GB](http://www.engadget.com/2013/02/15/microsoft-128gb-surface-pro-pre-order/)
    version is the only viable enterprise device for anyone corporation consider such
    devices.

    Microsoft Surface and Windows 8 at an enterprise level.  Given a vast majority
    of corporates in the capital market space run Windows desktops, the ease of adopting
    a Microsoft Surface Win8 device is obvious.  Especially if consider in terms of
    the sales/trader desktop tools already built that are often built using Microsoft
    .NET (think WPF).  As blogged about a long time ago, traders/sales often find
    it hard to leave the trading desk due to the “data” available though there 4-8
    monitors.  iPad’s offer a way to carry real-time data with them when they are
    in meetings away from the trading desk.  But the iPad requires either remote desktop
    software, or an iOS/HTML variant of the heavy desktop application to work on the
    Apple device.  Hence the possible advantage Microsoft could have with the Microsoft
    Surface device in the capital markets corporate.

    onto the Microsoft Surface. [“Sideload”](http://www.howtogeek.com/129535/how-to-sideload-modern-apps-on-windows-8/)
    appears to be the Windows Store by-pass  intended for developers and internal
    business applications.  For in-depth details of how to leverage Sideload, try
