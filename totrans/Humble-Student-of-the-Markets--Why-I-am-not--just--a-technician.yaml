    breadth is the story of the generals and the troops. You would like to see an
    army (the market) advancing with the troops (all stocks) moving in the same direction.
    If the generals (large caps) are leading but the troops (broader market) are not
    following, then we have a picture of narrowing leadership and a warning of an
    unsustainable rally.

    indicators have had a mixed record at calling market direction.

    They incorrectly turned bullish with a series of higher highs and high lows during

    panel. If you followed small cap divergence as a market timing tool, you would
    have missed the entire Tech bull market of the late 1990's (being short during
    those five years would have been extremely painful and likely a career ending
    exercise). Moreover, you would have bought the market after the Tech Bubble popped

    between US large caps and small caps. Large cap companies tend to be more international
    in scope and do more of their business outside the US. As it turns out, the relative
    performance of small to large caps correlate very well with the US Dollar (blue
    line, middle panel). A falling USD benefits large caps, because their margins
    expand because of their non-US sales, while a rising USD hurts large caps and
    benefits small caps.

    a lot of the currency effect observed in the Russell 2000/SP 500 ratio. It turns
    out that the SPX/OEX ratio roughly mirrors the relative performance of the Russell
    2000/SP 500\. I marked the divergences in blue, where the signals worked, and

    early. Anyone using II sentiment for market timing would have missed most of the

    identify the top in 2007, it bought far too early and anyone following this model
    would have suffered through the Lehman Crisis crash. After the Crash, it flashed
    a series a sell signals and was far too cautious, only to get long at the 2011
    bottom and selling in late 2013\. II bull/bear readings seem to have moved to
