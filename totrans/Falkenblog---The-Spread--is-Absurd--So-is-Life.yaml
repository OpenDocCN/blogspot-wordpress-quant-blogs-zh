    their allotted time. Watching high school and college debates use this, it seems
    absurd. The objective is to present the maximum number of arguments in a debate
    round, hoping that a few unrebutted points seem like concessions to judges. Quality
    and consistency, are not priorities. I suppose in debate the judges merely read
    the arguments, because it seems impossible to process these statements (see below).'

    and several intimations were made in the original complaint but they were not
    exhaustive. The problem is that litigation is very expensive (IP lawyers are $500/hour),
    and there's an opportunity cost because as long as you are accused of appropriating
    undescribed IP, no one with any money would dare hire or work with you. So, you
    want to get it done. However, they can say 'you took the idea of investing in
    low volatility stocks', and by the time you mention you did this at a prior job,
    they then say '...in a particular way', and add on several other items, such as
    the concept of 'mean variance optimization', etc. You can knock these down one
    by one, but the longer you play the more you lose.

    penalized for making absurd allegations, they just hope at least one remains viable.
    My lawyers then leveled some counter-arguments I found were irrelevant, but they
    noted you never know what arguments work, that is, which might resonate with the
    judge. Restricting one's counter-suite was suboptimal. Real life was an absurd
    spread debate I had to play.

- en: on how to reform the governmental housing system, and one Janneke Ratcliffe
    made several remarkable assertions, including that low-down payment mortgages
    on some subset of loans did above average over the past decade, implying to her
    that low down payments were not a problem. I'm sure there is such a subset of
    loans, but in the context of the fact that default rates are multidimensional
    this is unsurprising--you can find subets of fat men who are actually quite healthy,
    but on average at the margin obesity is not healthy. The point is, she made an
    assertion to some atypical finding, presented it as a fact that was dispositive
    of her assertion, and it sat out there as evidence because no one could, in the
    time presented, review and rebut it.

    political science, economics, sociology, history, and mentions several disparate
    facts in each of these domains. The key to being persuasive seems to be to have
    an argument that is irrefutable, because no fact is essential, and they are so
    disparate facts no one can refute a significant proportion of them definitively.
    That is, appearing to have a fusillade of facts is overwhelming. So, the big issue
    (eg, anarcho-syndicalism? Capitalism is evil?) is promoted via thousands of supporting
    facts. You don't have enough time, and no one has the breadth, to evaluate all
    of them, and merely refuting a finite subset leaves open the logical possibility
    he's correct on his big point.

    really statements about relations between datapoints. As there are an infinite
    number of relational facts, you can’t expect to know them all even if you know
    all the basic data points, so certainly you can't easily rebut them all. So everyone
    knows only a different subset of the relations, which gives them different ‘facts’.
    There's no simple way to reconcile them, because there are so man facts, each
    supportive in their own way.

    not hard to make a case for anything, which is why a good lawyer always helps.
    It also explains why people don't converge on the truth, because once you are
    a valued advocate for X, the payoffs from others who like X are surely better
    than recognizing that X is, in fact, false (plus, presumably after so many years
    most of your friends and colleagues are X-lovers).
