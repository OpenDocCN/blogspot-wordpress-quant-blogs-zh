- en: ''', where a speaker speed reads the broadest number of arguments possible in
    their allotted time. Watching high school and college debates use this, it seems
    absurd. The objective is to present the maximum number of arguments in a debate
    round, hoping that a few unrebutted points seem like concessions to judges. Quality
    and consistency, are not priorities. I suppose in debate the judges merely read
    the arguments, because it seems impossible to process these statements (see below).'

- en: . I was being accused of appropriating some unspecified intellectual property,
    and several intimations were made in the original complaint but they were not
    exhaustive. The problem is that litigation is very expensive (IP lawyers are $500/hour),
    and there's an opportunity cost because as long as you are accused of appropriating
    undescribed IP, no one with any money would dare hire or work with you. So, you
    want to get it done. However, they can say 'you took the idea of investing in
    low volatility stocks', and by the time you mention you did this at a prior job,
    they then say '...in a particular way', and add on several other items, such as
    the concept of 'mean variance optimization', etc. You can knock these down one
    by one, but the longer you play the more you lose.

  zh: 。我被指控侵占了一些未指明的知识产权，原告在起诉书中提出了几点暗示，但它们并不详尽。问题在于诉讼非常昂贵（知识产权律师每小时收费500美元），而且还有机会成本，因为只要你被指控侵占未描述的知识产权，没有人会敢于雇佣你或与你合作。所以，你想解决问题。然而，他们可以说'你借鉴了低波动性股票投资的想法'，当你提到你在以前的工作中做过这件事时，他们随后会说'...以某种特定的方式'，并添加其他几个项目，比如'均值方差优化'的概念等。你可以一一打破这些观点，但是你玩得越久，失去的就越多。
- en: The judge, meanwhile, looks at every allegation piecemeal, so that they aren't
    penalized for making absurd allegations, they just hope at least one remains viable.
    My lawyers then leveled some counter-arguments I found were irrelevant, but they
    noted you never know what arguments work, that is, which might resonate with the
    judge. Restricting one's counter-suite was suboptimal. Real life was an absurd
    spread debate I had to play.

  zh: 与此同时，法官逐条审查每一项指控，以便他们不会因提出荒谬的指控而受到惩罚，他们只是希望至少有一项指控保持有效。我的律师们随后提出了一些我认为不相关的反驳观点，但他们指出你永远不知道哪些论点有效，也就是说，哪些可能会引起法官共鸣。限制自己的反诉套件是次优的。现实生活就像我不得不参与的一个荒谬的传播辩论。

- en: on how to reform the governmental housing system, and one Janneke Ratcliffe
    made several remarkable assertions, including that low-down payment mortgages
    on some subset of loans did above average over the past decade, implying to her
    that low down payments were not a problem. I'm sure there is such a subset of
    loans, but in the context of the fact that default rates are multidimensional
    this is unsurprising--you can find subets of fat men who are actually quite healthy,
    but on average at the margin obesity is not healthy. The point is, she made an
    assertion to some atypical finding, presented it as a fact that was dispositive
    of her assertion, and it sat out there as evidence because no one could, in the
    time presented, review and rebut it.

- en: If you ever watch a speech by Noam Chomksy you'll note his discussion crosses
    political science, economics, sociology, history, and mentions several disparate
    facts in each of these domains. The key to being persuasive seems to be to have
    an argument that is irrefutable, because no fact is essential, and they are so
    disparate facts no one can refute a significant proportion of them definitively.
    That is, appearing to have a fusillade of facts is overwhelming. So, the big issue
    (eg, anarcho-syndicalism? Capitalism is evil?) is promoted via thousands of supporting
    facts. You don't have enough time, and no one has the breadth, to evaluate all
    of them, and merely refuting a finite subset leaves open the logical possibility
    he's correct on his big point.

    really statements about relations between datapoints. As there are an infinite
    number of relational facts, you can’t expect to know them all even if you know
    all the basic data points, so certainly you can't easily rebut them all. So everyone
    knows only a different subset of the relations, which gives them different ‘facts’.
    There's no simple way to reconcile them, because there are so man facts, each
    supportive in their own way.

    not hard to make a case for anything, which is why a good lawyer always helps.
    It also explains why people don't converge on the truth, because once you are
    a valued advocate for X, the payoffs from others who like X are surely better
    than recognizing that X is, in fact, false (plus, presumably after so many years
    most of your friends and colleagues are X-lovers).
