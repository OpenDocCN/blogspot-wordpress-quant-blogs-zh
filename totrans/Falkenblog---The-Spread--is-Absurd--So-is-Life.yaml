    and several intimations were made in the original complaint but they were not
    exhaustive. The problem is that litigation is very expensive (IP lawyers are $500/hour),
    and there's an opportunity cost because as long as you are accused of appropriating
    undescribed IP, no one with any money would dare hire or work with you. So, you
    want to get it done. However, they can say 'you took the idea of investing in
    low volatility stocks', and by the time you mention you did this at a prior job,
    they then say '...in a particular way', and add on several other items, such as
    the concept of 'mean variance optimization', etc. You can knock these down one
    by one, but the longer you play the more you lose.

  zh: 。我被指控侵占了一些未指明的知识产权，原告在起诉书中提出了几点暗示，但它们并不详尽。问题在于诉讼非常昂贵（知识产权律师每小时收费500美元），而且还有机会成本，因为只要你被指控侵占未描述的知识产权，没有人会敢于雇佣你或与你合作。所以，你想解决问题。然而，他们可以说'你借鉴了低波动性股票投资的想法'，当你提到你在以前的工作中做过这件事时，他们随后会说'...以某种特定的方式'，并添加其他几个项目，比如'均值方差优化'的概念等。你可以一一打破这些观点，但是你玩得越久，失去的就越多。

    made several remarkable assertions, including that low-down payment mortgages
    on some subset of loans did above average over the past decade, implying to her
    that low down payments were not a problem. I'm sure there is such a subset of
    loans, but in the context of the fact that default rates are multidimensional
    this is unsurprising--you can find subets of fat men who are actually quite healthy,
    but on average at the margin obesity is not healthy. The point is, she made an
    assertion to some atypical finding, presented it as a fact that was dispositive
    of her assertion, and it sat out there as evidence because no one could, in the
    time presented, review and rebut it.

- en: If you ever watch a speech by Noam Chomksy you'll note his discussion crosses
    political science, economics, sociology, history, and mentions several disparate
    facts in each of these domains. The key to being persuasive seems to be to have
    an argument that is irrefutable, because no fact is essential, and they are so
    disparate facts no one can refute a significant proportion of them definitively.
    That is, appearing to have a fusillade of facts is overwhelming. So, the big issue
    (eg, anarcho-syndicalism? Capitalism is evil?) is promoted via thousands of supporting
    facts. You don't have enough time, and no one has the breadth, to evaluate all
    of them, and merely refuting a finite subset leaves open the logical possibility
    he's correct on his big point.

  zh: 如果你曾经看过诺姆·乔姆斯基（Noam Chomsky）的演讲，你会注意到他的讨论涉及政治学、经济学、社会学、历史学，并在每个领域提到了几个不同的事实。说服力的关键似乎是要有一个不可辩驳的论点，因为没有事实是必要的，而且它们是如此分散，以至于没有人能够明确地反驳其中的大部分。也就是说，表面上拥有大量事实是令人不堪重负的。因此，通过成千上万的支持性事实来推广大问题（例如，无政府工团主义？资本主义是邪恶的？）。你没有足够的时间，也没有人有足够的广度来评估其中的所有事实，仅仅反驳一个有限的子集就留下了逻辑上的可能性，即他在大问题上是正确的。

    really statements about relations between datapoints. As there are an infinite
    number of relational facts, you can’t expect to know them all even if you know
    all the basic data points, so certainly you can't easily rebut them all. So everyone
    knows only a different subset of the relations, which gives them different ‘facts’.
    There's no simple way to reconcile them, because there are so man facts, each
    supportive in their own way.

  zh: 这在2005年12月的《美国经济评论》（AER）中很好地解释了。其核心思想是，大多数“事实”实际上是关于数据点之间关系的陈述。由于关系事实有无穷多个，即使你知道所有基本数据点，也不能指望全部知道它们，因此你当然不能轻易地反驳它们。因此，每个人只知道不同的关系子集，这给他们带来了不同的“事实”。没有简单的方法来协调它们，因为有太多的事实，每个都以自己的方式支持。
- en: Any expert merely knows a lot of facts relevant to his prejudices, and it's
    not hard to make a case for anything, which is why a good lawyer always helps.
    It also explains why people don't converge on the truth, because once you are
    a valued advocate for X, the payoffs from others who like X are surely better
    than recognizing that X is, in fact, false (plus, presumably after so many years
    most of your friends and colleagues are X-lovers).

  zh: 任何专家只是了解与他的偏见相关的大量事实，要为任何事情提出理由并不难，这就是为什么一个好的律师总是有所帮助的原因。这也解释了为什么人们不会收敛于真理，因为一旦你成为了X的受欢迎的倡导者，那么喜欢X的其他人给你的回报肯定比承认X实际上是假的要好（而且，大概在这么多年之后，你的大部分朋友和同事都是X的爱好者）。
