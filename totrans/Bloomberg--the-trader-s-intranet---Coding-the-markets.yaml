    how precious screen real estate is on the trading floor. One of the things traders
    alway have running is their [Bloomberg](http://www.bloomberg.com) terminal. Unlike
    us coders, they won’t have web, email and chat clients consuming that precious
    screen space. Bloomberg does email and chat anyway. Consequently, when a trader
    wants to publish some stuff to their colleagues on the floor, they’ll want to
    publish it on Bloomberg. That stuff may be some indicative quotes or valuations.

    their publication requirements with an [XLL](https://etrading.wordpress.com/excel/)
    that can send an Excel worksheet to a Bloomberg GPGX page. That’s a GPGX, not
    a GDCO, which is for executable quotes. One click of a button and the trader’s
    free formatted sheet is out there on Bloomberg. Result: happy trader.'
