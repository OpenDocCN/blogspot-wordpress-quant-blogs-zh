    effect](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Holiday%20Effect),” which
    is the tendency of the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) December futures to trade at
    a discount to the midpoint of the VIX November and January futures.

- en: Part of the explanation for the holiday effect is embedded in the historical
    record. For instance, in eight of the last twenty years, the VIX index has made
    its annual low during the month of December. In fact, the VIX has demonstrated
    a marked tendency to decline steadily for the first 17 trading days of the month,
    as shown below in Figure 1, which uses normalized VIX December data to compare
    all VIX values for each trading day dating back to 1990\. Not surprisingly, those
    17 trading days neatly coincide with the typical number of December trading days
    in advance of the Christmas holiday.

    occurs from the middle of the month right up to the Christmas holiday.

- en: Most VIX traders are aware of the tendency of implied volatility in general
    and the VIX in particular to decline in December. As a result, since the launch
    of VIX futures in 2004, there has usually been a noticeable dip in the [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures)
    [term structure](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/term%20structure)
    curve for the month of December. Figure 2 below is a snapshot of the VIX futures
    curve from September 12, 2012\. Here I have added a dotted black line to show
    what a linear interpolation of the December VIX futures would look like, with
    the green line showing the 0.50 point differential between the actual December
    VIX futures settlement value of 20.40 on that date and the 20.90 interpolated
    value, which is derived from the November and January VIX futures contracts. (Apart
    from the distortions present in the December VIX futures, a linear interpolation
    utilizing the first and third month VIX futures normally provides an excellent
    estimate of the value of the second month VIX futures.)

- en: Looking at the full record of historical data, the mean holiday effect for all
    days in which the November, December and January futures traded is 1.87%, which
    means that the December VIX futures have been, on average, 1.87% lower than the
    value predicted by a linear interpolation of the November and January VIX futures.
    Further analysis reveals that on 91% of all trading days, the December VIX futures
    are lower than their November-January interpolated value. The holiday effect,
    therefore, is persistent and substantial.

    daunting task, as there are only six holiday seasons from which one can derive
    meaningful VIX futures data. Figure 3 shows the monthly average VIX December futures
    (solid blue line) as well as the midpoint of the November and the January VIX
    futures (dotted red line) for each month since the VIX futures consecutive contracts
    were launched in October 2006\. Here the green bars represent the magnitude of
    the holiday effect expressed in percentage terms, with the sign inverted (i.e.,
    a +2% holiday effect means that the VIX December futures would be 2% *below* the
    interpolated value derived from November and January futures.)

- en: With limited data from which to draw conclusions, it is tempting to eyeball
    the data and look for emerging patterns which may repeat in the future. Clearly
    one pattern is that an elevated or rising VIX appears to coincide with a larger
    magnitude holiday effect, whereas a depressed or falling VIX is consistent with
    a smaller holiday effect. The data is much less compelling when one tries to determine
    whether the time remaining until the holiday season has an influence on the magnitude
    of the holiday effect. While one might expect the holiday effect to become magnified
    later in the season, the evidence to support this hypothesis is scant at this
    stage.

    December and the downward blip in December for the VIX futures term structure
    reflects this thinking. As far as whether this [seasonal anomaly](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/seasonality)
    is tradable, there is still a limited amount of data – not to mention some highly
    unusual volatility years – from which to develop and back test a robust VIX futures
    strategy designed to capture the holiday effect.

    holiday season is also complicated by matters such as the fiscal cliff deadline
    and various euro zone milestones that are set for early 2013\. In fact, there
    may not be a reasonable equivalent since the Y2K fears in late 1999 that turned
    out to be a volatility non-event when the calendar flipped to 2000.

- en: While the opportunities to capitalize on the 2012 holiday effect may be difficult
    to pinpoint and fleeting, all investors should be attuned to seasonal volatility
    cycles as 2013 unfolds and volatility expectations ebb and flow with the news
    cycle as well as the calendar.
