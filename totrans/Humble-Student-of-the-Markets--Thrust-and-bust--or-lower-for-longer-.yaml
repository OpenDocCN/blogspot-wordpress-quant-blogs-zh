    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    signal. A bullish Trend Model signal that gets less bullish is a trading "sell"
    signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading
    "buy" signal. The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of
    the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. Past trading of
    the trading model has shown turnover rates of about 200% per month.

    then followed by a Fed induced bust. However, the combination of softer macro-economic

    the probability of the "thrust and bust" scenario. In particular, the decline
    in inflationary expectations has been global in scope, though the US (red line)

    theme. Not only did headline employment miss expectations, employment for previous
    months was revised downwards. Even though a June rate hike is more or less baked
    in, the big question is whether the Fed is likely to pause its rate normalization
    policy in light of disappointing inflation and growth statistics.
