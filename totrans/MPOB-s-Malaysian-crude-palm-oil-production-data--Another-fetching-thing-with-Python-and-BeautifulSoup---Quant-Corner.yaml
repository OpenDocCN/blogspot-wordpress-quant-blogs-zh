- en: We needed up-to-date Malaysian crude palm oil production data. The MPOB provides
    such data on its website. It remained to write some ugly but somewhat reliable snippet
    code in **Python**, the latter doing a lot with only few lines of codes. We used the
    additional library **BeautifulSoup** we already used [here](https://quantcorner.wordpress.com/2014/03/05/scraping-data-from-the-internet-with-python-and-beautifulsoup/
    "Parsing pdf files with Python and PDFMiner") and [here](https://quantcorner.wordpress.com/2014/03/05/scraping-data-from-the-internet-with-python-and-beautifulsoup/
    "Scraping data from the internet with Python and BeautifulSoup").

    the original piece of code to get them from the MPOB’s website.

    Excel** (kindda *.csv format).
