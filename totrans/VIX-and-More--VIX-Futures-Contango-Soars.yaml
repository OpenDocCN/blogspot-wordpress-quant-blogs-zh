- en: Last week I started publishing something I call the [VIX Futures Contango Index](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20Futures%20Contango%20Index)
    in my [subscriber newsletter](http://vixandmoresubscriber.blogspot.com/). The
    intent of this index is to enhance one’s sense of the shape of the of [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures)
    [term structure](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/term%20structure)
    curve, by building on the simple math of the front month and second month [roll
    yield](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/roll%20yield) calculations
    to come up with a mathematical representation of the degree of [contango](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/contango)
    or [backwardation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backwardation) across the entire
    VIX futures term structure.

    at 99.8, which is the third most extreme contango reading since VIX futures were
    launched in March 2004\. *[The index values range from 0-100, with 0 being extreme
    backwardation and 100 being extreme contango.]*

- en: Extreme contango readings are generally associated with turning points in stocks,
    which is why in the chart below, I have highlighted the two most extreme VIX futures
    contango readings. The highest VIX futures contango reading in the history of
    the VIX futures comes from April 21, 2010 and is indicated by the red arrow in
    the chart below. Note that this mark was achieved just two days before the SPX
    posted its closing high for 2010.

    July 21, 2010, just over one month ago. This extreme contango situation is flagged
    with a green arrow on the chart below, as it turns out stocks were about to move
    up to their highest close (SPX 1127) since the May selloff.

    time around. Clearly the market thinks another selloff is in the cards that will
    drive the VIX up over 30 by the beginning of 2011\. I have a less pessimistic
    outlook, but will be watching the VIX term structure closely to see if the level
    of contango is able to rise above the April high water mark.
