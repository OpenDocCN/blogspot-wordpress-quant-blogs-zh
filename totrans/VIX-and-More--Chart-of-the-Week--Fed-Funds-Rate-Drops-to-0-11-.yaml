- en: Thanks to the Federal Reserve’s decision to drop their target Fed Funds rate
    to an all-time record of 0.00% to 0.25%, the subject of this week’s [chart of

- en: The Fed has 55 years of Fed Funds rate data and I have chosen to highlight not
    the target rate announced by the FOMC, but the daily effective federal funds rate,
    which is a volume-weighted average of rates on trades arranged by major brokers.

    but that record was actually established on December 10^(th) and tied again on
    Friday.

    average Fed Funds rate since 1954 is 5.62%.
