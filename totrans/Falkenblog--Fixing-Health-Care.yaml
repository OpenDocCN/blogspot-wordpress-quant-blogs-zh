    without penalize those with higher expected medical expenses is amusing because
    it's redistribution masquerading as some simple engineering problem. It's always
    more efficient in these scenarios to simply redistribute, rather than play games
    so no one sees this as what is really going on, but then this is a harder sell
    and thus the equilibrium. I was struck by this line in David Henderson's

    face real prices for health care comes from the area of cosmetic surgery. Such
    surgery, he notes, is rarely covered by insurance. He points out that, uunlike
    in most areas covered by insurance, patients can typically find a package price
    that includes all services and facilities and compare prices prior to surgery.
    Moreover, he notes, prices adjusted for inflation have fallen over time as technology
    has improved. He notes that for the kinds of surgery covered by insurance, improvements
    in technology are blamed for rising prices.

    worse, which is where I see us going. Less regulation seems improbable regardless
    of who wins the election.
