- en: I was an official economist for a while, back at KeyCorp, and would sometimes
    have to give little presentations on the standard macro variables. I remember
    once in early 1995 having a little 5 minute presentation to the board of a large
    hardware supply company (a small 'Home Depot' type chain). About 20 suits in a
    room, and they were all very interested in where interest rates were going. At
    that time, rates had rise a lot, the yield curve was steep, and they were very
    concerned. Now, given they had a lot of fixed rate long term debt, they could
    lose a lot of money if rates fell (rates fall, bond prices rise, and they were
    short bonds). If rates fell, their liabilities would go the other way. As rates
    were moving a lot, they were very concerned.

    They did, but that's not the point. Indeed, I should have told them I have no
    clue, but I knew they wanted a 'view', and I was trying to be helpful (we were
    a 'full service' bank). They debated back and forth for 20 minutes, and though
    I left, I had the sense they kept discussing it. I never found out what they actually
    did. The point is a large amount of management time was spent discussing something
    where they had no alpha, no comparative advantage, no value as management. They
    all assumed markets were 'wrong', so the question to them was clearly which way.
    If instead they thought bond prices incorporated all available information, they
    would have chosen a neutral position, say by having floating rate debt (it was
    feasible to swap into this).

    if markets are rational. They then basically take random gambles that on average
    lose money via fees paid on various transactions. Most importantly, they lose
    their focus on where they conceivably have alpha.
