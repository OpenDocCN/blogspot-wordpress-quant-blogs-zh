- en: I was an official economist for a while, back at KeyCorp, and would sometimes
    have to give little presentations on the standard macro variables. I remember
    once in early 1995 having a little 5 minute presentation to the board of a large
    hardware supply company (a small 'Home Depot' type chain). About 20 suits in a
    room, and they were all very interested in where interest rates were going. At
    that time, rates had rise a lot, the yield curve was steep, and they were very
    concerned. Now, given they had a lot of fixed rate long term debt, they could
    lose a lot of money if rates fell (rates fall, bond prices rise, and they were
    short bonds). If rates fell, their liabilities would go the other way. As rates
    were moving a lot, they were very concerned.

  zh: 我曾是一段时间内钥匙银行的官方经济学家，有时会在标准宏观变量上进行小型演示。记得1995年初时我曾在一个大型硬件供应公司（一个小型的‘家得宝’类型的连锁店）的董事会上做了一个5分钟的演示。屋子里有20多个西装，他们都对利率的走势非常感兴趣。那时，利率上升了很多，收益曲线很陡，他们非常担心。现在，考虑到他们有大量固定利率的长期债务，如果利率下跌，他们可能会损失很多钱（利率下降，债券价格上升，而他们是做空债券的）。如果利率下跌，他们的负债情况将会恰好相反。由于利率的波动很大，他们非常担心。
- en: I told them in general, when the yield curve is really flat, rates tend to fall.
    They did, but that's not the point. Indeed, I should have told them I have no
    clue, but I knew they wanted a 'view', and I was trying to be helpful (we were
    a 'full service' bank). They debated back and forth for 20 minutes, and though
    I left, I had the sense they kept discussing it. I never found out what they actually
    did. The point is a large amount of management time was spent discussing something
    where they had no alpha, no comparative advantage, no value as management. They
    all assumed markets were 'wrong', so the question to them was clearly which way.
    If instead they thought bond prices incorporated all available information, they
    would have chosen a neutral position, say by having floating rate debt (it was
    feasible to swap into this).

  zh: 我一般告诉他们，一般来说，当收益曲线非常平缓时，利率往往会下降。他们是这样做的，但这不是重点。事实上，我本应该告诉他们我毫无头绪，但我知道他们想要一个‘观点’，而且我尽力想要帮助（我们是一家‘全方位’的银行）。他们辩论了20分钟，虽然我离开了，但我觉得他们一直在讨论。我从未弄清他们实际上做了什么。重点是，他们在讨论一个他们没有优势、没有比较优势、没有管理价值的事情上浪费了大量的管理时间。他们都认为市场是‘错误’的，所以对他们来说问题显然是朝哪个方向去。如果他们认为债券价格包含了所有能获得的信息，他们会选择中立的立场，比如持有浮动利率债务（这是可以转换成浮动利率债务的）。
- en: A lot of resources are wasted by people who think it is imprudent to act as
    if markets are rational. They then basically take random gambles that on average
    lose money via fees paid on various transactions. Most importantly, they lose
    their focus on where they conceivably have alpha.

  zh: 很多资源都被那些认为市场是理性的人浪费了，他们认为做出看待市场是理性的举动是不谨慎的。他们基本上是随机赌博，平均来说通过各种交易支付的费用赔钱。最重要的是，他们失去了在可能有优势的地方的关注。
