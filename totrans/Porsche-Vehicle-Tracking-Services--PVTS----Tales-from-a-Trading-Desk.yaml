    cars, Porsche offers a vehicle tracking service – PVTS.  What surprised me was
    the device the driver had to carry with him as part of this service – a small
    black driver [card](http://www.porscheownersmanuals.com/2014-panamera/8/249/Porsche-Vehicle-Tracking-System-PVTS).
     The obvious problem with the driver card is that you can’t attach it to the car
    keys, as it nows tired to the keys the theft might have stolen, and thus the service
    is redundant.  If you carry the card in your pocket, its likely to get lost, or
    you will forget to carry it and get a call from the tracking centre telling you
    your car was stolen when it isn’t.  I wonder how long it will be before Porsche
    consider the option of adding an app to your smart phone, and using bluetooth to
    heart beat to the car – since the driver card at best must effectively be a authorisation
    heart beat.  Doing away with the driver car is further amplified by taking a look
    at the Porsche Car [Connect](http://www.porsche.com/uk/connect/carconnect/) app
    already available – the driver card isn’t even pictures or mentioned, and does
    look lame in comparison.
