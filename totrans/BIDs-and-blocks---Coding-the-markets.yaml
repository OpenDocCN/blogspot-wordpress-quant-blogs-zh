    on [Bids](http://www.finextra.com/fullstory.asp?id=15928) – a new block trading
    system. Since the system is completely anonymised, I can’t see how it solves the
    information asymmetry problem for the trader offering block liquidity. How can
    he be sure that the liquidity taker isn’t better informed, and about to leave
    him with a massive position against which the market then moves ?
