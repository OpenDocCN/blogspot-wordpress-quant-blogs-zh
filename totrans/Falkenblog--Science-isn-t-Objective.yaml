    Those who claim their side is scientific, are basically saying the other side
    is prejudiced and ignorant. It could be true, but both parties in the US have
    significant anti-(ideal) science wings.

    by Fruedian analysis, an embarrassment (penis envy, Oedipus complex). Think about
    the fact that most economists thought socialism was more productive than capitalism
    until the the latter half of the twentieth century, or that large-scale macro
    models could predict business cycles. Lots of smart, well-intentioned people spent
    their lives studying and lecturing false ideas, all under the guise of 'science'.

    the politically correct banality of Norwegian sociologists. The videos are

- en: In Norway, the social sciences have been more dominated by ideology and fear
    of biology than in perhaps any other country. This has a long history starting
    in the 60s. Social science became very much bound up with the ideology of the
    Social Democrats, who put pride in the fact that Norway was the most egalitarian
    country in the world....

    most research is sponsored by one source, the Norwegian Research Council, which
    has strong links with the government...

    Norwegian social science, and gender science in particular, is built on very shaky
    ground. Most studies have been done without even considering factors like heredity:
    The reason why some people turned criminals, or did badly in school, was always
    explained by social and cultural factors. To even mention heredity as a possible
    factor, was met with condescending laughter or irritation...'
