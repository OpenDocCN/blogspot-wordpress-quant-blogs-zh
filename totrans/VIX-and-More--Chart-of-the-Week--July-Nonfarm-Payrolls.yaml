    be the [nonfarm payrolls](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/nonfarm%20payrolls)
    and this week was no exception.

    private payroll data, hours worked and average hourly earnings indicate that there
    are continued signs of improvement, small though they may be.

- en: It is worth observing that even without the fluctuations caused by the census
    employment situation, it is not unusual for the net payroll changes to see a significant
    degree of monthly noise in the short term and/or exhibit some pattern of starts
    and stops over the longer term as the economy lurches forward into a more coherent
    recovery mode.

- en: Finally, it is important to note that in order for the employment situation
    to cease being a drag on the economy, merely breaking even on payrolls from month
    to month is not enough. Most estimates indicate that 100,000 – 125,000 new jobs
    need to be created each month just to accommodate the demographics of a growing
    labor force.
