    the past two months or so: 50 day [historical volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/historical%20volatility)
    (HV) in the S&P 500 index dropped. While that fact in itself might not be worth
    of a headline next to the latest installment of ‘Adventures in TARPland,’ there
    is a strong possibility that historical volatility in the SPX has just peaked.'

    on October 22^(nd), followed by the 20 and 30 day HV topping out on November 5^(th)
    and November 7^(th). It is too early to say definitively that 50 day historical
    volatility will not exceed Friday’s high, but the odds are in favor of it, as
    it is only a couple more days before the Lehman-powered selloff of September 15^(th)
    scrolls off of the 50 day lookback window.

- en: Now I’m sure this bit of volatility trivia is not likely to excite readers,
    so I have included a chart below which shows the last three times 50 day historical
    volatility in the SPX has peaked at a level of 30 or higher. While all three previous
    instances (marked by the blue arrows) have turned out to be excellent buying opportunities,
    finding historical parallels to help interpret the current market situation has
    lately been an approach fraught with danger.

- en: A better way to think about historical volatility rolling over is that like
    the VIX, historical volatility is a barometer of some of the uncertainty and emotional
    components of the markets. As these readings begin to pull back from recent highs,
    investors of all persuasions are more likely to enter the markets.
