# “As a developer…” | Tales from a Trading Desk

## “As a developer…”

For me, the backlog is critical to a successful project.  A poor backlog provides often a view that the wrong functionality is being built due to lack of product owner engagement, or lack of team understanding what the product owner wants.  I view a backlog in a similar way to a suit.  Wearing a good quality suit offer a view of your character.  A poorly constructed backlog shows lack of engagement by the team.  Here are a few links to hopefully improve backlog quality:
