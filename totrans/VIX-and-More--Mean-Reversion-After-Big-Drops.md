# VIX and More: Mean Reversion After Big Drops

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/02/mean-reversion-after-big-drops.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/02/mean-reversion-after-big-drops.html#0001-01-01)

Eddy Elfenbein at [Crossing Wall Street](http://www.crossingwallstreet.com/) has a nice little graphic and commentary up today: [How the Market Behaves on Big Down Days.](http://www.crossingwallstreet.com/archives/2008/02/how_the_market.html)

After researching the 37 instances in which the S&P 500 index dropped 3.2% or more (as it did yesterday), Elfenbein draws the following conclusions:

*“The average loss for the sell-off is 5.01%. After that, nearly every day is an up day. By the ninth day, the S&P 500 is down 3.48%, which is indeed, a retracement of about one-third.  The market still trends higher to the 17th day where it's down just 3.01%, or about a 40% retracement. At that point, the linger effects of the sell-off seem to dissolve.”*

Elfenbein’s findings should come as no surprise to those who pay attention to the TRIN and ISEE, as well as the VIX, various market breadth indicators, etc.  While volatility has been on the tame side lately, the [TRIN](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TRIN), [ISEE](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/ISEE), and [McClellan Summation Index](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/McClellan%20Summation%20Index) have all been suggesting a strong oversold situation and a high probability [mean reversion](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/mean%20reversion) bullish entry.

The duration of the retracement pattern identified by Elfenbein is also worth noting, as it hearkens back to some work on [VIX spike](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20spikes) retracements I published last April in [Lessons from the Post-2/27 VIX Price Action](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/04/lessons-from-post-227-vix-price-action.html), where the optimal retracement window was determined to be about eight days.
