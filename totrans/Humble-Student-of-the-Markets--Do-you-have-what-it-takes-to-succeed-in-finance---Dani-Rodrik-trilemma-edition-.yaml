    In the late 1990s he pointed out that deeper economic integration required harmonisation
    of laws and regulations across countries. Differences in rules on employment contracts
    or product-safety requirements, for instance, act as barriers to trade. Indeed,
    trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership focus more on “non-tariff
    barriers” than they do on tariff reduction. But the consequences often run counter
    to popular preferences: the French might find themselves barred from supporting
    a French-language film industry, for example.'

    of democracy, as national leaders disregard the will of the public, or will cause
    the dissolution of the nation state, as authority moves to supranational bodies
    elected to create harmonised rules for everyone to follow. These trade-offs create
    a “trilemma”, in Mr Rodrik’s view: societies cannot be globally integrated, completely
    sovereign and democratic—they can opt for only two of the three. In the late 1990s
    Mr Rodrik speculated that the sovereignty of nation states would be the item societies
    chose to discard. Yet it now seems that economic integration may be more vulnerable.'

    of standards and business practices. While that sounds fine in theory, here is
    an example of what happens when the rubber meets the road.
