- en: One analogy that is often used in foreign policy journals in the West's dealings
    with Russia, formerly the Soviet Union, is that while one side thinks it's playing
    chess, the other is playing poker. The implication is that we, the West, are playing
    the wrong game. An alternative interpretation is that both sides can get what
    they want, it's just up to each side to understand the trade-offs of its own strategy.

    longer respect Europeans the way they once did after the Cold War. Russia thinks
    the West is no longer a crusading alliance. Russia thinks the West is now all
    about the money.

    for years. They have mansions and luxury flats from London’s West End to France’s
    Cote d’Azure. Their children are safe at British boarding and Swiss finishing
    schools. And their money is squirrelled away in Austrian banks and British tax
    havens.

    them all in MI6\. Now they know better. They have seen firsthand how obsequious
    Western aristocrats and corporate tycoons suddenly turn when their billions come
    into play. They now view them as hypocrites—the same European elites who help
    them hide their fortunes.

    the baroque corruption of Russian state companies. But no more. Because they know

- en: Strictly from a coldly logical position (and I am not advocating this, I should
    add), in many ways it is in Kyiv’s interests for Moscow to steal Crimea, and turn
    it into some pseudo-state or new part of the Russian Federation. Ukraine loses
    a sunny peninsula, but also a distinct drain on the state’s coffers (the Crimean
    economy is not great, and the region receives net subsidies from the centre).
    It sheds the most troublesome and Russophile of its regions, one which has been
    a turbulent locus of trouble for Kyiv for most of post-Soviet Ukraine’s history.
    It also gets concrete proof of the threat it faces from Russian bullying and probably
    accelerated and solicitous assistance from the US, EU, NATO, etc. It also validates
    every Ukrainian fear about Russia.

    Putin wants the Crimea, why not let him have it? In the corporate world, this
    would be called "restructuring", "shedding underperforming assets", or "right-sizing".
    In other words, rather than allow a bunch of federal bureaucrats in Washington
    figure how to deal with Putin, why not let the market do it for us?
