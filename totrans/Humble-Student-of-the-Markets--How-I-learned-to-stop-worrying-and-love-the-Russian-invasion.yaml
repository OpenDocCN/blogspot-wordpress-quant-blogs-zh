    with Russia, formerly the Soviet Union, is that while one side thinks it's playing
    chess, the other is playing poker. The implication is that we, the West, are playing
    the wrong game. An alternative interpretation is that both sides can get what
    they want, it's just up to each side to understand the trade-offs of its own strategy.

- en: Strictly from a coldly logical position (and I am not advocating this, I should
    add), in many ways it is in Kyiv’s interests for Moscow to steal Crimea, and turn
    it into some pseudo-state or new part of the Russian Federation. Ukraine loses
    a sunny peninsula, but also a distinct drain on the state’s coffers (the Crimean
    economy is not great, and the region receives net subsidies from the centre).
    It sheds the most troublesome and Russophile of its regions, one which has been
    a turbulent locus of trouble for Kyiv for most of post-Soviet Ukraine’s history.
    It also gets concrete proof of the threat it faces from Russian bullying and probably
    accelerated and solicitous assistance from the US, EU, NATO, etc. It also validates
    every Ukrainian fear about Russia.

  zh: 从纯粹的逻辑角度来看（我应该补充说我不是提倡这一点），在许多方面，对于基辅来说，莫斯科窃取克里米亚，并将其变成某种伪国家或俄罗斯联邦的新部分是有利的。乌克兰失去了一个阳光明媚的半岛，但也摆脱了国家财政的沉重负担（克里米亚经济并不出色，该地区从中心获得净补贴）。它摆脱了最麻烦和亲俄的地区，这个地区在苏联解体后的乌克兰大部分历史中都是基辅的动荡焦点。它还得到了俄罗斯欺凌的威胁的具体证据，以及可能来自美国、欧盟、北约等的加速和热心的帮助。这也验证了乌克兰对俄罗斯的每一项担忧。
- en: The post is well reading in its entirety but Galeotti makes a good point. If
    Putin wants the Crimea, why not let him have it? In the corporate world, this
    would be called "restructuring", "shedding underperforming assets", or "right-sizing".
    In other words, rather than allow a bunch of federal bureaucrats in Washington
    figure how to deal with Putin, why not let the market do it for us?

  zh: 这篇文章值得一读，但 Galeotti 提出了一个很好的观点。如果普京想要克里米亚，为什么不让他拥有呢？在企业界，这被称为"重组"、"剥离表现不佳的资产"或"合理规模"。换句话说，与其让华盛顿的一群联邦官僚去想办法对付普京，不如让市场为我们解决这个问题？
