    Salient Capital Advisors: [http://www.theriskparityindex.com/static/pdfs/Salient-Risk-Parity-Index-White-Paper.pdf](http://www.theriskparityindex.com/static/pdfs/Salient-Risk-Parity-Index-White-Paper.pdf). 
    The visual is useful for readers to understand the nuances and relative merits
    of a [Cluster Risk Parity](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2013/01/03/cluster-risk-parity/
    "Cluster Risk Parity") (CRP) approach. In their approach ***the individual assets
    and clusters are defined in advance***, and thus there is ***no dynamic clustering
    method used***. However, the concept that they use is similar: balance risk contributions
    both within and across “clusters” of assets.  In this case it is important to
    clarify that the size/area of each slice of the pie chart is a function of risk
    contributions NOT percentage capital allocations.'

    to the [“All-Weather” Portfolio](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2012/11/07/the-all-weather-portfolio-derivation/
    "The “All-Weather” Portfolio Derivation") or even the simpler [Permanent Portfolio](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2012/11/01/permanent-portfolio-derivation-and-historical-performance/
    "Permanent Portfolio Derivation and Historical Performance") . The main difference
    is that the latter portfolio schemes represent “strategic asset allocation” alternatives,
    while [Cluster Risk Parity](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2013/01/03/cluster-risk-parity/
    "Cluster Risk Parity")  (and also the Salient Index) is a dynamic asset allocation
    framework. GestaltU does a good job describing why it is important to prefer dynamic
    approaches in a recent post: [http://gestaltu.blogspot.com/2013/01/the-full-montier-absolute-vs-relative.html](http://gestaltu.blogspot.com/2013/01/the-full-montier-absolute-vs-relative.html).
    In reference to CRP the advantage is creating a framework that does not require
    having to pre-specify the assets and weights in advance on a static basis. Instead,
    it permits the ability for the portfolio to adapt to changes in the variance/covariance
    matrix of asset returns — which have proven especially useful in a dynamic framework
    to normalize risk exposure. This framework is so generic that it can be adapted
    to any type of risk factor or regime framework with relative ease.'
