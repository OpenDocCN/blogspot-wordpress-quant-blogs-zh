    market to see where the strength is coming from and to understand the message
    of the market. Instead of the usual analysis of technical leadership from a sectors
    or market cap perspective, I thought that I would do something slightly different
    and look at the global picture of international stock leadership.

    the near-term path for equities will be choppy and volatile. The charts are showing
    continued leadership by US equities and the US Dollar. All other global regions
    are underperforming. Under these circumstances, I would stay with the strength
    and concentrate the bulk of any equity exposure in the US and overweight USD assets
    in a global portfolio.

    began last summer. Currently, it appears to be testing the bottom trendline of
    the uptrend, but I would give the USD bulls the benefit of the doubt for now.
