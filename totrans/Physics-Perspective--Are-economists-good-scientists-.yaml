    to work on a book closely related to this blog. The deadline is getting closer.
    I hope to resume something like my previous posting frequency soon.

    opinions about the scientific method (that seems the best term for it, at least).
    Ole Rogeberg, a reader of this blog, alerted me to

    they looked to actual empirical tests of a theory's predictions in judging the
    value of a theory. The answer, it turns out, is -- not much. Internal consistency
    seems to be more important than empirical test.

    explain heroin addiction and other life destroying addictions as the consequence
    of fully rational choices on the part of individuals as they maximize their expected
    utility over their lifetimes -- which on the face of it seems highly unlikely,
    making the burden of empirical evidence (one would think) even higher. Some history.
    Gary Becker (Nobel Prize) of the University of Chicago is famous for his efforts
    to push the neo-classical framework into every last corner of human life. He (and
    many followers) have applied the trusted old recipe of utility maximization to
    understand (they claim) everything from crime to patterns of having children to
    addiction. You may see a slobbering shivering drunk or junkie in an alleyway in
    winter and think -- like most people -- there goes someone trapped in some very
    destructive behavioural feedback controlled by the interaction of addictive physical
    substances, emotions and so on. Not Becker. It's all quite rational, he argues.

- en: This paper reports on results from a survey of views on the theory of rational
    addiction among academics who have contributed to this research. The topic is
    important because if the literature is viewed by its participants as an intellectual
    game, then policy makers should be aware of this so as not to derive actual policy
    from misleading models. A majority of the respondents believe the literature is
    a success story that demonstrates the power of economic reasoning. At the same
    time, they also believe the empirical evidence to be weak, and they disagree both
    on the type of evidence that would validate the theory and the policy implications.
    These results shed light on how many economists think about model building, evidence
    requirements and the policy relevance of their work.

    counts as important. I've certainly learned this from following 20 years of research
    on high temperature superconductivity, where every new paper with "knock down"
    evidence for some claim tends to be immediately countered by someone else claiming
    this evidence actually shows something quite different. The materials are complex
    as is the physics, and so far it just doesn't seem possible to bring clarity to
    the subject.

    They readily admit that they have no good theory. The same attitude doesn't seem
    to have been common in economics. Rogeberg and Melberg have also described their
    survey work in

- en: The core of the causal insight claims from rational addiction research is that
    people behave in a certain way (i.e. exhibit addictive behavior) because they
    face and solve a specific type of choice problem. Yet rational addiction researchers
    show no interest in empirically examining the actual choice problem – the preferences,
    beliefs, and choice processes – of the people whose behavior they claim to be
    explaining. Becker has even suggested that the rational choice process occurs
    at some subconscious level that the acting subject is unaware of, making human
    introspection irrelevant and leaving us no known way to gather relevant data...

    people neither face nor would be able to solve prescribes an optimal consumption
    plan no one is aware of having. The gradual implementation of this unknown plan
    is then claimed to be the actual explanation for why people over time smoke more
    than they should according to the plans they actually thought they had. To quote
    Bertrand Russell out of context, this ‘is one of those views which are so absurd
    that only very learned men could possibly adopt them’ (Russell 1995, p. 110).
