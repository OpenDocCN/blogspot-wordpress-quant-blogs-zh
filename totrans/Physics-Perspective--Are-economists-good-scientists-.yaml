- en: This even for a theory -- the theory of "rational addiction", which seeks to
    explain heroin addiction and other life destroying addictions as the consequence
    of fully rational choices on the part of individuals as they maximize their expected
    utility over their lifetimes -- which on the face of it seems highly unlikely,
    making the burden of empirical evidence (one would think) even higher. Some history.
    Gary Becker (Nobel Prize) of the University of Chicago is famous for his efforts
    to push the neo-classical framework into every last corner of human life. He (and
    many followers) have applied the trusted old recipe of utility maximization to
    understand (they claim) everything from crime to patterns of having children to
    addiction. You may see a slobbering shivering drunk or junkie in an alleyway in
    winter and think -- like most people -- there goes someone trapped in some very
    destructive behavioural feedback controlled by the interaction of addictive physical
    substances, emotions and so on. Not Becker. It's all quite rational, he argues.

  zh: 即使是对于一个理论——解释海洛因成瘾和其他破坏性成瘾作为个体在最大化他们终身预期效用过程中完全理性选择的后果的“理性成瘾”理论——从表面上看这是非常不可能的，这使得经验证据的负担（人们认为）更高。一些历史背景。芝加哥大学的加里·贝克尔（诺贝尔奖得主）以将新古典框架推进到人类生活的每一个角落而闻名。他和许多追随者将效用最大化的古老配方应用于理解（他们声称）从犯罪到生育模式，再到成瘾的一切。你可能在冬天的巷子里看到一个口水横流、颤抖的醉汉或瘾君子，并认为——像大多数人一样——那里的人陷入了某些由成瘾性物质、情感等相互作用控制的非常具有破坏性的行为反馈中。贝克尔不这么认为。他认为这都是相当理性的。

  zh: 现在，Rogeberg和Melberg。以下是他们的摘要：
- en: This paper reports on results from a survey of views on the theory of rational
    addiction among academics who have contributed to this research. The topic is
    important because if the literature is viewed by its participants as an intellectual
    game, then policy makers should be aware of this so as not to derive actual policy
    from misleading models. A majority of the respondents believe the literature is
    a success story that demonstrates the power of economic reasoning. At the same
    time, they also believe the empirical evidence to be weak, and they disagree both
    on the type of evidence that would validate the theory and the policy implications.
    These results shed light on how many economists think about model building, evidence
    requirements and the policy relevance of their work.

  zh: 这篇论文报告了一项关于对理性成瘾理论贡献的学者们的调查结果。这个话题很重要，因为如果参与者认为文献是一个智力的游戏，那么政策制定者应该意识到这一点，不要从具有误导性的模型中得出实际政策。大多数受访者认为，文献是一个成功的故事，展示了经济推理的力量。与此同时，他们也认为实证证据是薄弱的，他们在证实理论的证据类型以及政策含义上意见不一致。这些结果揭示了众多经济学家是如何思考模型构建、证据要求以及他们工作的政策相关性的。
- en: Now, in any area of science there are disgreements over what evidence really
    counts as important. I've certainly learned this from following 20 years of research
    on high temperature superconductivity, where every new paper with "knock down"
    evidence for some claim tends to be immediately countered by someone else claiming
    this evidence actually shows something quite different. The materials are complex
    as is the physics, and so far it just doesn't seem possible to bring clarity to
    the subject.

- en: The core of the causal insight claims from rational addiction research is that
    people behave in a certain way (i.e. exhibit addictive behavior) because they
    face and solve a specific type of choice problem. Yet rational addiction researchers
    show no interest in empirically examining the actual choice problem – the preferences,
    beliefs, and choice processes – of the people whose behavior they claim to be
    explaining. Becker has even suggested that the rational choice process occurs
    at some subconscious level that the acting subject is unaware of, making human
    introspection irrelevant and leaving us no known way to gather relevant data...

  zh: 理性成瘾研究的因果洞察核心是，人们以某种方式行为（即表现出成瘾行为），是因为他们面临并解决了一种特定类型的选择问题。然而，理性成瘾研究者对实证考察实际的选择问题——人们的偏好、信仰和选择过程——毫无兴趣，这些问题是他们声称要解释的行为。贝克尔甚至建议，理性选择过程发生在某些无意识的层面上，行动主体并不知情，使人类内省变得无关紧要，并留给我们没有已知方式来收集相关数据...

    people neither face nor would be able to solve prescribes an optimal consumption
    plan no one is aware of having. The gradual implementation of this unknown plan
    is then claimed to be the actual explanation for why people over time smoke more
    than they should according to the plans they actually thought they had. To quote
    Bertrand Russell out of context, this ‘is one of those views which are so absurd
    that only very learned men could possibly adopt them’ (Russell 1995, p. 110).
