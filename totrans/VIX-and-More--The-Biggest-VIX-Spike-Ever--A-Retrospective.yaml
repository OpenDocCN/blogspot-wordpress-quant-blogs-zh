    record VIX spike back in 2007 – and with it a 3.5% decline in the S&P 500 index.
    Most media reports at the time focused on a drop in Chinese stocks. In fact, as
    I [noted later](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/02/volatility-storm-at-two-years-and.html),
    concerns about the Chinese government raising interest rates to discourage speculation
    helped to trigger an 8.8% loss in the Shanghai Composite Index and a 9.9% loss
    in the FTSE/Xinhua China 25 index that is the basis for the popular Chinese ETF,
    [FXI](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/FXI). Various other news reports
    pointed to concerning U.S. economic data and there were some who were apparently
    spooked by a Taliban suicide bombing attack in Afghanistan that targeted Vice
    President Dick Cheney.

    almost nowhere to be found at the time.

    one month before the VIX spike and in a world where a sub-10 VIX was common, I
    added the tongue-in-cheek tagline to the blog: “Your One-Stop VIX-Centric View
    of the Universe…” Twitter was in its infancy, CNBC hadn’t even thought about the
    idea of running a VIX ticker across your TV screen and most people didn’t even
    know what the VIX was at that time.'

    a big one day spike in the VIX mean?” questions, so I have taken the liberty of
    highlighting the ten largest single day VIX spikes over the last 22 years (which
    includes reconstructed VIX calculations). As I see it, these one day spikes are
    typically instances in which a number of investors suddenly get their first glimpse
    of a dark gray swan and they panic, not knowing what is around the corner. For
    the most part, the panic turns out to be an overreaction. Of course, occasionally
    the big spike can look like a precursor of doom in retrospect, as was the case
    on September 29, 2008, when the VIX spiked 34.5%, just before stocks went into
    their plunge. When I see a big VIX spike, however, the first thing I do is get
    out my [mean reversion](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/mean%20reversion)
