For the second time in two months, a front kick to the face ended a major UFC fight. This time, it was Lyoto Machida

to Randy Couture, whereas previously it was Anderson Silva

on Vito Belfort. Machida and Silva are good friends, and both gave credit to action film star Steven Seagal, so I guess he truly deserves credit. It's pretty devastating because the defender is watching his opponents hands, and the kick comes straight up between one's hands. A good shot to the chin is like hitting the power switch on your computer.
