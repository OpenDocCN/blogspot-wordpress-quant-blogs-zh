    had a terrible track record, why should anyone listen to him. Another responded
    that "HSGFX since 11/21/00 is up 61.29%....SPY is up 58.47% (dividends reinvested).....Hussman

    model is terrible and therefore it's time for a divorce. Just remember the tenets
    of diversification. There will always be outperforming managers and models and
    underperforming managers and models. The time to get rid of one is because you
    believe that a model is broken, irrespective of recent returns.

    that the Price to Revenue ratio is an inappropriate way to measure equity valuation.
    The wrong reason to terminate a manager or discard a model is for pure performance
