- en: 'David Sloan Wilson and Omar Eldakar have a neat discussion on group selection
    in evolutionary biology.   They point out that relative fitness is the key to
    assessing evolutionary success, absolute fitness be damned, which fits in nicely
    with my hypothesis that relative utility is more relevant than absolute utility
    functions.  They make this explicit around 21:45-24:15, which is snipped here:'

    minds can think that in any great controversy, one side was mere folly."  I think
    that''s important to remember, and makes for more thoughtful debates, because
    if you habitually caricature the other side as indefensible you clearly are missing
    their essential if not most common arguments.'
