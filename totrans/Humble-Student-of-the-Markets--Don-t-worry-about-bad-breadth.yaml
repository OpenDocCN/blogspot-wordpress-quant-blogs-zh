    Line, which has been showing a series of lower highs and lower lows.

- en: The NYSE A-D Line is based on the components of the NYSE Composite, which is
    a broad based index with many more stocks than the SPX. On a hunch, I decided
    to look at the SPX A-D Line, as an apples-to-apples comparison for the SPX. Lo
    and behold, the SPX A-D Line actually made a new high in the latest advance from
    the August low, which confirms the strength of the rally. As well, the % bullish
    metric (bottom panel) is not showing any negative divergence either.

    a number of closed-end funds, whose price action may not be relevant when calculating
    an A-D Line. As well, the NYSE Composite has more small cap stocks, which does
    measure whether the "generals" or the "troops" of the market are leading the latest
    advance - that's what we are

- en: The chart below shows the NYSE Composite to Equal-weighted SPX ratio as a way
    of measuring the small and large cap effect. As the chart shows, this ratio has
    been falling since the 2009 low. Can this (and therefore the NYSE Composite) be
     a trustworthy indicator of market breadth?

- en: Another way of thinking about underlying strength of the "troops" and "generals"
    is to look at the relative performance of small and large cap stocks. The chart
    below shows the Russell 2000 to SPX ratio. In theory, improving market breadth,
    as measured the small vs. large cap ratio, "should" be a signal of underlying
    strength.

    caps dramatically outperformed small caps during the Tech Bubble of the late 1990s
    and underperformed in the bear market afterwards - which were false signals. On
    the other hand, this ratio did flash advance warning of breadth deterioration
    leading into the 2007 top. Today, it topped out in late 2013 and it has been showing
    a series of lower highs and lower lows.

- en: In summary, evidence of deteriorating breadth comes mainly from broad based
    indices like the NYSE Composite, which is really a measure of small vs. large
    cap performance. This has shown itself to be a unreliable indicator of market
    tops. An apples-to-apples measure of SPX breadth using SPX only components made
    a new high during the most recent advance, which confirms the strength of the
    rally from the August bottom.
