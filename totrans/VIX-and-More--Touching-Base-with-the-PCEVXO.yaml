    the while the volatility indices are printing some extreme numbers, these are
    somewhat mitigated by the rather mild moves in various put to call ratio data.

    the CBOE’s [equity put to call ratio](http://www.cboe.com/publish/ScheduledTask/MktData/datahouse/equityPC.csv),
    you see that equity put volume set a new single day record back on 7/26 and the
    ratio itself peaked on 8/1.  The [ISEE](http://www.ise.com/WebForm/viewPage.aspx?categoryId=126&header3=true&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;menu0=true&link1=true)
    shows more persistent put buying that did not peak until 8/7.

    the [PCVXO](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/PCVXO) in this space,
    an index developed by Jay Kaeppel that combines the put to call and volatility
    data into one aggregate indicator.  While I have no problem using the VXO, which
    is highly correlated to the VIX (as the OEX is to the SPX), I prefer two alternatives
    to Kaeppel’s recommended put to call ratio.  Kaeppel uses the total put to call
    ratio, while I strongly prefer the CBOE’s equity put to call ratio or the ISEE.  For
    the sake of clarity, I will refer to my refinements of the PCVXO as the PCEVXO
    and ISEEVXO, respectively, going forward.'

- en: Looking at the PCEVXO, it printed an all-time high on 8/6 and has been extremely
    overextended ever since, resulting in a very strong bullish signal for the markets.  Not
    surprisingly, the VXO component of that indicator set new records on 8/9, 8/10
    and 8/13.  For comparison purposes, the PCE portion of the indicator set a new
    record on 8/6 and has been dropping slowly ever since.  Interestingly, given the
    magnitude of the VXO readings, the divergence between the record VXO and merely
    very high PCE has also been at an all-time high for the last two sessions.  As
    discussed [back in May](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/05/more-thoughts-on-pcvxo.html),
    when there is a strong divergence, this is also a bullish signal.

    volatility and put to call data indicate that the current situation is the best
    contrarian buying opportunity during the four years for which there is PCEVXO
    data.  That being said, stops and protective puts are always a good idea, particularly
    in skittish markets.

    news flow through Friday’s options expiration.  After that, the back to school
    sale should be over.*
