- en: It's straightforward to explain why a binary set of competing coalitions within
    a collective is common. Given the non-linear political payoff to coalition size--eg,
    when moving from 49% to 51% of the votes--the larger party gains more than it
    loses by letting the minor group add some of their priorities to their platform.
    The minority group joining the larger party, meanwhile, will see its priorities
    relegated to secondary positions but within a ruling or near-ruling party, such
    that their policies will have a higher chance of actually being implemented. When
    there are mutual gains from trade the transaction occurs spontaneously, resulting
    in the bipartisan equilibrium.

    are not as obvious because on many issues the right and left have changed sides,
    such as censorship and the right to free speech. Classical liberalism dominated
    the 19th century and emphasized negative rights, which only require others to
    abstain from interfering with you. These are promoted by left and right for different
    things: the left champions abortion, euthanasia, and recreational drugs, while
    the right champions economic transactions, guns, and homeschooling. President
    Woodrow Wilson was widely seen as a Progressive, but as he led the US into the
    disastrous WW1, leftist intellectuals sought a new term unsullied by this connection
    and chose ''liberalism,'' highlighting the tricky nature of distilling the essence
    of right and left political views.'

    body. Concurrently, humans and other animals have evolved a behavioral immune
    system, which motivates us to avoid situations where we might become exposed to
    infection. Feces and rotting flesh are universally considered bad smells, and
    unsurprisingly contain a lot of dangerous bacteria.  Avoiding potential sources
    of infection has been crucial to our survival, and the motivation to avoid infection
    remains deeply rooted in us to this day.

- en: Supposedly, this behavioral immune system explains the left-right stance on
    immigration. If you are hypersensitive to infection the last thing you want to
    do is to interact with a pathogen source. It operates entirely outside conscious
    awareness, utilizing the emotion of disgust to motivate avoidance of potentially
    infected objects and people. Thus it would explain why the right discourages sexual
    freedom because it leads to sexually transmitted diseases, and also why the right
    sees immigrants as an infection hazard, the way the American Indians

    it's difficult to reach a mutual understanding with reason-based, rational arguments.
    The fear comes from deeply ingrained unconscious systems that one can't control
    any more than one can choose to like the smell of rotting meat. You can discuss
    whether immigrants are a financial gain or burden to society, but if germophobes
    are concerned about an entirely different risk they aren't even fully aware of,
    such arguments will have no resonance.

  zh: 如果有些人通过这些根深蒂固的进化根源看到了移民的危险，想要凭理性和理性的论点达成共识就很困难了。这种恐惧来自于根深蒂固的无意识系统，无法被控制，就像无法选择喜欢腐烂肉的气味一样。你可以讨论移民对社会是财政上的收益还是负担，但是如果患洁癖的人担心完全不自知的另一种风险，这些论点就不会产生共鸣。
- en: As usual, it puts the right into being unreasonable, driven by instinctive heuristics
    now irrelevant as proven by science in peer-reviewed journals. Such evolutionary
    arguments are only popular, if even allowed, among academics for understanding
    bad right-wing beliefs or tendencies. If you apply such reasoning to why women
    or African Americans act or believe in a certain way, it would be immediately
    shot down as sexist or racist if you were explaining anything that was not an
    obviously good thing. Even for advantageous attributes--say why people of West
    African descent dominate sprinting--it is 'problematic,' because it provides a
    slippery slope for explaining disadvantageous attributes, perpetuating oppression. 
    Intellectuals are highly attuned to their particular status hierarchy, needing
    citations, faculty recommendations, and book blurbs. Suggesting the intolerable

    tenuous. My aversion to dirt or sticky things has little valence in my thoughts
    about immigration, but that's my conscious brain working, perhaps puppeteered
    by a hyperactive behavioral immune response. In any case, the Covid-19 pandemic
    is a falsification of this theory. If the right were relatively hypertensive to
    pathogens, the current left-right stance on easing lockdown restrictions would
    be the opposite. The right wants to break the lockdown more than the left. One
    could argue the real factor here is that the right does not value life highly
    relative to economics, but the lockdown is not just opening up factories, but
    beaches, parks, and all sorts of places where people congregate.

  zh: 我认为行为免疫理论与左右派别并不愚蠢，只是牵强。我的对污垢或粘稠物的厌恶对移民问题的想法影响不大，但这是我的意识大脑的运作，也许是受到过度活跃的行为免疫反应的操纵。无论如何，新冠肺炎疫情证伪了这一理论。如果右翼相对过敏于病原体，当前左右翼在放松封锁限制上的立场将会相反。右翼更希望打破封锁比左翼更甚。有人可能会主张真正的因素是右翼相对于经济并不重视生命，但封锁不仅仅是为了开放工厂，还包括海滩、公园和所有人们聚集的地方。
