    adjusted. A comparison of this February vs. February last year shows an improvement.
    As a quick and dirty on a seasonal adjustment, if you compare the sequential change
    last Jan to Feb was 0.4% and so was this year. So maybe even if Gallup is right,
    NFP doesn't come in that badly?

    of the Regional Fed survey that Yardeni depends on is probably lower, though they
    are businesses and not individuals.

    the NFP headline number and the subsequent market reaction is like betting on
    the flip of a coin. At best, the NFP figure is extremely noisy. Even if you had
    an edge, which would be slight given the enormous error term, it would be like
    being the house at a casino where a high roller ambled up to a roulette table
    and put several billions dollars on red. Despite having a slight edge, you would
    be feeling extremely nervous.
