    efficiently over the years," said David Lereah, chief economist of the National
    Association of Realtors and author of "Are You Missing the Real Estate Boom?"
    "It''s as if you had 500,000 dollar bills stuffed in your mattress."'

    company, used a more disparaging term. "If you own your own home free and clear,

    be foolish. Ditech.com touts home loans as a way to pay off credit cards, and
    Morgan Stanley says they're a good way to fund education expenses. Wells Fargo
    suggests taking a chunk out of your house to finance "a dream wedding."

    people say that we should return to common sense, the problem is, how do we know
    what that is? (presumably this is code-speak for everyone should now agree with
    my hindsight diagnosis and cure).
