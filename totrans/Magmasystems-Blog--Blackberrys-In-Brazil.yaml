    Paolo, and we were talking about the work/life balance. I was asking him if he
    checked his Blackberry as soon as he got home, and he gave me the most astonishing
    reply. It seems that, unless you are on support rota (ie: on call), if you respond
    to a work-related message on your mobile device, then the company has to pay you
    overtime. So, as a rule, most banks do not give their employees company Blackberries.'

    I responded to email at home? While climbing the Canadian Rockies? While drinking
    Cidra at a bar in Spain? Imagine how much nicer my vacations could have been if
    I had been forced to be disconnected from work?
