# Humble Student of the Markets: A bottom in gold?

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2014/02/a-bottom-in-gold.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2014/02/a-bottom-in-gold.html#0001-01-01)

The price of gold and gold stocks have been behaving a lot better in the past few weeks and it has prompted a number of technicians to proclaim a bottom in gold. I have found that inter-market analysis can tell us a lot more about the underlying technical picture of an asset than a pure technical focus on the asset itself. My own take is that we are seeing a tradable tactical bottom, but don't count on an intermediate or long term bottom in gold.

**Non-confirmation from silver**

The main basis for my conclusion is the behavior of the silver/gold ratio. Silver is said to be the poor man's gold and tends to have a higher precious metal beta. The chart below shows the gold price in the top panel and the silver/gold ratio in the bottom panel.

Note how gold has rallied out of a downtrend in the top chart, which is what got a lot of technicians and goldbugs excited. By contrast, the silver/gold ratio remains in a downtrend. If gold has staged a convincing bottom, why isn't silver participating?

Now look at this same chart back at the last gold bottom at about the $250 level in 1999 and 2001\. Note how the silver/gold ratio turned up well before the first gold bottom. Now look at the first chart of the current silver/gold ratio and tell me that we are seeing a durable bottom in the gold price.

**A tactical buy?**

The combination of a gold rally out of a downtrend and a falling silver/gold ratio suggests that we are more likely to see a period of consolidation or tactical rally in the gold price. A realistic upside rally target might be the 1400-1460 resistance zone, which is roughly where the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level is.

**Don't shoot the messenger**

If you are a goldbug and want to write me about how the Yellen Fed is overly dovish and stands ready to print and debase the currency, etc., I refer you to my favorite analysis from

. While it is somewhat dated, the truths about goldbugs remains eternal.
