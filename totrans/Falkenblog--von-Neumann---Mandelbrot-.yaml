    it. It is a 'straw man', easy to knock down. I thought this was a discredited
    technique that would generally make the author look bad, but the more I read popular
    books, the more I see this approach taken. Best selling critics of the free market,
    such as John Kenneth Gallbraith and Lester Thurow, would criticize any misfortune
    as an anomaly to libertarians who thought markets were perfect.

    I would like. The book has its moments, and its short chapters and easy reading
    make it a great book to read while drinking a cup of coffee, and then return to
    the stack. The book has lots of graphs and tables. I love books with graphs and
    tables, and wish more books did, as I find it odd that a 300 page book on investing
    would not have these thing (eg, Against the Gods, or Random Walk Down Wall Street
    has but a few), as these make points so much better than mere words. So bully
    for Mauboussin. But he had a chapter on "frequency versus magnitude in expected
    value", and highlighted that some really smart people like Warren Buffet assess
    expected value as probability times payoff, so an improbable event may actually
    be a good buy, because its payoff is sufficiently large. Who knew? He even quotes
    my favorite flâneur, Nassim Taleb, for noting that as a trader he would be short
    sometimes even when he thought the market was going up, because the size of a
    downturn would make the expected return negative [forget about the fact that trading
    floors hate it when their traders have directional bets]. Supposedly, most rubes
    merely look at the probabilities, ignoring payoffs.'

    It has always been that way. To think this is subtle, or rare, strikes me as daffy,
    after all, most options expire worthless, yet have a positive price. Contradiction?
    No.

    the workhorse of most economic analysis. He had a macro model too, but I think
    it''s safe to say that was a noble effort, but a dead end. But Mandelbrot? He
    is usually the first reference of fat tails for financial distributions based
    on a 1963 article on cotton prices, but I fail to see this as a truly earth-shattering
    finding because almost everything natural has fatter tails than a normal (gaussian)
    distribution, so who was suspecting otherwise? Mandlelbrot''s book points out
    (and so does Mauboussin''s) that the stock market has fat tails, and states that
    models like Black-Scholes, and the CAPM, are based on the Gaussian hegemony that
    forces us to think that such things can only have normal distributions, a legacy
    of Bachelier from his work on brownian motion in 1903\. But these models use the
    Gaussian model as an expositional device, because it generates nice, clean closed
    form solutions. Markowitz''s earliest book (Portfolio Selection: Efficient Diversification
    of Investments, 1959) looked at semi-deviation, maximum loss, and other asymmetric
    loss functions. Thus since the very beginnings of the MPT, researchers have been
    aware that distributional assumptions were important, and obvious paths for alternative
    hypotheses. Looking at the Journal of Portfolio Management, “skewness” is mentioned
    in no less than 66 articles, kurtosis in 44\. The bottom line is that after 40
    years, this obvious fix—adding a cube or square term, effectively—appears only
    episodically as a solution, invariably not standing up to subsequent scrutiny.'

    you believe that no one knows this, or at least, that The Establishment thinks
    Gaussian distributions are perfect replications of reality. The 1987 crash was
    a 22 standard deviation event, happening once every 60 bazillion years according
    to the Gaussian knaves. Now truly people did not anticipate this, because the
    previous largest move was less than 10%, but I don't think his model is any great
    improvement because anticipating a 22 stdev movement in any option with a significant
    probability will cause you to overpay severely for illiquid options with wide
