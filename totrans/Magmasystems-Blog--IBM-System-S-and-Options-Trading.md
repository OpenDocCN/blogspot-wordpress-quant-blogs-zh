Press release

[here](http://before-you-invest.com/ibm-unveils-prototype-options-trading-system/)"IBM unveiled a prototype of an automated options trading system. During the project, scientists at IBM Research collaborated with TD Securities to achieve a 21 times performance improvement on the volume of data consumed by financial trading systems."

Glad to see that System S is finally seeing the light of day.

Opher, any comments?
