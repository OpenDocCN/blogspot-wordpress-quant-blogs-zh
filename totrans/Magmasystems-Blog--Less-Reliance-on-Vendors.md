# Magmasystems Blog: Less Reliance on Vendors

> 来源：[http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2006/12/less-reliance-on-vendors.html#0001-01-01](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2006/12/less-reliance-on-vendors.html#0001-01-01)

Even though there are a lot of things to be desired about working at Morgan Stanley, I must say that they have got the right idea about lessening their reliance on vendors. Their EIA group has their own XML-based pub/sub message bus (CPS), their own market data infrastructure (Filter), their own .NET client-side framework, and more. What they have done is cut companies like Tibco out of the loop, and are no longer beholden to vendor release cycles, upgrade fees, and huge licensing costs. Morgan owns the source, and has the staff to maintain and enhace their IP. In fact, a friend of mine at Morgan told me that, if they wanted to, Morgan could take CPS and give Tibco a run for their money.
