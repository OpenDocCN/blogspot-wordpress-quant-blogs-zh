- en: Ruling China has always been a difficult prospect, as the country is riven with
    urban-rural and coastal-interior splits. But while the Olympics were supposed
    to have been a celebration of China's "arrival" as a modern state, they are instead
    serving as a showcase for all the ways in which China falls short. But dealing
    with these issues — entrenched corruption, financial dysfunction, (unapproved)
    regional autonomy, unaffordable energy subsidies — is difficult for Beijing in
    the weeks leading up to the Olympics because, under the glare of international
    spotlights, it can no longer use the tried-and-true tools of an authoritarian
    state. ***The result is a string of patchwork fixes that highlight China's weaknesses,
    making the Asian giant vulnerable to any foreign power with an interest in demonstrating
    that the emperor is less than fully clothed. Not exactly the global celebration
    that Beijing intended when it bid for the

    While one data point does not make a slowdown, it does point to a trend of slowing
    growth, which would be negative for commodity prices.

- en: We remain in a hard asset cycle and the long-term fundamentals for commodity
    remain intact. However, investors need to be prepared for commodity corrections,
    which can be nasty and violent. The chart below shows the price action of the
    Continuous Commodity Index, which the old equal weighted CRB index before CRB
    went to a liquidity weighting. The index has moved up tremendously in the last
    few years and the bull trend can still remain intact should we see a 20% correction.
