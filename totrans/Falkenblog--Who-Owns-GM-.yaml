    pension plan, compared to only $13 billion that it paid out in dividends.

- en: . It's a really good read, in that it highlights the problem of unions and pensions.
    Its easy to give pensions to unions to buy peace, putting the problem off on future
    generations. In the UAW, the pensioners vote, even though they aren't working,
    so these demands for pensions aren't going away. After all, most senior management
    won't be around in 10 years. Bankruptcy seems the only logical outcome. Another
    reason why the Detroit auto industry is doomed.

    sector, because there, the union workers can vote out politicians who don't protect,
    if not increase, these non-cash benefits.
