- en: Yesterday I looked at how the S&P has responded following drops of 5% or more.
    Most often is has led to a bounce. Thursday failed – and in a big way as instead
    of bouncing it fell another 5%. The only time going back to 1960 that the S&P
    has fallen 5% for 2 days in a row was during the Crash of 87.

- en: Since my Dow history file goes back to 1920 I decided to look at that. There
    have been 4 times that the Dow dropped 5% or more 2 days in a row. They were all
    between 1929 and 1933.

    the parameters to 4%. Results below:'

    One of the instances included above was the Crash of 1987\. The rest of them all
    took place between 1929 and 1940.

    came up “1987” or “between 1929 and 1940”.
