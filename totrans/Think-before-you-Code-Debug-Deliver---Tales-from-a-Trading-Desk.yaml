- en: Rob Pike’s “The Best Programming [advice](http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1941206)
    I Ever Got” is spot on in terms of thinking.  However, its not just specific to
    writing code 🙂  I think the real key piece of advice for anyone working as part
    of a team delivering a software solution to the “business” is to ensure they think
    before they undertake the task they have picked up from the [kanban](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board)
    board.  Likewise, when they hit a perceived problem, thought should be applied
    to ensure that they are thinking about a problem which will aid in delivery of
    the software application, and not a problem that has occurred because the individual
    has side tracked down an alley because its slightly more interesting that the
    actual task they are suppose to be working on.

    deliverable will be used by the rest of the team in the delivery of the solution. 
    So often individualw within an agile team work using a silo approach (yes, I know
    its a contradiction to agile) even though they are part of an “agile” team, with
    little thought to the “pain” they might incur on other team members post delivery
    of their story – be it code, backlogs, stories, UX, etc.

    Code” for software development?
