    exchange information. Rather, it's simply a ritual of exchanging 'strokes' that
    build trust and convey interest and empathy, that is all. There are all sorts
    of such rules that are culture dependent, why it is so important for children
    to learn 'how to be polite', which means, how to engage in everyday banter that
    isn't about what it's superficially about.  I remember as a child finding the
    phrase 'how are you?' to make little sense (no one wanted to know!), and wish
    I read this at 13.

    Berne's book is geared towards cases when people engage in repetitive behavior
    where both parties appear to having a continued struggle, but really are in a
    rut that is at some level satisfying to both, as when an argument between family
    members always ends with doors being slammed.

    themselves, sad sacks who make similar mistakes over and over, and seem totally
    oblivious to their bad habits of thought. They rely on a strange cognitive dissonance
    that keeps them from really seeing themselves. I noticed it once in myself when
    I met an old college friend and he said, 'remember when you did X because Y!'
    I don't want to go into it (X and Y weren't that shocking), but in any case I
    had remembered my reason for X as being more reasonable. I then realized it was
    obvious I had lied to myself for decades.

    than our inner narrator). Indeed, the most unethical person I ever hope to know
    emphasized to me several times that 'honesty' was the most important thing to
    him, and he was probably unaware at a conscious level this was precisely because
    he knew how much he lied about important things. And so it is with many experts
    who not only lie to themselves, but do so about things they are expert at, or
    prioritize. Consider that active portfolio managers lie about their alpha, partisan
    intellectuals distort their opponent's arguments to make them easier to dismiss,
    and politicians lie about being leaders rather than slavish followers.

    and coming up with clever solutions like Arthur Conan Doyle for personal problems
    using allusions to Greek literature and sex, all very impressive.  It allowed
    him to believe he was like a Newton for the human soul. He was lying to himself
    that he had discovered such laws in our thoughts.  This is not a paradox, it's
    the human condition, because for many of us clarity on the things most important
    to us is depressing.  It takes courage to see oneself objectively because we are
    all fallible and imperfect, and prefer not to think about our faults but rather
    the faults of others.

    as much about life, even if not at their frenetic pace. I notice many adults adopt
    habits of thought and behavior that go pretty unchanged after a certain point.
     It's as if they tire of the grief that comes with learning we are going about
    things sub-optimally because this causes us to re-evaluate all sorts of things
    about ourselves. Thus, wisdom seems to flat-line as opposed to increase throughout
    life like for Plato. I definitely want to avoid being one of those people others
    know better than I know myself.
