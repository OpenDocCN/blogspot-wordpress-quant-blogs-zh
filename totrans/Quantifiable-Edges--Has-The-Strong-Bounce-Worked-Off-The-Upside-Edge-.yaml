- en: After being strongly oversold the market has bounced back quite nicely the last
    1½  days.  The effect has basically been to work off the oversold condition and
    leave several indices just a little above their 10-day moving averages.  In other
    words, it has been a quick trip from near-panic to fairly neutral.  Had the reversal
    not been so strong then the current upside potential would be a little better.
     But since the move was so good (and I’m not complaining), it took out much of
    the upside edge.  I demonstrated this in last night’s subscriber letter.

  zh: 在强烈超卖后，市场在过去1.5天里已经很好地反弹。这种效应基本上是消除了超卖状况，并使几个指数稍微高于其10日均线。换句话说，市场从接近恐慌状态迅速转变为相当中性。如果反转没有这么强烈，那么当前的上行潜力会稍微更好。但由于这一移动非常出色（而且我并不抱怨），它消除了很多上行动能。我昨晚在订阅者的信中展示了这一点。
- en: There I looked at patterns similar to the current one where SPY made a 10-day
    intraday low on day 1 and then posted an unfilled gap up along with a close above
    the open (and above the 200ma) the next day, as it did on Friday.  I broke it
    down by instances that closed above the 10ma versus instances that closed below
    it.

  zh: 在那里，我查看了与当前情况相似的模式，其中SPY在第一天创造了10天的日内低点，然后第二天出现了未填补的跳空上涨，并且收盘价高于开盘价（以及高于200日均线）。就像上周五一样。我将它分解为收盘价高于10日均线的情况与收盘价低于10日均线的情况。
- en: So the current situation falls into the 2nd category.  Wins & losses are basically
    breakeven but the losses were a bit bigger.  I don’t view this as a bearish edge,
    but I think it demonstrates my point fairly well.  Had we not bounced so much,
    we would have a better chance of seeing more follow-though.  As is, it appears
    some caution and perhaps some profit-taking is warranted.

  zh: 所以当前情况属于第二类。胜负基本上是盈亏平衡，但亏损稍微大一些。我不认为这是一个看跌的优势，但我认为它很好地证明了了我的观点。如果我们没有反弹那么多，我们将有更好的机会看到更多的跟涨。目前，似乎有些谨慎和或许有些获利了结是合适的。
