- en: One of the more interesting trading setups is something I call the [disaster
    trade](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/disaster%20trade). This type
    of trade typically sets up after a stock experiences a crushing blow, crashes
    once or twice and has shorts swirling all around it betting that the company will
    either fail or become permanently crippled.

    is currently experiencing.

- en: One different sort of way to use options to try to capitalize on the BP situation
    with limited risk is through the use of a [put backspread](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/put%20backspread)
    or a [call backspread](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/call%20backspread).
    A put backspread involves selling a smaller quantity of puts at a higher strike
    and buying a larger amount of puts at a lower strike. Depending upon market factors,
    this trade can be either a credit or a debit. In the first graphic below, the
    trade costs $25 to enter (before commissions.)

    which was mapped out with BP trading at 31.64 and is structured here as short
    10 BP July 30 puts and long 15 BP July 27.50 puts. From a high level perspective,
    three things can happen with this trade:'

    per point

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The trade loses money if BP settles in the 22.45 – 30.00 range, with a maximum
    loss of $2525 at 27.50

- en: In sum, a disaster pays off; a mild decline will be painful; and any move up,
    sideways or slightly down move just about breaks even. (In this case the 15:10
    ratio means a $25 loss, but if the ratio were smaller, the sideways to up move
    would result in a profit. For example, buying 14 July 27.50 puts instead of 15
    increases the profitability by $139, so any close over 30 would result in a $114
    profit instead of a $25 loss.)

- en: I have included the second graphic to show how optionsXpress uses a [lognormal
    distribution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-normal_distribution) to translate
    existing options data into an expected probability distribution at the time the
    July options expire. This helps to visualize the strategy and reinforces the fact
    that the put backspread is a fat tail disaster play.

- en: Of course, one could flip these graphics around and have a call backspread trade,
    such as short 10 July 32 calls and long 15 July 35 calls. Here the small profit
    (about $700 in the example immediately above) would be on the down side and the
    upward sloping portion of the profit curve would be consistent with a rally instead
    of a crash.

- en: If you see a beaten down stock that you expect to bounce back strongly, yet
    still want to make money if the stock continues to sell off, put backspreads are
    worth investigating. The can be done with out-of-the-money options, as is the
    case with the examples shown here, using in-the-money-options or with a blend
    of the two. More broadly, when disaster strikes and you want to place a bet on
    the situation worsening or improving, backspreads are an interesting way to do
    so with a defined risk approach.
