- en: I examined Monday reactions to very bad Fridays. While Friday didn’t qualify
    for that study, I did look at large Friday drops another way this weekend. This
    time I used Average True Range (ATR) to define “large”. If the size of the drop
    was larger than 1.5 times the 20-day ATR then regardless of the size of the %
    drop, that was considered “large”. Drops of this magnitude on a Friday have almost
    always led to a bounce.

- en: An 88% bounce rate the next day is extremely impressive – especially considering
    the study is only based on 2 simple parameters (day of week and large drop). The
    Crash of ’87 occurred on a Monday after a sizable drop on Friday. The Crash of
    ’29 also occurred on a Monday. It seems that Wall St.’s collective consciousness
    since over the last several years calls for protecting yourself going into the
    weekend if Friday is bad. This suggests that big drops on Fridays have often been
    overreactions and have therefore resulted in a consistent propensity to bounce
    on Monday.
