## Insider trading

### September 19, 2006

Just had another one of those [Harris](http://www.tradingandexchanges.com) moments reading 14.6.2.1 in Harris on spreads. He points out that “markets that effectively enforce insider trading rules protect their liquidity suppliers from [adverse selection](https://etrading.wordpress.com/2006/08/31/adverse-selection-and-uninformed-traders/).” Since adverse selection widens spreads, this benefits all traders relying on dealer supplied liquidity to execute their investment strategies.
