    for real time push up to a browser client using [websockets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket).
    Then I was building a proof of concept. I’ve come a lot further since; I’m now
    building the beta of my product. I’m still using tornado on the server side, and
    I’ve adopted Twitter’s [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) framework for the
    browser GUI. There’s a bit of a learning curve to become productive in Bootstrap
    & [jQuery](http://jquery.com/). But it’s been worthwhile, and I’ve been pleasantly
    surprised by how far browser GUI development has advanced in the last five years.
    Anyway, the purpose of this post is to flag an excellent resource for anyone digging
    deeper into tornado server dev: [Oscar Vilaplana](http://oscarvilaplana.cat/)‘s
    [Tornado In Depth Europython talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ztq-Yz1ero).
    There’s no sound on that youtube video for the first couple of minutes, and even
    after that the audio is a little scratchy. But bear with it. Oscar spends an hour
    walking you through tornado based code and the supporting internals, and makes
    it all beautifully simple. All the examples from his talk can be [found here on
    bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/grimborg/tornado-in-depth/src/tip/examples/).
    Thanks Oscar!'
