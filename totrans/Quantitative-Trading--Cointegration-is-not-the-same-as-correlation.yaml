- en: A reader asked me recently why I believe that energy stock prices (e.g. XLE)
    are correlated with crude oil futures front-month contract (QM). Actually I don’t
    believe they are necessarily correlated – I only think they are “cointegrated”.

- en: What is the difference between correlation and cointegration? If XLE and QM
    were really correlated, when XLE goes up one day, QM would likely go up also on
    the same day, and vice versa. Their daily (or weekly, or monthly) returns would
    have risen or fallen in synchrony. But that’s not what my [analysis](http://epchan.blogspot.com/2006/10/arbitrage-trade-between-energy-stocks.html)
    was about. I claim that XLE and QM are cointegrated, meaning that the two price
    series cannot wander off in opposite directions for very long without coming back
    to a mean distance eventually. But it doesn’t mean that on a daily basis the two
    prices have to move in synchrony at all.

    A and stock B are correlated. You can see that their prices move in the same direction
    almost everyday.

- en: '![](img/01a8717fda92dd66fb79f1b7d915da79.png)Stock C clearly doesn’t move in
    any correlated fashion with stock A: some days they move in same direction, other
    days opposite. Most days stock C doesn’t move at all! But notice that the spread
    in stock prices between C and A always return to about $1 after a while. This
    is a manifestation of cointegration between A and C. In this instance, a profitable
    trade would be to buy A and short C at around day 10, then exit both positions
    at around day 19\. Another profitable trade would be to buy C and short A at around
    day 31, then closing out the positions around day 40.'

- en: Cointegration is the foundation upon which pair trading (“statistical arbitrage”)
    is built. If two stocks simply move in a correlated manner, there may never be
    any widening of the spread. Without a temporary widening of the spread in either
    direction, there is no opportunity to short (or buy) the spread, and no reason
    to expect the spread to revert to the mean either.
