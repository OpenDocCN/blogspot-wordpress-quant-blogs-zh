# Humble Student of the Markets: Not enough panic?

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2012/05/not-enough-panic.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2012/05/not-enough-panic.html#0001-01-01)

As stocks have descended in the last few weeks, investor sentiment measures have moved into zones indicating excessive fear. As an example, the

[Citigroup Panic/Euphoria model](http://www.businessinsider.com/citi-panic-resurfaces-2012-5)

is in the "panic" territory, which is contrarian bullish.

Numerous other indicators, such as the

[Ticker Sense Blogger Survey](http://tickersense.typepad.com/ticker_sense/2012/05/may-21st-blogger-sentiment-poll.html)

, to which I contribute and voted "bearish" last week, also confirms the observation that there are too many bears.

**Watch what they do, not what they say**

What's bothering me is that while all these sentiment surveys point to excessive bearishness, market based indicators such as the VIX Index is not showing very much fear at all.

Remember, what what they do, not what they say. While I have

[written before](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.ca/2012/05/time-to-sell-on-strength.html)

that this market is deeply oversold and due for a relief rally, these readings are suggestive that there is more downside before we see an intermediate term bottom.
