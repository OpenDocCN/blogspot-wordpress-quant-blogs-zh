    tool in financial [econometrics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Econometrics), especially
    dominant in both [technical analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_analysis)
    and [high-frequency trading](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_frequency_trading).
    Given the sophistication of both disciplines, one is inclined to beg the question
    why such a seemingly trivial statistical technique as moving averages form a core
    of their foundation.'

    implication for building trading systems.

    for financial instruments can be represented by such ![x_{t}](img/c9ee8521744943eacfa0235a5d6d9d12.png),
    particularly those in high-frequency finance* (namely, those which are zero-mean,
    autocovariance stationary [white noise](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_noise)).
    In other words, many price series are generated by processes which are precisely
    moving averages. This is an elegant and unexpected theoretical result.'

    conclusion does not tend to apply to low-frequency price series, such as daily
    data. This difference between low- and high-frequency data again harks back to
    the stationarity principle introduced by the [Three Horsemen](https://quantivity.wordpress.com/2009/07/25/bias-stationarity-ergodicity/).'

    above originate are the [Wold theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wold%27s_theorem)
    and Ansley, Spivey, and Wrobleski ([On the Structure of Moving Average Prices](http://econpapers.repec.org/article/eeeeconom/v_3a6_3ay_3a1977_3ai_3a1_3ap_3a121-134.htm)).
    For those interested in high-frequency trading, Hasbrouck covers this result and
    its relationship to the [Roll microstructure model](http://www.jstor.org/pss/2327617)
    nicely in [Empirical Market Microstructure](http://books.google.com/books?id=7U3Oo4ldKgYC&dq=empirical+market+microstructure&source=gbs_navlinks_s).
