- en: On Wednesday SPY made a 20-day low before reversing to close higher. During
    long-term uptrends these kind of reversals have typically shown an upside edge.
    Below is a study from last night’s subscriber letter that demonstrates this.

    curve using a 5-day exit so that you may see how the edge has played out over
    time.

    confidence in the results.
