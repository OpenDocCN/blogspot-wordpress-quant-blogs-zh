    Mac and say they've lost $33 billion, supposedly, as a result of buying these
    bad mortgages, and therefore, those losses should be put back to the banking system.
    But in essence, if we establish the precedent that anyone can sue a bank if they
    get a mortgage that doesn't work out, and there were $5 trillion of mortgages
    that were securitized through this Fannie-Freddie system over the past number
    of years. I have no idea how many people would sue, nor how much the courts are
    willing to give back to these companies and take away from the banks. It's a very,
    very negative development.
