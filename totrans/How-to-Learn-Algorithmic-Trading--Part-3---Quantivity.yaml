- en: Third in a series on learning quantitative / algorithmic trading, this post
    focuses on financial modeling and analysis, assuming understanding of financial
    mathematics from [Part 2](https://quantivity.wordpress.com/2010/01/12/how-to-learn-algorithmic-trading-part-2/)
    and overview of quantitative trading from [Part 1](https://quantivity.wordpress.com/2010/01/10/how-to-learn-algorithmic-trading/).
    After digesting these, readers should be capable of both building interesting
    systematic trading systems and understanding microstructure dynamics that drive
    modern market making (sell side) and large block trading (buy side).
