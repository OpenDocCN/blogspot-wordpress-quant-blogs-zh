    that I finally decided to put up a summary post that discusses various aspects
    of the mechanics of the EVALS model portfolio as well as some performance data.
    In [EVALS Q1 2012 Update](http://vixandmoreevals.blogspot.com/2012/04/evals-q1-2012-update.html),
    I address such issues as monthly returns, maximum drawdown, trading frequency,
    average holding period, correlation with the SPX, etc. for the first 4 ½ months
    since inception.

    on VIX Exchange-Traded Products](http://vixandmoreevals.blogspot.com/2011/12/evals-relaunches-now-focusing-on-vix.html)
    might also be of interest. Readers who wish to see a graphic that explains the
    differences between the content in this blog, in the [newsletter](http://vixandmoresubscriber.blogspot.com/)
    and in EVALS are encouraged to review the content pyramid in [Five Years of VIX
    and More](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2012/01/five-years-of-vix-and-more.html).

    [EVALS blog](http://vixandmoreevals.blogspot.com/), I will disclose that there
    you will find some information relating to the 52.60% return in EVALS in the 4
    ½ months since the November 17, 2011 launch.
