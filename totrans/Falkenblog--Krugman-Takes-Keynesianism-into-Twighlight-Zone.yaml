    why not just reduce taxes across the board? It would be far simpler and faster.
    I suspect because the real objective is redistribution, and lower tax rates across
    the board is regressive on a dollar basis even if proportionately the same. Too
    bad, but it highlights that old maxim I learned in

    In this case, the real wish of Keynesians is to redistribute wealth via the government,
    giving bureaucrats more power over the bourgeois. If it were otherwise it would
    be too easy to stimulate the economy in short order via their model of the economy.

    in real time, as full employment is something people apply to the past; the present
    is always below its potential, seemingly. This is why spending more is so problematic,
    because it is very improbable that such spending will be temporary as opposed
    to part of the new baseline, all to work on fighting aliens, or whatever they
    do in the Department of Education.
