    S&P 500 index last week.  Even with last week’s sub-par performance, since the
    February 16, 2007 inception, Portfolio A1 now has a cumulative gain of 20.7%,
    compared to a 3.7% loss for the SPX.

    (SNP)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=snp) has been dropped from the portfolio,
    victim of a rule whereby a position is automatically closed once it falls 20%
    from its high during the ownership period.  Also dropped were Norwegian energy
    and aluminum giant [Norsk Hydro (NHYDY)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=nhydy),
    but in this instance as a result of a declining rank from the stock ranking system.  The
    ranking system partly reflects several technical factors and picked up on the
    fact that NHYDY’s stock has also struggled and is down about 17% for the first
    two weeks of 2008.

    (FDP)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=fdp) and a second Brazilian telecom
    company:  [Tele Norte Leste Participacoes (TNE)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=tne),
    an integrated fixed line and mobile telecom provider with a $9.5 billion market
    cap.  TNE joins long-time favorite [BRP](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=brp)
    to give Portfolio A1 an unusual mix of 2/5 Brazilian telecoms in this five-legged
    portfolio.  By design a focused five stock portfolio is intended to make significant
    bets in specific sectors and regions, but it is unusual to find this type of concentration
    in the portfolio, which uses a maximum sector weighting of 30% to place sector
    limits on all new purchases.  The reason there are currently two telecom companies
    in the portfolio is that [Mosaic (MOS)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=mos)
    has had such a strong run (up 175.7%) that it now comprises 42% of the portfolio,
    so that it is possible for the other four holdings to split the remaining 58%
    with two companies in one sector that do not total to 30%.'
