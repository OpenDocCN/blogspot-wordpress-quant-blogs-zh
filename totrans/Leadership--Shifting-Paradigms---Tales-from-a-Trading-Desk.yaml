- en: Page 15 – “You can buy a man’s time; you can buy his physical presence at a
    given place; you can even buy a measured number of his skilled muscular motions
    per hour.  Buy you cannot buy enthusiasm…You cannot buy loyalty…You cannot buy
    devotion of hearts, minds, or souls. You must earn these” – Clarence Francis. 
    Great opening quote for a book.
