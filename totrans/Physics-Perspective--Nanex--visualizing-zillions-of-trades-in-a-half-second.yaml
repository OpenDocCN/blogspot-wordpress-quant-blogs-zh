- en: ', I learned of the video below produced by Nanex, the market data analysis
    company in Chicago. It runs for just under 6 minutes and shows all the quotes
    for Johnson & Johnson stock racing among a network of exchanges over just one
    half second of real time. Watch the whole thing and then remember -- this is just
    one half second (the clock, bottom middle, goes up in increments of milliseconds).
    Below the video, some explanation of what you''re seeing from Nanex.'

    they didn’t understand market structure or the importance of latency and the consolidated
    feed. That was several years ago. We still aren’t sure if they get it, or are
    just playing dumb.

    changes in the blink of an eye.

    quotes in the stock of Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) through our financial networks
    on May 2, 2013\. Video shows 1/2 second of time. If any of the connections are
    not running perfectly, High Frequency Traders can profit from the price discrepancies
    that result. There is no economic justification for this abusive behavior.

    o’clock. It shows the National Best Bid/Offer. Watch how much it changes in a
    fraction of a second. The shapes represent quote changes which are the result
    of a change to the top of the book at each exchange. The time at the bottom of
    the screen is Eastern Time HH:MM:SS:mmm (mmm = millisecond). We slow time down
    so you can see what goes on at the millisecond level. A millisecond (ms) is 1/1000th
    of a second.

    trade through price protection. This complex web of technology must run flawlessly
    every millisecond of the trading day, or arbitrage (HFT profit) opportunities
    will appear. It is easy for HFTs to cause delays in one or more of the connections
    between each exchange.
