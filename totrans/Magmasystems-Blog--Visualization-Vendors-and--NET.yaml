- en: We have seen a whole slew of enterprise visualization products lately ... Tableau,
    Spotfire, RTView, and others that I cannot talk about.

- en: Almost none of these vendors have components that can be embedded in a .NET
    UserControl. Almost all of these visualization suites are complete desktop or
    web-based apps. Many of these DO NOT deal with real-time, streaming data.

    This company is slowly moving beyond there core competency of Heatmaps and are
    staring to offer various other useful visualizations.

- en: To the visualization vendors who call me and are puzzled why I have not considered
    their products ... we need .NET components. We have a container that hosts different
    "applets" that run at the same time, each applet containing a .NET UserControl
    that, in turn, contain different visualizations.
