# Humble Student of the Markets: Buy signals everywhere

**Mid-week market update:**

One of the most reliable trading signals occur when an indicator becomes oversold and mean reverts to neutral (buy signal), or if it gets overbought and mean reverts to neutral (sell signal). We saw numerous versions of buy signals of that variety from the VIX Index this week.

Consider, for example, the VIX/VXV ratio as a measure of the VIX term structure. When this ratio rises above 1, that is an inverted term structure indicating market fear. As the chart below shows, the VIX/VXV ratio inverted last week and returned to a normal upward sloping curve on Monday.

I went back to November 2007 and studied past instances of this buy signal. Historically, such episodes have resolved themselves bullishly.

That's not all! There is more good news from the VIX for the bulls.
