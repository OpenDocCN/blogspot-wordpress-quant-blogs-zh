    2009\. From a distance, that is typically what it looks like when I try to call
    a bottom.

    what would return at least 60% a year or so ago, but the tricky part is that so
    many were reluctant to pull the trigger.

- en: Fortunately, when there was the first whiff of a possible bottom, I was lucky
    enough to be fishing from a sea of heavily shorted positions and assembled a portfolio
    of stocks in which at least 30% of the float was short and the average volume
    in the stock was at least 500,000 million shares. I first unveiled these ideas
    in [Short Covering Driving Today’s Gains](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/03/short-covering-driving-todays-gains.html)
    on March 10, 2009 and later followed up with a discussion of the performance of
    that portfolio in [Short Covering Rally Data Points](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/05/short-covering-rally-data-points.html)
    on May 1, 2009, at which point the average holding had already more than doubled.

    [CBL](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/CBL), [MAC](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/MAC),
    [MGM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/MGM)) have gained more than
    400%. The two laggards are PALM, down almost 40%, and [TLT](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TLT),
    the long bond ETF, which is down about 10% after dividends and is omitted from
    the chart of equities and equity ETFs below.

    to run, but in my next post, I will look at some current heavy [short interest](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/short%20interest)
    plays and see whether the shorts have the odds in their favor this time around.
