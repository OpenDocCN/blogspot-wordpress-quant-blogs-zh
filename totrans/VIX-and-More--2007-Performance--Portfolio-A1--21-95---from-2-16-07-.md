# VIX and More: 2007 Performance: Portfolio A1 +21.95% (from 2/16/07)

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/01/2007-performance-portfolio-a1-2195-from.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/01/2007-performance-portfolio-a1-2195-from.html#0001-01-01)

I am official closing the books on 2007 for Portfolio A1 with a 21.95% gain since the portfolio’s February 16^(th) inception.  This performance is 21.07% better than that of the SPX during the same period.

In addition to the usual portfolio summary statistics and equity curve, I have included some additional graphics that should be largely self-explanatory.
