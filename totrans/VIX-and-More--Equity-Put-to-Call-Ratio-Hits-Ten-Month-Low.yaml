    stocks are overbought, at least on a short-term basis.

    which, along with the [ISEE](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/ISEE),
    is one of my two favorite [put to call](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/put%20to%20call)
    ratios.

    to call activity at the CBOE. The daily data are represented by the dotted blue
    lines; I also use a 10 day exponential moving average to smooth the data over
    a two week period. I find that the 10 day EMA gives excellent contrarian signals.
    The most recent low in the 10 day EMA was at the beginning of the year and was
    a slightly early sell signal. The last time the 10 day EMA was this low was in
    May 2008, when it was an even more timely sell signal.

    week can sometimes delay trend reversals by a few days, but by Monday, the trend
    is likely to be back down.
