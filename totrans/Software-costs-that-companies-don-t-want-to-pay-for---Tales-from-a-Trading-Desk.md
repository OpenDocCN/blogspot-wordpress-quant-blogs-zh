# Software costs that companies don’t want to pay for | Tales from a Trading Desk

## Software costs that companies don’t want to pay for

Software costs money.  I realise this is obvious, but its more interesting to look at what companies are prepare to pay for, and what they are not.

Most companies are happy to pay for UI/UX work, as they see what they get, and they perceive the are getting value because of the visual nature of the deliverable

Similarly, paying for the creation of documents seems acceptable to most companies.

What companies don’t seem interested in paying for is:

1.  Continuous delivery pipeline creation (e.g. Jenkins pipeline), and the ongoing maintenance costs (turning etc)
2.  Server side architecture
3.  Integration
4.  Testing/performance
5.  Exploratory costs before work is started
6.  Refactoring to allow teams to maintain velocity

The first bullet point above is shocking, because without a few cycle time, the companies are actually paying every day, or maybe even every hour, which is going to impact velocity, which the company will pay for in some shape or form

Disappointing 😦
