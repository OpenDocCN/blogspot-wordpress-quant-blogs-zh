    a cautionary tale for the gold standard cheerleaders who would like to return
    to an era of rigid monetary policy and fixed exchange rates. The modern story
    of Greece is the tale of a country locked into a currency that it cannot print
    or devalue.

    the worst depressions in recent memory. At its trough in the first quarter of
    2014—which was revised lower in today’s report—the decline in Greek GDP was roughly
    33% from the peak. That’s actually worse than the US peak-to-trough GDP decline
    of 27% between 1929 and 1933, during the most acute phase of the Great Depression.

    its creditor institutions, now close to a climax. To avoid failure, concessions
    will be needed from both sides. From the EU, forbearance and finance to promote
    structural reform and economic recovery, and to preserve the integrity of the
    Eurozone. From Greece, credible commitment to show that, while it is against austerity,
    it is in favour of reform and wants to play a positive role in the EU.

    to distinguish austerity from reforms; to condemn austerity does not entail being
    anti-reform." Six months on, we are dismayed that austerity is undermining Syriza''s
    key reforms, on which EU leaders should surely have been collaborating with the
    Greek government: most notably to overcome tax evasion and corruption. Austerity
    drastically reduces revenue from tax reform, and restricts the space for change
    to make public administration accountable and socially efficient. And the constant
    concessions required by the government mean that Syriza is in danger of losing
    political support and thus its ability to carry out a reform programme that will
    bring Greece out of the crisis. It is wrong to ask Greece to commit itself to
    an old programme that has demonstrably failed, been rejected by Greek voters,
    and which large numbers of economists (including ourselves) believe was misguided
    from the start.'

    railway episode in the 1830s, but with the economy weak in the late 1830s and
    early 1840s, owing partly to the aftermath of the Panic of 1837, the spark did
    not catch. By 1843, however, the economy was recovering, interest rates were low,
    railroad construction costs were falling, and railway revenues were rising, thus
    setting the stage for a full-blown manic episode.

    a larger new cohort of eager investors wanting in on the action. With investors
    crowding, the number of railroad securities listed on the London exchange—and

    rates, and as credit tightened, railroad share prices began a long, steep decline,

    Crisis of 1847 was the shock to the agricultural sector and the subsequent financial
    and monetary fallout (Dornbusch and Frenkel). Both Ireland and England suffered
    massive harvest failures in 1846, which led to food shortages and drove up commodity
    prices. As food imports from the United States and elsewhere surged, the British
    trade deficit turned sharply more negative (doubling in absolute terms between
    1845 and 1847) and gold bullion reserves drained from the Bank of England to finance
    food imports. In April, to hoard its dwindling reserves, the Bank raised the discount
    rate and severely limited the bills it would discount (lend against), causing,
    as C.N. Ward-Perkins (p.78) mildly put it, “much complaint in financial and commercial
    circles.”

- en: Aggravating the tightening monetary conditions was a rash of failures of “commercial”
    firms occasioned by failed speculative plays (via derivatives!) in foodstuffs,
    particularly corn. With the failed 1846 harvest as prologue, many merchant houses
    bought corn and other foodstuffs forward, expecting higher prices in the future.
    By the time these contracts matured in mid-1847, prospects for a strong harvest
    that summer caused spot prices to fall sharply, catching many speculators short.
    Further, the Bank of England raised rates again in August, and the confluence
    of falling prices and higher rates led to widespread financial panic that brought
    down more than fifty corn merchants in August and September, along with many of
    the commercial firms that funded their positions. The deflating railway bubble,
    which bankrupted many enterprises and raised doubts about the stability of the
    financial system, set the stage for the panic (Dornbusch and Frenkel).

    resort was severely constrained by the Bank Charter Act of 1844 (Humphrey and
    Keleher). The Act gave the Bank of England a monopoly on new note (essentially
    money) issuance but required that all new notes be backed by gold or government
    debt.*** The intent, per Currency School doctrine, was to prevent financial crises
    and inflation by inhibiting currency creation. Adherents recognized that the Act
    might also limit the central bank’s discretion to manage crises, but they argued
    that limiting currency creation would prevent financial crises in the first place,
    thus obviating the need for a lender of last resort. But, of course, not all crises
    originate in the financial sector. In the case of the Commercial Crisis, the perverse
    effect of the Act was to cause the Bank to tighten monetary conditions in both
    April and October as gold reserves drained from the Bank (Dornbusch and Frenkel).
    In July, a coalition of merchants, bankers, and traders issued a letter against
    the Bank Charter Act, blaming it for “an extent of monetary pressure, such as
    is without precedent” (Gregory 1929, quoted in Dornbusch and Frenkel).'

    pounds in reserve, down from eight million in January. Systemic collapse seemed
    imminent. On Saturday of that week, London bankers petitioned Parliament to suspend
    the Bank Act, and by midday Monday it had done so, thus enabling the Bank to issue
    new notes without gold backing and to “enlarge the amount of their discounts and
    advances upon approved security”(J. Russell and Charles Wood, Bank of England).
    ***The ability to expand fiat note issuance increased liquidity and helped the
    Bank restore confidence, and the seven percent discount rate the Bank was charging
    attracted gold reserves back to its vaults (hence the maxim “seven percent will
    draw gold from the moon”). By December, interest rates were down substantially
    from their panic levels.***'
