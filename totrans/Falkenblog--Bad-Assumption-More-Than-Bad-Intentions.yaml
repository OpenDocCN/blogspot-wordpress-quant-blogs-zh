    with hindsight, and there is little one can learn from that diagnosis because
    I doubt hubris, ignorance, and short-sightedness are in any company''s mission
    statement. Many commentators note that there was significant ''moral hazard''
    caused by short term bonuses, as basically bankers were putting on trades that
    had zero or negative net present value, but paid a positive return over long periods.
    Think of a high yield bond that pays +1, +1, +1, +1, +1, -5\. If you get in on
    that early, and lever up, by the time it tanks you have banked several healthy
    bonuses and shareholders and taxpayers are on the hook.'

  zh: ，前投资银行家，写了《纸牌屋》。他似乎把这归咎于傲慢、不了解风险、承担过多风险。这些都是真实的，但这是事后看来的，从这个诊断中几乎没有什么可以学到，因为我怀疑傲慢、无知和短视并不在任何公司的使命宣言中。许多评论员指出，短期奖金导致了显著的“道德风险”，因为基本上银行家们进行的交易在整个周期内的现值为零或为负，但在长期内却有正回报。想象一下一只高收益债券，它支付+1，+1，+1，+1，+1，-5。如果你早早地介入，并且杠杆起来，那么当它崩盘时，你已经获得了几个丰厚的奖金，而股东和纳税人则陷入困境。
- en: The problem with this line of thinking is that I have worked in banks and hedge
    funds, and never have I known those making the ultimate decision to ignore the
    over-the-cycle present value. They are often wrong, but even if a lower-level
    guy is trying to game the system this way, when the strategy or trade is pitched
    and discussed, it is over the cycle. When every bank is in on the same trade,
    it's not like everyone is being duped, rather, its a really subtle, powerful intellectual
    error. Some people were cynical opportunists--those pushing NINJA loans, turning
    the knob to 11--but generally I think people were just sincerely incorrect.

  zh: 这种思维方式的问题在于，我曾在银行和对冲基金工作过，从来没有见过那些做出最终决定的人忽视了整个周期的现值。他们经常是错误的，但即使一个低级别的人试图以这种方式操纵系统，当战略或交易被提出和讨论时，它是基于整个周期的。当每家银行都在同一交易中参与时，这不像是每个人都被愚弄了，而是一个非常微妙、强大的智力错误。有些人是愤世嫉俗的机会主义者——那些推动NINJA贷款，把旋钮拧到11的人——但总的来说，我认为人们只是真诚地错误了。

  zh: 主持的 bloggingheads 节目，关注弗雷迪·麦克和房利美，他们在2007年之前从未写过有关信用风险的文章，监管机构也没有发放过大额奖金。此外，大多数投资银行都承担了大量AAA评级部分的风险，所以他们不是在玩卖给他们的部分——他们相信了这一点。这不是恶意，而是一个诚实的错误，几乎似乎每个人都受到了影响。

    rocks fall because they are like cartoons where everything is alive and has intentions.
    Unfortunately, bad things are usually the result of ignorance, though with hindsight
    every bubble has hubris almost by definition.
