    on hubris, not understanding risk, taking too much risk. All true, but that''s
    with hindsight, and there is little one can learn from that diagnosis because
    I doubt hubris, ignorance, and short-sightedness are in any company''s mission
    statement. Many commentators note that there was significant ''moral hazard''
    caused by short term bonuses, as basically bankers were putting on trades that
    had zero or negative net present value, but paid a positive return over long periods.
    Think of a high yield bond that pays +1, +1, +1, +1, +1, -5\. If you get in on
    that early, and lever up, by the time it tanks you have banked several healthy
    bonuses and shareholders and taxpayers are on the hook.'

    funds, and never have I known those making the ultimate decision to ignore the
    over-the-cycle present value. They are often wrong, but even if a lower-level
    guy is trying to game the system this way, when the strategy or trade is pitched
    and discussed, it is over the cycle. When every bank is in on the same trade,
    it's not like everyone is being duped, rather, its a really subtle, powerful intellectual
    error. Some people were cynical opportunists--those pushing NINJA loans, turning
    the knob to 11--but generally I think people were just sincerely incorrect.

    to 2007, and regulators had no big bonuses. Further, most of the investment banks
    retained significant exposure to the AAA rated pieces, so they weren't playing
    those they sold to--they believed it. It wasn't bad intentions, it was an honest
    error that seemed to hit almost everyone.

    rocks fall because they are like cartoons where everything is alive and has intentions.
    Unfortunately, bad things are usually the result of ignorance, though with hindsight
    every bubble has hubris almost by definition.
