# Falkenblog: Don't Panic, Inflation will Save Us

It is strange how many people I have heard say: "we should inflate as much as possible, worry about it later". Remember the poor Ukrainian peasants in 1918, saying 'what could be worse than the Czar?' Things can always get worse. As if the problems caused by an inflationary spiral are not bad. Clearly, it would solve the indebtedness issue. Yet, the inflationary decades are hardly ones of great economic times, and end with a nasty recessions.

M1 Growth 13 months after onset of last 8 recessions:

| Recession Start | M1 Growth |
| Apr-60 | 2.4% |
| Dec-69 | 6.6% |
| Nov-73 | 4.9% |
| Jan-80 | 8.6% |
| Jul-81 | 7.0% |
| Jul-90 | 7.4% |
| Mar-01 | 7.1% |
| Dec-07 | 15.4% |

So, Bernanke is trying. Unfortunately, its not working yet. But, when I was a freshman and we would drink grain alcohol until we felt it, that never ended well.
