- en: The SPX has been on an upper Bollinger Band (BB) ride on the weekly chart, and
    I have been waiting for a downside break on the weekly RSI-14 indicator as the
    signal that a correction is starting. Current readings show that the weekly RSI
    has not broken down below 70 tet.

    down below 70, which is a short-term sell signal. RSI-14 has also followed suit,
    which is another bearish sign. The index also experienced a bearish engulfing
    pattern on Monday, which is potentially ominous.
