- en: The article is much more interesting that the title might suggest and discusses
    a 'theory' that short-term interest rates precede volatility by 2 1/2 years. While
    this sounds like a stretch to me, if you believe the theory, then the VIX should
    be topping in early 2009 -- which just happens to be about the time suggested
    by some of my [VIX macro cycle](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20macro%20cycles)
    work. Certainly worth a click through for the curious...
