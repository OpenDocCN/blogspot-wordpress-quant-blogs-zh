    hegde funds. The capital is seeking returns, of course. The traders are seeking
    compensation too, as well as freedom from the corporate culture of the big trading
    banks. And the techies are fleeing the sometimes stifling technical culture of
    the big banks, with onerous change management and architectural standards. Naturally,
    the techies are chasing big bonuses too.

    he hit the jackpot big time with Viaweb. I’ve worked for small, large and medium
    sized companies. My experience suggests that PG over emphasizes the freedom of
    start up environments. When I’m struggling against the inevitable bureaucracy
    of a large organisation, small companies can seem like highly liberated environments.
    But it’s important to remember that in a small company, you have to do a bit of
    everything: sales, admin, marketing. In a large org, there are people to take
    care of that, so you can specialize. If you get the right role, you become free
    to concentrate on the good stuff, to concentrate on what you do well and what
    you enjoy.'

    many ways that was the perfect environment. The company was large enough to support
    specialisation, but still small enough to avoid bureaucracy and a process centric
    approach. Still small enough that everyone knew everyone else.
