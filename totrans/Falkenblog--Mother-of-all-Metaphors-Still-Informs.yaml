    introducing new laws.

    priorities of the Fed, OCC, SEC, FDIC, or other existing regulatory bodies, the
    focus instead was on creating a new regulatory agency, the Consumer Financial
    Protection Bureau. Debates about regulations invariably center on more or less,

    limits and guidelines with prudence. It's hard to see how one can really have
    confidence that this process really makes the system more robust.
