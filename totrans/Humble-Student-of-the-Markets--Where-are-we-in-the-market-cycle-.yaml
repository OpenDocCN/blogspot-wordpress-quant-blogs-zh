    cycle, they are not the same. Since Wall Street's attention span approximates
    that of a 16-year-old, it is not unusual at all to find several market cycles
    compressed within a single economic cycle.

    cycle is very different from others. The last bear market was not sparked by monetary
    tightening, but the exogenous effect of a pandemic. The market leaders of the
    2020 bear were not the usual defensive names. Instead, investors piled into work-from-home
    beneficiaries consisting mostly of Big Tech stocks.
