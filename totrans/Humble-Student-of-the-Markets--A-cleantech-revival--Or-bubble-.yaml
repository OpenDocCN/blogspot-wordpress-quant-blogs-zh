    alternative to petroleum-based energy sources.

    be grown relatively easily. Scalability and resource utilization is less of an
    issue when compared other biofuels. It can be relatively energy efficient.

    acre per day. Assuming that they put together a 10,000 acre facility, this amounts
    to 164K gallons per day. There are 42 gallons in a barrel, but a barrel of oil
    produces about 23 gallons of gasoline. Using the 23 gal/bbl equivalent, a 10,000
    acre facility produces about 7K barrel gasoline-equivalent from this technology.

    It’s what quants call epsilon, the miniscule error term that appears at the end

    acres, which is roughly the size of the State of Maine, and they had sufficient
    access to seawater, this would amount to about 360K of barrel equivalent of oil
    production per day. While that represents a very large find (let’s remember that
    we are taking up Maine), it is still a blip in oil production. Saudi Arabia, by
    contrast, can produce about 10-11 million barrels a day.

    and technology problems were solved, you need to use this technology on an area
    30 times the size of Maine to replace Saudi Arabia.
