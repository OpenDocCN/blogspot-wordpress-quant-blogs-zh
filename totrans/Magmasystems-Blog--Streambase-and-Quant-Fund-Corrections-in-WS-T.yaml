    diligence and subsequent corrections on their article about PhaseCapital's evaluation
    process in which they chose Streambase. The link is

- en: Last summer, the quant fund began evaluating major complex event processing
    venders by attending trade shows, checking general market acceptance and investigating
    research on CEP. "We don't claim we've seen every CEP vendor," Goodell notes.
    During the fall, the firm drilled down on CEP vendors by meeting with representatives,
    checking product references (blind and vendor provided), downloading publicly
    available products, and reading white papers. "Some products appeared to be more
    flexible than others, and that was a large part of our evaluation process," Goodell
    notes. "While we wanted to make sure the product would integrate well with our
    environment and that it was rich enough to allow us the control we needed to implement
    our algorithms, we also wanted to make sure it was enough of a high-level platform
    that we did not need to worry about data management issues."

    questionable assertions from PhaseCapital and Streambase in their original article.
