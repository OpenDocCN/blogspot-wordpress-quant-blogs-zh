# Magmasystems Blog: RIP: Doug Walker (Alien Planetscapes)

Doug Walker, long-time mainstay of the New York Spacerock scene and founder of the band Alien Planetscapes, passed away Tuesday April 4th at home. Doug had a heart condition for several years, and it finally caught up to him.

Doug was one of my oldest friends. I met Doug in 1975, and played in several seminal free-jazz bands with him in the mid to late 70's, including the great Third Sun.

Doug lost his wife Fran 2 years ago in a horrific car crash.

Doug leaves behind his son Evan, who was born three weeks after my own son.

God Bless You, Doug. Now you can jam with Robert Moog.
