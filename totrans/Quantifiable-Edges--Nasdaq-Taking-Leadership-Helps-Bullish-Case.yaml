    weeks out. Last week I noticed the Nasdaq was trying to take the lead back from
    the NYSE. When the market closed for the week the Nasdaq did manage to barely
    overtake the NYSE based on

    in light of my study of a few weeks ago. I’ve updated the chart from a few weeks
    ago below. The red line has now barely crossed the yellow line signifying the
    Nasdaq’s RS is slightly stronger.

- en: I ran a few studies to determine the possible significance of the Nasdaq taking
    the lead. The first one simply looked to buy any time the Nasdaq went from “lagging”
    to “leading”. On the chart above this would be shown by the red line crossing
    above the yellow line. The results are below.

    situations like the present where the Nasdaq rebounded from an extreme lagging
    position as described in the previous study and then crossed over to take the
    lead. There were 15 such occurrences. The performance of the NYSE from 1-10 weeks
    out can be found in the table below.

    Rather than exiting “X” weeks later, I said to exit whenever the red line re-crossed
    below the yellow, which would represent the Nasdaq falling back to a lagging position.

    crossed back below the NYSE would have produced 11 winning trades and 4 losers.
    The average winning trade was good for more than 5% and the average loser saw
    a decline of less than 1.2%. The length of the average winner was 7 weeks vs.
    5 weeks for a loser. If $100,000 was allocated to each trade (assuming no commissions
    or slippage) the gross profits on winning trades would have been $50,901.45 versus
    gross losses of $4,617.18 for the losing trades. This equates to an outstanding
    profit factor (gross gains / gross losses) of 12.02.

    argument for the bullish case.
