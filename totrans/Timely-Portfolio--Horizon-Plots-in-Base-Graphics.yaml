    and each have their zealots.  Last time in [More on Horizon Charts](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2012/08/more-on-horizon-charts.html),
    I used lattice and latticeExtra. This time we will build horizon plots in base
    graphics, and I was pleased with the result. ~~Unfortunately, there is one small
    issue in that the points of change from positive to negative overlap.  Please
    let me know if you have a solution.~~ *Thanks to helpful readers for their comments
    and code changes, this is now fixed.*

    type now to other packages.  Here is a potential example using quantmod.
