- en: After many requests to provide more details about my thinking vis-à-vis the
    markets in general and individual stocks in particular, I am preparing to launch
    a subscriber newsletter. Given the recent market turmoil and the considerable
    uncertainty about the path forward, this seems like as good a time as any to take
    this step.

- en: Targeting many subject areas covered by the blog, the newsletter will focus
    more on market sentiment analysis and technical analysis than on broad macroeconomic
    issues and stock fundamentals. In truth, my investing approach includes all four
    elements, but I think the macroeconomic and fundamental aspects of the market
    are covered quite thoroughly already, whereas good information on TA and particularly
    market sentiment tend to be much more difficult to find.

    to watch for in the coming week. I will include my outlook on a variety of asset
    classes as well as purchases and sales in three different model portfolios.

    target sectors and industries, market sentiment, charts of interest, and reader
    questions.

    here, but it would be safe to say that I intend to save some of what I consider
    to be my best thinking for the subscriber newsletter.
