# DVO Now Available | CSSA

> 来源：[https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2009/11/23/dvo-now-available/#0001-01-01](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2009/11/23/dvo-now-available/#0001-01-01)

The DVO which stands for the DV Oscillator is the mother indicator of the DV2 and DVSC. The DVO did nearly 40% CAGR on the SPY over the last 12 years just using a simple baseline strategy of entering below 50 and exiting above 50.  It is much more adaptive than  DV2 or DVSC and the frequency of the oscillator swings are less sensitive to regime changes. The average gains per trade are much higher with the DVO than the DV2 or the DVSC . It is available now at [www.dvindicators.com](http://www.dvindicators.com)
