    continued to top the *VIX and More* weekly [fear poll](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Fear%20poll),
    while investor anxiety regarding weak earnings, Israel and [China](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/China)

    is a growing trend toward the mistrust of the role of institutions such as central
    banks and governments in economic matters. Concerns about central bankers and
    politicians are significant enough to poll in the #3 and #4 spots for all respondents,
    but rate even higher in the U.S., where government and politicians were the #2
    concern and excessive central bank intervention worries garnered the #3 spot.'

    (still polling in the #2 slot on a global basis) to be situations that have been
    caused by and/or exacerbated by central banks, governments and politicians, then

    of abating. This week, for example, 12.4% more of the U.S. respondents cited the
    fiscal cliff as the top concern over the European sovereign debt crisis. For non-U.S.
    respondents, however, the fiscal cliff outpolled the European sovereign debt crisis
    by only 2.8%.
