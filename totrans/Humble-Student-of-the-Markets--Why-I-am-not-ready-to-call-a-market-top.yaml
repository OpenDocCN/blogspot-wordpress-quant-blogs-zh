    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    signal. A bullish Trend Model signal that gets less bullish is a trading "sell"
    signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading
    "buy" signal. The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of
    the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. The turnover rate
    of the trading model is high, and it has varied between 150% to 200% per month.

    traders in my social media feed have become increasingly nervous and bearish.
    The bull can point to the SPX repeatedly testing its 200 day moving average (dma),
    which has held as technical support. However, the market's inability to rally
    despite what has been good earnings news during a Q1 earnings season with solid
    results is worrisome.

    as the macro backdrop reveals that no pre-conditions of a bear market are in sight.
    While there are concerns that the American economy is undergoing the late cycle
    phase of an expansion, which is typically followed by a bear phase. I am not ready
    to make the investment call that stock prices have topped out just yet.

    of depicting the changes in leadership in different groups, such as sectors, countries
    and regions, and market factors. The charts are organized into four quadrants.
    An idealized group rotation pattern occurs in a clockwise fashion. Leading groups
    (top right) deteriorate to weakening groups (bottom right), which then rotates
    to lagging groups (bottom left), which changes to improving groups (top left),
    and finally completes the cycle by improving to leading groups (top right) again.

    late cycle inflation sectors (gold and oil), which is the result of late cycle
    inflationary pressures, along with interest sensitive sectors (REITs and utilities)
    as the result of a dovish Fed.
