    with a number of readers, gold. In particular, gold is important in a market cycle
    analytical framework. That's because inflation hedge leadership tends to mark
    the terminal phase of equity bull cycle.

    shows, gold violated its 50 and 200 day moving averages (dma) and it is now testing
    an uptrend line. Further weakness would be bad news for the bulls.

    correlated with real interest rates (red line, inverted scale). Gold is an inflation
    hedge, and rising real interest rates would tend to depress the price of gold.

    and debate the likely path of inflation and interest rates, an analysis of the
    technical conditions of other inflation hedge vehicles such as energy and mining
    represents a more pragmatic approach to the problem.
