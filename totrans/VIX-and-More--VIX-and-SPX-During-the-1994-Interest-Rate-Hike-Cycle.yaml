    post in the books, it occurred to me that my reference to the series of interest
    rate hikes in [1994](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/1994) probably
    stretches back before the memory banks of the current generation of investors.
    So with all the anxiety about Fed tapering and ultimately ending quantitative
    easing, I thought this might be a good time to review what happened to stocks
    and volatility when the Fed embarked upon a series of interest rate hikes that
    took the financial community by surprise.

  zh: 在昨天的[《VIX和FOMC前后交易》](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2013/06/the-vix-and-pre-fomc-post-fomc-trades.html)文章发布后，我意识到我提到的[1994年的一系列加息](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/1994)可能会超出当前一代投资者的记忆范围。因此，在所有关于美联储削减购买量和最终结束定量宽松的焦虑之中，我认为现在是回顾当美联储意外采取一系列加息行动时股票和波动率的表现的好时机。
- en: To set the context, the 1990s started out with a recession that coincided with
    the first Gulf War and a corresponding sharp rise in oil prices. The Fed had been
    gradually lowering interest rates from 1989 – 1992 and this helped to create an
    environment that favored a recovery, but this recovery took some time to gain
    traction and did not get going until 1991\. The stock market fared better than
    the economy during this period; after a down year in 1990, stocks rallied to post
    gains in 1991, 1992 and 1993\. After a strong January for stocks, 1994 appeared
    to be on a similar path to success.

  zh: 要设置上下文，90年代始于与第一次海湾战争同时发生的衰退，伴随着油价的急剧上涨。美联储从1989年到1992年逐渐降低了利率，这有助于创造一个有利于复苏的环境，但这种复苏需要一些时间才能获得动力，并且直到1991年才开始。股市在这段时间内表现比经济好；在1990年的下跌之后，股票在1991年、1992年和1993年实现了涨幅。经过一个对股市有利的一月份，1994年似乎也在走向成功的道路上。
- en: It was at this point that Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan decided to
    remove the proverbial punch bowl before the party got out of hand and on February
    4, 1994, the Fed surprised the markets by announcing a 0.25% increase in the federal
    funds rate. By the time 1994 was over, the Fed had raised interest rates on six
    different occasions. As the chart below shows, the first three raises were 0.25%
    increases in the federal funds rate, but the incremental size of the raises increased
    to 0.50% and eventually 0.75% later in the year and were supplemented by increases
    in the federal discount rate, which also grew from 0.50% to 0.75%. By the time
    1994 was in the books, the federal funds rate had jumped from 3.00% to 5.50% and
    the federal discount rate had risen from 3.00% to 4.75%. (The rate hike cycle
    finally ended on February 1, 1995, when the Fed raised the federal funds rate
    to 6.00% and the federal discount rate to 5.25%.)

  zh: 正是在这个时候，美联储主席艾伦·格林斯潘决定在派对失控之前拿走这个俗语中的酒碗，于1994年2月4日，美联储宣布将联邦基金利率上调0.25％，令市场感到意外。到1994年结束时，美联储已经六次提高了利率。如下图所示，头三次的加息都是联邦基金利率上调0.25％，但后来加息的幅度增加到了0.50％，最终在年底增加到了0.75％，同时还伴随着联邦贴现率的提高，该比率也从0.50％提高到了0.75％。到1994年结束时，联邦基金利率已经从3.00％上升到5.50％，联邦贴现率已经从3.00％上升到4.75％。（加息周期最终于1995年2月1日结束，当时美联储将联邦基金利率上调至6.00％，联邦贴现率上调至5.25％。）
- en: Keep in mind that Alan Greenspan did not believe in signaling the Fed’s intentions
    in those days; on the contrary, he was a master of obfuscation and his cryptic
    and often ambiguous language typically kept investors in the dark about his intentions.
    For this reason, it was difficult for the markets to anticipate the Fed’s next
    move and investors we not necessarily prepared for subsequent interest rate hikes.

  zh: 请记住，艾伦·格林斯潘在那些日子里并不相信暗示美联储的意图；相反，他是一个模糊其辞的大师，他常常含糊其辞的语言通常让投资者对他的意图一无所知。因此，市场很难预测美联储的下一步行动，投资者也未必为随后的加息做好准备。
- en: How did the financial markets respond to what amounted to almost a doubling
    of the federal funds rate and an increase of more than 50% in the federal discount
    rate? With a lot less volatility than one might imagine. The average closing value
    of the VIX was 13.93 in 1994, little different than the 13.90 average for the
    VIX in 2013\. While the VIX did spike all the way up to 28.30 on April 4^(th),
    the VIX only closed above 20.00 on two days during the entire year! The S&P 500
    index ended the year with a small loss (a small gain if dividends were to be included
    in the calculations), but roared back with gains of 34%, 20%, 31%, 27% and 20%
    in the subsequent five years.

  zh: 金融市场如何应对实际上相当于联邦基金利率翻倍和联邦贴现率增加超过50%的情况呢？与人们可能想象的波动要小得多。1994年VIX的平均收盘值为13.93，与2013年的13.90相差不大。虽然VIX在4月4日曾一度飙升至28.30，但整整一年只有两天VIX收盘价超过20.00！标普500指数年底以微小的亏损收官（如果将股息计入计算，则会有微小的收益），但在随后的五年中，以34%、20%、31%、27%和20%的涨幅回归。

    article in the Financial Times yesterday (and his subsequent tweet, “The Fed does
    not leak anything to any journalist to steer markets - especially during blackout”)
    may have given investors an opportunity for a dress rehearsal for the ultimate
    tapering, the historical record from 1994 suggests that tapering fears may be
    exaggerating how the QE end game will ultimately play out.

    - 尤其是在封锁期间”）也许给了投资者一个练习最终缩减的机会，但1994年的历史记录表明，缩减的担忧可能夸大了量化宽松的最终局面。
