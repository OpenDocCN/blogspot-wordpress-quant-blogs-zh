    revealed some very interesting changes.  Since the Korean Won is so undervalued
    versus the Japanese Yen on a Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) basis, I was very interested
    in how this undervaluation might have affected Japanese and Korean trade between
    themselves and with the United States.  The 2008-2009 financial crisis ended the
    growing Japanese surplus with Korea, and currently the Japanese surplus with Korea
    is at its lowest level since January 2003.

    can see Korea has maintained the level of surplus achieved prior to the 2008-2009
    financial crisis, while the Japanese surplus has eroded rapidly over that same
    time frame.

    their recent market share gains?  If the Korean Won appreciates versus the Yen,
    will there be any impact on the US $?  If there is unexpected inflation, will
    this exacerbate the Korean Won appreciation?
