    weekly close in 3 ½ months.  Looking back two weeks, the VIX has now risen a cumulative
    2.29 points or 16.4%, with the VWSI holding steady at zero at the end of each
    week.

    appear to agree with the assessment of the VWSI, as futures from July ’07 to June
    ’08 are all bunched tightly in the 16.16 to 16.41 range.
