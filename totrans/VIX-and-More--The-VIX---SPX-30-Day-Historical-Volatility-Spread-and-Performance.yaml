    I used a [chart](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/10/vix-in-context-of-historical-volatility.html)
    to demonstrate how the VIX (which is essentially the [implied volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/implied%20volatility)
    of the SPX) compares across various SPX [historical volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/historical%20volatility)
    lookback time frames.

    in the 19 year history of the VIX, four of the eight largest negative divergences
    between the VIX and the SPX 30 day historical volatility have occurred in the
    past two weeks (the other four were from August 2002). Looking back at the history
    of these negative divergences, they have regularly occurred just before substantially
    below average market performance. The 14 instances in which the VIX was at least
    10 points below the 30 day historical volatility of the SPX, for instance, resulted
    in an average loss of 8.6% in the next 20 days. The 76 instances in which the
    VIX was at least 5 points below the 30 day HV of the SPX produced an average return
    of -1.2% in the next 20 days.

    instances in which the VIX was at least 15 points higher than the 30 day HV of
    the SPX led to a 6.6% return over the course of the next 20 days. For 67 instances
    in which the VIX was 12.5 points higher than the SPX’s 30 day HV, the 20 day return
    was 4.5%.

    that on October 10^(th), the spread between the VIX and the 30 day HV of the SPX
    was 16.2 (and the SPX jumped 11.6% the next day.) Friday marks the 20^(th) trading
    day since this signal. Is it possible that the [VIX spread](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20spread)
    will begin to create a strong downward pull on the markets by the end of the week?
