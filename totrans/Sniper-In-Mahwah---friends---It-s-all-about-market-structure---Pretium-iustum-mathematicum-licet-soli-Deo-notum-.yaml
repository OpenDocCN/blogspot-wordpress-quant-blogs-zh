    later, but as always I’m late. Whatever… For human beings microseconds, nanoseconds,
    or attoseconds, are of no importance. I even forgot to write a short blog post
    to announce that my new book on high-frequency trading , “4“, dedicated to the
    recent radio/wireless networks built for HFTs (a extended version of the now-famous
    [*HFT in my backyard*](https://sniperinmahwah.wordpress.com/2014/09/22/hft-in-my-backyard-part-i/)
    series I wrote here), was released in January, but I assume most of the readers
    of this blog follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SniperInMahwah). Anyway,
    I was quite busy with the book launch (which is quite impressive, more than expected—check
    out some of the press reviews compiled [here](https://quantreg.com/2019/02/21/4-by-alexandre-laumonier-reviews/),
    thanks Marcos for that), interviews, a film shooting for German/French TV Arte
    (about HFT), etc., and above all my own business (a [book company](http://www.zones-sensibles.org/news/))
    I have to run (success is nice, but time-consuming). I wanted to write a post
    about my previous books on HFT, and why I’m trying to work on/understand the small
    world of HFT and market microstructure, but that will come later.

    Belgian magazine, *[Wilfried](http://wilfriedmag.be)*, released a new issue yesterday
    where you can find (in French) the first 15 pages of my new book (slightly remixed),
    adorned with very nice photographies made by a talented photograph who took a
    drone in this very special area I talk about here (for those who read this blog,
    it’s the area around the radio tower in Houtem purchased by a HFT firm from Chicago
    in December 2012—this area is named “Les Moëres“, which is also the title of the
    first chapter of the book); 2/ as I’m discussing with anglophone publishers about
    the English translation of this book (seems a lot of people want to read it),
    I commissioned a translation of these first pages, so that the American/English
    publishers can “preview“ the book. I do not see why I could not share this translation
    with the readers of this blog and my lovely Twitter followers. So, here is an
    English version of the beginning of “4”. Thanks a lot to my translator, [Daniel
    Levin Becker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Levin_Becker), and to [Jelle
    Vermeersch](http://www.jellevermeersch.be), the photographer who shoot Les Moëres
    for *Wilfried*, who allows me to reproduce here some of very nice pictures he
    took (click to enlarge them). There are no photos in the original French version
    of the book, except the black and white one, but I think that for this online
    version some historical documents are interesting, besides Jelle’s photos (if
    you like polders and read French, check out Belgian writer [Chris de Stoop](http://www.chrisdestoop.be)’s

    The auctioneer verified that the participants had duly supplied their 1,000-euro
    registration fees, ensured that they all had in their possession the administrative
    documentation concerning the property—including the cadastral survey, on which
    the military property appeared in the shape of a cross—and then set the bid increment

    Ministry of Defence (which had secretly concluded that it would make out handsomely
    on anything over 400,000 euros) but destabilized the auctioneer. He decided to
    raise the bid increment to 10,000 euros in order to accelerate the sale, after
    which the highest bid quickly reached 1 million euros, then 1.1 million euros,
    1.2 million euros, 1.3 million euros, 1.4 million euros… By 2 million, one hour
    later, the increasingly sweaty auctioneer called a recess and took refuge in the
    restroom to compose himself. History gives no record of what went through his
    thoughts as he looked at the bewildered face in the mirror. “On the sellers’ side,
    nobody had any idea what was happening,” recalls a witness, himself all the more

    Under gray skies, they traveled by car to Houtem, 9 kilometers from the dunes
    of the North Sea and 400 meters from the Franco-Belgian border, in the region
    of Les Moëres. A fanciful etymology traces the word *Moëres *back to “Morini,”
    the name of the descendants of the ancient Celtic tribes who had lived there in
    palafittes, wooden houses on stilts that rested on stone mounds known as *pols*.
    These prehistoric lakeside cities were likely the first form of human habitation
    in a region whose subsequent history was marked by a long and unequal struggle
    against liquidity.

    source is in France, south of Saint-Omer), an immense gulf ranging from Calais
    to Nieuwpoort. Only a few islets of land emerged, on which the Morini set up their
    palafittes. When Caesar’s troops arrived in Morinia, the region was just a huge
    chain of putrid swamps, far from ideal for a military occupation. Nonetheless,
    according to his *Commentaries on the Gallic Wars*, Caesar had enormous difficulty
    getting the best of the Morini: “*Of all people, the Belgians are the bravest*,”
    he wrote, a formula the inhabitants of this flat country still like to quote to
    this day, even though in reality the word *brave*was meant to highlight the boorishness
    of the local “barbarians.” By dint of lengthy battles, the Romans finally subdued
    the Morini, but did not settle in this inhospitable region. They were more interested
    in the port of Boulogne-sur-Mer, farther south, from which they planned to invade
    England. It is also possible that they decided to keep the marshes intact since,
    when they were flooded by the sea (which occurred frequently), they formed a natural
    impregnable barrier, thus protecting the territory from regular incursion by the
    Saxons.'

    able to be cultivated, at least until the fourth century, when the Aa delta was
    entirely submerged following a brutal climate shift. The gulf then transformed
    into an immense sedimentary basin where peat and clay began to appear. When, a
    century later, the Roman Empire crumbled, a few missionaries attempted to Christianize
    Morinia, but without any real success. It would not be until the sixth century
    that the Christians finally occupied the muddy terrain in a sustainable way, beginning
    a slow and complex process of water control.

    from the abbey of Saint-Augustin-lès-Thérouanne, founded in 544 a few kilometers

    defined as a “land that has been subtracted from the impetuosity of the sea’s
    tides and floods, by man,” would automatically belong to the abbey. It is not
    insignificant that the Benedictines, who later colonized the north of France,
    came from the English region of the Fenlands, a swampy territory where the monks
    had tried various techniques for drying up the waters by draining the liquidity.
    Thanks to this expertise, the Aa delta began slowly to dry out, certain rivers
    were canalized, and the Neolithic *pols*turned into *polders*. But the bad weather
    and the floods came regularly to ruin the monks’ labor: sometimes entire regions,
    polderized and then cultivated, found themselves underwater in a single night.'

    such large quantities of water was punishing work – a bottomless pit. For that
    matter, since every *terra nova*, or *agri occupatorii*, became property of the
    monks, some of the region’s inhabitants were forced to continue living in landscapes
    saturated by pestilential water that sometimes caused lethal epidemics of malaria
    or fever. Outside of the zones controlled by the Benedictines, and then by the
    Cistercians, each community did what it could to make the water the neighbors’
    problem, until finally, faced with disease, everyone decided to form artificial
    lowland lakes, far from residential areas, called “Moëres,” from the Dutch *moer*,
    or “marsh.” It was only with the accession of the House of Flanders in the tenth
    century that the anarchic management of the lands’ drainage came to an end. In
    the twelfth century, Philip of Alsace decided to dry the entirety of the coast,
    from Calais to Nieuwpoort, which was then divided into four sections called *wateringues*.
    This titanic construction still did not entirely meet its objectives: floods,
    spring tides, tempests, epidemics, military conflicts, and famines undermined
    the enterprise. Nature was a hostile ground, something to be ceaselessly fought

    in 1107, Benedictine and then Cistercian, situated a few kilometers to the north
    of the marshes, nonetheless had its hour of glory, financially and intellectually,
    in the thirteenth century. It boasted a vast domain of several thousand hectares,
    all along the coast from Dunkirk to the Netherlands, which saw the construction
    of numerous barns and other outbuildings. But the Cistercians were hardly worried
    about Les Moëres, which nonetheless counted among their possessions at the time.
    They simply built a farm, the Groot Moerhof, on a spit of land that cut into the
    marsh, the highest point in the region, in order to exploit the peat that had
    formed around the swampy lake when the Quaternary forests were submerged by water
    in the fourth century. In reality, this exploitation only made the situation worse:
    extracting the peat required the extension of the marsh, and the water became
    more and more invasive, reducing the surrounding cultivatable surface area accordingly.'

    Abbey of the Dunes also had to pit itself against nature to survive: in addition
    to the Hundred Years War and assaults from the Calvinists, it was beset by extremely
    frequent floods which gradually took over the occupied lands, diminishing the
    monks’ financial revenues. The Cistercians became scarcer and scarcer, and only
    about twenty of them still occupied the Abbey when the Protestants finally burned
    it down in 1578\. Unable to continue funding the maintenance required to reinforce
    the dikes separating them from the sea, the monks were ultimately overtaken by
    the sands. The few who remained in the community took refuge in one of the monastic
    barns they owned, some kilometers from the silted-up abbey. The end of the Cistercian
    occupation of the grounds around Les Moëres once again aggravated the situation,
    the waters that had been drained by the monks once again flowing into the interior

    to the colossal works of a remarkable painter, architect, engineer, and economist.
    Born in 1550 in Antwerp, [Wenceslas Cobergher](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wenceslas_Cobergher)
    spent the first half of his life in Italy, until Albert and Isabella of Austria,
    who ruled the Southern Netherlands, arranged for his return to Brussels around
    1604\. Named lead engineer by the archdukes, he built several churches and painted
    some canvases in and around Brussels, and also occupied himself with “economics.”
    He was responsible for the first mount of piety in this part of Europe, which
    opened in Brussels in 1618 at the behest of Albert and Isabella, a project he
    defended in a text in verse entitled [*Apologia ofte Bescherm-redenen tegen het
    kekelen van de onredelijcke vyanden, ende oock de tegenraeders, van de Berghen
    van*](https://books.google.be/books?id=NPhGAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q&f=false)
    *[Bermherticheyt](https://books.google.be/books?id=NPhGAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q&f=false) *(“Apology
    or defense against criticism by the unreasonable enemies and adversaries of the
    Mounts of Piety”). Mounts of piety had been created by Italian Franciscans in
    the second half of the fifteenth century to combat the abusive practices of Lombard
    usurers and Jewish bankers, who lent money at an interest rate of 30 to 40 percent,
    whereas mounts of piety, semi-public institutions, charged only 15 percent. Cobergher
    went on to create more than a dozen mounts of piety in the Netherlands but, like
    the archdukes, had to face opposition from Lombard lenders, who were defended
    by certain theologians, and from the authorities of the city of Brussels, who
    did not look too kindly on the fiscal privileges accorded these new mounts of
    piety and those who worked in them. The “industrious Cobergher” nonetheless received
    considerable support from the Jesuit [Leonardus Lessius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardus_Lessius),
    an eminent but unfairly unrecognized thinker of modern economics,^([2])who, in
    his monumental treatise *De iustitia et iure*, published in 1605, defended these
    public institutions: “*It is necessary to work hard and to do everything we can
    so that such mounts may be erected everywhere in our cities—after the suppression
    of usurers who exhaust the resources of people everywhere by dominating the market*.”
    For Lessius, who was not opposed to the market *per se*, “economic salvation”
    would come by way of, among others, these “mountains of money” which lent at reasonable
    rates and participated in a more equitable distribution of wealth. “*Bono publico
    nati sumus*,” the Jesuit affirmed: we are born for the public good. It was by
    respecting this precept to the letter that Cobergher, some years later, returned
    to his role as engineer to take on the simultaneously technical and economical
    project that was Les Moëres.'

    land rights; among other issues, the Cistercians of the Dunes, though silted in,
    invoked an old fishing right over a part of Les Moëres. Others came to claim parcels
    of land, but the archdukes decided unilaterally to appropriate the marsh and declare
    that three fifths of the future *terræ novæ *belonged to them (along with wind,
    water, and fishing rights), reserving the remaining two fifths for Cobergher to
    do with as he pleased. Cobergher the engineer remained faithful to Cobergher the
    economist, proving more charitable than the Cistercians: in order to keep rich
    entrepreneurs from coming to buy the lands once these had become fertile—as they
    promised to be—he ensured that those who worked for him on the drainage project
    would be exempted from taxes throughout the construction and for six months thereafter,
    a fiscal advantage that could potentially be renewed in such a way as to attract
    a population of poor workers who would then occupy these new lands.'

    lake, which formed an ellipse of 30 square kilometers. All along this dike, he
    had a canal dug 3 meters deep and 20 kilometers long: the Ringsloot, or “ring
    canal.” This Ringsloot then connected with another 10-kilometer canal (“Canal
    des Moëres”) that went as far as Dunkirk, where, at low tide, the water from Les
    Moëres could flow through a lock into the North Sea. After three years of colossal
    labor to complete this first phase, Cobergher turned to the most arduous task:
    extracting the water from the lake to transport it to the Ringsloot. Here he decided
    to use wind against water: he had 23 windmills constructed along the ring canal,
    each equipped with a vertical screw in the shape of a helix (known as an Archimedes’
    screw), so that the power of the wind could lift the water from Les Moëres. “*When
    these machines, which served at the same time to grind wheat, began to work and
    we saw torrents of water flowing into the Ringsloot, and at the same time the
    water level lowered in Les Moëres, and then toward the end of the year the land
    became visible in several places, there was general enthusiasm in the region*,”

    Les Moëres (to the south of the lake) could no longer evacuate their water properly.
    They brought the case to court but were quickly dismissed. Shortly thereafter,
    the recent polder was literally attacked by town counselors from the village of
    Veurne (to the north of the lake this time). With the agreement of the Abbey of
    the Dunes, which surely saw this as an opportunity for revenge, they broke a section
    of the dike surrounding the Ringsloot and stole the reeds that Cobergher’s workers
    had used to cover the mills. Between this tense climate and a wind so unfavorable
    that the mills remained immobile for at least six months, Cobergher could not
    finish his great project: stagnant water remained in the shallows of the marsh.
    The engineer, so as not to be “*hastened with wyfe and chylde toward his euident
    ruin*” when “*by industrie and extraordinary labour*” he “*hath surmounted many
    difficulties at great personal expense and risk to his lyfe*,” requested an extension

    was no more liquidity in Les Moëres. To do away with the last of the moisture,

    “agricultural racks” measuring 220 × 109 meters, sanitized by underground ceramic
    drains and surrounded by secondary channels leading the water from the shallows
    toward the Ringsloot. Rapeseed began growing all around the canals’ 28 kilometers.
    As planned, the engineer took possession of the space reserved for him but quickly
    sold his landed properties: Cobergher, decidedly more hospitable than the Cistercians,
    had also negotiated a certain number of “privileges” for those who bought these
    new lands, particularly a tax exemption and the assurance that no good would be
    consigned to military use. Moreover, since maintenance of the Ringsloot was essential
    to the continued drainage of Les Moëres—the residents’ life and work depended
    on it—he ensured that the villages were endowed with a communal administration
    whereby business could be managed collectively by the citizens.'

    came under siege. The Spanish who took over the city decided to close the locks
    and break down the canal dikes in order to create an aquatic line of defense,
    and Les Moëres was submerged in a night. All habitations and farms were destroyed.
    Only the church survived, its cross-capped bell tower emerging above the water,
    the only visible trace of a collective prosperity now disappeared. It would take
    two more centuries for the drainage of the lake to be complete once more. A more
    recent technology, the steam engine, allowed the windmills to remain active even
    without wind. These water pumps were then named after rivers (Po, Rhine, Danube,
    Tagus, Ganges, Seine…). The primal state of Les Moëres was wild, swampy, and foul.
    Its second state—dry, benevolent, molded over centuries by relentless human effort
    and engineering—attracted many farmers, often from far away. But the water would
    return: during World War I, the French, taking their cue from of the Spanish,
    flooded Les Moëres to prevent German troops from entering their territory through
    Belgium. Emboldened by this experience, the Germans anticipated this maneuver
    in World War II and flooded the polder themselves to slow the advance of French
    troops. The polder had become its own military apparatus—a liquid one.'

    Quarré-Reybourbon, “*but bit by bit a particular charm can be discerned in the
    landscape in spite of its monotony*.” When, on December 19, 2012, the potential
    buyers of the military property put up for sale by the Ministry of Defence arrived
    near the Franco-Belgian border, the sky was as gray as the land. The terrain of
    the quadrangular fields is made up of clay and muddy gray sands, the ground is
    carved into greenish rectilinear canals, and in winter, when the fields are bare,
    the whole thing melts into a single ash-colored horizon. Perfectly flat, the lands
    extend as far as the eye can see, their flatness reinforced by the altostratus
    clouds from the North Sea. It is a surprising atmosphere, arousing the strange
    feeling of being in a reticular nowhere from which possible horizons somehow radiate,
    one where time seems to stand still. The polder’s uniformity is reinforced by
    the grid of agricultural parcels, by the perfectly straight lines of the hydraulic
    network and of the paths—a model emblematic of that rectitude which some see as

    the Rhine. The northern section of the Ringsloot now joins another network, highway
    E40, which connects Veurne to Dunkirk. Coming from Belgium, exiting the highway,
    past a traffic circle where an enormous Archimedes’ screw was installed in 2017
    as a tribute to Cobergher (not far from a small [Pump Museum](http://minedhistoires.org/2012/04/16/letrange-musee-des-pompes-de-ghyvelde/),

    Moëres begins to spread out in silence the farther you get from the highway, a
    silence interrupted frequently by herons taking flight. At the end of this 5-kilometer
    straight line, after it has crossed the Ringsloot and left the “Path of the Octagon”
    on the right (where an electric water pump has since replaced the Ganges mill),
    is a field from which emanates a strange, undefinable sound: a continuous, almost
    electric vibration, a whistle distinct from the wind’s. You simply follow this
    unusual sound wave across the field to arrive at 1 rue du Héron, in the small
    village of Houtem, where you will find the former military property sold by the
    Ministry of Defence. With the exception of a small maintenance shed, the property
    is in reality just a straight line: a slender communication tower 243.5 meters
    high, whose verticality contrasts spectacularly with the horizontality of the
    landscape, a monolith of iron so thin that, during the day, it is often difficult
    to make out from a distance due to the often foggy local climate.'

    2 meters above sea level, stands up thanks to 48 guy-wires, taut cables between
    the tower and the eight anchor points solidly fixed in the middle of the field
    thanks to concrete stilts dug 15 meters deep, indispensable given the liquid nature
    of the ground. Thanks to the tension of the guy-wires, the 243.5 meters of the
    iron monolith—whose circular base, placed on a concrete block, measures only 20
    centimeters in diameter—rise delicately into the sky, an immense vertical line
    prolonging the horizontal lines of the polder, in a silence disturbed only by
    that singular electric vibration caused by the wind whispering against the guy-wires.

    Aeschylus described, as early as 458 B.C., in his tragedy *Agamemnon*, how a communication
    network was used to reveal the name of the victor in the Trojan War to the residents
    of Mycenae, four hundred kilometers as the crow flies from the battlefield, in
    a single night: “*From Ida’s top to Hephaestus, lord of fire, / Sent forth his
    sign; and on, and ever on, / Beacon to beacon sped the courier flame. / From Ida
    to the crag, that Hermes loves, / Of Lemnos; thence unto the steep sublime / Of
    Athos, throne of Zeus, the broad blaze flared. / Thence, raised aloft to shoot
    across the sea, / The moving light, rejoicing in its strength, / Sped from the
    pyre of pine, and urged its way, / In golden glory, like some strange new sun,
    / Onward, and reached Macistus’ watching heights*.”[3]The precision with which
    the locations are described makes it easy to [map](https://oklo.org/2014/11/28/optical-data-transmission/)
    this route, which used a simple flame-generated light signal—the equivalent of
    a bit, in the computing sense—on several hills from which the signal could be
    seen from afar (Mount Ida, Mount Athos, Mount Cithaeron, etc.), allowing the information
    to jump from one high point to the next until it arrived at its final destination.
    The altitude of broadcast relay stations is essential in the setup of high-speed
    aerial networks, and it was for the very same reason that the American army erected
    an elevated communication tower in Les Moëres: it needed to be able to shoot across
    the sea.'

    States Government of communications facilities at Flobecq and at other sites*.”
    (Flobecq, a charming, elevated city in the center of Belgium, would become the
    nerve center of American communications facilities some years later.) Belgium
    agreed to facilitate the American project “*at rates no higher than would be paid
    by the Belgian Armed Forces*,” the equipment remaining the property of the United
    States, in return for which the latter “may operate without interruption telecommunications
    facilities within duly authorized frequencies and signal strengths.”

    to be operational. According to a telegram sent from Brussels to the State Department
    in Washington on April 6, 1973 at 6 p.m. (cable declassified in 2005 and made
    public by WikiLeaks in 2011), the completion date for these installations, scheduled
    for the month of May 1973, could not be honored after contract renegotiations
    with Philco, a company manufacturing radio equipment. The message also specifies
    that, while some sites were almost completed, another was significantly behind
    due to the need for additional studies to verify soil density and to begin excavation
    works. Soldiers posted in Brussels also confirmed that they had encountered problems
    with other sites, not in Belgium but in England, and suggested postponing the
    start date until the beginning of 1974\. We learn from this telegram that various
    military properties came to occupy Belgian lands, all of them equipped with communication
    towers, in Westrozebeke, Flobecq, Le Chenois, Ben-Ahin, and Houtem. Belgium did
    not have a major strategic importance for the United States—at least not yet—but
    this occupation could be explained by the flat country’s placement between two
    significantly more sensitive nations: England to the west, and Germany to the

    to the four corners of the globe under the name of the Defense Communication System
    (DCS), an ambitious program justified by the tensions of the Cold War and whose
    principal objective was to create, using radio waves, the local or global communications
    networks needed by the American Marines, Army, and Air Force, from the United
    States to Japan, passing through the Old Continent, the Middle East, the countries
    of the Persian Gulf, India and its surrounding countries, and along with all of
    this a network connecting the United States to England *via*Greenland and Iceland.
    In Europe, the U.S. Air Force command center had been set up since 1952 in the
    famous German base of Ramstein. From this post the army created various networks
    extending westward to Belgium and England (where the United States could make
    use of towers erected by the Royal Air Force [RAF] during World War II), but also
    to the south, in Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Greece, all the way to Turkey, where
    forces installed a tower on the massif home to the same Mount Cithaeron cited
    by Aeschylus in his tragedy.

    on March 7, 1966, on an impulse by General de Gaulle, France announced its intention
    to leave the integrated military command of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
    (NATO). The following year, NATO headquarters moved to Brussels; the United States
    transferred over thirty air force, army, and naval bases to Belgium and Germany;
    and the new military command center, the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe
    (SHAPE), was established near the Belgian village of Mons, where it remains today.
    The organization, which at the time had its own communication network, Ace High,
    connecting Turkey to Norway by way of Greece, Italy, France, and England, through
    82 relay stations, was also banned from French territory. NATO was thus obligated
    to use a new network, an “*alternative route*,” that circumnavigated the French
    hexagon to the east, passing through Switzerland, Germany, and Belgium, taking
    advantage of the military installations the United States had been establishing
    in the flat country since the Belgian-American agreements of 1963\. This was how
    the tower in Les Moëres, probably completed at the end of 1973, served the American
    Defense Communication System and NATO’s Ace High at the same time, the American
    army having made sure to erect the structure 300 meters from the Franco-Belgian
    border in order to avoid any diplomatic incidents with France should the pole
    catch fire and collapse on the wrong side of the border.

    in Europe*,published in 1989, the tower in Les Moëres was used by DCS and by Ace High
    for troposcatter communications. These connections use ultra-high-frequency waves
    (between 300 MHz and 3 GHz) reflected by the troposphere (the layer of the atmosphere
    closest to the Earth), allowing encoded information in the radio signal to travel
    up to 300 kilometers between two relay stations. They were thus used more to connect
    the continents to one another than for solely “terrestrial” networks. According
    to a former U.S. Air Force sergeant who worked on the maintenance of European
    networks, the tropospheric antennas in in Houtem played a crucial role in the
    operation ensuring the repatriation to Europe of soldiers who had been victims
    of a suicide bombing committed in October 1983 by the Islamic Jihad Organization,
    an attack that heavily impacted an American contingent based in Beirut.

    that the tower was used chiefly for other types of radio connections. It seems
    to have even constituted a veritable case study, as three articles published three
    years after its erection attest: “The use of multiple diversity to minimize the
    effects of ducting on a long microwave path” (1975), “Delay line requirements
    for Houtem-Swingate link” (1976), and “Signal level distributions and fade event
    analyses for a 5 GHz microwave link across the English Channel” (1979). This last
    was published by the American Department of Commerce, itself mandated by the U.S.
    Air Force to run “point-to-point” connection tests with the aid of microwaves.
    Unlike ultra-high frequency waves, microwaves (from 1 to 300 GHz) cannot reach
    the heights of the troposphere. They require two dishes placed in “line of sight”
    formation, or two dishes that absolutely must be visible to one another, since
    the optimal signal propagation between the two relays is horizontal—or more precisely
    geodesic, the Earth being a sphere. As the earth’s curvature hardly allows each
    “hop,” or the distance between two parabolas, to exceed 100 kilometers, the “Hertzian
    beams” are used for “continental,” not global, networks.'

    a few kilometers from the coast so that the American army could create a point-to-point
    microwave path between Houtem and Swingate, in England, or a hop of 88 kilometers.
    In the 1960s, when this radio hop was created, the village of Swingate, north
    of Dover, was dominated by the famous Three Sisters: three masts only 111 meters
    high, erected by the RAF between 1936 and 1938 to track German fighter planes
    near the English coasts. The Three Sisters were themselves part of the Chain Home,
    a vast set of radars used to monitor the presence of foreign aircraft. One of
    the posts, threatening to crumble, was destroyed in 2010, but two years later,
    at the moment the Belgian government was considering putting the Houtem tower
    up for sale, the Two still-valiant Sisters were classified as “historical monuments”
    for the services they had rendered during World War II (after the conflict was
    over, the two English sisters were also used by Ace High, the NATO network, until
    the 1980s).'

    of Les Moëres was a question of necessity, for the American army, to have a hop
    that passed over the North Sea. This allowed the DCS network to extend from the
    center of England to Germany, passing through the “Belgian” military properties
    ordained in the 1963 agreements. According to a declassified U.S. Air Force communiqué,
    the Defense Communication System began transitioning in 1979 to the Digital European
    Backbone (DEB), which replaced “*existing analog microwave equipment in Italy,
    Germany, Belgium, Holland, and the United Kingdom with digital microwave and bulk
    encryption equipment. This upgrade involves buildings, or expanding facilities
    and towers*.” Phase III of DEB, mentioned in the communiqué, began in 1988 and
    specifically concerned England and Belgium, particularly the Houtem-Swingate connection,
    in order “*to shape a quad-diversity line of site [sic] digital communications
    system and [provide] connectivity across the English Channel*.”

    which surveyed all American military assets spread throughout the world. Mention
    is made therein of a “*Houtem Radio Relay Site*,” identified as “*active*” although
    the report suggests the site was no longer a real priority, even that it was no
    longer in use at all. It is estimated, for instance, that the budget necessary
    for a real renovation of the tower, given the state of obsolescence of the infrastructure
    and the new norms in place, would be 1.2 million euros—making it, by surface area,
    one of the highest restoration costs of the era for an American property established
    in Belgium. So the United States abandoned Houtem, until the communiqué dated
    January 20, 2006, in which the Defense Department “*announced the decision to
    inactivate and return three microwave radio relay sites to Belgium: Houtem, Westrozebeke
    et Flobecq. Closure of these sites will result in an estimated annual savings
    of $84,000 based on a comparison of the current annual operations and maintenance
    costs to an annual replacement commercial communications cost. These actions will
    permit more resources to be focused on other U.S. Air Forces Europe (USAFE) mission
    requirements. The United States no longer requires these sites since the service
    provided by the radio relay system installed in 1996 will be replaced by higher-capacity,
    lower cost commercial communications service*.” Without explicitly saying so,
    the army made it clear that its communications would no longer travel through
    the air but under the ground, thanks to a newer technology than radio waves: fiber
    optics, which offer twice the bandwidth.'

    new lands of Les Moëres as a shared economic space where the “*public good*,”
    dear to Leonardus Lessius, and a form of “communality” might prevail against those
    who sought to “*dominate the market*.” Some centuries later, a Chicago firm’s
    acquisition of the Houtem tower, which it refused to share with anyone else, revealed
    that occupation had become a private matter for those who sought to master the
    markets by using an immense tower to dominate the landscape. A new kind of battle
    over liquidity would now reign in Les Moëres, one in which the waves sent forth
    by the Chicago company would cross, in the fogs of the North Sea, those of competitors
    no less greedy for speed, and sometimes for liquidity—a new kind of occupation
    of space: aerial, nearly invisible, and silent.'
