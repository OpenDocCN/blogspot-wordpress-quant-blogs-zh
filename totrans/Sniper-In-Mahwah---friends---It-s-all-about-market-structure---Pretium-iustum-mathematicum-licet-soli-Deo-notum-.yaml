    twenty minutes, the highest bid was already 700,000 euros, which thrilled the
    Ministry of Defence (which had secretly concluded that it would make out handsomely
    on anything over 400,000 euros) but destabilized the auctioneer. He decided to
    raise the bid increment to 10,000 euros in order to accelerate the sale, after
    which the highest bid quickly reached 1 million euros, then 1.1 million euros,
    1.2 million euros, 1.3 million euros, 1.4 million euros… By 2 million, one hour
    later, the increasingly sweaty auctioneer called a recess and took refuge in the
    restroom to compose himself. History gives no record of what went through his
    thoughts as he looked at the bewildered face in the mirror. “On the sellers’ side,
    nobody had any idea what was happening,” recalls a witness, himself all the more

    the name of the descendants of the ancient Celtic tribes who had lived there in
    palafittes, wooden houses on stilts that rested on stone mounds known as *pols*.

    Moëres地区的Houtem。一种奇异的词源学将“Moëres”追溯到“Morini”，这是曾经居住在那里、住在木质高脚屋（称为*pols*）里的古老凯尔特部落的后裔。这些史前湖畔城市很可能是这个地区人类居住的第一个形式，而这个地区随后的历史则被一场漫长且不平等的与流动性的斗争所标记。
- en: 'In the Neolithic era, Les Moëres was part of the delta of the Aa (a river whose
    source is in France, south of Saint-Omer), an immense gulf ranging from Calais
    to Nieuwpoort. Only a few islets of land emerged, on which the Morini set up their
    palafittes. When Caesar’s troops arrived in Morinia, the region was just a huge
    chain of putrid swamps, far from ideal for a military occupation. Nonetheless,
    according to his *Commentaries on the Gallic Wars*, Caesar had enormous difficulty
    getting the best of the Morini: “*Of all people, the Belgians are the bravest*,”
    he wrote, a formula the inhabitants of this flat country still like to quote to
    this day, even though in reality the word *brave*was meant to highlight the boorishness
    of the local “barbarians.” By dint of lengthy battles, the Romans finally subdued
    the Morini, but did not settle in this inhospitable region. They were more interested
    in the port of Boulogne-sur-Mer, farther south, from which they planned to invade
    England. It is also possible that they decided to keep the marshes intact since,
    when they were flooded by the sea (which occurred frequently), they formed a natural
    impregnable barrier, thus protecting the territory from regular incursion by the
    Saxons.'

- en: Nonetheless, year over year, with efficient drainage, Les Moëres were sometimes
    able to be cultivated, at least until the fourth century, when the Aa delta was
    entirely submerged following a brutal climate shift. The gulf then transformed
    into an immense sedimentary basin where peat and clay began to appear. When, a
    century later, the Roman Empire crumbled, a few missionaries attempted to Christianize
    Morinia, but without any real success. It would not be until the sixth century

- en: 'The first people responsible for draining the swamps were probably the monks
    from the abbey of Saint-Augustin-lès-Thérouanne, founded in 544 a few kilometers

    defined as a “land that has been subtracted from the impetuosity of the sea’s
    tides and floods, by man,” would automatically belong to the abbey. It is not
    insignificant that the Benedictines, who later colonized the north of France,
    came from the English region of the Fenlands, a swampy territory where the monks
    had tried various techniques for drying up the waters by draining the liquidity.
    Thanks to this expertise, the Aa delta began slowly to dry out, certain rivers
    were canalized, and the Neolithic *pols*turned into *polders*. But the bad weather

    colonized 法国北部的本尼迪克特人来自英格兰的费恩兰地区，这是一个沼泽地带，僧侣们尝试了各种排水技术来干燥水分。凭借这一专业知识，阿河三角洲开始逐渐干涸，一些河流被运河化，新石器时代的*波尔*变成了*波尔德*。但是，恶劣的天气和洪水经常来破坏僧侣的劳动：有时整个地区，被排水并被耕种，在一夜之间就陷入了水下。
- en: 'Despite rapid Christianization, which led to new ways of occupying space,^([1])and
    the construction of several monasteries involved in drying the territory, draining
    such large quantities of water was punishing work – a bottomless pit. For that
    matter, since every *terra nova*, or *agri occupatorii*, became property of the
    monks, some of the region’s inhabitants were forced to continue living in landscapes
    saturated by pestilential water that sometimes caused lethal epidemics of malaria
    or fever. Outside of the zones controlled by the Benedictines, and then by the
    Cistercians, each community did what it could to make the water the neighbors’
    problem, until finally, faced with disease, everyone decided to form artificial
    lowland lakes, far from residential areas, called “Moëres,” from the Dutch *moer*,
    or “marsh.” It was only with the accession of the House of Flanders in the tenth
    century that the anarchic management of the lands’ drainage came to an end. In
    the twelfth century, Philip of Alsace decided to dry the entirety of the coast,
    from Calais to Nieuwpoort, which was then divided into four sections called *wateringues*.
    This titanic construction still did not entirely meet its objectives: floods,
    spring tides, tempests, epidemics, military conflicts, and famines undermined
    the enterprise. Nature was a hostile ground, something to be ceaselessly fought

    in 1107, Benedictine and then Cistercian, situated a few kilometers to the north

    in the thirteenth century. It boasted a vast domain of several thousand hectares,
    all along the coast from Dunkirk to the Netherlands, which saw the construction
    of numerous barns and other outbuildings. But the Cistercians were hardly worried
    about Les Moëres, which nonetheless counted among their possessions at the time.
    They simply built a farm, the Groot Moerhof, on a spit of land that cut into the
    marsh, the highest point in the region, in order to exploit the peat that had
    formed around the swampy lake when the Quaternary forests were submerged by water
    in the fourth century. In reality, this exploitation only made the situation worse:
    extracting the peat required the extension of the marsh, and the water became
    more and more invasive, reducing the surrounding cultivatable surface area accordingly.'

  zh: 另一方面，第四个*湿地地带*，即现在的Les Moëres，并没有取得任何显著的进展。当时欧洲最富有的修道院之一，[Ten Duinen Abbey](https://www.tenduinen.be/en)（沙丘修道院），成立于1107年，先是本笃会，然后是熙笃会，位于沼泽地以北几公里处，尽管如此，它在十三世纪还是迎来了财务和智力上的辉煌时刻。它拥有几千公顷的广阔领地，从敦刻尔克一直延伸到荷兰沿海地区，建有许多谷仓和其他附属建筑。但熙笃会修士对Les
    Moëres并不太关心，尽管当时它属于他们的财产之一。他们在切割沼泽地的沙洲上，该地区最高的地方，建立了一个农场，名为Groot Moerhof，以开发在第四世纪当第四纪森林被水淹没时形成的泥炭。实际上，这种开发反而使情况变得更糟：开采泥炭需要扩大沼泽地，水变得越来越具有侵略性，相应地减少了周围的耕作面积。
- en: 'The Abbey enjoyed great prosperity, but the monks left the natives to marinate
    in the stagnant waters of Les Moëres, which, protected from the sea by sand dunes,
    had become an interior lake whose altitude ranged between 2 and 4 meters above
    sea level, and from which the liquidity could not escape. *Ceteris paribus*, the
    Abbey of the Dunes also had to pit itself against nature to survive: in addition
    to the Hundred Years War and assaults from the Calvinists, it was beset by extremely
    frequent floods which gradually took over the occupied lands, diminishing the
    monks’ financial revenues. The Cistercians became scarcer and scarcer, and only
    about twenty of them still occupied the Abbey when the Protestants finally burned
    it down in 1578\. Unable to continue funding the maintenance required to reinforce
    the dikes separating them from the sea, the monks were ultimately overtaken by
    the sands. The few who remained in the community took refuge in one of the monastic
    barns they owned, some kilometers from the silted-up abbey. The end of the Cistercian
    occupation of the grounds around Les Moëres once again aggravated the situation,
    the waters that had been drained by the monks once again flowing into the interior
    lake and not into the sea.'

  zh: 修道院曾盛极一时，但僧侣们却让当地居民留在了勒莫雷的停滞水域中，这片被沙丘从海洋中保护起来的内陆湖泊，海拔在2至4米之间，水分无法逃逸。在其他条件相同的情况下，沙丘修道院也必须与自然抗争以求生存：除了百年战争和加尔文派的袭击外，它还频繁遭受洪水侵袭，逐渐占据了僧侣们占领的土地，减少了他们的经济收入。僧侣越来越少，当新教徒最终在1578年将其焚毁时，只剩下大约二十名僧侣居住在修道院中。由于无法继续资助加固使他们与海洋分离的堤坝所需的维护费用，僧侣们最终被沙子吞噬。留在社区中的少数人躲进了一座他们拥有的位于修道院几公里外的修道院粮仓中。勒莫雷周围的地面再次被僧侣占领的结束再次加剧了局势，一度被僧侣排干的水再次流入内陆湖泊而不是流入大海。
- en: 'The polderization of Les Moëres was almost completed some time later, thanks
    to the colossal works of a remarkable painter, architect, engineer, and economist.
    Born in 1550 in Antwerp, [Wenceslas Cobergher](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wenceslas_Cobergher)
    spent the first half of his life in Italy, until Albert and Isabella of Austria,
    who ruled the Southern Netherlands, arranged for his return to Brussels around
    1604\. Named lead engineer by the archdukes, he built several churches and painted
    some canvases in and around Brussels, and also occupied himself with “economics.”
    He was responsible for the first mount of piety in this part of Europe, which
    opened in Brussels in 1618 at the behest of Albert and Isabella, a project he
    defended in a text in verse entitled [*Apologia ofte Bescherm-redenen tegen het
    kekelen van de onredelijcke vyanden, ende oock de tegenraeders, van de Berghen
    van*](https://books.google.be/books?id=NPhGAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q&f=false)
    *[Bermherticheyt](https://books.google.be/books?id=NPhGAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q&f=false) *(“Apology
    or defense against criticism by the unreasonable enemies and adversaries of the
    Mounts of Piety”). Mounts of piety had been created by Italian Franciscans in
    the second half of the fifteenth century to combat the abusive practices of Lombard
    usurers and Jewish bankers, who lent money at an interest rate of 30 to 40 percent,
    whereas mounts of piety, semi-public institutions, charged only 15 percent. Cobergher
    went on to create more than a dozen mounts of piety in the Netherlands but, like
    the archdukes, had to face opposition from Lombard lenders, who were defended
    by certain theologians, and from the authorities of the city of Brussels, who
    did not look too kindly on the fiscal privileges accorded these new mounts of
    piety and those who worked in them. The “industrious Cobergher” nonetheless received
    considerable support from the Jesuit [Leonardus Lessius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardus_Lessius),
    an eminent but unfairly unrecognized thinker of modern economics,^([2])who, in
    his monumental treatise *De iustitia et iure*, published in 1605, defended these
    public institutions: “*It is necessary to work hard and to do everything we can
    so that such mounts may be erected everywhere in our cities—after the suppression
    of usurers who exhaust the resources of people everywhere by dominating the market*.”
    For Lessius, who was not opposed to the market *per se*, “economic salvation”
    would come by way of, among others, these “mountains of money” which lent at reasonable
    rates and participated in a more equitable distribution of wealth. “*Bono publico
    nati sumus*,” the Jesuit affirmed: we are born for the public good. It was by
    respecting this precept to the letter that Cobergher, some years later, returned
    to his role as engineer to take on the simultaneously technical and economical
    project that was Les Moëres.'

  zh: 莱莫尔的排水工程后来几乎完成了，这要归功于一位杰出画家、建筑师、工程师和经济学家的大规模工程。出生于1550年的安特卫普的[温琴斯拉斯·科伯格her](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wenceslas_Cobergher)在意大利度过了他人生的前半段，直到统治南尼德兰的奥地利阿尔伯特和伊莎贝拉安排他在1604年左右返回布鲁塞尔。被奥匈帝国公爵任命为首席工程师，他在布鲁塞尔及其周边地区建造了几座教堂，并绘制了一些画布，还涉足了“经济学”。他负责了欧洲这部分的第一个救济院，这是在阿尔伯特和伊莎贝拉的命令下于1618年在布鲁塞尔开业的，他还在一篇名为[*Apologia
    ofte Bescherm-redenen tegen het kekelen van de onredelijcke vyanden, ende oock
    de tegenraeders, van de Berghen van*](https://books.google.be/books?id=NPhGAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q&f=false)
    *[Bermherticheyt](https://books.google.be/books?id=NPhGAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q&f=false)”（“或为对抗不合理的敌人及其对手的救济院批评的辩护”）中为这个项目辩护。救济院是意大利方济各会在十五世纪下半叶为了对抗伦巴第放贷者和犹太银行家的滥用行为而设立的，这些放贷者以30至40%的利率放贷，而救济院，作为半公共机构，只收取15%的利息。科伯格her继续在荷兰创建了十几个救济院，但与公爵一样，他不得不面对来自伦巴第放贷者的反对，这些放贷者得到了某些神学家的辩护，还必须面对对布鲁塞尔当局的反对，他们对这些新救济院及其工作人员享有的税收特权并不感冒。然而，“勤勉的科伯格her”得到了耶稣会士[莱昂哈德·莱修斯](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardus_Lessius)的大力支持，他是现代经济学的杰出但未得到充分认识的思想家，在1605年发表的《De
    iustitia et iure》一书中为这些公共机构辩护：“*我们必须努力工作，尽我们所能，以便在我们的城市中建立这样的救济院——在取消通过控制市场而消耗人民资源的放贷者之后*。”对莱修斯来说，他并不反对市场*本身*，“经济救赎”将通过合理利率贷款和参与更公平的财富分配等方式实现，其中包括这些“金钱之山”。耶稣会士断言：“*Bono
    publico nati sumus*，”即我们是为了公共利益而生的。正是科伯格her严格遵守这一原则，几年后回归工程师角色，承担了技术和经济同时进行的莱莫尔项目。

    land rights; among other issues, the Cistercians of the Dunes, though silted in,
    invoked an old fishing right over a part of Les Moëres. Others came to claim parcels
    of land, but the archdukes decided unilaterally to appropriate the marsh and declare
    that three fifths of the future *terræ novæ *belonged to them (along with wind,
    water, and fishing rights), reserving the remaining two fifths for Cobergher to
    do with as he pleased. Cobergher the engineer remained faithful to Cobergher the
    economist, proving more charitable than the Cistercians: in order to keep rich
    entrepreneurs from coming to buy the lands once these had become fertile—as they
    promised to be—he ensured that those who worked for him on the drainage project
    would be exempted from taxes throughout the construction and for six months thereafter,

- en: 'Work began in 1619\. Cobergher began by establishing a dike all around the
    lake, which formed an ellipse of 30 square kilometers. All along this dike, he
    had a canal dug 3 meters deep and 20 kilometers long: the Ringsloot, or “ring
    canal.” This Ringsloot then connected with another 10-kilometer canal (“Canal
    des Moëres”) that went as far as Dunkirk, where, at low tide, the water from Les
    Moëres could flow through a lock into the North Sea. After three years of colossal
    labor to complete this first phase, Cobergher turned to the most arduous task:
    extracting the water from the lake to transport it to the Ringsloot. Here he decided
    to use wind against water: he had 23 windmills constructed along the ring canal,
    each equipped with a vertical screw in the shape of a helix (known as an Archimedes’
    screw), so that the power of the wind could lift the water from Les Moëres. “*When
    these machines, which served at the same time to grind wheat, began to work and
    we saw torrents of water flowing into the Ringsloot, and at the same time the
    water level lowered in Les Moëres, and then toward the end of the year the land
    became visible in several places, there was general enthusiasm in the region*,”
    reported the local historian Louis Quarré-Reybourbon in 1892\. The liquidity appeared

  zh: 工作始于1619年。库贝赫尔首先建立了一圈围绕湖泊的堤坝，形成了30平方公里的椭圆形区域。沿着这条堤坝，他挖了一条深3米、长20公里的运河：环形运河。这条环形运河随后与另一条10公里的运河（莫埃运河）相连，一直延伸到敦刻尔克，在那里，退潮时，莫埃地区的湖水可以通过一个水闸流入北海。在完成了这一阶段的第一项工作三年之后，库贝赫尔转而进行最为艰巨的任务：将湖水抽干，然后将其运输到环形运河。他决定利用风和水对抗：在环形运河边建造了23座风车，每座风车都配备了一个垂直的螺旋形螺旋桨（即阿基米德螺旋），这样风的力量就能将莫埃地区的湖水提升。当地历史学家路易·夸尔-雷布尔邦在1892年报告说：“*当这些同时用来磨麦子的机器开始运作，我们看到大量的水流入环形运河，同时莫埃地区的水平面下降，年底时，在几个地方土地变得可见，该地区普遍充满了热情*。”流动性似乎已经被击败。
- en: 'But new disputes related to grounds and water management arose at the end of
    1622\. Due to the works Cobergher had done, the administrators of the *wateringue*abutting
    Les Moëres (to the south of the lake) could no longer evacuate their water properly.
    They brought the case to court but were quickly dismissed. Shortly thereafter,
    the recent polder was literally attacked by town counselors from the village of
    Veurne (to the north of the lake this time). With the agreement of the Abbey of
    the Dunes, which surely saw this as an opportunity for revenge, they broke a section
    of the dike surrounding the Ringsloot and stole the reeds that Cobergher’s workers
    had used to cover the mills. Between this tense climate and a wind so unfavorable
    that the mills remained immobile for at least six months, Cobergher could not
    finish his great project: stagnant water remained in the shallows of the marsh.
    The engineer, so as not to be “*hastened with wyfe and chylde toward his euident
    ruin*” when “*by industrie and extraordinary labour*” he “*hath surmounted many
    difficulties at great personal expense and risk to his lyfe*,” requested an extension

- en: 'By the end of 1626, for the first time in almost five thousand years, there
    was no more liquidity in Les Moëres. To do away with the last of the moisture,
    Cobergher had cut the 30 square kilometers of new polders into 114 *cavels*, rectangular
    “agricultural racks” measuring 220 × 109 meters, sanitized by underground ceramic
    drains and surrounded by secondary channels leading the water from the shallows
    toward the Ringsloot. Rapeseed began growing all around the canals’ 28 kilometers.
    As planned, the engineer took possession of the space reserved for him but quickly
    sold his landed properties: Cobergher, decidedly more hospitable than the Cistercians,
    had also negotiated a certain number of “privileges” for those who bought these
    new lands, particularly a tax exemption and the assurance that no good would be
    consigned to military use. Moreover, since maintenance of the Ringsloot was essential
    to the continued drainage of Les Moëres—the residents’ life and work depended
    on it—he ensured that the villages were endowed with a communal administration
    whereby business could be managed collectively by the citizens.'

    Moëres持续排水至关重要——居民的生活和工作的方方面面都依赖于它——他确保村庄拥有共同的管理机构，使市民可以集体管理商业事务。
- en: 'Alas, twelve years after Cobergher’s death, during the Thirty Years War, Dunkirk
    came under siege. The Spanish who took over the city decided to close the locks
    and break down the canal dikes in order to create an aquatic line of defense,
    and Les Moëres was submerged in a night. All habitations and farms were destroyed.
    Only the church survived, its cross-capped bell tower emerging above the water,
    the only visible trace of a collective prosperity now disappeared. It would take
    two more centuries for the drainage of the lake to be complete once more. A more
    recent technology, the steam engine, allowed the windmills to remain active even
    without wind. These water pumps were then named after rivers (Po, Rhine, Danube,
    Tagus, Ganges, Seine…). The primal state of Les Moëres was wild, swampy, and foul.
    Its second state—dry, benevolent, molded over centuries by relentless human effort
    and engineering—attracted many farmers, often from far away. But the water would
    return: during World War I, the French, taking their cue from of the Spanish,
    flooded Les Moëres to prevent German troops from entering their territory through
    Belgium. Emboldened by this experience, the Germans anticipated this maneuver
    in World War II and flooded the polder themselves to slow the advance of French
    troops. The polder had become its own military apparatus—a liquid one.'

    buyers of the military property put up for sale by the Ministry of Defence arrived
    near the Franco-Belgian border, the sky was as gray as the land. The terrain of
    the quadrangular fields is made up of clay and muddy gray sands, the ground is
    carved into greenish rectilinear canals, and in winter, when the fields are bare,
    the whole thing melts into a single ash-colored horizon. Perfectly flat, the lands
    extend as far as the eye can see, their flatness reinforced by the altostratus
    clouds from the North Sea. It is a surprising atmosphere, arousing the strange
    feeling of being in a reticular nowhere from which possible horizons somehow radiate,
    one where time seems to stand still. The polder’s uniformity is reinforced by
    the grid of agricultural parcels, by the perfectly straight lines of the hydraulic
    network and of the paths—a model emblematic of that rectitude which some see as
    an icon of modernity, the triumph of human rational thought over the vicissitudes

    2 meters above sea level, stands up thanks to 48 guy-wires, taut cables between
    the tower and the eight anchor points solidly fixed in the middle of the field
    thanks to concrete stilts dug 15 meters deep, indispensable given the liquid nature
    of the ground. Thanks to the tension of the guy-wires, the 243.5 meters of the
    iron monolith—whose circular base, placed on a concrete block, measures only 20
    centimeters in diameter—rise delicately into the sky, an immense vertical line
    prolonging the horizontal lines of the polder, in a silence disturbed only by
    that singular electric vibration caused by the wind whispering against the guy-wires.

    Aeschylus described, as early as 458 B.C., in his tragedy *Agamemnon*, how a communication
    network was used to reveal the name of the victor in the Trojan War to the residents
    of Mycenae, four hundred kilometers as the crow flies from the battlefield, in
    a single night: “*From Ida’s top to Hephaestus, lord of fire, / Sent forth his
    sign; and on, and ever on, / Beacon to beacon sped the courier flame. / From Ida
    to the crag, that Hermes loves, / Of Lemnos; thence unto the steep sublime / Of
    Athos, throne of Zeus, the broad blaze flared. / Thence, raised aloft to shoot
    across the sea, / The moving light, rejoicing in its strength, / Sped from the
    pyre of pine, and urged its way, / In golden glory, like some strange new sun,
    / Onward, and reached Macistus’ watching heights*.”[3]The precision with which
    the locations are described makes it easy to [map](https://oklo.org/2014/11/28/optical-data-transmission/)
    this route, which used a simple flame-generated light signal—the equivalent of
    a bit, in the computing sense—on several hills from which the signal could be
    seen from afar (Mount Ida, Mount Athos, Mount Cithaeron, etc.), allowing the information
    to jump from one high point to the next until it arrived at its final destination.
    The altitude of broadcast relay stations is essential in the setup of high-speed
    aerial networks, and it was for the very same reason that the American army erected
    an elevated communication tower in Les Moëres: it needed to be able to shoot across

    他的信号发出；火炬接着火炬，/ 信使之火飞速传递。/ 从伊达到赫尔墨斯所爱的莱姆诺斯岛峭壁；/ 然后到达宙斯宝座的阿托斯高山之巅。/ 从那里，高高地升起来越过海洋，/
    移动的光芒，欣喜于自己的力量，/ 从松木篝火中飞出，催促着前进，/ 在金色荣耀中，如同某种奇异的新太阳，/ 向前，到达麦克西斯守望的高地*。”[3]描述这些地点的精确度使得很容易[映射](https://oklo.org/2014/11/28/optical-data-transmission/)这条路线，该路线使用简单的火焰生成光信号——在计算机意义上相当于一个比特——在几个山头上的信号可以远距离看到（如伊达山、阿托斯山、基泰隆山等），允许信息从一个高地点到下一个高地点跳跃，直到到达最终目的地。广播中继站的高度在高速空中网络的设置中至关重要，正因为如此，美国军队在莱斯莫埃尔斯建立了一个

  zh: 美国的这一项目也扩展到了这三个国家之外。在国防通信系统（DCS）的名称下，它遍及全球各地。这是一个以冷战紧张局势为正当理由的雄心勃勃的计划，其主要目标是利用无线电波创建美国海军陆战队、陆军和空军需要的本地或全球通信网络，从美国到日本，穿过旧大陆、中东、波斯湾国家、印度及其周边国家，以及贯穿这一切的一个连接美国与英国的网络*经由*格陵兰岛和冰岛。在欧洲，美国空军指挥中心自1952年以来就设在了著名的德国拉姆斯坦基地。从这个岗位出发，军队创建了各种向西延伸的网络，到达比利时和英国（美国可以利用皇家空军（RAF）在第二次世界大战期间建造的塔楼），但也是向南，在西班牙、葡萄牙、意大利和希腊，一直延伸到土耳其，在那里，力量在同样由埃斯库罗斯在其悲剧中提到的基萨山上的同一高地安装了一座塔。
- en: This deployment of communication infrastructuretook another direction when,
    on March 7, 1966, on an impulse by General de Gaulle, France announced its intention
    to leave the integrated military command of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
    (NATO). The following year, NATO headquarters moved to Brussels; the United States
    transferred over thirty air force, army, and naval bases to Belgium and Germany;
    and the new military command center, the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe
    (SHAPE), was established near the Belgian village of Mons, where it remains today.
    The organization, which at the time had its own communication network, Ace High,
    connecting Turkey to Norway by way of Greece, Italy, France, and England, through
    82 relay stations, was also banned from French territory. NATO was thus obligated
    to use a new network, an “*alternative route*,” that circumnavigated the French
    hexagon to the east, passing through Switzerland, Germany, and Belgium, taking
    advantage of the military installations the United States had been establishing
    in the flat country since the Belgian-American agreements of 1963\. This was how
    the tower in Les Moëres, probably completed at the end of 1973, served the American
    Defense Communication System and NATO’s Ace High at the same time, the American
    army having made sure to erect the structure 300 meters from the Franco-Belgian
    border in order to avoid any diplomatic incidents with France should the pole
    catch fire and collapse on the wrong side of the border.

  zh: 当法国总统戴高乐于1966年3月7日宣布法国有意脱离北大西洋公约组织（NATO）的 integrated military command 时，通信基础设施的部署方向发生了变化。第二年，NATO总部迁至布鲁塞尔；美国将三十多个空军、陆军和海军基地转让给比利时和德国；新的军事指挥中心，即欧洲盟军最高司令部（SHAPE），在比利时蒙斯附近的村庄建立，至今仍在那里。当时该组织有自己的通信网络，即Ace
    High，通过82个中继站将土耳其与挪威连接起来，途径希腊、意大利、法国和英国。该组织也被禁止在法国领土上使用。因此，NATO被迫使用一个新的网络，“*替代路线*”，该路线绕过法国六边形向东，穿过瑞士、德国和比利时，利用美国自1963年比美协议以来在平坦国家建立的军事设施。这就是为什么Les
    Moëres的塔楼，可能在1973年底完工，同时服务于美国的国防通信系统和NATO的Ace High的原因。美国军队确保将该结构建在法比边境300米处，以免在塔楼失火并倒在边境错误的一侧时引发任何与法国的外交纠纷。
- en: According to a directory entitled *United States Military Forces and Installations
    in Europe*,published in 1989, the tower in Les Moëres was used by DCS and by Ace High
    for troposcatter communications. These connections use ultra-high-frequency waves
    (between 300 MHz and 3 GHz) reflected by the troposphere (the layer of the atmosphere
    closest to the Earth), allowing encoded information in the radio signal to travel
    up to 300 kilometers between two relay stations. They were thus used more to connect
    the continents to one another than for solely “terrestrial” networks. According
    to a former U.S. Air Force sergeant who worked on the maintenance of European
    networks, the tropospheric antennas in in Houtem played a crucial role in the
    operation ensuring the repatriation to Europe of soldiers who had been victims
    of a suicide bombing committed in October 1983 by the Islamic Jihad Organization,
    an attack that heavily impacted an American contingent based in Beirut.

  zh: 根据1989年出版的一本名为*美国在欧洲的军事力量和设施*的目录，莱莫尔斯的塔由DCS和Ace High用于对流层散射通信。这些连接使用超短波（300
    MHz至3 GHz），这些波通过对流层（大气层中最接近地球的一层）反射，允许编码信息在无线电信号中旅行，两个中继站之间的距离可达300公里。因此，它们更多地用于将大陆相互连接，而不是仅用于“地面”网络。根据一位曾负责维护欧洲网络的前美国空军军士长说，霍滕的对流层天线在确保1983年10月伊斯兰圣战组织自杀式爆炸袭击的受害者士兵返回欧洲的行动中发挥了关键作用，这次袭击严重影响了驻贝鲁特的美军部队。
- en: 'But *United States Military Forces and Installations in Europe*also mentions
    that the tower was used chiefly for other types of radio connections. It seems
    to have even constituted a veritable case study, as three articles published three
    years after its erection attest: “The use of multiple diversity to minimize the
    effects of ducting on a long microwave path” (1975), “Delay line requirements
    for Houtem-Swingate link” (1976), and “Signal level distributions and fade event
    analyses for a 5 GHz microwave link across the English Channel” (1979). This last
    was published by the American Department of Commerce, itself mandated by the U.S.
    Air Force to run “point-to-point” connection tests with the aid of microwaves.
    Unlike ultra-high frequency waves, microwaves (from 1 to 300 GHz) cannot reach
    the heights of the troposphere. They require two dishes placed in “line of sight”
    formation, or two dishes that absolutely must be visible to one another, since
    the optimal signal propagation between the two relays is horizontal—or more precisely
    geodesic, the Earth being a sphere. As the earth’s curvature hardly allows each
    “hop,” or the distance between two parabolas, to exceed 100 kilometers, the “Hertzian
    beams” are used for “continental,” not global, networks.'

    GHz微波链路的信号水平分布和衰落事件分析”（1979年）。后一篇由美国商务部发表，其本身受美国空军委托，利用微波进行“点对点”连接测试。与超短波不同，微波（从1到300
    GHz）无法达到对流层的高度。它们需要两个放置在“视线” formation中的天线，或者两个绝对必须互相可见的天线，因为两个中继器之间的最佳信号传播是水平的——或者更准确地说是大地测量学的，因为地球是球形的。由于地球的曲率几乎不允许每次“跳跃”，或者两个抛物线之间的距离超过100公里，“赫兹波束”用于“大陆”网络，而不是全球网络。

    a few kilometers from the coast so that the American army could create a point-to-point
    microwave path between Houtem and Swingate, in England, or a hop of 88 kilometers.
    In the 1960s, when this radio hop was created, the village of Swingate, north
    of Dover, was dominated by the famous Three Sisters: three masts only 111 meters
    high, erected by the RAF between 1936 and 1938 to track German fighter planes
    near the English coasts. The Three Sisters were themselves part of the Chain Home,
    a vast set of radars used to monitor the presence of foreign aircraft. One of

    of Les Moëres was a question of necessity, for the American army, to have a hop
    that passed over the North Sea. This allowed the DCS network to extend from the
    center of England to Germany, passing through the “Belgian” military properties
    ordained in the 1963 agreements. According to a declassified U.S. Air Force communiqué,
    the Defense Communication System began transitioning in 1979 to the Digital European
    Backbone (DEB), which replaced “*existing analog microwave equipment in Italy,
    Germany, Belgium, Holland, and the United Kingdom with digital microwave and bulk
    encryption equipment. This upgrade involves buildings, or expanding facilities
    and towers*.” Phase III of DEB, mentioned in the communiqué, began in 1988 and
    specifically concerned England and Belgium, particularly the Houtem-Swingate connection,
    in order “*to shape a quad-diversity line of site [sic] digital communications
    system and [provide] connectivity across the English Channel*.”

  zh: 在Les Moëres建立一座完全垂直的塔楼的原因是出于必要，因为美国军队需要一条能横跨北海的跳频线路。这使得DCS网络可以从英格兰中心延伸到德国，穿过1963年协议中规定的“比利时”军事地产。根据一份解密的美军通讯稿，国防通信系统从1979年开始向数字欧洲骨干网（DEB）过渡，用数字微波和批量加密设备替换了意大利、德国、比利时、荷兰和英国的“现有模拟微波设备”。这次升级涉及到建筑物，或扩大设施和塔楼。”通讯稿中提到的DEB第三阶段始于1988年，特别涉及英格兰和比利时，特别是Houtem-Swingate连接，以“*形成一个四重多样性视线数字通信系统，并跨越英吉利海峡提供连通性*。”
- en: 'The Houtem property is mentioned one final time, ten years later, in a report
    by the American Department of Defense, *Base Structure Report. Fiscal Year 1999,*
    which surveyed all American military assets spread throughout the world. Mention
    is made therein of a “*Houtem Radio Relay Site*,” identified as “*active*” although
    the report suggests the site was no longer a real priority, even that it was no
    longer in use at all. It is estimated, for instance, that the budget necessary
    for a real renovation of the tower, given the state of obsolescence of the infrastructure
    and the new norms in place, would be 1.2 million euros—making it, by surface area,
    one of the highest restoration costs of the era for an American property established
    in Belgium. So the United States abandoned Houtem, until the communiqué dated
    January 20, 2006, in which the Defense Department “*announced the decision to
    inactivate and return three microwave radio relay sites to Belgium: Houtem, Westrozebeke
    et Flobecq. Closure of these sites will result in an estimated annual savings
    of $84,000 based on a comparison of the current annual operations and maintenance
    costs to an annual replacement commercial communications cost. These actions will
    permit more resources to be focused on other U.S. Air Forces Europe (USAFE) mission
    requirements. The United States no longer requires these sites since the service
    provided by the radio relay system installed in 1996 will be replaced by higher-capacity,
    lower cost commercial communications service*.” Without explicitly saying so,
    the army made it clear that its communications would no longer travel through
    the air but under the ground, thanks to a newer technology than radio waves: fiber
    optics, which offer twice the bandwidth.'

  zh: 霍特姆财产最终在一次提及，十年后，在美国国防部的一份报告中，*基地结构报告。1999财年*，该报告调查了遍布全世界的所有美国军事资产。报告中提到了一个“*霍特姆无线中继站*”，尽管该报告暗示该地点已不再是真正的优先事项，甚至可能已经完全不再使用。例如，考虑到基础设施的过时状态和实施的新标准，对塔进行真正翻新的预算可能需要120万欧元——按占地面积计算，这是当时美国在比利时财产的最高的翻新成本之一。因此，美国放弃了霍特姆，直到2006年1月20日的新闻稿，五角大楼宣布“*决定使三个微波无线中继站失效并归还给比利时：霍特姆、韦斯特罗泽贝克和弗洛贝克。关闭这些站点将导致基于当前年度运行和维护成本与年度更换商业通信成本的比较，估计每年可节省84,000美元。这些行动将使更多资源得以集中用于美国空军欧洲（USAFE）的其他任务需求。美国不再需要这些站点，因为1996年安装的无线接力系统所提供的服务将被更高容量、成本更低的商业通信服务所取代*。”虽然没有明确说明，但军队暗示其通信将不再通过空气传播，而是通过地下，感谢比无线电波更先进的新技术：光纤，其带宽是无线电波的两倍。
- en: 'The American army’s conversion to cables, signaling the end of a long period
    of investment in radio infrastructures in Belgium, should have marked the definitive
    dismantling of the iron monolith—had other Americans, against all expectations,
    not turned up in Houtem in December 2012\. Wenceslas Cobergher had molded the
    new lands of Les Moëres as a shared economic space where the “*public good*,”
    dear to Leonardus Lessius, and a form of “communality” might prevail against those
    who sought to “*dominate the market*.” Some centuries later, a Chicago firm’s
    acquisition of the Houtem tower, which it refused to share with anyone else, revealed
    that occupation had become a private matter for those who sought to master the
    markets by using an immense tower to dominate the landscape. A new kind of battle
    over liquidity would now reign in Les Moëres, one in which the waves sent forth
    by the Chicago company would cross, in the fogs of the North Sea, those of competitors
    no less greedy for speed, and sometimes for liquidity—a new kind of occupation
    of space: aerial, nearly invisible, and silent.'

  zh: 美国军队改用电缆，标志着比利时无线电基础设施长期投资时期的结束，应该标志着铁碑的最终拆除——如果不是其他美国人出乎意料地在2012年12月出现在霍特姆的话。文森斯·科伯格塑造了勒莫雷的新土地作为一个共享的经济空间，在那里“*公共利益*”，令勒桑ius
    Lessius感到珍贵，以及一种“*共有性*”可能战胜那些寻求“*市场主导*”的人。几个世纪后，一家芝加哥公司收购了霍特姆塔，它拒绝与其他任何人共享，这表明占领已成为那些希望通过使用巨大塔楼来控制市场的人的私人事务。现在，流动性的新战斗将在勒莫雷
    reign，其中芝加哥公司发出的波浪将在北海的雾中与竞争对手的贪婪速度，有时是流动性的波浪交叉——一种新的空间占领方式：空中，几乎看不见，而且寂静。
