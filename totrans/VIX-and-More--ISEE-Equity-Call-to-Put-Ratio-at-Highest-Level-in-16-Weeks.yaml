- en: The [ISEE](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/ISEE) equity [call to
    put ratio](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/put%20to%20call) hit a
    16 week high of 189 on Friday, as investors showed a strong preference for calls
    over puts. Today that ratio is even higher, at 215 as of 11:30 a.m. ET.

- en: Trading is light so far and extreme values in the ISEE have a tendency to revert
    to the mean (146) as the day wears on, but coming on the heels of Friday’s high
    number, I believe the ISEE numbers should bear watching throughout the day.

- en: For the record, the last time the ISEE equity call to put ratio was over 200
    in a single session was back in the middle of May. At that time, the markets were
    just in the process of putting in a post-March top.
