    effects of a trade war, the tail-risk of the loss of business confidence in a
    full-blown trade war is difficult to measure. In addition, the US and China may
    be on the verge of Cold War 2.0, which would disrupt and bifurcate technology
    platforms and supply chains.

    every domain, from semiconductors to submarines and from blockbuster films to
    lunar exploration. The two superpowers used to seek a win-win world. Today winning
    seems to involve the other lot’s defeat—a collapse that permanently subordinates
    China to the American order; or a humbled America that retreats from the western
    Pacific. It is a new kind of cold war that could leave no winners at all.

    important as Winston Churchill's "iron curtain" speech in 1946 that marked the
    start of the Cold War with the Soviet Union.

    in a globalized competition between two political and economic systems. While
    my base case scenario calls for a brief truce to be achieved probably in late
    2019, the onset of Cold War 2.0 represents a tectonic shift in global trade and
    investment flows that will have multi-decade long investment implications.
