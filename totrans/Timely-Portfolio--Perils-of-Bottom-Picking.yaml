- en: Compounding negative returns is not as splendid as [Albert Einstein’s (if he
    said it at all) “most powerful force in the universe”](http://www.snopes.com/quotes/einstein/interest.asp)
    of compounding interest or positive returns.  Drawdown is a series of traps or
    a compounding of really ugly negative returns.  Let’s say that you as master investor
    exited your $1,000,000 million position in the S&P 500 at the exact top in October
    2007 at 1576.09.  You wait very patiently and based on your investment experience
    from 1980-2006, reenter at 1214.91 down 23% seven months later as discussed in
    [in Barron's July 2008](http://online.barrons.com/article/SB121546198979133377.html?mod=googlenews_barrons). 
    The money you don’t lose or save is not 55% (total loss to S&P) – the 23% you
    missed.  Rather, it is still a very painful loss of 44% and it does not seem so
    genius even with a genius exit.  This trap hurt a lot of supposed geniuses that
    earned that reputation from 1980-2006.
