- en: The average funding rate paid by long ETH swap holders has been 63% annualized
    since it started trading in August 2018, considerably higher than BitMex’s BTC
    swap rate of 6%. You can go long ETH, short the BitMEX ETH perpetual swap, and
    make 63% annualized on a flat book. You might need 20% down on your perp, so 63%
    divided by 1.2, but that’s still a nice risk-free return.

    funding rate anomaly is just the result of the parochial pricing algorithm, which
    generates a convoluted payout.

- en: BitMex’s large ETH swap funding rate results from the fact that payments are
    denominated in BTC, which is highly correlated with ETH. Adjusting the funding
    rate for the positive BTC~ETH covariance adds convexity to the long ETHUSD swap
    return. The swap funding rate for ETH adjusts for this, leaving a net funding
    rate near zero. BitMEX makes enough money via standard trading and liquidations,
    so they [explicitly direct](https://archive.ph/ONG7E) their market makers to break
    even over time.

- en: The ETHUSD funding rate is like the [convexity adjustment](https://www.cmegroup.com/education/courses/introduction-to-eurodollars/understanding-convexity-bias.html)
    in Eurodollar futures needed to compare them with Eurodollar interest rate swap
    rates. In the case of futures vs. swaps, the subtle difference comes from the
    fact that the futures pay out their pnl each quarter while the swaps accrue it,
    and the payout is correlated with interest rates that accrue on that pnl. Similarly,
    when the long ETH position pays off bitcoin, the value of that bitcoin will tend
    to be higher. The Eurodollar futures-swap convexity adjustment became well-publicized
    in the mid-90s, but for a good five years, several large players made millions
    on this arbitrage (you could not make money off it without institutional access
    to cross margin). As Eurodollars are one of the largest markets in the world,
    it is understandable that a large market like the ETHUSD could also miss this
    adjustment.

    is because the BTC notional amount is in USD, and we have to ultimately translate
    that back into BTC. It looks funny but is quite straightforward in its effect.
    Actually, admirably clever.

- en: Interestingly, the average funding rate over this period was around 63%. This
    implies an average ETH perp premium of negative 3%, basically zero. A short ETHUSD
    position hedged against a long ETH position would have lost 66% in USD terms due
    to the convexity generated by the ETH~BTC covariance. The high funding rate for
    this product is an equilibrium rate that offsets this convexity adjustment, generating
    no arbitrage opportunity.
