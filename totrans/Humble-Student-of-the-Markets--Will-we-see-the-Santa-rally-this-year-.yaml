- en: The recent stock market rally has been astounding. Sentiment readings on the
    Fear & Greed Index surged from extreme fear in October to extreme greed in less
    than two months. While extremely fearful sentiment can be useful buy signals,
    extreme bullish sentiments are condition indicators and inexact sell signals.
    This leads to the tactical conclusion that it’s too late for investment-oriented
    accounts to be adding risk. Bulls should wait for a likely pullback for a lower-risk
    entry point.

    the model readings with a brief commentary. There will be no mid-week market update
    next week barring unforeseen volatility. The regular publication schedule will
    resume the weekend of January 30.'
