    to understand what could hide behind that Livermore Index. To guess your filter
    and try to replicate the findings of your Top10, I tried to read between the lines.

    inventions are 70% made of luck):'

    going higher: the recent performance of a stock for a break-out system (à la O’Neill,
    Livermore or Darvas 😉 with a close stop and an exit with a low DV2 should tell
    you about that => My first indicator'

- en: 2) You mentionned volumes… A strong stock always climbs on more volume than
    during its corrections. What about a ratio of the sum of the volume of positive
    days by the sum of the volume of the negative days => My second indicator
