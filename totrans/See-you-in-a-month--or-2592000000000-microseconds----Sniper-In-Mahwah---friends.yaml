    a trader I would never be at the top of the queue for sure). Human beings don’t
    live in a world where micro, nano and picoseconds matter, and I’m not a [white
    rabbit](http://www.eurexchange.com/exchange-en/resources/initiatives/technical-changes/high-precision-time-white-rabbit-pilot).
    I have planned to write here the last episode of Bob Van Valzah’s series *Shortwave
    Trading* (about the sites in Europe), and other posts about HFT but I’m currently
    trying to write this 96-page book one the (quite crazy) history of the microwave
    networks (both in the US and in Europe – my *backyard*). Since I’m so late, I
    decided to disappear for a month (more or less 2592000000000 microseconds) to
    finish the book.'

- en: Chapter 1 (/4) is done, mostly devoted to the very long history of the Moëres,
    the area where Jump Trading purchased the old US military tower in Houtem, Belgium,
    near the Channel, in December 2012\. This history is intriguing (it is all about
    straight lines, liquidity and economics, long before Jump came around). This history
    led me to add a chapter to the book (which was not planned at the outset).

    me to design the map I’ll include in the book as a postcard (if you don’t know
    Joost’s work, check out [this](http://www.joostgrootens.nl/#atlases)). I have
    so much respect for his (immense) work that I am very honored he accepted to give
    a hand up on this project. Now it’s time to finish the book. I’ll be back when
    it’s done. See you in 2592000000000 microseconds.
