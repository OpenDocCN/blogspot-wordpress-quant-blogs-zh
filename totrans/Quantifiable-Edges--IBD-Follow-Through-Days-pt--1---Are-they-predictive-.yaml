- en: 1) What determines a “significant decline”? Declines can be determined many
    ways. Some may say it would require a series of lowers lows and lower highs. Others
    might say a certain amount of time should be involved. Others would simply look
    at a percentage drop to determine significance. I’m going to keep it simple and
    just look at percent drops. What percent is most appropriate is also arguable.
    For today’s test I chose 8%. In future studies I will look at multiple levels,
    so don’t worry if you don’t like my choice. There are two primary and subjective
    reasons I chose 8%. First, I wanted a number that wasn’t too small that I was
    testing every minor correction. A 5% drop could just be a few bad days so that
    seemed too small. Second, I didn’t want a number too large that IBD followers
    would tell me about all the great rallies my study missed. Since there weren’t
    any 10% declines in the S&P 500 from March 2003 through 2006, and Investors Business
    Daily published several Follow Through Day calls over that period of time, 10%
    seemed too large. I picked somewhere in the middle – 8%.

  zh: 1) 什么决定了“显著的下跌”？下跌可以有多种确定方式。有些人可能会说它需要一系列的低点和高点的降低。其他人可能会说应该涉及一定的时间。其他人可能会简单地查看百分比下降来确定重要性。我将保持简单，只查看百分比下降。最合适的百分比也是可以争论的。今天的测试我选择了8%。在未来的研究中，我将考虑多个水平，所以如果你不喜欢我的选择，不用担心。我选择8%有两个主要的主观原因。首先，我希望一个不是太小的数字，这样我就测试每一个小的修正。5%的跌幅可能只是几天不好，所以这似乎太小了。其次，我不想一个太大的数字，这样IBD追随者会告诉我我的研究错过了所有的伟大反弹。由于2003年3月至2006年期间，标普500没有出现10%的跌幅，而《投资者商业日报》在那段时间内发布了几次跟进日的调用，10%似乎太大了。我选择了一个中间的数字

    success or failure was based on the movement in the S&P 500\. I did this because
    of the three major indices (Dow 30, Nasdaq, and S&P 500), the S&P was the broadest
    and generally considered the most representative of the overall market. What should
    be noted, though, is that I allowed a Follow Through Day to be triggered by any

- en: by either “multiple signs of distribution – significant down days in higher
    volume” or “if one of the major indices undercuts its recent lows”. I was less
    stringent and said that the S&P 500 specifically would have to CLOSE below the
    INTRADAY low of the bottom prior to the Follow Through Day. (This decision incidentally
    made the 08/06/2002 Follow Through Day a success whereas most people would have
    labeled it a failure – and some the October 2002 bottom a failure.) Until that
    happened, it still had a chance to succeed. IBD has never offered a clear definition
    of success, so here I was on my own. I first decided that if you were going to
    use the Follow Through Day to make money then there should be a good portion of
    the move remaining. Therefore the target for success was set at twice the distance
    from the close of the Follow Through Day to the low of the potential bottom day.
    As hard as bottoms are to pick, I believe tops are even more difficult, so if
    you lose a third of the move off the bottom, you may also lose a third off the
    top. Therefore I wanted the meat of the move in the middle (potential reward)
    to be at least as much as the initial thrust (potential risk). There were a few
    instances where the market actually made new highs without fulfilling this requirement
    – so I made things even easier. I  said that any new 200-day high would also signal
    a “successful” Follow Through Day. This benefited several Follow Though Days.
    Instances that went from “failure” to “success” include the 08/11/1986 Follow
    Through Day and the 10/19/1989 Follow Through Day.

  zh: 通过“多个派发迹象——在较高成交量下的显著下跌日子”或者“如果主要指数跌破近期低点”。我对标普500的要求不那么严格，规定跟进交易日的前一个交易日的收盘价必须低于当日的盘中低点。（这个决定使2002年8月6日的跟进交易日成为成功，而大多数人可能会将其标记为失败——有些人甚至将2002年10月的底部也标记为失败。）在发生之前，它仍然有成功的机会。投资者商业日报从未提供一个清晰的成功的定义，所以我只能自己决定。我首先决定，如果你想使用跟进交易日来赚钱，那么应该还有大部分的变动剩余。因此，成功的目标被设定为从跟进交易日的收盘价到潜在底部日的低点的两倍距离。底部虽然难以预测，但我认为顶部更加困难，所以如果你在底部失去了一半的变动，你可能会在顶部也失去一半。因此，我希望变动的中间部分（潜在收益）至少与初始推动（潜在风险）一样多。市场实际上在没有满足这一要求的情况下创下了新高的情况——所以我让事情变得更容易。我说任何新的200天高点也将标志着一个“成功的”跟进交易日。这使几个跟进交易日受益。从“失败”到“成功”的实例包括1986年8月11日的跟进交易日和1989年10月19日的跟进交易日。
- en: I ran the tests back to December of 1971\. Since the Nasdaq began trading in
    1971 and I wanted to include that as a possible trigger, it made 1971 a reasonable
    starting year. I needed about 200 bars of data to run some of the calculations
    and that is why the test only goes back to December of that year. While Investors
    Business Daily’s research undoubtedly goes back further, 37 years of data is plenty
    for me. Success or failure prior to that doesn’t concern me greatly.

  zh: 我从1971年12月开始了测试。由于纳斯达克市场于1971年开始交易，我希望将其作为可能的触发因素，因此1971年成为了一个合理的起始年份。我需要大约200个交易日的数据来运行一些计算，这就是为什么测试只追溯到那一年的12月。虽然投资者商业日报的研究无疑可以追溯到更早，但37年的数据对我来说已经足够了。在那之前成功或失败对我来说并不重要。
