    In 2003 he published a paper arguing that when people study success stories exclusively
    — as many avid devourers of business self-help books do — they come away with
    a vastly oversimplified idea of what it takes to succeed.

  zh: 正如 Denrell 在早期研究中揭示的，成功是一个特别糟糕的老师。2003年，他发表了一篇论文，论证人们如果只专门研究成功故事--就像很多商业自助书的狂热读者那样--就会对成功所需的条件有一个极其过分简化的观念。
- en: When I worked for an economics department, I quickly learned what a lame business
    we were in. Our stated purpose--to forecast the economy to allow people to make
    better decisions--was different than our actual purpose--to provide rationales
    for decisions already made, to serve as an excuse to have a get together. The
    sad thing is that a Big Lie needs many little lies, as the stated goal of forecasting
    accuracy could not be discussed openly and honestly, because if one did the stated
    purpose becomes untenable, and then the unstated purpose becomes unworkable. It's
    one of those phony little kabuki dances that seems so quaint in primitive cultures,
    but just as common in our own.

  zh: 当我在经济学系工作的时候，我很快就了解到我们所从事的业务是多么的不堪。我们表面上的宗旨--通过预测经济来使人们做出更好的决策--与我们实际的宗旨--为已经做出的决定提供理由，作为举办聚会的借口--是不同的。可悲的是，一个大谎言需要很多小谎言，因为预测准确度的表述不能公开和诚实地讨论，因为一旦有人这样做了，表面上的目标就变得站不住脚了，然后不表述的目的就无法达到。这就是那些假惺惺的小歌舞表演，看起来在原始文化中似乎很古老，但在我们自己的文化中却很普遍。
- en: A problem in this field is that accuracy spells extinction because no one wants
    to listen to an honest forecaster, they don't purport to know enough. Rather,
    listen to someone who can make you rich! In selling forecasts to the masses, honesty
    is a strictly dominated strategy.

- en: When I first got to KeyCorp after grad school I was most excited by an opportunity
    to work with their asset management group, which was the main reason I went there--the
    chance of getting into being a pm for equities. I remember pitching the idea of
    beating the S&P by a couple percent and having lower volatility by investing in
    low volatility stocks. The guy in charge said, 'I have people here who can outperform
    the S&P by 10%!' Now, clearly he didn't, and to this day I don't know if he was
    so stupid to think he really believed it, but it sure sold better than the truth,
    and selling funds is more important than returns because due to the magic of survivorship
    bias the current set of funds will always be better than average. Economic forecasts
    are even less constrained, with extreme statements as out-of-the-money options
    either paying off big or disappearing down the memory hole.

    500 指数数个百分点并且具有更低波动率的想法。 负责的人说，'我这里的人可以比标普 500 指数的表现高出 10%!' 现在可以明显地看出，他的确没有，直到今天我依然不知道他是否真的愚蠢到认为自己相信了这一点，但是这比事实真相卖得更好，而且卖基金比回报更重要，因为由于存活偏倚的神奇，当前一组基金的表现总是比平均水平要好。经济预测甚至更不受限制，极端论断就像对冲的期权，要么大赚特赚要么消失得无影无踪。

    them as either foxes (detail experts) or hedgehogs (big picture experts). He finds
    that foxes are usually right, but hedgehogs are "occasionally" right on the farthest
    out predictions. It''s a ambiguous finding, especially considering he criticizes
    experts for not being honest and diligent in their self-evaluation. When asked
    if he is a fox or a hedgehog, Tetlock said he didn''t know, but perhaps in general
    a fox with a little hedgehog in him--isn''t everyone? He notes this is the general
    pattern: foxes qualify their statements a lot, but are more correct--when you
    ignore the qualifications. Notice the recursive property here?'
