    in general. “The analyst with the largest number as well as the highest proportion
    of accurate and extreme forecasts,” they wrote, “had, by far, the worst forecasting
    record."

    In 2003 he published a paper arguing that when people study success stories exclusively
    — as many avid devourers of business self-help books do — they come away with
    a vastly oversimplified idea of what it takes to succeed.

    we were in. Our stated purpose--to forecast the economy to allow people to make
    better decisions--was different than our actual purpose--to provide rationales
    for decisions already made, to serve as an excuse to have a get together. The
    sad thing is that a Big Lie needs many little lies, as the stated goal of forecasting
    accuracy could not be discussed openly and honestly, because if one did the stated
    purpose becomes untenable, and then the unstated purpose becomes unworkable. It's
    one of those phony little kabuki dances that seems so quaint in primitive cultures,
    but just as common in our own.

    to listen to an honest forecaster, they don't purport to know enough. Rather,
    listen to someone who can make you rich! In selling forecasts to the masses, honesty
    is a strictly dominated strategy.

    to work with their asset management group, which was the main reason I went there--the
    chance of getting into being a pm for equities. I remember pitching the idea of
    beating the S&P by a couple percent and having lower volatility by investing in
    low volatility stocks. The guy in charge said, 'I have people here who can outperform
    the S&P by 10%!' Now, clearly he didn't, and to this day I don't know if he was
    so stupid to think he really believed it, but it sure sold better than the truth,
    and selling funds is more important than returns because due to the magic of survivorship
    bias the current set of funds will always be better than average. Economic forecasts
    are even less constrained, with extreme statements as out-of-the-money options
    either paying off big or disappearing down the memory hole.

- en: 'he outlines his extensive survey of experts and their predictions, and categorizes
    them as either foxes (detail experts) or hedgehogs (big picture experts). He finds
    that foxes are usually right, but hedgehogs are "occasionally" right on the farthest
    out predictions. It''s a ambiguous finding, especially considering he criticizes
    experts for not being honest and diligent in their self-evaluation. When asked
    if he is a fox or a hedgehog, Tetlock said he didn''t know, but perhaps in general
    a fox with a little hedgehog in him--isn''t everyone? He notes this is the general
    pattern: foxes qualify their statements a lot, but are more correct--when you
    ignore the qualifications. Notice the recursive property here?'

  zh: 他概述了他对专家及其预测的广泛调查，并将它们分类为狐狸（详细专家）或刺猬（宏观专家）。他发现狐狸通常是正确的，但刺猬在最遥远的预测中“偶尔”是正确的。这是一个歧义的发现，特别是考虑到他批评专家在对自己的诚实和勤奋的自我评估时不诚实。当被问及他是狐狸还是刺猬时，特洛克说他不知道，但也许总体上是一只有着一点刺猬特质的狐狸--难道不是吗？他指出这是一般的模式：狐狸经常对自己的陈述进行修饰，但在忽略这些修饰时，他们更正确。注意这里的递归属性？

    heuristic-bound behavioral economists. I think those who study biases are disproportionately
    guilty of what they study. This isn't a necessary paradox, just a tendency.
