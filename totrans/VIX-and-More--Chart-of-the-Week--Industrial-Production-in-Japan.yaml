    in the United States and a 2.0% decline in [industrial production](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/industrial%20production)
    reported two weeks ago, this seems like a good time to remind my largely Americentric
    audience that things are much worse overseas, particularly in Asia.

    and South Korea reported a December decline of 18.6%. These are staggering numbers,
    whether one chooses to compare them to U.S. data or to historical data sets.

    I have elected to compare Japanese industrial production data from December 2003
    to December 2008, partly because I like the look of the Japanese characters and
    partly because it illustrates just how dramatically Japan’s export economy declined
    during the last three months of 2008.

    to the U.S.
