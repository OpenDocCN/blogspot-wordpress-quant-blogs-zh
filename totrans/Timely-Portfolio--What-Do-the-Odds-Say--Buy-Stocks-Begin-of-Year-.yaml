- en: At some point in 2013, I read (can’t remember where) that 2012 was a rare year
    for the S&P 500  where no day’s closing  price was lower than the closing price 
    for the first day.  So if you bought on the first day of 2012, you never had a
    loss for the entire year.  Well, the same thing happened 2013, so I just had to
    do some analysis.  Below is a [dimple.js](http://dimplejs.org) chart built using
    [rCharts](http://rcharts.io/howitworks) with the minimum close price for the year
    divided by the close price for the first day of that year.
