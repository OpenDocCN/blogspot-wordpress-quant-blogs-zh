    risky assets got clobbered over anxieties about Greece today, the silver lining
    is that a short-term bottom may be forming.

- en: The chart below of SPY is just a bellwether whose analysis could be extrapolated
    to many other risky assets. The ETF formed a reversal day by selling off but rallying
    near the end of the day to a level where it roughly opened, and the action occurred on
    relatively high volume. Moreover, the selloff successfully tested a key short-term
    support level. For technicians, this action is, at a minimum, an indication of
    market indecision in the face of bad news - a positive sign. It could be more
    bullishly interpreted as capitulation selling.

- en: Even if SYRIZA earns the mandate and manages to somehow seize the reins of power,
    the changes in Greek policy will hardly be "radical," as the Coalition of the
    Radical Left's name misleadingly implies. The party's young, charismatic leader,
    Alexis Tsipras, has made it clear that ***he has no intentions of withdrawing
    Greece from the eurozone, let alone the European Union.*** Instead, we should
    expect a more nuanced approach to economic revitalization, which would likely
    include an aggressive renegotiation of the bailout terms currently in place between
    Greece and the "troika" composed of the EU, the European Central Bank, and the
    IMF, as well as a demand for more public investment in lieu of loans.

    stocks is coming up, but a long or even intermediate term bottom may have to wait.
    Given that gold prices are deflating in the wake of the French and Greek elections,
    that short-term bottom may be fast approaching.

    buy risk in anticipation of an oversold rally. My inner investor tells me to watch
    the market action in likely ensuing rally to gauge the strength of the bulls as
    this is just another phase in the choppy up-and-down market action that we have
    been witnessing in the past few weeks.
