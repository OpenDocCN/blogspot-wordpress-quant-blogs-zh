- en: The most common technique I see discussed for trading based on the VIX is viewing
    it in relation to its 10-day moving average. This was originally made popular
    by Larry Connors. Many traders will throw moving average envelopes around the
    VIX, wait for a stretch and then trade the S&P 500 based on a mean reversion.
    A relatively high VIX means market participants are fearful and the market should
    be bought while a relatively low VIX is a sign of complacency and a short signal.
    With the VIX continually dropping, traders have been on alert for a VIX stretched
    below its 10-ma to try and short. But is that really a good time to be short?

    its 10-day moving average was significantly more profitable on average than owning
    it when it wasn’t. Let me repeat that.

    Cover when it moved back above this envelope. From 5/98 until now there were 87
    such trades. The average lasted just over 3 days. The S&P actually GAINED 91.09
    points in the 272 days that this was in effect. That is an average of about 0.33
    points per day. In the other 2,379 days the market only managed to gain 184.22
    points – about 0.08 points per day. In other words, the market actually performed
    over 4 times BETTER when the VIX was stretched more than 10% below its 10-day
    moving average. Also, when this VIX-stretch was active the S&P made nearly 1/3
    of its total gains in only 9% of the time.

    but remains below its 10-day moving average on a closing basis. 2) Exit the trade
    when the VIX closes above its 10-day moving average. Here you would have had 58
    trades. The average trade would have made you about 7 S&P points and the total
    system gain, or S&P points lost, over the time period is 403.17 – a very substantial
    number.

    fall. In fact a good portion (about 1/3) of the S&P gains over the last 10 years
    have come under these conditions. When the VIX moves out of complacent territory
    and back towards its mean, then the market is susceptible to a decline.
