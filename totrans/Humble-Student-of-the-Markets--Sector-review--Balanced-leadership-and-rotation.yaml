    of analyzing changes in leadership, I use the Relative Rotation Graphs, or RRG
    charts, as the primary tool for the analysis of sector and style leadership. As
    an explanation, RRG charts are a way of depicting the changes in leadership in
    different groups, such as sectors, countries or regions, or market factors. The
    charts are organized into four quadrants. The typical group rotation pattern occurs
    in a clockwise fashion. Leading groups (top right) deteriorate to weakening groups
    (bottom right), which then rotates to lagging groups (bottom left), which changes
    to improving groups (top left), and finally completes the cycle by improving to
    leading groups (top right) again.

    and selected defensive sectors (consumer staples, healthcare, REITs) in the top
    half of the chart, indicating leadership positions. Value and cyclical sectors
    are the laggards in the bottom half.

    review reveal a more nuanced picture of the market`s leadership evolution.
