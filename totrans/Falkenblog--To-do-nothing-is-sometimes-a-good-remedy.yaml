    laws making it hard to lower wages, which when aggregate prices were falling about
    33%, meant wages had to rise in real terms. It helps current union members, but
    hurts everyone else. The only people favoring these laws are those too ignorant
    to grasp the inconsistency, those who are merely rationalizing (if subconsciously)
    their deeper desire for egalitarian redistribution (though this usually helps
    insiders), or if one of the Officially Designated Victim Groups, self-interest.

- en: that Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman Sheila Bair suggested the government
    give banks a financial incentive to turn troubled loans into more-affordable mortgages.
    Under the proposal, the government would share in any future losses on the new
    loans with lenders. If there is anyone who does not have a claim of victimhood,
    it is someone who got a mortgage they could not pay, with little money down, who
    now wants to be subsidized so that they have no loss (with a loss, they walk away
    as US banking laws mean you can default on your mortgage and not worry about the
    bank coming after your other wealth such as savings; ie these are non-recourse
    loans). The effect is then to subsidize those who behaved most recklessly, who
    have the least skin in the game, and increases the number of zombie properties
    that are not maintained because the 'owner' has abandoned the property, and the
    lenders are forced to go threw a costly and lengthy process before they take hold
    of the property, fix it up and sell it at a market-clearing price.

    incentives for people to game these new incentives. The key is to have many small
    groups, so you can parade various people from these groups so every week you can
    bring out the most sympathetic individual within the group who mentions how legislation
    allowed them to avoid the poorhouse or achieve their dreams. The net effects are
    complex, subtle, and spread around enough that it is usually impossible to statistically
    prove they caused any effect, like legislating that the government given me one
    million dollars: to prove that it makes others worse off looking at aggregate
    data is empirically impossible. My personal characteristics are such that my victimhood
    status is pretty much near the bottom of the vanguard''s list of politically attractive
    groups to subsidize, so I see these actions as basically more things they have
    magnanimously decided I should pay for--though not directly. I can see why intellectual
    mandarins, the super rich, the super poor, and muck-raking community activists
    find these actions good, because it increases their power and status.'

    man''s footprint is bad, and while certain areas may benefit, the net effect is
    bad because our meddling are unnatural. Thus, even though my state (Minnesota)
    may benefit some from Global Warming, the cost to other areas is a bad trade.
    No one would suggest adding chemicals to wetlands to ''improve'' their pH, or
    introduce new flora to improve the diodiversity, is a great way to save the environment,
    rather the objective is highly conservative: conserve energy, growth, and stop
    development. In the economy, however, Washington''s footprint is considered an
    obvious corrective to an anarchic suboptimality, because we know legislation has
    the public welfare at heart, in contrast to the individuals making decisions on
    their own, who are driven by self-interest. Every problem invites a new top down
    solution, as if top-down meddling in the form of encouraging home ownership was
    not a large, if not the singular prime mover, of the crisis we are in. The economy
    is very complex system, just like the climate or the environment. The biosystems
    and the environment, are too complex for top down intervention; the economy, however,
    needs top down solutions NOW.'

    we also need to make housing more affordable. We address the high rates of medical
    spending by giving more state-insurance and tax subsidization of medical expenditures.
    We address the high costs of college by giving more subsidies and tax breaks on
    education spending. Did it ever occur to these geniuses that less intervention
    might be a solution, as opposed to more? Lowering the subsidies, eliminating tax
    breaks on targeted spending?
