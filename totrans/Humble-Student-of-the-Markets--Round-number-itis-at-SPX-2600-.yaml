    Monday morning (Europe time) and before the market open, a grim Angela Merkel
    announced that coalition talks had collapsed, and she was unable to form a government.
    DAX futures instantly took a tumble, and so did US equity futures. Over the course
    of the European trading day, equity prices recovered and the DAX actually closed
    in the green. US stocks followed suit and closed with a slight gain. This was
    a signal that the market has a bullish short-term bias.

    high, is it time to sell the rip?
