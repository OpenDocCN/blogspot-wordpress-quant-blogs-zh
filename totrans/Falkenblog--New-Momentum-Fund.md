# Falkenblog: New Momentum Fund

> 来源：[http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2012/09/new-momentum-fund.html#0001-01-01](http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2012/09/new-momentum-fund.html#0001-01-01)

Moment is a strange factor. Historically its magnitude is comparable to value and size in Ken French's data, yet clearly less popular. Yet unlike size, value and more recently low-vol, hardly any products out there attempt to specifically harvest the momentum premium in an efficient manner. The problem is that momentum peaked in November 2008, and has not recovered (graph below using French's data).  Many think it may never recover, which perhaps is why the main momentum fund, HMTM, trades only ten thousand shares a day.

Nonetheless, my friends at Robeco 

[launched a fund](http://www.robeco.com/professionals/products/product-information.jsp?pdstchn=robecocom&pfndid=6170&plang=english)

 designed to capture the momentum premium (led by Willem Jellema, right). They think it will be attractive because momentum tends to do particularly well when low volatility and value fails (e.g. late nineties was horrible for value and low-vol, but great for momentum). More importantly, their fund has some secret sauce.  I can't say what that is, but I can vouch for the fact that there is a way to play momentum that works much better than the standard approach used in academic papers.

Update: I should add that AQR runs

[momentum funds](https://www.aqrfunds.com/OurFunds/MomentumFunds/MomentumFund/Overview.aspx)

, and Cliff Asness has been actively researching  momentum for well over a decade (see

[Value and Momentum Everywhere](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1363476)

), so he probably has some special sauce too.
