    to be an excellent way to identify the issues that readers are interested in and
    also to see how these issues evolve over time. These most-read posts also serve
    as easily accessible repositories of high-quality material for the benefit of
    new readers and long-term readers alike.

- en: While 2012 was a slow year for the VIX (the first time the VIX didn’t make it
    into the 30s since 2007), it proved to be an exciting time for the broader volatility
    products space. Looking just at the titles of the top 25 posts below, an astonishing
    9 of them reference [TVIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TVIX) or
    [UVXY](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/UVXY) in the title, reflecting
    strong reader interest in the +2x volatility products that I called “[day trading
    rocket fuel](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2011/01/tvix-finally-getting-due-as-day-trading.html)”
    back in January 2011.

    unique readers in 2012\. Farther down there are links to similar lists going back
    to 2008, along with several other “best of” type posts that I have flagged for
    [archival](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/archival) purposes.  Don’t
    necessarily start at the top and work your way down until you get bored.  For
    the record, I think #25, [Volatility During Crises](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2012/12/volatility-during-crises.html)
    is one of the top two posts of the year.  I’m not sure about #1, but [Cheating
    with Partial Hedges](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2012/05/cheating-with-partial-hedges.html),
    which didn’t even make this top 25 list, also has to be considered a strong candidate.'

    label to a handful of posts that I believe have particularly compelling and/or
    original content, regardless of readership.
