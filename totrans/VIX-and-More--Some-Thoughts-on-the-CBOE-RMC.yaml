- en: The [29^(th) Annual CBOE Risk Management Conference (RMC)](http://www.cboermc.com/http:/www.cboermc.com/),
    wound down yesterday, proving that while Chicagoans and New Yorkers were happy
    enough just to escape the snow, there were some excellent business reasons for
    making the trip to southern California.

    to congregate, get acquainted, and exchange ideas related to a subject that tends
    to be arcane and poorly understood in most quarters, yet is increasingly embraced
    by a wide variety of practitioners. Nancy Davis of AllianceBernstein probably
    summarized best what is happening in the volatility space when she identified
    three trends that are driving institutional use of options:'

- en: In terms of new entrants, the VIX product space is seeing a wide range of new
    institutional interest from hedge funds and proprietary trading firms to CTAs
    (commodity trading advisors), insurance companies and other firms, many with an
    international flavor. One of the common themes is the search for yield enhancement
    strategies. A lot of this activity can explain the recent surge in volume in [VIX
    futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures) and [VIX options](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20options).
    Whereas [VIX ETPs](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20ETN) had
    been driving volumes in VIX futures in the past, now growth is being driven by
    the participation by a broad range of new institutional players, some of whom
    are “curve hopping” from Treasuries to the VIX and many of whom are motivated
    by the lack of compelling alternatives to enhancing yield.

- en: 'In these types of events there is always one presentation that catches you
    by surprise and gives you a lot of ideas to ponder that had not necessarily been
    on your radar. For me that presentation came from [John Coates](http://www.neuroscience.cam.ac.uk/directory/profile.php?jmc98),
    the author of [The Hour Between Dog and Wolf: Risk Taking, Gut Feelings and the
    Biology of Boom and Bust](http://www.amazon.com/Hour-Between-Dog-Wolf-Feelings/dp/1594203385).
    In a wide-ranging talk, Coates has some compelling observations on physiological
    systems and how these are intertwined with everything from pleasure and addiction
    to expectations, uncertainty and risk assessment. Frankly, even if the subject
    of trading was not directly incorporated into this presentation, this talk still
    probably would have left me with more to chew on than the other presentations.'

- en: In the U.S., the RMC alternates between Florida in even years and southern California
    in odd years and is typically held during the last week of February or the first
    week in March. Last year a [CBOE RMC – Europe](http://www.cboermceurope.com/)
    conference was added in Ireland. The success of that conference has translated
    into a repeat performance that is scheduled for September 30 – October 2, 2013
    at the [Penha Longa Hotel](http://www.penhalonga.com/) in Sintra, Portugal, just
    outside of Lisbon. As a port fan who has never been to Portugal, I can certainly
    envision a trip to Portugal in September in addition to Florida next year.
