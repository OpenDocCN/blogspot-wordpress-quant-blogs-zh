- en: During the first half of 2010, a recovery in manufacturing helped to lift stocks.
    When manufacturing plateaued, stocks gave up their gains. Now it looks like manufacturing
    may be picking up again, but it has been consumer spending that has been responsible
    for much of the recent rise in equities.

- en: There are two large ETFs devoted to retailers, [XLY](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLY)
    and [XRT](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XRT). While neither is a
    great proxy for the types of stores most likely to compete for our holiday shopping
    dollars, they will both pick up the major trends. I tend to have a slight preference
    for XRT over because XRT has more holding and these are more equally distributed.
    The top holding for XLY, for instance, is McDonalds ([MCD](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/MCD)).

    below, I show the performance of XRT over the course of 2010\. Note that earlier
    in the month XRT broke above its April high and has continued to maintain a bullish
    trajectory since then. Of particularly interest is the sector’s performance relative
    to the S&P 500 index (top study), which has been very strong since stocks began
    to rally in the beginning of September.

    momentum play and should be a barometer of the strength of U.S. consumer throughout
    the holiday season.
