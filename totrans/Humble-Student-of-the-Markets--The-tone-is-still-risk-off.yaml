- en: '**Mid-week market update**: I have some good news and bad news. The good news
    is the performance of the NASDAQ 100,  the market leadership, has stabilized.
    The relative performance of the NASDAQ 100 against the S&P 500 successfully tested
    a rising relative trend line, and the relative uptrend is still intact.'

    of the market is maintaining a risk-off tone.
