    list went through several iterations, but near the top were always reminders that
    a good trader needs “patience and discipline” to be successful. The list is no
    longer there, but by now the important ideas have been branded into my psyche.

    gravitated toward trading options. More often than not I find myself selling options,
    either with or without a directional bias, and enjoying [time decay](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/time%20decay)
    (theta) work in my favor to increase my portfolio value. Recently, it occurred
    to me that selling options has made me a better trader because it has cut down
    on the number of trades I make and enhanced my patience and discipline. How does
    this happen? Each morning I look at my portfolio and see what my portfolio’s aggregate
    theta is. This tells me how much money I will make from [time decay](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/time%20decay)
    alone if the market does nothing and I do not make any trades. As a rule, I try
    to structure my portfolio so that the aggregate theta is at least as large as
    my daily profit target. For this reason, I ~~never~~ rarely feel obligated to
    “make something happen” and force trades that should not be taken.

    be comfortable trading long positions and short positions, buying options and
    selling options. Better yet, traders should not have a built in bias toward long-only
    trading or only buying calls. Ideally, a trader should be directionally agnostic
    and equally comfortable with the full menu of possible trades.

    thyself” dictum. A trader that understands his or her [personality](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/personality)
    type, comfort zones and preferences can do a better job of applying the appropriate
    [psychological approach](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/psychology)
    to trading. These skills are some of the most difficult for many traders to master.
    It is quite possible that selling options may provide a shortcut to developing
    some of those skills.
