    in structural economic reform policy going to be accomplished? I get how to do
    the macroeconomics of Obama administration economic policy. I don’t get how to
    do the structural side…

    needed for mezzanine debt in the CDO's for Alt-A mortgages, what price--or is
    it 'level of price growth'--to set for housing, and how much chromium should be
    the standard dosage in weight loss supplements.

- en: For me, the key principle in economics is that it studies the unplanned effects
    of individuals acting in their self interest. Like evolution it appears to be
    a product of design. Yet, many esteemed economists think that if we do not come
    up with a 'plan', all the key decisions in the economy won't be made anywhere
    near optimally, just as a bridge can't be built without a designer. Thus, its
    hard to say that learning more formal economics is a good idea, because clearly,
    there are no 'first principles' in this field, it still is merely a field for
    organizing and articulating your prejudices.

    to socialism because unlike Gorbachev, she didn't have to decide how many refrigerators
    to make this year--the market does that. Faith in the relative superiority of
    decentralized decisionmaking, by individuals who are not elected, is just as non-intuitive
    as it ever has been.
