    sorts of derivatives, and even relatively small moves in the final value of LIBOR
    could have resulted in daily profits or losses worth millions of dollars. In 2007,
    for instance, the loss (or gain) that Barclays stood to make from normal moves
    in interest rates over any given day was £20m ($40m at the time). In settlements
    with the Financial Services Authority (FSA) in Britain and America’s Department
    of Justice, Barclays accepted that its traders had manipulated rates on hundreds
    of occasions.

    between Barclays and regulators in America and Britain, that employees at the
    bank and at several other unnamed banks tried to rig the number time and again
    over a period of at least five years. And worse is likely to emerge. Investigations
    by regulators in several countries, including Canada, America, Japan, the EU,
    Switzerland and Britain, are looking into allegations that LIBOR and similar rates
    were rigged by large numbers of banks. Corporations and lawyers, too, are examining
    whether they can sue Barclays or other banks for harm they have suffered. That
    could cost the banking industry tens of billions of dollars. ***“This is the banking
    industry’s tobacco moment,”*** says the chief executive of a multinational bank,
    referring to the lawsuits and settlements that cost America’s tobacco industry
    more than $200 billion in 1998.“It’s that big,” he says.

    foreclosure defense. Unlike the foreclosure mills, which seem to coin money, the
    attorneys on this front are either laboring pro bono or making considerably less
    than they could in other lines of work. They also can back up their views with
    depositions and trial transcripts.

    is that mortgage servicers, either deliberately, or are sloppy by design, mis-process
    payments so that borrowers are flagged to be late and therefore the lender can
    tack on services fees. This makes the mortgage appears to be delinquent (if the
    borrower doesn't catch the mistake and complain) and that's an excuse for the
    lender to foreclose.

    $2000 per loan. ***This is a rounding error compared to the chain of title problem
    these systematic practices were designed to circumvent.*** The cost is also trivial
    in comparison to the average loan, which is roughly $180k, so the settlement represents
    about 1% of loan balances. It is less than the price of the title insurance that
    banks failed to get when they transferred the loans to the trust. It is a fraction
    of the cost of the legal expenses when foreclosures are challenged. It’s a great
    deal for the banks because no one is at any of the servicers going to jail for
    forgery and the banks have set the upper bound of the cost of riding roughshod
    over 300 years of real estate law.
