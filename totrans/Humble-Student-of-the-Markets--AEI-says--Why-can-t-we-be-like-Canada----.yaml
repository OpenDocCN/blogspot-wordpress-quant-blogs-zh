    innovation is the ATM, Citi has a useful online credit card tool where you can
    generate a credit card number for one-time use, which is handy for internet transactions.
    I have never seen a Canadian bank come up with innovations like that.)'

    is a much lower rate of loan originations by mortgage brokers in Canada (only
    35 percent) than in the U.S. (70 percent), far less mortgage securitization in
    Canada than here, and a much smaller subprime mortgage market. Banks in Canada
    keep and service 68 percent of the mortgages on their own balance sheets that
    they originate and underwrite, which encourages prudent lending since banks are
    putting much of their own capital at risk. Finally, almost all mortgage payments
    in Canada are made electronically by an automatic payment arrangement, which minimizes
    late payments. (I am not sure the size of the benefits that electronic or automatic
    payment confer. However, during the boom years, conservative think tanks like
    the AEI would have been decrying the lack of imagination of Canadians in fully
    developing a mortgage securitization market.)'

    is a higher beta system. It just so happens that the financial system underwent
    a shock - an environment where low-beta systems outperform. During the boom years,
    the AEI would have been celebrating the "innovative" nature of the higher beta
    US system.
