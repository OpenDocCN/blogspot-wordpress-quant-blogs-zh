    some issue, the meeting would often end: "well, get this and that in there, but
    don''t forget to simplify it when presented to my boss." The Senior Vice President
    would say this about the Executive Vice President, who would say this about the
    Managing Committee member, who would say this about the COO, who would say this
    about the CEO, who would say this about the Board.'

    more the 'leader' has qualities like reputation, great hair, and the ability to
    spout platitudes as if they were keen insights into the human condition. Most
    of all, they know that saying very little, or something very vague, can seem really
    intelligent when you have a lot of power. Recently, Bob Rubin, the banking expert,
    claimed that subprime exposure at Citi was a technical detail outside the scope
    of his activities, which highlights that for $115MM Citi was not paying for anything
    as prosaic as, say, risk management or portfolio advice.

    S&L crisis, and wishing to demutualize (a trick that needs approval from government).
    He then left to join Time Warner's board, eventually becoming chairman in 2003\.
    He was head of Time Warner, and left in May 2008 after not budging the stock price
    over 5 years. But he has great political bona fides, with friends among Republicans
    and Democrats, and was on Obama's economic advisory team. A large corporation,
    especially one receiving TARP money, needs expertise managing Washington no less
    than Fannie Mae, which made many of their senior executives very rich via conflating
    Fannie's self interest with some social good like encouraging home ownership (among
    people who can't afford homes).

    that banking's primary concerns are political, as they always have been. It is
    implausible to think that any such executive would have the ability or interest
    to appreciate the massive degradation in residential mortgage lending in the past
    decade, which is why just about every single large bank suffered similar problems.
    Given the nature of leaders, if the zeitgeist is for weaker standards, and there
    are no actual losses, such leaders are not going to put on the brakes. They won't
    do much of anything, other than 1) try to maintain their fiefdom via takeovers
    and avoiding takeovers and 2) lobby for favors from the government, such as keeping
    'non bank' competitors out (eg, insurance, mutual funds, foreign banks, etc),
    and expanding the latitude of services they can provide.
