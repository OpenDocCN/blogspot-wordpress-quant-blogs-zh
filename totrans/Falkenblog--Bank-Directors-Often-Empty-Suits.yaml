    some issue, the meeting would often end: "well, get this and that in there, but
    don''t forget to simplify it when presented to my boss." The Senior Vice President
    would say this about the Executive Vice President, who would say this about the
    Managing Committee member, who would say this about the COO, who would say this
    about the CEO, who would say this about the Board.'

  zh: 当我在一家银行工作时，无论你与哪个级别的高管讨论某个问题，会议经常以这样的方式结束：“把这个和那个加进去，但不要忘记在向我的老板介绍时简化一下。”高级副总裁会这样说，关于执行副总裁，执行副总裁会这样说，关于管理委员会成员，管理委员会成员会这样说，关于首席运营官，首席运营官会这样说，关于首席执行官，首席执行官会这样说，关于董事会。
- en: And they were all kind of right. The higher you go, the less technical, the
    more the 'leader' has qualities like reputation, great hair, and the ability to
    spout platitudes as if they were keen insights into the human condition. Most
    of all, they know that saying very little, or something very vague, can seem really
    intelligent when you have a lot of power. Recently, Bob Rubin, the banking expert,
    claimed that subprime exposure at Citi was a technical detail outside the scope
    of his activities, which highlights that for $115MM Citi was not paying for anything
    as prosaic as, say, risk management or portfolio advice.

  zh: 他们都有点对。你越往上走，技术含量越低，所谓的“领导者”更多地具有声望、漂亮的头发以及善于口吐陈词的能力，就好像这些陈词是对人类状况的深刻洞察一样。最重要的是，他们知道，当你拥有很大的权力时，很少说一些话，或者说一些模糊的话，似乎是非常聪明的。最近，银行业专家鲍勃·鲁宾声称，花旗银行的次级抵押贷款风险不在他的活动范围之内，这凸显了对于1.15亿美元，花旗银行没有支付任何像风险管理或投资组合建议这样的低俗东西。

    He then left to join Time Warner's board, eventually becoming chairman in 2003\.
    He was head of Time Warner, and left in May 2008 after not budging the stock price
    over 5 years. But he has great political bona fides, with friends among Republicans
    and Democrats, and was on Obama's economic advisory team. A large corporation,
    especially one receiving TARP money, needs expertise managing Washington no less
    than Fannie Mae, which made many of their senior executives very rich via conflating
    Fannie's self interest with some social good like encouraging home ownership (among
    people who can't afford homes).

  zh: '**Richard Parsons** 在 S&L 危机期间担任 Dime 银行的首席运营官，当时该银行正受到严格的监管审查，希望进行股份制改造（一种需要政府批准的伎俩）。然后他离开加入了时代华纳的董事会，最终于2003年成为董事长。他曾是时代华纳的负责人，在5年后离职，因为股价未有起色。但他拥有很强的政治背景，与共和党和民主党都有友好关系，并曾是奥巴马经济顾问团队的成员。一个大型企业，尤其是一个接受
    TARP 资金的企业，需要的不仅仅是管理经验，还需要在华盛顿有管理的专门技能，不亚于房利美那样的企业，通过将房利美的自身利益与一些社会利益混为一谈，如鼓励购房（那些负担不起房子的人）而使许多高级管理人员致富。'
- en: He's no fool, but having such people lead large banking institutions highlights
    that banking's primary concerns are political, as they always have been. It is
    implausible to think that any such executive would have the ability or interest
    to appreciate the massive degradation in residential mortgage lending in the past
    decade, which is why just about every single large bank suffered similar problems.
    Given the nature of leaders, if the zeitgeist is for weaker standards, and there
    are no actual losses, such leaders are not going to put on the brakes. They won't
    do much of anything, other than 1) try to maintain their fiefdom via takeovers
    and avoiding takeovers and 2) lobby for favors from the government, such as keeping
    'non bank' competitors out (eg, insurance, mutual funds, foreign banks, etc),
    and expanding the latitude of services they can provide.

  zh: 他并不是傻瓜，但让这样的人领导大型银行机构突显了银行业的主要关注点始终是政治性的。认为这样的高管有能力或兴趣去理解过去十年住房抵押贷款业务的严重恶化是不可信的，这就是为什么几乎每家大型银行都遭受了类似的问题。鉴于领导者的本质，如果时势倾向于更弱的标准，并且没有实际损失，这样的领导者不会刹车。他们不会做太多事情，除了1）试图通过收购和避免被收购来维持他们的封地，以及2）向政府寻求好处，比如阻止‘非银行’竞争对手（例如保险公司、共同基金、外国银行等），并扩大他们可以提供的服务范围。
