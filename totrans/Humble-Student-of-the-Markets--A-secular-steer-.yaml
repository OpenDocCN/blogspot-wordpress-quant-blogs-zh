    is no question that they are above average. As another point of reference, James

    put the P/E ratio in the low teens - which is roughly in the middle of the historical
    range.

    should be compared to the prevailing interest rates of the time. (This approach,
    by the way, forms the theoretical basis for the so-called Fed Model.) Here is
    a chart of 10-year Treasury yields going back to 1918, courtesy of

    in the single digit range, while today we are seeing P/Es in the high teens. The
    early 1950's was marked by a low interest rate regime, just as we have today.

    seeing a new secular bull market, the extraordinary measures undertaken by global
    central banks in the wake of the Lehman Crisis has front-end loaded many of the
    gains to be realized in this bull.

    and it looks like a secular bull from a technician's viewpoint. However, valuation
    analysis suggests that this market is unlikely to see the same kinds of gains.
