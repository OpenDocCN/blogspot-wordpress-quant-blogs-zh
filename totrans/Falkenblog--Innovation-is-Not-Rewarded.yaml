    the Bill Gates. They create things with spillovers. Yet, you average innovator
    is simply wrong, hearing dog whistles others don't, and like Van Gogh getting
    his appreciation after dying, most innovators do their bidding for those they
    do not know. Deviating from the consensus produces all the things that has elevated
    us from hunter-gatherers, yet, the record for the individual innovators themselves,
    is decidedly negative.

    most irrelevant, the rest just wrong. Important new ideas are extremely rare,
    which makes sense because their marginal cost, after being discovered, is trivial,
    so they spread. We don't have to independently discover the wheel, crop rotation,
    or why a Republic dominates a monarchy. If good ideas were discovered all the
    time, our heads would explode; alas, most weeks, even months, we learn nothing
    new, and not for lack of trying.

    exists not because smart people have necessarily rejected religion, but because
    religion is the "default" position for most of our society.

    are reversed. Japan, for example, has no tradition of monotheistic religion, but
    the few Japanese Christians tend to be much more educated than non-Christians
    in Japan. By the logic of someone who wants to read a lot into the Stankov study,
    Christianity must be the wave of the future, perhaps even the one true faith!
    But, of course, the vast majority of educated Japanese are not Christians. Just
    as with atheism in the West, the correctness of Christianity cannot be inferred
    from the traits of the minority who subscribe to it in Japan.

    does not imply that Atheism is necessarily a smarter choice, but rather, that
    in general elites tend to deviate from the default choice. Eventually, the masses
    emulate in the elites in subsequent generations, as Christianity or civil rights
    starts out as the belief of a small vanguard, and then becomes the modal choice
    of the great unwashed.

    is what is implied by a status oriented utility function, because you can always
    remain in the same spot by doing what everyone else is doing. Taking risk can
    mean either having zero exposure to the stock market, or double the average exposure;
    standard exposure is 'no risk'. This is why risk, and return, are not correlated

    like stereotypical MBAs, who are not so analytical but rather personable and articulate,
    tend to dominate society. I suspect MBA rule is less catastrophic than PhD or
    Mensa rule, if only because they aren't as certain of themselves. This all gets
    back to the idea there is an optimal IQ, and it's not 180, but rather, say, 125
    (probably the modal IQ for any large group leader, such as Presidents and CEOs).

    tests because of what this portends for their life (as Charles Murray noted, most
    people would prefer their kid had 15 more IQ points than get $1 million on their
    21st birthday). Yet highly intelligent people tend to innovate more, and such
    innovation tends to be counterproductive for the innovator. So, the fact really
    smart people can answer a question faster or more accurately than others, is at
    some point offset by the fact that when they have to supply the question--as is
    the case once they leave formal schooling--they will be attracted towards less
    conventional, usually irrelevant or wrong, paths. For every Steve Jobs or Albert
    Einstein there were many who lived and died in obscurity; for every

    disregard for your narrow self interest. Objectively, you will fail with a high
    probability. Like thinking about the lottery, there are happy delusions of grandeur
    considering your improbable future success. You can counter those who say, you
    should be feeding orphans in an African village, in that your efforts have large
    positive externalities. Most importantly, it's fun.
