  zh: 在我急于了解别人对市场的看法时，有两篇与VIX相关的文章特别引起了我的注意。
- en: 'It should come as no surprised that one of them comes from [Bernie Schaeffer](http://www.schaeffersresearch.com/),
    a regular in this space, whose "[Examining Sentiment in the Context of a Market
    Pullback](http://www.schaeffersresearch.com/commentary/observations.aspx?ID=19898)"
    concludes:'

  zh: 毫不奇怪，其中一篇来自[Bernie Schaeffer](http://www.schaeffersresearch.com/)，这位常客在他的文章
    "[Examining Sentiment in the Context of a Market Pullback](http://www.schaeffersresearch.com/commentary/observations.aspx?ID=19898)"
    中总结道：
- en: '"Pullbacks to support levels in a bull market when accompanied by climactic
    fear levels are almost always buying opportunities, and this diagnosis applies
    today. This does not necessarily mean today was the bottom, but it does strongly
    imply that it would be foolish to exit this market in response to the gloom and
    doom headlines."'

  zh: “在牛市中，当伴随有极端恐惧水平时，回调到支撑水平几乎总是买入机会，这种诊断适用于今天。这并不意味着今天是底部，但它确实强烈暗示，仅仅因为一些悲观标题就退出市场是愚蠢的。”
- en: 'I was also interested to see what [Mark Longo](http://tradersmagazine.com/search.cfm?submit=yes&freetxt=longo&x=10&y=9),
    a long time contributor to [Trader''s Magazine](http://tradersmagazine.com/index.cfm),
    thinks of the VIX in the context of the current market. Writing for [The Options
    Insider](http://www.theoptionsinsider.com/), Longo provides some interesting historical
    context for the VIX and wonders aloud if we are entering a new era of continued
    high volatility. Looking at some of the VIX options action, he points out that
    "the so-called ''smart money'' is betting that the current volatility trend will
    continue, at least in the near-term." Siding with the smart money crowd, Longo
    concludes:'

  zh: 我也很好奇[Mark Longo](http://tradersmagazine.com/search.cfm?submit=yes&freetxt=longo&x=10&y=9)，这位《交易者杂志》的长期撰稿人如何看待VIX与当前市场的关系。在为《期权内部人士》撰写文章时，Longo为VIX提供了一些有趣的历史背景，并怀疑我们是否正进入一个持续高波动性的新时代。他观察到一些VIX期权的动作，指出“所谓的‘聪明钱’正在押注当前的波动性趋势将继续，至少在短期内。”与聪明钱阵营站在一边，Longo得出结论：
- en: '> "...with oil and credit concerns looming on the horizon, it certainly appears
    as though the VIX may have finally awakened from its long slumber." These are
    two perspectives are recommended reading, along with those of a dozen VIX-fluent
    bloggers:'
