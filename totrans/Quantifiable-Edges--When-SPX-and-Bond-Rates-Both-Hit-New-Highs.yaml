- en: The fact that the 10-year bond rates hit new highs Friday along with the SPX
    is notable. The study below last appeared in the 12/9/10 subscriber letter. Stats
    are current.

- en: Generally it seems that higher interest rates have often made bonds an attractive
    investment. This may lead people to forsake stocks in favor of lower risk returns
    with improved yield. Implications of this study appear to be longer-term in nature
    than we usually see. We are still not 50 days out from the 12/8/10 occurrence,
    but that one appears unlikely to finish in the red.  Over the last two months
    more bullish forces have had their way. In last night's letter I showed how this
    edge has been consistent since the late 60s / early 70s.  I view this occurence
    as an intermediate-term warning sign.
