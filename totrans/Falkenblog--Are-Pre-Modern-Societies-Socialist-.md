# Falkenblog: Are Pre-Modern Societies Socialist?

Many assume that pre-modern society was communistic, like hunter gatherers, and these roots give us a socialist intuition. Larry Arnhart

[argues this simply isn't true](http://darwinianconservatism.blogspot.com/2013/07/the-mps-in-galapagos-evolutionary.html)

, that hunter-gatherer societies share big game meat, but most everything else is shared communistically only within the nuclear family, other things are more quid-pro-quo.

 This comes up a lot, as Emmanuel Todd writes interesting books about European history, as in his 1990

[L’invention de l’Europe](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/L'Invention_de_l'Europe)

. He makes the bold claim that political ideology is the result of three things: family structure, literacy, and godlessness. In the modern age with universal literacy and godlessness, political ideologies are mainly projections of a people’s unconscious premodern family values.

 As my politics are opposite of my two siblings, my family structure clearly explains little, but perhaps that's just because I'm truly exceptional.
