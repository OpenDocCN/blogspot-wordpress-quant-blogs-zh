    a bit light in the Microsoft Certification department. Many of the great technical
    people that I have run into on Wall Street do not have Microsoft Certifications,
    mainly because..... well, they are too busy at work to persue it. As a long time
    consultant, I have never been asked by a potential client if I was certified.

    of marketing your organization. Microsoft likes to see an organization with a
    certain percentage of certified employees before they will allocate you "partner"
    status.

    for the exams resulted in any substantial gains for you or your organization?
