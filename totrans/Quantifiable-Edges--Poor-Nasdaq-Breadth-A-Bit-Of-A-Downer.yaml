- en: Below is one study that appeared in the Quantifinder last night. It suggests
    a bearish edge thanks primarily to the poor Nasdaq breadth on Thursday. I’ve updated
    the table from the 4/29/09 blog below.

- en: I should note that while there appears to be a bit of a bearish edge, this study
    is faced with some conflicting bullish ones that I’ve discussed over the last
    few days in the Subscriber Letter. The outlook isn’t completely cut and dry. I
    did think the study was worth noting and updating though.
