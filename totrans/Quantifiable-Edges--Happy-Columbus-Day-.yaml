- en: While the stock market is open on Monday, banks, schools, government offices,
    and the bond market are closed. In past years with the bond market closed, the
    stock market has done quite well on Columbus Day. Of course the most famous Columbus
    Day rally was in 2008 when the market gained over 11% after having crashed the
    week before. This year circumstances are much different and the market has put
    in some nice gains this week. In the Subscriber Letter last year I showed research
    that suggested an up week prior to Columbus Day typically made for a good Columbus
    Day. Below I have updated some of that research.

    10 trades profitable and winners nearly twice the size of losers risk/reward has
    been very favorable. It appears positive momentum from the prior week has shown
    a fairly strong tendency to follow through on Columbus Day. Below is the profit
    curve.

    Day does appear to provide a solid seasonal edge. Happy Columbus Day!
