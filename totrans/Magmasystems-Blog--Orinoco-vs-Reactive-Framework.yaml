- en: I have been doing a bit of playing around with the new Reactive Framework (Rx)
    lately. And, I like what I see so far.

- en: The first thing that came to mind was how the Orinoco team was going to resolve
    the fact that another LINQ-based streaming API was coming out of a "competitive"
    group in Microsoft.

- en: A little birdie has told me that recently, Microsoft merged several of the competitive
    division, and that Orinoco product was going to use Rx as the LINQ-based surface
    API.

- en: If this is true, will this mean that we all have to wait until .NET 4.0 in order
    to use Orinoco? Or, will there be a .NET 3.5 SP2 that contains the necessary Systems
    DLLs? If .NET 4.0 is required, it would be an interesting situation for a lot
    of the very large customers (like us) who are quite a ways away from even looking
    at .NET 4.0\. Not to mention the certification process that most companies have
    to go through before adopting a major .NET release.

- en: By the way ... Too bad that I had to hear this news from external sources, as
    the Orinoco team has gone very quiet lately. Let's just hope that it's because
    of the summer vacation, or because their developers are heads down in code. And,
    like Matt Davey pondered ... How can they be releasing CTP 2 when CTP 1 has not
    even gone out yet?
