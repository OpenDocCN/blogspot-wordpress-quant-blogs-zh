    with economics and psychology work as if our creator wrote it· ‘As if’ assumptions
    are often trueBertrand Russell (1872-1970) was an eminent philosopher, mathematician,
    and logician, and an avowed atheist. In his *History of Western Philosophy*, he
    discusses many arguments for the existence of God—first cause, natural law—and
    finds them all logically defective, except the argument from design. This is the
    argument that there are things in the known world which cannot plausibly be explained
    as the product of blind natural forces, but are reasonably regarded as evidences
    of a purpose. He notes there is no formal logical defect, and the veracity of
    this hypothesis turns on ‘comparatively detailed considerations.’ He found the
    theory of evolution adequate to rebut this theory, but a lot has been discovered
    since then.*[Hereafter I denote the ‘argument from design’ aka ‘intelligent design,’
    as **ID**, the theory that life, or the universe, did not arise by chance and
    was designed and created by some intelligent entity. ‘Evolution’ and ‘evolutionist’
    the theory and those who believe in the theory, that all life on Earth descended
    from some primal organism(s) that arose at least 600 million years ago, via strictly
    natural processes of descent with modification, mutation, and natural selection.]*If
    you share Russell’s intellectual interests the theory of evolution is the most
    important argument for the existence of God. That could be any God, and many then
    rely on miracles, prophesy or historical records, but I am strictly looking at
    things more inferentially. The New Testament reads like an instruction manual
    by our creator in terms of its helpfulness in this world, consistency with healthful
    psychology, ethics, and economics.  For these reasons, plus the belief in a creator,
    I find faith in Christ a purely rational decision.**Evolution Just Like Abiogenesis**Charles
    Darwin’s grandfather, Erasmus, speculated about spontaneous generation, that life
    may have arisen via some “living filament” imbued with “animality,” which subsequently
    continued to improve, generation after generation, and create myriad forms of
    life. In her 1831 introduction to Frankenstein, Mary Shelly wrote of him, “They
    talked of the experiments of Dr. Darwin…who preserved a piece of vermicelli in
    a glass case, till by some extraordinary means it began to move with voluntary
    motion.” She went on to speculate that electricity was the extraordinary means,
    clearly influenced by Galvani’s 1780 experiments showing how frog muscles contract
    when stimulated with this new force of nature. Charles Darwin was aware of Louis
    Pasteur’s recent work that showed that spontaneous generation of anything that
    looks like a modern living organism was impossible, such that from the beginning,
    evolutionary theorists conceded that the appearance of initial life forms had
    yet to be explained. Yet, at that time, the cell and simple life forms were considered
    trivial, as cells were simply filled with “protoplasm,” some sort of homogenous
    jelly. Ernst Haeckel, with whom Darwin corresponded and to whom he made reference
    in his *Origin of Species*, believed that the first life form was a kind of cell
    that would be “an entirely homogeneous and structureless substance, a living particle
    of albumin, capable of nourishment and reproduction.”[1]Later in Darwin’s life,
    scientists found something that appeared to be the first proto-cell, and gave
    it the official scientific name of *Eozoon canadense.* Darwin noted this as a
    candidate for the first life form in the fourth edition of the *Origin of Species*.
    When Darwin’s friend and advocate, Thomas Henry Huxley, discovered a seeming progenitor
    to this in oceanic mud, scientists spent several years collecting sea mud looking
    for evidence of early life. Alas, they soon discovered that onewas merely a chemical
    precipitate of lime produced by the mixture of alcohol and seawater, while the
    other was a product of heat and pressure. Neither was remotely organic.[2] Just
    as his grandfather did, Darwin believed that the discovery of the first life form
    would occur soon. However, despite his initial enthusiasm, the problem of the
    origin of life has become much thornier. The more we learn about the minimum necessary
    components of life, the more complicated it gets. For something to be an organism,
    it needs to reproduce, metabolize energy, and create a cell wall. The most basic
    cell requires at least a hundred proteins, each of which has approximately 300
    amino acids, and all need to be able to work with each other.

    **ID**，这一理论认为，生命或宇宙并非偶然产生，而是由某些智能实体设计和创造的。‘进化’和‘进化论者’是指这一理论以及相信这一理论的人，即地球上所有生命都是至少6亿年前从一些原始生物开始通过纯自然的进化、变异和自然选择的过程逐渐演化而来的。]*如果你和罗素一样对进化论感兴趣，那么进化论是上帝存在的最重要的论证。这可能是任何一个上帝，然后许多人依赖奇迹、预言或历史记录，但我严格地从更推理的角度看待事物。新约读起来像是我们的创造者在这个世界上的一本说明书，它在心理学、伦理学和经济学方面与健康的一致性。出于这些原因，再加上对创造者的信仰，我认为信仰基督是一个纯粹的理性决定。**进化就像原始生命的起源一样**查尔斯·达尔文的祖父，厄拉斯姆斯，推测生命可能是通过一些“富含‘生命力’的‘生命丝’”而起的，随后不断改进，一代又一代地创造出形形色色的生命形式。在1831年的《弗兰肯斯坦》介绍中，玛丽·雪莱写道：“他们谈论达尔文博士的实验……他保存了一块维米切利在玻璃盒里，直到通过一些非凡的手段开始自愿运动。”她接着推测说电是那种非凡手段，显然受到加尔瓦尼1780年实验的影响，显示了青蛙肌肉在受到这种新的自然力刺激时如何收缩。查尔斯·达尔文知道路易·巴斯德最近的工作表明任何看起来像现代生物的自发生成都是不可能的，以至于从一开始，进化论者们就承认最初生命形式的出现尚未得到解释。然而，那时，细胞和简单的生命形式被认为是微不足道的，因为细胞只是被“原生质”填满的，一种均质的果冻。达尔文在他的《物种起源》中提到的恩斯特·黑克尔，他相信最初的生命形式是一种细胞，将是“一个完全均质和无结构的物质，一种能够提供营养和繁殖的活性白蛋白颗粒。”[1]在达尔文生命的后期，科学家们发现了一种看起来是第一种原细胞的东西，并将其正式的科学名称命名为*Eozoon
    canadense*。达尔文在《物种起源》的第四版中将其作为第一个生命形式的候选者记录下来。当达尔文的朋友和拥护者托马斯·亨利·赫胥黎在海洋泥中发现了这种原型的时候，科学家们花了几年的时间收集海泥，寻找早期生命的证据。然而，他们很快发现，其中一个仅仅是由酒精和海水混合物产生的石灰化学沉淀物，而另一个是热和压力的产物。两者都不是有机的。[2]就像他的祖父一样，达尔文相信第一个生命形式的发现会很快发生。然而，尽管他最初充满热情，但生命起源的问题变得更加棘手。我们对生命最基本的组成部分了解得越多，情况就越复杂。要成为一个有机体，它需要繁殖，代谢能量，并且创建细胞壁。最基本的细胞

    The famous Miller-Urey experiments in 1953 created some of the amino acids found

    do show you can create some of the basic building blocks of life: amino acids,
    fatty acids, sugars, yet outside the cell, these building blocks do not join or
    enforce a specific chirality. In the cell, amino acids and sugars are sequestered
    to prevent the most likely activity, as pre-biotic chemistry generates melanoids
    and karogen which would stop any process.[3] The inevitable conclusion is that
    showing how a natural process can create a set of letters used in typesetting
    does not go far in showing how natural processes create words, let alone novels.[4] The

- en: 'Interestingly, the thing that happened to abiogenesis happened to the theory
    of evolution itself: the process is always just around the corner from some obvious
    demonstration.[5] Darwin wrote about the evolution of the first eye, and stated,
    “How a nerve comes to be sensitive to light hardly concerns us more than how life
    itself originated.” Indeed, it did not concern early enthusiasts of evolution,
    and still does not. When one is unconstrained by knowledge of a process or mechanism,
    it is easy to imagine that it is simple, although we know now that a light-sensitive
    spot is as specifically arranged as the eye itself at the molecular level.[6]
    Thus, the original stories about evolution simply assumed continual transformation.
    For example, when Darwin noted that black bears had been seen swimming with their
    mouths open for hours at a time on the surface of a lake, feeding on floating
    insects, he stated: “I can see no difficulty in a race of bears being rendered,
    by natural selection, more and more aquatic in their structure and habits, with
    larger and larger mouths, till a creature was produced as monstrous as a whale.”
    Imagining such a scenario is not a scientific argument, but simply speculation,
    and clearly a naive one.[7]Many present all evolution as similar to how wolves
    changed to sheepdogs, or the way in which bacteria develop resistance to penicillin,
    but such change will not create radically new protein complexes or new species.[8]
    Evolution was accepted as true—Darwin was buried at Westminster Abbey near Isaac
    Newton—before any of its advocates had any idea how genetics constrains evolutionary
    pathways, and blind faith in the theory has continued to this day. The problem
    is that natural selection can explain the survival of the fittest, but not how
    novel tissues arose, or the way in which amazingly precise and complicated biological
    processes developed. Some mechanism must exist to take the original life form
    to all life on Earth, which involves millions of new nucleotides within DNA that
    create proteins working in concert. Currently, most evolutionists consider the
    diversity of life and the fossil record prove this, but that is an inference based
    on their assumption it is the only way it could happen; in real-time looking at
    many thousands of generations of fruit flies and bacteria, we see only a handful
    of minor mutations.**From Deism to Christianity**If evolution is untrue, it changes
    everything. Something truly awesome created us, and created things have purposes,
    they are made “for” something, the way we make hammers to pound nails. We do not
    create our purpose, we discover it. As an atheist most of my life, I never cared
    about religious arguments, because I considered anything built on a faulty premise
    not worth discussing (unlike today’s atheists, who methinks protest too much).
    However, after I accepted that a creator exists, through some serendipity, I found
    myself attending church, engaging in Bible study, and reading Christian authors.
    I experienced a strange consilience, as various facts all began to make much more
    sense. The unique Christian focus on the heart is genius, and the priorities proposed
    in the New Testament work as if they were an instruction book from our creator. 
    Things that work as if they are true, are often really true. To be a Christian,
    you need faith, yet this faith can be completely, totally, rational. The science
    behind evolution is essential to understand why it is rational to believe in a
    creator, and psychology, neurology, and economics tell us about human nature and
    workable social arrangements. History is important, because there is a dialectic
    in scientific opinion, and so prior ideas were tenable before we had data that
    refuted them. Many good Christian ideas are not unique to Christianity, but a
    couple of significant ones are.In *The Blind Watchmaker*, Richard Dawkins wrote
    that Darwin made it possible to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist, in that
    prior to Darwin, atheists had no idea how life could have arisen without a designer.
    The tables are now turned, as recent scientific findings now make it possible
    to be an intellectually fulfilled theist.[9] A little knowledge led us away from
    God, and now a considerable amount of knowledge has led us back. There is no way
    a natural process created humans, and the habits of thought and action suggested
    in the New Testament are highly attuned to our natural instincts, fruitful character
    habits, and a prospering society.Unlike what the atheists say about God turning
    one off to science, it engaged me, because it is much more exciting to search
    for patterns if you think they exist objectively, rather than something I merely
    might be able to convince someone is important. The mathematician, Paul Erdos,
    used to become excited about determining not just mathematical proofs, but ones
    that were beautiful: inevitable, concise, and unexpected; these were the ones
    he assumed were in “The Book” God keeps for each mathematical theorem. If an intelligent
    designer creates objective reality, it is more, not less, interesting.Once one
    solves the basic problems of survival, the search for meaning is the essence of
    being human. In contrast, an animal’s goals are created by instincts, and thus,
    the Zen calmness of a resting dog does not reflect enlightenment, but simply that
    instincts restrict its purpose. Dogs, however, were bred from wolves to be human
    companions, and as a result, they now instinctively obey and love a good and loving
    human master, and respond to human cues in a way no other animals do. The serenity
    of a dog comes from following his purpose well.Alas, this requires the dog to
    have a good master, as if he finds himself with a bad one, he will suffer. Humans
    are allowed to choose their master, the thing they love most they orient their
    lives around. This ability to choose our purpose gives us great potential, whatever
    our circumstances, but also a responsibility that generates great anxiety. If
    we worship the wrong thing, we are like a dog with a bad master, destined to suffer;
    if we worship the right thing, we are like the dog with a good master, content,
    happy, active: high stakes indeed.Nietzsche wrote, “The why makes the how infinitely
    bearable,” in that we are primarily teleological beings. A strong purpose is calming,
    whereas no purpose generates angst, an uneasy fear of nothing in particular. People
    want to accomplish some good beyond themselves, and when we think our life connects
    us to something bigger than ourselves, something noble and beautiful and great
    that appreciates and returns our love, we are satisfied.The greatest eulogies
    of all time, Lincoln’s Gettysburg address and Pericles’s funeral oration, focused
    on showing how those who died did not do so in vain, as they helped create a prosperous
    and noble future that would be an example to the world. That gave those fallen
    soldiers’ lives meaning, as they were serving something bigger and nobler than
    themselves. We all wish to be eulogized in that way, as if our stay on this Earth
    was not in vain. We want something we esteem to appreciate us, not just now, but
    after we die. The existential philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre called it a “God-shaped
    hole” in our heart.'

  zh: 有趣的是，原始生命起源的事情也发生在进化论本身身上：这一过程总是在某种明显的演示附近。达尔文写道，关于第一只眼睛的进化，并声明：“神经如何对光敏感几乎不比生命本身的起源更让我们关心。”确实，这并不关注进化的早期热衷者，现在仍然如此。当一个人不受过程或机制知识的限制时，很容易想象它是简单的，尽管我们现在知道，光敏感斑点在分子水平上与眼睛本身一样具体安排。因此，关于进化的原始故事只是假设持续的转变。例如，当达尔文注意到黑熊曾经被看到在湖面上游泳，张着嘴巴吃浮游昆虫的时候，他说：“我看不出一群熊通过自然选择在结构和习性上变得越来越水生，嘴巴越来越大，直到产生了像鲸鱼一样巨大的生物，会有什么困难。”想象这样的情景并不是一个科学论证，而只是一种猜测，显然是一个天真的猜测。许多人将所有的进化都描述为类似于狼变成牧羊犬，或者细菌如何对青霉素产生抗性的方式，但是这种变化不会产生完全新的蛋白质复合物或新的物种。在了解任何进化途径受到遗传学约束之前，人们就已经接受了进化是真实的事实——达尔文被埋葬在了与艾萨克·牛顿相近的威斯敏斯特教堂——而且对理论的盲目信仰一直延续至今。问题在于自然选择可以解释适者生存，但无法解释新颖组织是如何产生的，或者复杂精密的生物过程是如何发展的。某种机制必须存在，将原始生命形式转变为地球上所有生命，这涉及DNA中数百万个新核苷酸，这些核苷酸产生共同工作的蛋白质。目前，大多数进化论者认为生命的多样性和化石记录证明了这一点，但这是基于他们的假设，认为这是唯一可能发生的方式；在实时观察成千上万代果蝇和细菌时，我们只看到了少数轻微的突变。**从自然神论到基督教**如果进化不真实，那就改变了一切。某种真正了不起的东西创造了我们，而被创造的事物有目的，它们被制造出来是“为了”某种目的，就像我们制造锤子来敲钉子一样。我们不创造我们的目的，我们发现它。作为一个大部分时间是无神论者，我从来不关心宗教争论，因为我认为建立在错误前提上的任何东西都不值得讨论（不像今天的无神论者，他们我认为过于强调）。然而，当我接受了一个造物主的存在，通过一些巧合，我发现自己去参加教堂，参加圣经研究，并阅读基督教作家的书籍。我经历了一种奇怪的协调，各种事实都开始变得更有意义。基督教对心灵的独特关注是天才的，新约提出的优先事项就像是来自我们创造者的一本指导书一样有效。那些像是真实的东西通常确实是真实的。成为一个基督徒，你需要信仰，但这种信仰可以完全、完全地理性。进化论背后的科学是理解为什么相信创造者是理性的重要部分，心理学、神经科学和经济学告诉我们有关人类本性和可行社会安排的信息。历史很重要，因为在科学观点中存在一种辩证法，所以在我们有数据反驳之前，以前的想法是可行的。许多好的基督教思想并不是基督教所独有的，但有一些重要的是。在《盲目的表演者》中，理查德·道金斯写道，达尔文使成为一个智慧充实的无神论者成为可能，因为在达尔文之前，无神论者不知道生命如何在没有设计者的情况下产生。现在情况正好相反，因为最近的科学发现现在使成为一个智慧充实的有神论者成为可能。一点知识使我们远离上帝，现在大量的知识使我们回到了上帝的面前。没有自然过程可以创造人类，而新约中所建议的思想和行为习惯与我们的自然本能、有益的品格习

    drive to find meaning and purpose, because it is more likely that we have an objective
    purpose that gives our lives meaning. Love is the only end in itself, and the
    love of God is the key to any Christian purpose, the ultimate motivator because,
    as the creator of the universe, you can be sure that He will always be there.
    Profound truths should help you prosper, and to the extent that a worldview is
    based on an incorrect view of human nature or society, daily refutation generates
    angst. The most profound truth is that some being created us, and that created
    things have a purpose. Our purpose is hard-wired into our biology, and creates
    a longing to love something greater than ourselves, and following this simple
    purpose generates a social optimum via invisible hand. Having one grand objective

    its citizens, which, in turn, would cause humans to flourish. Christianity is
    consistent with this, because its bottom-up focus encourages decentralized decision-making
    and individual liberty. Christianity neither legislates nor demands virtue; it
    merely encourages it as part of a loving relationship with God. By making people
    sublimate their will to that of Jesus Christ, who represents God on Earth, one
    becomes more humble, a better spouse, parent, colleague, and friend. The modesty
    that comes from Christianity is not weakness, but rather, a combination of honesty
    and intelligence.The Roman Emperor and Stoic philosopher Marcus Aurelius wrote,
    “A man’s greatness lies in the consciousness of an honest purpose in life, founded
    on a just estimate of himself and everything else, on frequent self-examination,
    and a steady obedience to the rule which he knows to be right.”[10] Epictetus
    (another Roman Stoic) noted that if you want to be good, assume you are bad, which
    is consistent with the Christian concept of original sin. Christianity in many
    ways represents Classical virtues with a radically different motive that actually
    is inspiring (it is not trivial that Nietzsche called Christianity “Platonism
    for the masses”).[11]All major faiths both sublimate the self to something external,
    but also concentrate on managing and disciplining the self. We have hard-wired
    emotional responses and we know that Aaron Beck’s Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
    is useful in disciplining these deep drives. The focus is on repairing oneself,
    not others: changing unhelpful or inaccurate thinking, problematic behavior, and
    distressing emotional responses. This makes us prosperous and happy. While status
    is a function of talent, effort, and luck, for those of us in developed countries,
    a small amount of effort affords one more than enough food and shelter to live,
    and everything most valuable to us, our integrity, purpose, and relationships,
    are all free. If you and your friends judge each other according to the heart,
    and not cleverness or status, it is completely possible to have a wholly satisfying
    life, regardless of the luck or innate ability that we cannot control.Only Christianity
    is motivated by love of a personal God, and achieving the right will is key to
    a good purpose. Jesus not only serves as a bridge for humans to achieve salvation,
    His personal nature makes it easier for humans to love Him—and thus, by extension,
    God—and His sacrifice highlights the fact that God loves us: if God paid no price
    for us, it would be difficult to believe that He cares. This esoteric aspect of
    what Jesus represents, functionally, is necessary when you are trying to appeal
    to a large group, as Christianity does. The righteous conduct God praises is consistent
    with the timeless virtues, including such perennials as to know thyself, the golden
    rule, and an appreciation of the moral equivalence of all men.[12]'

  zh: 亚里士多德教导说，国家的目的是鼓励其公民的美德，这反过来会使人类蓬勃发展。基督教与此一致，因为它的自下而上的关注鼓励分权决策和个人自由。基督教既不立法也不要求美德；它只是鼓励它作为与上帝的爱的一部分。通过使人们将自己的意志升华为耶稣基督的意志，耶稣基督代表了地上的上帝，一个人会变得更加谦虚，成为更好的配偶、父母、同事和朋友。基督教带来的谦逊不是软弱，而是诚实和智慧的结合。罗马皇帝和斯多葛派哲学家马库斯·奥勒留写道：“一个人的伟大在于对生命中诚实目标的认识，这个目标建立在对自己和一切其他事物的公正评估之上，建立在经常的自我审查和对他知道是正确的规则的坚定服从之上。”[10]
    埃比克泰德（另一位罗马斯多葛派）指出，如果你想成为好人，就假设你是坏人，这与基督教原罪的概念一致。在许多方面，基督教代表了古典美德，但其动机却完全不同，这实际上是鼓舞人心的（尼采称基督教为“大众的柏拉图主义”并非无的放矢）[11]
    所有主要信仰都将自我升华为外在的事物，但同时也专注于管理和调理自我。我们的情感反应是内在的，我们知道阿伦·贝克的认知行为疗法对调节这些深层驱动力很有用。重点是修复自己，而不是别人：改变不利或不准确的思维，有问题的行为和令人烦恼的情感反应。这使我们繁荣和幸福。虽然地位是才能、努力和运气的功能，但对于我们发达国家的人来说，少量的努力足以提供足够的食物和住所，以及我们最看重的一切，我们的诚信、目的和关系，这一切都是免费的。如果你和你的朋友根据内心而不是聪明或地位来评判彼此，那么无论我们无法控制的运气或天生的能力如何，都完全可能过上完全令人满意的生活。唯有基督教是出于对个人上帝的爱而激励的，并且实现正确意志是一个良好目的的关键。耶稣不仅作为人类实现救赎的桥梁，他的个人本性使人类更容易爱他——因此，间接地，爱上帝——他的牺牲突显了上帝爱我们的事实：如果上帝没有为我们付出代价，那么相信他关心我们就很困难。这种耶稣所代表的神秘方面，在试图吸引大群体的时候是必要的，正如基督教所做的那样。上帝赞扬的正直行为与永恒美德一致，包括了解自己、黄金法则以及对所有人的道德等同的欣赏[12]
- en: A Christian purpose aligns with our nature so well that it is useful to believe
    and behave “as if” it were true, and in the history of science, many assumptions
    that were chosen because they worked were later found to be true. Thus, assumptions
    often are used as contrivances, what Milton Friedman called “as if” assumptions
    that are not necessarily true, but just good working assumptions. For example,
    if you assume that individuals are self-interested you can explain many things
    that are otherwise difficult to explain. When Adam Smith introduced this in 1776,
    it seemed almost Machiavellian, but it turned out to be a better first-order approximation
    of individual motivation than any other. It is a miracle that Christianity promotes
    a societal arrangement as counterintuitive as the free market a couple thousand
    years before theory and data made this clear. Even in the 1950’s most educated
    economists thought socialism was more productive than capitalism.

  zh: 基督教的目的与我们的本性非常契合，以至于认为并行为“仿佛”它是真的是有用的，在科学史上，许多被选择因为它们有效的假设后来被证明是真实的。因此，假设经常被用作假设，即米尔顿·弗里德曼称之为“仿佛”假设，这些假设不一定是真实的，但只是很好的工作假设。例如，如果你假设个体是自私的，你可以解释很多其他难以解释的事情。当亚当·斯密在1776年引入这一点时，它似乎几乎是马基雅维利的，但后来证明这是对个体动机的更好的一阶近似。令人惊奇的是，基督教在数千年前就促进了一个社会安排，这个安排与自由市场一样反直觉，而在理论和数据清晰之前，这一点并不明显。即使在1950年代，大多数受过教育的经济学家也认为社会主义比资本主义更具生产力。
- en: When the positron and wave-particle duality were both introduced first via “as
    if” arguments, they emerged from the mathematics used to describe quantum events,
    “as if” they existed; later, they were found to exist. Scientists believe that
    dark matter exists because, as happens in our solar system, spiral galaxies move
    “as if” embedded in some form of translucent matter that keeps the innermost stars
    from moving much faster than the outermost stars. No one has seen dark matter,
    only its effects, but scientists are certain it exists because the cosmos move
    “as if” it does.

- en: If you focus first on yourself, next on your family, and then on your neighbors
    and colleagues, your focus forms a concentric circle based on their proximity.
    If you focus first on the neediest, that causes your focus to leapfrog out of
    this concentric circle to groups external to your circle of friends and family.
    On a purely utilitarian basis, the latter approach seems to dominate because it
    provides more for those who need it most. Yet the leapfrogging focus demands one
    truly care about abstract people as much as people one knows intimately, which
    is counter to our human nature, as the neurotransmitters that underlie pair-bonding
    are activated by physical contact.[13] You also need to understand these people,
    their motives, monitor them like a close friend, etc., all of which is simply
    impossible. Thus, big top-down programs to help some impoverished group merely
    increases their number and does not bring forth prosperity or gratitude. Focusing
    on those in your immediate circle, including yourself, has the advantage of working,
    though it requires a great deal of humility and faith that this focus is aligned
    with a greater good. It is the serenity prayer in action.

  zh: 如果你首先关注自己，然后关注你的家人，再关注你的邻居和同事，你的关注将形成一个以他们的亲近程度为基础的同心圆。如果你首先关注最需要帮助的人，那么你的关注就会跳出这个同心圆，转向你的朋友和家人圈子之外的群体。从纯粹的功利角度来看，后一种方法似乎更占优势，因为它为最需要帮助的人提供了更多。然而，跳跃性的关注要求一个人真正关心抽象的人，就像关心亲密的人一样，这与我们的人性相悖，因为支撑配对的神经递质是由身体接触激活的。你还需要了解这些人，了解他们的动机，像亲密的朋友一样监视他们等等，所有这些都是不可能的。因此，帮助一些贫困群体的大型自上而下的项目只会增加他们的数量，而不会带来繁荣或感激。关注你的直接圈子中的人，包括你自己，在于其有利于奏效，尽管这需要极大的谦卑和相信这种关注与更大的善的一致性。这就是恳求平静的实践。
- en: The very best thing that people can do for the whole world is to make the most
    of themselves and those close to them. This is why the Axial age religions have
    provided so many with good guidance, for example, focusing on mundane virtues,
    because a society prospers according to the virtues of its citizens, in which
    they take responsibility for themselves. Your attitude towards yourself is paramount
    because we really love our neighbor as ourselves; we do unto others as we do unto
    ourselves. Forgiveness, tolerance, sacrifice, if not practiced towards oneself,
    are just words. It should be remembered those without any self-interest find it
    much easier to be cruel when acting selflessly. If you don't value yourself highly,
    how can you value other selves highly (e.g., ants are selfless animals, yet they
    are also the most warlike and take slaves)?The progressive inspired ‘positive’
    rights for healthcare, food, education, and housing, are claims on the resources
    of others backed by coercive bureaucracies. Top-down charity is helpful in a pinch,
    but as a prolonged policy it is counterproductive and resented. That is, Ben Franklin
    noted that if you want someone to like you, ask them for a small favor, it shows
    you appreciate their talents; if you merely give them things, people find it patronizing
    (they think you are incapable) or a sign of guilt (which means, you probably took
    more than you are giving). Goods and services received without a struggle—and
    the sense of insecurity that motivates it—leads to resentment, and this leads
    to a vicious circle of hating the 1% even more; those most in need of help neglect
    the person who can help them most, themselves.

  zh: 人们为整个世界做的最好的事情就是充分发挥自己和亲近的人的潜力。这就是为什么轴心时代的宗教为许多人提供了良好的指导，例如，专注于世俗美德，因为一个社会的繁荣取决于其公民的美德，他们为自己负责。你对自己的态度至关重要，因为我们真的爱我们的邻居如同爱自己一样；我们对待别人的方式如同我们对待自己一样。宽恕、宽容、牺牲，如果不是向自己实践，那就只是空洞的话。应该记住，那些没有任何自私兴趣的人在无私行为时更容易变得残酷。如果你不高度重视自己，你怎么能高度重视其他自我（例如，蚂蚁是无私的动物，但它们也是最好战的，会掳掠奴隶）？受进步主义启发的“积极”权利，如医疗保健、食品、教育和住房，是对他人资源的索取，由强制性的官僚机构支持。自上而下的慈善在紧要关头是有帮助的，但作为长期政策，这是适得其反的，并且会招致反感。也就是说，本·富兰克林指出，如果你想让别人喜欢你，向他们请求一个小小的帮助，这表明你欣赏他们的才华；如果你仅仅给他们东西，人们会觉得你是在施舍（他们认为你无能）或者是一种负罪感的表现（这意味着，你可能拿了比你给出的更多）。没有经历挣扎得到的商品和服务——以及激发这种挣扎的不安全感——会导致怨恨，这会导致更加憎恨1％的人；那些最需要帮助的人却忽视了那些最能帮助他们的人，也就是自己。
- en: The Bible is prescient in orienting an individual’s focus in concentric circles
    from him/herself, to family, etc., all the while avoiding the emptiness of doing
    it merely for oneself. The first thing a Christian must do is fear, obey, and
    love God. As God does not speak directly to most people, this means making yourself
    a better person, not out of narcissism, but rather, in order to look better to
    someone beautiful who loves you. In contrast, Freudian psychoanalysis centers
    on fixing oneself for oneself by getting rid of unconscious repressions that often
    were attributed to religion. This kind of thinking failed because that focus did
    not soothe, but inflamed us, as the more we thought about ourselves, the more
    we thought about how others had wronged us. The motivation, the heart, is key.

  zh: 圣经在定位个人关注点时具有先见之明，从自我开始向同心圆中转移，直至家庭等，始终避免了仅仅为自己而做的空虚。一个基督徒必须做的第一件事是敬畏、顺服和爱上帝。由于上帝并不直接对大多数人说话，这意味着让自己变得更好，不是出于自恋，而是为了让一个爱你的美丽之人看到你更好。相比之下，弗洛伊德的精神分析集中于为了自己而改造自己，摆脱常常被归因于宗教的无意识压抑。这种思维方式失败了，因为这种关注并没有使我们平静，反而激起了我们，因为我们越想着自己，就越想着别人是如何对我们不公的。动机，即内心，是关键。
