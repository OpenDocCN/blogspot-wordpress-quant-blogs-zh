- en: Joshua Brown at [The Reformed Broker](http://thereformedbroker.com/) has a nice
    piece out this morning (hat tip, [Trader Mike](http://tradermike.net/)) with the
    playful title of [The Five Stages of Panic Buying](http://thereformedbroker.com/2009/08/27/the-five-stages-of-panic-buying/).
    Brown illustrates each of the five stages with quotes from through the investment
    management world and in so doing has reconstructed something of a psychological
    history of the current bull market. Both bulls and bears are encouraged to click
    through to get a chuckle out of what has been going on in the head of investors
    for the past 5-6 months.

- en: The underlying theme of all five stages is that on Wall Street, where annual
    bonuses are typically doled out based on performance relative to a benchmark,
    investment managers loathe the idea of falling behind that benchmark early in
    the year and having to play catch-up for the balance of the year. Particularly
    in a year when the market starts down then reverses sharply to the upside, one
    would expect that a large majority of investment managers would find themselves
    chasing performance, becoming more aggressive and taking on more risk in order
    to reel in the benchmark.

    favors the use of more derivatives, more leverage, more beta and less cash. It
    shows up on charts as aggressive buying on the dip, the failure of stocks to retrace
    earlier gains, etc. and is part of the reason why the 10 day [rate of change](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/rate%20of%20change)
    (ROC) in the chart below has yet to fall below -5 (%) since the rally began.

    likely to lead to crowded trades and ultimately to panic selling. There have not
    been many days in which we have seen big drops in the SPX and there has certainly
    been no extended weakness in stocks since the March bottom, but I suspect that
    when the market finally does turn, those same panic buyers will be quick to lock
    in gains in hopes of keeping pace with or finally overtaking the appropriate benchmark.

    positions of questionable underlying value, then the potential for some high volatility
    trading in the next month or so may be higher than recent stock market activity
    has led many to believe.
