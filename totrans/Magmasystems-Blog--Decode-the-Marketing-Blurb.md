# Magmasystems Blog: Decode the Marketing Blurb

> 来源：[http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2006/09/decode-marketing-blurb.html#0001-01-01](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2006/09/decode-marketing-blurb.html#0001-01-01)

Here is a fun game for all of you. A certain vendor sells decision systems over a bunch of vertical industries. Here is a blurb from one of their webpages that outlines their offerings for the financial industry:

**Modeling: Price and Risk Models** *We model the equity market as an open, irreversible, far from equilibrium thermodynamic model subject to dynamic constraints. This approach results in a bi-linear model composed of two dynamical sub-models: price evolution and risk evolution. The price evolution sub-model represents the behavior of pricing of commodities and a market aggregate as a function of exogenous demand and control actions. The risk sub-model represents the behavior of risk as a function of exogenous uncertainty and actions. Further, the risk sub-model represents the uncertainty range of the values computed by the price evolution model.*

The game here is to decode the blurb and tell me what this system does.
