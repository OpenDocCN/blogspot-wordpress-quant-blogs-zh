    Chartered Financial Analyst meeting unless they stopped teaching Modern Portfolio
    Theory. They did not, so he withheld his eminence. Now, first, this is an absurd
    request, and I'm no fan of the CAPM. Second, Taleb argues MPT, including the CAPM,
    is worse than useless. Yet Peter Bernstein wrote a nice blurb on his book! Bernstein
    wrote a couple hagiographies of the founders of the Modern Portfolio Theory (

    of the recent crisis, is simply stupid, and highlights that he does not understand
    how strategic decisions are made in large organizations. VaR had nothing to do
    with the subprime crisis, it has a very limited area of application, and strategic
    decisions are not one of them. Just as 'risk managers' do not okay acquisitions,
    risk managers do not okay strategy, they merely make sure the rules are being
    followed, in part by using a Value at Risk. That VaR might have been used to validate
    investing in mortgages (UBS had some poor Value-at-Risk numbers underlying their
    mortgage exposures), does not mean it was a critical driver. The decision, really
    the assumption, was widely held that default risk on mortgages was a trivial risk
    because the US had not had an aggregate decline in housing since WW2\. Everything
