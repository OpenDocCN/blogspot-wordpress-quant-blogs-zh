    to stimulate should signs of weakness appear. However, it did also indicate that
    tightening is not around the corner.

    end of the yield curve to inject or withdraw liquidity from the market. Now the
    Bernanke has began to use "unconventional" measures to intervene in the long end
    of the curve. There has been a lot of discussion and hand wringing at the Fed
    about why housing didn't respond well to these stimulus measures. Indeed, there

    announcements to "clarify" its statements. Watch for further statements in the
    days to come to see the Fed's reaction to the backup in bond yields. On the other
    hand, if there is no comment within the next couple of weeks, then I would interpret
    the silence as a signal that the central bank is comfortable with a rise in bond
    yields.
