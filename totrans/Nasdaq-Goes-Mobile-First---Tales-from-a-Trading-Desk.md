# Nasdaq Goes Mobile First | Tales from a Trading Desk

## Nasdaq Goes Mobile First

Interesting [read](http://www.wallstreetandtech.com/it-infrastructure/user-experience-is-driving-changes-to-na/240166115) over on Wall Street & Technology, “User Experience is Driving Changes to Nasdaq’s Corporate Solution Platform”.

> Our design focus for that platforms starts with mobile and works its way back to the website. That’s a key and obvious trend.

Given the platform Nasdaq are building, its probably the most sensible [perspective](http://econsultancy.com/blog/64331-thinking-mobile-first-think-again).  All to often companies treat mobile as just an extension of the browser desktop, whereas in reality it should be view somewhat differently to ensure maximum benefit is achieved.

Predictive Analytics is also called out – no surprise.
