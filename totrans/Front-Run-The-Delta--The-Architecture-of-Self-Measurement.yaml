- en: I first read this book way back in middle school – and there is a point to all
    this, so bear with me. I then re-read it, borrowing it from a friend out of sheer
    desperation for anything published in English, living abroad for the first time
    about ten years ago – and I was genuinely stunned to find that the book said literally
    the *exact opposite* of what I'd remembered it saying. It was like being confronted
    with a distorting mirror, or an old set of photographs – a very visceral, even
    embarrassing, way of realizing how much a person might change. Given time, how
    different are your sources of significance.

    outside your normal sphere of experience, and you'd visit it every few years.
    [...] You show up; you've set the whole day aside, like going to see a very long
    film. Or running a marathon. And you proceed to ride the elevators and escalators.
    You sit down at certain windows. You stand there in the corner just looking around.
    You go into rooms you once knew.

    investing as well. And I mean investing as a whole universe of opportunity: beginning
    with amateur knowledge of mutual funds and bonds, moving to equities; exploring
    derivatives, commodities, forex, and then on to advanced strategies of spreads,
    arbitrage, Black-Scholes; venture capital, private placements, real estate, etc.
    etc.'

    and condors, and reading the greeks just become second nature. You force yourself
    to develope and trade on new strategies, new analysis, new products.
