    an index reconstitution the deleted stocks outperformed their replacements by
    an average of 9.3 percentage points. The NYTimes article states that in the five
    years after reconstitution, the difference was 40.1 percentage points. This pattern
    was quite consistent. In 20 of the 25 years studied, the average deleted stock
    was ahead of the average replacement after 12 months.

    to benchmarks, people often replicate the benchmark's changes. An obvious question
    is, do all the benchmark adjustments help the Sharpe ratio, or merely help track
    the benchmark better? It appears the answer is there is a trade-off in the benchmark
    tracking error with returns, both in raw returns, and from the additional costs
    from extra transactions. Another issue is, what is the driver of this result?
    Is it, the overshooting by those targeting benchmarks, that then shows up later
    as a correction? A more fundamental effect would be firms added to the benchmark
    have obviously had a recent run of good returns, which may make them overconfident,
    leading to poor decisions; in contrast, deleted firms are chastened, and make
    salubrious changes to their strategy or management team.

    temporary effect from being added to the index has changed a lot in the past few
    years. In that sense, it''s like so many financial market anomalies: by the time
    academics find it, it is merely history. I remember around 2003, the investment
    banks were big on selling the following trade: sell stocks about to be removed
    from the indices, buy stocks about to be added to the indices. This was a short
    term trade, meant to capitalize on the 1 or 2 week boost that resulted from firms
    that passively benchmarked the S&P500 or some other index, front running these
    predictable trades (using the rules used by indexes, you could pretty well anticipate
    their add/deletes). But that year the effect seemed to reverse itself, and so,
    the following year, several investment banks suggested you ''Chinese'' the trade,
    going short adds, and long deletes, anticipating the hedge funds anticipating
    the long-only funds. The effect of index add/deletes is now a muddle.'

    what is, or was, anticipated by the initial index change. But I think the index
    add phenomenon highlights an important point. If more than one investment bank
    try to sell you on a trade idea, you can be pretty sure it will not work. If all
    of Deutsche Banks clients see the strategy, too many people see it. Further, Deutsche
    Bank themselves see the strategy as more value in generating commissions than
    trading directly, that's not very interesting.

  zh: 但再次，他们确实发现了一个相当大的累积效应，远远超过了最初指数变化所预期的大小。但我认为指数增加现象凸显了一个重要的观点。如果超过一个投资银行试图向你推销一个交易理念，你可以相当肯定它不会奏效。如果德意志银行的所有客户都看到了这个策略，那么太多人看到了它。此外，德意志银行本身认为这个策略在产生佣金方面比直接交易更有价值，这并不十分有趣。
