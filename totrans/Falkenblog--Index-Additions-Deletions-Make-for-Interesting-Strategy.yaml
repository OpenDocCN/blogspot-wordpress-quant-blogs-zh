- en: ”. Focusing on the Russell 2000 index they found that over the 12 months after
    an index reconstitution the deleted stocks outperformed their replacements by
    an average of 9.3 percentage points. The NYTimes article states that in the five
    years after reconstitution, the difference was 40.1 percentage points. This pattern
    was quite consistent. In 20 of the 25 years studied, the average deleted stock
    was ahead of the average replacement after 12 months.

- en: This is interesting for several reasons. First, because many investors compare
    to benchmarks, people often replicate the benchmark's changes. An obvious question
    is, do all the benchmark adjustments help the Sharpe ratio, or merely help track
    the benchmark better? It appears the answer is there is a trade-off in the benchmark
    tracking error with returns, both in raw returns, and from the additional costs
    from extra transactions. Another issue is, what is the driver of this result?
    Is it, the overshooting by those targeting benchmarks, that then shows up later
    as a correction? A more fundamental effect would be firms added to the benchmark
    have obviously had a recent run of good returns, which may make them overconfident,
    leading to poor decisions; in contrast, deleted firms are chastened, and make
    salubrious changes to their strategy or management team.

  zh: 几个原因使这一现象很有趣。首先，因为许多投资者与基准进行比较，人们经常复制基准的变化。一个明显的问题是，所有基准的调整都有助于夏普比率，还是只是有助于更好地跟踪基准？似乎答案是在带来额外交易成本的同时，基准跟踪误差和回报之间存在一种折衷。另一个问题是，这个结果的驱动力是什么？是那些针对基准的过度追踪一时期，随后作为一种纠正而出现的超调吗？更基本的效应则是被加入基准的公司显然有了最近的良好回报，这可能会让他们过于自信，导致糟糕的决策；而被删除的公司则被惩罚，并对其战略或管理团队做出有益的改变。
- en: 'I''m a bit skeptical of the current relevance of this finding, given that the
    temporary effect from being added to the index has changed a lot in the past few
    years. In that sense, it''s like so many financial market anomalies: by the time
    academics find it, it is merely history. I remember around 2003, the investment
    banks were big on selling the following trade: sell stocks about to be removed
    from the indices, buy stocks about to be added to the indices. This was a short
    term trade, meant to capitalize on the 1 or 2 week boost that resulted from firms
    that passively benchmarked the S&P500 or some other index, front running these
    predictable trades (using the rules used by indexes, you could pretty well anticipate
    their add/deletes). But that year the effect seemed to reverse itself, and so,
    the following year, several investment banks suggested you ''Chinese'' the trade,
    going short adds, and long deletes, anticipating the hedge funds anticipating
    the long-only funds. The effect of index add/deletes is now a muddle.'

  zh: 我对这一发现的当前相关性有些怀疑，考虑到被加入指数的临时影响在过去几年里发生了很大变化。从这个意义上讲，这就像许多金融市场异常一样：当学术界发现它时，它只是历史了。我记得大约在2003年，投资银行大力推销以下交易：卖出即将被从指数中删除的股票，买入即将被加入指数的股票。这是一个短期交易，意在利用那些被动跟踪标普500或其他指数的公司通过提前做出可预见的交易（通过指数使用的规则，你可以相当准确地预期它们的增/减）。但那年这个效果似乎出现了反转，因此，次年，几家投资银行建议你“中国式”这种交易，卖空增加，买入删除，预期对冲基金预期只做多头交易的基金。指数增/减成分的效果现在是一团糟。
- en: Then again, they do find a rather large cumulative effect, much bigger than
    what is, or was, anticipated by the initial index change. But I think the index
    add phenomenon highlights an important point. If more than one investment bank
    try to sell you on a trade idea, you can be pretty sure it will not work. If all
    of Deutsche Banks clients see the strategy, too many people see it. Further, Deutsche
    Bank themselves see the strategy as more value in generating commissions than
    trading directly, that's not very interesting.

  zh: 但再次，他们确实发现了一个相当大的累积效应，远远超过了最初指数变化所预期的大小。但我认为指数增加现象凸显了一个重要的观点。如果超过一个投资银行试图向你推销一个交易理念，你可以相当肯定它不会奏效。如果德意志银行的所有客户都看到了这个策略，那么太多人看到了它。此外，德意志银行本身认为这个策略在产生佣金方面比直接交易更有价值，这并不十分有趣。
