    [Revisiting the Flight-to-Safety Trade](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/06/revisiting-flight-to-safety-trade.html).
    In thinking about various flight-to-safety low risk havens I tend to focus on
    U.S. Treasuries, the dollar ([UUP](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/UUP))
    and gold ([GLD](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/GLD)).

    at is the risk trade. There are many ways to think about the risk trade (growth
    vs. value, emerging markets vs. developed markets, consumer discretionary vs.
    consumer staples, etc.) but for a broad and simplified perspective on the risk
    trade I like to focus on market capitalization. Specifically, I like to follow
    the ratio of the small cap Russell 2000 index ([RUT](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/RUT))
    to the mega cap S&P 100 index ([OEX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/OEX)).

    below shows the RUT relative to the OEX (black line) since May 2008, with a gray
    area chart of the S&P 500 index added for context. Also included in the chart
    are [Bollinger Bands](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Bollinger%20bands)
    that use customized settings of 30 days and 1.5 standard deviations (for more
    information on using something other than the default 20 days and 2.0 standard
    deviations, see the links below.) The result is a chart that tells me when the
    [RUT:OEX ratio](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/RUT%3AOEX%20ratio)
    is high in absolute terms or relative to recent values.

    in [The Elusive Trading Range](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/06/elusive-trading-range.html)),
    then investors should be thinking about transitioning from indicators that measure
    trend strength to indicators such as oscillators that measure how much various
    asset classes are overbought oversold.

    opportunities in either trending or trendless markets it to look at various proxies
    for the risk trade. For me at least, a good place to start is the RUT:OEX ratio
    and lately that ratio has done a solid job of identifying overbought and oversold
    conditions in stocks.
