    premise is that financial economists, and investors, systematically neglect improbable
    events. The result is that out-of-the-money options, especially qualitative analogues
    like unconventional investment ideas picked up at cocktail parties, offer the
    best reward-to-risk ratio. Let's consider these.

    than merely buying out-of-the-money options in that it also takes advantage of
    'behavioral biases'. Now, as 'prospect theory' implies people ignore, or overweight,
    improbable events, such 'behavioral biases' allow a strategy a great deal of latitude.
    In practice simple ideas, such as the underpricing of out-of-the-money options
    is too simple to sell, so the vendor feels compelled to confabulate a pretentious
    but useless tweak. In this case, that just means one sells in-the-money options
    to lighten the expense (more gamma, less vega). Do the math, and this strategy
    simply shifts your payoff distribution so it has a funky nonlinearity, shifting
    returns from the [-10%,0] space to the [-∞,-10%] and [0,∞] space, but the same
    expected return. That is, say you buy $2 worth of out of the money put options,
    and offset this a little by selling $1 worth of in-the-money put options. This
    means you still hit a home run in the extreme event like 2008 (which was, statistically,
    improbable); you make less in the more probable adverse event; you lose less if
    the market rises. As empirical studies have found option returns to decrease as
    one goes out of the money (see

    bias this is leveraging is a marketing one. Considering that out-of-the-money
    options are most overpriced, this is a bad strategy.

    I doubt it. That is, much was made of the "65% to 115%" return reported in October
    of some Black Swan Funds (see WSJ

    It would be interesting to know the subsequent returns, but everyone merely quotes
    the hearsay (always, 'a person close to the fund reported...') reported on their
    top tic. As Taleb is insistent that too many investors naively chase last year's
    winners, it would only be consistent to not make too much of one year's returns.
    Indeed, Empirica Kurtosis, his earlier hedge fund, also started out with a

    USD to his favorite charity if he sends me audited financials showing the cumulative
    Sharpe ratio of Empirica Kurtosis LLP over its lifetime was greater than 0.5 (which
    is a poor hedge fund return, consistent with exit), and the offer still stands.
    Thus, over the long run, not a sequence of 2008s, this is a crappy strategy.

    hate being naked low-delta options. You don't have to buy too many to move the
    price, implying market impact is high. This makes these strategies even more expensive
    than any simulation when done in size. That doesn't bode well for these now-popular
    strategies.
