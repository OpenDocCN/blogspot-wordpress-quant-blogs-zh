    I thought it would be fun to analyze Twitter use of #cfa12 during the [CFA Institute
    65th Annual Conference](http://www.cfainstitute.org/learning/products/events/Pages/05062012_52432.aspx)
    in Chicago last week.  At last year’s conference, there was virtually no tweeting,
    so I was amazed at the exponential growth in tweeting this year and also at the
    number of lit screens during each session.'

    to facet tweet activity by day with the hour of the day as the x-axis.  If anyone
    accomplishes this, I would love to see it.
