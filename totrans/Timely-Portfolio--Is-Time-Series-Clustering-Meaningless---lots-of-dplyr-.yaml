    discussing or arguing time series clustering.  After reading the paper a couple
    of times, I think I understand their points, and I do not think what I am doing
    is “meaningless”.  In their financial time series examples, they use prices and
    speak of trying to find patterns.  I simply want to classify which years are most
    alike by various characteristics, such as autocorrelation of **returns**  not
    prices, distribution of returns, and all sorts of other classifiers.

    deeper.  Iongtime readers might be wondering where are the interactive plots. 
    I wanted to share what I have done so far hoping that readers might elaborate,
    argue, or point me in good directions.

    and piping that I used to generate the results.  Also, I have not seen dplyr `do`
    applied to autocorrelation `ACF`, so you might want to check that out in the last
    snippet of code.
