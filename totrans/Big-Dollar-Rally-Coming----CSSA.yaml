    2008 in a similar situation before rebounding. Likely the short-covering in the
    euro has helped exacerbate this situation. Since the euro is in very deep trouble,
    and in a steep downtrend I see this euro rally/dollar decline as a temporary respite.

- en: 3) The dollar has a negative correlation with the stock market because it is
    a carry trade/risk trade where speculators borrow in dollars to risk capital in
    other assets. Currently the spring/summer correction in the stock market found
    a temporary bottom and margin calls to speculators to re-patriate dollars are
    falling. Since the market is highly stretched to the upside in the short-term
    and is in a long-term downtrend with mixed probabilities in the intermediate term,
    the dollar has plenty of scenarios where it could stage a rally.

    poor credit conditions favor bonds. The primary goldbug thesis for the dollar
    going down was the risk of inflation/debasement via excessive money creation.
     Bonds are technically bullish which confirms a perceived deflationary threat
    (see AGG for a pretty chart). Buyers of bonds internationally drive demand for
    dollars. Gold in contrast looks weak in the short-term at new highs and may not
    be as appealing to hedge fund managers since they likely buy into the goldbug
    thesis concerning the dollar. Gold is over-owned within the hedge fund community
    and could spontaneously correct several hundred dollars on a liquidation. Gold
    is often inversely correlated with the dollar, but is currently sitting near a
    peak in positive correlation (correlations are often mean-reverting in the intermediate
    term). An unwind of major gold positions could spark a rally in the dollar.'

    This favors the current condition of being deeply oversold in an up-trend.

    a successful trade will probably work within 5-10 days.
