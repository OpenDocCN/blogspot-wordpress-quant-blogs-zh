    can only be understood by recognizing that the dragon's arrival resulted in a
    severe monetary shock. On the left is shown Smaug's hoard. On the right, for purposes
    of comparison, are the gold reserves of the Bank of England. ***It is clear from
    a simple inspection of these two figures that the amount of gold coinage Smaug
    withdrew from circulation represents a significant volume of currency. This would,
    inevitably, lead to deflation and depressed economic activity.***

    = MV), if you withdraw money supply from the system, lower economic activity would
    be the result. The question then becomes what the proper response if Middle Earth
    had a central bank using a more flexible monetary system using fiat money would
    be in the face of such a macroeconomic shock:'

    have ameliorated the impacts of the dragon-induced economic downturn. If ***the
    peoples of Middle Earth had abandoned their gold specie standard, and switched
    instead to a paper currency, they could have revived trade-flows without sacrificing
    so many lives.*** Unfortunately, the lack of a central bank, or indeed any but
    the most rudimentary monetary institutions, was a major obstacle to currency reform.

    Hobbit" takes place, would not price rigidities have resolved themselves and economic
    production returned to pre-Smaug levels?

    year after year, perhaps the money supply was continually decreasing. Fully downwardly
    rigid nominal prices (like for debt, or if social standards hadn't adjusted, for
    wages) could then prevent economic adjustment.

    would be very sticky at all in a feudal economy. The two stickiest prices, wages
    and debts, probably didn't exist. Most workers are subsistence farm owners and
    are not paid wages. The financial system is negligible - if it even exists - making
    debt contracts rare. While there certainly could be some sticky prices, those
    are adjusted over time with much more ease than wages or debts, no?

    all his real effects would be through the "fiscal policy" you mention.
