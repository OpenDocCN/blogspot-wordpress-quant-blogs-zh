    CBOE. Today was potentially a big one, with the launch of futures on the Nasdaq-100
    Volatility Index, which most of us simply refer to as [VXN](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXN)
    or Vixen.

    of the volatility index futures at the CBOE Futures Exchange ([CFE](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/CFE)).
    Today VXN futures ([VN](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VN)) traded
    20 contracts on its opening day. While futures in the CBOE Emerging Markets ETF
    Volatility Index ([VXEEM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXEEM))
    are currently positioned at the #2 product at the CFE, VXN futures certainly have
    a lot of potential, with the likes of Apple ([AAPL](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/AAPL)),
    Facebook ([FB](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/FB)) and Google ([GOOG](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/GOOG))
    and other technology high fliers folded into this security.'

    article, The Expanding Volatility Megaplex, in the current edition of [Expiring
    Monthly](http://www.expiringmonthly.com/). This article chronicles the history
    of volatility indices and looks at how the CBOE has recently begun to aggressively
    expand the scope of volatility indices and turn these into product platforms for
    futures, options and exchanged-traded products.
