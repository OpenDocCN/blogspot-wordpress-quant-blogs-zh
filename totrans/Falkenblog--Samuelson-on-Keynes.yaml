    It's rather enlightening portrait from one of Keynes's main popularizers on the
    cusp of a career that never wavered in its Keynesian enthusiasm. I think it pretty
    clearly highlights that *The General Theory* was, as von Mises said, a 'tract
    for the times,' because it rationalized greater governmental involvement in the
    economy and is pretty inscrutable (Samuelson compares it to that great scientific
    treatise, Finnegan's Wake). It's a classic non-falsifiable book, because as Samuelson
    notes, it's obscure.

    single testable equation; the essence is a gestalt. Keynes didn't even understand
    it, according to Samuelson, so good luck convincing a true believer you know what
    the GT means and it is wrong--you just don't know what it means!  Further, it
    contains the old theory as a special case, so it's not incompatible with any of
    those assumptions, logically.

    revolution driven intellectually by the Rights of Man, a theory. While Wordsworth
    was initially a big supporter of the French revolution, like Orwell in Spain 150
    years later, he became appalled by the increasing violence and fanaticism, and
    the resulting military officer taking charge to restore order. Like Edmond Burke,
    Wordsworth saw that ideologies are lethal abbreviations of thought. While the
    Keynesian revolution wasn't that destructive, it was, to my mind, a similar abbreviation
    of thought towards an ideology, a larger state, justified via 'aggregate demand'
    in Keynes's General Theory.

    It is quite impossible for modern students to realize the full effect of what
    has been advisably called "The Keynesian Revolution" upon those of us brought
    up in the orthodox tradition. What beginners today often regard as trite and obvious
    was to us puzzling, novel, and heretical. To have been born as an economist before
    1936 was a boon—yes. But not to have been born too long before!

    virulence of a disease first attacking and decimating an isolated tribe of south
    sea islanders. Economists beyond 50 turned out to be quite immune to the ailment.
    With time, most economists in between began to run the fever, often without knowing
    or admitting their condition.

    like that of Keats on first looking into Chapman's Homer. No silent watcher, I,
    upon a peak in Darien. My rebellion against its pretensions would have been complete.
    Except for an uneasy realization that I did not at all understand what it was
    about. And I think I am giving away no secrets when I solemnly aver— upon the
    basis of vivid personal recollection—that no one else in Cambridge, Massachusetts,
    really knew what it was about for some twelve to eighteen months after its publication.
    Indeed. until the appearance of the mathematical models of Meade, Lange. Hicks,
    and Harrod, there is reason to believe that Keynes himself did not truly understand
    his own analysis.

    and appears to be in business to stay. Many economists who are most vehement in
    criticism of the specific Keynesian policies—which must always be carefully distinguished
    from the scientific analysis associated with his name—will never again be the
    same after passing through his hands. It has been wisely said that only in terms
    of a modern theory of effective demand can one understand and defend the so called
    "classical" theory of unemployment. It is perhaps not without additional significance.

    having once embraced the modern analysis, has—as far as I am aware—later returned

    displace the old latent belief in Say''s Law of Markets (according to which only
    "frictions" could give rise to unemployment and over-production). Events of the
    years following 1929 destroyed the previous economic synthesis. The economists''
    belief in the orthodox synthesis was not overthrown, but had simply atrophied:
    it was not as though one''s soul had faced a showdown as to the existence of the
    Deity and that faith was unthroned, or even that one had awakened in the morning
    to find that belief had flown away in the night: rather it was realized with a
    sense of belated recognition that one no longer had faith, that one had been living
    without faith for a long time, and that what, after all, was the difference? The
    nature of the world did not suddenly change on a black October day in 1929 so
    that a new theory became mandatory. Even in their day, the older theories were
    incomplete and inadequate: in 1815, in 1844, 1893, and 1920\. I venture to believe
    that the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries take on a new aspect when looked

    the book was cheated of his five shillings. It is not well suited for classroom
    use. It is arrogant, bad-tempered. polemical, and not overly generous in its acknowledgments.

    indistinctly, as if the author were hardly aware of its existence or cognizant
    of its properties; and certainly he is at his worst when expounding its relations
    to its predecessors. Flashes of insight and intuition intersperse tedious algebra.

    in times of a great war boom do such concepts as the marginal propensity to consume
    have validity. Perhaps, therefore, it would be more nearly correct to aver the
    reverse: that certain economists are Keynesian fellow-travelers only in boom times,
    falling off the band wagon in depression. If time permitted. it would be instructive
    to contrast the analysis of inflation during the Napoleonic and first World War
    periods with that of the recent War and correlate this with Keynes'' influence.
    Thus, the "inflationary gap" concept, recently so popular. seems to have been

    less important than Keynes himself believed…As for expectations, the General Theory
    is brilliant in calling attention to their importance and in suggesting many of
    the central features of uncertainty and speculation. It paves the way for a theory
    of expectations, but it hardly provides one. I myself believe the broad significance
    of the General Theory to be in the fact that it provides a relatively realistic,
    complete system for analyzing the level of effective demand and its fluctuations.
    More narrowly. I conceive the heart of its contribution to be in that subset of
    its equations which relate to the propensity to consume and to saving in relation
    to offsets-to-saving. In addition to linking saving explicitly to income, there
    is an equally important denial of the implicit "classical" axiom that motivated
    investment is indefinitely expansible or contractible, so that whatever people
    try to save will always be fully invested. It is not important whether we deny
    this by reason of expectations, interest rate rigidity, investment inelasticity
    with respect to overall price changes and the interest rate, capital or investment
    satiation, secular factors of a technological and political nature of what have
    you. But it is vital for business-cycle analysis that we do assume definite amounts
    of investment which are highly variable over time in response to a myriad of exogenous
    and endogenous factors, and which are not automatically equilibrated to full.

    that there is an invisible hand channeling the self-centered action of each individual
    to the social optimum. This is the sum and substance of his heresy. Again and
    again through his writings there is to be found the figure of speech that what
    is needed are certain "rules of the road" and governmental actions, which will
    benefit everybody, but which nobody by himself is motivated to establish or follow.
    Left to themselves during depression, people will try to save and only end up
    lowering society's level of capital formation and saving; during an inflation,
