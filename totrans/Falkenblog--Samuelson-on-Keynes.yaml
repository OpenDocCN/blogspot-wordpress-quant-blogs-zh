    It's rather enlightening portrait from one of Keynes's main popularizers on the
    cusp of a career that never wavered in its Keynesian enthusiasm. I think it pretty
    clearly highlights that *The General Theory* was, as von Mises said, a 'tract
    for the times,' because it rationalized greater governmental involvement in the
    economy and is pretty inscrutable (Samuelson compares it to that great scientific
    treatise, Finnegan's Wake). It's a classic non-falsifiable book, because as Samuelson
    notes, it's obscure.

    single testable equation; the essence is a gestalt. Keynes didn't even understand
    it, according to Samuelson, so good luck convincing a true believer you know what
    the GT means and it is wrong--you just don't know what it means!  Further, it
    contains the old theory as a special case, so it's not incompatible with any of
    those assumptions, logically.

    revolution driven intellectually by the Rights of Man, a theory. While Wordsworth
    was initially a big supporter of the French revolution, like Orwell in Spain 150
    years later, he became appalled by the increasing violence and fanaticism, and
    the resulting military officer taking charge to restore order. Like Edmond Burke,
    Wordsworth saw that ideologies are lethal abbreviations of thought. While the
    Keynesian revolution wasn't that destructive, it was, to my mind, a similar abbreviation
    of thought towards an ideology, a larger state, justified via 'aggregate demand'
    in Keynes's General Theory.
