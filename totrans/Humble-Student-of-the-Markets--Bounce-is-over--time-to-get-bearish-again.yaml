    oversold stock market rally based on what I observed in the term structure of
    VIX (see

    through Tuesday. I have been thinking about a second scenario where stock prices,
    instead of rallying when the VIX/VXV ratio exits an inverted condition (dotted
    vertical lines), consolidate and fall as they did in late January.

    in 2011\. When VIX/VXV ratio inverted in August and mean reverted, we saw a brief
    period of minor consolidation only to be followed by a waterfall decline into
    the final corrective low.

    after exiting VIX/VXV inversion. The difference seems to be the market`s behavior
    in the critical two or three days after exiting inversion. Did it see a sustainable
    rally, or consolidate sideways. If it`s the latter, the risk of further declines
    are very real.

    scenario as the base case. Since the Trend Model has already flashed a trading
    sell signal (see
