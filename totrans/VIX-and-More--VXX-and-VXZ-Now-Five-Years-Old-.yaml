    turmoil, I wanted to take a moment to acknowledge the fifth birthday of the two
    pioneering [VIX ETPs](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20ETN) :
    [VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX) and [VXZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXZ).
    Launched five weeks before stocks hit their 2008-09 financial crisis bottom, both
    VXX and VXZ have struggled against a tide of falling volatility over the course
    of the past five years and have also been battered by persistent [contango](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/contango)
    in the [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures),
    which has created additional head winds in the form of negative [roll yield](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/roll%20yield).'

- en: Note that even though each of the five years have been losing years for both
    products, there have been periods in which these products have been extremely
    strong performers. One of these periods was from July to October 2011 when VXX
    nearly tripled (maximum gain of 198%) and VXZ rallied some 66%. I mention this
    because both have performed well in January, with VXX up 13.0% as I type this
    and VXZ with gains of 2.2% for the year.

- en: While I am not going out on a limb and predicting a renaissance for these two
    VIX ETPs, they are two of the most important and liquid VIX ETPs on the market
    and can be attractive hedges or speculative trades when the markets go through
    a period of selling and/or there are concerns about a potential crisis.

    to offer my thoughts on them going forward.
