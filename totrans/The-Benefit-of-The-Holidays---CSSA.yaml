- en: 'It is certainly a hectic time of year. These days the projects and deadlines
    have been piling up and CSS -with a growing roster of international clients in
    different time zones – is now a 24/7 operation. As I write this in the wee hours
    of the morning, I confess to looking forward to my holidays-however brief. Surprisingly
    the best ideas I have ever had have always occured during the holidays. It is
    a time to relax your mind, and distract yourself with the truly important things
    in your life: friend and family. Somewhere following a few good nights sleep,
    and having re-charged by eating real food, the wheels in my head start turning
    again. Without the distractions of daily communications, or deadlines, the ideas
    flow freely like a river through my head where I begin to ponder each one by one.
    Whether these ideas are “micro” (strategy or indicator specific), or “macro” (theoretical,
    concepetual or business planning insights), I always manage to get excited over
    a few gems. The holidays is not just a time of pallid new year’s resolutions.
    It is a time to re-discover yourself, get in touch with those you care about,
    and best of all- a time to think of new ideas. And as you all know, I like to
    share these ideas as much as I can.'
