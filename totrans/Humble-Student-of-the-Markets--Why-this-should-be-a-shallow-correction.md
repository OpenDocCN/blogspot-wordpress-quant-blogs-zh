**Mid-week market update**: I had been expecting a choppy January for stock prices, and current market action has not disappointed. Investors came into 2024 all bulled up, but rising rates eventually spooked stock prices. It all came to a head with Fed Governor Waller's speech, in which he stated that the Fed is pivoting to an easing cycle, but the market expectations may have gotten ahead of themselves.

The S&P 500 has weakened into a support zone, while the 10-year Treasury yield is nearing a resistance zone. 

Here are some reasons why I believe that the market will experience a shallow correction.
