- en: Building upon the ML focus from [Trading the Unobservable](https://quantivity.wordpress.com/2010/02/15/trading-the-unobservable/),
    Triantafyllopoulos and Montana recently published a state space model for statarb
    spreads entitled [Dynamic Modeling of Mean-reverting Spreads for Statistical Arbitrage](http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/arxiv/pdf/0808/0808.1710v3.pdf).
    This article builds upon the 2005 Elliott *et al.* article Pairs Trading in [JQF](http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/rquf).

- en: Building on previous work, we embrace the state-space framework for modeling
    spread processes and extend this methodology along three different directions.
    First, we introduce timedependency in the model parameters, which allows for quick
    adaptation to changes in the data generating process. Second, we provide an on-line
    estimation algorithm that can be constantly run in real-time. Being computationally
    fast, the algorithm is particularly suitable for building aggressive trading strategies
    based on high-frequency data and may be used as a monitoring device for mean-reversion.
    Finally, our framework naturally provides informative uncertainty measures of
    all the estimated parameters.

    are familiar with [Statistical Arbitrage in the U.S. Equities Market](http://www.math.nyu.edu/faculty/avellane/AvellanedaLeeStatArb071108.pdf)
    by Avellaneda and Lee), this article provides interesting theoretical comparison.
