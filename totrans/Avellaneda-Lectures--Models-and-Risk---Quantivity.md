# Avellaneda Lectures: Models and Risk | Quantivity

Quantivity recently stumbled upon the following *two excellent lecture series* by [Marco Avellaneda](http://math.nyu.edu/faculty/avellane/) (affiliated with [Courant Institute](http://www.cims.nyu.edu//)), while researching a new trading strategy. The first series surveys quant strategies, with an emphasis on mean-reversion and factor models. The second surveys risk and portfolio management. All relevant for building quantitative trading strategies.

While this material is available elsewhere, self-contained lectures which coherently assemble important themes from the literature are a joy to read.
