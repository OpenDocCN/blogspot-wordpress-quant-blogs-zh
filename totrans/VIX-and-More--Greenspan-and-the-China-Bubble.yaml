    that the Chinese stock market is a bubble that has a limited life on the upside
    before things take an ugly turn.  I have no doubt that Greenspan is correct on
    this count, but then again the Chinese markets could continue to go parabolic
    up to and beyond the [Beijing Olympics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Summer_Olympics),
    which means at least another 9 ½ months.  Of course Greenspan has a mixed legacy
    in calling bubbles.  His famous “[irrational exuberance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_exuberance)”
    comment of December 5, 1996 came when the NASDAQ had just crossed 1300 and the
    bull market still had more than three years left to run.  If he’s risking his
    credibility here, does he have a stop loss plan?

    maintain double digit economic growth for another year while keeping investment
    speculation under control and avoiding a stock market panic.  If they believe
    they can accomplish this tall order, will they try to let off some steam now and
    have the economy coast into the Olympics or try to keep the freight train barreling
    down the track and tighten the screws on the economy only after the closing ceremonies
    are behind us?

    but as their influence continues to grow and a broader group of global investors
    seeks to participate in some of the gains, this is a story that I find myself
    spending more time following.  In this regard, I have found two web sites in particular
    that have been helpful in providing news and data about various Chinese stocks:  [China
    Analyst](http://www.cnanalyst.com/) is a site that has a wealth of tables, stock
    rankings and news (their recent coverage of BIDU’s earnings was extremely comprehensive);
    [Cougar Jump](http://cougarjump.wordpress.com/) is a highly informative data-oriented
    blog run by CH Tan.'

    chart of [FXI](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=fxi), the [iShares FTSE/Xinhua
    China 25 Index](http://www.ishares.com/fund_info/detail.jhtml?investorType=INDIV&symbol=FXI&qt=FXI&_requestid=41515)
    of stocks listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.  I’ll have more to say about
    this chart later.  As a matter of fact, there is a temptation to make this space
    into an “All China, all the time!” media outlet, but for now at least, I’ll keep
    <place st="on"><country-region st="on">China</country-region></place> as a sub-plot.
