    auctions](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Treasury%20Auctions) will
    be a relatively quiet sideshow or eventually take the center stage in the ongoing
    financial crisis. As the number of potential disaster scenarios continues to shrink,
    one subject that I see receive surprisingly little play in the blogosphere is
    one of the few remaining potential disasters: the auction of U.S. debt.'

- en: The concern is that as the U.S. debt grows, so does the volume of Treasury debt
    for each auction. The big fear is that at some point the supply of U.S. debt may
    begin to outstrip the demand. At the moment, China and Japan account for about
    2/3 of all foreign holdings of U.S. Treasuries; any plateau in the demand for
    U.S. debt from these two nations might necessitate higher interest rates to stimulate
    demand and could send potentially traumatic shock waves throughout the economy.
    This is the disaster scenario. So far, I am happy to report, demand for Treasuries
    has been robust and yields have remained at very low levels.

- en: The U.S. Treasury auctions a mixture of Treasury Bills (with maturities from
    4 weeks to 52 weeks), Treasury Notes (from 2 to 10 years) and 30-Year Treasury
    Bonds. The T-Bills are auctioned on what is largely a weekly cycle, with the typical
    pattern seeing the 13-week and 26-week T-Bills slotted for Mondays and the 4-week
    and 52-week T-Bills on Tuesdays. Given the frequency of these T-Bill auctions
    and the relatively low demand from foreign central banks, the T-Bill auctions
    are probably the least important auctions in terms of being able to gauge market
    sentiment and the strength of foreign demand.

- en: The more important auctions are of the Treasury Notes, where the [10-Year Note](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/10%20Year%20Treasury%20Note)
    has become the de-facto benchmark for U.S. long-term debt. Treasury Note auctions
    are best understood as occurring on a monthly cycle, with the 3-Year and 10-Year
    Notes typically auctioned on Tuesdays and Wednesdays during the second week of
    each month and the 2-Year, 5-Year and 7-Year Notes typically auctioned off on
    Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays of the last week of each month.

- en: In short, the yield determines the cost of the debt refunding and/or the price
    sensitivity of the bidders. The bid-to-cover ratio is simply the total dollar
    amount of the bids tendered by the total amount of the securities being auction
    and reflects demand relative to supply. Finally, the percentage of indirect bidders
    is used as a proxy for demand from foreign central banks, as indirect bids are
    bids of significant size that do not go through the primary dealer community.

- en: Going forward, investors should keep an eye on the Treasury auctions, particularly
    on the demand for U.S. Treasury Notes. Should yields start rising, bid-to-cover
    ratios start falling and participation by indirect bidders begin to decline, then
    we may have the beginnings of a new kind of debt crisis on our hands.
