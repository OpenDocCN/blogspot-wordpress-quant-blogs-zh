    on their abilities, which are highly driven by bourgeois values. Over the past
    50 years, the working class have lost their industriousness, honesty, religion,
    and respect for marriage, and he presents a bunch of data to bolster this argument
    (eg, less than 5% of college educated white women have children out of wedlock,
    but 40% of white women without college do). This book is a straightforward extension
    of the main arguments in his two prior best sellers, where in

    their squareness, but rather, by advocating their lifestyle and scorning those
    who fail to live up to it—we need more of what is usually called 'blaming the
    victim'. Murray singles out the modern welfare state as the key instigator for
    our moral squalor, but I rather think our lack of faith in bourgeois values in
    general was the first mover here. Surely enlarging the dole increases the size
    of its patronage pool, but I still think policy is more symptomatic than causal.

    sexual urges were viewed as having a powerful biological basis, while traits such
    as responsibility, dependability, orderliness, guilt, and the delay of gratification,
    are imposed by a repressive, pathology-inducing society, often a mere 'transference'
    from some guilt-trip inspired by traumatic potty-training or one's desire to have
    sex with one's mother. A bourgeois conscience became a hang-up that prevents you
    from realizing your authentic self (note the importance of 'self-actualization'

    norms such as those celebrated by Puritans, Quakers, and Calvinists. Such norms
    were rarely perfectly achieved but nonetheless seen as unambiguously good, and
    so aspirational. It's useful for anyone but especially children to have clear
    goals as to what is the 'good life', and an important point to remember in this
    arena is that we should not let the perfect be the enemy of the good, especially
    in comparison with the untried.

    sociology departments, psychologists have found that children will accept high
    levels of parental controls, but only if the relationship with the parents is
    positive. The key is having moral authority that comes from demonstrated competence
    and consistency. So too will the lower classes accept judgment from the upper
    classes if they think such observations come from those who believe what they
    say and say something true and important. Currently, they simply hear about how
    great it is to be a victim, how noble it is to be poor, powerless, or discriminated;
    to be wronged is the ultimate in righteousness. This simply isn't true and the
    poor know it. Suffering does have meaning when it cannot be controlled, and in
    such times a stoic attitude is truly heroic, often taken out of a higher duty
    to one's neighbors and family. But simply suffering low status because one does
    not have a job, stopped paying their mortgage, is in jail, or did not learn a
    trade, is usually the result of simple sloth and shortsightedness, and all their
    friends and family know it.
