    "Cluster Random Subspace- A Process Diagram") would work for portfolio optimization.
    But the concept can be extended to prediction and classification. Obviously “Random
    Forests” could incorporate this concept to build superior decision trees with
    fewer samples–but I would caution that decision trees tend to have poor performance
    for prediction of financial time series (this is due to binary thresholding and
    over-fitting). However, standard multiple regression has been a workhorse in finance
    simply because it is more robust and less prone to over-fitting than other machine-learning
    approaches. One of the challenges in regression is that it breaks down when you
    have a lot of variables to choose from and some of them are highly correlated.
    There are many established ways for dealing with this problem (PCA, stepwise regression
    etc), but CRSM remains an excellent candidate since it can be used to form a robust
    ensemble forecast from a large group of predictors. It does not address the initial
    choice of variables, but at least it can automatically handle a large group of
    candidates that may contain some highly correlated variables. CRSM Regression
    is a good way to proceed when you have a lot of possible indicators, but don’t
    have any pre-conceived ideas for constructing a good model. Here is a process
    diagram for one of many possible methods to apply CRSM Regression:'
