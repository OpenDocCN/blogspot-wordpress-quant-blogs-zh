    on the merits of Valeant (VRX) as an investment. Instead, it was an illustration

    their own business risk.

    inexpensively priced in relation to their prior year’s EBIT (earnings before interest
    and tax). The top chart plots the simulated performance of this simple approach
    to value investing in context of the SP500’s total return. The bottom chart shows
    how much and for how long the value strategy fell behind the SP500 at each point
    in time.

    the value approach achieved a compound annualized return of 17.2% while the SP500’s
    total return (price change plus dividends) did 10.3%. Sounds amazing!

    have had to endure 14-years (1988 through 2001) where he wouldn’t have received
    much feedback that he was on the right path. Soon after recovering from falling
    behind the market by 30% from 1988-1991, he would have lagged by nearly 50% across
    a grueling 6 years.

    you feel when investing actual money in the markets. The feelings you get from
    making or losing money can’t be simulated. The same is true of those who try to
    turn research into an investable strategy.

    this sounds overly scientific — time dilation. I’ll explain what I mean. This
    is not relativistic time dilation as the only time I move at speeds near light
    is when there is pizza involved. But to borrow the term, your sense of time does
    change when you are running real money. Suppose you look at a cumulative return
    of a strategy with a Sharpe ration of 0.7 and see a three year period with poor
    performance. It does not phase you one drop. You go: “Oh, look, that happened
    in 1973, but it came back by 1976, and that’s what a 0.7 Sharpe ratio does.” ***But
    living through those periods takes — subjectively, and in wear and tear on your
    internal organs — many times the actual time it really lasts. If you have a three
    year period where something doesn’t work, it ages you a decade. You face an immense
    pressure to change your models, you have bosses and clients who lose faith, and
    I cannot explain the amount of discipline you need.***'

    at an individual and institutional level, is forcing investment managers to take
    steps to control their own business risk and become sensitive to benchmark tracking
    error. If you want to know who to blame for closet indexing, look in the mirror.

    very short. Even for institutions, the typical grace period for poor performance
    is no more than 2-3 years. In that case, you need to be aware of business risk
    when sizing your bets in a portfolio.

    should AUM plummet, the way a manager controls business risk also affects the
    culture of the organization. For example, sales and marketing staff tend not to
    have the same level of conviction as the investment staff on the investment philosophy.
    Managed improperly, they can become "order takers" during good times, which is
    an easy job that practically anyone can do, but abandon the organization during
    bad times.
