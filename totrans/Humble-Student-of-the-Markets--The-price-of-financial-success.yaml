- en: We explore the impact of limited attention on investment performance by analyzing
    the returns of hedge fund managers who are distracted by personal events such
    as marriage and divorce. ***We find that marriages and divorces are associated
    with significantly lower fund alpha, during the six-month period surrounding the
    event and for up to two years after the event.*** Relative to the pre-event window,
    fund alpha falls by an annualized 8.50 percent during a marriage and 7.39 percent
    during a divorce. Busy fund managers who manage larger funds and engage in high
    tempo investment strategies are more affected by marriage. ***Fund managers who
    depend on interpersonal relationships in their investment strategies are more
    affected by divorce.*** We show that behavioral biases may partially explain the
    connection between inattention and performance deterioration. The difference between
    the proportion of gains realized and the proportion of losses realized widens
    during a marriage and a divorce, indicating that inattentive hedge fund managers
    are more prone to the disposition effect. Taken together, our findings suggest
    that limited investor attention can hurt the investment performance of professional
    money managers.
