- en: For the second week in a row, the VIX notched its lowest weekly close since
    [2/27](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/February%2027), ending the
    week at 12.07, down slightly from a close of 12.20 the previous week.

- en: The lack of movement in the VIX has dropped the bullish bias in the VIX Weekly
    Sentiment Indicator ([VWSI](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VWSI))
    from a +3 level last week to the current reading of +1.  At this stage of the
    game, it would take a sub-11 reading in the coming week for me to see a risk/reward
    profile favorable enough to consider opening a long position in the VIX.

    apply to the VIX, not to the broader markets, which are usually negatively correlated
    with the VIX.)

    of the wine warrants, so you probably won’t have many options at your local wine
    store.
