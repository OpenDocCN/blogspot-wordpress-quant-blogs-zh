Free NaturalLanguage Processor for .Net 2.0.

Worthwhile if you are going to construct a semantic analysis engine from scratch.

I have been reading up on NLP. Take the sentence "Time flies like an arrow.". How many different semantic meanings does this statement have? Now imagine getting a news feed of financial information. How would you parse the news into an ontology that equity traders can work with? And how would traders use this information?

Matt is exploring the CEP engines right now (Streambase, Coral8, etc). I would be interested to see if and how these CEP engines can handle news feed. What kind of info would they need?
