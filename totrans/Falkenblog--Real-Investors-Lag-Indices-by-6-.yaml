- en: So, this 6% investor underperformance you would think would be very interesting
    news, because the risk premium is one of the most important facts in all of economics,
    being the subject of thousands of research pieces, but instead it has had about
    zero impact. No one finds it interesting because it is not useful to academics
    or investment companies.

    twentieth century finance was when two professors at the University of Chicago,
    James H. Lorie and Lawrence Fisher, created what has become the preeminent database
    on stocks in the United States, what is now known as the Center for Research on
    Security Prices (CRSP) database.

  zh: 报道称纽约证券交易所上市的普通股的平均回报率为9%，从1926年1月30日到1960年。纽约时报的文章中还有一张他们在一个有大型计算机的房间的照片，强调这非常科学。有趣的是，如果你读了他们的论文，你会看到学者们通过指出这个最终结果并不显著来淹埋他们的灵感，强调了学者们喜欢强调他们的技术，而不是结果。

    but with dividends added, about the same, so why the big deal? It was important
    because while this old data probably still contains large amounts of survivorship
    bias, it meticulously corrected for all sorts of other issues and therefore added
    the patina of academic rigor to a fundamental financial constant: the equity risk
    premium.'

  zh: 现在，这比道琼斯指数的平均年回报率高出3%，但加上股息后，大致相同，那为何这么重要呢？这很重要，因为虽然这些旧数据可能仍然包含大量的存活者偏差，但它们细致地纠正了各种其他问题，因此给基本的金融常数“股权风险溢价”增添了学术严谨的光泽。
- en: This result stood for decades, and led to many to think the equity risk premium
    was on the order of 6-8% up to the internet bubble of 2001\. It validated the
    new 'risk premium' paradigm that was being created in the early 1960s, where risk,
    properly measured, generates an observable return premium over time, because without
    higher expected returns no one would invest in risky assets. When combined with
    a stock's beta, it generated the expected return for each asset, making a seemingly
    qualitative problem one amenable to linear programming.

  zh: 这一结果在数十年间都经受得住考验，并导致很多人认为股权风险溢价在2001年互联网泡沫之前约为6-8%。它证实了60年代初创建的新的“风险溢价”范式，即风险在适当衡量的情况下，会产生随时间可观的回报溢价，因为如果没有更高的预期回报，没有人会投资于风险资产。当与股票的贝塔结合在一起时，它会为每个资产产生预期回报，使看似是一个定性问题的问题变得适宜进行线性规划。
- en: Much has happened since then, most importantly, the poor returns since 2000,
    which have reduced most estimates of the equity risk premium to around 3.5%. This
    excludes transaction costs, and adverse timing, which are captured in the Dalbar
    data. And of course this excludes taxes.

  zh: 自那时以来发生了许多重要的事情，最重要的是自2000年以来的糟糕回报，这使得对股权风险溢价的大多数估计降至约3.5%。这不包括交易成本和不利时机，这些在Dalbar数据中有所体现。当然，这也不包括税收。
