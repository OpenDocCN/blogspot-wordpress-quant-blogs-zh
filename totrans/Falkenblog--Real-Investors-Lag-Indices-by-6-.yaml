    investors underperform indices, and it's being ignored. In the 2008 Journal of

    assumes reflect investor returns. He looked at data from 401(k) plans, and found
    that from 1988 through 2007, while the S&P 500 returned 11.81 percent annually
    and Treasury bills returned 4.53 percent, the average investor achieved a return
    of only 4.48 percent.

- en: So, this 6% investor underperformance you would think would be very interesting
    news, because the risk premium is one of the most important facts in all of economics,
    being the subject of thousands of research pieces, but instead it has had about
    zero impact. No one finds it interesting because it is not useful to academics
    or investment companies.

    twentieth century finance was when two professors at the University of Chicago,
    James H. Lorie and Lawrence Fisher, created what has become the preeminent database
    on stocks in the United States, what is now known as the Center for Research on
    Security Prices (CRSP) database.

    was 9 percent for the NYSE from January 30, 1926, to through 1960\. Included in
    the NYT article was a flattering picture of them in a room with a big computer,
    emphasizing that this was very scientific. Interestingly, if you read their paper,
    you will see how academics bury their lede by noting that this final result is
    not conspicuous, highlighting that academics like to emphasize their technique,
    not the results.

    but with dividends added, about the same, so why the big deal? It was important
    because while this old data probably still contains large amounts of survivorship
    bias, it meticulously corrected for all sorts of other issues and therefore added
    the patina of academic rigor to a fundamental financial constant: the equity risk
    premium.'

    was on the order of 6-8% up to the internet bubble of 2001\. It validated the
    new 'risk premium' paradigm that was being created in the early 1960s, where risk,
    properly measured, generates an observable return premium over time, because without
    higher expected returns no one would invest in risky assets. When combined with
    a stock's beta, it generated the expected return for each asset, making a seemingly
    qualitative problem one amenable to linear programming.

    which have reduced most estimates of the equity risk premium to around 3.5%. This
    excludes transaction costs, and adverse timing, which are captured in the Dalbar
    data. And of course this excludes taxes.
