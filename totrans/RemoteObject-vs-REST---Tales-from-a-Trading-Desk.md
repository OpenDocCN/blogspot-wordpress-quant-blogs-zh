# RemoteObject vs REST | Tales from a Trading Desk

## RemoteObject vs REST

Adobe and Microsoft appear to be at opposite ends of the spectrum with regards to RIA server data access. Adobe offers [RemoteObject](http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/15/asdocs_en/mx/servicetags/RemoteObject.html) as part of [LiveCycle ES](http://www.adobe.com/products/livecycle/dataservices/indepth.html) – RPC service for [Flex](http://www.themidnightcoders.com/blog/2007/03/flex-remoteobject-vs-webservice.html) clients. Microsoft on the other hand appears to be going down the REST road – e.g. [ADO.NET Data Services](http://blogs.msdn.com/astoriateam/default.aspx) (code name [“Astoria”](http://astoria.mslivelabs.com/)). Will Adobe gain an advantage by sticking with RemoteObject?

Offtopic: Apple says [no](http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/djf500/200803041742DOWJONESDJONLINE000829_FORTUNE5.htm) to Adobe (iPhone)
