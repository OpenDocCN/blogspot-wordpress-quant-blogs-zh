# VIX and More: Headwinds Index: Financials (XLF) vs. Oil (USO)

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/07/headwinds-index-financials-xlf-vs-oil.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/07/headwinds-index-financials-xlf-vs-oil.html#0001-01-01)

Two numbers have been moving consistently in the wrong direction for the US economy during the past few months: oil prices and bank loan portfolio quality.

The chart below, which reflects a ratio of the valuation of financials (

) to crude oil prices (per the

ETF), neatly captures the recent double threat posed by trends in these two sectors.

You can make an excellent argument that a bottom will not be in until at least one of the two trends, probably both, have reversed. My thinking is that the XLF:USO ratio chart is an excellent tool to monitor those two trends and pinpoint the turnaround. At the very least, I consider the XLF:USO ratio to be a reasonable proxy for two of the major headwinds that the markets are grappling with.
