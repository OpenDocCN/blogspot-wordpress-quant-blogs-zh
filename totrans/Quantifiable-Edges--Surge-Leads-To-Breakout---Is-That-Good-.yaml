- en: More bailout talk today led to another surge of buying. The major averages closed
    strongly positive on good breadth and increased volume. Technically notable is
    the fact that the triangle pattern in the S&P was broken to the upside. An argument
    could be made that the triangle broke to the downside on Friday and that break
    quickly led to an upside reversal. Based on the definitions in the studies I laid
    out last week, there was no break on Friday. The first breakout came today. In
    this case I’ll stick with my definitions because those are the ones that were
    used to develop the statistics. The minimum target based on those studies' triangle
    measurements would be 1446.57\. Of note is that over 70% of these patterns have
    failed to reach their target before dropping below the lower triangle line. In
    this case a failure would mean a move below 1327.04\. It appears looking for an
    entry to fade this breakout may provide the greatest edge.

  zh: 今天有更多的救助谈话导致了一次购买的冲动。主要平均指数以良好的宽度和增加的成交量强劲上涨。技术上值得注意的是，标普的三角形模式被向上突破。可以说三角形在周五向下突破，并且突破迅速导致了向上的反转。根据我上周提到的研究中的定义，周五并没有突破。今天的第一次突破来了。在这种情况下，我将坚持我的定义，因为那些是用来开发统计数据的定义。基于这些研究的三角形测量，最小目标将是1446.57点。值得注意的是，超过70%的这些模式在跌破下三角形线之前未能达到其目标。在这种情况下，失败意味着低于1327.04点的移动。看起来寻找一个做空突破的入场可能提供最大的优势。
- en: The surge the last two days which broke this market out has certainly been impressive.
    I looked back to see how the market had reacted following similar boughts of strong
    buying. Below is a table displaying how the market has performed near-term following
    two strong days of buying during a long-term downtrend.

  zh: 过去两天推动市场突破的冲动无疑是令人印象深刻的。我回顾了市场在长期下跌趋势中跟随强烈买入之后的反应。以下是市场在长期下跌趋势中跟随两个强烈买入日期的短期表现表格。

- en: Historically, fading these surges has provided a decent edge. As can be seen
    in the picture above, not all breakouts are good news. Between the 2-day surge
    and the triangle breakout study it appears the edge over the next few days is
    to the downside.

  zh: 历史上，对这些冲动的消退提供了一个不错的优势。如图所示，并非所有的突破都是好消息。在2天的冲动和三角形突破研究之间，看来在接下来的几天里，优势是向下的。
