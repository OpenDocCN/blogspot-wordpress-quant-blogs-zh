- en: More bailout talk today led to another surge of buying. The major averages closed
    strongly positive on good breadth and increased volume. Technically notable is
    the fact that the triangle pattern in the S&P was broken to the upside. An argument
    could be made that the triangle broke to the downside on Friday and that break
    quickly led to an upside reversal. Based on the definitions in the studies I laid
    out last week, there was no break on Friday. The first breakout came today. In
    this case I’ll stick with my definitions because those are the ones that were
    used to develop the statistics. The minimum target based on those studies' triangle
    measurements would be 1446.57\. Of note is that over 70% of these patterns have
    failed to reach their target before dropping below the lower triangle line. In
    this case a failure would mean a move below 1327.04\. It appears looking for an
    entry to fade this breakout may provide the greatest edge.

    I looked back to see how the market had reacted following similar boughts of strong
    buying. Below is a table displaying how the market has performed near-term following
    two strong days of buying during a long-term downtrend.

- en: Historically, fading these surges has provided a decent edge. As can be seen
    in the picture above, not all breakouts are good news. Between the 2-day surge
    and the triangle breakout study it appears the edge over the next few days is
    to the downside.
