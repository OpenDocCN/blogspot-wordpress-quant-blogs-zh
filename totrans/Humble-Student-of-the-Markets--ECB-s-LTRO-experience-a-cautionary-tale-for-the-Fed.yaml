- en: Recall how the focus on MBS came about. QE2 involved $600 billion in the purchase
    of Treasuries, which pushed down the Treasury yield curve, flooded the system
    with liquidity and prompted investors to take more risk. The net effect of QE2
    was to push up stock and commodity prices, but didn't do very much for the real
    economy. In effect, it found that it was pushing on a string. In response, the
    Fed wanted to concentrated on risk premiums where it mattered, such as mortgage
    rates, in order to stimulate the housing market. Thus the impetus for QE3 was
    born. Target MBS, it was said, and you will push down the cost of home ownership
    and stimulate housing.

    now on only be influenced by large quality collateral holdings — which the central
    banks increasingly lacked. The public funding market, dictated by central banks,
    became the domain of trash collateral — which no one really cared about.
