- en: NYSE volume came in at the lowest level in over 2 weeks as the market rallied
    on Monday. Conventional wisdom suggests this low volume is a bad sign and it hurts
    the chances for a further bounce/rally. I’ve seen many comments in the last 24
    hours stating the bounce cannot be trusted because of the low volume. So below
    is one test I ran examining this theory.

    doesn’t seem the low volume is any kind of a warning sign. In fact it appears
    this setup provides a bullish edge. Perhaps very weak volume leaves just enough
    doubters that they end up chasing the market higher over the next several days
    as they become more convinced.
