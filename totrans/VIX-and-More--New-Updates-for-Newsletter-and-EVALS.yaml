- en: This is a quick update to let readers know that I have recently posted detailed
    updates for the *[VIX and More Subscriber Newsletter](http://vixandmoresubscriber.blogspot.com/)*
    as well as for *[VIX and More – EVALS](http://vixandmoreevals.blogspot.com/)*,
    which is essentially a model portfolio based on [VIX exchange-traded products](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20ETN)
    that complements the newsletter.

    weekly and provides general market commentary, an asset class outlook and an explanation
    of my current investment thesis, as well as a more detailed analysis of market
    sentiment, volatility, the [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures)
    [term structure](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/term%20structure),
    and trading opportunities in the volatility space. Over the course of the past
    year or two, there has been an increased emphasis on various ways to trade the
    VIX ETPs, including the use of several proprietary indices to evaluate the timeliness
    of selected trading approaches. One feature that has been popular since the launch
    of the newsletter is the Stock of the Week. In the [Q3 Newsletter Update](http://vixandmoresubscriber.blogspot.com/2012/10/q3-2012-newsletter-update-with-stock-of.html)
    I discussed the Stock of the Week selection process in some detail; in the recently
    completed [Q4 Newsletter Update](http://vixandmoresubscriber.blogspot.com/2013/01/q4-2012-newsletter-update-with-stock-of.html),
    I elaborate on the performance of the Stock of the Week in 2012 (up more than
    100%) and also talk about four proprietary indices I use to evaluate the timeliness
    of selected VIX ETP trading strategies.

    that trades the [VIX ETPs](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2013/01/vix-etp-performance-in-2012.htmlhttp:/vixandmore.blogspot.com/2012/11/performance-of-vix-etps-during-current.htmlhttp:/vixandmore.blogspot.com/2012/09/updates-to-vix-etp-landscape-add-vixh.html)
    and a handful of other ETPs with a volatility component. The [EVALS Q4 Update](http://vixandmoreevals.blogspot.com/2013/01/evals-q4-2012-update-up-6197-for-2012.html)
    details performance data, risk-adjusted performance data, trading data, etc. for
    a model portfolio that posted a gain of 62% in 2012\. Additional information can
    be gleaned from the [EVALS One-Year Summary and Performance Update](http://vixandmoreevals.blogspot.com/2012/12/evals-one-year-summary-and-performance_4200.html),
    as well as previous posts, such as [EVALS Relaunches, Now Focusing on VIX Exchange-Traded
    Products](http://vixandmoreevals.blogspot.com/2011/12/evals-relaunches-now-focusing-on-vix.html).'
