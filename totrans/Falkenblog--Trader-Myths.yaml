    He converts a mess of analysis and intuition into simple bets. He makes moves.
    If his predictions are better than everyone else's, he wins money; if not, he
    loses it.

    are the best-of-the-best, constantly working on how they can best advance social
    welfare by seeing win-win exchanges mere mortals cannot. If you are a trader,
    you might want to send it to your mom or girlfriend.

    bookies who make money off the vig, and have little insight about 'true value'
    but usually a lot of franchise value in their brand or network of contacts, which
    is why they aren't as smart as they would be if they were simply price-taking
    market wizards. Indeed, most of the first

    money without risk. When they have to inventory it, they need it hedged and they
    have to hope it was priced well, which shows up statistically in the inventory
    depreciation. Hedging is not insanely complicated for the risk factors you can
    hedge, and for those you can't you have understood limits (the

    derivatives, price them, and add some profit to anticipate adverse selection and
    cover your fixed costs plus any transaction costs (eg, the cost of implementing
    necessary hedges). Consider the following equity derivative transaction described
    in the article:'

    An 11% yield necessarily has about an 18% default rate in a risk neutral world
    assuming a 50% loss-in-event-of-default, higher if you believe in a risk premium.

    value discounted by libor, applying probabilities from market prices for options
    and underlyings. This will be the lower bound to any price quoted to the buyer;
    they can't create 12% yields without massive downside any more than a pool of
    subprime loans can create a AAA security without massive subordinate tranches.
