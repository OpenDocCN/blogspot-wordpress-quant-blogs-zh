    be calculating the risks of holding those positions over the weekend and imagining
    what sort of headlines might greet you and your portfolio on Monday morning.

- en: There is so much headline risk – or at least perceived headline risk – out there
    right now that I suspect it will be very difficult for the bulls to put together
    a sustained rally today.  That being said, each Friday going forward is going
    to be a litmus test of sorts for the bulls, particularly next Friday, which falls
    just before a three day weekend in the US.

    to begin talking about statistical significance and confidence intervals, the
    first five Fridays of the year have a mean loss of 1.30%, while Mondays through
    Thursdays have only seen an average drop of 0.37% over the first 21 non-Friday
    sessions of the year.

- en: In simplistic terms, I do not think that the bulls can make a credible case
    for a market turnaround as long as they are unwilling to bid prices up in advance
    of the weekend.  When Fridays start looking up and weekend risks start looking
    palatable, this may be one of the signs that we have put in a bottom.
