I will away the week of October 7th. I will be travelling to Paris and then to Nancy (France) for the annual Nancy Jazz Pulsations festival. The purpose of my trip is to see a 2-night concert by my favorite band,

[Magma](http://www.seventhrecords.com/)

. The famous French bassist, Jannick Top, will be performing with Magma, and for me, this recreation of their famous 1974 line-up is reason enough for me to dip into my AMEX points....
