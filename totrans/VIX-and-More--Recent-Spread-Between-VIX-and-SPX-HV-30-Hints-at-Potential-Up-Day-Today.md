# VIX and More: Recent Spread Between VIX and SPX HV 30 Hints at Potential Up Day Today

Yesterday the VIX closed above the 30 day [historical volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/historical%20volatility) of the SPX for only the sixth time since October 10^(th). Of interest to some, the SPX has performed extremely well in subsequent trading days on four of those five previous days, logging gains of 11.6%, 10.8%, 4.78%, and 4.3%. The sole loss was a day in which the SPX fell 3.2%. Extending this analysis farther back in time reveals a less impressive, but still positive recent pattern.
