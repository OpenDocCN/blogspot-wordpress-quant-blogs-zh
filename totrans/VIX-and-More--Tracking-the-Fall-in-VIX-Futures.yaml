- en: The last four days have seen a dramatic decline in all things related to the
    VIX. The cash/spot VIX is down 26% from last Wednesday’s close as I write this
    and the [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures)
    have followed the VIX down to varying degrees. The graphic below shows the changes
    in all the VIX contracts during the last four days – a period during which the
    entire VIX futures [term structure](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/term%20structure)
    has fallen sharply.

- en: As is usually the case, the decline in the front month (June) contract is the
    sharpest of the group and has actually exceeded the decline in the cash/spot VIX
    during the same period. With the June contract set to expire at the open of trading
    tomorrow, it is not surprising that the contract have been as volatile as the
    VIX index in the last few days. Note that at the other end of the term structure,
    the back month (February 2013) VIX futures contracts have fallen only 6.8%, about
    ¼ of the decline seen in the front month futures. Given where we are in the current
    expiration cycle (right at the very end), the changes in the other months relative
    to the front month VIX futures are in line with historical norms.

- en: The bottom line is that even with the VIX hovering around the 18.00 line, investors
    are still anticipating a VIX in the 29-30 range for the beginning of 2013\. While
    this may sound high to some, it is down from expectations of a VIX of 31-32 just
    last week.

    just in watching the gyrations of the financial markets for the next few quarters.
    One other thing I am nearly certain of: when the VIX futures make big moves, new
    opportunities are bound to arise.'
