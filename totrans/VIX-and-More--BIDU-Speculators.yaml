    (“People Trading ___ Also Traded ___”) function back in September, I certainly
    did not expect that it would become a recurring feature on the blog.

    as my example stock and came up with a good list of speculative companies – all
    of which were taken to the woodshed at the end of October and sold aggressively
    over the past six months or so.

    behold, BIDU is up over 70% in the past month.  So, I asked that same rhetorical
    question once again and optionsXpress was kind enough to oblige me with a list
    of companies that BIDU speculators have been pushing up over the past month.  [*All
    optionsXpress customers can do the same for any security by going to the Quotes
    tab, clicking on Quote Detail, then clicking on the People Trading… link under
    the chart on the right*.]

    of two financial plays, [MER](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/MER)
    and [XLF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLF), though it is interesting
    to see how the list has changed since [the last time I did this](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/10/update-on-people-trading-bidu-also.html),
    which just happened to be on October 30, 2007, at the time the markets were peaking.
