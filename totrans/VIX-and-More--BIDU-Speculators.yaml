    (“People Trading ___ Also Traded ___”) function back in September, I certainly
    did not expect that it would become a recurring feature on the blog.

  zh: 当我第一次查看optionsXpress的[交易模式](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Trading%20Patterns)（“交易___的人还交易___”）功能时，我当然没有想到它会成为博客上的一个反复出现的特征。
- en: I did, however, have the good fortune of selecting Baidu ([BIDU](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/BIDU))
    as my example stock and came up with a good list of speculative companies – all
    of which were taken to the woodshed at the end of October and sold aggressively
    over the past six months or so.

  zh: 然而，我确实有幸选择了百度（BIDU）作为我的示例股票，并列出了一个很好的投机公司名单——所有这些公司在十月底都遭到了猛烈抛售，在过去六个月左右的时间里被积极出售。
- en: Here we are in April and the market has put in a provisional bottom and lo and
    behold, BIDU is up over 70% in the past month.  So, I asked that same rhetorical
    question once again and optionsXpress was kind enough to oblige me with a list
    of companies that BIDU speculators have been pushing up over the past month.  [*All
    optionsXpress customers can do the same for any security by going to the Quotes
    tab, clicking on Quote Detail, then clicking on the People Trading… link under
    the chart on the right*.]

  zh: 现在我们来到了四月份，市场已经触底，而BIDU在过去一个月里上涨了超过70%。所以，我又问了那个同样设问的问题，optionsXpress很友好地给了我一份BIDU投机者过去一个月推动上涨的公司名单。[*所有optionsXpress客户都可以为任何证券做到这一点，只需前往报价标签，点击报价详情，然后点击右边的图表下方的People
    Trading…链接*]。

    of two financial plays, [MER](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/MER)
    and [XLF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLF), though it is interesting
    to see how the list has changed since [the last time I did this](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/10/update-on-people-trading-bidu-also.html),
    which just happened to be on October 30, 2007, at the time the markets were peaking.
