    point for both equity market leadership and bond prices. As a reminder, I use
    the Relative Rotation Graphs, or RRG charts, as the primary tool for the analysis
    of sector and style leadership. As an explanation, RRG charts are a way of depicting
    the changes in leadership in different groups, such as sectors, countries or regions,
    or market factors. The charts are organized into four quadrants. The typical group
    rotation pattern occurs in a clockwise fashion. Leading groups (top right) deteriorate
    to weakening groups (bottom right), which then rotates to lagging groups (bottom
    left), which change to improving groups (top left), and finally completes the
    cycle by improving to leading groups (top right) again.
