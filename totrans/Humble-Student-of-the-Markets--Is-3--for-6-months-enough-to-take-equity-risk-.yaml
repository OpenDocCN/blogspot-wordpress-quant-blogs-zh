    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. Past trading of

    Sam Eisenstadt. Eisenstadt has had a remarkable record of forecasting equity returns,
    according to Hulbert.

- en: The reason to take this projection seriously is Eisenstadt’s track record. Consider
    a statistic known as the r-squared, which measures the degree to which one data
    series predicts or explains another. If the first series perfectly predicted the
    second, the r-squared would be 1.0; if the first series had absolutely no predictive
    ability the r-squared would be zero.

    at the 95% confidence level that statisticians often use when determining if a
    pattern is genuine. Though you might be disappointed that this r-squared isn’t
    higher, you should know that most of the models that get attention on Wall Street
    and in the financial press have r-squareds that are far lower—if they’re not actually
    zero.

    a gain of about 3%. The chart shows Eisenstadt`s forecasts, as documented by Hulbert,
    since 2013\. The forecast levels are shown in blue, with the actual below (black
    if the market beat his target, red if it missed).

- en: Eisenstadt constructs his model to include all factors he has found to have
    an ability to project the stock market’s subsequent six-month return. Though his
    model is proprietary, Eisenstadt has told me that two of the more important inputs
    are low interest-rates and market momentum. Both factors are mildly positive right
    now.

    When I peek under the hood of the Eisenstadt's model, interest rates and momentum
    represent sources of both risk and opportunity to the market. Investors will have
    to judge for themselves whether a potential 6-month gain of 3% is worth the risk.
