- en: In part 2 we will take a look at ways to improve this baseline strategy using
    fundamental data. One important note about the simple 5-day strategy presented
    is that while it does well even over longer periods (the long only does over 30%,
    and the hedged portfolio does close to 40%) it is too erratic  to be used in its
    simple form for most traders. The drawdowns are not tolerable for my liking–nor
    are they likely to be acceptable to most traders. Nonetheless, it is a good way
    to think about adding to or improving existing strategies. There are several ways
    to do this from using longer-term RROC combined with short term and combining
    different RROC measures with indicators. This is just the tip of the iceberg as
    they say, and a more complex Level 3 or 4 analysis reveals some unique ways to
    transform this data into useable applications that truly blow away standard methods
    using only technical indicators. When my new site DV Indicators  is up and running,
    some proprietary research will be presented to subscribers as well as trading
    systems rotating across individual stocks in the S&P500, and the sector spyders.
