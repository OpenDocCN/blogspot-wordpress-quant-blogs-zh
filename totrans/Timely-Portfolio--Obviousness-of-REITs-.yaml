    assets been without the benefit of hindsight.  I already briefly touched on this
    flaw in [Bonds Much Sharpe -r Than Buffett](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2012/08/bonds-much-sharpe-r-than-buffett.html). 
    Of course, using what we now know is one of the best asset classes in the history
    of the world that has also experienced an anomalous and extremely negative correlation
    with equities during their distress will provide a very positive result.  Unfortunately,
    I have yet to find any research from the late 1970s or early 1980s that predicted
    such a glorious environment for bonds.

    over the last 12 years in any way would almost guarantee a pleasant result.  However,
    REITs were not so stellar for the 15 year period 1984-1999.  Would REITs have
    been such an obvious choice in 1999?  Of course, if we know the future, but I’m
    not so sure when we only knew the past.

    have been in the early 1980s when they did not even exist? Can we expect the next
    10 years to look like the last 10 years?
