    on the milieu and personalities involved in the debate. But basically, he says
    this guy (eg, Fama) thinks markets should be called efficient, and this other
    guy (eg, Dick Thaler) thinks markets should be called 'inefficient'. But Fox does
    not draw any such conclusion himself, or give one data to suggest one side is

    of prices in thousands of markets, some are too low or too high, but it is not
    obvious which because most are priced 'just right' given the information available.
    If you think it is easy, as implied by an irrational market, you don't check your

    a lot of smart analysis to figure out which.

    Such a book has its place on the bookshelf, but it is not part of the intellectual
    debate, more like learning about Hitler's childhood, which is interesting but
    really doesn't explain the concentration camps or Operation Barbarossa. Secondly,

    general on CNBC, to spout markets are inefficient takes a lot of chutzpah, because
    he sure had the motive, means, and opportunity, to set the market straight in
    the past two bubbles, but merely cheered them on, then after the collapse says

- en: Krugman thinks that a major intellectual debate is as simple as one side having
    bad intelligence or bad faith. This is a stupid way to view such disagreements,
    one Krugman makes repeatedly in his prominent screeds. As Oscar Wilde states 'Education
    is an admirable thing, but is well to remember from time to time that nothing
    that is worth knowing can be taught.' I understand the paradox of not being able
    to teach creativity, but one would think educated people could learn temperament
    and humility are part of wisdom,. Unfortunately, esteemed intellectuals lack these
    virtues in spades, making them disproportionately moronic.

  zh: 克鲁格曼认为重大的智力辩论就是一方有糟糕的情报或者恶意。这是一种愚蠢的看待这种分歧的方式，在他的显著宣传中，克鲁格曼一再表达这一点。正如奥斯卡·王尔德所说：“教育是一件令人钦佩的事情，但有必要不时地记住：任何值得知道的东西都不能被教导。”我理解教不了创造力的悖论，但人们会认为受过教育的人会学会气质和谦逊是智慧的一部分。不幸的是，受人尊敬的知识分子缺乏这些品德，使他们特别愚蠢。
