    on the milieu and personalities involved in the debate. But basically, he says
    this guy (eg, Fama) thinks markets should be called efficient, and this other
    guy (eg, Dick Thaler) thinks markets should be called 'inefficient'. But Fox does
    not draw any such conclusion himself, or give one data to suggest one side is
    generally right. People disagree, pointing to various evidence as definitive,
    evidence the other side thinks is more anecdotal or irrelevant. Ships passing

    the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management, whose partners included Scholes and
    Robert Merton, with whom Scholes shared another finance Nobel. L.T.C.M. eventually
    imploded, nearly taking the world economy down with it. But efficient-markets
    theory retained its hold on financial thought.

    he would know that Merton and Scholes where marketing props. The strategies LTCM
    employed were neither derived by, or managed by Scholes and Merton. The LTCM strategy
    had nothing to do with a tweak to the Black-Scholes option formula.

    AOL circa 1999, housing in 2006, or RCA in 1929\. Boring! It is much smarter to
    approach markets as if markets are rational. As there are literally thousands
    of prices in thousands of markets, some are too low or too high, but it is not
    obvious which because most are priced 'just right' given the information available.
    If you think it is easy, as implied by an irrational market, you don't check your
    assumptions enough. Several, perhaps hundreds, prices are wrong, but it takes
    a lot of smart analysis to figure out which.

    portrait of efficient markets. Good point. 'Don't judge a book by its cover',
    is actually a good cliche. You don't learn in there that markets are 'irrational',
    or that those creating that theory were biased, lazy, bought, or otherwise infringed.
    But clearly Krugman just takes the title and says here's another brick in my case
    why we need more government.

    that edifice [efficient markets] was built — and why so few were willing to acknowledge

    is a house of sand, metaphorically or otherwise. The theory has esteemed detractors,

    book, adding narrative, but no constructive argument to either side in the debate.
    Such a book has its place on the bookshelf, but it is not part of the intellectual
    debate, more like learning about Hitler's childhood, which is interesting but
    really doesn't explain the concentration camps or Operation Barbarossa. Secondly,
    Fox's book title and its jacket, leads to this kind of interpretation, and when

    dishonest, because it merely plays into the inconsistent opinion that markets
    are stupid by those same professionals that said absolutely nothing about weakening
    mortgage standards prior to 2007 (to take one example). For Mark Haynes, bloviator
    general on CNBC, to spout markets are inefficient takes a lot of chutzpah, because
    he sure had the motive, means, and opportunity, to set the market straight in
    the past two bubbles, but merely cheered them on, then after the collapse says
    'It was so obvious!' It's pathetic.

- en: Krugman thinks that a major intellectual debate is as simple as one side having
    bad intelligence or bad faith. This is a stupid way to view such disagreements,
    one Krugman makes repeatedly in his prominent screeds. As Oscar Wilde states 'Education
    is an admirable thing, but is well to remember from time to time that nothing
    that is worth knowing can be taught.' I understand the paradox of not being able
    to teach creativity, but one would think educated people could learn temperament
    and humility are part of wisdom,. Unfortunately, esteemed intellectuals lack these
    virtues in spades, making them disproportionately moronic.
