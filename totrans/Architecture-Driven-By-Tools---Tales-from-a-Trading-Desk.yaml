- en: Just a classic [video](http://vimeo.com/43612849) to watch.  Robert Martin provide
    some clear direction on what an architecture  should provide, and how people think
    “tools” are architecture.  I am still appalled at the number of supposed “software
    engineers” who can’t provide an architecture for the solution they are working
    on.  Tools 😦  Madness.  I suggest that anyone who works with me watch this video,
    and continue watching it 🙂
