- en: When talking about the financial sector and how they have been able to take
    advantage of QE to re-capitalise their damaged balance sheets, it ought to be
    said that QE has effectively allowed banks to ignore their underlying problems.
    QE has become a life support machine for the financial sector at virtually no
    cost to them but at a significant cost to the rest of society. That cannot go
    on ad infinitum. At some point in the not so distant future it will be financial
    reckoning day for the sector which bodes particularly badly for the European banks,
    most of which are way behind their U.K. and U.S. peers in terms of cleaning up
    their balance sheets.

    in their most recent Financial Stability Report. ***More than 50% of Spanish companies
    with loans in Spanish banks have an interest coverage ratio of less than one.
    In other words, the EBITDA of over half of all Spanish corporates does not even
    cover their interest expense*** (you would expect a healthy corporate borrower
    to have an interest coverage ratio of 3-5 times depending on the nature of the
    business). What's worse, the situation in Italy and Portugal is only marginally
    better. All of these problems have been largely ignored since the ECB stepped
    in with their brand of QE about two years ago and saved the European banking sector
    from a complete meltdown, but few, if any, of the underlying issues have yet been
    addressed.

    programs and the precariousness of the system even after all this central bank
    intervention. No doubt, a high degree of apparent systemic risk exists.

    light of the ECB's free put. The chart below of the relative returns of Financials
    show that their relative performance bottomed out in late 2011 and the sector
    has been in a relative uptrend since the summer of 2012.

    First, high beta small caps remain in a relative uptrend against large caps. Second,
    small caps are still outperforming despite the recent sell-off.

- en: The combination of a free ECB put and positive small cap outperformance in the
    face of weakness are suggestive of further gains in European stocks. Any weakness
    is likely to be a temporary pullback and should be viewed a buying opportunity.
    I would be inclined to focus on sectors and groups showing a high degree of leverage
    to a recovery, such as European financials and small cap stocks.
