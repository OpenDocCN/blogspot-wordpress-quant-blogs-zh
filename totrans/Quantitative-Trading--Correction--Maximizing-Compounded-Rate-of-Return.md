# Quantitative Trading: Correction: Maximizing Compounded Rate of Return

A few readers pointed out a typo and an arithmetic error in my article "

[Maximizing Compounded Rate of Return](http://epchan.blogspot.com/2006/10/maximizing-compounded-rate-of-return.html)

". In the geometric random walk example where the stock can go up or down 1% at every step, the mean rate of return

m

is 0%, (not 1%), and the compounded rate of return is -0.005% (not -0.5%). My sincere thanks to all my readers who mercilessly scrutinize my ideas and check my numbers!
