## Mixed mode HTTP / HTTPS

If you don’t have time to read troyhunt’s full [article](http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/04/the-beginners-guide-to-breaking-website.html?report) on “The beginners guide to breaking website security with nothing more than a Pineapple”, then at least try and read the conclusion sections, and follow the [link](http://www.troyhunt.com/2011/01/ssl-is-not-about-encryption.html) to “why it’s not ok to load login forms over HTTP even if they post to HTTPS”.

Finally, have a [read](http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/04/5-ways-to-implement-https-in.html) of “5 ways to implement HTTPS in an insufficient manner (and leak sensitive data)”
