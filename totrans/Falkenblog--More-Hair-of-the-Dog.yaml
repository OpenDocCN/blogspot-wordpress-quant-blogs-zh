- en: When you have a hangover, one cure is to drink more, though this is clearly
    a short-term solution. Since the housing market began to falter in 2007, Washington
    has tried to help via foreclosure mitigation, increased guarantees from the FHA,
    higher guarantee thresholds from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Fed purchase of mortgage
    assets, and the $8,000 home buyer's tax credit. Yet housing, and the economy,
    remain in a slump. The people in unsustainable consumption and production, and
    everything around them, are not investing because they know there's no future
    for them.

- en: the first point of attack is on a proposal that would require sellers of mortgage-backed
    securities to retain part of the risk should a package of loans go sour. The sellers
    would have to keep on their books at least 5 percent of the value of any baskets
    of loans they purchase from lenders and then resell to investors. One of the few
    exceptions to the requirement would be for mortgages on which the home buyer has
    made a down payment equal to 20 percent of the purchase price.

  zh: 第一个攻击点是一项提议，即要求出售抵押贷款支持证券的卖方在一套贷款出现风险时保留部分风险。出售方必须在他们的账簿上保留任何从贷款人那里购买并再销售给投资者的贷款篮子价值的至少5%。该要求的少数例外之一将是房屋买家支付等于购房价格20%的首付款的抵押贷款。

    director in La Raza’s office of research, advocacy and legislation. “These rules
    will so significantly deter the ability of first-time buyers to break into the
    market that we will see a real decline in home ownership.”

- en: 'Someone who can''t come up with 20 percent should not a home, they should rent.
    Homes require big cashflow investments for random problems such as broken water
    heaters, air conditioners, flooding. If you don''t have $10k lying around, your
    house is uninhabitable after such contingencies. Then there''s standard maintenance.
    As the Zimbabwean squatters found out with farming, you need to invest and cultivate
    a farm for it to be productive, it doesn''t just produce. So too with housing,
    as homes need constant investment just to keep them from falling apart: landscaping,
    fixing wiring in the house, new carpets, etc.'

  zh: 有人如果无法提供20%的首付款应该租房，而不是购房。购房需要大量的现金投入来解决一些随机问题，比如损坏的热水器、空调、洪水等。如果你身边没有一万元，那么一旦出现这些情况你的房子将成为无法居住。然后还有定期维护。就像津巴布韦的流浪民发现耕种一块农场一样，你需要投资和耕耘一块农场才能使其生产，它不会自动生产。住房也是一样，需要不断的投资来保持它们不会破败：园艺、修理房屋中的电线、新地毯等。
- en: Putting poor people into homes they can't afford leaves no one with both an
    incentive and ability to maintain it, and so such neighborhoods decay. Many inner
    cities have once beautiful homes that are now worthless, and though it doesn't
    happen overnight, the waste is rather pathetic. Better for everyone--neighbors,
    themselves--if they rent. After all, housing is not, primarily, an investment,
    but rather consumption item falling under 'shelter'.

- en: 'On one hand, this problem is solving itself as no one will buy paper with less
    than 20% down mortgages, on the other hand, there''s an exception: government
    guaranteed mortgages with only 3.5% down. The government guarantees 90% of mortgages
    today, which only prolongs the inevitable, and is a major reason why we aren''t
    out of our slump, because people are not being reallocated to their sustainable
    patterns of trade and consumption. This mispricing of risk is born by taxpayers
    and so, like Fannie and Freddie and the whole mortgage bubble, is an easy way
    for do-gooders to superficially address the problem. It may not have been obviously
    stupid in 2006, but it is now.'

  zh: 一方面，这个问题正在自行解决，因为没人会购买低于20%首付的抵押贷款的房产，另一方面，有一个例外情况：政府只提供3.5%首付的抵押贷款。如今政府担保了90%的抵押贷款，这只是延长了不可避免的结果，也是我们无法摆脱经济低迷的主要原因，因为人们并没有被重新分配到能够持续支撑贸易和消费的模式中。这种风险错误定价由纳税人承担，因此，就像房利美和房地美以及整个抵押贷款泡沫一样，这是做好事者表面上解决问题的简单方式。也许在2006年并不显得愚蠢，但现在却是愚蠢的。
