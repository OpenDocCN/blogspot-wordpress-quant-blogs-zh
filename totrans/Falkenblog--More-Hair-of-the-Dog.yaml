- en: When you have a hangover, one cure is to drink more, though this is clearly
    a short-term solution. Since the housing market began to falter in 2007, Washington
    has tried to help via foreclosure mitigation, increased guarantees from the FHA,
    higher guarantee thresholds from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Fed purchase of mortgage
    assets, and the $8,000 home buyer's tax credit. Yet housing, and the economy,
    remain in a slump. The people in unsustainable consumption and production, and
    everything around them, are not investing because they know there's no future
    for them.

    a no-brainer given what just happened.

- en: the first point of attack is on a proposal that would require sellers of mortgage-backed
    securities to retain part of the risk should a package of loans go sour. The sellers
    would have to keep on their books at least 5 percent of the value of any baskets
    of loans they purchase from lenders and then resell to investors. One of the few
    exceptions to the requirement would be for mortgages on which the home buyer has
    made a down payment equal to 20 percent of the purchase price.

    director in La Raza’s office of research, advocacy and legislation. “These rules
    will so significantly deter the ability of first-time buyers to break into the
    market that we will see a real decline in home ownership.”

    Homes require big cashflow investments for random problems such as broken water
    heaters, air conditioners, flooding. If you don''t have $10k lying around, your
    house is uninhabitable after such contingencies. Then there''s standard maintenance.
    As the Zimbabwean squatters found out with farming, you need to invest and cultivate
    a farm for it to be productive, it doesn''t just produce. So too with housing,
    as homes need constant investment just to keep them from falling apart: landscaping,
    fixing wiring in the house, new carpets, etc.'

    incentive and ability to maintain it, and so such neighborhoods decay. Many inner
    cities have once beautiful homes that are now worthless, and though it doesn't
    happen overnight, the waste is rather pathetic. Better for everyone--neighbors,
    themselves--if they rent. After all, housing is not, primarily, an investment,
    but rather consumption item falling under 'shelter'.

    than 20% down mortgages, on the other hand, there''s an exception: government
    guaranteed mortgages with only 3.5% down. The government guarantees 90% of mortgages
    today, which only prolongs the inevitable, and is a major reason why we aren''t
    out of our slump, because people are not being reallocated to their sustainable
    patterns of trade and consumption. This mispricing of risk is born by taxpayers
    and so, like Fannie and Freddie and the whole mortgage bubble, is an easy way
    for do-gooders to superficially address the problem. It may not have been obviously
    stupid in 2006, but it is now.'
