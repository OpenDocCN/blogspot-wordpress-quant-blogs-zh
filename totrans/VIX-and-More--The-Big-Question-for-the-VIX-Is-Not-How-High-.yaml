    25.00 for the first time since early 2003, I don’t believe that the big question
    should be how high it is going right now.  To my thinking, the more important
    question is how low it will sink once the current volatility storm has passed.'

- en: In looking at the weekly VIX chart below, keep in mind that the readings at
    the end of last year are at the very bottom of the range for the [17 years of
    VIX data](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/07/return-of-absolute-vix.html).  Also
    consider that many techniques used to evaluate stock charts have at best dubious
    cross application to the realm of volatility.  I am, however, a believer in the
    usefulness of support and resistance for the VIX and believe a strong case can
    be made for the new post-spike VIX floor to likely settle in the 13-15 range.  That
    number will undoubtedly seem high to those who are still mentally anchored in
    the recent experience of a [sub-10 VIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/sub-10).  It
    will also probably seem low to those who see [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures)
    trading around 21 all that way out to the June 2008 expiration.

    demonstrate that investors think it is safe to back into the water or tell us
    to expect the knee-jerk buying on the dips to be replaced by selling into rallies.  If
    the new VIX floor settles somewhere above 16 or so, I suspect we will slowly see
    a substantial thinning of the bull herd.'
