- en: Average U.S. buyout fund performance has exceeded that of public markets for
    most vintages for a long period of time. The outperformance versus the S&P 500
    averages 20% to 27% over the life of the fund and more than 3% per year. Average
    U.S. venture capital funds, on the other hand, outperformed public equities in
    the 1990s, but have underperformed public equities in the 2000s.

    from tail events, Knightian/Keynesian uncertainty. It highlights that merely noting
    an asset class is opaque and illiquid does not mean it generates an above-average
    return.  This is especially important because many pension funds are stretching
    to alternative assets (read: hedge funds) under the illusion that these areas
    have less clear data, so are riskier, therefore generate higher returns.'

    paper, you see it is all about what data to include, which to exclude, etc. It
    has very little to do with asymptotic standard errors, or overidentifying restrictions
    that are presented as the really important tool for empirical financial researchers
    in graduate school.

    on, and that data prior to 2000 was probably not the same as that afterward. That
    isn't an abstruse statistical issue.
