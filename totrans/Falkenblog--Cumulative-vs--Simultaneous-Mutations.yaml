    they often disagree by orders of magnitude. For example, [Doug Axe](https://bio-complexity.org/ojs/index.php/main/article/view/BIO-C.2010.1/BIO-C.2010.1)
    looked at a Beta-Lactamase enzyme and estimated that the ratio of amino acid permutations
    that would fold correctly and break down ampicillin is one in 10^77\. In contrast,
    evolutionists point to research that generates much larger likelihoods. Telomere
    discoverer and Nobelist [Jack Szostak and Anthony Keefe](https://www.nature.com/articles/35070613)
    estimated that the likelihood an 80-amino long protein can bind to inactivated
    ATP to be on the order of one in 10^12\. Most estimates are around 1 in 10^50,
    but some are as low as [one in a thousand](https://academic.oup.com/peds/article/15/7/619/1488462?login=false).

    While these researchers were looking at different proteins doing different things,
    they all thought their research was relevant to an essential question in evolutionary
    models: how smooth is the fitness landscape? To create new genes that created
    the original topoisomerase, or one of the 700 unique genes in both chimps and
    humans, it had to go from something—randomness, an existing or copied gene—to
    something new that aids fitness. Richard Dawkins portrays this as walking up a
    smooth hill behind what looks like an impenetrable cliff (*Climbing Mount Improbable*).
    This could be true, but not all peaks have smooth trails.  For example, assume
    an organism is at the blue dot in the graph above, where the x-axis represents
    a one-dimensional fitness landscape while the y-axis represents fitness (the fitness
    landscape was popularized by Sewall Wright in the 1930s).'

    model for all evolutionary processes, as various allele combinations generate
    different phenotypes. However, with the discovery of DNA genes are more like computer
    code than a mixture of baking ingredients, and proteins have specific folds, alpha
    and beta sheets, and binding sites with distinctive 3-d shapes and polarity. In
    this context, moving up a fitness landscape could involve leaps across chasms
    where multiple specific amino acids are needed in particular locations to be viable
    or better. In this case, a hill-climbing algorithm could get stuck forever at
    a local maximum, like the 500-million-year-old nautilus with its [pinhole-lens
    eye](https://archives.evergreen.edu/webpages/curricular/2011-2012/m2o1112/web/cephalopods.html)
    (its cephalopod cousin, the octopus, has a complex lens like a human).

    of Evolution*](https://www.amazon.com/The-Edge-of-Evolution-audiobook/dp/B000U88Z5Y),
    about the probability of generating multiple mutations that increase fitness.
    Behe noted the empirical likelihood of malaria developing chloroquine resistance
    is estimated at around 10^20, which was not disputed. The mutation rate of the
    malaria parasite *P. falciparum* is roughly 1 in 10^8 mutations per base pair
    per parasite. As there are 10^12 parasites in the human body on average, there
    are probably a thousand copies of every possible mutation to exist somewhere in
    each infected person. The resistance rate for atovaquone is 1 in 3 people, within
    an order of magnitude of what is expected. The probability of 10^20 suggests that
    malaria needs two mutations almost simultaneously, in that one alone is not common
    in the gene pool.

    [Miller](https://www.nature.com/articles/4471055a), [Moran](https://sandwalk.blogspot.com/2014/07/michael-behe-and-edge-of-evolution.html)).
    They argued that cumulative selection makes comparisons to monkeys typing Shakespeare,
    tornados assembling 747s in a junkyard, or two simultaneous mutations, all irrelevant.
    This assumption allows the belief that macroevolution is just microevolution over
    extended time frames. Notably, none of these critics proposed a model consistent
    with the 10^20 datapoint, whether the probability of n mutations scales at say,
    p/n vs. p^n. A couple of years after Behe's book was published, [researchers documented](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1322965111)
    that two mutations to the malarial PfCRT protein were necessary for chloroquine
    resistance. One mutation alone seemed deleterious as there were not many malaria
    with one of the needed mutations, ready to reach a new fitness level via the second
    one.

    in option pricing, such as the binomial options model of Cox-Ross-Rubinstein.
    A barrier option model is analogous to the situation where a proto-protein needs
    n specific amino acids to gain some new functionality. This approach shows how
    if you need n specific mutations to get some higher fitness level, the cumulative
    probability of getting these will be observationally equivalent to the likelihood
    of getting these mutations sequentially.

    all the paths to that node (Pascal's triangle). An organism moves rightward through
    the lattice with each mutation in its germ line. While this ignores heterozygosity,
    the point is to clarify the relative magnitudes of the cumulative vs. 'simultaneous'
    mutation; the refinement can be added later without loss of generalization.

    of the targeted functional protein. We terminate the lattice at this point because
    the organism's germ line generates the functionality of interest. In the case
    of malaria, at this point, it can withstand the chloroquine and grow exponentially
    within the host, and break free to enter another host.

    the case with 14 amino acids, and each level beneath the top row represents an
    increase in the number of amino acids needed to reach the target. It does not
    matter which amino acids are incorrect. For example, the initial state may need
    two specific mutations, but later on, the organism could be at a state where it
    requires two different mutations. These scenarios would have the same probability
    of reaching the target in this model.

    lattice. The probability of getting 1 of 2 specific acids is the same regardless
    of which amino acids do not match and what the pathway was to get there. The probability
    of moving up, p(u), goes down as one moves upward because the number of possible
    good mutations relative to the number of possible bad mutations goes down. For
    example, if initially, we need two specific changes, and with 424 aminos that
    means there are 8056 (422 times 19 amino acids) ways to move away from the target,
    and two ways to move towards the target, creating a 0.025% probability (2/(422·19+2))
    of moving towards the target. You can play with parameters in the excel sheet
    linked below.

    target protein. For example, one could argue that two specific mutations are needed,
    but only 212 of the other amino acids are necessary for functionality. In this
    case, we just change the number of total amino acids from the actual 424 to a
    'functional' 212, as the others are irrelevant.

    paths to the top row increases by a factor of 4 as one moves through time. In
    the chloroquine example, the top nodes represent all the combinations with two
    more up movements than down movements: up-up, up-down-up-up, etc. The probability
    of these successful paths declines by a factor of 0.001 because each path requires
    the extra p(u); a downward move implies an additional implausible upward move
    to get back to its earlier closeness to the target. The net probability--the number
    of paths times the probability, 4 × 0.001—therefore decreases by orders of magnitude
    at each step. Adding numbers that decline by an order of magnitude or more leaves
    the first digit unaffected, as when you add the numbers 0.01+0.0001+0.000001;
    the first term, 0.01, approximates the sum. In this way, the probability of a
    direct path number approximates the cumulative probability.'

    through time, the likelihood of two sequential specific mutations is equivalent
    to the probability of two simultaneous specific mutations. The direct sequence
    of mutations is precisely like the probability of a simultaneous mutation.

    how close one is to a target. The standard way of modeling probabilities ignores
    the pathways and looks at limits, obscuring this result.

    One can imagine all sorts of intermediate configurations of amino acids that are
    useful for something else, but that is not science unless one has a reasonable
    model or an empirical estimate of the ratio of these viable configurations to
    those possible. We all know that to turn a bicycle into a motorcycle you need
    several parts to work together. One can imagine each part being added without
    customers noticing, but one can also imagine a point where the thing does not
    work at all. To change an ion channel from one that lets only sodium across a
    membrane to one that allows only potassium, it too needs many specific mutations
    before it would work at either task. It could be there are many intermediate configurations
    that do something entirely different, but without any actual data, it takes a
    lot of faith to imagine these unseen functional intermediates are all buried in
    our past.

    flies, and *E. coli* shows nothing that would extrapolate to novel functionality.
    Instead, the more common involves loss of function. For example, losing melanin
    is advantageous for humans in northern latitudes because it allows humans to get
    more vitamin D. At the same time, the risk of skin cancer is lower with less sunlight,
    so the benefit of melanin is less. The sort of evolution we see all over within
    families like cats, dogs, and bears, however, does not explain how we got cats,
    dogs, and bears from a common ancestor.
