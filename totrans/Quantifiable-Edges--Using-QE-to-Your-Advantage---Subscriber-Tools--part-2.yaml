- en: '- Much of my market bias is determined by the studies I conduct and consider
    "active". The Aggregator is the tool I developed that weighs the estimates from
    those studies and gives me a bottom line bullish or bearish expectation. I also
    use a separate calculation called the Differential that measures recent market
    performance versus recent expectations. The Aggregator is the number one tool
    I use in determining my bias and setting up my index trades. More information
    on the Aggregator can be found by clicking the link below.'

    in either the blog, the subscriber letter, or both. Studies that appeared to me
    to either have a substantial edge or to be notable and worth reviewing in the
    future are included in the Quantifinder. The Quantifinder is an engine that examines
    the current day’s market action and determines whether any of about 900 studies
    would trigger based on today''s action. Any studies that appear pertinent are
    automatically referenced and a link is provided so that users can go back and
    read what I wrote about the current setup the last time it occurred. More detailed
    information on the Quantifinder can be found by clicking the link below.'

- en: '- Quantifiable Edges subscribers have access to 11 different mechanical systems.
    These systems are designed for trading either large cap stocks or ETFs. Each night
    I publish a spreadsheet that shows any stock among the S&P 500 or any ETF among
    the 100+ on my ETF list that has triggered one of the numbered systems. Each system
    has its own webpage that comes complete with detailed rules for entry and exit.
    Also on the webpage is Tradestation code for each system. Subscribers may take
    the code and use it for their own testing, or they may change it-using it as a
    starting point to develop one of their own systems. (Those who are interested
    in developing their own systems and testing across a large group of securities
    using Tradestation will find detailed instructions on the website on how to do
    so.)'

    research are available to subscribers for easy viewing in the archives section
    of the website. Many subscribers find themselves reviewing old letters thanks
    to being sent there by the Quantifinder, but if you feel current action is similar
    to something you''ve seen over the last few years and you want to see what research
    I was discussing then, you can simply pull up those letters on the archives page.'

- en: – The tool most utilized by subscribers is the nightly letter. It arrives nightly
    and is complete with my research and studies for the day along with my interpretation
    of recent studies. The Aggregator chart is always included and discussed, and
    the intermediate-term outlook is updated at least once per week. Additionally,
    it contains trade ideas that have been tracked and recorded over the last 3 years.
    It is not a tip-sheet, but the trade ideas, whether they are index trades, Catapult
    trades, or something else, have done quite well since the inception of the letter.
    They can all be found on the Trade Idea Results Spreadsheet, which is downloadable
    from the System page on the website by members at any time.

    the years, the majority of the enhancements have come on the website. How traders
    ultilize the research, the letter, the indicators, and the systems is up to them.
    There is a lot available. Hopefully this series of posts will help new and experienced
    readers alike to better take advantage of Quantifiable Edges, regardless of whether
    you have a subscription or whether you just read the blog.
