    asset allocation, model which uses trend following techniques as applied to commodity
    and global stock market prices to generates a composite Risk-On/Risk-Off signal
    (risk-on, risk-off or neutral). I have begun updating readers on the Trend Model
    signals on a weekly basis and via Twitter @humblestudent as new developments occur.

    the direction of the signal, which are indicated by the arrows, overlaid on top

    when the trend signal changed from negative to positive, as buy signals and the
    red down arrows, which occurred when the trend signal changed from positive to
    negative, as sell signals.

    a small account that traded long, inverse and leveraged ETFs on the major US market
    averages and, on occasion, sector and industry ETFs. Trading decisions were based
    on Trend Model signals combined with some short-term sentiment indicators. The
