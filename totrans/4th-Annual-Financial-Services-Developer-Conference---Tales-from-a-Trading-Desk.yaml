- en: I’ve blogged about this event [before](http://weblogs.asp.net/mdavey/archive/2005/09/23/425835.aspx).
    I’m surprised Microsoft doesn’t run a similar [conference](http://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/EventDetail.aspx?EventID=1032287389&Culture=en-US)
    in London, given the number of banks that reside over here. I’ve heard on a number
    of occasions that Microsoft is trying to push more into the lucrative financial
    services vertical, but all the [MSDN](http://blogs.msdn.com/) financial service
    bloggers appear to have gone quite :(. One thing’s for sure, the New York conference
    will probably be a good venue for consultancies to meet future hires, and make
    new contacts with future clients :).
