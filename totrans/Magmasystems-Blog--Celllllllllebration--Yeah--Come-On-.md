We have been given the go-ahead for the .NET Client Framework!

Thanks to all who contributed ideas, both publicly and privately. And thanks to various open-minded individuals at my IB.

My ex-colleague, Chris, will be embarking on an effort to do the same at another IB. Will it be Service Locator vs Spring.Net? Stay tuned!

Beers are on me.....
