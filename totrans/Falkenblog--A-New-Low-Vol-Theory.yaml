- en: Value and Size are common strategies based on the higher-than-average return
    to value and small cap stocks, and one can mention the value or size 'factor'
    that presumably causes this to happen without much explanation. It's a 'risk'
    factor to many, because small cap and value stocks generate statitical out-performance,
    which can only persist if there is risk associated with it.  As to what the risk
    of small cap and value stocks is, no one really knows. At first, it was thought
    to be financial distress risk, but then we discovered such firms have low returns
    when you measure distress directly, so that's not it. It's not volatility, or
    beta.

    something intuitively spookier about value and small caps vs. their opposites,
    so I wouldn't shut the door on that.

    simple absolute returns for various reasons, so I wont get into what they considered
    their main result. Instead, I want to talk about their mention of why there''s
    a low volatility premium. Here''s the first suggested explanation they offer for
    the existence of the low volatility anomaly:'
  prefs: []

- en: Should the anomaly be related to systematic risk, then the excess returns can
    be viewed as arising from some, as of yet unknown, common risk actor(s). For instance,
    Merton (1987) offers an explanation for why investors would demand higher returns
    for taking on higher IVOL.

- en: This is funny. They suggest one theory is that volatility demands a premium
    because it's risky when it's low (presumably, the CAPM beta holds as well, generating
    high and low risk to volatility as a factor, which, when you add a preference
    positive skew and aversion to negative skew, implies a great deal of nuance).
     Then they reference Merton, who's hypothesized back in the old days (1987) that
    idiosyncratic volatility was positively related to risk because idiosyncratic
    volatility should contain a lot of mismeasured risk factors. As a potential taste
    of why the low volatility anomaly exists, its not promising because it's got the
    wrong sign.

    risk factor (they were really that tentative) That is, low volatility did relatively
    well in the 2008 crash, relatively poorly in the 2009 rebound, worldwide, so,
    it''s correlated internationally, which means there''s potentially a risk factor
    that they are all reacting to.  Just to be clear, the Low Vol ''risk factor''
    went down a lot in 2008, and was really high for most of 2009, which I guess means
    the low vol risk factor is like the two-slit experiment in quantum physics: if
    you think you understand it, you don''t understand it.  .'

    but I think this is like introducing your new theory on influenza with an overview
    of the various goblins hypothesized to cause colds.  And indeed Li, Sullivan and
    García-Feijóo prefer their own new theory of market mispricing, which though in
    working paper since 2010 isn't on the internet, so who knows. Interestingly, while
    they mention Black (1972), making one think, this is a leverage story, they then
