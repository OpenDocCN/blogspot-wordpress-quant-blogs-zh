- en: A sad note that in every field, protocol is a prerequisite to substance. A paper
    not only needs to have a new point, but it must do so in a way that patronizes
    the methodology they all have uniquely mastered. A scientist is generally not
    someone who simply knows a lot about 'x', but also knows how his status tribe
    discuss such ideas. Whether its post modern philosophy or economic dynamics, the
    key is the methodology, because that is what defines who is relevant, because
    someone with good ideas, but who does not use your method, potentially trashes
    your human capital (eg, you mean my understanding of the difference between Brouwers'
    and Kakutani's fixed point theorems was wasted?).

    act this way, they themselves just care about truth, the scientific method, prediction,
    etc. It's true to some degree these attributes define what persists, and in that
    sense, is operative. But to get published, you need to play the game.

- en: When we submitted the paper to risk, uncertainty, and insurance journals, the
    referees responded that the results were self-evident. After some degree of frustration,
    my coauthor suggested that the problem with the paper might be that we had made
    the argument too easy to follow, and thus referees and editors were not sufficiently
    impressed. He said that he could make the paper more impressive by generalizing
    the model. While making the same point as the original paper, the new paper would
    be more mathematically elegant, and it would become absolutely impenetrable to
    most readers. The resulting paper had fifteen equations, two propositions and
    proofs, dozens of additional mathematical expressions, and a mathematical appendix
    containing nineteen equations and even more mathematical expressions. I personally
    could no longer understand the paper and I could not possibly present the paper
    alone.
