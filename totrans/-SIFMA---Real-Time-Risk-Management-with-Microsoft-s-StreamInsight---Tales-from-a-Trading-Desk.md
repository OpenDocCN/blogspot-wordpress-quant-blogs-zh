## @SIFMA – Real Time Risk Management with Microsoft’s StreamInsight

There was a pretty good turn out for the talk Torsten [Grabs](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/streaminsight/) (Microsoft [StreamInsight](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/streaminsight/)) and I did today at SIFMA – 50+ people. Slides available [here](http://www.slideshare.net/mattdotdavey/sifma-2010-june-23-real-time-risk-management-with-microsofts-streaminsight).
