- en: For all the talk about the auto bailout fiasco, a little more than two hours
    into the final trading session of the week finds the markets relatively unchanged
    since last Friday. As I type this the SPX is hovering around the 862 mark, down
    about 1.5% for the week.

- en: Interestingly enough, the VIX has also fallen this week and is currently down
    about 4.4% from last week’s close. In fact, the VIX is setting up for the [sixth
    close in a row of under 60](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/12/vix-closes-under-60-for-fourth.html)
    – the first time this has happened in over two months.

    to be back out in full force today, with technology, small caps, real estate and
    homebuilders catching a bid.

- en: As long as the VIX keeps dropping, it is reasonable to assume that buyers will
    continue to step in aggressively to support the market when it pulls back.

    pattern continues.
