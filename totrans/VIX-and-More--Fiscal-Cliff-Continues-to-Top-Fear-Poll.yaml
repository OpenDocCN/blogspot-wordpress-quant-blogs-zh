    cliff](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/fiscal%20cliff) negotiations,
    investors continue to cite the fiscal cliff as the largest threat to the stock
    market in the *VIX and More* weekly [fear poll](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Fear%20poll).
    [Fears](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/fear) related to government
    and politicians beat out concerns about excessive central bank intervention as
    the #2 issue, while anxiety related to the [European sovereign debt crisis](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/European%20sovereign%20debt%20crisis)
    finished in a tie for fourth.'

- en: The poll marked only the third time in nine weeks that U.S. and non-U.S. respondents
    agreed on the top threat and was the first time that U.S. and non-U.S. respondents
    placed the top two threats in the same order. In fact, agreement on the order
    of the threats was the same through the top three.

    gave more weight to the European sovereign debt crisis than non-U.S. respondents
    (the majority of whom are European), while non-U.S. respondents gave more weight
    to the fiscal cliff than U.S. respondents. In previous weeks, there had been strong
    evidence of regional myopia.

    a timetable to targeted unemployment and inflation rates, one might expect the
    balance of fear to tilt more in the direction of inflation or deflation this week.
    Instead, there was a notable jump in concerns over both inflation and deflation,
    particularly from U.S. respondents.

- en: It is reasonable to ask what might happen if there is a deal in the fiscal cliff
    in the next week or two. Will a deal also have a significant impact on concerns
    related to government and politicians or will concerns related to institutions
    persist and prove to be something more than an event-specific concern? Finally,
    if the fiscal cliff fears disappear with a deal, which new fears will bubble up
    to take its place? This week several respondents submitted write-in votes related
    to [high-frequency trading](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/high%20frequency%20trading)
    (HFT) and algorithmic trading. Will this be the next fear to stalk the stock market?
