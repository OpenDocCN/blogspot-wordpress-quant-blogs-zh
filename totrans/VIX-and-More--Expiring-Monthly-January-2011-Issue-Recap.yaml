    across the options landscape in 2010 and venture forth with predictions for the
    coming year in subjects ranging from macroeconomic issues to new products to the

    of the original interview feature. Mark Sebastian interviews author Sergey Izraylevich,
    whose recent book, *[Systematic Options Trading](http://www.amazon.com/Systematic-Options-Trading-Evaluating-Opportunities/dp/0137085494)*,
    is, as the title suggests, a comprehensive review of a systematic approach to
    trading options. Also, Jared Woodard sits down with Robert Krause and Charles
    Barwis of [The Volatility Exchange](http://www.volx.us/), a new exchange dedicated
    to realized volatility contracts for currencies, equities, commodities and interest
    rates whose first products will be launched on February 7^(th).

    details my thoughts on the options space in 2010 and includes a slew of predictions
    for 2011\. The second article is the conclusion of a two-part series about tweaking
    a “Swan Catcher” model I introduced last month. The intent of the Swan Catcher
    is to a position that should profit from extreme moves in the market, without
    losing too much money while one waits for these events to occur.
