- en: Consider an index of insider behavior calculated by the Vickers Weekly Insider
    Report, published by Argus Research, which is based on the ratio of shares sold
    by insiders to shares bought. Last week, according to the latest issue of the
    Vickers service, this ratio for NYSE-listed issues stood at 5.13-to-1\. The comparable
    ratio in early September was 5.97-to-1\.

    long-term average is between 2-to-1 and 2.5-to-1\. Vickers consider any ratio
    below this average to be bullish, and any number above it — like the current level
    — to be bearish.

    ratio got as low as 0.42-to-1, At the stock market’s low in early October of a
    year ago, at the bottom of that year’s summer/fall correction, the ratio got as
    low as 1.04-to1\.

    right now are selling between 5 and 13 times as many shares of their companies’
    stock — relative to how many they are buying — than they were at those important
    market lows.

    the bulls. But this elevated level of insider selling had been persisting for
    some time (see

    for the US consumer, compared to the bearish outlook exhibited by corporate executives.
    Yesterday's market action was a microcosm of this effect. IBM's earnings release
    prompted a bearish reaction, but the bullish macro backdrop of the blowout housing
    numbers overwhelmed the bearish tone from the IBM report.

    confidence with Manufacturers' new orders (green).

    environment of positive price momentum and Fed easing, falling business confidence,
    which will eventually translate to lower earnings, won't matter until valuations
    start to matter.
