    analyst. It isn't just about knowing the right technique or writing a better algorithm,
    though that is part of the skill set needed. What's more important is situational
    awareness - awareness of the investment environment that we live in so that we
    can deploy the right model to take advantage of the environment.

- en: From 1946 through early 2010, Eisenstadt worked with just one firm - Value Line,
    publisher of the Value Line Investment Survey. Hired as a proofreader after serving
    in the European theater during World War II, Sam moved over to research in production
    in 1948, then became the firm's Director of Statistics, and eventually ascended
    to Research Chairman. There he played a major role in developing the Value Line
    Timeliness Ranking System - referred to by many as the industry's first practical
    quantitative model for stock selection - and took charge of its weekly production.
    In 1971, the late Fischer Black wrote in the Financial Analysts' Journal that
    the Timeliness Ranking System was the one provable anomaly to the Efficient Market
    Hypothesis that he had found to-date. Never satisfied with past accomplishments,
    Sam continued to work on improving the Timeliness Ranking System while also developing
    a Technical Ranking System along. Other developmental work included various asset
    allocation models and indexes. Personal highlights include a debate with Professor
    Rex Sinquefeld and appearances on Wall Street Week with Louis Ruykeyser. ***One
    common thread is that everything Sam developed was data-driven, preferring to
    let the data speak for themselves rather than super-impose pre-conceived theories
    upon them. Sam holds a bachelor's degree in Statistics from the City College of
    New York.***

    of the Value Line Timeliness ranking system - which is used as proof by counterexample
    that the strong form of EMH does not hold. Yet the title of the talk is "My life
    as an empiricist", an illustration that it takes more than just an advanced degree
    in the hard sciences to be a quant.

- en: The game embeds a number of assumptions I would disagree with, but that seem
    telling. Short-term interest rates are your only policy tool. And their view of
    the transmission mechanism seems to be that inflation in QN is jointly determined
    by the change in inflation rate between QN-1 and QN-2 and the level of real output
    growth in QN-1\. But a change in interest rates affects output immediately. So
    ***if the inflation rate is rising, whether because of demand-side or supply-side
    factors, the only way to prevent it from spiraling out of control is to raise
    rates enough to reduce real output. If inflation is plugging along at your target
    level, then bad weather causes crop failures and food prices go up and output
    goes down, you need to raise interest rates.*** If you don’t raise rates, then
    what happens is that inflation momentum pushes inflation up further in the next
    quarter and then the hit to output fades away which further increases inflation.
    Then since there’s even more inflation built into the system, you need to undertake
    a bigger rate hike down the road to drive output growth down enough to get inflation
    under control.

    rates in the face of adverse supply shocks. It shouldn’t stun us that this is
    what the game says, since it’s how the ECB behaves in practice. But the consequences
    have been disastrous in practice and I’m not sure what theoretical support they
    think they have for this view of how the world works.

    matter. Having inflation close to 2 percent matters a little. But it matters more
    to be below 2% than to be close to the target. If forced to choose between full
    employment and 4.16% inflation and a years-long deflationary recession, choose
    the recession.

    very broad based and has to both train young people for existing jobs and for
    future jobs. We're trying to train people to be creative because they have to
    be very flexible in the kinds of jobs they might take on. We need to think about
    what the economy of the future will look like and what kinds of skills are easily
    transferable and there, at least I like to believe, we try very hard at universities
    to think about those kinds of issues.

    At Mitacs we run programs where we get graduate students to go into society and
    look for emerging research challenges. We get young people talking to companies
    about what kinds of challenges these companies are seeing.

    about their challenges and then we bring a student and professor in to articulate
    clearly what the problem is. Then the student spends part of the time at the company.
    Seeing the problem for yourself is very different from having someone explain
    it to you. So we get the student to go to the company site, understand the problem
    first-hand, and then spend time tapping all the creative minds at the university
    on all the different possible ways to solve it. To me that's really the best way
    to stimulate creativity.***
