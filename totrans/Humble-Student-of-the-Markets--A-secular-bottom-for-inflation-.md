# Humble Student of the Markets: A secular bottom for inflation?

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models**

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post,

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The

**Trend Model**

is an asset allocation model which applies trend following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or contraction (bearish)?"

My inner trader uses the

**trading component**

of the Trend Model to look for changes in the direction of the main Trend Model signal. A bullish Trend Model signal that gets less bullish is a trading "sell" signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading "buy" signal. The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. Past trading of the trading model has shown turnover rates of about 200% per month.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Buy equities*
*   Trend Model signal: Neutral*
*   Trading model: Bearish*

on weekends and tweet mid-week observations at @humblestudent. Subscribers will also receive email notices of any changes in my trading portfolio.

**Rising inflation = Secular commodity bull**

This chart has been floating around since July and was featured in a

[Marketwatch](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/if-this-ominous-pattern-holds-it-may-be-time-to-bail-stocks-and-load-up-on-commodities-2017-07-06)

article. While it is interesting from the viewpoint of a chartist, the stretched relationship between stocks and commodities is difficult to reconcile when seen through macro and fundamental lenses. Rising commodity prices require a sustained recovery in inflation, or a collapse in the value of financial assets. How is that possible in this era of inflation undershoot and pedal-to-the-metal central bank QE?

I think I found the answer, and it may be a signal of an inflection point in inflation, interest rates, and asset return patterns.
