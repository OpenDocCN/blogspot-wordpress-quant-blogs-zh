- en: The price action on Greek government bonds over the last couple of days has
    been staggering. I‚Äôve been watching the short end 2yr GGBs. Yesterday the yield
    went out from 14% in the morning, through 15% to 16% in the afternoon. This morning
    the yield hit 20% on the 2012 GGBs. At the time of writing it‚Äôs calmed down to
    17%. This compares to yields of 0.8 to 2% for benchmark EGBs, depending on coupon.

- en: For those not familiar with fixed income pricing, yields are inversely proportional
    to prices. Rising yields means falling prices. Prices are quotes as percentage
    of par. For benchmark German, French, Belgian or Dutch EGBs short end prices are
    ~99 to 105% of par. Bear in mind the coupons !¬† Those high GGB yields mean investors
    and speculators are only prepared to pay ~67% or 77% of par. Which reflects the
    market‚Äôs view of the default risk.
