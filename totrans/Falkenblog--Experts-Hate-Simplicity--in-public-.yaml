    universities tend to be most skeptical of IQ tests? I think not. Universities
    offer a costly, slow, unreliable intelligence-indicating product that competes
    directly with cheap, fast, more-reliable IQ tests. They are now in the business
    of educational credentialism. Harvard and Yale sell nicely printed sheets of paper
    called degrees that cost about $160,000 ($40,000 for tuition, room, board, and
    books per year for four years). To obtain the degree, one must demonstrate a decent
    level of conscientiousness, emotional stability, and openness in one’s coursework,
    but above all, one must have the intelligence to get admitted, based on SAT scores
    and high school grades. Thus, the Harvard degree is basically an IQ guarantee.

    pooh-pooh simple solutions, no matter how near-optimal. I remember monitoring
    our traders as a risk manager, and invariably a market maker would present himself
    as a savvy speculator, with great insights as to short term movements and longer
    term trends (these always are in opposite direction, so that way whatever happens
    falls to plan). Thus, if you said, ''all you do is buy stuff from retail goobs
    below the bid and sell above the ask, and make riskless profit'', you would never
    be in the circle of trust. Some things on the trade floor, known by everyone,
    are never stated openly, because phone clerks don''t get paid $200k+, while ''traders''
    do. But it was similar in the Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO) meetings, where
    you have a bunch of people picking a point in duration space, and smoothing earnings
    by selectively buying or selling something in the ''banking book'' which generates
    an immediate hit to the pnl even though its value was known for many moons. Such
    a task could be automated, but then the naked interest rate bets, earning manipulation,
    would be too transparent. So the ALCO''s purpose was to manage earnings, and take
    interest rate bets, in the most convoluted way possible using all the latest financial
    jargon: "we are seeking greater liability sensitivity in the current uncertain
    environment that suggests we synergistically position ourselves to maximize the
    risk sensitivity..."'

    you can't prove them wrong, though such a database is not nearly as special as
    they think (these are public firms, after all). I'm 97% sure their model does
    not significantly outperform a naive Merton Model, and that adding their liability
    adjustment, or their adjustment to historical volatility by looking at how the
    liability structure has changed, doesn't add up to anything significant. There
    is value to having a popular risk measure, however flawed, because it makes communication
    easier across parochial domains--there are economies of scale in validation and
    transparency--but that's not a very compelling sales pitch because then you don't
    have barriers to entry that would protect intangible assets. So the equilibrium
    tendency is to complicate things more than they should be, and highlight irrelevant
    nuances and vague principles, because then no one can copy you.

  zh: KMV始终可以指向他们的专有违约数据库，由于它是专有的，你无法证明他们错了，尽管这样的数据库并不像他们认为的那么特别（毕竟这些是公开公司）。我有97%的把握认为他们的模型并没有明显超出天真的默顿模型，而且通过查看负债结构的调整或历史波动性的调整来增加他们的责任调整并不会产生明显的影响。然而，拥有一个流行的风险度量方法确实有价值，尽管它存在缺陷，因为它使跨领域的沟通更加容易——验证和透明度有规模经济——但这不是一个非常令人信服的销售理由，因为那样你就没有能够保护无形资产的准入壁垒。因此，平衡的倾向是使事情变得比它们应该更复杂，并突出不相关的微妙和模糊的原则，因为这样就没有人能够模仿你。
