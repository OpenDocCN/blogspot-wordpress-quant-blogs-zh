    when analyzing complex data, because people tend see what they believe rather
    than vice versa. Thus, developing good prejudices is more important than developing
    good econometric skills, reminding one of Oscar Wilde's dictum that 'Education
    is an admirable thing, but is well to remember from time to time that nothing
    that is worth knowing can be taught.'

    conditional beta deciles are about 8% per annum, implying a profitable zero-cost portfolio
    that goes long stocks in the highest conditional beta decile and shorts stocks
    in the lowest conditional beta decile.

    nose at the volatility and accept the price for a higher return.  Yet, the risk
    and return are both lousy, so such a fund has never been popular.  Consider that the

    low volatility funds have done, among many real-world examples (eg, I wasn't [sued](http://www.efalken.com/papers/legaldocs.html)
    because low volatility **didn't** produce positive alpha).  Indeed, a glaring
    datapoint against the assertion that higher beta implies a higher return is the
    absence of a popular, explicitly high market beta fund, precisely because such
    stocks have had horrible returns. Consider there have been value and size portfolios
    even though these have high value and size risk, because they have higher-than-average
    returns.  As mentioned, if higher beta truly gave one a return premium, desperate investors
    like CalPERS would gladly take on the risk.

    sure they are super fresh and estimated with the much more sophisticated Maximum
    Likelihood method, as opposed to some simple matrix inversion. They correctly
    note that the CAPM, and any of its derivatives (the APT, the SDF), are conditional,
    and so theoretically you need to update your beta estimates constantly as conditions
    change.

    edge to doing something really tricky. Sure, you can do better than using the
    past 9 months of daily data using an exponential lag by adding some trickier refinements,
    but not much. The 36-month betas ubiquitous in the literature generate qualitatively
    similar outcomes for everything I've looked at, so that's not the key problem
    with the CAPM, any more than using the equal or value-weighted indices (also irrelevant).
    Indeed, their own paper shows their four different betas generate the same positive
    return to beta (a 4% annualized spread), only more so (8% annualized) if you update
    in more frequently than once a year.  So, their refinement doubles a return advantage
    that practitioners don't see.

    Now, daily returns are problematic ever since the first estimate of the size effect
    was found to be overstated by 15% (annually) due to daily rebalancing effects

    with returns, excluding the bottom dregs of penny stocks that add spurious precision
    but are untradeable (basically, I took the current $500MM cut-off, and applied
    that backwards in real terms). The data is over at

    rather than all that beta refinement so reminiscent of the 1980's focus on ever
    more sophisticated tests that produced nothing of lasting importance to anyone
