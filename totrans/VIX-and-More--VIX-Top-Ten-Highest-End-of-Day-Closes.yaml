- en: In [Top Five VIX Spikes](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/09/top-five-vix-spikes.html)
    below, I have detailed the highest VIX values attained in an intra-day basis.
    In the table below, I offer up the ten highest end of day closes in the VIX. Regarding
    the “event trigger,” the dividing line between the Russian financial crisis and
    the problems associated with [Long-Term Capital Management](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Long%20Term%20Capital%20Management)
    is somewhat arbitrary. For the sake of simplicity, I am counting September 21,
    1998 as the break point between the [Russian Financial Crisis](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Russian%20financial%20crisis)
    and public knowledge of the LTCM situation.

    reflect a short stretch of after hours activity.

    close for the VIX.
