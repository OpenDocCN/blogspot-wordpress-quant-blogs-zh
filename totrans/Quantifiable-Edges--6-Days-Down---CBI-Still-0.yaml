- en: The CBI looks for capitulative selling among S&P 100 stocks.  During market
    pullbacks it is common to see the CBI rise.  Very strong pullbacks will see higher
    readings, and as I have discussed many time before, readings of 10 or higher generally
    suggest a bounce is very near.  But with the market down 6 days in a row the CBI
    is still at 0.

- en: I looked back at other times the SPX closed down 6 days in a row.  There have
    only been 3 of them, which is just another example of how odd recent market action
    has been.  The other occurrences took place on 3/2/99, 8/1/11, and 11/23/11\.
     With only 3 instances it would be dangerous to try and draw a conclusion about
    the meaning, but the instances couldn't be much different anyway.  The '99 instance
    was quickly followed by solid gains.  The 8/11 instance was followed by a massive
    selloff that only ended after the CBI did spike, and the 11/11 instance was immediately
    followed by a very sharp rally.

- en: Not everything I look at is predictive, but that doesn't mean it is useless
    information.  While much of what I have been seeing suggests a bounce, knowing
    how unusual the setup is alerts you that the market is capable of just about anything,
    and the CBI example demonstrates that.
