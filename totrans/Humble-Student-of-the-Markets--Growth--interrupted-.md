# Humble Student of the Markets: Growth, interrupted?

Two weeks ago, I rhetorically asked if investors should be buying into the cyclical recovery theme (see [Buy the cyclical and reflation trade?](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2020/10/24/buy-the-cyclical-and-reflation-trade/)). Global green shoots of recovery were appearing, but I identified the "uncertainty of additional fiscal stimulus" as a key risk to the cyclical rebound thesis. Now that Biden appears to be winning the White House, but constrained by a Republican-controlled Senate, it's time to revisit the recovery question.

Regular readers know that I consider the global economy as three trade blocs, NAFTA, Europe, and Asia dominated by China. It is within that framework that I examine the global reflation question. 

Is the global economy emerging from a global recession?
