    measurably—adding intraday data. By doing this, you are combining some of the
    valuable information contained within intraday volatility. Think of it as a merger
    of ATR bands and Bollinger bands.  The calculation of the moving average  and
    standard deviation now contains all of the Open, High, Low, and Close data for
    the last 20 days. To test forecast error, if todays prices are between the upper
    and lower band, we will see what % of prices fall between the upper and lower
    band tommorow. All data is on the SPY (s&p500) looking back 3000 bars. Lets look
    at the results:'

- en: Average daily returns were much higher using the intraday DV Bands than the
    other methods. This is a 140% improvement over the baseline DV bands.  However,
    when looking at average daily returns above the mean, the DV Bands were not as
    effective at identifying oversold levels. This is not neccessarily bad at all……..in
    fact, it makes the upper band penetrations more likely to represent trend signals.
    Upward breakouts would contain less noise than using standard bands, or the DV
    Bands with closing data. This would be especially true if the bands were tight.

    look at adjusting the bands based on the mean reversion embedded in historical
    bandwidth. This should make the bands more reliable for countertrend trading,
    and they can also be redesigned to be superior breakout indicators as well by
    extension.

    and the adjustment of bands based on the current environment. In bear markets,
    prices rarely touch the standard upper bands, and tend to “walk the lower bands”
    with a high degree of frequency. The reverse is true with bull markets, where
    the upper bands can be “walked” for long periods of time. By adjusting for historical
    frequency, the bands are now adjusted to reflect the probabilities of the current
    marketplace. These “errors” so to speak, can also be minimized by investigating
    trend strength through the use of R-squared measurements over the last 20-days,
    and also the slope direction, and the slope of volume. Ultimately, bands that
    are adjusted using adaptive methods similar to the DVO, would prove to be even
    better. Furthermore, one could create bands designed for multiple trading purposes:
    1) trend-following 2) mean-reversion 3) breakout strategies and 4) filters for
    abnormality.'
