    especially true for US-based investors in light of the elevated valuations of
    US equities.

    the opportunities are, and where they're not. Geographically, the world is divided
    into three major trade blocs consisting of North America, Europe, and Asia, which
    is represented by Japan in the developed markets and China within emerging markets.
    For measurement purposes, the performance of each country or region is benchmarked
    to the MSCI All-Country World Index (ACWI) and returns are all measured in USD.

    market leaders. The US has been a mixed bag. The growth-heavy NASDAQ 100 had been
    going nowhere against ACWI since last summer. The S&P 500 weakened against ACWI
    in November, recovered, but it has consolidated sideways in the last two months.
    Of the other regions, Japan has been weak, and so has all of the emerging markets
    (EM). Europe has begun to perk up in the last month.

    from a technical analysis viewpoint for price signal indications of relative changes
    in growth patterns and outlooks.
