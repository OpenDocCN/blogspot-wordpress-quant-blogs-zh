    The reversals generated from these conditions the last two days have not been

    the January lows were severe enough that it remains plausible a significant bottom
    could have been made. I’ve obviously not yet given up on that idea. The market
    is in no-man’s land right now. Tests run tonight based on current action are showing
    no significant edge. Technically, a move above 1400 would signal the bulls are
    taking charge while a move below 1270 would signify the bears are still in control.
