    typical student would be much better off staying in college than dropping out.
    That would be the "safe" bet to make - and no doubt the decision that most parents

    an identifiable plan or path while they were undergraduates. As an example, Michael
    Dell was selling computers out of his dorm room. It helps that he had an entrepreneurial

    Houston Post in the summer. While making cold calls, he noted that the persons
    most likely to purchase subscriptions were those in the process of establishing
    permanent geographic and social presence; he then targeted this demographic group
    by collecting names from marriage and mortgage applications. Dell earned $18,000
