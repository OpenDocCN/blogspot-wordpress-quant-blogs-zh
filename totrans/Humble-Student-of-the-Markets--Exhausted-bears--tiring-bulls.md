# Humble Student of the Markets: Exhausted bears, tiring bulls

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2024/01/exhausted-bears-tiring-bulls.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2024/01/exhausted-bears-tiring-bulls.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models** 

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post, 

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The 

**Trend Asset Allocation Model**

 is an asset allocation model that applies trend-following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity prices. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. The performance and full details of a model portfolio based on the out-of-sample signals of the Trend Model can be found

[here](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/trend-model-report-card/)

.

My inner trader uses a 

**trading model**

, which is a blend of price momentum (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa). Subscribers receive real-time alerts of model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of the email alerts is updated weekly

. The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that began in March 2016 is shown below.

 The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Buy equities (Last changed from “sell” on 28-Jul-2023)*
*   Trend Model signal: Bullish (Last changed from “neutral” on 28-Jul-2023)*
*   Trading model: Neutral (Last changed from “bullish” on 02-Jan-2024)*

** The performance chart and model readings have been delayed by a week out of respect to our paying subscribers.***Update schedule**

: I generally update model readings on my

 on weekends. I am also on X/Twitter at @humblestudent. Subscribers receive real-time alerts of trading model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of those email alerts is shown

#### Bearish capitulation

Last week, I suggested that the current market environment “argues for a buy the dip and sell the rip posture in trading”. When the S&P 500 fell a miniscule -1.8% on an peak-to-trough intraday basis, my models were registering signs of bearish exhaustion, which was a sign to buy the dip.
How could a -1.8% intraday drawdown spark such oversold extremes? One inter-market clue came from Asia, where Chinese and Hong Kong stocks cratered on bad news out of China. The Hang Seng Index skidded -4.1% on Wednesday to a new 52-week low, and there wasn’t a single advancing issue. [Jason Goepfert](https://twitter.com/jasongoepfert/status/1747629048686108743)

of SentimenTrader found that such episodes tended to resolve bullishly. It was therefore no surprise that the Hong Kong market rebounded the next day, and so did the S&P 500.
