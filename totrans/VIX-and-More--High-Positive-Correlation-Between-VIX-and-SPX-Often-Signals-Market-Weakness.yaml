    various correlation metrics and have concluded that the period of high SPX-VIX
    correlation was focused primarily from April 25^(th) to May 10^(th) and reflected
    some high readings not seen since 1998\. One noteworthy aspect of the recent period
    of high correlation was its relatively long duration, again something that has
    not been observed in some of the correlation metrics since March and April of
    1998.

    of positively correlated SPX and VIX readings, the big correlation spike now appears
    to be in the rear view mirror, at least from a statistical perspective.

    the VIX, it is notable that the SPX generally performs well below its historical
    mean for up to three months following the high positive correlation period. I
    also find it particularly interesting that a period of significant underperformance
    is often associated with 20 trading days following the peak readings. If you consider
    April 25^(th) to be the first day of these peak readings, then knowing that tomorrow
    is day #20 should at least give you some fodder for contemplation.'

    is about to make a U-turn…but understand that it never hurts to be fully prepared
    for the possibility.
