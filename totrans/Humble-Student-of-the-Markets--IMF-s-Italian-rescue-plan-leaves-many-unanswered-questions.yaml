    money, which would need the approval of funding countries, including the US. At
    this point, I would more charitably say that the report of an IMF rescue of Italy
    leaves many unanswered questions.

    to lend to countries in trouble. The technical term is the fund’s “one year forward
    commitment capacity” which for “Q3 to date” is 246.0 billion SDRs ([September
    15 update](http://www.imf.org/external/np/tre/activity/2011/091511.htm); SDRs
    are “Special Drawing Rights”, which exist only at the IMF.) On September 20, 1
    SDR was worth 1.57154 US dollars, so the IMF could lend no more than 386 billion
    dollars — as one euro is worth about 1.37 US dollars this week, this is about
    280 billion euros.

    resources would have to come from IMF members, which will take time. The United
    States is one of the larger contributors to the IMF, which means that, were this
    measure to pass, the American taxpayer would be bailing out Italy. Would Obama
    give the nod to such a politically charged move just as he is entering a presidential
    election year?

    of the country.*** That’s just the way it works. When Italy borrows money from
    the IMF it automatically subordinates the existing creditors. Lenders hate this.
    They will vote with their feet and take a pass at Italian new debt issuance for
    a long time to come. Once the process starts, it will not end. There will be a
    snow ball of other creditors. That''s exactly what happened in the 80''s when
    Mexico failed; within a year two dozen other countries were forced to their debt
    knees. (I had a front row seat.)'
