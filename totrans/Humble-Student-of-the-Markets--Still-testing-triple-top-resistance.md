# Humble Student of the Markets: Still testing triple-top resistance

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2020/11/still-testing-triple-top-resistance.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2020/11/still-testing-triple-top-resistance.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models**

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post,

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The

**Trend Asset Allocation Model**

is an asset allocation model which applies trend following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or contraction (bearish)?"

My inner trader uses a

**trading model**

, which is a blend of price momentum (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa). Subscribers receive real-time alerts of model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of the email alerts are updated weekly

. The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that began in March 2016 is shown below.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Sell equities*
*   Trend Model signal: Neutral*
*   Trading model: Bullish*

** The performance chart and model readings have been delayed by a week out of respect to our paying subscribers.* **Update schedule**

**The bulls test triple-top resistance**

Last week, I highlighted the possible formation of a rare Zweig Breadth Thrust (ZBT) buy signal coupled with an S&P 500 test at triple-top resistance. As it turns out, equity breadth was not strong enough to trigger the ZBT buy signal. Despite making a marginal new all-time high, the S&P 500 is still effectively testing triple-top resistance.

What's next?
