    Conference (RMC) in Bonita Springs, Florida. Now that the conference is over and
    the CBOE has [posted](http://www.cboermc.com/agenda/) most of the presentations,
    I thought I would take a little time and offer a retrospective look at some of
    the content that caught my attention.

    whose indefatigable and prolific efforts were responsible for capturing many of
    the details of the conference. Russell’s posts and those of [Matt Moran](http://www.cboeoptionshub.com/author/matt-moran/)
    made it possible for anyone to have a virtual front-row seat throughout the proceedings.
    Their efforts in conjunction with the RMC are archived at the [CBOE Options Hub](http://www.cboeoptionshub.com/)
    with the [CBOERMC tag](http://www.cboeoptionshub.com/tag/cboermc/).

- en: From my vantage point, I thought it particularly interesting that the two keynote
    speakers, [Martin Zonis](http://www.chicagobooth.edu/gls/speakers/?speaker=zonis)
    and [Carl Tannenbaum](http://www.northerntrust.com/pws/jsp/display2.jsp?TYPE=bio&XML=contact/buscard/1216405007008_743.xml),
    had such divergent views about the potential risks and rewards in the U.S. financial
    markets in the coming years. Zonis placed most of his attention on political risk
    and foreign policy matters and declared that the markets were “underestimating
    volatility in future years.” While Tannenbaum expressed concern about banks in
    Europe as well as credit and real estate in China, he had a much more sanguine
    view of the future of the U.S. economy and financial markets.

    Deshpande provide an overview of the players and strategies used in volatility
    products during the course of the evolution of the VIX product platform. Deshpande
    described the [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures)
    as a mature market, with liquidity and supply having shifted from commercial to
    con-commercial traders. He also indicated that demand for VIX puts has stagnated,
    while new entrants are increasing the demand for VIX calls. All of this has influenced
    how the [VIX spikes](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20spikes)
    and [mean reverts](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/mean%20reversion),
    as well as how the VIX futures [term structure](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/term%20structure)
    has evolved.

- en: Another particularly interesting session involved Ed Tom and John-Mark Piampiano,
    who tackled the subject of the volatility of volatility, invoking the likes of
    [VVIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VVIX) as well as the third
    and fourth derivatives of SPX implied volatility. At every conference at least
    one session gives you things to mull over long after the speakers are done and
    for me, this was the session that hit the high notes. Ed Tom’s presentation has
    not yet been posted, but he started his talk by decomposing VIX risk premium into
    realized volatility plus skew plus kurtosis and went on from there.

- en: 'Sheldon Natenberg and Trevor Mottl were tasked with the subject of evaluating
    the volatility surface: skew and term structure. Not surprisingly, they were up
    to the task, with Mottl focusing on the role of money and credit in shaping the
    volatility surface. He indicated that the increasing size of the Fed’s balance
    sheet has depressed volatility across the board over the course of the past few
    years and expects that as the Fed’s balance sheet normalizes, the change in non-financial
    debt will become the most important influence on equity market volatility going
    forward. Mottl attributed the steepness of the VIX futures term structure to the
    uncertainty related to the Fed’s ability to be successful with its quantitative
    easing program. He also traced fluctuations in the skew of volatility to expectations
    related to the Fed’s tapering plans.'

- en: a panel on volatility as an asset class (the consensus that volatility is more
    of a tool and in order to be thought of as an asset class needs to harvestable,
    allocatable and easier to benchmark; a separate thread was critical of the costs
    associated with traditional approaches to tail hedges)

    derivatives, which had a detailed explanation of the VIX settlement process as
    well as a discussion of [VXST](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXST),
    which is expected to gain much more momentum when options on the index become
    available on April 10

    will be held September 3-5, just south of Dublin, Ireland.  Since all of my ancestors
    trace their roots back to Ireland, I can’t imagine a better place to hear about
    the latest thinking in volatility and ponder the miracle of Guinness draught at
    the same time.
