- en: ', or RRG charts, are a way of depicting the changes in leadership in different
    groups, such as sectors, countries or regions, or market factors. The charts are
    organized into four quadrants. The typical group rotation pattern occurs in a
    clockwise fashion. Leading groups (top right) deteriorate to weakening groups
    (bottom right), which then rotates to lagging groups (bottom left), which changes
    to improving groups (top left), and finally completes the cycle by improving to
    leading groups (top right) again.'

    are priced in USD and therefore all currency effects are already part of the returns.
    The rotation analysis was performed relative to MSCI All-Country World Index (ACWI).

    the leadership position again, after a brief hiatus. Emerging leadership can also
    be found in the resource producing countries of the world, such as Australia,
    Canada, Latin America, and Russia. European and Asian stocks, which had been the
    leaders, are starting to consolidate and they are likely to begin to weaken on
    a relative basis. These patterns are consistent with my thesis of a developing
    reflationary blow-off equity market top.
