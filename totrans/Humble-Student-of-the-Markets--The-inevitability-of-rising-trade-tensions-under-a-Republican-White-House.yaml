    in the US and around the world. Let's take an alternative view to perform our
    analysis. Imagine an alternative universe, where Donald Trump did not secure the
    GOP nomination in 2016, but another Republican went on to win the election. I
    am going to make the bold assertion that trade tensions would have risen in any
    case.

    the low hanging fruit from globalization and globalized supply chains has mostly
    been harvested. In addition, a Republican President would have enacted a tax cut,
    and the resulting fiscal stimulus would have created a positive growth differential
    with the rest of the world and pushed up the USD. The combination of shrinking
    benefits from globalization and a rising exchange rate would inevitably heighten
    trade tensions.
