- en: Bullish early-month seasonal tendencies have been well documented both here
    and elsewhere.  But what happens if we close the month at a high?  Does that sap
    some of the typical early-month strength?  Or is the market more likely to continue
    higher?  Below I show all instances since 1995 where the SPY finished a month
    with the highest closing price of that month.

    there is some follow through into week 2.
