- en: '**Mid-week market update:** I recently pointed out that the S&P 500 was becoming
    overbought and poised for a consolidation or pullback. The 14-day RSI had reached
    the overbought zone and the percentage of S&P 500 stocks above their 20 dma exceeded
    90%. The market tried to rally today, but failed. Is this the correction?'

    the market could consolidate sideways (time).
