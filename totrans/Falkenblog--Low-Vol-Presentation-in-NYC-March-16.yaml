    $50 at the door. That's not close to me, so I won't be going, but looks interesting.

    in the last financial crisis. But his white paper had a rather nuanced view of
    the data I found almost nonsensical, such as when DB wrote "the strategy does
    not actually position itself so that low-volatility stocks outperform; instead
    it aligns itself so that lower risk portfolios outperform." I don't think the
    MVP portfolio, with short positions, is the essence of the anomaly, rather, the
    simply flat to negative beta/vol relation to returns. As I said, I think they're
    gilding the lily.
