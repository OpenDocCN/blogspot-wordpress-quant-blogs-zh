    fundamental and transitory volatility. Fundamental volatility is due to unexpected
    changes in the fundamental values of instruments, and transitory volatility is
    due to impatient traders trading market orders. Bid/ask bounce is a form of transitory
    volatility. When you see bid/ask bounce in a market you’ll see the prices at the
    top of book tick up,down,up,down constantly, usually in a one tick range.

- en: A good place to observe this in fixed income is Eurex futures. The front month
    contracts for Schatz, Bobl, Bund and Buxl (2,5,10,30 yrs) are the most heavily
    traded contracts in the Euro rates world. A lot of the trades on these contracts
    are hedges on cash bond positions. The traders hedging their cash  positions will
    take whatever prices are showing at the top N levels in order to hedge, so they
    match Harris’ characterisation of impatient market order traders.
