- en: It has been a tough week for the banks, but particularly for Bank of America
    ([BAC](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/BAC)), where the company’s
    recent struggles have earned it a stint in the spotlight as this week’s [chart
    of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week).

    of Merrill Lynch and other questionable moves, BAC ~~extorted~~ received secretive
    Treasury funding of $20 billion in addition to guarantees of up to $118 billion
    for toxic assets.

    prevent the wholesale nationalization of the banking system.

    but makes the case that in some respects, January has been the worst month yet,
    at least for Bank of America.
