    when modeling. Just because you have a useful tool doesn’t mean that you should
    use it on everything.

    literature, but what is the economic basis for seasonality on sectors and industries
    like Consumer Staples, Utilities and Biotech? What about small cap growth and
    value?

    sector, why does the seasonal effect for natural gas not coincide with Energy
    stocks? Are their fundamental drivers that different?

    industries. We found that there was a weak seasonal effect for US retailers around
    Black Friday. In addition, turn-of-year effects have been cited by many researchers
    in many markets around the world.

    a universal tool. Don’t fall into the trap that if you have a hammer, every problem
    looks like a nail.
