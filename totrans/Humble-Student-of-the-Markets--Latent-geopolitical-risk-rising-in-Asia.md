As we wait for the 2Q GDP and FOMC announcement, here is something different to ponder...

essay warning that Japanese Prime Minister's Abe's "makeover of Japanese foreign policy could undermine the fragile power balances that have so far kept the Sino-American rivalry in check", largely because "opposition to any perceived revival of Japanese militarism is hard-wired in Northeast Asia". Evans warned:
