    they conform neatly to analysis using linear regression. This is because of the
    lack of stationarity as well as a healthy degree of noise relative to the underlying
    relationships within the data. It is therefore strange that the conventional practice
    is to use classical statistics and linear optimization methods for portfolio allocation
    or indicators for that matter. This point has been stressed many times on the
    blog, and I cannot stress it enough: you need to use as few assumptions as possible
    when working with financial data in order to create useful tools or applications.
    This means that you should be using percentiles/histograms and other nonparametric
    statistics as the cornerstone of your analysis. It is ludicrous to draw up mathematical
    proofs as the basis for how you will allocate capital as is the case with modern
    portfolio theory and CAPM. Yet this is the standard somehow in asset management
    in the real world– it is therefore not surprising that financial companies underestimate
    risk and “blow up.”  In other industries a more practical approach is taken to
    solve complex problems. The military doesn’t depend on fixed equations to guide
    missles to their targets otherwise they would be highly inaccurate. There are
    too many variables such as wind, pressure and temperature to account for that
    make a fixed solution impractical.  Allowing for non-linear statistics with the
    use of recursion to improve estimation is absolutely essential for various forms
    of modern “rocket science”. Why should allocating capital be any different?'

    inputs that are incorporated into calculations. The correlation coefficient is
    one of the prime offenders because it is most effective when there is a linear
    relationship between two variables. Anyone with experience with running regressions
    on financial market data will understand that strong linear relationships are
    few and far between. Often a cluster of dots expressing a financial relationship
    is more dense in some areas than others, and the relationship tends to have non-linear
    qualities. The best way to measure this type of correlation is to use a non-parametric
    variant called the Spearman Correlation [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman’s_rank_correlation_coefficient](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman's_rank_correlation_coefficient)
    . Effectively the Spearman correlation uses ranks instead of the raw data to discern
    the relationship. This permits the actual relationship to be any type of shape,
    but if it is systematic than the coefficient will be high- much like the regular
    correlation coefficient.

    with different assets as well as individual trading strategies. In this case,
    we performed a Kelly Portfolio Optimization using the covariance matrix and returns
    on the 9 sector ETFs (SPYDERS) that comprise the S&P500\. For those that have
    worked with the SPYDERS, they are very noisy and do not yield many systematic
    effects. We chose a 3-year window (756-day) for the correlation and CAGR inputs
    which is long-term and thus reflective of classic portfolio allocation but also
    useful especially for strategy allocation (think RSI2, moving averages etc). Across
    a variety of allocation exercises with different parameters the Spearman correlation
    was consistently superior to the conventional Pearson correlation.

- en: Below is a performance summary that shows that the Spearman covariance was substantially
    more useful in the portfolio allocation exercise. Using shorter-term lookbacks
    such as 252-day for CAGR and 60-day for correlation yielded the same conclusion.
    The results were even more pronounced on other asset classes as well as strategy
    allocation. While the Spearman itself can be substantially improved, in its basic
    form it is a nice improvement. As they say in cooking– “all it takes to improve
    a classic recipe is superior ingredients.” CSS has been doing extensive research
    into creating superior versions of classic portfolio allocation inputs—expect
    more to come.
