    together, inspire kids, especially kids of color. Clearly, having hope is important,
    and a leader who can inspire kids is an attractive quality by itself, even if
    its all based on smarmy quotes from Successories.

    merely figureheads, but making important decisions. The famous account of Nixon
    winning his debate with Kennedy according to radio listeners, but losing just
    as much according to TV viewers, highlights the importance of nonverbal communication.

- en: 'In 1973 a group of academics noticed that student ratings of teachers often
    seemed to depend more on personality than educational content. They wanted to
    find out how far this effect could be stretched: what if you had an impressive,
    charismatic and witty lecturer, who knew nothing at all about the subject on which
    they were lecturing? Could plausibility alone make an audience feel satisfied
    that they had learned something, even if the information delivered was deliberately
    inconsistent, irrelevant, and even meaningless?'

    called him “Dr Myron L Fox” and he was given a long, impressive, and fictitious
    CV. Dr Fox was an authority on the application of mathematics to human behavior.

    His audience was made up of psychologics, psychiatrists, mental health educators,
    and graduate students. The title of his lecture was Mathematical Game Theory as
    Applied to Physician Education. Dr Fox filled his lecture and his question and
    answer session with double talk, jargon, dubious neologisms, non sequiturs, and
    contradictory statements. This was interspersed with humor and 'meaningless references
    to unrelated topics'.

- en: The study serves as an example to educators that their effectiveness must be
    evaluated beyond the satisfaction with which students view them and raises the
    possibility of training actors to give "legitimate" lectures as an innovative
    approach toward effective education. The authors conclude by emphasizing that
    student satisfaction with learning may represent little more than the illusion
    of having learned.

    is highly overrated. And democracy is about giving the people what they vote for
