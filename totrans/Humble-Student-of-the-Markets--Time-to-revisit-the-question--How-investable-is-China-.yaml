- en: There were some questions raised about the investability of China last year
    as regulatory uncertainty rose amidst some market turmoil. Fast forward to today, The
    MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 20% from its October low and technically entered
    a new bull market. Enthusiasm is rising on the prospect of China's abandonment
    of its zero COVID policy and reopening its economy.
