    mine of global growth and inflationary expectations. The canaries are not behaving
    well, as shown by the chart of the CRB Index below. Commodity prices have broken
    out from a steady uptrend and they are now testing a critical support level. I
    am now watching to see if those key support levels hold.

    of global growth expectations, EEM has already violated an initial support level,

    the markets have the echoes of 2008 here. Then, we had a commodity price blowoff,
    just as we do now. Then, we had looming macro risks overhanging the market, just
    as we have now. Consider, for example, John Maudlin's excellent explanation of
