    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    signal. A bullish Trend Model signal that gets less bullish is a trading "sell"
    signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading
    "buy" signal. The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of
    the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. The turnover rate
    of the trading model is high, and it has varied between 150% to 200% per month.

    the 10-year yield is near the top of its 5-year range, indicating slightly equities
    are cheap relative to Treasuries. On a 10-year perspective, however, the forward
    P/E is above its historical range and so is the 10-year yield. Depending on your
    time horizon, valuations are either slightly cheap or slightly expensive, but
    levels are nothing to panic over.
