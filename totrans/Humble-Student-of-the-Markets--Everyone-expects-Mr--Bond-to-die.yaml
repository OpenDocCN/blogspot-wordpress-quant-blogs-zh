- en: Increasingly, there has been more and more bearish calls for bond prices (and
    bullish calls for bond yields) as the Fed continues its rate normalization program.
    Some analysts have pointed out a nascent inverse head and shoulders formation
    on the 30-year yield (TYX). With the caveat that head and shoulders formations
    are never complete until the neckline is broken, a decisive upside breakout in
    TYX would be bad news for long Treasury prices.

    are unlikely to rise as much as expected, and they may actually decline slightly
    from current levels.
