For any new readers from

[choice/locked](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lockedmarket.asp)

(the same) or inverted (higher bid than the current ask).  If you would like me to discuss any stocks or futures in particular in this regard, please

[email me](mailto:enrightblog@gmail.com)

with their symbol(s). 

*[ETF/Futures Arbitrage Series: FXB and 6B](http://frontrunthedelta.blogspot.com/2011/07/etf-futures-arbitrage-fxb-and-gbp.html)*

: An exciting analysis of what has previously been touched on

[here](http://rogerenright.blogspot.com/2011/07/reading-between-lines-of-allston.html)

, and a topic I hope will be a regular here on Front-Run the Delta.

[*How Knight Makes a Market*](http://frontrunthedelta.blogspot.com/2011/07/how-knight-makes-market-evidence-from.html)

:

[Knight Capital](http://www.knight.com/)

(

[KCG](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=KCG:US)

) is an active participant in OTC and Pink sheet markets.  This post will deconstruct how exactly Knight and it's competitors are able to make a market in certain stocks around the world.
