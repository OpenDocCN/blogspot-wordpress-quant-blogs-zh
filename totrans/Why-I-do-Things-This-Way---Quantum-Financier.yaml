    a self-proclaimed value investor. I didn’t know any better and I figured; if it
    worked for Warren Buffet, it ought to work for me. So I read and read on the subject
    and a little later I was being introduced to financial theory in school; time
    vale of money, benefits of diversification and all that jazz. At that point I
    felt like the planets aligned, making money and the market was easy, we only had
    to consider companies as a series of future cash flows. I then learned to do fundamental
    valuation: discounted cash flow models, comparables analysis, financial ratios
    regression et. al. However it never really did it for me, I was always left with
    questions unanswered.'

  zh: 我必须承认一些事情。我开始我的投资之旅时是一个自封的价值投资者。我不知道有更好的方法，我想；如果沃伦·巴菲特成功了，那我也应该成功。所以我阅读了关于这个主题的文章，后来我在学校里也接触到了金融理论；时间价值、分散化的好处等等。在那个时候，我感觉到了天地之间的契合，赚钱和市场变得轻而易举，我们只需要将公司视为一系列未来的现金流。然后我学会了进行基本估值：贴现现金流模型、可比公司分析、财务比率回归等等。然而，这些对我来说从未真正起作用，我总是有很多问题没有答案。

    of those mythical investors that could predict the future with a single look at
    a chart. Looking forward to gain this level of perception, I started looking into
    visual chart analysis. At first I must say I was baffled by what appeared to be
    doodles on the chart. I remember that at some point early on someone was trying
    to persuade me that if my chart was forming a tea cup I found myself a pattern
    to trade on. I must admit I was perplexed. Nonetheless I stuck through and passed
    the stage of chart reader and graduated to the indicator stage. Then things started
    to look more appealing to me, I particularly liked how each indicator would put
    a specific aspect of a stock price series to the foreground and reducing the noise.
    However I couldn’t seem to find a way to use these indicators to develop a way
    to make money. Decidedly reaching the $1M mark before 25 years old was going to
    be more complicated than I had forecasted when I was younger.

  zh: 寻找对我更有吸引力的场所时，我总是听说那些神秘的投资者，他们只需一眼看图表就能预测未来。期待达到这种感知水平，我开始研究视觉图表分析。一开始，我必须承认，我对图表上的所谓涂鸦感到困惑。我记得早期有人试图说服我，如果我的图表形成一个茶杯，我就找到了一个交易模式。我必须承认我感到困惑。尽管如此，我坚持了下来，从图表阅读者的阶段毕业到指标阶段。然后事情开始对我更有吸引力，我特别喜欢每个指标都会将股价序列的特定方面置于前景，并减少噪音。然而，我似乎找不到一种方法来利用这些指标开发赚钱的方式。毫无疑问，我在25岁之前达到100万美元的目标要比我年轻时预测的要复杂得多。
- en: Then one day I came across the blogs on my blogroll; I was hooked. The method
    used in these blogs just made all the puzzle pieces fit together. They wouldn’t
    discredit any method per se but would question the methods, the underlying assumptions,
    and would use an outside the box thinking approach to answer question left unanswered.
    Rather than being strictly technical or fundamental, they would use quantitative
    methods to analyse the market and rigorously evaluate phenomenons. This no fad,
    down to earth and based on the scientific approach was exactly was I was looking
    for all this time without knowing it. While I am nowhere near the $1M mark, I
    have grown from an absolute approach trader to a seeing the shades of grey. Instead
    of looking for the Holy Grail strategy or approach, I now strive to constantly
    get better and get answers to my questions.

  zh: 然后有一天，我偶然看到了我的博客列表上的博客；我被吸引住了。这些博客中使用的方法让所有的难题都迎刃而解。它们不会否定任何方法本身，但会质疑方法、基本假设，并采用超越常规的思维方式来回答那些无解的问题。它们不仅仅是严格的技术分析或基本面分析，还会使用定量方法来分析市场，严谨评估现象。这种不是一时流行，脚踏实地、基于科学方法的方式正是我一直在寻找但不知道的。虽然我离100万美元还差得远，但我已经从绝对主义交易者变成了看到灰色地带的人。我不再寻找圣杯般的策略或方法，而是努力不断提升自己，寻找问题的答案。
- en: If you are a reader of my blog, I also assume you follow these blogs, and the
    one true great thing I hope you get away from it is not that new strategy published
    that scores a 40% annualized return in the backtest, or that awesome new indicator
    that outperforms this and that. Above all else, I hope that what you get from
    our blogosphere community is the desire to investigate and to constantly improve
    your trading. And that my friends, is the only way to succeed; and no fundamental
    or technical school of thoughts will ever give you that if you just blindly follow
    it without questioning the underlying principles.

  zh: 如果你是我的博客读者，我也假设你关注这些博客，我希望你从中得到的不是新的策略在回测中获得了40%年化回报，或者超越了其他指标的那个令人惊叹的新指标。最重要的是，我希望你从我们的博客社区中得到的是对交易的渴望去探究和不断改进。我的朋友们，这是唯一成功的途径；如果你只是盲目地遵循而不去质疑其基本原则，任何基本或技术的思想都不会给你这种能力。
