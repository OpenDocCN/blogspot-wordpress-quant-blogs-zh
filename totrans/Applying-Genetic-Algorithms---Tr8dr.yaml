- en: I have done some experimentation with genetic algorithms in the past, but am
    now looking to incorporate as an optimization tool into my rules-based strategy
    framework.

- en: The behavior of our strategies are often parameterized. There can be so many
    combinations of parameters, that to arrive at a sucessful or best performing set
    can be a matter of guesswork, testing and retesting.

- en: Enter Genetic Algorithms (GA). GA allows us to efficiently arrive at a (nearly)
    best fit set of parameters based on a fitness function. For those not familiar
    with genetic algorithms (GA), GA is a biology-inspired gene/generational means
    of evolving a solution based on fitness criteria. A population of genes is produced
    on each generation, the fittest of which are chosen and recombined with other
    genes. Successive generations will tend to be more and more fit, arriving at a
    fitness maximum.

- en: In truth GA, as exotic as it sounds, is just one of many optimization techniques
    where one is trying to minimize, maximize, or find a zero for a complex function.
    GA is easy to set up and can work with black-box functions, so is a good candidate.

    computation required. For each day we evaluate a strategy will be looking at 200K
    – 500K ticks or more. So to evaluate over, say, 3 months of data is 30 million
    ticks. Multiply this by 1000 or more fitness evaluations, and one is looking to
    evaluate billions of ticks and rules.

    and the strategy engine for this infrastructure.
