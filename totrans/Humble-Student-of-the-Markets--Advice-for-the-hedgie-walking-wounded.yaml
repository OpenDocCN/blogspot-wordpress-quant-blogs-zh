    16% YTD (to early October) and they were exhibiting current drawdown of about
    17%. Convertible Arbitrage, Equity Long/Short and Event Driven strategies were
    the worst performing strategies with average current drawdowns of over 20% each.
    Moreover, there have also been stories floating around that even some large brand
    name hedge funds are down 10-15% YTD.

    Here is another example. This was a strategy that I was heavily involved in developing
    for an equity market neutral portfolio. The chart below shows the out of sample
    returns of two stock selection models.

- en: Model A is a bottom-up derived multi-factor model with an average holding period
    of 1-2 months. Even though the process was bottom-up oriented, it acquired decided
    top-down trend following like characteristics (which was extremely powerful during
    the backtest period). My solution was to complement Model A with Model B, a short-term
    price reversal model with an average holding period of 4-5 days. The portfolio
    returns, which consist of a 67% weight in Model A and 33% in Model B, are less
    volatile.

    one would expect that the trend following/momentum Model A and the price reverting
    Model B to have a correlation of close to -1\. In fact, their rolling correlations
    have fluctuated around the zero line over the out of sample period.

    were stable in the panic market selloff last week and subsequent rally on Monday.

    for a long/short equity manager. He had shown very good returns over the years
    but results were volatile.

    time, he may latch onto one or more interesting investment themes, e.g. biotech,
    emerging markets, etc., and make a big bet on any one of those themes. The result
    was a long/short equity portfolio with a decidedly long bias.

    risk. While long term returns were excellent, the fund suffered large draw-downs
    in bear markets. Our solution was to sizably reduce market and common factor risk
    in the portfolio, as the manager admittedly didn’t have any market timing ability.
    We used standard risk models, from Barra and from Northfield, to estimate the
    factor exposures of the portfolio in order to form a hedge and overlay on top
    of the actual portfolio. The chart below shows the returns of the original portfolio
    and a portfolio hedged using ETFs, such as ETFs on the S&P 500, Russell 2000,
    as well as country and sector ETFs.

    portfolio over the simulation period outperformed the original unhedged portfolio
    by 3%. The hedged portfolio avoided much of the drawdown experienced by the unhedged
    portfolio and outperformed both the S&P 500 and the HFR Equity Hedge Index. In
    addition, the hedged portfolio had superior risk characteristics as it avoided
    much of the drawdown in the bear market after the Tech Bubble top of 2000.
