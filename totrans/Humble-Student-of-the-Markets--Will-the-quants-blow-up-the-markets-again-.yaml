    the meltdown was very ugly. Long-only quantitative accounts with relatively low
    turnover portfolios suddenly saw relative performance tank to -10% to -15% against
    their benchmarks in a matter of days, as per the above chart. Moreover, factors
    that were uncorrelated by design, e.g. value vs. growth, all suddenly saw their
    return correlations converge to 1.

    “BLOW-UP”. To him the most important component to quantitative trading was not
    the creation of a good model. To him, amazingly, that was a challenge but not
    especially difficult. The real challenge, for him, was to “sniff out” the degrading
    model prior to its inevitable “BLOW-UP”. And I quote his humble, resolute observation
    “because, you know, eventually they ALL blow-up“…as most did in August 2007.

    models with a little bit of growth, a little bit of value, sprinkle in some momentum
    (fundamental in the form of estimate revision and earnings surprise), technical
    in the form of PRICE momentum, usually some form of relative strength with a one-month
    price reversal. They might toss in other exotic ingredients like insider trading
    activity or buybacks. These multi-factor models used uncorrelated factors by design,

    narrowed the opportunity set…meaning, usually, not enough tickers were regularly
    generated [through the filter] to absorb enough capital to tilt the performance
    meter at most large hedge funds…as position size was very limited [1-2% maximum].
    The leaders wanted the model to be the hero not just a handful of stocks. So the
    variables had to be reduced and optimized. Seemingly redundant indicators [for
    the filter] were re-tested and “tossed” and, as expected, the reduced variables
    increased the population set of tickers…but it also ramped the incremental volatility…which
    was considered very bad. In order to re-dampen the volatility capital limits on
    portfolio slant and sector concentration, were initiated. Sometimes market neutral
    but usually never more than net 30% exposure in one direction and most sectors
    could never comprise more than 5% of the entire portfolio. We used to joke that
    these portfolios were so neutered that it might be impossible for them to actually
    generate any meaningfully positive returns. At the time of “production” they actually
    did seem, at least as a model, “UN-BLOW-UP-ABLE” considering all the capital controls,

- en: Using the simulated returns of long/short equity portfolios based on five valuation
    factors, we find evidence that the “Quant Meltdown” of August 2007 began in July
    and continued until the end of 2007\. We simulate a high-frequency marketmaking
    strategy, which exhibited significant losses during the week of August 6, 2007,
    but was profitable before and after, suggesting that the dislocation was due to
    market-wide de-leveraging and a sudden withdrawal of marketmaking risk capital
    starting August 8\. We identify two unwinds—one on August 1 starting at 10:45am
    and ending at 11:30am, and a second at the open on August 6, ending at 1:00pm—that
    began with stocks in the financial sector, long book-to-market, and short earnings
    momentum.

    2007 were due to the forced liquidation of one or more large equity market-neutral
    portfolios, primarily to raise cash or reduce leverage, and the subsequent price
    impact of this massive and sudden unwinding caused other similarly constructed
    portfolios to experience losses. These losses, in turn, caused other funds to
    deleverage their portfolios, yielding additional price impact that led to further
    losses, more deleveraging, and so on. As with Long Term Capital Management (LTCM)
    and other fixed-income arbitrage funds in August 1998, the deadly feedback loop
    of coordinated forced liquidations leading to deterioration of collateral value
    took hold during the second week of August 2007, ultimately resulting in the collapse
    of a number of quantitative equity market-neutral managers, and double-digit losses
    for many others.
