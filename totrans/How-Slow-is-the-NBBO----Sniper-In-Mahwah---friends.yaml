    "Don’t cry for “the little guy on Wall Street”") for his Reuters blog, and something
    was weird. A the beginning of the paper, Salmon talks about [another article](http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2013/08/30/latency-arbitrage-costs/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=pulsenews
    "Make $377,000 trading Apple in one day") I missed, by Rob Curran for *Fortune*.
    Curran writes : “Terrence Hendershott, a professor at the Haas business school
    at the University of California at Berkeley, wanted to find out. He was recently
    given access to high-speed trading technology by tech firm Redline Trading Solutions.”
    I have read a lot of Hendershott’s papers, so I knew that the study reported by
    Curran was published on July 8, 2013, in a paper called “How Slow is the NBBO?
    A Comparison with Direct Exchange Feeds”. I was surprised because the title of
    the paper was not mentioned by Curran, nor the link to the Berkeley website where
    I got the file as soon as it was published online (Salmon seems surprised too:
    “This study is never named, or quoted, or linked to, and I can’t find it on Hendershott’s
    web page,”).'

    old school guy). So I printed the paper around July 20, but I did not read it
    immediately. I read it just after Nasdaq turned Nasdark on Friday 23 August (because
    the SIP and NBBO was involved in the outage, I thought that some issues could
    be discussed in the paper). On that day the paper was still on the Berkeley website
    because I shorted the link through bit.ly in order to send this tweet to some
    guys (don’t know if they read it):'

    website… but the file was gone. So, the paper has vanished between August 23 and
    August 30\. My first question was: why? Is it because the paper is quoted in Curran’s
    article? Is it because of the sensational title “Make $377,000 trading Apple in
    one day”? Is it because the Nasdaq went dark–so discussions about the NBBO were
    banned?'

    have to act like a high frequency trader: find it before cancellation! So, here
    is the [HowSlowIsTheNBBO](https://sniperinmahwah.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/howslowisthenbbo.pdf) PDF
    file. I don’t really have the time to discuss about it, the three writers had
    access (through Redline Trading) to the data feed of BZX & BZY exchanges by co-locating
    a computer in Weehawken. Sometimes the paper states the obvious, sometimes other
    facts are interesting. Perhaps Felix Salmon could find answers to the questions
    he asked, and perhaps other #hft addicts may find arguments.'

    academic event about hft far better than the TradeTech things), but “it will not
    be broadcast”, unlike other talks–in order to spare sensitive questions? Andrei
    Kirilenko made a [talk](http://www.birs.ca/events/2013/5-day-workshops/13w5008/videos/watch/201309021412-Kirilenko.mp4)
    yesterday, but was not very convincing.
