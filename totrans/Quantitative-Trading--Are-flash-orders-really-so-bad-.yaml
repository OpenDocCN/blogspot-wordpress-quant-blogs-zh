    issued to various potential market makers/liquidity providers, not unlike the
    usual "request for quotes" (RFQ) common in other industries. They are issued when
    there is not enough liquidity on a specific exchange to satisfy an investor's
    need, and they ultimately benefit investors by lowering their transaction costs.
    The fact that high frequency traders are able to make lots of money by providing
    this liquidity is besides the point. Liquidity providers are

    and thus benefiting this investor, hoping that the prices will come down in the
    future after this liquidity need subsides. This is manifestly not illegal. This
    is what a market is built for!

- en: Another way to understand that flash orders are not at all front running is
    that anybody, including you and me, are free to put in limit orders at the same
    price as those of the high frequency traders, way ahead of time, in a specific
    exchange, and become liquidity providers ourselves. You don't have to wait for
    a "request for liquidity" before doing so. And presumably you will reap the same
    benefits as the high frequency traders. You are not taking any additional risks
    over the HF traders either, since if no requests for liquidity ultimately arrive,
    you are not any worse off for wear. You cannot begrudge the profits of the HF
    traders just because you didn't put the limit orders in place beforehand!
