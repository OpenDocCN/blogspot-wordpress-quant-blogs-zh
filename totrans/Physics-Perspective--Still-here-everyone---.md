# Physics Perspective: Still here everyone...

> 来源：[http://physicsoffinance.blogspot.com/2012/04/still-here-everyone.html#0001-01-01](http://physicsoffinance.blogspot.com/2012/04/still-here-everyone.html#0001-01-01)

Sorry I haven't managed to post anything now for quite some time. All the result of lots of travel to various scientific meetings -- including one fascinating event on non-equilibrium economics -- and a MAD effort to get my book done on time. Deadline is effectively NOW!!!!!

So I haven't been able to afford any time to blog. But I will be posting more soon. And I have Bloomberg pieces appearing once a month (with one due out now in the next couple of days).

Meanwhile, Satajit Das

[has an excellent deconstruction](http://www.wilmott.com/blogs/satyajitdas/index.cfm/2012/3/19/Pravda-on-Financial-Innovation)

of a recent article in

*The Economist*

that could (may?) have been written by the financial industry itself, arguing why financial innovation is indeed such a wonderful thing, making the world more prosperous, stable, etc (have you heard that before?).
