- en: Given that I have been banging the drum about [VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX)
    (iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN) since the [day it was launched](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/01/first-day-of-trading-in-vxx-and-vxz.html),
    now that volatility is showing some signs of coming back to life and VXX regularly
    trades 10-20 million shares per day, I thought it would be appropriate to provide
    a comparison of the performance of VXX and VIX.

    of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week)
    should come as no surprise. Sure, volatility has been falling with almost unprecedented
    regularity over the course of the last 14 months, but VXX has been falling at
    a much faster rate than the VIX. In the last year, VXX has fallen at about twice
    the rate of the VIX, with the difference between the two accelerating over the
    course of the last 6-9 months.

    for the underperformance of VXX are the [term structure](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/term%20structure)
    of [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures), [contango](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/contango)
    and negative [roll yield](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/roll%20yield).

    Play](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/10/why-vxx-is-not-good-short-term-or-long.html)

    offering a more detailed explanation of what is driving the gap in performance
    between VXX and the VIX. An even more thorough discussion of VXX can be found
    in *The VIX ETNs: VXX and VXZ*, in the March 2010 issue of [Expiring Monthly](http://www.expiringmonthly.com/).'
