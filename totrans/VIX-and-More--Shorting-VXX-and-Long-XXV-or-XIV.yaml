    note to feature some of it here from time to time and today seems like a good
    day to kick things off. The reason for my enthusiasm is a post from this morning
    called [Case Solved: No Arbitrage](http://onlyvix.blogspot.com/2011/01/case-solved-no-arbitrage.html),
    which follows a previous post on the subject: [VXX-XXV Arbitrage?](http://onlyvix.blogspot.com/2011/01/vxx-xxv-arbitrage.html)'

    advisability of shorting [VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX)
    and some of the obstacles in being able to execute such a strategy successfully.
    With the arrival of [XXV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XXV), some
    investors thought that the inverse version of VXX might be a better way to accomplish
    the same goal. As it turns out, XXV has not performed as well as a short VXX position
    and *Case Solved: No Arbitrage* dives into the math and reverse engineers an excellent
    formula for calculating just how XXV performs relative to a short VXX position.
    I highly recommend clicking through to review the details.'

    my [subscriber newsletter](http://vixandmoresubscriber.blogspot.com/), that the
    VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term ETN ([XIV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XIV))
    is a better product for replicating a short VXX position than XXV. Investors have
    yet to arrive at the same conclusion as I have that 2011 will mark “the runaway
    success of [VIX-based ETNs and ETFs](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20ETN),
    notably the recently launched XIV, which will prove that volatility vehicles can
    be good buy-and-hold investments,” but I am standing by my [prediction](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/12/vix-and-more-and-2011-bespoke.html)
    and watching with interest to see how long it takes for money to start flowing
    into XIV.
