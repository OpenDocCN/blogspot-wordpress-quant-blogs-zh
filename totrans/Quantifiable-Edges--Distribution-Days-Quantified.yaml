    It was popularized by Investors Business Daily. The essential idea is that when
    the market falls on increasing volume that suggests institutions are selling stock.
    When clusters of distribution days occur, it is a topping signal. Below are some
    quotes from

    (the NYSE composite, the Nasdaq, the S&P 500 or Dow industrials) falls more than
    0.2% in higher volume than in the prior session, that''s a distribution day.'

    institutional investors — is dumping shares. That's bad news for the little guy,
    because institutions make up roughly three-fourths of the market and chart its
    direction.

    over a few weeks during an uptrend, that's a red flag.”

    wrong take on the market''s direction. Then you''ll be wrong about every move
    you make. That''s a nice recipe for financial agony…Once distribution days pile
    up, it''s wise to scale back your portfolio. Ease off margin, and get rid of any
    laggard stocks first. Raise cash and move entirely off stocks if necessary.”*'

    distribution days occur within a fairly short time period, you should begin selling
    stocks. The market is likely heading for a tumble. Let’s take a quantified look
    at it.

    do often occur near market tops – so they got that part right. But are they predictive
    of a top and should they be used for purposes of early identification?

    in the original test based on information at that time. It still seems like a
    good number according to the above article that suggests “a series of three to
    five distribution days over a few weeks during an uptrend, that's a red flag.”

    of distribution is NOT a good time to be selling. What if we flip the study on
    its head and instead BUY after such instances when distribution day counters are
    unloading positions?

    a decent edge nonetheless. Wins are bigger than losses and the winning percentage
    is pretty good. This makes for decent looking profit factors (gross gains / gross
    losses = profit factor).

    recent years it has failed? That might explain why IBD has discussed it for so
    long. Sadly, no. Below is the equity curve for the 1st test above using a 20-day

    days. Therefore, when a top actually does occur, the service or person who talks
    about their importance can point to the top and say “See, the distribution days
    signaled it. You would’ve been fine if you’d just used this tool.”

    to follow through days for calling market bottoms. They occur there, but they
    are not predictive and are pretty much a worthless tool. For detail on follow
    through days, you may refer to

    a pullback after an extended uptrend, it’s often a buying opportunity and NOT
