# Magmasystems Blog: LinkedIn Groups Created By Headhunters

> 来源：[http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2009/12/linkedin-groups-created-by-headhunters.html#0001-01-01](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2009/12/linkedin-groups-created-by-headhunters.html#0001-01-01)

I have noticed that Headhunters who operate in a particular space in Capital Markets or have a job opening in a certain area will create LinkedIn groups for the sole purpose of identifying candidates. I never join groups that have been created by a headhunter unless they are personally recommended to me.

For me, LinkedIn is becoming a bit like the Wild West, and its usefulness will be diluted by recruiters who misuse the service.

Thoughts?
