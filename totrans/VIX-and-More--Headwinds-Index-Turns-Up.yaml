    you are not likely to be in top form – not to mention [setting world records](http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/olympics/2008-08/21/content_6955715.htm)
    – running into a headwind.  For that reason, last month I developed something
    I call the [Headwinds Index](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/headwinds%20index)
    to calibrate the extent to which oil prices and concerns about financial institutions
    are providing a drag on stock prices.'

    is calculated as the price of crude oil divided by the financial sector ETF ([XLF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLF)).  For
    various reasons, I used the [USO](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/USO)
    crude oil ETF instead of the crude oil front month futures.

    presented in [Headwinds Index:  How Long Can Financials Outperform Energy?](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/07/headwinds-index-how-long-can-financials.html)
    now includes a 100 day simple moving average for the USO:XLF ratio and a 50 day
    SMA for the SPX mini-graph at the top. [I have also inverted the ratio to better
    align with the headwinds metaphor.]  Note that the 100 day SMA served as support
    for the Headwinds Index last week and the current level is at the 50 day SMA,
    which is a potential area of resistance.  If this index breaks above 5.0, I would
    expect to see a rush to re-implement many of those long oil and short financials
    momentum trades.'

    in a rising SPX on a number of occasions.  Keep an eye on this divergence going
    forward, as I do not expect to see a sustained rally in the S&P 500 until financials
    are able to outperform energy on a relative basis.
