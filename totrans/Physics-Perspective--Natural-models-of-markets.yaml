  zh: 勒巴隆首先概述了他称之为“金融市场主要谜团”的一些内容，这与我刚才提到的事物直接相关。首先是简单的波动性的存在：
- en: Volatility is the most obvious and probably the most important puzzle in finance.
    Why do financial prices and foreign exchange rates move around so much relative
    to other macro series both on a short term and long term basis? The difficulty
    of overall financial volatility was first demonstrated in Shiller (1981), and
    an update is in Shiller (2003). The issue has been that it is difficult to find
    financial or macro economic fundamentals that move around enough to justify the
    large swings observed in financial markets. As a potential policy problem, and
    an issue for long range investors, this might be the most important puzzle faced
    by financial modelers.

  zh: 波动性是金融领域最明显，也可能是最重要的谜团。为什么金融价格和外汇汇率相对于其他宏观系列在短期和长期基础上波动如此之大？金融波动性的整体困难首次在希勒（1981年）中得到证明，更新见希勒（2003年）。问题在于很难找到足够多的金融或宏观经济基本面来解释观察到的金融市场的大幅波动。作为一个潜在的政策问题，以及长期投资者的问题，这可能是金融模型师面临的最重要的难题。
- en: 'As Le Baron notes, lots of models (ARCH, GARCH, etc) have been produced which
    reproduce the mathematical character of volatility but without even attempting
    to understanding its origin. Moreover, most models in traditional economics, by
    sticking to the view that individuals are more or less identical and have rational
    expectations, simply shy away from the very phenomenon needing to be modeled:'

  zh: 正如勒巴伦所指出的，许多模型（如ARCH、GARCH等）已经产生，这些模型能够复现波动率的数学特性，但并没有试图去理解其根源。而且，在传统经济学中，大多数模型由于坚持认为个体大致相同且具有理性预期，从而完全回避了需要建模的非常现象：
- en: The persistence of volatility in many financial markets has led to an entire
    industry of models, and is an area of intense interest both in academic and commercial
    areas. However, although there is a lot of empirical activity, the underlying
    microeconomic motives for volatility persistence are still not well understood.
    There are very few models which have even tackled this problem. This is probably
    due to the fact that in a homogeneous agent framework this is simply a very difficult
    problem.

  zh: 勒巴伦列举的市场第二个难题我已经在上面提到过：市场回报的“肥尾”现象或者在统计学行话中所谓的“过度峰度”：
- en: Financial returns at relatively high frequencies (less than one month) are not
    normally distributed. There is not much of a strong theoretical reason that they
    need to be, but the hope has often been that some form of the central limit theorem
    should drive returns close to normality when aggregated over time. Recently, a
    new field, Econophysics, has appeared which stresses that returns also have additional
    structure that can be described using power laws. The determination and testing
    of power laws remains a somewhat open area, and the set of processes that generate
    acceptable power law pictures is also not well understood.

  zh: 在相对较高频率（不到一个月）的金融回报并不呈正态分布。它们不需要呈正态分布有一个强有力的理论原因，但是常常寄希望于中心极限定理能够在时间累积后使回报接近正态分布。最近，一个新的领域——经济物理学出现，强调回报还具有其他可以通过幂律描述的结构。幂律的确定和检验仍然是一个相对开放的领域，产生可接受幂律图像的过程集合也不是很好理解。
- en: Aside from the long memory of volatility and fat tailed returns, he also mentions
    the rich dynamics of trading volume, which is equally as interesting as those
    of prices. Unfortunately, when it comes to the dynamics of volume, Le Baron notes,
    "Most traditional financial models remain completely silent."

  zh: 除了波动率的长记忆和回报的肥尾现象外，他还提到了交易量的丰富动态，这一点和价格的动态一样有趣。不幸的是，勒巴伦指出，当涉及到交易量的动态时，“大多数传统金融模型仍然保持沉默。”
- en: 'Le Baron rightly points out that these rich dynamics in time are almost certainly
    linked directly to two things: 1) the fact that different market participants
    have different expectations at any moment (indeed, it is such differences which
    drive trading) and 2) that these differences undergo perpetual evolution through
    time. This suggests that a decent explanation of the origin of these so-called
    "stylised facts" (and others like them) will likely emerge from models which attempt
    to follow and capture something about the dynamics of beliefs and expectations

  zh: 勒巴伦正确地指出，这些时间上的丰富动态几乎肯定与两件事直接相关：1）不同市场参与者在任何时刻有不同的预期（实际上，正是这些差异推动了交易）和2）这些差异随时间不断演变。这表明，对于这些所谓“风格化事实”的起源（以及类似的事实）的合理解释，很可能源自于那些试图跟踪和捕捉关于在多样化互动个体群体中信念和预期动态的模型：
- en: Many of the most puzzling results from finance deal with problems of behavioral
    heterogeneity, and the dynamics of heterogeneity. The study of market heterogeneity
    as a kind of complicated dynamic state variable that needs to be modeled is probably
    one of the defining features of agent-based models. Empirical features such as
    trading volume are directly related to the amount of heterogeneity in the market,
    and demand models that can speak to this issue. Other empirical features are probably
    indirectly related. Large moves, excess kurtosis, and market crashes all probably
    stem from some type of strategy correlation that keeps the law of large numbers
    from functioning well across the market. These changing patterns can only be explored
    in a framework that allows agent strategies to adapt and adjust over time...

- en: I think this point about the failure of the law of large numbers is, while obvious,
    still worth emphasizing. Something in the market ruins the simple picture of normal
    statistics, which would emerge from independent factors driving prices changes.
    Somehow the actions of different market participants must come to be correlated,
    thereby leading to non-normal fat tailed returns and long memory effects. In principle,

    anything but banal. Yet many economists seem determined to continue modelling
    markets as if this were not the case. I don't know enough economic history to

- en: 'The rest of Le Baron''s review explores an example of the kind of model --
    an agent based model for a market very much out of equilibrium -- which reproduces
    the above features quite naturally, at least qualitatively. The idea is simply
    to respect the fact that agents in a market are different and change their behaviour
    over time, adapting to what happens in the market. There is no presupposition
    that market prices must settle down to an equilibrium; the market does what it
    does as people interact and trade and try to profit as well as they can. The simple
    model explored here is one developed by Le Baron in 2002, but shares basic features
    with many other models developed by others. Agents can choose between a risky
    asset (a stock) and a risk free bond, and they use a variety of information to

- en: Agents chose over a set of portfolio strategies that map current asset market
    information into a recommended portfolio fraction of wealth in the risky asset.
    This fraction can vary from zero to one since short selling and borrowing are
    not allowed. Information includes lagged returns, dividend price ratios, and several
    trend indicators. Agents must evaluate rules using past performance, and it is
    in this dimension where they are assumed to be heterogeneous. Agents use differing
    amounts of past information to evaluate rules. In other words, they have different
    memory lengths when it comes to evaluating strategies. Some agents use 30 years
    worth of data, while others might use only 6 months. In this way this model implements
