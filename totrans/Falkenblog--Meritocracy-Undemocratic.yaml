- en: the belief that meritocracy is horrible because it is antidemocratic. Millman
    seems to think that just because merit can't be measured infallibly it should
    be ignored. Further, he seems to think society is currently 'run' by an elite
    chosen by some Star Chamber according to some merit metric; I tend to think many
    leaders are simply popular people who learn how to navigate reverse dominance
    hierarchies, and these leaders are pretty widely distributed--politicians at many
    levels, businessmen who compete against each other.

    merit is considered meaningless.
