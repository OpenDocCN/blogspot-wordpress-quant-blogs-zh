    In that post, I had shown this chart from Ed Yardeni indicating that forward 12-month
    EPS estimates were declining and but suggested that they would recover once the
    Street started to see and quantify the benefits of lower oil prices (annotations
    in purple are mine).

    large cap SP 500 and the mid and small cap stocks are quite striking. While forward
    EPS for large caps have been falling, EPS estimates for mid and small caps are
    flat.

    are more exposed to the headwinds of a strong US Dollar. If the investment thesis
    is to focus on the benefits of lower oil prices to the US consumer, a more targeted
    way of getting that exposure would be to focus on the US mid and small cap stocks,
    which have less foreign exposure.

    2000 to the large cap SP 500\. The small to large cap ratio recently turned up
    as it reached the bottom of a trading range that began in 2010 and these conditions
    are suggestive of better small cap performance.

    are dependent on the outlook for the USD. As the chart below shows, the USD Index
    is making a rounded multi-year bottom and it is now testing a key resistance zone.

    several quarters ahead of most of the other major economies. Barring a major surprise,
    the Federal Reserve will likely hike rates around the middle of the year, while
    the economies in Europe and Japan need more stimulus.

    economies continue to struggle, while US job growth continues. There are preliminary
    signs that labor costs are beginning to rise, helped by rising wages. This is
    expected to continue to underpin US consumption.

    seen in the April-September period. It also seems unreasonable to think that the
    drop in oil prices, lower interest rates, and weaker currencies will not have
    a positive impact on Europe and Japan. It will take some time. In the meantime,
    the divergence theme is the focus and this bodes well for the greenback.

    mid cap stocks are likely to see better earnings growth as they reap the residual
    benefits of past USD strength. During the first half of 2015, I would be inclined
    to tilt my US equity exposure away from the large cap multi-nationals and toward
    the smaller domestically focused companies.
