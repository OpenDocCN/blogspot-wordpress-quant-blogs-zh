So [Dresdner has finally been sold](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7591181.stm) to [Commerzbank](https://www.commerzbank.com/) by [Allianz](http://www.allianz.com/en/index.html).

*   [Digital Markets](http://www.finextra.com/fullstory.asp?id=14206): the DKW etrading, emarkets, eeverythin initiative

I know quite a few folk who went to DKW and confirmed that they were early adopters. But of course, attention grabbing early adoption isn’t a reliable indicator of success…
