- en: As you can see the closer it gets to the opening bell the harder it bursts,
    and the further away from the best bid/ask it bursts. But... is it adding or removing
    shares at that price level?

- en: Above is the share delta for ticks on the buy side, where positive is adding
    shares to the book at that price level - clearly its adding.

- en: So whats it doing? clearly its layering orders vertically across the entire
    book, presumably at prices that would be very attractive should they get matched
    - e.g. highly passive strategy. But... why so close to the opening bell? Guessing
    theres also a spamming component to this. Where if theres 50K ticks in the queue
    to process, all at different price levels your orderbook has no choice but to
    update everything and thus, quite possibly, delay your snapshot of the world by
    100`s of ticks after the first execution.

    on here.
