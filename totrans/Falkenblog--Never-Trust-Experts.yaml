    a dominant alternative to ignorance and superstition. At the cutting edge, however,
    it's all about seeing what you believe, so it's mainly a trick of knowing what
    to prove, because a clever person can prove anything.

    is how it is supposed to be, any identifiable return premium should be explainable
    in terms of risk alone.

    in global FX volatility. This factor is a proxy for changes in market volatility
    suggested by the ICAPM theory, and is the analogue of the aggregate volatility
    risk factor used by [Ang, Hodrick, Xing, and Zhang (2006)](http://www.afajof.org/afa/forthcoming/ang1.pdf)
    for pricing the cross section of stock returns. We show that global FX volatility
    is indeed a pervasive risk factor in the cross-section of FX excess returns.'

    standard framework. We use the risk factor 'innovations in volatility', which
    has been shown a relevant pricing factor back in 2006". The problem is that the
    paper referenced showed that high volatility innovation is correlated with lower
    returns. Further, higher volatility ex-innovation is correlated with lower returns.
    Indeed, the 'volatility innovations' ruse is clearly an attempt to torture the
    data to tell it what the authors wanted. Here, the risk premium actually makes
    sense (if you believe their results, and I'm skeptical they are robust as the
    carry trade did well in years like 2001-2002, and poorly in 1997-2000; there isn't
    as much data as you might think; eyeball below and see if it looks like returns
    are positively correlated with 'good times'). If volatility innovation is a priced
    risk factor, it doesn't make sense in general because in other markets volatility
    and things correlated with it are inversely related to returns.

    with proxies of their marginal utility. So, when convoluted tendentious drivel
    like this shows up again and again, it is considered serious research. I say,
    it's only interesting to academics if you believe the risk-premium theory (99%+
    economists).
