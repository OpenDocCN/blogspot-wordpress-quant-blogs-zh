    level (red line), bounced off a Fibo support level and rallied to test the (red)
    relative resistance level. Should the sector weaken further on a relative basis,
    it would be bad news for the bulls.

    a measure of the reflation trade, the Materials sector approached a relative resistance
    level and backed off. It's now testing a relative uptrend line. Similar to the
    Financials relative performance chart, should Materials fail at the relative uptrend,
    it would be another indication that this bull move is over, at least for the duration.

    the relative chart tell a similar story. The group remains in a relative uptrend
    but it has retreated and is now testing the uptrend line.

    of days will be important signs for the health of the bull.
