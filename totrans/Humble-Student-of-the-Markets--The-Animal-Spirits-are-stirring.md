# Humble Student of the Markets: The Animal Spirits are stirring

**Mid-week market update**

: In light of Monday`s Zweig Breadth Thrust signal, I thought I would do one of my periodic sector reviews to analyze both sector leadership and the implications for stock market direction.

As a reminder,

[Relative Rotation Graphs](http://stockcharts.com/docs/doku.php?st=rrg&id=other-tools:rrg-charts)

, or RRG charts, are a way of depicting the changes in leadership in different groups, such as sectors, countries or regions, or market factors. The charts are organized into four quadrants. The typical group rotation pattern occurs in a clockwise fashion. Leading groups (top right) deteriorate to weakening groups (bottom right), which then rotates to lagging groups (bottom left), which changes to improving groups (top left), and finally completes the cycle by improving to leading groups (top right) again.

A review of the latest RRG chart shows a market in a bottoming process, with defensive sector leadership starting to roll over, and selected high beta and cyclically sensitive sectors becoming the emerging market leaders. While defensive sectors such as the Consumer Staples, Healthcare, REITs, and Utilities, are in the leading quadrant, they are losing relative strength. By contrast, Communication Services, led by selected FAANG stocks and high beta names, and Materials appear to be poised to become the next market leaders.

**A Special Announcement**

We told you so. We told you the market was going down.

Here is the track of

***Humble Student of the Markets***

, where we are neither perma-bulls nor perma-bears. Most recently, we have been correctly bullish since the correction of 2015, and turned cautious in August 2018 (see

[Market top ahead? My inner investor turns cautious,](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2018/08/05/major-top-ahead-my-inner-investor-turns-cautious/)

August 5, 2018).

We were also timely at the 2009 bottom. We issued a call to buy beaten up low-priced stocks with high insider buying a week before the ultimate bottom (see

 February 24, 2009).
