# Quantifiable Edges: An Updated Look At The Friday Before Labor Day

The Friday before Labor Day has long been a strong seasonal day for the market.  The study below is one I also showed last year.  The stats table based on buying the Thursday before Labor Day and selling the close on Friday.

With 71% of the days finishing higher, a profit factor of over 2.5, and an average trade of 0.3% the stats are quite compelling.  Regardless how it plays out today, I hope everyone has a great Labor Day weekend!
