# Timely Portfolio: What Do the Odds Say? Buy Stocks Begin of Year?

> 来源：[http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2014/01/what-do-odds-say-buy-stocks-begin-of.html#0001-01-01](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2014/01/what-do-odds-say-buy-stocks-begin-of.html#0001-01-01)

At some point in 2013, I read (can’t remember where) that 2012 was a rare year for the S&P 500  where no day’s closing  price was lower than the closing price  for the first day.  So if you bought on the first day of 2012, you never had a loss for the entire year.  Well, the same thing happened 2013, so I just had to do some analysis.  Below is a [dimple.js](http://dimplejs.org) chart built using [rCharts](http://rcharts.io/howitworks) with the minimum close price for the year divided by the close price for the first day of that year.
