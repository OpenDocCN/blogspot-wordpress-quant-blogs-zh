    immersion in the technical world of high-frequency trading (HFT). I collected some
    copies of [*Best Execution*](http://www.bestexecution.net) and because I am interested
    by the space-time issues of the market microstructure – for example: how orders
    are routed between the different lit exchanges/dark pools/crossing networks located
    in different places – I have found this [paper](http://www.bestexecution.net/viewpoint-darren-toulson-2/)
    quite absorbing.'

    the matching engine of  NYSE is not time synchronized with the BZX matching engine, the
    matching engine of EDGX is not time synchronized with the Nasdaq matching engine,
    and so on, and that is problematic: without synchronization – in the HFT world microseconds
    count – it’s impossible to exactly know how and when an order was filled (here
    or there), which kind of order type was used, etc. So both academics and investors don’t
    have precise data. Data is missing.'

    2013\. In short, the proposal was:'

    Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF, the French SEC) saying that they were working on
    the synchronization issues and they would have been happy to meet me in order
    to have my opinion on the topic. It was a little fun to see that a regulator was interested
    by my point of view, but I didn’t have a lot of things to say, even if I met the AMF
    people involved in these issues and told them to speak with Stéphane Tyč. They
    did and with the help of Stéphane they refined the proposition (about timestamps
    synchronization) they have sent to the European regulator ESMA. I was only a go-between,
    and I’m still a go-between here.

    of microwave networks used by some HFT players), he kindly asked me to read and
    comment a white paper he was working on about best execution, the time synchronization
    of exchanges, etc. I can’t define myself as a true specialist but I think what
    Stéphane Tyč proposes is a very interesting way to level the playing field. Here
    is the white paper:'
