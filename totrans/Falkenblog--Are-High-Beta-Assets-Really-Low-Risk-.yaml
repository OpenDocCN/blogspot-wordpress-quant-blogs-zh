    are low risk. He seems like a good guy, merely confused, so as a public service
    I''ll try to explain why this makes about as much sense as the qwerty keyboard.'

    betas in bull markets (good!) and lower betas in bear markets (also good!). In
    that sense, they are less risky than a simple high beta asset. True enough. A
    1.5 beta portfolio probably has less risk than the SPY levered 1.5 times due to
    this effect. But the higher beta portfolio is still considerable riskier than
    average by any definition.

    total sample, and the truncated sample when the S&P500 falls. I don't think the
    'long put' idea is really at work. Now, it is true that prospective betas are
    closer to 1.0 than measured historically, and this has been well-known for decades.

    and low beta stocks are underestimated. This is also accounted for in beta estimates
    that incorporate a bayesian prior, as is the default assumption for Bloomberg
    betas.

    would be a neat trick. I don't see any evidence for that.
