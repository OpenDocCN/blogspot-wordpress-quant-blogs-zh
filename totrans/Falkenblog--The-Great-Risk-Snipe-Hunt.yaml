    going to be useful for whatever theory is the correct theory. And, what we do
    … at least is generate good interesting mathematics that is useful for other things
    in physics, and I think if it’s not string theory, it will be probably something
    similar to it."'

    to be built out of the mathematical edifice already created, because the elegance
    and power of what has been created seems not just capable, but necessary to be
    any reasonable solution. The stochastic discount factor approach encapsulating
    CAPM is surely not a coincidence to these researchers.

    any other result in finance. The results are quite mixed and in many ways discouraging…At
    bottom…the central message of the CAPM is this: the prices of securities should
    be higher (or lower) to the extent their payoffs are slanted towards states in
    which aggregate wealth is low (or high)…The true pricing equation may not take
    the exact form of the CAPM, but the enduring belief of many financial economists
    is that, whatever form it takes, it will at least embody this principle.'

    clear. This is not a sign of a successful theory. Risk started out as merely nondiversifiable
    volatility, and now assets with really high nondiversifiable volatility presumably
    have low risk via some spooky risk factor, and behavioral biases are applied piecemeal
    to various anomalies (anchoring, preferring positive skew, or negative skew).
