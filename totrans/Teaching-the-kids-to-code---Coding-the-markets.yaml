- en: I‚Äôve had a couple of attempts at teaching our two sons to program. I‚Äôve tried
    [pygame](http://www.pygame.org/news.html) and [squeak](http://www.squeak.org/),
    but neither has triggered that obsessional, can‚Äôt prise fingers away from keyboard
    quality. Tonight I had another go, using [scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu) from
    [MIT](http://www.mit.edu). It‚Äôs a marvellous visual programming environment, with
    a very low barrier to entry. Both the lads were hooked instantly. Strongly recommended
    as a first dev env. I think I might try coding up some program trading algorithms
    in it üòâ
