    Rittenhouse of Catallactic Analysis. For the purposes of this series we will demonstrate
    a variety of simple learning algorithms that  function well and incorporate some
    of the concepts underlying our proprietary algorithm.  The technology is called
    “ARO” which stands for Adaptive, Robust, and Optimal. These are the qualities
    that were emphasized in creating the machine to make it stand apart from neural
    networks or conventional machine learning. In a sense, it was designed to straddle
    the line between being robust, yet optimal, and capable of functioning in new
    environments using an adaptive mechanism.

    one of the most important is that it is “bias free.” What I mean is that the algorithm
    should not have any preconceived trading  style such as a bias toward trend following
    or mean reversion. It should also consider all possible combinations of  a given
    strategy within reason. To be “bias free” the ” adaptive time machine” should
    be just as likely to go long or short given strategy under the right circumstances. In
    this example we will focus on a short term strategy algorithm to keep things simple,
    but our testing reveals that it is effective using intermediate and long-term
    strategies as well.

    days, which reduces bias in the machine so that it is not “discovering” daily
    follow through -a well-documented effect in the literature.   When you use runs
    over the last 5 trading days the best entry/exits change very frequently over
    time, forcing the learning algorithm to adapt to be able to survive new environments.
    The algorithm is able to go long or short after a series of “n” down or up runs
    and exit after a series of “m” up or down runs. Thus there are 50 possible different
    combinations of entries and exits. The algorithm  investigates all of the possible
    strategies and determines: 1) whether a strategy should be traded either long
    or short 2) whether a strategy is statistically significant from zero 3) whether
    a strategy beats buy and hold 4) the “optimal” strategy'
