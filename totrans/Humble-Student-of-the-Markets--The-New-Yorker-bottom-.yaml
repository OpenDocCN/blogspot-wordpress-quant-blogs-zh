    magazine (not financial one such as the Wall Street Journal, Barrons or the Financial
    Times) writes about either the devastation of bear markets or the beauty of stocks,
    then it's a contrarian sign marking either a top (in the case of exuberance) or
    bottom (in the case of excessive bearishness).

    a bottom, even if it's a short or intermediate term bottom?
