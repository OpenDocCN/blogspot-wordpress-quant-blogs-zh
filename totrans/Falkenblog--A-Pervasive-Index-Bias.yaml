    have a huge survivorship bias to them. Don't they all.

    the asset in question, which is more so the more illiquid the asset.

    indices they present. For example, Malkiel and Saha (2005) found that no hedge
    fund data base providers has the last year of Long Term Capital Management in
    their dataset, excluding the -92% return, and so the indexes exclude the very
    risks that make hedge fund investors nervous. Malkiel and Saha estimate this bias
    adds approximately 6% to the annualized returns. Who creates these indices? Usually
    groups that are allied with the product one is examining. For example, the Credit
    Suisse/Tremont Index that monitors hedge fund returns is maintained by the following:'

    expertise of Credit Suisse, one of the world's leading global investment banking
    firms, and the data research group of Tremont Capital Management, Inc., a full-service

    have access to the best data, will be advocates of this field—one does not become
    extensively knowledgeable in something one thinks is irrelevant, inefficient,
    or fraudulent. Often times there’s an arm’s length separation between the index
    provider and the portfolio managers, but there is no way they can be indifferent:
    without the market thriving, seeming to offer a good opportunity, their service
    will not have a long life. After all, it was conventional wisdom that active portfolio
    managers outperformed passive indices until the 1980’s—for several generations—because
    the evidence was generally held and presented by the active managers and their
    industry groups. It was based on the intuitive idea that someone managing a portfolio
    is obviously better than merely buying an indiscriminate, equal weighting of equities.
    So issues like using closing prices to calculate total returns, while in very
    liquid markets a benign assumption, in illiquid markets is a material error.'
