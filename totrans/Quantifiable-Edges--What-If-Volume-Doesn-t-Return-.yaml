    and volume will come back. But does volume always return after Labor Day? What

- en: The study above suggests negative consequences should Tuesday’s volume not surpass
    Friday’s. The sample size is quite small, though and there have been no occurrences
    since 1994\. Therefore I decided to widen the parameters. In this case I’m looking
    for instances where post Labor Day Tuesday volume doesn’t manage to exceed all
    of the days the previous week.

    return from vacation Tuesday. Otherwise, September could be a difficult month.
