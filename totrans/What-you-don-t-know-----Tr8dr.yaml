- en: Sometimes there are precipitous drops (or ascents) in price over a very short
    period in the market.   Over a short period,  momentum analysis from prices or
    order flow, is not going to allow one to avoid becoming a casualty — Unless, you
    have  up-front information or lower-latency access to the event source than most
    participants.

    flow and therefore can have a read on supply and demand for a given asset.

- en: banks also know who their trading-counterparts (customers) are and whether the
    customer is “smart”,  tending to trade ahead of movements.  They also have a good
    view on how much size is traded over what period.  This is valuable information
    that they can piggyback on.

- en: The small HF hedge fund participates on the anonymous venues without access
    to either of these.    Now a fund may have better models, but still lacks a direct
    view of the market flows as indicated above.    Whether it be large-flow houses
    or smart hedge funds, some smaller % of orders represent “smart” or in-the-know
    money and the larger % will tend to be more reactive.

- en: The bottom pane contains order-streams for a few bid-side orders of interest
    in this discussion.   **dp** is expressed in distance from the inside price (for
    the bid side this means a larger DP means a lower order price).   By order-streams,
    referring to implicit cancel/replace activity by a trader (algo).

- en: Notice that the orders have been moved deeper into the book (as seen by a spike
    in **dp**) as a defensive move against a falling price.  Looking more closely,
    this set of orders actually made the move **before** the drop (aha, “smart” algo
    working here).

    the book ~60ms before the drop and the other colors a ms or 2 before drop but
    in-time to avoid a fill.

- en: If you don’t have early access to information, look for a participant who does
    and use appropriately.   This is easier said than done, however. Detecting participants
    (i.e. order-streams) and determining whether they are “smart” or “dumb” is not
    straightforward.   I will touch on some of the related problems in a later post,
    but unfortunately cannot discuss everything in detail.
