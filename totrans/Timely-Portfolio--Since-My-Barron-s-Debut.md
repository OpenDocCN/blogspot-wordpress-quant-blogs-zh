# Timely Portfolio: Since My Barron’s Debut

> 来源：[http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2011/03/since-my-barrons-debut.html#0001-01-01](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2011/03/since-my-barrons-debut.html#0001-01-01)

Jack Willoughby in Barron’s November 1, 2010 summarized their [Big Money Poll in an article titled “Bears Beware.”](http://online.barrons.com/article/SB50001424053111903697804575574310818799270.html#articleTabs_panel_article%3D1)  Commenters on Twitter and blogs everywhere cited this as a perfect “Cover Story” indicator to exit the stock market.  This article was also my Barron’s debut

> "Bonds aren't the best place to make money," says Kenton Russell, a portfolio manager for Sterne Agee. "They are severely overvalued. The only way a bond investment works at current yields is if we're in a depression. Some ugly things [would] have to come true."
> 
> Russell recommends high-yielding, big-cap stocks issued by companies with strong balance sheets. The most bullish Big Money participant, he predicts the Dow will reach 14,000 by mid-2011, with the S&P rising to 1,300 and the Nasdaq to 2,500\. Investors have abandoned risk "precisely at the time they should be taking risks," he says.

I hope I am this right every time I appear in Barron’s as seen in the chart below

Unfortunately though, I think the move in stocks is almost done just as my targets are reached 5 months early, so I’m not sure it counts.  I would love to see the poll now.  My guess is it would be much different with many more aggressive bulls and with me as a bear.
