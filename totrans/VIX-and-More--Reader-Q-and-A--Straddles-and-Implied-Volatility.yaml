    to be profitable and I closed it after the IV spike on Thursday. I shouldn''t
    have come back for more, but I placed another ATM straddle Monday before the close
    and even with the huge drop in price on Tuesday the IV collapse only allowed me
    to break even. These were my first two super short term volatility trades and
    now I now that the free IV data on the CBOE''s website is an end of day service...
    definitely wouldn''t have placed that trade on Monday afternoon. Seeing now that
    I possibly should have been doing the opposite, shorting volatility, do you suggest
    any strategies that aren''t outright short and don''t require a big amount of
    margin to be put up? *'

    to go up and up. Should this happen, depending upon your cash cushion, eventually
    your broker will hit you with a margin call and you will be forced to cover at
    a significant loss.

- en: Take the same basic trade and add a second leg as a hedge and your unlimited
    risk is now limited. Instead of a naked short, a bear call spread involving 10
    short SLV July 47 calls plus 10 long SLV July 50 calls caps your loss at the distance
    between the two strikes. Here that is 50-47 or three points. Three points times
    10 options (with a 100 multiplier) puts your maximum loss at $3000.

    about $1.20 for that spread, so that means your maximum profit is $1200 and maximum
    loss is $3000 - $1200 or $1800.

    is they are converting an unlimited risk strangle or straddle into a limited risk
    condor or butterfly by buying out-of-the-money legs to hedge their risk, just
    as was the case with the call spread example above. As a matter of fact, one way
