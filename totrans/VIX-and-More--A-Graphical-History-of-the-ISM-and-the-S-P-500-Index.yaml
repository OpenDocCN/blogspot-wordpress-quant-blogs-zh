    Management ([ISM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/ISM)) index of 36.2
    is in the historical context and just what it may mean for the stock market.

    identifies the six previous instances since 1950 in which the ISM index dipped
    as low as the current level.

    periods. What I find particularly interesting is that, consistent with the belief
    that stocks are a leading indicator, when the ISM bottomed, this was often after
    stocks had made a substantial move off of their eventual bottom.
