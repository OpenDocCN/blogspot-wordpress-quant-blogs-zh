- en: Although I haven't been all that much of a fan of moving average based methods,
    I've observed some discussions and made some attempts to determine if it's possible
    to get an actual smoothed filter with a causal model. Anyone who's worked on financial
    time series filters knows that the bane of filtering is getting a smooth response
    with very low delay. Ironically, one would think that you need a very small moving
    average length to accomplish a causal filter with decent lag properties; often
    a sacrifice is made between choosing a large parameter to obtain decent smoothing
    at the cost of lag.

    1 year worth of data. It is completely causal and described by .. gasp.. 250 coefficients.

    possible that the model may not fare as well; it remains to be investigated. However,
    thought I would share this work to give some ideas about potential of causal filtering
    methods.
