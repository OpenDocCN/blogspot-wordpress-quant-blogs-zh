- en: The traders in New York would accumulate a block of shares, driving the price
    up, and then get brokers like Blaine to unload the shares quickly at the higher
    price—whereupon the price would, often as not, fall. "Seven months in at Lehman,
    I was one of the top rookie producers," Blaine says, "but every stock I bought
    went down."

    genius lies more in running businesses than in picking stocks. But in the investing
    world, that is ignored. Wall Street, with its army of brokers, analysts, and advisers
    funneling trillions of dollars into mutual funds, hedge funds, and private equity
    funds, is an elaborate fraud. [italics my own]

    Of the 6,000 A.G. Edwards brokers, he still ranked in the top 30\. But for every
    dollar that passed through his hands, he was slicing off a surprisingly small
    piece for himself and A.G. Edwards. This brought a letter from the head of sales,
    saying that while managers appreciated how much revenue he generated, they wanted
    to see him generate 10 percent more. They want me to churn these accounts, he
    thought. He fired off an angry reply and refused to trade. A few months later,
    he received a visit from a local manager. It makes the Securities and Exchange
    Commission unhappy, the manager said, to see brokers getting paid for doing nothing.
    The U.S. government wanted Blaine to churn his accounts. “At that point,” he says,
    "I was done."

    selections later underperformed the market by 6.7 percent. In 1997, SmartMoney
    found seven new best mutual fund managers. They finished 3.4 percent below the
    market. In 1998, the magazine’s newest best funds came in 2.2 percent below the
    market. Soon after, Wellington says, "*SmartMoney* stopped its annual survey of
    the best mutual fund managers."'
