- en: With the market stuck in a downtrend many participants are saying “Help me Obi
    Ben Bernanke. You’re my only hope.” Bear Stearns managed to wipe away any chance
    of a pre-Fed meeting rally. Rallies leading up to Fed meetings are fairly common
    as investors hope for good news. Selloffs prior to meetings are not common.

- en: Over the last two days the S&P 500 has dropped over 2.75%. I looked back to
    1982 to find other times where the market has dropped at least 2.75% in the two
    days leading up to a Fed meeting. I found six other occurrences. They were 11/16/82,
    7/8/86, 3/30/87, 8/19/91, 1/29/02 and 5/6/02\. In 5 of 6 cases the market rallied
    on the day of the meeting. The Fed generally managed not to make things worse.
    The average gain the day of the Fed meeting was 1.0%. The lone loss was only 0.3%.
    Looking out 2 days all six were positive and the average gain was 2.3%.

    rallies have a tendency to be short-lived. Again looking back to 1982 I looked
    at buying at the close of any day there was a Fed meeting and the market finished
    up 1% or more. As you can see by the table below, after two days there is a negative
    expected value. Going out two weeks it generally gets progressively worse.

- en: The market is oversold on a price basis. The VIX is spiking. The Put/Call ratios
    continue to put up overly bearish readings, and the Fed is meeting tomorrow. All
    these things suggest a bounce. Unfortunately, the last two days look rather ordinary
    on a chart. There was no washout or accelerated move lower. This calls into doubt
    the possibility that today could serve as a bottom should the Fed along with the
    positives mentioned above spark a rally over the next day or two. Right now a
    reasonable roadmap to keep in mind might be a short, oversold bounce followed
    by another leg lower. I’ll continue to re-evaluate as the next few days unfold,
    though.

    to the picture posted above, gold closing over $1,000/oz today meant I simply
    couldn’t afford it.
