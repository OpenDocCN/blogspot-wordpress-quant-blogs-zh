- en: The stock market began 2023 with a rally based on the "green shoots" narrative
    of a Fed pivot and optimism about the effects of China reopening its economy.
    Since then, the S&P 500 rose to test resistance as defined by its falling trend
    line and pulled back. Similarly, the equal-weighted S&P 500, the mid-cap S&P 400,
    and the small-cap Russell 2000 all tested and failed at overhead resistance.
