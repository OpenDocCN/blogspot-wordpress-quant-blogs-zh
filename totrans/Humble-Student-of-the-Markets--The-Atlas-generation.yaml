    down capital accumulation, productivity growth and long-term potential growth***.
    Although we do not provide direct evidence of this, a recent study suggests that
    there may be non-linear effects of public debt on growth, with adverse output
    effects tending to rise as the debt/GDP ratio approaches the 100% limit (Reinhart
    and Rogoff (2009b)).'

    the age of 20 today. In economies that experience reasonable rates of growth,
    young people enter the work force in their 20s, acquire experience and go on to
    progress further in their chosen field.

    are less likely to get on the first rung of the ladder in order to learn their
    craft. If they don’t get on the first rung, then the opportunity to progress further
    in their careers would be further limited. Could we see a generation of 30-somethings

    we make the mistakes of our grandparents." Our parents typically warn us of the
    problems they survived, but not those that their parents did. Thus we fall into
    the forgotten problem, and why big busts tend to recur about once every two generations.

    be plenty of opportunities in selected industries in the coming decades. I believe
    that we will see exciting breakthroughs in life extension research and nanotechnology,
    just to name a couple, in the coming decade. Nevertheless, the operative word
    is “selective”.

    an undergraduate degree in Computer Science in 1980, the height of the “inflation”
    boom decade of the 1970’s. Computer Science grads were hot back then. Everyone
    in my graduating class who wanted a job got a job. Most got multiple offers. Two
    years later in 1982, at the height of the recession, about 2/3 of the class found
    jobs and some people had great difficulty. Some years later, a friend and I informally
    compared the career progression of the class of 1980 (my year) with the class
    of 1982\. The class of 1982 appeared to be hobbled in their careers compared to
    the 1980 graduates and never really recovered from their poor start. Were we smarter
    than them? Or better than them?

    fight harder for fewer rewards than we did. Some will return as adults to live
    in their parents’ and grandparents’ basements despite their innate talent, ingenuity
    and efforts.
