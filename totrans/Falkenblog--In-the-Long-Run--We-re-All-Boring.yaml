    inhabitants are presumed to be much smarter; in one guy''s opinion, like the difference
    between us and a nematode. A theme of these essays is boredom. Consider a 1000
    IQ person who knows all of history, mathematics, etc. Would you imagine this guy
    to be full of pep, enthusiasm? optimism? Bertrand Russell, whose youthful love
    of mathematics helped him overcome a bout of suicidal despair, later came to believe
    that mathematics is fundamentally ''trivial''. So what''s a super-intelligent
    being going to find interesting when he gets old? Our biggest challenge is not
    the extinction of the sun, or asteroids, but catastrophic boredom.'

- en: I think this exercise highlights that intelligence will not become as great
    as these futurists suspect. Even today, the super intelligent reproduce at lower
    rates than the less intelligent, and this makes sense. For a stupid person, having
    a baby is like buying a puppy. For a smart person, having a baby is a huge trade-off,
    not only because smart people understand the huge responsibility they have created,
    but because very few great trains of thought can withstand the incessant interruptions
    of children.

- en: It's hard to imagine moderate usage of anything in the long run (i.e. 1MM years).
    Indeed, I think if heaven and hell are infinite, then it really doesn't matter
    where you go, because even with 72 virgins, after several million years, they
    won't be virgins, and I'll be really sick of all those annoying harps (angels
    always play harps). Meanwhile, in bowels of hell, the first few days of being
    lowered upside-down into a vat of boiling human excrement, then raped by insatiable,
    barbed-penis-wielding hellhounds, will be terrifying. But by year 1MM it would
    be merely monotonous.

  zh: 长期来看（即100万年），很难想象对任何事物的适度使用。事实上，我认为，如果天堂和地狱是无限的，那么你去哪里都无关紧要，因为即使有72个处女，几百万年后，她们也不再是处女了，而我也会对所有那些令人讨厌的竖琴感到厌倦（天使总是弹竖琴）。与此同时，在地狱的深处，头几天被倒挂入一大桶沸腾的人类排泄物，然后被永不满足、用刺刀似的阴茎奸淫的地狱猎犬强奸将是可怕的。但到了100万年，它只是单调乏味了。
- en: Very high intelligence is great for solving problems, but really bad for enjoying
    things. If you were super intelligent, you might be able to speak every language,
    solve every math problem, but then, you would not appreciate sports, sex, jokes,
    and conversation (Richard Posner noted that he likes tv because most casual conversation
    is actually quite banal). I don't think you can avoid the trade-off, which is
    why I would much rather have a son with an IQ of 120 than a son with an IQ of
    160, I think the former would be happier.

- en: So I think self-aware subsystems, i.e. conscious agents, have a limit to their
    intelligence, in that they will choose to not procreate because for them it isn't
    enjoyable. Thus, the only intelligence that will increase in the future will be
    emergent intelligence, things like bee hives, or ant mounds, that act like an
    organism but are full of ignorant agents. Agents themselves, who have total control,
    will opt out. Only systems that really have no control, or objective, will grow
    in intelligence as seen by the outside (for example, our cellular machinery is
    very smart, and contains an amazing amount of 'intelligence', but it is not conscious).
    But we humans, I suspect, are pretty close to as smart as conscious agents will
    get.

  zh: 所以我认为自我意识的子系统，即意识者，他们的智力是有极限的，因为他们会选择不繁衍，因为对他们来说这是不愉快的。因此，未来唯一会增长的智慧将是新兴智慧，类似蜂巢或蚁丘的东西，它们像有机体一样行事，但充满了无知的个体。拥有完全控制权的个体会选择退出。唯一真正没有控制或目标的系统，将会像外界看到的那样增长智慧（比如，我们的细胞机制非常聪明，并包含惊人数量的“智慧”，但它并不是有意识的）。但我们人类，我怀疑，已经非常接近意识者的智慧极限了。
