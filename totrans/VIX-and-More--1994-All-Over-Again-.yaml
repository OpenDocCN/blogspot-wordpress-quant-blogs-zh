    Kass at TSCM has an article, [Bears Locate a Template for a Crash](http://www.thestreet.com/_tscana/markets/activetraderupdate/10334755.html),
    devoted to the many similarities between early 2007 and early 1994.

- en: '"A two-month drop of nearly 10% in the S&P 500 Index began at the end of January
    1994\. The emerging markets collapsed -- Hong Kong''s market fell by a third and
    Mexico by an even greater amount. The bond market got schmeissed -- by year-end,
    the 10-year U.S. note had fallen 20 points, correcting the entire gain of the
    previous three years. Finally, the VIX fell back to 1990 levels, climbing from
    9 to 24 in only two months..."'

    sharp shock, but it should be enough to make the bulls a little more skittish
    for awhile.
