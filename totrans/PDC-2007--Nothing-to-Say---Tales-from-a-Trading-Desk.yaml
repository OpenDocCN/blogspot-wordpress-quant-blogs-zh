    Maybe [MIX](http://www.microsoft.com/events/mix/default.mspx) is the new PDC üôÇ¬†
    Generally agree with Scoble regards the last few PDC‚Äôs, you just have to look
    at what happened with [WinFS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WinFS)¬†and Vista.¬†
    I‚Äôm surprised that Microsoft has nothing to talked about regards .NET Framework
    4.0, given that Orcas is in beta 1\. The thought of [OSX](http://www.apple.com/macosx/)
    driving the Windows architecture is somewhat amusing.¬† Maybe Microsoft should
    just announce Visual Studio for OSX üòâ and drop Windows Vista completely.
