    extremely hard to make document creation easier by becoming even more streamlined
    and cooperative ([New Version of RStudio (v0.96)](http://blog.rstudio.org/2012/05/14/rstudio-v096/)). 
    Thanks so much for these extremely helpful and generous contributors.

    applies in most situations in the money management world.  This also fits for
    performance reporting and marketing, except the transaction history section would
    either be eliminated or replaced by a section highlighting trades or ideas that
    have been used in the past.

    just could not wait.  I started working on the Return section.  Please let me
    know what you think as your comments will guide the rest of the report.  If you
    are viewing in a RSS reader, you might need to [view through this link](https://www.box.com/s/25e3227a39064a973206),
