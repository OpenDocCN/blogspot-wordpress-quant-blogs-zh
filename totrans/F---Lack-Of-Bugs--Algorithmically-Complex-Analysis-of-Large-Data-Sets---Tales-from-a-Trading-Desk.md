## F#: Lack Of Bugs, Algorithmically Complex Analysis of Large Data Sets

Unfortunately I missed Don’s recent talk at the London [F#](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/ru-ru/bec977b8-c9d9-4926-999e-e50c4498df8a) User Group, but at least the slides and video is availabile [here](http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/open-source-dot-net/don-syme-on-f). Slides 28 and 29 provide some interesting insight into F# usage within companies.

Slide 79 is yet again another financial bias example 🙂 which does lead to the issue of a need for improved integration between F# and StreamInsight – last time I tired both together it was “painful”.
