    in danger of garnering honorary VIX pundit status, due to his tendency to talk
    about the VIX almost as much as [Adam Warner](http://adamsoptions.blogspot.com/)
    and I do.  Today, Schaeffer [discusses](http://www.schaeffersresearch.com/plus/bgscommentary.aspx?click=home&ID=18383)
    the monthly VIX cycle and ties it in with the recent low VIX readings as follows:'

    up put options when trading starts today in an effort to lock in some ‘cheap’
    protection. This would put downside pressure on the market.*'

- en: '*As we have seen in the past, while expiration week tends to be strong for
    the market, the week following option expiration is often marred by a pullback
    in the major indices. Frequently, traders will jump back into put positions now
    that their previous positions have expired. This swelling in bearish bets is accompanied
    by hedging among the traders who take the other side of that trade and sell the
    puts, another factor that creates downside pressure.*'

    have been in the first half of the month, with the very notable exception of May
    2006 and also November 2006 (July 2006 is on the bubble).*'

- en: '*Another way of framing this could be that in the post-expiration period each
    month (always in the second half), market performance is ‘challenged’ by the fact
    low VIX periods attract put buyers and stock sellers. A better explanation might
    be that the rise in the VIX from the second half of a typical month into a peak
    in the first half of the next month is the result of the accumulation of index
    puts in the new front month, with the VIX peaking (and selling pressure lifting)
    once all the put demand is satisfied.”*'

    on VIX price movements during the options expiration cycle, which was also supported
    by an [examination](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/02/vix-and-quarterly-cycle.html)
    of VIX prices during the quarterly earnings cycle.

    a vicious circle for the VIX?  If so, what happens when portfolio insurance gets
    more expensive and this circle is broken?
