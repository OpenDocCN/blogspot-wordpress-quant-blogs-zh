# Humble Student of the Markets: Trump vs. the Fed

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2019/06/trump-vs-fed.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2019/06/trump-vs-fed.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models**

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post,

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The

**Trend Model**

is an asset allocation model which applies trend following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or contraction (bearish)?"

My inner trader uses a

**trading model**

, which is a blend of price momentum (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa). Subscribers receive real-time alerts of model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of the those email alerts are updated weekly

. The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that began in March 2016 is shown below.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Buy equities*
*   Trend Model signal: Neutral*
*   Trading model: Bullish*

**Tariff Man and Dow Man gang up on the Fed**

David Rosenberg advanced an intriguing theory last week. Could Trump be weakening the economy sufficiently for the Fed to cut rates, and then call off the trade war so that the stock market could soar ahead of the 2020 election?

Viewed in the context of

[Jerome Powell's remarks](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20190604a.htm)

at a Fed policy conference last week which acknowledged trade tension risks, that scenario is a possibility.

> I’d like first to say a word about recent developments involving trade negotiations and other matters. We do not know how or when these issues will be resolved. We are closely monitoring the implications of these developments for the U.S. economic outlook and, as always, we will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent objective. My comments today, like this conference, will focus on longer-run issues that will remain even as the issues of the moment evolve.

Will the Fed play ball? The market is now discounting three rate cuts by year-end, with the first one at the July FOMC meeting. This matters to equity investors. A historical study from Barclays showed that the stock market tends to have a strong positive reaction a month after the first rate cut, and returns were even stronger after six months.
