    room until regulators appear, then magically they are praised to high heaven.
    Often this includes obtusely patronizing remarks about how smart they are by senior
    management in the face of these outsiders, as if, hiring some cast-offs from Los
    Alamos clearly means there are no problems here! You can''t fool people who know

    very difficult to validate, the power of any test to validate is beyond your average
    risk manager's business life in his current occupation. Thus, as quantitative

    the big risks presented by crises happen so infrequently.

- en: 'This invites a lot of posturing. Many top risk managers are ex-regulators,

    those directly affecting revenue, the business line managers, accurately amortize

- en: Of course, at the top, these executive's success is less dependent on actual
    success, because these people are managing people who manage businesses, and so,
    like Robert Rubin, you can make $100MM without actually knowing he had a lot of
    mortgage paper on his balance sheet (details!). That's an independent issue, why
    the managers of managers get paid so much (I'm think there's room for improvement
    here). For the business line, the guy actually creating the business, at least
    3 layers below the CEO, his risk management is essential.

- en: In contrast, the full time risk manager is a dilettante. He does cursory reviews
    of perhaps 20+ different business lines and so is clueless to the real issues,
    because anyone spending 1/20th the time on something you do that actually has
    alpha, and delivers profits (ie,is actually valuable, and so not obvious), cannot
    be understood with such minimal focus. Yet, he's the guy you show to regulators,
    or investors, when talking about risk management. Reality is very decentralized,
    and its a convenient fiction to think that risk can be centralized and managed
    by the Board, or someone not working in the business day in and day out. Clearly
    this problem is only worsened if we think about delegating risk management to
    regulators, who are even further removed.

  zh: 相比之下，全职风险管理人员是个业余爱好者。他对可能有20多个不同业务线进行粗略审查，因此对真正的问题一无所知，因为任何花费你1/20的时间在实际带来收益（即，实际有价值的东西）的事情上的人，是不能用这么少的关注来理解的。然而，当谈到风险管理时，他却是向监管机构或投资者展示的人。现实是非常分散的，以及认为风险可以被董事会或不是日复一日在业务中工作的人集中管理是一个方便的虚构。显然，如果我们考虑将风险管理委托给监管机构，这个问题只会更糟。
- en: I think it's a fiction to think one can meaningfully present the risk of any
    collective via a concise table of numbers. A senior executive should emphasize
    they prioritize the validation of expected loss forecasts within each business
    line (at KeyCorp, we had 130 lines of business, and many of these were composites),
    by obligor (counterparty) rating and collateral (eg, secured by property, or unsecured?).
    They should note new activities have extra layers of cushion applied to these
    expected loss estimates. They should then present a set of examples of how risk
    is broken down in a particular business line (say, indirect auto lending), including
    actual and expected loss rates by as much granularity as possible (crosstabbing
    by 5 risk grades, 3 collateral types). They should also highlight any changes
    to the methodology, because innovation involves change, and data will not be available;
    that is understandable. The changes should be based on some kind of theory or
    analogue, or story. This helps the outsider understand why they are doing this,
    and how it can be validate (ie, why shouldn't people make a down payment? Because
    house prices always rise!).

  zh: 我认为，通过简明扼要的数字表格有意义地呈现任何集体的风险是虚构的。高级执行人员应强调他们优先考虑验证每个业务线的预期损失预测（在KeyCorp，我们有130个业务线，其中许多是复合的），根据义务人（交易对手）评级和抵押品（例如，房产抵押或无抵押）。他们应该指出新活动对这些预期损失估计额外的层次。然后，他们应呈现一系列关于如何在特定业务线中分解风险的例子（比如，间接汽车贷款），包括尽可能多的实际和预期损失率的细分（通过5个风险等级、3种抵押品类型的交叉表）。他们还应该强调任何方法论的变化，因为创新涉及改变，而且数据将不可用；这是可以理解的。变化应该基于某种理论或类比，或故事。这有助于外部人员理解他们为什么这样做，以及如何验证（即，为什么人们不应该首付？因为房价总是在上涨！）。
- en: They should then invite the analyst to ask for another example, based on the
    business or product of their choosing, which would imply each line was ready to
    present their risk. The request would then entail someone from, say, Media Lending,
    to come up, and explain how they slice up risk, how they validate their loss forecasts
    by the granularity they present (including lines, loans, and letters of credit),
    and how pricing, revenue sharing with cash management, and costs of funds, relate
    (this can highlight conflicts of interest). The presentation should be amenable
    to a 30 minute presentation; if that is not possible, then clearly they do not
    have it under control. By letting the outsider choose, they can be confident their
    questions would be answered similarly if they did this on another business line.

  zh: 接着，他们应邀请分析师要求另一个例子，基于他们选择的业务或产品，这将意味着每一行都准备好展示他们的风险。请求将涉及从媒体贷款等部门的人出来，解释他们如何划分风险，如何通过他们提供的细分（包括线路、贷款和信用证）来验证他们的损失预测，以及定价、收入分享与资金成本之间的关系（这可能会凸显利益冲突）。演示应该适合30分钟的展示；如果这不可能，那么显然他们无法控制。通过让外部人员选择，他们可以确信如果他们在另一个业务线上这样做，他们的问题将会得到类似的回答。
- en: They should note that no one gets a bonus for revenue generated the prior year,

- en: 'Risk in any diverse financial organization cannot be summed up by a third party
    into a scalar. The essence of risk is like the essence of productivity: the parochial
    knowledge, processes, and incentives of very diverse activities. This is necessarily
    a detail oriented issue, and the big risks are bad assumptions, not bad math.
    That is, it was not copulas, or correlations, that screwed up subprime, but the
    assumption housing prices, in aggregate, would not fall. That''s a bad assumption,
    based on understandable but flawed logic. You cannot appreciate these bad assumptions
    merely by adding up all their flawed implications and comparing them to total
    bank capital.'

  zh: 任何多元化的金融机构的风险都不能被第三方简单地汇总为一个标量。风险的本质就像生产率的本质：非常多样化的活动的地方知识、流程和激励机制。这必然是一个注重细节的问题，而大风险不是坏数学，而是错误的假设。也就是说，不是copulas或相关性搞砸了次级市场，而是假设房价总体上不会下降。这是一个错误的假设，基于可以理解但有缺陷的逻辑。您不能仅通过将所有错误的影响相加并将其与总银行资本进行比较来欣赏这些错误的假设。
