    Below is a study that examines weak closes since the March bottom.

- en: I consider this particular study to be environmental. It is indicative of the
    strength of the rally of the last 7 months and not necessarily an all-weather
    setup. While I wouldn’t base a trade on this study I do think it will be important
    to see how it plays out over the next few days. An all out failure to bounce could
    suggest a change of character for the market.
