# Humble Student of the Markets: Correction is over, wait for the blow-off top

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2017/09/correction-is-over-wait-for-blow-off-top.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2017/09/correction-is-over-wait-for-blow-off-top.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models**

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post,

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The

**Trend Model**

is an asset allocation model which applies trend following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or contraction (bearish)?"

My inner trader uses the

**trading component**

of the Trend Model to look for changes in the direction of the main Trend Model signal. A bullish Trend Model signal that gets less bullish is a trading "sell" signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading "buy" signal. The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. Past trading of the trading model has shown turnover rates of about 200% per month.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Buy equities*
*   Trend Model signal: Neutral*
*   Trading model: Bearish*

** The performance chart and model readings have been delayed by a week out of respect to our paying subscribers.* **Update schedule**

: I generally update model readings on my

on weekends and tweet mid-week observations at @humblestudent. Subscribers will also receive email notices of any changes in my trading portfolio.

**The bull and bear cases**

In my last post (see

[A step-wise market advance](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2017/09/06/a-stepwise-market-advance/)

), I indicated that some of the concerns that overhang the stock market have been alleviated. Falling risk levels should act to put a floor on stock prices. Does that mean that stock prices are ready to rocket to new highs?

This week, I analyze both the near-term bull and bear cases for stocks. The bull case is based mainly on broad based fundamental momentum, such as continued improvements in ISM.

The bear case, on the other hand, is based on a case of bad breadth.
