- en: As shown by the chart below, the relative performance of the energy sector against
    the market has been topping out for the last few years (blue line), though bulls
    can be console by the fact that the long-term relative uptrend that began in 1999
    remains intact. From a technical perspective, there is a decent chance that the
    relative decline could be halted at the 50% Fibonacci retracement level, which
    roughly coincides with the long relative uptrend that began in 1999.
