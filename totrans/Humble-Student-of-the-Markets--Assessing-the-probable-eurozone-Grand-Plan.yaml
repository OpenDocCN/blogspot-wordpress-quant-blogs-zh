    other peripheral countries in order to put them on sustainable path to growth.
    At the same time, we will undertake steps to ring-fence the financial problems

    member states. With that in mind, we will implement the following five point plan.*'

    their own banks. Not all of the banks will be able to get new equity through the
    private market solution. If they go the full or partial nationalization route
