    I have elected to compare the aftermath of volatility spikes in 1987 and 2008\.
    For the [1987](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/1987) series, which
    begins with Black Monday, I have chosen to use a reconstruction of the ‘original
    VIX’ which has been tracked under the [VXO](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXO)
    ticker since 2003 and peaked at approximately 172; for 2008 I begin on November
    20^(th), which the close of 80.86 is the highest VIX close ever.

    high, post-spike volatility fell faster in 1987-88 than it did in 2008-09\. This
    is not surprising in that the consensus of opinion is that there was much less
    [structural volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/structural%20volatility)
    and a much shorter period of extreme risk during 1987-1988 than in 2008-09\. Interestingly
    enough, however, now that we are eight months and 169 trading days removed the
    November 20^(th) [VIX spike](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20spikes),
    it turns out that volatility has fallen to much lower levels in the current environment
    than in the eight months following the 1987-88 volatility spike.

    than 1987-88 throughout the 50, 100 and 150 day milestone. In the last month,
    however, the absolute level of volatility for 2009 has been consistently lower
    than the readings from 21 years ago. Whether there is indeed less risk in 2009
    than 1988 or whether the current period is simply characterized by higher levels
    of complacency remains to be seen.

    note that the VIX closed at 23.09 on Friday and the VXO closed at 23.06\. Using
    VXO data for 2008-2009 would result in the same takeaways and only slightly different
    data.
