    something. This, to me, is not correct. But you could start by rescinding the
    current government programs to encourage home ownership by allowing 3% down with
    bad credit. On Bloggingheads, Jane Hamsher blames the current crisis on the absence
    of regulation on swaps, which I find absurd (the real cause is the unprecedented
    losses on the collateral, not the derivatives based on that collateral). Stiglitz
    simply wants 'more regulation', and also blames Basel II (as if Basel I would
    have changed anything, he just hates the word 'market' in any regulation). The
    SEC is blaming short sellers. Lots of politicians are aiming solutions at the
    home owners, who bought houses they can't afford, and have nothing to lose (it's
    the lender's loss). Some blame hubris, or 'taking risks they don't understand',
    but without the benefit of hindsight, this is rather unhelpful, because no one
    intends to act with hubris, or take risks they don't understand.

    are wiping out equity owners, something not done previously.
