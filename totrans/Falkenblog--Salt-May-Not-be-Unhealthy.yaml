    diets. He argues carbohydrates put us on an insulin treadmill, whereas proteins
    and fats satiate us. It seems the key effect is on your appetite via insulin regulation
    and the stability of going into fat burning mode, as opposed to some calories
    having different effects on your weight.

    equaling causation. Indeed, there are a lot of bad correlations purported to be
    causations in medicine and biology, and it makes me skeptical of statins. Anyway,
    here's good news for salt lovers from a New York Times

- en: A new study found that low-salt diets increase the risk of death from heart
    attacks and strokes and do not prevent high blood pressure, but the research’s
    limitations mean the debate over the effects of salt in the diet is far from over.
    In fact, officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention felt so strongly
    that the study was flawed that they criticized it in an interview, something they
    normally do not do.

    were to die of heart disease – 50 people in the lowest third of salt consumption
    (2.5 grams of sodium per day) died during the study as compared with 24 in the
    medium group (3.9 grams of sodium per day) and 10 in the highest salt consumption
    group (6.0 grams of sodium per day). And while those eating the most salt had,
    on average, a slight increase in systolic blood pressure — a 1.71-millimeter increase
    in pressure for each 2.5-gram increase in sodium per day — they were no more likely
    to develop hypertension.
