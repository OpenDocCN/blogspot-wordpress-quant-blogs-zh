    but worth a read never the less.  The paper was picked up in more recent years
    by [Hacker](https://www.hackerschool.com/blog/51-paper-of-the-week-out-of-the-tar-pit)
    School, and also “10 Technical [Papers](http://blog.fogus.me/2011/09/08/10-technical-papers-every-programmer-should-read-at-least-twice/)
    Every Programmer Should Read (At Least Twice), and more recently, Brian [Gesiak](http://modocache.svbtle.com/thoughts-on-out-of-the-tar-pit).
