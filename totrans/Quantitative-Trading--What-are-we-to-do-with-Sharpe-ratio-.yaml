- en: 'Mike Burry started buying credit default swaps in 2005, essentially an insurance
    policy on mortgage-backed securities, betting that there will be widespread defaults
    on mortgages. Of course, we now know how this story would turn out: Mike Burry
    made $750 million in 2007 alone.  But there was nothing but pain for the fund
    manager and his investors in 2005-2006, since they had to pay an annual premium
    of 8% of the portfolio.  Investors who measured the performance of this strategy
    using Sharpe ratio, without knowing the details of the strategy itself, would
    be quite justified to think that it was an utter disaster prior to 2007\. And
    indeed, many of them lost no time in trying to pull out their investments.'

- en: So what are we to do with Sharpe ratio, with its inherent reliance on Gaussian
    distributions? Clearly, it is useful for measuring high frequency strategies which
    you can count on to generate consistent returns every day, but which has limited
    catastrophic risks. But it is less useful for measuring statistical arbitrage
    strategies that hold positions over multiple days, since there may well be substantial
    hidden catastrophic risks in these strategies that would not be revealed by their
    track record and standard deviation of returns alone. As for strategies that are
    designed to benefit from catastrophes, such as Mike Burry's CDS purchases or Nassim
    Taleb's options purchases, it is completely useless. If I were to allocate my
    assets over different hedge funds, I would be sure to include some funds in the
    first category to generate cash flows for my daily needs, as well as funds in
    the last category to benefit from the infrequent black-swan events. As for the
    funds in the middle category, I am increasingly losing my enthusiasm.
