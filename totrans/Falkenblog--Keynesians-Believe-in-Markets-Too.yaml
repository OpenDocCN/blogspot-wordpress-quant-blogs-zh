    US proves his standard Keynesian diagnosis is correct.

    — declared that we had entered a classic liquidity trap ... even large government
    borrowing won’t drive up interest rates, and you can print as much money as you
    like without causing inflation...[non-Keynesians] declared that soaring inflation
    was just around the corner, and that interest rates would spike...

    this, the real interest rate on 10-year bonds is actually negative.

    You can go a long time with negative profits if people are willing to give you
    credit. Yet as any small business lender knows, the only thing that stops these
    institutions is a lack of cash. Currently, US debt is so liquid, and has such
    a strong history, it remains a top credit. Yet it's good to remember that when
    I was in charge of economic risk capital allocations back in the 1990s for bank,
    mortgages had the lowest economic risk rating for any non-sovereign debt. Now
    it is on par with credit cards (ie, the worst credits).
