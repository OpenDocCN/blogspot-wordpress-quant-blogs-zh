    2nd chart provides longer historical context] uses 60 minute bars over the past
    two months to demonstrate that in spite of the recent bounce, today’s action sets
    up another bullish contrarian buy signal – at least in the NDX. This signal looks
    stronger if you consider the possibility of some support in the 1780 area. Take
    this with a grain of salt, but consider that the TRINQ’s track record has been
    very strong as of late.'

    in the current environment of uncertainty – and perhaps to sell premium just beyond
    important support and resistance levels.
