    11 Command Module code (Comanche054) and Lunar Module code (Luminary099)

- en: The .NET Compiler Platform (“Roslyn”) exposes a set of Compiler APIs and Workspaces
    APIs that provides rich information about your source code and that has full fidelity
    with the C# and Visual Basic languages. The transition to compilers as a platform
    dramatically lowers the barrier to entry for creating code focused tools and applications.
    It creates many opportunities for innovation in areas such as meta-programming,
    code generation and transformation, interactive use of the C# and VB languages,
    and embedding of C# and VB in domain specific languages.
