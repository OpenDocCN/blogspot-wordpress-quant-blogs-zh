    on code ownership, “Experience Report: Weak Code Ownership”.  “Too many cooks
    in the kitchen” is unfortunately a problem I suspect we have all seen to many
    times on medium to large projects.  Stating the obvious, encourage consistency
    on a large code base over n years is difficult – its unfortunate that stakeholders
    who haven’t come from a software engineering background don’t really grasp the
    issues of such problems.'

- en: Primary Code Ownership approach sounds interesting, and reminds me of similar
    approaches from n years ago on projects which entailed a small team on the server
    and client portion of a project, with a primary owner for each team.   Clearly
    splitting a project into microservices style can only aid the project by avoiding
    a single individual attempting to set and govern code ownership of a large code
    base.

    and the killing of code [reviews](http://eatcodeplay.com/why-we-killed-off-code-reviews/). 
    I think all to often code reviews are over hyped as a silver bullet solution.

    of branches and pull requests. It’s not just the act of checking out a branch,
    writing a great pull request or the 200 LOC/hour for the reviewer.
