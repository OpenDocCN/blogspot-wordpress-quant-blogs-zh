    to solve ‚Äì think of it as the ROI. ¬†Like the constant refactoring of code that
    never makes it to production, hours/days/weeks can be spent on data frame construction,
    modelling, tuning, refinement. ¬†However, at some points you need to step back
    from the cycle of modelling, revisit the problem, and validate that problem you
    perceived you were looking at, is still the right problem, and your solution is
    moving you towards a conclusion.

    Kanban üôÇ ¬†The business can now see value add (ROI), and decide on next steps.
    ¬†Thus avoiding the questions like ‚ÄúWhat are those data scientists actually doing?‚Äù
