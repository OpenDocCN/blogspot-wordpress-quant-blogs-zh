    I attempted to provide a brief overview of [historical volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/historical%20volatility)
    (HV) and put it in a broader volatility context.

    below uses closing data for the SPX for the last eleven trading sessions. The
    second row has a date of 11/24/09 in column A, a close of 1105.65 in column B
    and the natural log of the close for 11/24 divided by 11/23 in the column C [=LN
    (b3:b2)]. Column D is an average of the natural logs in column C [=average (c3:c12)],
    while column E simply subtracts column D from column C [=c3-d3]. Finally, Column
    F squares the results of column E [=e3^2] and cell F13 sums all the squares [=sum(f3:f12)].
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The calculations below the main table start by repeating the value of F13 in
    A16 [=f13] and stating the number of lookback periods in A17\. In A19, A16 is
    divided by A17 [=a16/a17]. A21 then takes the square root of the result from A19
    [=a19^1/2]. A23 takes the result from A21 and multiplies it by the square root
    of 252 [=a21*sqrt(252)]. Last but not least, A25 converts to result from A23 to
    a percentage [=a23*100], yielding a 10-day historical volatility of 15.63.

    to the bottom of the table, with one exception. That exception is column D, where
    the mean value – not the formula – is repeated throughout the table.

- en: If this seems like a lot of calculations to arrive at historical volatility
    value, there is a much shorter and slightly different way – and one that I believe
    generates a better number for traders.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The above calculations reflect a centered approach in which daily price changes
    are characterized relative to a mean value for the entire period. Another way
    to look at the same problem is to assume that in the long run, the mean change
    in price approaches zero and is not meaningful. As a corollary, if the mean is
    not meaningful, there is no reason to subtract it from the daily changes, so all
    the calculations involving the mean can be dropped. This is the non-centered approach
    to calculating historical volatility and is sometimes known as “ditching the mean”.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The resulting table below is much more manageable and easier to follow. The
    first three columns (date, close and natural log of the daily price change) are
    identical to those above. The fourth column simply takes the standard deviation
    of the natural log of the daily price changes, multiplies it by the square root
    of the number of trading days in a year (252) and coverts it to an annualized
    volatility percentage by multiplying by 100\. As a consequence, the formula in
    cell d12 below is simply =stdev(c3:c12)*sqrt(252)*100\. This formula can now be
    copied to the rows below to calculate subsequent historical volatility values.
    Note that unlike the centered approach, there are no additional calculations required
    beyond those in the main table.

    mean, how they can be modified, and why traders might prefer the non-centered
    historical volatility data to the centered historical volatility data.
