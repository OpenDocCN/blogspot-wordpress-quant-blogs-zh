    One Stop VIX-Centric View of the Universe…*” and it makes sense to share some
    of those chunks of data from time to time, even when I don’t think it will change
    the way anyone looks at the market.

- en: Now that I’ve lowered your expectations, I call your attention to the graphic
    below, which captures the movements in the various sector [SPDRs](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SPDRs)
    over the course of Monday to Tuesday, a day in which rumors of persistent difficulties
    at Lehman Brothers ([LEH](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/LEH)) helped
    to drag down the financial sector ETF ([XLF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLF))
    to its lowest level since March.  The [sectors](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/sectors)
    are ordered with the highest weighted ETF at the top ([XLK](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLK)
    - technology) and the lowest weighted ([XLU](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLU)
    - utilities) at the bottom.  With any luck, the balance of the graphic is self-explanatory.

- en: From a sector and volatility perspective, I found a few interesting tidbits
    from the graphic.  First of all, the change in the VIX and the change in the SPX
    implied volatility were almost identical, which is what you would expect.  I did
    find it interesting that the VIX jumped more than twice the percentage change
    in the mean IV across the nine sector ETFs.  Drilling down a little more, only
    three of the sectors had an increase in IV that was higher than the jump in the
    VIX -- and in each instance this was just barely the case.

- en: I have highlighted in green the two sectors in which the price of the ETF increased
    at the same time that implied volatility increased.  For the consumer discretionary
    sector ([XLY](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLY)), the change is
    not particularly dramatic, but for the materials sector ([XLB](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLB)),
    there is a substantial jump in IV on the heels of increasing price.  Needless
    to say, this is unusual.

- en: Part of the explanation for the large increase in the VIX (and SPX IV) relative
    to the individual sectors may come from the fact that the four most heavily weighted
    sector ETFs all had a substantial rise in IV, but even when taking this into consideration,
    the change in the VIX exceeds the change in the sum of the weighted parts.

    and [SPX-VIX correlation](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SPX-VIX%20correlation)
    analysis last year, you may recall that the median daily percentage move in the
    VIX is -4.2x of the daily move in the SPX.  For the record, yesterday the VIX
    moved 3.6x in the opposite direction of the SPX. In percentage terms, this is
    a fairly typical negative daily correlation number.  [Disclosure: Long LEH at
    time of writing.]'
