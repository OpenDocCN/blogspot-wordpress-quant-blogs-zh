    One Stop VIX-Centric View of the Universe…*” and it makes sense to share some
    of those chunks of data from time to time, even when I don’t think it will change
    the way anyone looks at the market.

- en: Now that I’ve lowered your expectations, I call your attention to the graphic
    below, which captures the movements in the various sector [SPDRs](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SPDRs)
    over the course of Monday to Tuesday, a day in which rumors of persistent difficulties
    at Lehman Brothers ([LEH](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/LEH)) helped
    to drag down the financial sector ETF ([XLF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLF))
    to its lowest level since March.  The [sectors](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/sectors)
    are ordered with the highest weighted ETF at the top ([XLK](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLK)
    - technology) and the lowest weighted ([XLU](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLU)
    - utilities) at the bottom.  With any luck, the balance of the graphic is self-explanatory.

  zh: 现在我已经降低了你们的期望，请关注下面的图表，它捕捉了周一至周二期间，各种行业[SPDRs](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SPDRs)的波动情况。在这段时间里，有关雷曼兄弟（[LEH](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/LEH)）持续困境的传言帮助拖累了金融行业ETF
    ([XLF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLF)) 至3月份以来的最低水平。各行业按权重最高的ETF([XLK](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLK)
    - 科技)排在顶部，权重最低的([XLU](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLU) - 公共事业)排在底部。如果运气好的话，图表的其余部分是自我解释的。
- en: From a sector and volatility perspective, I found a few interesting tidbits
    from the graphic.  First of all, the change in the VIX and the change in the SPX
    implied volatility were almost identical, which is what you would expect.  I did
    find it interesting that the VIX jumped more than twice the percentage change
    in the mean IV across the nine sector ETFs.  Drilling down a little more, only
    three of the sectors had an increase in IV that was higher than the jump in the
    VIX -- and in each instance this was just barely the case.

  zh: 从行业和波动性的角度来看，我发现图表中有几个有趣的小细节。首先，VIX和SPX隐含波动率的变化几乎是一致的，这是你所期望的。我也发现VIX的涨幅是九个行业ETF平均隐含波动率变化的两倍以上，这一点很有趣。更深入地挖掘，只有三个行业的隐含波动率上升超过了VIX的涨幅——而且每次都是勉强如此。
- en: I have highlighted in green the two sectors in which the price of the ETF increased
    at the same time that implied volatility increased.  For the consumer discretionary
    sector ([XLY](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLY)), the change is
    not particularly dramatic, but for the materials sector ([XLB](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLB)),
    there is a substantial jump in IV on the heels of increasing price.  Needless
    to say, this is unusual.

  zh: 我用绿色突出了两个行业，在这两个行业中，ETF的价格上涨的同时，隐含波动率也上涨。对于消费品行业([XLY](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLY))，变化并不特别显著，但对于材料行业([XLB](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLB))，在价格上涨之后，隐含波动率出现了大幅上升。不言而喻，这是不寻常的。
- en: Part of the explanation for the large increase in the VIX (and SPX IV) relative
    to the individual sectors may come from the fact that the four most heavily weighted
    sector ETFs all had a substantial rise in IV, but even when taking this into consideration,
    the change in the VIX exceeds the change in the sum of the weighted parts.

  zh: 波动率指数（VIX）与个别行业相比大幅上升的原因之一可能在于，权重最大的四个行业ETF都经历了隐含波动率的大幅上升，但即使考虑这一点，VIX的变化也超过了加权部分的变化。
- en: 'Finally, for anyone who followed my [fearogram](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/fearogram)
    and [SPX-VIX correlation](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SPX-VIX%20correlation)
    analysis last year, you may recall that the median daily percentage move in the
    VIX is -4.2x of the daily move in the SPX.  For the record, yesterday the VIX
    moved 3.6x in the opposite direction of the SPX. In percentage terms, this is
    a fairly typical negative daily correlation number.  [Disclosure: Long LEH at

  zh: 最后，对于那些去年关注过我的[恐慌指数图](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/fearogram)和[标普500与恐慌指数相关性](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SPX-VIX%20correlation)分析的人，你们可能还记得VIX每日百分比变动的中位数为标普500每日变动的-4.2倍。记录在案，昨天VIX的变动为SPX变动的3.6倍，方向相反。就百分比而言，这是一个相当典型的负每日相关性数字。  [披露：写作时持有LEH多头仓位。]
