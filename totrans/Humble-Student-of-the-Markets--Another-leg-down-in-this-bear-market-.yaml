    explanations advanced for the decline. My own take is that bearish traders flattened
    their positions ahead of the FOMC meeting. (The advance in the previous week looked
    suspiciously like a short-covering rally as the market seemed to rise on bad news.)
    When the Fed didn't surprise with another round of QE, the bears re-established
    their positions.
