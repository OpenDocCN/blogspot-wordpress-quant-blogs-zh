- en: Last week's post-FOMC selloff was truly breathtaking. There have been several
    explanations advanced for the decline. My own take is that bearish traders flattened
    their positions ahead of the FOMC meeting. (The advance in the previous week looked
    suspiciously like a short-covering rally as the market seemed to rise on bad news.)
    When the Fed didn't surprise with another round of QE, the bears re-established
    their positions.
