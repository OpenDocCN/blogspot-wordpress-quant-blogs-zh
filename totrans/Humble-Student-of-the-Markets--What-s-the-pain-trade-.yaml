    50 day moving average (dma) at 2040, while experiencing a positive divergence
    on RSI-5.

- en: The SPX saw a Golden Cross last week - and the right way to trade these signals
    is to use the faster moving average as a trailing stop. Until the 50 dma is breached
    in a definitive way, my inclination is to give the bull case the benefit of the
    doubt.

    the first year of an annual subscription. This offer is only available to the
    first 100 who sign up or until May 31, whichever comes first. Anything like this
    we do usually sells out fast so I suggest that you sign up ASAP before missing
    this golden opportunity.
