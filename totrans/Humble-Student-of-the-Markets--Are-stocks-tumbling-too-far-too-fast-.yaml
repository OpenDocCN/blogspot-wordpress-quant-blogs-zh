    Friday, my trend following models, which are always late by design but intended
    to spot longer dated market moves, were flashing urgent caution signals.

- en: A review of the short and intermediate term indicators this weekend, however,
    suggest that equity markets are due to stage an oversold rally next week. First
    of all, the term structure of the "fear curve" is flashing an oversold signal.
    The chart below shows the VIX/VXV ratio shows that the term structure of the VIX
    has inverted. On Friday, we saw an inversion as VIX close higher than three-month
    volatility (VXV).

    where the term structure of VIX has inverted (yellow zone). Eight of those occasions
    have signaled a short term market bottom (blue vertical lines).

    lines). The first, in 2010, prices did fall a little and then flattened out. The
    second and most notable decline occurred in the summer of 2011, which was plagued
    by the combination of a deadlock in Washington and the eurozone crisis - a vast
    difference in macro tail-risk compared to today.

    bet against those odds?

    moving average on Friday. In addition, the violation of the relative uptrend of
    junk bonds against US Treasuries indicating an interruption of the risk-on trade.
    While such readings are cause for concern, these could be minor violations and
    need to be confirmed by further weakness.

    market downturn are suggestive that prices are likely to bounce next week - at
    least until Wednesday when the FOMC announces its decision.

    weakness? As well, how will sentiment measures developing? The persistence of
    bullish sentiment will be contrarian bearish, while an upsurge in bearishness
    would be supportive of further stock market strength.
