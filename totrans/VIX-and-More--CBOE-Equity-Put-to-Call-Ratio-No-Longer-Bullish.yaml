- en: The CBOE equity put to call ratio, which Stockcharts.com and I refer to as [CPCE](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/CPCE),
    has been generating consistently bullish readings since the beginning of 2008.  Those
    bullish readings came to an end about a week or so ago, as the chart below reflects.  That
    does not necessarily mean that options sentiment is turning bearish, only that
    the ‘free lunch’ portion of the bounce off of the March low is over.  Now the
    likelihood of getting whipsawed – either on the long side or the short side –
    increases considerably.  I suspect that a couple more days like yesterday will
    push options sentiment back into the bullish contrarian camp, but that remains
    to be seen.  Until the market generates a stronger directional signal, priority
    should be given to conservative strategies.
