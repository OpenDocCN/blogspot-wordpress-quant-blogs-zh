- en: Going back to 2000 (as far as Nasdaq Spyx data has been calculated) there has
    only been one other time the market had back to back readings below 0\. That was
    the week ending 11/29/02, which came 7 weeks after the October 2002 bottom. It
    marked the top of that rally. From there it pulled back for over 3 months before
    the March 2003 rally and new bull market began. Similarly, we are now about 7
    weeks off of the March bottom.

    of 2008\. What followed that was obviously quite bearish over the next few months.

    weekly reading and then the Nasdaq has risen the next week. Those four instances
    along with their 8-week returns are listed below.

    It would be dangerous to draw conclusions from so few instances. Still, with such
    lopsided intermediate-term results its worth taking note. While the week is only
    2 days old, the indicator has yet to rise as of Tuesday’s close.

    breadth was more overdone by at least one measure than it’s been in decades. While
    price hasn’t yet begun to roll over the rate of ascension has certainly been slowed.
    The S&P hasn’t hit a new high in 7 trading days. This is the 1st consolidation
    of more than 4 days since the March lows. Are we setting up for a pullback or
    consolidation of several weeks? I don’t know. I am seeing some warning signs that
    would suggest caution. I’ll be keeping my eye out for more of them, as well.
