# VIX and More: Four Ways to Play VIX Options Following a Record 64% Move to 18.31

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/02/four-ways-to-play-vix-options-following.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/02/four-ways-to-play-vix-options-following.html#0001-01-01)

Not so much recommendations as strategies to think about.  I guarantee pricing on these and other strategies will change a great deal during the day, but looking at yesterday’s close and *not* taking into consideration this morning’s futures:

*   Bear put spread (ITM) – long the March 18s and short the 15s or 16s

*   Bear call spread (ATM) – short the March 17s or 18s and long the 20s or 22.5s
*   Outright purchase of puts (ITM) – March 22.5s or 25s
*   Short calendar spread (ATM) – short the March puts, long the April puts (probably the 18s or 20s)

Note that the suggested action targets March because reversion to the mean is a much better bet for the next 10-20 trading days than for April and beyond.

This presumes you have read my [caveats](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/02/how-to-think-about-day-after-executive_27.html) from earlier.  If you haven’t, I highly recommend that you do.  If the caveats haven’t sufficiently dampened your enthusiasm for VIX options, then before making any trades I suggest you think about how [Brian Overby](http://optionsguy.financialblogs.com/blog) at [TradeKing](http://optionsguy.financialblogs.com/post/blog/decoding_the_vix_ii.html) compares VIX options to [predicting the weather four months in advance based on current weather patterns](http://optionsguy.financialblogs.com/post/blog/decoding_the_vix_ii.html).

Good trading!
