- en: Recently, I have seen more and more concerns raised about the state of the employment
    market. Specifically, this chart of weekly initial unemployment claims (inverted
    scale) has had a tight inverse correlation with stock prices. As weekly initial
    claims are already at 20 year lows  claims will inevitably turn up at some point
    in the future. Will that rollover derail the stock bull?

    of how tight the labor market has become.

    of weekly initial claims data has been highly correlated with stock prices, but
    this correlation hasn't been as strong in other past periods. I went back to 1965,
    which was the start of the initial claims data history and analyzed the 1965-1986
    period. Stock prices had a rough inverse correlation for much of this study period.
    Then something funny happened in the mid-1980s as the recovery took hold - stock
    prices and claims went their separate ways as the inverse correlation broke down.
    Put it another way, the economy was improving and the labor market tightened,
    but the stock market shrugged off the labor market effects because of an improving
    growth outlook.

    down even more. Initial claims started to rise (recall the inverse scale) in the
    late 1980s, but stock prices did not break down until about a year afterwards.
    Claims were mostly flat in the 1990s, but stock prices went on a tear. Moreover,
    there was another episode about 1995 when claims rose but stock prices went up
    - until the inverse correlation re-asserted itself after the NASDAQ crash.

    6 months in this index, the above graph shows that, in context, it is not pointing
    to strong payrolls growth in the months ahead. Rather, I expect each such report
    to be lower than the conquerable report one year ago. This simply reinforeces
    the argument that we are past mid-cycle (as the YoY% growth in jobs generally
    peak near mid-cycle).
