- en: '[Martin Goldberg](http://www.financialsense.com/Market/goldberg/main.htm) has
    a [comprehensive review](http://www.financialsense.com/Market/goldberg/2007/0215.html)
    of the VIX on [Financial Sense](http://www.financialsense.com/index.html) in which
    he uses a variety of charts to support his claim that the VIX looks like a coiled
    spring that is ready to jump.  He argues that the markets will have difficulty
    going higher if the VIX does not continue lower, suggests that volatility is bottoming,
    and reminds us that “fear cannot go bankrupt.”'

- en: Brett Steenbarger at [TraderFeed](http://traderfeed.blogspot.com/2007/02/when-option-volatility-is-low-on.html)
    has an interesting look at [absolute and relative option volatility](http://traderfeed.blogspot.com/2007/02/when-option-volatility-is-low-on.html),
    with links back to much of his previous VIX research.  He also concludes that
    a market pullback is likely and bases this assessment on the current lows in both
    absolute and relative option volatility.
