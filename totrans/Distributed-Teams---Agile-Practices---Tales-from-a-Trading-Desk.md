# Distributed Teams – Agile Practices | Tales from a Trading Desk

## Distributed Teams – Agile Practices

Jutta Eckstein has an interesting [talk](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/agile-practices-distributed-teams) on InfoQ that discusses “Applying Agile Development Practices in Distributed Teams”.  Distributed teams working on the same project/code base are always challenging.  Code ownership is clearly called out in the talk for obvious reasons.

The Golden Rule slide offers some sensible rules for handover between location/time zones – build are green.  I would also add that ideally a CD process is being used, and the build has deployed successfully before handover to another region.
