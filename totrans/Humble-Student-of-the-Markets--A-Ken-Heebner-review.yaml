    tends to be macro-focused and he has a reputation for swinging for the fences,
    I was interested to see his factor exposures. With the caveat that this form of
    analysis isn''t perfect and the magnitudes of the exposure aren''t always well
    calibrated, here is my estimated factor beta exposures of CGMFX over the last
    few years.'

    Index is positive and growing, though it is unclear how much of that is related
    to the homebuilding position. Other notable sector exposures include an overweight
    in Financials, which has outperformed.

    buying a high price momentum portfolio.

    hurt badly during bear phases and market corrections. While I recognize that Ken
    Heebner is known not to be afraid to trade in and out of positions, investors
    should recognize the risks of this approach and diversify their style exposures
    accordingly.
