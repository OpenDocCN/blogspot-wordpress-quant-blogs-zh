- en: After a delightful month off travelling round Europe with the family, I’m now
    limbering up for a return to work. I’m very busy with the other half setting up
    a new venture that she’ll be operating while I’m at work in the City. And I’m
    enjoying reading Lars Kroijer’s Money Mavericks – an account of starting and running
    his own hedge fund. The first few chapters offer a great combo of amusing career
    anecdotage and nuts and bolts info on starting your own business.
