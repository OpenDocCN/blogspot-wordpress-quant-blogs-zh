- en: We need more Eichengreens, Shillers, Akerlofs, Reinharts, and Rogoffs – not
    to mention a Kindleberger, Minsky, or Bagehot...perhaps economics will remain
    a discipline that forgets most of what it once knew and allows itself to be continually
    distracted, confused, and in denial.

- en: Now, Rogoff has created some conventional macro models, but presumably is mentioned
    here because of his recent economic history book 'This Time It's Different' with
    Carmen Reinhart. Shiller's on the list presumably because he doesn't believe in
    the caricature of efficient markets, though no one believes in that caricature
    so I'm not sure what the alternative is. Akerloff's theory also highlights limits
    of efficient markets because of asymmetric information, though it should be mentioned
    that without the efficient markets benchmark, his result would be ambiguous, highlighting
    the usefulness of the benchmark.

    realize the value of assuming that markets efficient is useful because otherwise
    it would be too easy to generate alpha, and any thoughtful person should recognize
    this is difficult, or at least, rare.

- en: As to Kindleberger, Minsky, Bagehot, and Eichengreen, they tell stories. While
    these are very interesting, they aren't concise stories, and the older ones were
    especially vague and inconsistent. What is the essence of Bagehot's worldview?
    If these are the key writers, macro would have to admit it's best viewed like
    the field of history as opposed to physics.

- en: When we learned [Real Business Cycle theory], we were told that the measure
    of its success in explaining the data was - get this - that if you tweaked the
    parameters just right, you could get the theory to produce economic fluctuations
    of about the same size as the ones we see in real life... The editors of Econometrica,
    the American Economic Review, the Quarterly Journal of Economics, and the other
    top journals are the ones who publish paper after paper on these subjects, who
    accept "moment matching" as a standard of empirical verification, who approve
    of pages upon pages of math that tells "stories" instead of making quantitative
    predictions

- en: It would be interesting if macro moved away from its emphasis on Dynamic Stochastic
    General Equilibrium modeling. This toolset takes a major intellectual investment
    which makes one loathe to dismiss it, just as few who have read the Bible really
    carefully would admit it is insignificant, but clearly macro hasn't proved useful
    in explaining the big problems such as why Haiti is poor or what causes business
    cycles. After a couple decades I think it's fair to say this has been a dead end.

  zh: 若宏观经济学不再侧重于动态随机一般均衡建模，这将是很有意思的。这套工具需要重大的智力投入，这让人不愿摒弃它，就像少数倾心阅读《圣经》的人并不愿意承认其微不足道一样，但很明显，宏观经济学并没有在解释像海地为何贫穷或是什么导致商业周期等重大问题上证明有用。过去几十年来，我认为这一套是失败的。

    collection of anecdotes, rules of thumb, and manipulation of accounting data...The
    subsequent evolution from this conceptual potpourri to a rigorous economic theory
    subjected to scientific empirical examination was, of course, the work of many,
    but most observers would agree that Arrow, Debreu, Lintner, Markowitz, Miller,
    Modigliani, Samuelson, Sharpe and Tobin were the early pioneers in this transformation.'

- en: And this is the way the history of any field is written, principally by esteemed
    academics as a form of ancestor-worship, no doubt in the hope that they, too,
    will become ancestors worthy of worship. In this version, the history of finance,
    or macro, is that of the smooth and triumphant ascent of knowledge and technique,
    to our current state of unprecedented enlightenment. Yet it is clear that the
    big issues of macro and finance, which are closely related, have generated little
    knowledge or skill that could have helped practitioners about expected returns
    and economic growth relative to that acquired by economic historians.

- en: The essence of Macro was to leave the methodological individualism that is the
    essence of economics, and look instead at macro aggregates following laws of motion
    loosely motivated to look like supply and demand curves. One of the best decisions
    I ever made was to leave this field, because like being a learned Marxist or sociologist
    (same thing?), this may get you tenure, but you still don't understand anything.

    just as unhelpful today as it was in the Great Depression in terms of focusing
    the debate, eliminating irrelevant distractions. The same arguments are being
    made for more or less government. I don''t have the answers, but I do know that
    full-time macroeconomists are like active mutual fund managers: articulate, hard
