    short and lending long, or lending to lower credits in order to repair your balance
    sheet. When the Fed Chair tells you, "Last Call late this year", do you stick
    around for Last Call in order to make the last penny? No! The prudent course of
    action is to unwind your risk-on positions now. We are seeing the start of a new
    market regime as risk gets re-priced.

    the first round of Market Taperitis, that the effects of tapering had largely
    been discounted. Yet much of the de-risking had occurred in emerging market economies
    and the initial shock of even the prospect of QE tapering nearly caused an EM
    currency crisis.

    indicates that global portfolio flows can overwhelm local country effects (emphasis

- en: We find that the structures of both the investor base and local financial systems
    matter. The new mix of global portfolio investors is likely to make overall portfolio
    flows more sensitive to global financial conditions. The share of more volatile
    bond flows has risen, and larger foreign participation in local markets can transmit
    new instability. ***Growing investment from institutional investors that are generally
    more stable during normal times is welcome, but these investors can pull back
    more strongly and persistently when facing an extreme shock. While domestic macroeconomic
    conditions matter, investor herding among global funds continues, and there are
    few signs of increasing differentiation along macroeconomic fundamentals during
    crises over the past 15 years.*** Nonetheless, the progress made by emerging markets
    toward strengthening their financial systems reduces their financial asset prices’
    sensitivity to global financial shocks.

    bonds flows – especially from retail investors. The IMF found that bond mutual
    funds typically used by retail investors are far more sensitive to global sentiment
    than institutional bond investors such as pension, insurance or sovereign wealth
    funds. Moreover, bond mutual funds are twice as sensitive as equity mutual funds.

    become too big for many emerging markets. When capital is pulled out by fund managers
    there are insufficient local buyers to step in. Turbulence inevitably ensues.

    a professor of economics at London Business School, presented a paper identifying
    how the Fed drives a common global financial cycle influenced by investors’ risk
    appetites that often renders impotent actions by national authorities. The crucial
    role played by bond funds identified by the IMF helps explain those linkages.

    event such as a financial blow-up in China, the risk premium shrinkage in the
    emerging markets appears to be largely over. I had been monitoring the relative
    performance of the EM bond ETF (EMB) against US junk bond ETF (HYG) as a measure
    of risk appetite for EM bonds in the junk bond (EM) vs. junk bond (US) space.
    As the chart below shows, the relative performance of EMB has stabilized against
    HYG and has started to recover a little.

    to other markets. As an example, the chart below of the relative performance of
    US junk bonds (HYG) against corporate debt (LQD) shows the formation of a broad
    top. HYG broke down from a relative uptrend against LQD and started to trade sideways.
    Such consolidations are often preludes to a rollover in risk appetite.

    stocks are part of typical topping patterns in overall risk appetite. While breadth
    indicators, such as the Advance-Decline Line remains healthy as it has confirmed
    the new SPX highs by making new highs of its own, which indicates that further
    new highs in the major US market averages are possible, the decline in risk aversion
    has to be regarded as a cautionary signal for stock investors.
