    of bulls retreating. A good analogue to the current period is the August 2010
    when Ben Bernanke hinted at QE2 at Jackson Hole in August 2010\. Back then, the
    number of bulls spiked to a crowded long reading the Jackson Hole speech. Bullish
    sentiment retreated soon after, just as it is doing today.

    from monetary stimulus and the beta chasing activity of underweight institutions
    and hedge funds are reasons why equity markets are likely to power ahead to further
