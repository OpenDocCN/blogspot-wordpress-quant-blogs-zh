- en: Now, if there were investors with experience in mortgage backed securities (the
    Elgible Assets) with a thorough track record, what are the odds they were drinking
    the Kool-Aid about mortgage innovations? No money down, 'outdated' underwriting
    criteria, record increases in housing prices, etc., and nothing sounded an alarm.
    These are the guys we want to save us?

    at mortgages. The mortgage crisis caught us by surprise but we had no reason to
    really examine mortgages or housing price data carefully, other than to note anecdotally
    stories about housing prices. I think it is wrong to assume, with hindsight, this
    was an easy bubble to call. More likely, savvy people looking at this figured
    something did not seem right, so merely choose a different field because in general
    it does not pay well to be short, either as an investor, or attitudinally within
    an long-oriented organization or group. I imagine most who thoughtfully examined
    the trends merely weren't in the business of buying MBS as opposed to shorting
    them. But if this was your full time job, you have demonstrated a very large error
    in your analytics, because you were almost certainly a bull throughout. Surely
    a small portion got out, or went short, but of those who match the other Treasury
    Criteria (eg, you have $10B under management, and can fill out paperwork by April
    10) and whose stock rose dramatically anticipating a huge government subsidy (eg,
    FIG, BKCC, JNS, EPHC, BX),

    2003, there are times when your profession showed a complete lack of ability to
    capture the Most Important Thing in the subject of their expertise. If you were
    not considered a screwball renegade before events made things obvious, you are
    a fool, fraud or dup whose experience is damning. An expert would more likely
    be someone in a related asset class, not the class in question.
