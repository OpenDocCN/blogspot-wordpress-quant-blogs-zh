    or the potential for more volatility.  [COVID-19](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/COVID-19)
    cases are spiking to new highs in Europe and the U.S. and could be at an inflection
    point in the U.S.  Election uncertainty is also unnerving investors with the election
    only nine days away.  Lasts and not least, markets are strongly influenced by
    the Pelosi-Mnuchin stimulus dance, which appears to have migrated from a tango
    to a polka – but at least the music is still playing.

    in the volatility world and the [VIX ETP](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20ETN)
    space has also changed dramatically.  For this reason, it seems like a good time
    to update a favored VIX ETP graphic to reflect the many products that have closed,
    matured and been moved to the pink sheets.  In keeping with tradition (this graphic
    has been published many times in various incarnations since 2010), I have plotted
    all of the VIX ETPs with respect to their target maturity (X-axis) and leverage
    (Y-axis).

  zh: 自从我是这个领域的常规贡献者以来，市场波动性世界发生了很多变化，VIX ETP 领域也发生了巨大变化。因此，现在似乎是时候更新一个备受青睐的 VIX ETP
    图表，以反映已关闭、到期和移至粉红单据的许多产品。按照传统（自 2010 年以来，这个图表已经以各种形式多次发布），我将所有的 VIX ETP 都绘制在其目标到期日（X
    轴）和杠杆（Y 轴）方面。

- en: '**[VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX) (iPath Series B S&P
    500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN**) – the pioneering +1 long volatility ETN that
    [launched back on January 30, 2009](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/01/first-day-of-trading-in-vxx-and-vxz.html)
    and has been the dominant product in the VIX ETP space throughout its lifetime'

    500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN**）- 这是一款创新的 +1 长期波动率 ETN，[于 2009 年 1 月 30 日推出](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/01/first-day-of-trading-in-vxx-and-vxz.html)，在其存在期间一直是
    VIX ETP 领域的主导产品'
- en: '**[UVXY](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/UVXY) (ProShares Ultra
    VIX Short-Term Futures ETF**) – the +1.5x ETF that spent most of its life as a
    +2x product and moved to +1.5x following the February 2018 [Volmageddon](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Volmageddon)
    event which resulted in the termination of XIV'

    事件后大部分时间作为 +2x 产品存在，并在 XIV 的终止后改为 +1.5x'
- en: Both VXX and UVXY trade an average of over 30 million shares per day and both
    are regularly in the top 5-10 highest volume ETPs as well as ETP options volume
    leaders.  The remaining VIX ETPs have been largely relegated to niche product
    status.  Additionally, Credit Suisse delisted and suspended its VelocityShares
    ETNs, meaning that the former [TVIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TVIX),
    [VIIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIIX) and [ZIV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/ZIV)
    now trade in the OTC market under the symbols [TVIXF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TVIXF),
    [VIIXF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIIXF) and [ZIVZF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/ZIVZF). 
    For this reason and because of low liquidity and the increased risk with trading
    on the OTC “pink sheets.” I have highlighted these tickers in red.

  zh: VXX和UVXY的交易量平均超过3000万股/日，它们都经常位于最高交易量ETP的前5-10名，以及ETP期权交易量领导者。 剩下的VIX ETP大多被归类为利基产品。
    此外，瑞士信贷已从交易所撤销和暂停了其VelocityShares ETN，这意味着原来的[TVIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TVIX)，[VIIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIIX)和[ZIV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/ZIV)现在在场外市场以[T...](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TVIXF)，[VIIXF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIIXF)和[ZIVZF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/ZIVZF)的符号交易。
    出于这个原因，以及因为场外“粉红单据”上交易的低流动性和增加的风险。 我用红色突出显示了这些股票代码。
