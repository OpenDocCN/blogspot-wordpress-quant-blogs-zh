# Serverless – Real World Usage | Tales from a Trading Desk

## Serverless – Real World Usage

Great [posting](https://fmlnerd.com/2016/08/16/30k-page-views-for-0-21-a-serverless-story/) by Pete Johnson on a serverless application, “30K Page Views for $0.21: A Serverless Story”.  Its interesting to read a read world application that leverages AWS  Lambda functions coupled with S3 storage, providing real data on the extremely low charges for the number of page views.  If nothing else, read the “What I’ve Found is Cool (and Not) About Lambda” section 🙂
