- en: I want to address in this post the likely effects of this shift in central bank
    thinking on market prices. In the wake of the near-death experience of the Lehman
    Crisis of 2008, central bankers have taken steps to put a floor on the price of
    financial assets. Market analysts have called this the Bernanke Put, as applied
    to the Federal Reserve, and the Draghi Put, as applied to the European Central
    Bank. These central bank Puts function like an insurance policy with a deductible.
    Investors assume some degree of risk, the deductible, but if the macro-economic
    situation deteriorates to the extent that a market crash is likely, major global
    central banks have they will step in to rescue the markets.

    posits that asset returns follow a bell-shaped distribution. The graph below shows
    an idealized Gaussian distribution with the returns plotted on the x-axis and
    frequency, or probability, of those returns on the y-axis. (Yes I know it's not normally
    distributed but has fatter tails, but it is still a bell-shaped curve.) But what
    happens to the return distribution when central bankers try to eliminate or reduce
    the left tail of the return distribution?

    “all austerity, all the time” and a social consensus that is tilted towards a
    relatively robust safety net, the ECB has traded off the certainty of a no Eurogeddon
    scenario against lower growth, as depicted by the idealized graph on the below.
    Note how the expected return distribution is no longer symmetrical as the left
    tail has been cut off. The “mode”, or the value that is likely to appear the most,
    is also skewed to the left.

    been associated with low uncertainty, but we are still seeing high levels of uncertainty
    in FX. This is understandable given the large number of risks across multiple
    regions (for example, Eurozone financial crisis, weak US growth, US fiscal cliff
    and China slowdown). Further, ***these types of risks leave investors tracking
    policy makers and trading news headlines for policy trajectory information.***
    This is resulting in sudden and rapid moves in FX followed by periods of range-trading.
