- en: It's time for one of my periodic reviews of the market from a factor and sector
    perspective. These reviews are useful inasmuch as they can reveal insights about
    the character of a market.

- en: Let's begin with how different regions are performing relative to the MSCI All-Country
    World Index (ACWI). The top panel shows the S&P 500 rolling over relative to global
    stocks. Even the NASDAQ 100, which had been the market leaders, may be losing
    relative momentum and starting to trade sideways. The middle panel shows the relative
    performance of two major developed market regions. Japan is underperforming, and
    Europe is not showing signs of market leadership as it is trading sideways on
    a relative return basis. The bottom panel shows the relative performance of emerging
    market equities. Both EM and EM xChina are starting to bottom and exhibit relative
    strength, which is a possible sign of a global cyclical rebound, as EM equities
    tend to be high beta and highly cyclically sensitive.
