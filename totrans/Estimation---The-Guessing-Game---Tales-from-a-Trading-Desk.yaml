    estimates and guesses ‚Äì and there may be serious flaws in your assumptions.

- en: If we approve a project based on a year‚Äôs worth of work, and we estimate it
    and we think it is all good, there is a lot of risk inherent in there. But also,
    and this is worse, we might ditch doing something really, really valuable for
    the company because we have clumped together all this value into a year-long project
    and we are making a really big decision ‚Äì to go or no go ‚Äì based only on that
    clump.

- en: Big, up-front project thinking is essentially a lot of assumptions. According
    to the traditional assumption life cycle, we have business requirements, functional
    requirements, and they turn into development and then delivery. Actually, these
    business requirements that we come up with are all assumptions. We do not actually
    know these things are valid at all. We say, ‚ÄúWell, these are our business requirements.
    Let‚Äôs decide how we will deliver those and get some functional requirements around
    those‚Äù. These are just hypotheses
