# Open Source – WinJS, Roslyn and Comanche054/Luminary099 | Tales from a Trading Desk

## Open Source – WinJS, Roslyn and Comanche054/Luminary099

So by far the coolest of these has to be the open sourcing of  [Apollo](http://googlecode.blogspot.co.uk/2009/07/apollo-11-missions-40th-anniversary-one.html) 11 Command Module code (Comanche054) and Lunar Module code (Luminary099)

More up to date, will [WinJS](http://blogs.windows.com/windows/b/buildingapps/archive/2014/04/02/bringing-winjs-cross-platform-and-open-source.aspx) make headway in the non Windows space?

To wrap up, there’s .NET Compiler Platform (“[Roslyn](http://roslyn.codeplex.com/)“)

> The .NET Compiler Platform (“Roslyn”) exposes a set of Compiler APIs and Workspaces APIs that provides rich information about your source code and that has full fidelity with the C# and Visual Basic languages. The transition to compilers as a platform dramatically lowers the barrier to entry for creating code focused tools and applications. It creates many opportunities for innovation in areas such as meta-programming, code generation and transformation, interactive use of the C# and VB languages, and embedding of C# and VB in domain specific languages.
