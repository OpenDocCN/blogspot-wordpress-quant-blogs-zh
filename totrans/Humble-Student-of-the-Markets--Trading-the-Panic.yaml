    is the market oversold, but also extreme fear is showing up in sentiment readings.
    The weekly AAII survey has flashed a contrarian buy signal for a second consecutive
    week. Not only is the bull-bear spread at an extreme seen only two other times
    in the last 10 years, but also bearish sentiment is the fourth highest on record
    in the same period.
