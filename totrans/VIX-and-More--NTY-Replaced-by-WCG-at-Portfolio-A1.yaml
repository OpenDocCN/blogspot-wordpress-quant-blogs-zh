    has secretly been hoping for all along.  In this case, I got my wish and Portfolio
    A1 has dropped [NTY](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=nty) and replaced it with [WCG](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=wcg),
    the portfolio’s first foray into health care, a sector that has been performing
    exceptionally well as of late, as reflected in the [XLV](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=xlv)
    ETF, among other barometers.

    with possible buyout rumors.  Generally, the discretionary trader in me looks
    to sell long positions on buyout rumors, but in this case Portfolio A1’s stock
    ranking algorithm dropped NTY due to poor performance relative to the other holdings
    and to WCG.  A close look at the [WCG chart](http://stockcharts.com/charts/gallery.html?wcg)
    shows that the stock’s price action strongly resembles that of a airplane taking
    off, as the stock as steadily gained altitude in the course of tripling from November
    2005 to the present.

    Portfolio Challenge](http://contests.cnbc.com/milliondollar/contestmain.do). This
    is still in the top 1%, but below my ranking from last [Wednesday](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/04/cnbc-million-dollar-portfolio-challenge.html)
    and still some $700,000 out of the top 20.  The good news is that earnings season
    is beginning this coming week – and with it some opportunities to take some big
    chances and make some big moves.  Hey, if Zach Johnson can win the Masters, anything
    is possible!)'
