# Algodeal (1) Introduction | Quant Corner

> 来源：[https://quantcorner.wordpress.com/2011/05/24/algodeal-1-introduction/#0001-01-01](https://quantcorner.wordpress.com/2011/05/24/algodeal-1-introduction/#0001-01-01)

I have been busy with getting to know **[Algodeal](https://beta.algodeal.com/)** on these days. **Algodeal** is an automated trading strategy online platform. This project is relatively new, and it doesn’t seem to be well-known, yet. Googling ‘algodeal’ actually returns less than 7000 internet pages.

What is **Algodeal** ?

As the **Algodeal** website reads it offers an infrastructure for designing, backtesting and analysing quant strategies.

**Algodeal** provides a development environment called **Market Runner**, the prevailing programming language being **Java**. Among other things, the **Algodeal** team gives some help on how to install and use **Eclipse** and **NetBeans** together with their envronment. A series of tutorials, sample code examples, and various code snippets are provided as well.

How does **Algodeal** work ?

Actually, one can work on his home machine or send out its code to the **Algodeal** servers. And, one can develop strategies without  even using **Market Runner**.

Nonetheless, a typical use of the **Algodeal** platform – at least, in our case  – is as follows :

–      Coding an automated-trading strategy in **Java** using an **IDE**.

–      Sending out our strategy to the **Algodeal** online platform (that is “Run Strategy Remote”)

–      Receiving back  a series of performance indicators (P&L, number of trades, graphs … ) from the grid of **Algodeal**.

–      Based on those results, improving the automated trading strategy, and going through a new cycle …

Hopefully, we will develop a high-performance algorithm that **Algodeal** would use for *real* trading.  It will make *real* money, and we would receive part of the returns.

Some disagree with the fact that the returns from the real investments made based on the strategies submitted by the users are shared together with **Algodeal**. I am not going to spend much time at debating. The **Algodeal** project seems fair to me as it provides with a *free* online grid, time series, a development environment, **Java** classes … Moreover – and, not the least – I do not put my own money at stake.
