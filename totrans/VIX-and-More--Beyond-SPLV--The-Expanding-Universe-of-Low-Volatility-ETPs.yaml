- en: The spike in volatility that hit a climax on Monday has apparently passed with
    the swiftness of a summer thunderstorm. Of course, as I explained more than six
    years ago in [What My Dog Can Tell Us About Volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/01/what-my-dog-can-tell-us-about_947.html),
    things are never really quite the same after the storm passes, which is why we
    often encounter a phenomenon I call [echo volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/echo%20volatility).

    and actively seek out strategies that minimize the volatility of their portfolios.
    This low volatility approach has a great deal of merit and a fair amount of academic
    studies to support the rationale behind low volatility investing. For those who
    might not be interested in wading through the academic literature, the chart below
    shows how SPLV has significantly outperformed SPY since its launch, with substantially
    less volatility along the way.

    a variety of low volatility sector ETPs, such as utilities ([XLU](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLU))
    and consumer staples ([XLP](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLP))
    as well as a strong selection of value-oriented ETPs (e.g., [IWD](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/IWD)
    and [VTV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VTV)) and dividend-focused
    ETPs (e.g., [VIG](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIG), [DVY](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/DVY)
    and [SDY](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SDY)), but it was not until
    May 2011 that there was an exchange-traded product that specifically target low
    volatility holdings. Enter the [PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility Portfolio](http://www.invescopowershares.com/products/overview.aspx?ticker=SPLV)
    ETN ([SPLV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SPLV)), which immediately
    began attracting a following and now has $3.4 billion of assets. SPLV had the
    benefit of being first to market, but its success has prompted the launch of many
    similar products, of which the most successful has probably been the iShares MSCI
    USA Minimum Volatility ETF ([USMV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/USMV)).
    Since then, PowerShares and iShares have expanded their product line of low volatility
    ETPs to cover international stocks ([EFAV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EFAV),[ACWV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/ACWV),
    [IDLV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/IDLV)) and emerging markets
    ([EEMV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EEMV), [EELV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EELV)).

- en: The newest battleground in the low volatility race is a U.S. market cap focus,
    with the launch by PowerShares of the PowerShares S&P Mid Cap Low Volatility Portfolio
    ([XMLV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XMLV)) ETN and the PowerShares
    S&P Small Cap Low Volatility Portfolio ([XSLV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XSLV))
    ETN earlier this month. I mention these two new entrants because the distinction
    between these two and SPLV is much more than the market cap. Indeed, the differences
    in sector weighting are at least as substantial as the differences in market cap.
    Starting with SPLV as a benchmark, here the current sector weightings are 31%
    utilities, 24% consumer staples and 15% financials. In contrast, XMLV is weighted
    with 51% financials, 24% utilities and no other sector representing more than
    8% of the portfolio. Not too dissimilar is XSLV, which is weighted 50% in financials
    and 16% in utilities. The bottom line is that these two new products are not just
    smaller cap versions of SPLV, but portfolios with a strong financial component,
    very little exposure to consumer staples and more exposure to sectors such as
    information technology and industrials, so the redundancy between SPLV and either
    XMLV or XSLV is smaller than one might expect.

    portion of their portfolio dedicated to lower volatility instruments. While more
    traditional sector, value and dividend approaches still make some sense, the expanding
    menu of targeted low volatility products certainly deserve a long look as well
    – preferably before the next big volatility storm.
