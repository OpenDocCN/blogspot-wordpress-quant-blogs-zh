- en: LIQUi|> is a software architecture and toolsuite for quantum computing. It is
    currently being developed and will include programming languages, optimization
    and scheduling algorithms, and quantum simulators. Ultimately, LIQUi|> will be
    used to translate a quantum algorithm written in the form of a high-level program
    into the low-level machine instructions for a quantum device.
