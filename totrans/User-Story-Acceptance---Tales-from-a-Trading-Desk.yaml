- en: The writing of stories in agile sometimes causes confusion for those who haven’t
    written stories previously.  Assuming you manage to get over the story hurdle,
    and followed the advice/template from Mike [Cohn](http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/advantages-of-the-as-a-user-i-want-user-story-template)
    and co., you’ll then move onto the next hurdle, story acceptance criteria.  Acceptance
    provides the details on what must pass before the story is said to be “Done”.  
    Acceptance comes in a few flavors:  [scenario](http://agilecoach.typepad.com/agile-coaching/2011/07/when-to-write-story-tests.html)
    and [criteria](http://lizkeogh.com/2011/06/20/acceptance-criteria-vs-scenarios/)/tests. 
    Acceptance criteria/test are basically scripts, where as criteria state the boundary
    of the story.  Behavior-Driven Development ([BDD](http://www.slideshare.net/arifont/exploring-ux-techniques-and-practices-4-product-development))
    has in recent years become the tool of choice for acceptance tests, allowing text
    to be written in a [business-readable domain-specific language](http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/BusinessReadableDSL.html)
    and serves as documentation, automated tests and development-aid – see [Cucumber](http://cukes.info/).

    the acceptance tests.  Exploring UX Techniques and Practices (Agile 2012) offers
    a [view](https://speakerdeck.com/u/ariadna/p/exploring-ux-techniques-and-practices-agile-2012),
    which is probably worth [reading](http://www.andersramsay.com/2011/07/24/the-ux-of-user-stories-part-2)
    in [conjunction](http://chrismdp.github.com/2011/09/layers-of-abstraction-bdd-ux/)
    with Gokjo’s posting – [How to implement UI testing without shooting yourself
    in the foot](http://gojko.net/2010/04/13/how-to-implement-ui-testing-without-shooting-yourself-in-the-foot-2/).

    [add](http://www.jeffgothelf.com/blog/published-articles/) appropriate acceptance
    criteria and tests, then you should be in a better place to capture the Product
    Owners requirements, and ensure stories can be [tests](http://www.romanpichler.com/blog/user-stories/writing-good-user-stories/),
    and thus marked “done”.
