    implement our desired allocation. In many cases we will allocate capital to the
    mutual fund managers who will invest money according to their fund’s mandate.
    Usually there is no perfect relationship between asset classes and fund managers.
    To determine the true style of a manager one can examine its historical holdings
    or perform a Style Analysis. Style Analysis is a procedure that tries to attribute
    funds performance to the performance of asset classes by running the constrained
    linear regression. For a detailed review of Style Analysis I recommend following
    articles:'

    true, is to look at the fund memorandum and historical holdings. For now, I will
    assume that the asset class allocations can vary around the current fund’s allocations.

- en: The last style allocation looks more probable. If historical fund’s holdings
    were readily available we could have examined them to refine the upper and lower
    boundaries. The last step is to analyze fund’s actual returns vs returns implied
    by its style matrix.

- en: The Fidelity Worldwide Fund outperformed its proxy, implied from the style matrix,
    consistently over the last decade. The fund’s alpha is 2.9% and standard deviation
    of alpha is 3.9%. So if you want to invest into Worldwide Fund, the Fidelity Worldwide
    Fund is not a bad choice.
