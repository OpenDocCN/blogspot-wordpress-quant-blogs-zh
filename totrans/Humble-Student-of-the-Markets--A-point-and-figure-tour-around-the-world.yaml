    the daily or weekly squiggles of the market. One useful technique of filtering
    out market squiggles is the point and figure (P&F) chart, which StockCharts describes
    this way:'

- en: Point & Figure charts consist of columns of X’s and O’s that represent filtered
    price movements. X-Columns represent rising prices and O-Columns represent falling
    prices. Each price box represents a specific value that price must reach to warrant
    an X or an O. Time is not a factor in P&F charting; these charts evolve as prices
    move. No movement in price means no change in the P&F chart.

    especially useful to interpret big picture patterns. Measured price objectives
    can be useful as indications of possible direction, but they have to be taken
    with a grain of salt.

    World Index (ACWI) in USD with a 1% box and 3-box reversal. The index is correcting
    in the context of a recovery from a bear market. The measured price objective
    of 108.98 is a useful indication of the upside potential of the move.
