- en: I am seeing some signs that the market is likely to pull back in the next few
    days.  On Tuesday the SPX closed just slightly higher while the VIX also rose.
     This triggered the study below, which I have showed before in the subscriber
    letter, but never here on the blog.

- en: The reason it only looks at Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday is that Monday
    and Friday VIX prices tend to be affected by weekend time decay in the options
    market. Instances are a little low but really could not appear more bearish over
    the next 2 days.
