- en: 'Benford''s law, also called the first-digit law, states that in lists of numbers
    from many real-life sources of data, the leading digit is distributed in a specific,
    non-uniform way. According to this law, the first digit is 1 almost one third
    of the time, and larger digits occur as the leading digit with lower and lower
    frequency, to the point where 9 as a first digit occurs less than one time in
    twenty. Hal Varian noted this could be used to detect accounting fraud way back
    in 1972\. Here are the proportions of the leading digit according to Benford''s
    law compared to Madoff''s numbers (sample size, 171):'

- en: did a similar analysis and got different results, so I redid the analysis, and
    got different results! My bad. I do note that the number of 1's is now outside
    of 2 stds. Out of 173 data points (12 years plus 5 months minus two zeros), I
    have 70 observations with leading 1's. But, if the mean return is really 0.96
    with minimal vol, one could say this naturally violates Benford's law.
