    Intranet, and have been devouring each issue with relish.

- en: They release two reports per month; a Research Report that contains about 10
    articles dealing with a specific area of financial IT, and a briefer Management
    Report. For instance, one article might give an overview of ECNs, talk about the
    current trends in ECN usage, and give a brief overview of the various vendors
    in that space. They will also survey a number of financial firms to find out what
    they are currently using.

- en: The last few pages of each report are devoted to news, so you can find out about
    new products, who has changed companies, and who has bought out whom.

    I am) and needed to get up to speed on a certain domain, I would certainly reach
    for a Lepus Report to get a quick backgrounder.
