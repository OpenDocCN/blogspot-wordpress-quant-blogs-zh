    of the Troika for financing. What if the Greeks got tired of the pain and turned
    to Putin for relief? Moscow has long had a historical desires for the warm waters
    of the Mediterranean for centuries. A financing deal could have shook up NATO
    and significantly shifted the geopolitical balance in the Eastern Med.

    4.5 percent to help it service its debt. Cyprus now needs at least 1.8 billion

    crisis is getting out of hand. The chart below shows the relative return of the
    ETF of Greek stocks (GREK) against large cap eurozone stocks (FEZ). The GREK/FEZ
    ratio has declined and it is testing a relative support zone. Should it break
    support, then it's time to get more cautious.

    debt. As well, the Greek stock market is the high beta "canary in the coalmine"
