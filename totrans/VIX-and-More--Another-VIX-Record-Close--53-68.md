# VIX and More: Another VIX Record Close: 53.68

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/10/another-vix-record-close-5368.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/10/another-vix-record-close-5368.html#0001-01-01)

The VIX handily surpassed yesterday's record close of 52.05 by establishing a new mark of 53.68 today.

For most of today's session, yesterday's VIX record looked safe, until a flurry of selling in the last half hour lifted the VIX to a new end of day high. Today is the third record close for the VIX in the last seven sessions. Also of interest, today's intra-day high of 54.19 was the second highest on record, behind yesterday's 58.24 mark.

One bit of obscure VIX trivia: today the VIX closed 116% above the 100 day moving average of 24.87, yet another VIX record.

As a reminder, VIX calculations continue until 4:15 p.m. ET, which is when trading ends for the underlying SPX options.
