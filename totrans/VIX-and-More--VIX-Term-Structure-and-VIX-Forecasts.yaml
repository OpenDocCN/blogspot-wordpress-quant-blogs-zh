    Show Traders Betting Stock Rally to End](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601084&sid=aL67pJSx90Is&refer=stocks)
    that triggered a large number of emails from readers. The quote from the article
    that seemed to generate the most amount of interest was, “Investors surveyed by
    [Macro Risk Advisors](http://www.macroriskadvisors.com/) expect the VIX to jump
    to as much as 51.70 by year end.” In fact, the 51.70 data point was the average
    high print expected by respondents who were surveyed in April, when the VIX ranged
    from 33 to 46\. That data point and the balance of the results from the [Volatility
    Forecast Survey](http://www.macroriskadvisors.com/layout/pdf/Volatility_Forecast_Survey_2009.pdf)
    make for some interesting reading. Even more interesting, however, is the April
    2008 [Volatility Forecast Survey](http://www.macroriskadvisors.com/layout/pdf/MRA1_VOLSURVEY20Updated.pdf),
    in which respondents expected average realized volatility of 20.9% for the balance
    of 2008, with an average VIX high print of 34.4\. One brave soul went out on a
    limb and predicted that the VIX would spike to a new all-time high of 50.

    from historical data, they were having trouble imagining what was coming.

    a lot less credence into survey data that is several weeks old than real-time
    market data. One can construct a VIX [term structure](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/term%20structure)
    graph from [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20options)
    or SPX options. My preference is for the latter approach, which yields a graph
    like the one below. Note that the slope of the VIX term structure is almost flat.
    Certainly the 0.11 differential between the front month and 2 ½ years out is in
    stark contrast to the [33.93 point differential](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/12/vix-term-structure-chances-since.html)
    from November 20, 2008, when the front month VIX was 81.07\. Essentially, the
    consensus opinion is that current volatility measures are about where they should
    be, with no significant changes anticipated going forward.

    their [volatility forecasts](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/volatility%20forecast)
    last month, there is nothing like current market data to get a sense of how investors
    are backing up their beliefs with large dollar value positions in the options
    market.
