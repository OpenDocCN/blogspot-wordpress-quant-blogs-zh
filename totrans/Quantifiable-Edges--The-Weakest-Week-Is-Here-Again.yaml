    to have a pullback than this upcoming week.  Since 1961 (and over most every time
    period) the week following the 3rd Friday in September has produced the most bearish
    results of any week.  In the 9/24/12 blog I showed a chart of SPX performance
    during this week since 1961\.  I have updated that chart below.

    52 years.  There was a stretch in the late 80’s where there was a series of mild
    up years.  Since 1990 it has been pretty much all downhill, and last year was
    no exception.
