- en: the uselessness of factor models in predicting short term return, and the unreliability
    of many exotic factors even for the long term. In particular, factor models are
    especially inaccurate in valuing growth stocks (i.e. stocks with low book-to-market
    ratio), as evidenced by such models' poor performance during the internet bubble.
    This is not surprising because most commonly used factors rely on historical sales
    or earnings measures to judge companies, while many growth stocks have very short
    history and little or no earnings to report. However, as pointed out recently

- en: By "normalized", I mean we need to standardize the numbers with respect to the
    industry median. To Prof. Mohanram's credit, he claims only that these factors
    will generate returns after 1 or 2 years, not the short-term returns that many
    traders expect factor models to deliver. The excess annual return based on buying
    the group of stocks with the highest score and shorting the group with the lowest
    score is a good 21.4%. Not only does the combined score generate good returns,
    but each individual factor also delivers good correlation with future returns,
    proving that the performance is not due to some questionable alchemy of mixing
    the factors. For example, it makes good intuitive sense that extra spending on
    R&D and advertising will boost future earnings for growth stocks.

    the high-score stocks occur around earnings announcements. Hence for those investors
    who don't like holding a long-short portfolio for a full year, they can just trade
    during earnings season.

- en: One caveat of this research is that it was based on 1979-99 data (at least for
    the preprint version that I read). As many traders have found out, strategies
    that work spectacularly in the 90's don't necessarily work in the last few years.
    At the very least, the returns are usually greatly diminished. In the future,
    I hope to perform my own research to see whether this strategy is still holding
    up with the latest data.
