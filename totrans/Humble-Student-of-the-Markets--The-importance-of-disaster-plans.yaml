    before takeoff, not after the wings fall off the plane. You must have a plan in
    place to deal with unanticipated events, a just-in-case things head south scenario.

    calmly contemplative — not when things are figuratively and literally melting

    they do happen. With the onset of QE2, I have seen too many people focus only
    on the upside (e.g. rare earths as the hot new story du jour) without thinking
    about the risks involved. When markets de-risk and investors head for the exits,
    those without a risk management plan in place often get trampled.

    of escaping and reconnecting with loved ones if they have a personal contingency
    plan. While such planning is critically important for people who live and work
    overseas in high-threat locations, recent events have demonstrated that even people
    residing in places considered safe, like Cairo and Tokyo, can be caught in the
    vortex of a crisis. Taking this one step further, sudden disasters, such as tornadoes,
    earthquakes, school shootings or the derailment of train cars carrying chlorine,
    can strike almost anywhere. This means that everyone should have a personal contingency
    plan.

    also for families and individuals.*** Such plans should be in place for each regular
    location — home, work and school — that an individual frequents and should cover
    what that person will do and where he or she will go should an evacuation be necessary.
    This means establishing meeting points for family members who might be split up
    — and backup points in case the first or second point also is affected by the
    disaster.'
