- en: Like many other etrading development teams, we use ION’s [MarketView](http://iontrading.com/)
    for ECN connectivity. The possibility of coding our own gateways, or switching
    to a different gateway vendor is frequently mooted. Coding our own gateways would
    mean hiring more developers, but would give us more control. It’s hard to see
    what the advantage of switching to a different gateway vendor would be, unless
    they could offer dramatically better pricing or performance. Somehow I doubt that’s
    possible. But it would be very interesting to hear from anyone with experience
    of [iCubic](http://www.icubic.com), [Last Group](http://www.lastgroup.it) or [SoftSolutions](http://www.softsolutions.it/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=60&Itemid=65&lang=EN)‘ connectivity
    products.
