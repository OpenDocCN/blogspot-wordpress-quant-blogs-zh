# Falkenblog: Peter Schiff, Prophet?

> 来源：[http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2008/12/peter-schiff-prophet.html#0001-01-01](http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2008/12/peter-schiff-prophet.html#0001-01-01)

I haven't read much by Peter Schiff, but check out these clips of him calling a bear market back in August 2006! This might be cherry picked, but unlike other permabears, he mentions the mortgage market problems with specificity, noting the weakened underwriting standards and teaser rates. I'll definitely pick up his book the next time I'm in my Barnes and Noble.
