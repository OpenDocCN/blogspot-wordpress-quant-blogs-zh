    than trend FT. While there is a lot of factor that moderate a daily MR strategy,
    one of particular interest is volatility. Usually, higher volatility is favorable
    for short-term strategies (think RSI 2). For this bit of research I tried several
    volatility formulas on several time frames and compared the effect on RSI 2 returns.

    volatility in percentile. I used three different methods to compute volatility
    figures, the classic standard deviation, the Garman Klass – Yang Zhang and the
    Yang Zhang method. The following formulas explain how I came up with the figures;
    I used the volatility function of the [TTR package](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/TTR/index.html)

    for monthly (21 days) and annual (252 days) time frames. Note that these time
    frames were arbitrarily chosen and a future post will likely expand on this with
    different time frames.

- en: At first glance, it seems that the added computation complexity does not significantly
    improve our system accuracy. On the monthly time frame though, the system average
    trade returns in the lower percentile was higher when mitigated by the YZ indicator.
    Regardless, the rest of the results were not significant enough for me to pronounce
    a volatility indicator better suited for a MR system. Traders might want to KISS
    and stay with the good old classic standard deviation.
