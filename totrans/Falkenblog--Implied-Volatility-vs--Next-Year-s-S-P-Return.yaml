    and grouped them into deciles. I then looked at the average 12 month ahead returns
    within those deciles. The results are in the graph above, and show that there
    is no clear relationship between volatility and future index returns, at least
    over the past 20 years.

    the same as expected returns, as if the failure of beta is due to a small sample
    variation in the CRSP data--an anomalous 80 year draw.'
