    economics and finance, better models for imagining and assessing risks, and so
    on. But it is true that having a better model is one thing, using it another entirely.

    do just that, to assume the role of the hero who is going to set everything right
    with a few brilliant ideas and some excellent training data.

    considerations, then I’m implicitly assuming the problem with the existing models
    is that they’re being used honestly but aren’t mathematically up to the task.

    are explained by people lying*. Before I give three examples of “big models failing
    because someone is lying” phenomenon, let me add one more important thing.

    are suggesting we do, without first addressing the lying problem, it will only
    allow people to lie even more. This is because the complexity of a model itself
    is an obstacle to understanding its results, and more complex models allow more
    manipulation.
