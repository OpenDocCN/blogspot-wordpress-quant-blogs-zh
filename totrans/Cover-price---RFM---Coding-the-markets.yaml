    from [TradeWeb](http://www.tradeweb.com) on protocols for CDS execution. From
    it you can imply the definition of “cover price”: the next best price that didn’t
    execute. As you can see in the doc, or in a TradeWeb or Bloomberg terminal, a
    client can see competitive quotes from up to 5 dealers. But while an RFQ is in
    flight, the dealers can’t see each others quotes. When the RFQ ends with an execution,
    as opposed to a client rejection, then the winning dealer gets to see the cover
    price – the price they beat. But the losing dealers don’t get to see the winning
    price, so there’s a fundamental asymmetry there.'

    I’m guessing that it’s motivated by restricting the amount of information that
    dealers have about each others pricing. Dealers are paranoid about other dealers
    figuring out their pricing. Another motivation is to keep the dealer pricing keen.
    If dealers could see each others prices, then they would slack off on aggressive
    prices, making them only just good enough to win a trade. In the face of those
    two powerful motivations, I do wonder why ECNs show the cover price to the winning
    dealer at all.

- en: The RFM model outlined in the TradeWeb doc is interesting too. The RFQ and RFS
    models operated by Bloomberg and TradeWeb for fixed income trading require the
    client to declare whether they’re buying or selling up front. RFM is a break with
    that. If it were applied to the rates markets I wonder whether it would lead to
    keener pricing or not ?
