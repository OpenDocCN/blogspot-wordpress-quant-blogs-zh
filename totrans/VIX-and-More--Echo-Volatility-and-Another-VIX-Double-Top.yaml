- en: Back in 2007, I wrote extensively about the phenomenon I dubbed [echo volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/echo%20volatility),
    in which large [VIX spikes](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20spikes)
    are frequently accompanied by a second spike of similar size in the month or so
    following the initial spike. Following the twin VIX spikes over 80 in [2008](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/2008),
    I reprised this them in a post I titled [The Significance of Double Tops in the
    VIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/12/double-tops-in-vix.html).

    like it was a VIX top of 48.00 on August 8^(th) followed by a spike to 45.28 today
    – a nine day span between VIX spikes.

- en: Of prior instances of VIX double tops, certainly the most dramatic comes from
    2008, when the VIX hit an all-time high of 89.53, pulled back more than 45 points,
    then spiked all the way back up to 81.48 some 20 trading days later. The timing
    of these VIX spikes was eerily reminiscent of the 1998 [Long-Term Capital Management](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Long%20Term%20Capital%20Management)
    fiasco, when the VIX hit 48.06 on September 11^(th), then exactly 20 days later
    hit a crisis high of 49.53.

    for a 9-day twin top going back to 2002, coinciding with the [WorldCom](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/WorldCom)
    bankruptcy filing. Here we saw a top of 48.46 on July 24^(th) and a secondary
    spike to 45.21 nine days later.

    have seen two separate spikes in which the VIX exceeded 45, with those spikes
    falling from 9 to 20 days apart.

- en: Clearly there are fundamental factors that can trigger another VIX spike above
    the 45 level before the current volatility storm has passed, but if history is
    any guide, two is likely to be the lucky number.
