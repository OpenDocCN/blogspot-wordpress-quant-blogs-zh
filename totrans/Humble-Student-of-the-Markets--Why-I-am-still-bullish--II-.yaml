    behind sentiment models is that if a certain group is in a crowded long position,

    to historical experience. Institutional fund flows into stocks have barely begun,
    which provides sustainable buying power. Individual investors have been selling
    out of equity mutual funds and funds flows barely turned positive. Are those signs
    for you to run for the hills?

    that show too many bulls in sentiment models, which are shown in red in the chart
    above, during a rally where the market advances steadily such as the QE2 stock
    market rally that began in late 2010\. At the same time, technicians could see
    a series of "good overbought conditions" as the market grinds higher.

    cap stocks. It is said that when large caps lead the market, it is a sign of faltering
    leadership, i.e. the generals are leading but the troops aren't following.

    the large cap SPY. The relative performance of small caps against large caps broke
    down in late February by violating a relative uptrend that began in October (shown
    in green) and at the same time broke down against a relative support level (shown
    in blue). Now consider the relative performance of IWM against EWI, which represents
    an equal-weighted S+P 500 and largely neutralizes the effects of Apple's rally,
    shown on the bottom panel. Note that small caps remain in a relative uptrend against
    large caps. How much of the relative breakdown is due to the capitalization effect
    of Apple?

    of the NASDAQ Composite against the NASDAQ 100\. Similarly, the small cap NASDAQ
    Composite broke down in late February against the mega-cap NASDAQ 100\. However,
    the bottom panel shows that the NASDAQ Composite remains in a relative uptrend

    may not occur. In some ways a correction is overdue because stocks have been rising
    steadily this year without a single day where the market has fallen 1%. On the
    other hand, you also have to be prepared for the possibility that there is no
    correction and the market grinds upwards while undergoing a series of "good overbought
    conditions" until individual and institutions have fully loaded up on equities.
