# Humble Student of the Markets: What's wrong with value stocks?

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2021/11/whats-wrong-with-value-stocks.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2021/11/whats-wrong-with-value-stocks.html#0001-01-01)

What's wrong with value stocks? The accompanying chart shows the relative performance of the Russell 1000 Value to Russell 1000 Growth Index ratio (bottom panel, solid line) and the closely correlated S&P 600 to NASDAQ 100 (bottom panel, dotted line). When the dot-com mania peaked in 2000, value stocks initially rocketed upward relative to growth stocks. The relative ascent began to moderate in 2001 but continued for several years.

Fast forward to 2020\. The growth style had been dominant for 5-7 years and value/growth relative performance had become extremely stretched. Value recovered in 2020 but fell back in 2021. 

History doesn't repeat, but is it even rhyming this time? What's wrong with the value style?
