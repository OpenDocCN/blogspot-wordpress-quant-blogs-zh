- en: 'is a famous conundrum in decision theory. At the Wikipedia website, they noted
    a reference to Keynes in the Ellsberg entry. As I have seen just about every idea
    attributed to Keynes, I figured this was a typical overstatement. But then I check
    the entry, and lo and behold, I think Keynes articulates the Ellsberg paradox
    pretty well. From Keynes Treatise on Probability:'

- en: The typical case, in which there may be a practical connection between weight
    and probable error, may be illustrated by the two cases following of balls drawn
    from an urn. In each case we require the probability of drawing a white ball ;
    in the first case we know that the urn contains black and white in equal proportions;
    in the second case the proportion of each colour is unknown, and each ball is
    as likely to be black as white. It is evident that in either case the probability
    of drawing a white ball is 0.5, but that the weight of the argument in favour
    of this conclusion is greater in the first case.
