    a portion of the VIX section of their web site to VIX [term structure](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/term%20structure)
    information. The CBOE’s [VIX term structure page](http://www.cboe.com/micro/vix/vixtermstructure.aspx),
    which I believe is new as of yesterday of today, uses yesterday’s data and has
    a graph of the term structure of the VIX and a table of VIX term structure data
    going out through December 2010\. In addition, there is a downloadable spreadsheet
    with historical term structure data going back to 1992.

    term structure of the VIX is an essential step in that process.
