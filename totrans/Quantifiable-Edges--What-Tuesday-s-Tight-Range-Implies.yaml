- en: I’m starting to see a number of indications that the market is ripe for a pullback.
    One indication I noticed yesterday that will often suggest a pullback was the
    extremely tight range. Tight range can be a sign of indecision. When it occurs
    with the market extended upwards it can also imply the bulls are running out of
    gas and likely to step back for at least a short time. The study below demonstrates
    this concept.

    to act on this signal and flounder  it will often do so rather quickly.
