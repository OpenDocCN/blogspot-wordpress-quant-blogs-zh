    ratio. This is a concern for some traders. As of today the 10-day put/call was
    101.3\. This is actually lower than the 200-day moving average of 101.7\. Below

- en: This first one I looked at both above and below the 200-day moving average,
    and it made little difference. The implication of the Put/Call tests seems to
    be that a relatively low Put/Call doesn’t hurt the chance of a nice bounce. This
    was a bit surprising. Also a bit encouraging.
