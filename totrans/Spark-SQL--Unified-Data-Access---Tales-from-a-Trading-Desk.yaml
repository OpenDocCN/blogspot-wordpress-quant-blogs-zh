    When married to [H2O](http://www.h2o.ai/product/sparkling-water/), it offer considerable
    power in the AI world of business transformation.  One nice feature of Spark is
    the ability to access various data sources in a consistent way – data frames/[Spark
    SQL](https://databricks.com/blog/2015/01/09/spark-sql-data-sources-api-unified-data-access-for-the-spark-platform.html).
     Amongst other data sources, [JDBC](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-programming-guide.html#data-sources)
    and Hive are supported.  A fuller list of Spark Data Source packages is available
    [here](https://spark-packages.org/?q=tags%3A%22Data%20Sources%22).  [CSV](https://spark-packages.org/package/databricks/spark-csv)
    files are even supported 🙂'

    JIRA.  JSON data files are supported by Spark, but support to retrieve JSON from
    a REST endpoint (which is probably the way to go with JIRA) doesn’t seem to be
    supported out the box.

    of Structured Data” slide 16 has an example of loading JIRA data and storing it
