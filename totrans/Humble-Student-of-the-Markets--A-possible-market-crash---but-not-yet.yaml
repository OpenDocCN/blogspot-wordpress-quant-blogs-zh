    at 9580.63, a new Dow high for the rally. On the same day the Transports closed
    at 3714.63, which was not a new high -- in so doing, the Transports failed to
    confirm the Dow. Today the Transports closed at 3806.75, a new high for the ]Transports.
    But today the Dow closed at 9547.22, below their August 27 close -- in doing so,
    the Industrials failed to confirm the Transports. This is what I call a rare "double
    non-confirmation". First, the Transports were weak in that they could not confirm
    the Industrials. Today the Industrials were weak in that they could not confirm
    the Transports. ***These rare "double non-confirmations," in the past, have tended
    to signal the top***.
