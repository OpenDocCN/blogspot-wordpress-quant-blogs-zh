    differently depending on the firm.  With the advent of multiple variations in
    tactical asset allocation and indexing strategies, it is perhaps not a stretch
    to claim that Risk Parity is as vague and elusive  as using the term “hedge fund”
    to describe a style of investment management. I have created a table below to
    clarify two different variations that are often used interchangeably and are *not*
    the same.   A good history of the origins of risk parity can be found here: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_parity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_parity).
    **Systematic Investor**– an excellent blog-  provides some useful R code and testing
    here: [http://systematicinvestor.wordpress.com/2012/03/19/backtesting-asset-allocation-portfolios/](http://systematicinvestor.wordpress.com/2012/03/19/backtesting-asset-allocation-portfolios/
    "risk parity in R"). **Meb Faber**– always a great resource for new ideas- provides
    an application of Risk Parity to asset allocation as well as a good list of articles
    here: [http://www.mebanefaber.com/2012/03/22/risk-parity-vs-endowment-model-vs-permanent-portfolio/](http://www.mebanefaber.com/2012/03/22/risk-parity-vs-endowment-model-vs-permanent-portfolio/

    of risk-budgeting schemes where the risk of each asset in the portfolio is leveraged
    (if necessary) to have the same volatility. Essentially, each asset has “equal
    risk”, and thus the portfolio is considered to be more diversified since returns
    and risk are less dependent on any one asset. In contrast, **Roncalli** [http://www.thierry-roncalli.com/riskparity.html](http://www.thierry-roncalli.com/riskparity.html
    "Roncalli")  coins the term **“Equal Risk Contribution” (ERC)**  which is a ***distinct
    sub-class of Risk Parity*** that seeks to *equalize risk contributions from each
    asset to the portfolio*. If both methods sound the same after reading various
    articles, that is because for the often cited two-asset case  they have the same
    mathematical solution and explanation for their validity. Nevertheless, not all
    Risk Parity portfolios are the same-  it is necessary to understand the differences
    between the equal risk and equal risk contribution approach to avoid improper
    application or interpretation. Below is a table that helps to define the similarities
    and differences of the two approaches and the relative advantages of each in the
    context of portfolio allocation.
