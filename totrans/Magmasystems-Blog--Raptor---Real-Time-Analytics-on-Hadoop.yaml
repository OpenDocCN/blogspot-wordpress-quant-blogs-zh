    segmentation, partitioning, bucketing, and filtering to enable ad-hoc queries
    and real-time analytics.'

- en: Raptor has intelligent optimization algorithms that switch query execution between
    HBase and MapReduce. Raptor can create per-block dynamic bloom filters for adaptive
    filtering. A policy manager allows optimized indexing and autosharding.* *This
    session will address how Raptor has been used in prototype systems in predictive
    trading, times-series analytics, smart customer care solutions, and a generalized
    analytics solution that can be hosted on the cloud.*
