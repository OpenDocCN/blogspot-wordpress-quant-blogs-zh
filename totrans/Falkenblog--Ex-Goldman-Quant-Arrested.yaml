    probable cause to a judge, but they could be a program that buys stocks based
    on the simplest of pairs trading algorithms. The problem is that intellectual
    property law in most states allows an ex-employer

    arguments(eg, ''he planned to do mean-variance optimization as he did at our firm'')
    they have the right. As an instrument of harassment this is much scarier than
    any anti-terrorist legislation, because no one cares when it is abused. The fact

    easily bankrupt a target. With such a prospect, a rich litigator can make the

    only those so insecure about how outsiders view their alpha, and how important
    non-principals are to their alpha, use this tactic gratuitiously. In the end,
    it does not work, mainly because 1) they demonstrate they believe they have little
    endogenous alpha, which is usually true and 2) no new alpha comes in, because
    those with a choice prefer to avoid such people.

    Goldman has a habit of letting ex-employees leave and prosper, as they have learned
    to use their ex-employee success to their advantage. They have no insecurity that
    people will think Goldman's alpha is from the current crop leaving to start new
    companies, as this has been going on for decades. Further, the person at issue
    is a computer programmer, not a trader or portfolio manager, and such code is
    often very specific (not broad concepts like 'variance' or 'cash flow'). Lastly,
    programmers are usually given algorithms to code; it is implausible that such
    workers already knew about parochial trading rules based on previous work automating
    account statements for Blue Cross.
