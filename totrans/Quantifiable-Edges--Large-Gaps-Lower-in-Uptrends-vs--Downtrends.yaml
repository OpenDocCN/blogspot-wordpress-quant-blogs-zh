    overnight session. As I type this around 10:30pm Eastern the S&P futures are down
    nearly 1% and the Nasdaq futures are down over 1%. Last week we saw two large
    gaps down that reversed. But do buying gaps down provide you an edge? Is it any
    different in bear markets than in bull markets?

    gapped lower by 0.75% or more 190 times. It has happened 105 times when the SPY
    was trading below its 200-day moving average and 85 times when it was trading
    above its 200-day moving average.

    that buying gaps down in uptrends is a sounder strategy than buying gaps down
    during downtrends. Prevailing wisdom is wrong.

    There would have been a net loss of about 1.7% over

- en: its 200-day moving average and gaps down by 0.75% or more showed much different
    results. In this case, 55 of 105 (52.4%) were profitable – only a slight improvement.
    But the net gain on the 105 trades was over 34.8% - a huge difference compare
    to the small loss in an uptrending market.

- en: Emotion drives markets. Large gaps down in an already fearful environment can
    provide nice buying opportunities. While the win rate is only slightly better
    than a coin flip, the potential reward far outweighs the risk and provides a quantifiable
    edge. Agile traders could also improve their risk/reward by fine tuning their
    entries and exits intraday. Bear markets are driven by fear. Gaps are frequently
    fearful overreactions. Don’t ride along with the bear.
