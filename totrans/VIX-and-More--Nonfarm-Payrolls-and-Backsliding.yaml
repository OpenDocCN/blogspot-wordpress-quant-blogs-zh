    report confirms that the job creation portion of the economy which was strong
    in March through May has turned negative again, resulting in a net loss of 125,000
    jobs in June. On the positive side, the private sector added 83,000 jobs during
    the month, while the loss of 225,000 temporary census workers was the sole reason
    for the negative headline number.

    a decline in the average hourly workweek (down 0.1 to 34.1 hours) as well as a
    decline of $0.02 in average hourly earnings to $22.53.

    and unemployment rate (red and black line) data, the chart below is intended to
    highlight the perils of overreacting to the last data point. Note that particularly
    in the early stages of a recovery (i.e., the red box covering June 2002 – August
    2003), the data tend to be choppy and any trends short-lived. I expect that the
    same dynamics are at work in the current environment. Employment is not the only
    area of concern at the moment. [Housing](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/housing)
    is also suffering from some backsliding this month, as pull forward demand triggered
    by the government tax incentives is now giving way to several months of slow residual
    demand.

    economic expansion – and the accompanying data – moving forward in a fashion that
    will probably resemble the path taken by someone trying to drive a manual transmission
    vehicle for the first time.
