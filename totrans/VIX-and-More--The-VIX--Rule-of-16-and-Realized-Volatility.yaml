    I discussed the [Rule of 16](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/rule%20of%2016)
    in terms of translating the (annualized) VIX number into expectations for future
    daily [realized volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/realized%20volatility)
    in the S&P 500 index.

- en: '*It seems that VIX is on average higher that realized volatility (based on
    daily returns over 30 days). I also tried to shift VIX 30 days in advance and
    the conclusion is the same. Since the historical ratio of the two is 1.45 (VIX/realized
    volatility), should not we infer from this past relationship that the implied
    realized volatility is more like 30 (45/1.45), meaning a 2% change 1/3 of the
    time?*'

- en: '*Over that last 20 years, I get a VIX that is about 1.40 times the SPX 20-day
    realized volatility. I attribute some of the discrepancy to the high demand for
    SPX puts as hedges, which tends to inflate the VIX relative to realized volatility
    (and immediately suggests some strategic implications vis-a-vis short SPX puts
    strategies.)'
