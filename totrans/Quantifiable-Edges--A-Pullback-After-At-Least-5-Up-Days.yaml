    pullbacks after multi-day runs higher.

- en: Initially there appears to be a moderate inclination for a move higher. Once
    you get out 9-10 days the upside edge appears solid. The idea behind this study
    is that strong moves higher tend to weaken before they roll over. The five days
    up suggest the move is strong. Since they rarely turn on a dime, this 1st dip
    is not likely the end of the up move.
