    I promised to give more detail on the [Yield Curve Bootstrapping sheet](http://54.148.111.119:8888/ycb_quandl_pub.xls/Bootstrapping)
    running on the [Amazon hosted SpreadServe instance](http://54.148.111.119:8888/dashboard.html).
    If you’d like to try running the sheet on your own desktop you can [download it
    from the repository](http://54.148.111.119:8888/repository.html); just click on
    ycb_quandl_pub.xls. To run the sheet in your own Excel you’ll need to download
    the [QuantLib](http://quantlib.org/quantlibxl/) and [SpreadServe addins](https://github.com/SpreadServe/SSAddin).
    ycb_quandl_pub.xls is based on one of QuantLibXL’s example spreadsheets, [YieldCurveBootstrapping.xls](https://github.com/arthurpham/quantlib-full/blob/master/QuantLibXL/Workbooks/StandaloneExamples/YieldCurveBootstrapping.xls),
    which gives a sample QuantLib Excel solution to a common fixed income rates maths
    problem: bootstrapping a yield curve. If you look at the original sheet you’ll
    see that all input data is present as simple cell values. To change it you must
    rekey it. Ideally this would be automated, so that deposit, futures and swap rates
    could be regularly pulled from a clean data source, and the bootstrapping results
    recalculated and published. ycb_quandl_pub.xls uses the SpreadServe Addin to pull
    the depo, futures and swap rates from quandl. Look at the top left block on the
    Quandl sheet within the ycb_quandl_pub workbook to see the invocations of the
    s2quandl function that pull the rates into the sheet from quandl.com. Lower down
    on the same sheet you can see the s2cron invocation that schedules a timer to
    go off every 5 minutes and trigger a new download of the same data. The same trigger
    is used as input to QuantLib’s qlPieceWiseYieldCurve function on the Bootstrapping
    sheet to force a recalculation when freshly downloaded data arrives. All that
    is great for automating an Excel spreadsheet. With SpreadServe we can take it
    one step further and get the sheet off the desktop and onto a server. The whole
    process is then automated, centralised and freed from possible manual disruption
    on the desktop.'

    Mon-Fri, and not Sat or Sun.
