    investments, even space aliens and hurricanes (more jobs!), but the best way to
    increase productivity is to deregulate. A lot of this overbearing regulation is
    from union-related work rules. In this Ed Prescott

    they produced iron-ore, in the process doubling their labor productivity and pushing

    rules that prevailed before the crisis. These placed restrictions on the tasks
    individuals could perform at mines, particularly repair work. First, machine operators
    were not permitted to perform even the simplest repair work on their machines.
    Second, repair staﬀ had restrictions on their work. In particular, there were
    a very large number of repair job classiﬁcations, close to thirty. A person with
    a given classiﬁcation was permitted to complete repair jobs assigned to this classiﬁcation
    but not others. In response to the crisis, work rules were changed to allow machine
    operators to conduct simple repairs and which reduced the number of repair job
    classes... a growth accounting exercise would show this growth (from changes in
    work rules) was “accounted” for by increases in total factor productivity, and
    in the capital-labor and materials-labor ratios.'
