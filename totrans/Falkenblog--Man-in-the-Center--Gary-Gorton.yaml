    their risk than they should have. He wrote a very good

    give enough information to really understand what mistakes he made, and as AIG
    failed, we can assume some were made. But Gorton is a thoughtful person, hardly
    the naive, overconfident geek so many caricature (Warren Buffet''s great quote:
    ''beware geeks bearing formulas'').'

    crisis, which involved not merely a subprime meltdown, but some sort of accelerator
    mechanism that lead to a daisy chain of financial firm failures. As the details
    of the credit default swaps are generally unobserved, it is hard to know what
    assumption were most incorrect and material.

    lead to this debacle, and I'm sure it will take a long time to sort it all out.
    After all, the take-away for a generation after the Great Depression was that
    people over speculated, and that the New Deal and then World War 2 saved the economy
    (eg, see Galbraith), and only much later did people focus on quite different factors
    as the impetus and accelerator of this crisis. In other words, financial crisis
    are almost never fully understood within a decade of their occurrence, if ever.
