Rereading Shiller's Irrational Exuberance, I found the following subchapter:

> Twelve Factors that Propelled the Market Bubbles:
> 
> 1) Capitalist Explosion
> 2) Cultural and Political changes favoring business
> 3) Information technology
> 4) Monetary policy
> 5) Baby Boom and bust
> 6) Business media
> 7) Analyst forecasts
> 8) Defined contribution retirement plans growth
> 9) Mutual fund growth
> 10) Decline in inflation
> 11) Growth in discount brokers
> 12) Rise in gambling

As the Talmud says, 'when a debater’s point is not impressive, he brings forth many arguments'. With this many causes, one wonders why bubbles happen as often as they do. I think many of these 'causes' are symptoms of the same underlying cause, or handful of causes. The essence of bubbles, as opposed to their description, is not in this book. To say this bubble was uniquely caused by these 12 factors, is journalism, because it does not generalize.
