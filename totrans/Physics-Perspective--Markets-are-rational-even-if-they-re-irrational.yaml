    hypothesis (EMH). It's a generally discredited and ill-defined idea which has
    done a great deal, in my opinion, to prevent clear thinking in finance. But I
    happened recently on a defense of the EMH by a prominent finance theorist that
    is simply a wonder to behold -- its logic a true empirical testament to the powers
    of human rationalization. It also illustrates the borderline Orwellian techniques
    to which diehard EMH-ers will resort to cling to their favourite idea.

    and time, just as behavioralists argue. But, for many reasons, as I shall argue,
    they are unlikely to aggregate up to affect market prices. It is too soon to fall
    back to what should be the last line of defense, market irrationality, to explain
    asset prices. With patience, the anomalies that appear puzzling today will either
    be shown to be empirical illusions or explained by further model generalization
    in the context of rationality.

    taking real human behaviour into account, in his view, have "too much of a flavor
    of being concocted to explain ex-post observations – much like the medievalists
    used to suppose there were a different angel providing the motive power for each
    planet." The people making a commitment to realism in their theories, in other
    words, are like the medievalists adding epicycles to epicycles. The comparison
    would seem more plausibly applied to Rubinstein's own rational approach.

    depth. Five months later, after extensive search efforts, her location within
    that circle was still undetermined. John Craven, the Navy’s top deep-water scientist,
    had all but given up. As a last gasp, he asked a group of submarine and salvage
    experts to bet on the probabilities of different scenarios that could have occurred.

    markets have made such mistaken valuations of Internet companies? It's clear that
    many people judge values at least in part by looking to see how others were valuing
