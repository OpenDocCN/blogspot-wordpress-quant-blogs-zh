    ERIC shares were equivalent in price to the SEK-listed ERIC.B shares.  Note the
    ERCB shares correspond to the right axis and trade at a roughly 50% discount to
    USD shares.  The Class A SEK-denominated ERIC.A shares trade at a discount to
    their own and USD-listed B Class equivalents.

    turbulence.  I don't like to speculate because this could have happened for any
    number of reasons (data integrity, software integrity, etc.), but judging by the

    appears to have known it was coming.
