    as the canaries in the coal mine to determine the global growth and inflationary
    expectations and therefore environment for the risk on/risk off trade. The picture
    for commodities has been indeed weak.

    assets, I would suggest that they wait for the inevitable rally and take that
    opportunity to lighten up their positions to reduce risk. Traders whose missed
    this move will likely find that it's too late to get short. I am seeing extreme
    oversold readings across the board, not just in stocks, but in my inter-market
    analysis such as the chart below of the relative returns of SPY vs IEF. If you
    get short here, you are liable to get your face ripped off in a counter-trend
    rally.
