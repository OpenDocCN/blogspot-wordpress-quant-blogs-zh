- en: Every time there is a pullback, it seems as if I receive multiple requests for
    an updated version of the table below. With the S&P 500 index reeling and still
    trying to find a bottom, this looks like a good time to put the current pullback
    in the context of the 27 most significant peak-to-trough declines from new highs
    since the SPX bottomed in March 2009.

- en: Note that the current 6.4% decline from the September 19^(th) high of 2019 is
    roughly average in terms of duration, but makes it the second largest pullback
    in percentage terms since 2012, just eclipsing the January-February 2014 pullback,
    when emerging markets ([EEM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EEM))
    and Crimea were weighing heavily on the minds of investors.

- en: Keep in mind that as ugly has things have been in the SPX, the Russell 2000
    small cap index ([RUT](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/RUT)) is down
    13.8% since topping out in early July, while the NASDAQ composite index is down
    8.5% since its mid-September top. Of course, some sectors have been hit even harder,
    with oil and gas exploration and production ([XOP](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XOP))
    down 33.3% from its 2014 high. Semiconductors ([SMH](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SMH))
    have declined 14.4% from their 2014 high, yet that high was established less than
    a month ago.

    pain to warrant a bottom, but after the events of the past week, all sorts of
    extreme scenarios now seem much more plausible.
