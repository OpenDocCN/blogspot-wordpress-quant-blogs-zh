- en: After two weeks of head fakes, the VWSI has settled back to an even zero reading,
    apparently less impressed by this week’s 16.67 high than the 17.09 peak reading
    from the previous week.

    inception](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/02/new-feature-1-vix-weekly-score.html),
    I use this indicator to [help predict](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/02/vix-weekly-sentiment-indicator-update.html)
    the price of the VIX in the coming week.  The good news is that the VWSI also
    has a solid track record of predicting the VIX 2-4 weeks out, though as with most
    crystal balls, with each week into the future it is applied, the margin of error
    increases substantially.

- en: I mention all this because in the last couple of days, I have been going back
    and forth with Adam Warner at [Daily Options Report](http://adamsoptions.blogspot.com/)
    about the likelihood of seeing a sub-10 VIX during the new options cycle that
    ends on July 20^(th).  I posted a [summary of our respective thinking](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/06/no-grunting-please.html)
    on Friday and bring it up again here because I am fairly certain that you will
    not find anyone else who is making public predictions about where the VIX will
    be 25 trading days out.  Hell, I thought I was going out on a limb just using
    the VWSI to look out 5 days…
