    increasing returns to scale is a good example of obtuse economodeling: its thesis
    was known before being the basis of the centuries-old infant industry argument,
    and after Krugman it was no easier to apply. Consider Detroit, a popular application
    for regional increasing returns when applied to autos in the early 20th century:
    what were the key conditions that allowed it enjoy increasing returns to scale
    in the early 20th century, but then decreasing returns to scale later in the century?
    He doesn''t say.'

    not a probability, and those who believe in increasing returns to scale invariably
    are more inclined to believe in selective tariffs, that is, they don't use Krugman's
    model to support free trade but rather increased protection. So, it hasn't changed
    the debate and is counter to his assertion that his New Trade Theory is "probably
    the main story" in import-export arguments for decreasing trade restrictions;
    his new model has not changed the debate at all, merely added another obscure
    reference to the confabulators. Increasing returns to scale remains 1) a fringe
    argument and 2) used primarily to support trade restrictions, as it was in the
    1900s before Krugman's New Trade Theory model.

    the greatest lies we tell are the ones we tell ourselves, because he clearly has
    the capacity to see slight inconsistencies and flaws in others (he's a meticulous
    advocate against his opponents).

    see correlations (planes and cargo) and suppose the essence of something is one
    of those correlations (eg, build models of planes, and cargo will show up). Thus,
    just as naive people think the essence of a good poem is rhyming, naive economists
    think that setting up a hypothesis as if one were deriving the Dirac equation
    or special relativity seems like the essence of a science. Unfortunately, economic
    equations rarely work out that way.

    the Drake equation can have any value from a hundred billion to zero. An expression
    that can imply anything implies nothing. I mean, this formulation is worthy of
    writing down, but it's very different than the Dirac equation or Newton's laws,
    even though at some level there's a similarity.
