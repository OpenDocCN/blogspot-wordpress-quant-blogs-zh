- en: . I think it's the most convincing book I've read so far that links the mechanisms
    of the recent crisis to crises in the past. In effect, he argues that the crisis
    was the direct result of the uncontrolled creation of money by the shadow banking
    sector, and ultimately took place as a classic bank run, no different from runs
    in the past, except that this run took place mostly out of public view because
    it didn't involve ordinary bank deposits. The new kind of money in this bank run
    was stuff such as repo agreements and commercial paper which played the role of
    money for financial institutions. In 2007-2008, when lenders lost confidence (for
    good reason) in the mortgage-backed collateral backing this money, they demanded
    that money back, and the financial system seized up.

    because Gorton does a masterful job of placing this bank run in the context of
    the long history of past runs. And also because Gorton, as an economist, places
    blame squarely on the economics profession (himself included) for being asleep
    at the wheel:'

    prior to the financial crisis. What did they see? They did not see the possibility
    of a systemic crisis. Nor did they see how capital markets and the banking system
    had evolved in the last thirty years. They did not know of the existence of new
    financial instruments or the size of certain money markets. They did not know
    what "money" had become. They looked from a certain point of view, from a certain
    paradigm, and missed everything that was important... The blindness is astounding.
    That economists did not think such a crisis could happen in the United States
    was an intellectual failure.

    have noticed, in talking about the ideas in this book with my economist colleagues,
    that there is a fairly clear generational divide on this. To younger economists
    and graduate students, it is obvious that there was an intellectual failure. Some
    older economists are inclined to hem and haw, resorting to farfetched rebuttals.
    It is clear that this is a sensitive issue, as like banks no one wants to have
    to write down the value of their capital.

    nineteen-seventies, we were sitting in the Ph.D. oral examination of a Chicago
    economist who has gone on to make his mark in the world. His thesis was on rational
    expectations. After he’d left, Friedman turned to me and said, “Look, I think
    it is a good idea, but these guys have taken it way too far.”

    in theory. But the fact is, it didn’t have any empirical content. When Tom Sargent,
    Lard Hansen, and others tried to test it using cross equation restrictions, and
    so on, the data rejected the theories. There were a certain section of people
    that really got carried away. It became quite stifling.

    and on Wall Street. Economists in those areas relied on Keynesian models to make
    short-run forecasts. It seemed strange to me that they would continue to do this
    if it had been theoretically proven that these models didn’t work.

    confronting it with data—that is still very much alive. It might be in the study
    of wage inequality, or labor supply responses to taxes, or whatever. And the idea
    that people respond rationally to incentives is also still central. Nothing has
    invalidated that—on the contrary.

    The basis of the rocket is still intact. It is what I see as the booster stage—the
    rational-expectation hypothesis and the vulgar versions of the efficient-markets
    hypothesis that have run into trouble. They have taken a beating—no doubt about
    that. I think that what happened is that people got too far away from the data,
    and confronting ideas with data. That part of the Chicago tradition was neglected,
    and it was a strong part of the tradition.

    devoted to the Friedman legacy. I was talking about the permanent income hypothesis;
    Lucas was talking about rational expectations. We have some bright alums. One
    woman got up and said, “Look at the evidence on 401k plans and how people misuse
    them, or don’t use them. Are you really saying that people look ahead and plan
    ahead rationally?” And Lucas said, “Yes, that’s what the theory of rational expectations
    says, and that’s part of Friedman’s legacy.” I said, “No, it isn’t. He was much
    more empirically minded than that.” People took one part of his legacy and forgot
    the rest. They moved too far away from the data.

    Lucas asserts (around 19:40) that debt just doesn't matter because the level of
    debt and credit always "cancels out." He seems to think it is strange that anyone
    could even think that debt should matter, as if he's completely blind to the massive
    agony and social upheaval ensuing from foreclosures and failed businesses around
    the US and the world. Lars suggests this is "unbelievable stupidity" and it is
    certainly unbelievable, but I think maybe it is less stupidity and reflects more
    a kind of borderline autistic inability to make a distinction between some extremely
    abstract mathematical model and actual economic reality. In Lucas's models, I
    suspect that debt and credit do always cancel out. Which is one aspect of what
    makes those models quite useless for many purposes, and dangerous in the hands
    of anyone who takes them too seriously.
