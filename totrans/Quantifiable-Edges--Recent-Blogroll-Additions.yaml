- en: While I have made some recent additions to the blogroll, I have neglected to
    mention them on the blog.  So I thought I would do so quickly, since they all
    deserve to be pointed out.

- en: This is a fairly new site, but they have put together a nice list of quant-oriented
    blogs.  Several can be found on my blogroll, but there were a few that I had never
    even heard of.  So I have some more exploring to do with some of these.

    runs the only football “quant” site I know.  He doesn’t just argue about who’s
    better.  He builds entire stats-based cases.  Right up my alley.
