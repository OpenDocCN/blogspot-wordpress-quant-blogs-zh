## Back to VS 2008 Beta 2, Silverlight and More

I was hoping this [link](http://blogs.msdn.com/astebner/archive/2007/08/24/4548657.aspx) from a colleague would helped me recover my machine back to VS 2008 beta 2.  Unfortunately the re-install failed, and after 2 hours of trying various things, I decided to re-install the OS and start again 😦  Not impressed.

[SilverlightCream](http://www.silverlightcream.com/) has a number of interesting articles in the 1.1 space.  Anyone got an idea of the timeframe for the next 1.1 drop from Microsoft?
