    Let’s call it Glass-Steagall 3.0\. I start with the old Canadian model, where
    financial institutions were broken up into four distinct categories: banking,
    trust, insurance and investment banking and companies that were in one business
    were not allowed to be any other. This effectively breaks up large financial conglomerates
    and reduces their size and therefore their TBTF risk. If you agree with Paul Volcker’s
    contention that the [greatest financial innovation has been the ATM](http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/banking_and_finance/article6949387.ece),
    then breaking up financial conglomerates should not reduce value because of the
    removal of “synergy”.'

    bank](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2009/01/proposal-for-reforming-wall-street.html),
    or at very least, do not allow investment banks to be publicly traded. If an investment
    bank were to be a privately owned limited liability corporation, most of the personal
    net worth of management is likely tied up in the illiquid shares of the company.
    Such an arrangement focuses the mind on risk management, not short-term profits.

    other hand, if investment banks had greater risk controls in place, the size of
    the mortgage market wouldn’t have gotten to the size that it did. Consequently,
    the size of the AIG book wouldn’t have grown to the gargantuan size that it did
    and the spillover effect into the investment banking system could have been contained.

    smaller financial institutions to compete effectively. Stanley Hartt, who was
    Canada’s Deputy Finance Minister (the most senior bureaucrat in the “apolitical”
    civil service), [commented](http://www.irpp.org/po/archive/sep05/hartt.pdf) that
    Canada dismantled the four pillars approach to financial regulation because it
    found that there were a number of small regional bank failures because they were
    too small and had an overly undiversified asset base to compete effectively.
