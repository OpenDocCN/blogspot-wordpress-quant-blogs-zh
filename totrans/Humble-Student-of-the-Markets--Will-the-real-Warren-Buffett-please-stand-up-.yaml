- en: When the crisis struck, I felt you would understand the role you had to play.
    But you’ve never been known for speed, and in a meltdown minutes matter. I worried
    whether the barrage of shattering surprises would disorient you. You would have
    to improvise solutions on the run, stretch legal boundaries and avoid slowdowns,

    must end the rise in the debt-to-G.D.P. ratio and keep our growth in obligations
