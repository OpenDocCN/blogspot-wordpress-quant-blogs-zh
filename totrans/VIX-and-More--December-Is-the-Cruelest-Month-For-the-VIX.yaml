    in the CBOE Market Volatility Index (the formal name of the VIX, for those who
    may have a short memory) that leave investors scratching their heads. In light
    of this, it appears I will be responsible for at least one December post reminding
    investors about the idiosyncrasies of implied volatility and the VIX during the
    holiday season.

- en: There are a number of ways to look at the typical holiday swoon in the VIX,
    which I have labeled (the [holiday effect](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Holiday%20Effect)
    or [calendar reversion](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/calendar%20reversion))
    for easy tagging and backtracking. From a strict fundamental perspective, the
    biggest change during the December/January holidays is fewer trading days, which
    means a shorter runway for stocks to depart for some unusual destinations. The
    other big factor is one of [seasonality](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/seasonality),
    specifically the tendency for December to be a bullish month for stocks.

    they sometimes leave on the charts in posts from previous years (see links below.)

- en: This year I am offering a chart which shows that in any given year, there is
    about a 40% chance that the VIX will make its annual low in December and as I
    discussed last year in [VIX and the Week Before Christmas](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/12/vix-and-second-half-of-december.html),
    the bottom usually comes in the last half of the month and most often just before
    Christmas.

- en: In three trading sessions the VIX is already more than 20% off of its 30.91
    close from last Thursday. It seems rather far-fetched to think that the VIX will
    plummet all the way below the current 2011 low reading of 14.27 from April 28^(th)
    of this year (a date that is provisionally included in the chart below,) but stranger
    things have happened.

    will see several more eruptions before the end of the year, don’t be surprised
    if the VIX is sleeping with the fishes for the next week or two.
