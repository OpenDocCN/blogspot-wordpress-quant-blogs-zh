    then group the daily changes by their calendar month, giving me 12 groups. The
    ANOVA analysis tells me if the groups (months) have significantly different averages.
    If so, I know the spread is seasonal since it is consistently up in certain months
    and consistently down in others.

    seasonal spreads. A recent scan identified the spread between crude oil (CL) and
    gasoline (RB), for example. The initial ANOVA analysis indicated the CL/RB spread
    is very likely to be seasonal. This bar chart of each month's average daily change
    demonstrates the seasonality. (Click on the graph to enlarge it.)

    May and June are definitely "up" months because their confidence interval is entirely
    positive (above the axis). Likewise, November and December are definitely "down"
    months. For all other months, we cannot be certain because the confidence interval
    crosses zero, so the true average change could be either negative or positive.
    The conclusion: Be long the spread during May and June; be short during November
    and December.'
