- en: Ever since the bear market of 2000-2003 found a bottom and started up, equities
    and commodities have largely been moving up together.  That relationship came
    to an end when the equity markets topped in mid-October.  Since then, as the first
    chart below indicates, the SPX has been falling while the [Reuters/Jefferies CRB
    Index](http://www.jefferies.com/cositemgr.pl/html/ProductsServices/SalesTrading/Commodities/ReutersJefferiesCRB/index.shtml)
    of commodities has been on the rise.  While the direction of these indices has
    recently changed, the inverse relationship appears to be holding up.  The SPX
    and CRB chart below shows that commodities turned down about two weeks ago, just
    before the equity market bottomed.

    started getting out of equities last August and September as the market topped,
    concerns were raised about the credit markets, and the Fed started cutting rates.  The
    Fed’s actions clearly caused many investors to be more concerned about inflation
    and pushed them in the direction of assets – such as commodities – that have historically
    performed well in an inflationary environment.

    six month heat map, courtesy of [FINVIZ.com](http://finviz.com/index.ashx), which
    shows in dramatic fashion, that commodities have been one of the few areas of
    strong performance during the past six months.

- en: As financial firms de-leverage, it is possible that speculative bets will be
    limited to equities or commodities, but not both, so it is important to watch
    which asset class is soaking up most of the money currently on the sidelines.  I
    will update this story as it unfolds.
