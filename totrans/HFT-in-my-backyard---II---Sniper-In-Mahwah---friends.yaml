    neither used nor owned by NATO; rather the tower was built by and for the US Army
    in the 1970s. The tower (and two others located in Belgium, one of which is also
    now used by Jump) was [sold](http://www.defense.gov/Releases/Release.aspx?ReleaseID=9245) to
    Belgium in 2006\. “The Department of Defense announces today the decision to inactivate
    and return three microwave radio relay sites to Belgium. (…) Closure of these
    sites will result in an estimated annual savings of over $84,000 based on a comparison
    of the current annual operations and maintenance costs to an annual replacement
    commercial communications cost,” wrote the US Department of Defense. In 2012,
    the Belgium Ministry of Finance used the same money-saving rationale to auction
    the tower.

    my request for his phone number was refused by the Services Patrimoniaux office,
    I did speak with someone who attended the auction. Only eight people attended:
    the auctioneer, his assistant, a government official, and five potential buyers
    – two or three Americans including a Jump representative, one large Belgian law
    firm probably acting on behalf of a competitor and a single observer. Prior, the
    prospective buyers had all visited the Houtem tower in situ so they entered the
    auction knowing the tower was in poor shape and required renovations my informant
    estimated would cost the winner $1,000,000\. The starting price was €255,000 and
    the Belgium government would have been very happy with €400,000\. The first tick-size
    was a €5,000 increment, but after half an hour the price was at €700,000 and the
    tick-size was increased to €10,000 accordingly.'

    interest in a lousy old tower; this unexpectedly high price left him perspiring
    nervously and calling for a break. Collecting himself in the bathroom, he exhaled
    quietly, bewildered, “What the hell…” The auction resumed, bids climbing to €1,000,000,
    €1,500,000, €2,000,000\. At this point the auctioneer asked for another pause.
    Finally, after three and a half hours, the tower was sold for €5,000,000\. One
    attendee quickly left, as his car was parked in front of a police station and
    the meter was long expired. Another losing bidder approached Jump to ask, “Can’t
    we arrange?” meaning their company would purchase bandwidth or rent some dish
    space on Houtem tower. I wish I had been a fly on the wall to confirm my suspicions
    about which competitor attempted to make arrangements with Jump at the auction
    deep in Flanders that day.

    parking my car far from a tower, taking binoculars and a camera, checking the
    GPS of my mobile and then walking – one is obliged to walk far, as most of the
    towers are in potato fields. Several expeditions to different towers gave me the
    practice to perfect my technique before I was confident to approach the object
    of my visit. At Houtem, I parked near a farm and walked along the Chemin des Limites
    road near the Belgium-France border. Nearing the site, I noted a van and a workman
    in the tower’s basement. “Not good news,” I told myself, thinking an intelligence
    officer should always remain unseen. I began to surreptitiously photograph the
    Houtem tower:'

    lines. Depending on atmospheric conditions they bend more or less and mostly downward.
    This generally extends the reach of towers beyond the straightforward result that
    [Euclidian geometry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon) would yield. Jump’s
    tower provides only a very limited advantage because the extra distance is proportional
    to the square root of its height whereas it’s price is more than linear in height.

    people started a fire which caused severe damage to the tower – this [video](http://www.rtbf.be/video/detail_pylone-rtbf-de-wavre-incendie-vers-quelles-solutions?id=1930036) coverage
    in French actually shows Jump dishes in a shot. The tower is property of the Belgium
    national TV/radio operator RTBF but also supports many dishes used by mobile operators.
    The fire received such media attention because May 24 was an important election
    day in Belgium, and the police wondered whether the fire was related to the election.
    RTBF quickly erected a temporary tower to install mobile, TV and radio dishes,
    but the Jump dishes stayed on the tall tower because the 50 meter temporary one
    wasn’t high enough.

    tower may not have been asking to install dishes on the tower; rather his proposal
    might have been to share bandwidth. Despite the small world of financial microwave
    networks being as silent as the potato fields in which stand their towers, I have
    discovered that Jump is sharing its network with [Perseus](http://perseustelecom.com/perseus-to-address-trading-and-microwave-technology-at-hifreq-trade-2013/) and
    another data provider I’m not at liberty to name. The facts are as follows:'

    these links takes 6 microseconds and change to serialize.

    a somewhat likely scenario due to the likelihood of one customer sending data
    nano or microseconds before the next customer and so on. In this thought experiment,
    Customer 1 is first, taking 6 microseconds to serialize into the 100Mbps microwave
    link. Customer 2 sends their trade data 2 microseconds later, so they wait 4 microseconds
    to serialize and another 6 to actually serialize. Customer 3 sends trade data
    1 microsecond after Customer 2, waiting 3 microseconds for Customer 1, then 6
    microseconds for Customer 2, then 6 more microseconds to actually serialize. Customer
    4 is quicker; they send their data 1 nanosecond after Customer 3\. And wait 2.999
    microseconds for Customer 1, then another 6 for Customer 2, then another for Customer
    3, then another 6 microseconds to actually serialize.

    in a shared bandwidth agreement. Jump shares its bandwidth with Perseus. While
    Perseus has additional customers, none will be as fast as Jump. This doesn’t mean
    Jump is the fastest operator in the HFT world, however. Despite purchasing a tall
    tower in a strategic place, they still aren’t as quick as contenders like….well,
    I’ll detail the fastest of the HFT competitors in Part III.
