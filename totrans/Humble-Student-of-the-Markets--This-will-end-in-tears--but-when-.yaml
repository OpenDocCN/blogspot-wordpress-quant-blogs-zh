    less and ultimately contract more than YoY. Retail sales minus PCE's are always
    negative BEFORE the economy ever tips into recession. That's 11 of 11 times. Further,
    in 10 of those 11 times (1957 being the noteworthy exception), the number was
    not just negative, but was continuing to decline for a significant period before
    we tipped into recession. ***This makes perfect sense, as retail sales generally
    include many far more discretionary purchases. As the economy accelerates, consumers
    make more discretionary purchases. As it slows, the more discretionary retail
    purchases are the first things cut.***

    lead time from the time this signal was triggered to the start of the recession
