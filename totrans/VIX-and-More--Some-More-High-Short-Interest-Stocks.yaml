    highlighted seven stocks and two ETFs which had extremely high [short interest](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/short%20interest)
    back in early March 2009\. Not surprisingly, these stocks have done very well
    as the market and the economy have turned around.

    portfolio using current data a shopping list for bulls or for bears?

- en: Looking at the list below (which includes companies with 30% of the float short,
    average volumes of at least one million shares per day, as well as additional
    filters for optionability, minimum market cap, price, etc.), which I assembled
    after yesterday's close, there is a strong representation of recent high fliers
    ([TLB](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TLB), [SKS](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SKS))
    in addition to several stocks that have been underperforming as of late ([GDP](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/GDP),
    [STEC](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/STEC), [FSYS](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/FSYS)).
    Given my bias for shorting weakness rather than strength, I will be looking most
    closely at the latter group as possible short candidates, while keeping an eye
    on retailers such as Talbots and Saks as possible buy on the dip candidates until
    there is better evidence that the consumer – and retail stocks – are suffering
    from fatigue.
