    a half-baked plan, only to be followed by a crisis later. The next EU summit occurs
    on December 9 in Marseilles and the world will be watching to see what kind of
    solutions the eurocrats have cooked up next.

    in these circumstances. Take steps to stabilize him ("inject liquidity via the
    ECB") and then address the causes with a program of diet, exercise and medical
    treatment ("longer term solutions such as balanced budgets, pro-growth policies,
    possibly closer fiscal integration, two-speed eurozone, etc."). Berating him about
    being lazy and overeating ("you lazy Greeks, Italians...") and making him get
    on the treadmill to work off his Thanksgiving feast ("more austerity and IMF monitors")
    while he is on the verge of a heart attack ("Lehman like financial crisis") is
    less than helpful under the circumstances.

    European institutions working alongside the bank. It seeks, for example, bulletproof
    fiscal constraints on euro area members (something more credible than the Stability
    Growth Pact, which was widely ignored). It also wants a common euro area crisis
    fund to relieve the bank of the primary bailout responsibility. In addition, the
    ECB wants individual member states to accelerate structural reforms in their national
    economies.

    the eurozone and devalue its new currency.
