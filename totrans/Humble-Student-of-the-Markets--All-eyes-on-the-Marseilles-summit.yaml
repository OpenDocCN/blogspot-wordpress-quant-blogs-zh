    a half-baked plan, only to be followed by a crisis later. The next EU summit occurs
    on December 9 in Marseilles and the world will be watching to see what kind of
    solutions the eurocrats have cooked up next.

    being lazy and overeating ("you lazy Greeks, Italians...") and making him get
