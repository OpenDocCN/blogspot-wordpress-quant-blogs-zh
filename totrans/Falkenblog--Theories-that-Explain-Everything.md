Stephen Hawking has a new book out, and he gives his great credibility to "M-Theory", which is another name for the 11-dimensional string theory. But

Yeah, I'd say that sounds like a bad thing. Many think they have cast off the shackles of superstition and now come to their thoughts through rational, objective science (aka, positivism). Yet, many of those same people believe ideas based on their potential to either explain everything or generate the kind of future they like.

Anyway, it is interesting that many people think understanding the origin or end of the universe is important for humans to know. I have my doubts.
