- en: I generally use the VIX as a speculative vehicle rather than a [hedging](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/hedging)
    tool, but lately I have received several questions about how one might go about
    hedging a portfolio with the VIX. The subject of hedging is going to require a
    series of posts in order to do it justice, but before I dive in, I thought I should
    share an interesting paper from Edward Szado that recently became available on
    the web site of the Center for International Securities and Derivatives Markets
    ([CISDM](http://cisdm.som.umass.edu/index.asp)) at the University of Massachusetts.

- en: In Szado’s own words, his paper “assesses the impact of a long VIX investment
    as a diversifier for a typical institutional investment portfolio during the 2008
    credit crisis. The analysis covers the period of March 2006 to December 2008 (beginning
    shortly after the introduction of [VIX options](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20options)
    in February of 2006) with a focus on the latter part of 2008 (from August to the
    end of December).”

    strategies.

- en: '*“Ultimately, the goal of this study is not to make a strategy recommendation
    for an ongoing risk management program, but rather to consider the impact that
    a long VIX exposure would have had in this particular time period. The increased
    correlations among diverse asset classes in the latter half of 2008 generated
    significant losses for many investors who had previously considered themselves
    well diversified. It is clear from the results of the analysis that, while long
    volatility exposure may result in negative returns in the long term, it may provide
    significant protection in downturns. In particular, investable VIX products could
    have been used to provide some much needed diversification during the crisis of
    2008\. In addition, the results of this study suggest that, dollar-for-dollar,
    VIX calls could have provided a more efficient means of diversification than provided
    by SPX puts.”*'

    study and offer some of my thoughts about using various VIX products for the purpose
    of hedging.
