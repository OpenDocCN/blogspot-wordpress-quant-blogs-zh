    stage model](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/trader%20development%20stage%20model),
    which I rolled out last Tuesday in a post with the unlikely title of [Draft Trader
    Development Stage Model](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/09/draft-trader-stage-development-model.html)
    and put immediately to work in an option context in [The Trader Development Stage
    Model and the Jump from Stocks to Options](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/09/trader-stage-development-model-and-jump.html).
    Clearly this framework resonated with quite a few traders, from beginner to advanced.

    might be helpful to expand upon the simplified version of the original trader
    stage development model and introduce a second version.

    Management*) to the original stage development model, but also adds some explanatory
    notes, labels for clarification (*Issues*, *Theme* and *Unit of Focus*) and further
    identifies each of the three stages with what I call *Unit of Focus*, but can
    also be interpreted as a Level of Abstraction or something similar.

    adding interpretive commentary other than to note that the two-way arrows represent
    tension between issues that are closely linked, sometimes because they compete
    with each other and other times because they are complementary. Also, while I
    never spelled it out the last time around, the background colors are meant to
    represent when the trader is likely losing money, breaking even and finally making
    a profit.

    more specific with it, use it as a diagnostic, etc. For now, the current level
    of detail is probably appropriate for most future applications I anticipate in
    this space.

    to any feedback, criticisms, suggested enhancements, etc.
