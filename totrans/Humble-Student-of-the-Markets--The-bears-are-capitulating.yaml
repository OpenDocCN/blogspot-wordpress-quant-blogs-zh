    risk and price momentum, the investment professional is forced to make a decision
    based on what he believes the dominant investment regime will be in order to minimize
    career and business risk. This amounts to the classic Keynesian investing beauty
    contest, where investors do not try to determine the winner based on some investment

    also the latest BoA Global Fund Manager Survey shows signs of capitulation by
    cautious bears. Even though a record net 78% of survey respondents acknowledged
    that equities are overvalued, which is the highest reading since the survey began

    survey.
