    activities perforce are highly influenced by government behavior. Thus, it may
    seem priggish to think that big companies should be totally outside of politics,
    and simply react to the environment. Successful large companies may have to play
    the game, in the same way politicians have to mouth cliches, and promise generally
    unrealistic objectives.

    general commonweal. Fine. They are still pandering pond scum. Not that nationalizing
    large private companies is better: I''d rather have a scheming FedEx lobbyist
    than a scheming US Postal Service exec driving policy. Our political process creates
    too much power in Washington, and everyone who focuses there is either is a sell-out
    or an empty suit. That this must be so given our political system, which has arisen

    (unlike Mr. Utkus's) is not ideological, it's transactional. For example, the
    PAC gave $30,000 in this cycle to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee
    and $30,000 to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee — and it also gave
    $30,000 this cycle to the National Republican Congressional Committee and the
    National Republican Senatorial Committee.
