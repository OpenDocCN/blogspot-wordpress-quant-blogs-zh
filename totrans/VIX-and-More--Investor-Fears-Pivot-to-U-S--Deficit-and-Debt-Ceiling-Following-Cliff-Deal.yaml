    the U.S. deficit and [debt ceiling](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/debt%20ceiling)

- en: The two issues that dominated the fear poll during the last quarter seem to
    have receded from the consciousness of most investors. While the legacy of the
    fiscal cliff lives on in the debt ceiling discussions, the immediate threat has
    passed. Meanwhile, in spite of warnings from the likes of Angela Merkel, concerns
    related to the [European sovereign debt crisis](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/European%20sovereign%20debt%20crisis)
    remain at low levels and continue to decline.

- en: On the institutional front, one of the residual effects of the fiscal cliff
    is a persistent worry that the fiscal cliff is merely a symptom of a dysfunctional
    bi-partisan government with a newfound affection for brinksmanship. On the other
    hand, worries about excessive central bank intervention are falling, no doubt
    helped in that regard by the recent [FOMC](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/FOMC)
    [minutes](http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/fomcminutes20121212.pdf)

- en: With the VIX posting a record one-week decline last week, it is reasonable to
    conclude that investor worries about the fiscal cliff were of a much higher magnitude
    than those related to the U.S. debt ceiling and deficit. In fact, there are some
    divergent opinions about the relationship between the declining VIX and the fiscal
    cliff deal. For more on this subject, check out the comments from Jared Woodard
    of [Condor Options](http://condoroptions.com/) in [The Market Is As Nervous as
    Ever About Austerity Fetishisms](http://condoroptions.com/2013/01/07/the-market-is-as-nervous-as-ever-about-austerity-fetishism/),
    in which Jared picks up on a theme from a recent note by Alec Phillips of Goldman
    Sachs ([GS](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/GS)).
