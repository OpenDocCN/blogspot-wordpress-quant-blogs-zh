    in [TVIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TVIX) is has spiked to 13.5%
    above its [intraday indicative value](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/intraday%20indicative%20value).

- en: At this juncture, longs are likely betting that the prospect of a short squeeze,
    perhaps in combination with a VIX spike, could land them some significant windfall
    profits. Shorts, on the other hand, are assuming that it is just a matter of time
    before Credit Suisse ([CS](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/CS)) reopens
    the creation units window for TVIX, which should restore the supply-demand equilibrium
    and dissolve the 13% premium in the form of a different type of windfall profit.

    to note them in the disclosure section below, but suffice it to say that as the
    TVIX premium increases, I find it increasingly difficult to make the bull case
    in terms of anticipating an additional expansion of that premium.]*'
