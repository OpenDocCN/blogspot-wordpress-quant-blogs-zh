    and see the wide divergence of views over the macro outlook, and this is coming
    from 17 of the nation’s top policymakers who also ostensibly keep in touch with
    each other. The range on 2010 GDP estimates is: 2.0% to 4.0%; for 2010, 2.5% to
    4.6% for 2011, and 2.8% to 5.0% for 2012\. These two percentage points are huge
    for a $14 trillion economy — we’re talking about differences that amount to $300
    billion! The range on the unemployment rate forecast for 2010 is 8.6% to 10.2%;
    for 2011 it is 7.2% to 8.7%; and for 2012, the band is 6.1% to 7.6%. These ranges
    are massive. And, for the inflation rate, the range for 2010 is 1.1% to 2.0%;
    0.6% to 2.4% for 2011, and for 2012, the range is 0.2% to 2.3%.'

    a return to full employment by 2012; and another that sees the prospect of deflation.
    These views are worlds apart and attest to our assertion that the band around
    any particular forecast in a post-bubble credit collapse is huge.
