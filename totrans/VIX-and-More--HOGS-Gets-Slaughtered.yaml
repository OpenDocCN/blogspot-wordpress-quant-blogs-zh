    but based on everything I have heard, there is no evidence to support that swine
    flu can be transmitted through the consumption of pork products. Still, investors
    did not let this fact stand in the way of selling Zhongpin ([HOGS](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/HOGS)),
    the $231 million (market cap) Chinese producer of pork and pork products. HOGS
    fell 6.2% yesterday on the second highest volume session since last July in what
    was clearly a case of guilt by association.

    courtesy of [WhatsTrading.com](http://whatstrading.com/), shows that while options
    activity spiked dramatically, most of the action was in calls, which was running
    at about twice the rate of put volume yesterday. Also, implied volatility (not
    shown) more than doubled.

- en: Obviously there is a great deal of uncertainty surrounding swine flu – and a
    fair amount of misinformation being circulated. There is no doubt that eating
    pork products is unrelated to the spread of swine flu, but that does not necessarily
    mean that pork products and stocks such as Zhongpin will be shunned and suffer
    real declines.
