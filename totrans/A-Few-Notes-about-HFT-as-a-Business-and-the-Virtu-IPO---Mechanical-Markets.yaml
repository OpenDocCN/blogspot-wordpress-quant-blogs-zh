    there will be two HFTs on the public market. From my own experience, otherwise
    sophisticated people can get overexuberant about the business prospects of HFT.
    Here, I’ll try to give a bit of detail on some business risks that I think are
    often neglected. In addition to this blog’s normal [disclaimer](https://mechanicalmarkets.wordpress.com/about/),
    I’m emphasizing that nothing in this post constitutes advice to buy, sell, not
    buy, or not sell a security or any financial instrument.

    This can be true even in the face of [market inefficiencies](https://mechanicalmarkets.wordpress.com/2015/01/13/trader-type-and-order-age/)
    that easily lend themselves to profitable [trading strategies](https://mechanicalmarkets.wordpress.com/2015/01/20/identifying-trader-type-pt-2/).
    I don’t have any specific knowledge of Virtu. But, in addition to the commonly
    cited risks like the Knight debacle or regulatory changes, there are obstacles
    to long-term success that are (I think) universal sources of anxiety.

- en: The intellectual property of HFTs, by its very nature, devalues rapidly. One
    way HFTs create strategies is by analyzing patterns in market data. Over time,
    current strategies may leave detectable signatures that competitors can integrate
    into their own strategies, reducing profitability. Perhaps more importantly, the
    ultimate sources of trading revenue, an HFT’s counterparties (or counterparties
    of counterparties, etc) may adapt to the trading strategies, eliminating their
    edge. Both of these effects are fundamental to the operation of markets. One way
    to look at trading is that it consists of pouring information into the public
    domain in exchange for money. Eventually, you have dumped enough information into
    the market that your information source (in this case, your algorithm) is no longer
    of any value.

    were it not for the mobility and negotiating power of employees. Clever, experienced
    employees are a rare resource and it takes many years for an investment in the
    next generation of talent to bear fruit. Virtu has ample resources (and public
    image) to compete for promising newcomers, but my feeling is that their current
    employee-related costs are lower than the competition. That could continue, but
    I think that there are strong forces that would bring it more in line with industry
    norms. Many commentators view the financial sector as a sort of worker’s paradise.
    I would argue that HFT is an extreme example of that; the loss or gain of just
    a few key employees could determine the fate of a company. A bank could potentially
    stomach even 100% turnover over a short period and still retain *some* value.
    I don’t think you could say the same for an algorithmic trading company, and the
    employees know it.

    in their careers. It would not surprise me if Virtu aggressively increases compensation
    in order to retain them.[[1](#bottom)] The alternative may be that they go on
    a hiring binge with new recruits taking years to reach the productivity level
    of their current crew. The latter option involves letting some of the more expensive
    employees go to competitors, which may also increase the speed at which their
    current IP devalues. Even with non-competes and trade-secret covenants, experienced
    employees who leave undoubtedly take valuable intuition with them.[[2](#bottom)]

    businesses. There is discussion of opening up stodgy trading activities that are
    currently restricted to banks (e.g. [swaps](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-06-06/citadel-builds-swaps-unit-to-repeat-market-making-triumph),
    [spot fx](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-04-02/high-frequency-traders-chase-currencies-as-stock-volume-recedes),
    bonds/credit, MBS, insurance). If HFTs are able to get access to some of the core
    revenue drivers for banks, they may attain rapid increases in profitability, at
    least until competition starts to compress their margins again. This is, after
    all, the original story of HFT (and more broadly, “Financial Tech”): highly profitable
    but uncompetitive industries become electronic and open to new entrants, which
    can capture market share astonishingly quickly.'

    will be the ones to capitalize on it. I obviously don’t know the answer to that,
    but it’s worth remembering that many HFTs are less than a decade old. Unlike other
    businesses, they have no customers and no brand loyalty. Their employees are savvy
    and often have savings sufficient to forgo a salary for an extended period. From
    my perspective, frontier markets offer plenty of opportunity to new firms. That
    is, if the markets aren’t just opened to those with large legal teams and a capacity
    to eat massive entry fees. Which, in my mind, is the upside potential here; If
    Virtu is able to gain access where others cannot, their profits could well expand
    many times over.

    value of a company years down the road. A big question is whether Virtu will survive
    long enough for investors to make their money back.[[3](#bottom)] My guess is
    that Virtu’s current IP will be largely worthless in about 5 years. So really
    what an investor is betting on is Virtu’s management and its ability to cheaply
    retain, recruit, and produce effective employees. With Virtu seeking a valuation
    of about 2.6B on net income of about 190M, at their current rate they will need
    to go for about 13 years before paying back their investors. In HFT, that’s an
    absolute eternity.

    of automation and efficiency into their business. This would allow them to offer
    competitive compensation to their employees, while still generating higher profits.
    If that’s the case, it seems like just a matter of time before other HFTs realize
    similar efficiencies and begin to poach employees, putting upward pressure on
    compensation.'
