    business cycles (Japan had a massive new fiscal stimulus package every two or
    three years from 1990 to 2005, and it did not work). But in any case, the logic
    of the government multiplier is rather straightforward partial equilibrium economics.
    It basically says, since people spend 60% of what they make, when the government
    spends $1, it actually creates $2.5 via the iteration of following that dollar
    through the economy (1+0.6+0.6^2+0.6^3+...). Thus, government spending basically
    pays for itself, because if you tax $2.5 by 40%, you get your initial dollar back!'

    were fully employed at the job of their choosing, which means never in real time
    (though economists look back wistfully at the 1960's and 1940's). An economic
    solution without a trade-off is surely too good to be true, and it was, as economies
    in the West all broke the bank in the 1960's and 1970's, and it just resulted
    in high amounts of debt, inflation, and lower productivity growth.

    demand, as opposed to the new theory, which is that government spending, properly
    managed, can keep an economy at “full employment.” So what has demand management
    wrought? Inflationary spirals and their inevitable cataclysms, a rationale for
    greater government spending, and a general waste of time looking at business cycles
    at the expense of growth theory. To Keynes, entrepreneurship and wealth creation
    were descriptions of any investment process whether managed by a politburo, a
    despot, or an energetic profit maximizer. Nancy Pelosi, Bill Gates--what's the
    difference? Clever, yes. Wise, no.

    wording about 'euthanizing the rentier' (this when Kulaks in Russia were being
    really euthanized), it was great because it created macroeconomics as we know
    it, and so could 'handle' the Great Depression. I think prior depressions, and
    regular recessions, were handled much better pre-1936 than post.

    For some reason, really smart mathematicians are highly susceptible to those who
    seem intelligent but show no doubt, as if they reverse reason that the only way
    someone as smart as X could believe Y with such certainty, is that Y is true!
    Much of what we are taught as the high intellectual history of the social sciences
    is based more on the magnetism and impenetrable self-assurance of thinkers than
    on minor issues like whether they were right or not.
