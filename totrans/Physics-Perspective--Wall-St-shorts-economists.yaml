    economy, i.e. for gaining insights which can be had in no other way, no one on
    Wall St. actually seems to use them. Good question, I think:'

    investors immediately dumped the stock of manufacturer Morton Thiokol Inc., which
    made the O-rings that were eventually blamed for the disaster. With extraordinary
    wisdom, the global market had quickly rendered a verdict on what happened and
    why.

    sources, do a wonderful job of valuing companies, ideas and inventions. So what
    does the market think about economic theory itself? The answer ought to be rather
    disconcerting.

    equilibrium” models that encapsulate the dominant thinking about how the economy
    works. The result? Some do pay a little attention, because they want to predict
    the actions of central banks that use the models. In their investing, however,
    very few Wall Street firms find the DSGE models useful.

    Can an economy of hundreds of millions of individuals and tens of thousands of
    different firms be distilled into just one household and one firm, which rationally
    optimize their risk-adjusted discounted expected returns over an infinite future?
    There is no empirical support for the idea. Indeed, research

    two possibilities. Maybe they do capture some deep understanding about how the
    economy works, an “if, then” relationship so hard to grasp that the world’s financial
    firms with their smart people and vast resources haven’t yet been able to figure
    out how to profit from it. I suppose that is conceivable.

    in telling nice stories that fit with established traditions and fulfill the crucial
    goal of getting their work published in leading academic journals. With mathematical
    rigor, the models ensure that the stories follow certain cherished rules. Individual
    behavior, for example, must be the result of optimizing calculation, and all events
    must eventually converge toward a benign equilibrium in which all markets clear.

    small edge over others in identifying emerging weather patterns. Their models
    help them make good profits in the commodities markets. If economists’ DSGE models
    offered any insight into how economies work, they would be used in the same way.
    That they are not speaks volumes.

    the smart people with “skin in the game.” I wouldn’t bet on it.
