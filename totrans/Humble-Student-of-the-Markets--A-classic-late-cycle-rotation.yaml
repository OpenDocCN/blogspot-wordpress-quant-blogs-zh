- en: Years ago, one of the first things that I learned when I ventured into technical
    analysis was sector and industry rotation. Technical (which are not necessarily
    economic) bull phases start with leadership from interest sensitive groups, such
    as banks and homebuilders. The leadership baton is then passed to consumer related
    sectors, capital goods and so on. The terminal phase is signaled by the leadership
    of deep cyclical resource sectors.

    are rolling over. The chart below shows the market relative returns of the homebuilding
    ETF (XHB), which is in a relative downtrend after breaking key relative technical
    support levels.

    equities and commodity and commodity related plays. The chart below shows the
    SPX (in black) and the CRB Index (in red) for the last three years. For the first
    couple of years, the two more or less moved in tandem, but a divergence was much
    in evidence in 2013 as stocks went north and commodities went south, mostly because
    of angst over China.

    not everyone believes the official statistics) and commodity prices appear to
    have bottomed and they are starting to rally. Meanwhile, the equity uptrend remains
    intact.

    and it would spark an oversold rally. That's what's happening now. Here is the
    relative performance of the metals and mining sector (XME) relative to the market.
    XME has rallied through a relative downtrend and there may be further relative
    upside. I have outlined the Fibonacci retracement levels as likely upside targets.
    Even the lower 38.2% Fibo level shows considerable potential upside from current
    levels.

    to the market and the site of the relative downtrend line approximately coincides
    with the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level from the previous shorter term chart.

    Last week, it tested the 50 day moving average, which is considered by many technicians
    to be an important support level. Given what I am seeing in the change in sector
    and industry leadership, I believe that we are seeing a late market cycle rotation
    into the deep cyclicals and the bull may have one last gasp upward.
