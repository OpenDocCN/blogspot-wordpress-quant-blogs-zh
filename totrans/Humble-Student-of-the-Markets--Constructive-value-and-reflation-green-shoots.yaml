    to spot changes in macro conditions. My models are seeing some early green shoots
    in the value and reflation trade. It began with the stronger than expected July
    Jobs Report. The subsequent tame core CPI print also helped to reinforce the narrative
    of non-inflationary growth. As a consequence. the value/growth ratio is turning
    up after exhibiting a positive RSI divergence and relative internals improved.
    The Russell 1000 Value Index even rallied to a fresh all-time high.
