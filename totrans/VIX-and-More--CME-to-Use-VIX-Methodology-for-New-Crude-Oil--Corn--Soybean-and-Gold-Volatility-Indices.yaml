    they are collaborating with the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) to bring
    to market four new volatility indices which are scheduled to be launched in the
    third quarter of 2010.

    Executive Vice President Richard G. DuFour [noted](http://www.cboe.com/aboutcboe/ShowDocument.aspx?DIR=ACNews&FILE=03_05_2010_1.ascx&CreateDate=05.03.2010&Title=CBOE+GRANTS+LICENSE+FOR+VOLATILITY+INDEXES+TO+CME+GROUP),
    “VIX has become the accepted standard for measuring market volatility, and the
    new products that will result from this agreement illustrate the broad utility
    of this methodology.”

    excited by the prospect of volatility indices being extended to the CME and commodities.
    Of course the CBOE has already rolled out two commodity-related volatility indices
    with the CBOE Crude Oil Volatility Index, also known as the “Oil VIX” ([OVX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/OVX))
    and the CBOE Gold Volatility Index, also known as the “Gold VIX” ([GVX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/GVZ)).
    Should the joint CME/CBOE volatility indices gain broad acceptance, I would not
    be surprised to see additional commodity-related volatility indices to follow.
