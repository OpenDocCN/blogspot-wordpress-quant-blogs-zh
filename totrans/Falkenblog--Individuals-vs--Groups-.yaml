    one field is fertilized differently. True enough. But Bloom then says, because
    this is true, one can't say anything about groups of individuals. This simply
    isn't true, as the same reasoning can be applied to individuals, even more so.
    Further, one can do studies that abstract from important omitted variables, by
    in effect controlling for things like fertilizer, just as one does when estimating
    the effect of a characteristic for an individual.

- en: Think of a stock. It has characteristics like its industry group, beta, and
    P/E ratio. These characteristics are important because they have different implications
    for risk and, sometimes, expected returns. When analyzing a large portfolio, this
    way of slicing things is informative. However, when looking at a specific stock
    to buy, the more you analyze the particulars of a stock like GOOG, these broad
    characteristics become merely one datum among many, almost irrelevant. Basically,
    factor analysis explains a lot only when applied to groups, not single stocks,
    for which the error is sufficiently large as to not make it a very meaningful
    bit of information compared to a narrative of GOOG's business strategy and stock
    performance against its peers. In contrast, most econometric financial research
    involves grouping stocks into deciles, sorted by a variable of interest.
