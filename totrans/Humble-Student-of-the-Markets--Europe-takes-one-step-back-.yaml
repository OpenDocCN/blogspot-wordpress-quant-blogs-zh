    of some kind during 2012, possibly by losing access to market funding on affordable
    terms, but more likely by the ECB making a programme for the Spanish sovereign
    a condition for continued willingness to fund the Spanish banks, which are currently
    the main buyers of newly issued Spanish sovereign debt. The existing and likely
    near future EFSF/ESM and IMF financial facilities are unlikely to be sufficient
    to both fund the Spanish sovereign fully and leave enough financial ammunition
    in reserve to deal with possible sovereign financial emergencies in Italy or in
    the ‘soft-core’ of the euro area. The Spanish sovereign would therefore likely
    continue to fund itself at least partly in the markets even if it comes under
    a programme. To ensure market access by the Spanish sovereign, the same combination
    of cheap ECB funding for periphery banks and financial repression of periphery
    banks by their national authorities that has been effective in lowering sovereign
    yields since the first LTRO is likely to be required.

    legislation. Among these were labour market reforms aimed at reducing severance
    pay in the long-term contract sector (while introducing or raising it in the flexible
    contract sector); reforms aimed at reducing the scope and incidence of industry-wide
    collective bargaining and replacing it with something closer to firm-level or
    establishment-level contracting; the imposition of an additional €50bn provisioning
    requirement on the banks; and laws aimed at strengthening central government control
    over the finances of the lower-tier authorities (autonomous regions and municipalities).

    we know from the Greek experience. In addition, both structural reform and a medium-term
    programme of fiscal austerity based on a politically acceptable formula for fiscal
    burden sharing look necessary to restore Spain to fiscal sustainability. The new
    government’s decision to wait 100 days to introduce its first budget, in the pursuit
    of electoral gain, did little to boost Spain’s standing in global markets.

    In the meantime, there is doubt from the markets that they can implement them

    legislation will get watered down, but I believe that the pendulum is swinging
