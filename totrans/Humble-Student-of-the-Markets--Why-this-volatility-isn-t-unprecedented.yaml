    an unprecedented event. Recall the NASDAQ top of 2000\. The NASDAQ 100 fell -39.8%
    from its March 2000 high, and rebounded 40.1% to its 61.8% Fibonacci retracement
    level in just four months. The index proceeded to lose -49.7% in that year, and
    ultimately -80.8% at the 2002 bottom, all from the July reaction high.

    to today's action. Barring some other unforeseen catastrophe, such as the Big
    One taking down California and decimating Silicon Valley, the market is not going
    to fall -80% from the reaction high.
