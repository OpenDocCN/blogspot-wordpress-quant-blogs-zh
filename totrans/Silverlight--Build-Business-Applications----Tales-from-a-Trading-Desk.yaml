    deploy them like an Internet application, and take advantage of the power of .NET?
    Learn about an exciting new technology that is all about making business applications
    for RIA (Rich Internet Applications) much easier to build. In this session, you‚Äôll
    hear how we‚Äôve made n-tier application development as simple as traditional 2-tier,
    provided application level solutions to developers, and how we‚Äôre doing all of
    this with the same.NET platform and tools on both the client and on the server.
