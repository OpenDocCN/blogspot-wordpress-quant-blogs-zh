    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    market. The latest results from the BoAML Fund Manager Survey show that 59% of
    institutional managers believed that we are in the late-cycle phase of the expansion
    cycle. The 59% figure is the highest reading since August 2008.

    rising wage and other inflationary pressures, which are ultimately followed by
    tight monetary policy.

- en: The current macro environment is indeed seeing signs of tighter employment and
    modest inflationary pressures. A couple of months ago, the markets had been wrongly
    focused on the risks of impending recession. We are now seeing a reversal and
    a FOMO (fear of missing out) reflationary rally in stock and commodity prices.
