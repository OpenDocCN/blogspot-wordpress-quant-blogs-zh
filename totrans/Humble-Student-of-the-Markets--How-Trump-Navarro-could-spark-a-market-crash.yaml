    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    signal. A bullish Trend Model signal that gets less bullish is a trading "sell"
    signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading
    "buy" signal. The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of
    the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. Past trading of
    the trading model has shown turnover rates of about 200% per month.

    trade flows from a Chinese hard landing would first tank the Asian economies,
    followed by Europe, whose banking system are still over-levered and have not fully
    recovered from the Great Financial Crisis. Under such circumstances, an equity
    bear market would be a 100% certainty, and a market crash would be within the
    realm of possibility.

    scenario. However, we should get better clarity as the Trump team moves into the
    West Wing of the White House in the coming weeks. In addition, President-Elect
    Trump may give us some clues on trade when he holds his press conference on Wednesday.
