## Tibco (StreamBase) and Software AG (Apama)¬†Thoughts

Wall Street & Technology offers a [view](http://www.wallstreetandtech.com/it-infrastructure/whats-behind-the-cep-buying-spree/240156739) on the recent CEP buying spree.¬† My view is that from a financial services perspective, having low latency messaging bus that connects active [in-memory](http://www.benstopford.com/data-grids-with-oracle-coherence-an-introduciton/) data nodes is the first cornerstone for a real-time big data [risks](http://www.gigaspaces.com/content/massively-scalable-real-time-risk-analysis-webinar) analysis platform ‚Äì data messaging fabric üôÇ¬† Mix in a distributed Complex Event Processing (CEP) component that offer both pre-define, and dynamic aggregation and computation of data for both real-time and bi-temporal data sets.

Clearly this product will need a super cool User Interface (UI), which leads to Bret Victor ([as](http://www.righto.com/2011/12/javascript-secrets-of-worrydreamcom.html) blogged [previous](https://github.com/worrydream/Tangle)), and Tangle, which would allow this [super](http://danielhooper.tumblr.com/post/19313911658/codebook) [cool](http://danielchasehooper.github.io/CodeBook/) UI to interact with the dynamic event processing server side component, [varying](http://livecoding.io/) the inputs that form the basis for the data presented.
