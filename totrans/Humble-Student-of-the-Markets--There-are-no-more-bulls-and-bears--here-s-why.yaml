- en: Analysts who try to call the direction of the US equity market are facing an
    especially difficult time as they are encountering a bewildering array of both
    bullish and bearish sentiment readings. That's because the stock market has bifurcated
    into a growth stock market and a value stock market. There is no more single stock
    market anymore.

- en: This chart of the Russell 1000 Value to Russell 1000 Growth ratio tells the
    story. After value stocks opened a "Vaccine Monday" runaway gap last November,
    value stocks have made their way higher against growth stocks. The ratio became
    extended and exhibited a negative 5-day RSI divergence in early January. Both
    value and growth stocks proceeded to pull back, with value the underperformer.
    The ratio exhibited another negative RSI divergence in early March. This time,
    growth stocks rallied with a vengeance while value stocks were mostly flat. The
    Russell 1000 Growth Index skidded but recovered and its advance is currently testing
    technical resistance defined by the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level.

  zh: 这幅 Russell 1000 价值股与 Russell 1000 成长股比率的图表讲述了故事。在价值股在11月最后一个交易日开盘时出现了“疫苗周一”的失控缺口后，价值股相对于成长股一路走高。这个比率变得过于扩张，并在1月初显示出负的5天RSI背离。价值和成长股都回调了，价值股表现较差。比率在3月初再次显示出负的RSI背离。这次，成长股猛烈反弹，而价值股大多表现平淡。Russell
    1000 成长指数滑落但恢复，其涨势目前正考验由61.8%斐波那契回撤水平定义的技术阻力位。
- en: This account of internal rotation underscores my point that this is a tale of
    two markets. Indeed, it was the best of times and the worst of time for growth
    and value. There are no more bulls and bears. You can be a value bull and growth
    bear, or a growth bull and value bear.

  zh: 这段内部轮动的描述强调了我的观点，这是两个市场的故事。的确，对增长和价值来说，这是最好的时代和最坏的时代。再也没有牛市和熊市了。你可以是价值牛市和成长熊市，或者是成长牛市和价值熊市。
