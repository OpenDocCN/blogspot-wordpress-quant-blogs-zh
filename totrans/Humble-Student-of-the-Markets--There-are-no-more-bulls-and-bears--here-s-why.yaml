    market diary and shrugged. The S&P 500 closed only +0.3% on the day. Beneath the
    surface, however, a lot has been going on in the past few weeks.'

    especially difficult time as they are encountering a bewildering array of both
    bullish and bearish sentiment readings. That's because the stock market has bifurcated
    into a growth stock market and a value stock market. There is no more single stock
    market anymore.

    story. After value stocks opened a "Vaccine Monday" runaway gap last November,
    value stocks have made their way higher against growth stocks. The ratio became
    extended and exhibited a negative 5-day RSI divergence in early January. Both
    value and growth stocks proceeded to pull back, with value the underperformer.
    The ratio exhibited another negative RSI divergence in early March. This time,
    growth stocks rallied with a vengeance while value stocks were mostly flat. The
    Russell 1000 Growth Index skidded but recovered and its advance is currently testing
    technical resistance defined by the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level.

    two markets. Indeed, it was the best of times and the worst of time for growth
    and value. There are no more bulls and bears. You can be a value bull and growth
    bear, or a growth bull and value bear.
