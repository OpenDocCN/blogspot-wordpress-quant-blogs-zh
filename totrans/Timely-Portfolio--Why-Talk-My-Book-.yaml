    explores the outperformance of ideas posted on the Value Investors Club site. 
    I enjoyed this article more for the exploration and summary of research on their
    “Talk Your Book (TYB)” model than the analysis of outperformance.  The discussion
    of TYB gives me a good chance to explore the reasons I blog or talk my book, which
    is not the same as their model suggests:'

    a fund manager who, on the basis of her private information, identifies a stock
    that is selling for 50% of its intrinsic value. The manager will deploy her capital
    to the fullest extent possible, stopping only when her capital base is exhausted
    or she reaches a mandated portfolio position

    exerted by the manager herself, the stock may remain considerably undervalued.
    Because the fund manager has no further ability to increase the size of her position,
    she faces limited costs in sharing her information. She therefore shares her private
    information with other arbitrageurs in her social network. These other arbitrageurs
    verify the private information and, by deploying capital of their own, ultimately
    drive the price of the asset closer to intrinsic value.

    increases in value, the arbitrageurs who receive the shared information obtain
    access to a profitable trading opportunity, and prices slowly approach intrinsic
    value. In the end, prices reach intrinsic value, but market efficiency is a multi-stage
    process because information must travel through a social network before it is
    fully reflected in asset prices.'

    Only the established trend of the market can attract enough attention to move
    the market meaningfully in my favor.  Markets are not efficient, and I have no
    private information.  I simply need to be an diligent, honest, and humble observer
    of the market, and I will do well.
