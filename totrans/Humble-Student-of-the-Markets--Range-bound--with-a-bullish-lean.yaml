    in Japan in late June. A high level of uncertainty is the order of the day, with
    short-term direction will be determined by the latest news or tweet.

    and 2895-2900 on the upside. From a technical perspective, direction cannot be
    determined until either an upside or downside breakout is achieved.

    and shoulders formation, with a measured target of 2980 on an upside breakout.
    As good technicians know, head and shoulders formations are not complete until
    the neckline breaks. The current pattern can only be interpreted as a setup that
    may fail.

    any hint on likely direction. However, the market is giving a number of bullish
    clues from a technical perspective.
