- en: What's the most important thing to worry about in Europe - or with the economic
    crisis more generally? I think for many people -- especially economists of the
    Chicago school -- the biggest concern is that we might lose a couple of percentage
    points of cherished growth over the next ten years, leading to a tragic loss of
    GDP relative to where we might have been. But the really important thing about
    this crisis isn't about money or wealth, but about social stability. George Soros,
    as usual,

  zh: 在欧洲——或者更普遍地说，在经济危机中——最应该担心的是什么？我认为对很多人来说——尤其是芝加哥学派的经济学家——最大的担忧是我们可能会在未来十年失去几个百分点的宝贵增长，从而导致相对于我们可能达到的GDP水平的悲剧性损失。但这次危机的真正重要之处不在于金钱或财富，而在于社会稳定性。乔治·索罗斯，像往常一样，

  zh: 比其他人更清晰：
- en: 'I have been very concerned about Europe. The euro is in the process of destroying
    the European Union. To some extent, this has already happened, in the sense that
    the EU was meant to be a voluntary association of equal states. The crisis has
    turned it into something that is radically different: a relationship between creditors
    and debtors. And, in a financial crisis, the creditors are in charge. It is no
    longer a relationship between equals. The fate of Italy, for example, is no longer
    determined by Italian politics – which is in a crisis of its own, I would say
    – but rather by the creditor/debtor relationship. That is really what dictates
    policies.'

  zh: 我对欧洲非常担忧。欧元正在摧毁欧洲联盟。在某种程度上，这已经发生了，意思是欧盟本应是自愿平等国家的协会。危机使它变成了完全不同的事物：债权人与债务人之间的关系。而在金融危机中，债权人掌控着局面。这不再是由平等国家组成的伙伴关系。例如，意大利的命运不再由意大利政治决定——我会说是意大利政治正处于危机中——而是由债权/债务关系决定。这才是真正决定政策的因素。
- en: The point is that this European crisis is NOT JUST a financial crisis. It is
    much more serious than that. It's a political and social crisis. We talk about
    it in financial terms, but the really important thing is a massive breakdown in
    cooperation and political function, obviously in Europe, but elsewhere as well.
    A few years ago, the idea of a global financial crisis seemed pretty hard to imagine.
    What are we failing to imagine now?

  zh: 问题是，这场欧洲危机不仅仅是金融危机。它比那更严重。它是一场政治和社会危机。我们用金融术语来谈论它，但真正重要的是合作和政治功能的巨大崩溃，显然是在欧洲，但其他地方也是如此。几年前，全球金融危机的想法似乎相当难以想象。我们现在忽略了什么？

  zh: 乔治·索罗斯也对紧缩政策有几点看法：
- en: The evidence is growing that austerity is not working. Sooner or later, I expect
    a reversal of the current fiscal policy – the sooner, the better. There is a political
    problem, namely that the creditors dictate economic policy. And there is a financial
    or an economic problem, namely that the policy the creditors advocate is counter-productive.
    The rest of the world, in the face of excessive unemployment, is no longer trying
    to reduce prematurely government debt accumulated during the financial crisis.
    And the rest of the world engages in quantitative easing. The latest convert is
    Japan, where the central bank has been forced to abandon its orthodox monetary
    policy. So I think it is only a matter of time. Something has to give in Europe,
    because Europe is out of touch, out of synch, with the rest of the world.

  zh: 越来越多的证据表明紧缩政策不起作用。迟早，我期待着当前财政政策的逆转——越早越好。一个问题在于，债权人制定经济政策。另一个问题是，债权人所倡导的政策具有破坏性。面对过度失业，世界上其他地区不再试图过早减少在金融危机期间积累的政府债务。世界上其他地区正在进行量化宽松。最新的转变是日本，那里的中央银行被迫放弃了正统的货币政策。所以我认为这只是时间问题。在欧洲，必须有让步的地方，因为欧洲与世界其他地区脱节、不同步。
