    crisis more generally? I think for many people -- especially economists of the
    Chicago school -- the biggest concern is that we might lose a couple of percentage
    points of cherished growth over the next ten years, leading to a tragic loss of
    GDP relative to where we might have been. But the really important thing about
    this crisis isn't about money or wealth, but about social stability. George Soros,
    as usual,

    the European Union. To some extent, this has already happened, in the sense that
    the EU was meant to be a voluntary association of equal states. The crisis has
    turned it into something that is radically different: a relationship between creditors
    and debtors. And, in a financial crisis, the creditors are in charge. It is no
    longer a relationship between equals. The fate of Italy, for example, is no longer
    determined by Italian politics – which is in a crisis of its own, I would say
    – but rather by the creditor/debtor relationship. That is really what dictates
    policies.'

    much more serious than that. It's a political and social crisis. We talk about
    it in financial terms, but the really important thing is a massive breakdown in
    cooperation and political function, obviously in Europe, but elsewhere as well.
    A few years ago, the idea of a global financial crisis seemed pretty hard to imagine.
    What are we failing to imagine now?

- en: The evidence is growing that austerity is not working. Sooner or later, I expect
    a reversal of the current fiscal policy – the sooner, the better. There is a political
    problem, namely that the creditors dictate economic policy. And there is a financial
    or an economic problem, namely that the policy the creditors advocate is counter-productive.
    The rest of the world, in the face of excessive unemployment, is no longer trying
    to reduce prematurely government debt accumulated during the financial crisis.
    And the rest of the world engages in quantitative easing. The latest convert is
    Japan, where the central bank has been forced to abandon its orthodox monetary
    policy. So I think it is only a matter of time. Something has to give in Europe,
    because Europe is out of touch, out of synch, with the rest of the world.
