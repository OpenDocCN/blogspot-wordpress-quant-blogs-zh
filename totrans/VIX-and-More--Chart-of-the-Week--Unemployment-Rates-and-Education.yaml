- en: While I have a bias in favor of using home grown charts for my [chart of the
    week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week), this
    week one chart in particular stuck in my head, the chart below from [EconomPic
    Data](http://econompicdata.blogspot.com/) that compares recent changes in the
    relative level of unemployment to the overall [unemployment rate](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/unemployment%20rate).

  zh: 虽然我偏爱使用自制的图表作为我的[本周图表](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week)，但本周
    particularly 吸引我注意的是一张来自[EconomPic Data](http://econompicdata.blogspot.com/)的图表，它比较了近期失业率的相对水平与总体[失业率](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/unemployment%20rate)的变化。
- en: It may take a moment for readers to get their bearings on this graph, but in
    essence it shows that one’s level of education has increasingly become a factor
    in the likelihood of being unemployed. A decade or so ago, the unemployment rate
    for someone with less than a high school degree (dark blue line) was about 2%
    higher than the average for the population, while the unemployment rate for those
    with a bachelor’s degree or higher was about 2% lower than the average for all
    workers. By 2009, the gap had tripled to the point that less than a high school
    degree translated into a 6% higher unemployment rate and at the same time a bachelor’s
    degree or higher now meant about a 6% lower unemployment rate.

  zh: 读者可能需要一点时间来熟悉这个图表，但本质上它显示了教育水平在失业可能性中日益成为一个因素。大约十年前，高中以下学历者的失业率（深蓝色线）比人口平均失业率高约2%，而拥有学士学位或更高学历者的失业率比所有工人的平均失业率低约2%。到了2009年，这一差距扩大到三倍，这意味着高中以下学历者的失业率比平均失业率高6%，同时，拥有学士学位或更高学历者现在的失业率比所有工人的平均失业率低约6%。
- en: Not surprisingly, data shows that educational levels are highly correlated to
    income levels and rates of unemployment. While these facts should not come as
    a surprise to anyone, they certainly explain some of the recent income inequality
    data and should also have interesting political, social and other repercussions
    going forward.

  zh: 不出所料，数据显示教育水平与收入水平和失业率高度相关。虽然这些事实对任何人来说都不应该感到惊讶，但它们确实解释了一些最近的收入不平等数据，并可能对未来产生有趣的政治、社会和其他影响。
