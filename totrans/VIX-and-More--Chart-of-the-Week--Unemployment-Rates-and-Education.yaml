    week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week), this
    week one chart in particular stuck in my head, the chart below from [EconomPic
    Data](http://econompicdata.blogspot.com/) that compares recent changes in the
    relative level of unemployment to the overall [unemployment rate](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/unemployment%20rate).

    essence it shows that one’s level of education has increasingly become a factor
    in the likelihood of being unemployed. A decade or so ago, the unemployment rate
    for someone with less than a high school degree (dark blue line) was about 2%
    higher than the average for the population, while the unemployment rate for those
    with a bachelor’s degree or higher was about 2% lower than the average for all
    workers. By 2009, the gap had tripled to the point that less than a high school
    degree translated into a 6% higher unemployment rate and at the same time a bachelor’s
    degree or higher now meant about a 6% lower unemployment rate.

    income levels and rates of unemployment. While these facts should not come as
    a surprise to anyone, they certainly explain some of the recent income inequality
    data and should also have interesting political, social and other repercussions
    going forward.
