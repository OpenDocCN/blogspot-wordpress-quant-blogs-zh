- en: I watch a lot of amateur wrestling, coaching my kids and all, and there's always
    a handful of girls in these events in grade school. Usually, they are the sisters
    of wrestling brothers, and the dad was a wrestler. Some are really good, but then
    puberty hits, and the boys separate, and there is perhaps one female wrestler
    among every 20 teams.

    sport. So when looking for wrestling, I was surprised to see so much women's wrestling.
    I guess if I want my daughter to make the Olympics, this is probably one of the
    easier paths, just because there are so few competitors.

    the college level means you bested many many other girls. That should be a varsity
    sport. Sure, it's not competitive like football, but it is competitive nonetheless,
    and given the interest of the girls, I think saying you were a cheerleader at
    a division 1 school is more impressive than saying you played softball or lacrosse.
    Plus, it would alleviate a lot of Title IX problems that are decimating wrestling
    programs in college.
