    of red in global stocks, notably in [emerging markets](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/emerging%20markets),
    where the popular [EEM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EEM) emerging
    markets ETF is down close to 1% as I type this and the [Brazil](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Brazil)
    ([EWZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EWZ)) is down more than 2%.

    emerging market country ETFs: Brazil (EWZ); [Russia](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Russia)

    ([FXI](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/FXI)). While all four country
    ETFs have declined between 8% and 20% during the past six weeks, the various woes
    afflicting each country appear to be country-specific to a large extent, though
    obviously the issues affecting China’s manufacturing base and export market have
    a significant upstream impact on Brazil.'

    in Brazil, India and China have helped to fuel a global selloff.
