    does not mean the “HFT in the Banana Land” series is finished. Quite the contrary:
    what was dubbed “[The Case of the Small English Town vs The Large HFT Tower](http://blog.themistrading.com/2016/02/the-case-of-the-small-english-town-vs-the-large-hft/)”
    by Themis should be renamed “The Case of the Small English Town vs The **Two**
    Large HFT Tower**s**” as there is now a fierce battle between Vigilant Global/DRW
    and New Line Networks (KCG/Jump) in Richborough, each firm seeking to build a
    300-meter mast in the same area, as close as one kilometer apart – a third (and concerned)
    party recently [said](http://www.mckay-brothers.com/exchanges-vs-networks/) in
    Chicago: “*It’s crazy*”. What was going on the last weeks around the Banana Land
    (and in Belgium) is captivating; a lot has happened and it’s hard to summarize,
    but I’ll try to make a not-too-long and clear summary on the current situation

    Connect) having a network between London and Frankufrt have to deal with at least
    two different locations in London (LHC and Interxion aside): Basildon (where the
    ICE/NYSE/Euronext exchange is located) and Slough (the Equinix LD4 where the matching engine
    of, for instance, BATS (ex-)Chi-X, is located). In the London metro area waves
    are not micro (MW) but millimeter (MMW). MMW are faster than MW but they are not
    good for long distance transmissions due to higher signal loss, so a path between
    two points is several kilometers only (compared to a 100-kilometer path you can
    get with MW). That means there are *a lot* of MMW dishes between Slough and Basildon.
    And that means every location is important if you need, let’s say, to build a
    mast. According to the McKay Brothers [website](http://www.quincy-data.com/product-page/),
    it takes less than *one millisecond* for a MMW signal to travel between the two
    data centres (273 microseconds exactly). Every microsecond counts.'

    \ and this part is interesting: “*The Equinix worldwide network of data centres\
    \ and international business exchanges are currently connected by fibre optic\
    \ cables. However within the UK in recent years, metal and cable theft has extended\
    \ to almost epidemic levels. In the last couple of years, this has become one\
    \ of the fastest growing national menaces with the Home Secretary and HM Treasury\
    \ estimating the annual cost to industry to be in the region of £1bn for just\
    \ the replacement of the metal/cable. These numerous fibre cuts have caused both\
    \ Equinix and its customers, particularly in the UK \Lfinancial services sector,\
    \ a significant reduction in speed of service which, considering the UK as one\
    \ of the most globalized economies in the world and The City of London as one\
    \ of the world’s three command centres of the global economy, is unacceptable.\
    \ Indeed with financial services contributing such a large proportion of the UK’s\
    \ GDP, any slow down or potential disruption to service is of national importance.\
    \ Consequently many of Equinix’s customers are now implementing a wireless network\
    \ to avoid any such outages and the subsequent loss of important services and\
    \ reduction to GDP*.” If I understand correctly, the high-frequency traders decided\
    \ to use wireless networks because some villain cable thieves reduced UK’s gross\
    \ domestic product… Good story."

    TTX – TTX Trading LLP, an English company [dissolved](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/OC366902/filing-history)

    Whatever. Note that this table, dated 2013, does not include other familiar names/operators/firms
    such as McKay Brothers, Optiver or Tixos. Tixos is an interesting case. They play
    the Slough-Basildon route only, they don’t have the full London-Frankfurt network,
    so my suspicion was: Tixos is more interested by equities than derivatives. Tixos
    was the only network I could not identify when I started to figure out who were
    the very low-latency actors sending waves above our heads. Tixos did not seem
    to be a trading firm nor a publicized micro/milli/waves provider. I suspected Tixos
    to be a private wireless provider working for a single market maker/high-frequency
    trader (and I was right). But the [public data](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/08659771/filing-history) about
    this UK company does not mention names related to trading. Since *tixos* means
    “wall” in Greek, I thought the firm behind Tixos was from *Wall* Street (and I
    was wrong). I asked around to my industry contacts, some of them knew the answer
    but didn’t want to tell me (that’s the usual and fun game between them and me:
    I have to find information myself ;). At some point I got a lead from London saying
    “Look at the [Modern Markets guys](http://modernmarketsinitiative.org/about/about-modern-markets-initiative/)”.

    to build a 35-meter mast (15 meters higher than the Jump one) on the Basildon
    Rugby Football Club ground. The name of this competitor? Vigilant Global. What is
    happening in Richborough nowadays is only a sequel of what happened in Basildon
    before – but with higher towers. Vigilant stated in the document that “*with this
    site, Vigilant Global is committed to contribute to the community through its
    compensation of the local Rugby Club*… *should this application be rejected, the
    negative impact on Vigilant Global’s financial returns would have a similar impact
    on the local community through a trickledown effect*… *there is an existing 20
    metre lattice tower of a similar nature to this proposal sited approximately 300
    metres north of the site within the grounds of the Selex Sports and Leisure Club” – *hello
    Jump – but Vigilant added that the Jump mast was an “*unsuitable structure for
    the proposal as it is too low, therefore, the required line-of-sight for the network
    path will not be achievable*” (note that Vigilant never writes the unsuitable
    mast is owned by a competitor – discretion is advised). With this new 35-meter
    mast in Basildon, Vigilant is getting closer to the perfect straight line between
    Basildon and Slough. Nice done.

    firms find some better locations/paths. But the 300-meter masts Jump/NLN and Vigilant
    seek to build around the Banana Land will be there to stay (at least for 25 years).
