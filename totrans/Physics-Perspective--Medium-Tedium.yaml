    silly business of posting two paragraphs and then linking to "more at Medium."
    It's a good question, so let me explain what's going on. I know it's irritating,
    and I'd like not to do it, but ....

    writers (a little, very little, in my case) and are in the stages of trying to
    get their project growing. What it will grow into remains unknown. I do like their
    layout, and would like to be involved in Medium if and when it turns into the
    next big thing, whatever that might be.... but I also don't want to just go over
    there and abandon my blog. First, Medium is just articles; you can't have any
    sidebars with links to other people's sites, and I think such links are valuable,
    so visiting there is very different. Two, I don't know if Medium won't just disappear
    two months from now.

    here, and then linking there. (By contract, I'm not supposed to post in both places,
    at least not before a significant delay.). I'm not sure what else to do. The dilemma
    has in fact hurt my blogging, as some days I've started writing about something,
    then fallen into internal debate about whether to post here, or over there, or
    what else I might do, and then.... just gave up after an hour and did something
    else, like clean the gutters or walk the dogs.
