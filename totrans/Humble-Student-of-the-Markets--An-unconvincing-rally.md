# Humble Student of the Markets: An unconvincing rally

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2011/11/unconvincing-rally.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2011/11/unconvincing-rally.html#0001-01-01)

Despite the rally in the stock market in the last couple of days, I find this rally to be rather unconvincing. First of all, a look at the Spyders show that the rally was on tepid volume and the ETF kissed its Fibonacci retracement target yesterday:

There is a lot of financial risk emanating from Europe. If the rally was for real, then the indicators of pressure on the financials should be coming down. Why have the US banks been underperforming in the last two days? (Note that this performance was before the news of the wholesale

[Standard and Poor's bank downgrade](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-11-29/s-p-cuts-bank-of-america-citigroup-goldman-ratings-in-industry-revision.html)

.)

Across the Atlantic, the message from the bond market is a story of increasing risk. The yield on the

[10-year Portuguese notes](http://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GSPT10YR:IND)

have been skyrocketing in the last two days:

The yield on the

[10-year Irish note](http://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GIGB10YR:IND)

 substantially rose yesterday as well:

 The

[10-year Italian note](http://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GBTPGR10:IND)

, which somewhat stable, isn't looking all that healthy either:

If this was to be a sustainable bull phase, then measures of financial risk should be coming down. They're not, and that leads me to think that this market experienced a brief short covering rally and has more potential to the downside than the upside.

***Addendum:***

Soon after I put up this post, we have the news of

[coordinated central bank intervention](http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/news/2011/138.htm)

in US Dollars, Sterling, "Japanese yen, euro, Swiss francs and Canadian dollars". Stocks have staged a rip-roaring rally.

***It is curious, however, that 10-year yields in Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Italy are all rising despite the news, indicating that the bond market believes that risk premiums are rising, not falling.*** *Cam Hui is a portfolio manager at [Qwest Investment Fund Management Ltd](http://www.qwestfunds.com/).
