Willie Stark (aka Huey Long) in

*[All the King's Men](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_the_King's_Men)*

:

> "Im going to build a hospital, the biggest that money can buy, and it will belong to you. Any man, woman, or child who is sick or in pain can go through those doors and know that everything will be done for them that man can do. To heal sickness, to ease pain, free - not as a charity but as a **right**. And it is your **right**, do you hear me? It is your **right**. And it is your **right** that every child should have a complete education.

The Chinese are currently willing to subsidize our plethora of economic rights, but I wish they would stop so we could adopt a truly sustainable balance between rights and revenues. Alas, Romney's latest

[Kinsley gaffe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_gaffe#Kinsley_gaffe)

has set off a firestorm of outrage because it hits home: many people are sustained by perpetual forced charity. Clearly charity is good in some situations--temporary help, even permant help for those truly disabled--but the system is now out of control.

No one likes to think of themselves as parasites so their benefits are redefined as rights, or no different than social security or those taking advantage of tax breaks. Yet taking food stamps and avoiding federal taxes through muni bonds, are fundamentally different. Many would like us to believe that all these omnipresent mandatory transfers (social security) and tax incentives make us all equal recipients of government aid (argued as well as can be by Mark Schmitt

).

 The bottom line is that

[Arthur Brooks](http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2010/06/arthur-brooks-on-happiness.html)

is right when he says people only gain satisfaction via earned success, not charity. This is why, if you want to gain someone's affection, you should ask them a favor as opposed to doing one for them, because the former implies they are truly valued for something they can do, whereas anyone can receive charity. Those who advocate redistribution therefore are strongly incented to convince others and themselves these cases are not charity, but no different than a tax break on muni bonds, or simply a human right that exists via natural law. In a similar way affirmative action supposedly doesn't mean targeted groups are on average less qualified, but you can tell no one really believes this because people get so very emotional if you ever mention this to an affirmative action supporter (people don't get excited when you say 2+2=5).
