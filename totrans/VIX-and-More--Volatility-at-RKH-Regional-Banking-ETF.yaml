    [HOLDRS](http://www.holdrs.com/holdrs/main/index.asp?Action=Definition) regional
    banking ETF, on [Wednesday in Regional Banking Woes Worsen](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/06/regional-banking-woes-worsen.html),
    where I also posted a graph of RKH’s six month stock price and 30 day implied
    volatility.

- en: I am revisiting RKH today with a slightly different chart, also courtesy of
    the [ISE](http://www.ise.com/), that compares RKH’s [implied volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/implied%20volatility)
    and [historical volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/historical%20volatility)
    over the past six months.  In the chart below, notice that the implied volatility
    in this ETF has been more of an uptrend than the spike from mid-March.  Notice
    also that implied volatility appears to have hit a plateau and is still far below
    the mid-March peak.

    six month high right now, as historical volatility has been trending down over
    the past three weeks at the same time implied volatility has been trending up.

    it usually preceded a drop in implied volatility; conversely, where historical
    volatility has been depressed, this has a tendency to precede an uptick in volatility.  Volatility
    extremes often signal turning points.  Whether the current high implied volatility
    and low historical volatility means that the regional banks are finally bottoming
    remains to be seen, but I have to believe that the probability of a bottom is
    increasing with each volatile session.
