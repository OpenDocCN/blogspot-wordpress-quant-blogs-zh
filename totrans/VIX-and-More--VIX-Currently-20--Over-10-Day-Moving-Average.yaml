- en: At 27.22, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) is currently at its highest level
    since the beginning of the month. Perhaps more importantly, the VIX is at its
    second highest level relative to its 10 day simple moving average (+20.0%) since
    the November 20, 2008 all-time high close of 80.86.

    have to be wary that the SPX has also broken its 50 day moving average level of
    1050.

- en: Some of my [earlier analysis](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/10/does-pullback-have-legs.html)
    suggested a good target bottom for the SPX is in the 1037-1041 range. With a little
    more than 20 minutes to go in today’s session, we are just a couple of points
    away from the top of that range.
