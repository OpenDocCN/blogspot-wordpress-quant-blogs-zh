I'm going to be participating the

[The Festival of Traders](http://www.tigersharktrading.com/2013FOT.htm?src=hanna12)

this month for the 1st time.  It is a 2-day event that features presentations from 8 traders.

I'll be speaking about Fed-based edges in regards to numerous time-frames (from short-term to long-term, and in between).  My talk is scheduled for 5:30pm EST on Tuesday, Dec 10th.  Time not convenient?  No worries!

[Register using this link](http://www.tigersharktrading.com/2013FOT.htm?src=hanna12)

and recordings of all speakers will be automatically sent to you at the conclusion of the Festival.

And beyond my talk, the line-up looks very impressive.  In fact, on Wednesday 2 of the 7 guys I placed on

[my list of "Real Deal Traders"](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2013/09/7-real-deal-traders-with-quality.html)

will be talking - Scott Andrews and Dave Landry.

This is a Quantifiable Edge I suggest you take advantage of :)
