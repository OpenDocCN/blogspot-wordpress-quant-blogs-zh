    oscillator (ITBM). The 14-day RSI of ITBM had recycled from an overbought condition,
    which was a sell signal for the stock market. In the past, ITBM sell signals have
    resolved with 5-10% drawdowns and the market bottomed with the ITBM RSI fell to
    an oversold or near oversold condition.
