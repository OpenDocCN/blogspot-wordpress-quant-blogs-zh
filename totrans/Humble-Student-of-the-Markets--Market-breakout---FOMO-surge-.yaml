- en: ': Last week''s upside breakout through resistance was impressive. Since then,
    the market has consolidated above the breakout level, but a FOMO (Fear Of Missing
    Out) rally has yet to materialize. In the past, such surges have been accompanied
    by a series of "good overbought"  5-day RSI readings, signs of buying stampedes
    from TRIN, only to see the rally stall when the 14-day RSI becomes oversold.'
