    provides an overview of how Google is moving from Borg to [Omega](http://eurosys2013.tudos.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/paper/Schwarzkopf.pdf),
    and Twitter on the Mesos road.  [Mesos](http://incubator.apache.org/mesos/) provides
    isolation of tasks via the Linux [container](http://lxc.sourceforge.net/) which
    has gained traction for obvious reasons.'

    and reading the articles linked above, one can’t help thinking that DataSynapse
    and Platform did well to sell to TIBCO and IBM over the last few years, as in
    many ways, there products are dead today.  Let’s hope the banks, who historically
    have had the typical desk silo’d compute cluster calculating risk etc (paying
    licensing fees to DataSyanpse/Platform) are looking at the advances that Twitter
    and Google are making in resourcing sharing.
