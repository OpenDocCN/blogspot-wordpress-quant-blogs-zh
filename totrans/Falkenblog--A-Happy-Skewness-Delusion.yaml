    returns. This is because empirically investors tend to be highly undiversified,
    and have a bias towards highly volatile stocks, and so they seem to want big lottery-type
    payoffs (incidentally, this is the exact opposite to what Nassim Taleb states
    is common, that people prefer payoffs that have high modes and low means--negative
    skew). Anyway, In the early days of portfolio theory, reconciling the desire to
    take such big risks was considered side by side with minimizing variance, as Markowitz
    looked at both approaches back in 1952 but eventually just sided with the total
    variance approach, and preference for positive skew was abandoned as an exception
    to a mean-variance rule.

    irrational, in that if there is a skewness preference and a risk aversion preference,
    then the skewness preference will be pretty tame, and as

    Rational risk averse investors would not take a lot of risk with some of their
    assets, at least, not enough to affect pricing much. That's why I like the Statman
    and Shefrin model, because they explicitly say this doesn't make sense if investors
    are rational risk averse investors (at least, with risk conventionally defined),
    unlike Harvey and Siddique who try to cram this into a fully rational model and
    ignore how it all fits together.

     The benefits of being ex ante biased towards skewed assets outweighs the ex post
    costs of having inefficient portfolios.  These highly skewed assets make it possible
    to conceive of an aspirational state of much greater wealth, as such an event
    is possible, though improbable.  Your excessive optimism makes you better off
    because you anticipate a small probability payoff incorrectly, but since your
    happiness is the discounted value of these beliefs, you are a happier deluded
    self. Think about all the time you have spent considering what you would do if
    you won the lottery, as surely everyone has done that at least once. The cost
    can be pretty low (for a lottery ticket, $1), but the benefit of visualizing that
    fantasy pretty large, and it doesn't keep me in a debilitating stupor because
    I don't do this much (moderation in all things).

    be a rational, general equilibrium model, when its not (funny how general equilibrium
    models built on fundamental preferences are usually quite parochial because of
    their limited assumptions).  But I like the intuition, or find it intriguing.
     It's nice to think we are on a journey with sealed orders with some higher purpose
    that we aren't privy to, but it exists and is important. It may not be true, but
    it's comforting to think so, and doesn't really cost much.
