    of targeting the bulk of an investor`s equity exposure to the US and Asia X-Japan.
    Here is a chart of the relative returns of the US (SPY), Europe (FEZ) and Greater
    China (equal weighted FXI, EWH, EWT, EWY) relative to the MSCI All-Country World
    Index (ACWI). These relative returns are useful in that they all use ETFs trading
    in USD so there are no currency effects.

    global stocks since 2010 and there is no technical sign that that relative uptrend
    is likely to be broken. Further, the latest BoAML shows that institutional managers
    have pulled back from their US weights and they are roughly neutrally weighted
    in US stocks, which can give them more room to run.

    the contrarian more cautious about this region. Expectations are running high

    the Greater China ETF basket is a useful way of getting exposure to China and
    its major Asian trading partners.This basket rallied through a multi-year relative
    downtrend and seems to be on its way to better relative returns. I had also highlighted
    the constructive chart patterns of the stock markets of China's Asian trading
    partners in my recent post (

    the BoAML Fund Manager Survey, the greatest overweights are India, the Philippines
    and New Zealand, which indicates a possible contrarian long position in the Greater

    instinct was to think about the eurozone. Upon further study, the excessive optimism
    about the eurozone was a surprise to me. My conclusion is to tilt the weight of
    the equity portion of a portfolio towards the US and Asia xJapan.
