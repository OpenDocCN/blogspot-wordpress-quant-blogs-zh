- en: Back in the 90s it had to be Swiss Bank, now merged with [UBS](http://www.ubs.com).
    They were the first to dress down, the first to put flat screen on the trading
    floor, and they used [Next](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT_Computer) workstations.
    They used [Objective-C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C). They had also
    bought the O’Connor derivative shop in Chicago, and so owned the prediction technology
    developed by the [Prediction Company](http://www.predict.com/html/introduction.html).
    Read [the Predictors](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0805057560) for
    more on this.

    Looks like they’ve gone very web 2.0, with social software and lots of [blogging](http://www.confusedofcalcutta.com/).
