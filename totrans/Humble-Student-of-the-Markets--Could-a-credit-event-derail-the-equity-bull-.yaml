    their recession odds in the last week. More importantly, Fed Chair Powell revealed
    during the post-FOMC meeting press conference that Fed staff had upgraded its
    forecast from a mild recession in H2 2023 to no recession.

    the bond market remains nervous. The VIX Index, which is the option implied volatility
    of stocks, has been steadily falling, indicating the expectation of lower risk.
    On the other hand, the MOVE Index, which is the bond market’s equivalent of VIX,
    is still elevated.

    while the bond market is still concerned about a recession. In addition, the Bank
    of Japan’s decision to ease its yield curve control program has rattled the bond
    market. Equity bulls run the risk of a credit event which could spark a bear market.
    Here is my assessment of that risk.
