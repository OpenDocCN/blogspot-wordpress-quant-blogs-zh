    radios to local governments for networking their offices. Then the traders discovered
    microwave and everything changed for the radio vendors. Their new customers weren’t
    so much concerned about the cost—they just wanted the lowest-possible latency
    in the radios and repeaters.

    for 50 years. Then they issued [a press release](https://www.tcibr.com/tcis-hf-antenna-business-still-strong-after-50-years/)

    other sites by looking in an FCC database of experimental licenses. More on these
    licenses below, but as you can guess from the name, holders of such licenses can
    be expected to be doing some experimenting. I’m sure there are many technical
    and business experiments happening that we can’t see, but antenna changes are
    hard to hide. Consider what’s happened at the West Chicago tower site in the four
    months since I discovered it.

    aren’t identical, but I’ve still tried to make a fair juxtaposition with cropping
    and zooming. The changes have replaced fairly broadband shortwave antennas with
    more narrow band antennas and strengthened the mounting system holding the antennas
    to the tower. The boom length on the new antennas is nearly double that of the
    previous antennas, giving them more gain. It looks to me like they’ve decided
    on a narrower band of frequencies and want more oomph, which can be turned into
    better reliability or more throughput. Shortwave trading appears to be a rapidly
    changing field.

    it become effectively “table stakes” for any serious participant in ocean-crossing

    to share at a single site. Since a single microwave link can offer hundreds of
    megabits of bandwidth, McKay can offer a “private bandwidth” service where fractions
    of the total link bandwidth are for sale. Even if that business model is unlikely
    to work for shortwave, the market data distribution model of [Quincy Data](https://www.quincy-data.com)

    FCC records for it, but by eye, I can tell you that it’s pointing in the direction
    of Secaucus. To be fair, that’s also the direction of LaGuardia Airport and Central
    Park, so I have no certainty in the microwave destination.

    there have communicated with aircraft in recent decades. Only the last two years
    show any signs of new activity that seems to match the pattern seen in use by
    shortwave traders elsewhere. But if traders are now working there, it’s not the
    first time. [A book on radio published in 1922 describes a small cottage](https://earlyradiohistory.us/1922RCA.htm)
    in the woods at Riverhead where one “would never suspect that one fifth of the
    trade of the United States with Europe is practically conducted.” Nearly a century
    ago, prices sent by Morse code from Europe were received at Riverhead and then
    sent over land lines to 64 Broad St. in Manhattan, driving international trade.

    I’m no expert in this area, so I sought the perspective of [Bennett Z. Kobb](http://www.kobb.bz/)
    before I left Washington DC. He’s a veteran watcher of the wireless industry and
    curator of [@experimradio](https://mobile.twitter.com/experimradio), an excellent
    Twitter feed highlighting interesting FCC experimental licenses. I’ve boiled my
    understanding of our conversation down to a few paragraphs for others who want
    some regulatory insight into shortwave trading.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If your business wants to set up a microwave link between two offices, the FCC
    has a category of licenses just for you. If you want to be an AM, FM, or TV broadcaster,
    there’s obviously a category of licenses for that. There are even licenses for
    shortwave broadcasting to the general public. But what if your business wants
    to set up a private shortwave link between international offices? Sorry, there’s
    no permanent license category for that. Nobody ever wanted such a license until
    recently.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: FCC experimental licenses seem to be the category of choice today. These allow
    experimental operation for a few years and may be renewed. Historically, experimental
    licenses shared some constraints of amateur licenses, specifically the old rules
    contained prohibition of commercial use and encryption. However, the [rationale
    behind new rules](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-13-15A1.pdf) issued
    in 2013 says they were “modernized,” specifically to “keep pace with the speed
    of modern technological change.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The rationale for rule change also mentions that it’s often proprietary business
    interests that drive technological change. Hence an applicant can ask the FCC
    not to publicly disclose proprietary parts of their application. ([Example redacted
    application](https://apps.fcc.gov/els/GetAtt.html?id=170747&x=).) The proprietary
    information could describe novel technologies, questions to be answered by the
    experiment, and future business plans. But even if the FCC agrees not to disclose
    proprietary information from the application, the granted license will still reveal
    the transmitter location, frequencies used, other basic technical data, and contact
    information.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s clear to any FCC observer that rules do change over time. My best guess
    is that shortwave traders running unsuccessful experiments will just let their
    licenses expire. But those achieving success will renew, while petitioning the
    FCC for a rule change that would create a new license category allowing permanent
    operation. But note that the ocean-crossing properties of shortwave also make
    it subject to regulation by more than just the FCC. Clearly, there are mechanisms
    for this, but the international wrinkle will probably delay such permanent rule
    changes compared to domestic-only changes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: From my own perspective, I’ve now observed at least four different companies
    placing large bets on the future success of shortwave trading. They’re not skirting
    regulations and hoping that the regulators don’t notice. They’ve requested, and
    received, FCC licenses for their operation. Even though they’re limited-term licenses
    today, I can infer from the size of the bets that the traders see a path to continued
    legal operation.

    with multiple paths that may differ in bandwidth and latency. It describes “command
    data” such as an order to buy or sell and also “triggering data” that causes the
    command to run, perhaps with simple parameters that can be delivered with the
    trigger.
  prefs: []

    The code and the orders can be sent over the fiber, with shortwave carrying only
    the trigger of *when* to sell, perhaps with small parameters.

    better than others, so how do you decide among them? Your goal is to receive a
    faint signal coming from across an ocean, so you want to choose a receiving location
    away from noise sources. You might build a portable broadband shortwave receiver
    device that logged noise readings to an SD Card for later analysis. Adding a solar
    panel would remove the need to change batteries. You might take your device to
    each proposed receiving site, chain it down, hope nobody notices, and collect
    a few weeks of data on the local noise levels so that you had data for comparing
    the receive sites.
