    one of the brokers (I'm not a high net worth individual). This firm is a global
    brand with $540B or so under management. He spoke in very simple terms, as if
    these people knew about as much about markets as your average person who reads
    the paper. The lead speaker tried to explain their Dynamic Asset Allocation strategy,
    that purported to lower risk. It did this by basically emulating a put option,
    also known as Portfolio Insurance, reducing equity exposure in draw downs (Leland
    and O'Brian and Rubinstein famously did this with a lot of money, exacerbating
    the the

    have helped in 2008 as the increase in volatility occurred prior to the big drawdown
    in the second half of 2008, but other than that the time series data generally
    shows that such a rule merely lowers one's return.

    specifically drawdowns, and did not lower returns. It seems that lower risk is
    only tolerable if it doesn't hurt returns, because they were very clear about
    this.

    mainly done via overlaying with a hedge, as opposed to exiting positions, because
    this had lower tax implications. This highlights that having different taxes on
    assets based on how long they are held, or whether the return is dividends, capital
    gains, or interest, just increases financial complexity. The more the government
    tries to favor the kind of investment they like, or more likely increase taxes
    on areas with less political support, creates more derivatives, more trades, and
    only helps the middleman. If one really hates how much the average Goldman Sachs
    employee makes (which somehow represents all Wall Street, if not all 'bankers'),
    they should stop trying to direct investment via tax policy, and treat it all
    as ordinary income.
