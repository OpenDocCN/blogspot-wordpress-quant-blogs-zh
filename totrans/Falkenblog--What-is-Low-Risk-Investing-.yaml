    one of the brokers (I'm not a high net worth individual). This firm is a global
    brand with $540B or so under management. He spoke in very simple terms, as if
    these people knew about as much about markets as your average person who reads
    the paper. The lead speaker tried to explain their Dynamic Asset Allocation strategy,
    that purported to lower risk. It did this by basically emulating a put option,
    also known as Portfolio Insurance, reducing equity exposure in draw downs (Leland
    and O'Brian and Rubinstein famously did this with a lot of money, exacerbating

    have helped in 2008 as the increase in volatility occurred prior to the big drawdown
    in the second half of 2008, but other than that the time series data generally
    shows that such a rule merely lowers one's return.

- en: But I was most interested that the practitioner insisted this lowered volatility,
    specifically drawdowns, and did not lower returns. It seems that lower risk is
    only tolerable if it doesn't hurt returns, because they were very clear about
    this.

- en: Another interesting point was that changing equity or currency exposure was
    mainly done via overlaying with a hedge, as opposed to exiting positions, because
    this had lower tax implications. This highlights that having different taxes on
    assets based on how long they are held, or whether the return is dividends, capital
    gains, or interest, just increases financial complexity. The more the government
    tries to favor the kind of investment they like, or more likely increase taxes
    on areas with less political support, creates more derivatives, more trades, and
    only helps the middleman. If one really hates how much the average Goldman Sachs
    employee makes (which somehow represents all Wall Street, if not all 'bankers'),
    they should stop trying to direct investment via tax policy, and treat it all
    as ordinary income.

  zh: 另一个有趣的观点是，改变股权或货币暴露主要是通过对冲进行的，而不是退出头寸，因为这样做对税收影响较小。这突显出，由于持有资产的时间长短以及回报是股息、资本收益还是利息而导致资金复杂性增加，对资产的不同税收只会增加金融复杂性。政府试图优惠他们喜欢的投资，并且很可能增加那些得不到政治支持的领域的税收，这会导致更多的衍生品、更多的交易，只会帮助中间商。如果有人真的讨厌高盛公司员工的平均收入（这在某种程度上代表了整个华尔街，如果不是所有的'银行家'），他们应该停止试图通过税收政策来指导投资，而将其视为普通收入。
