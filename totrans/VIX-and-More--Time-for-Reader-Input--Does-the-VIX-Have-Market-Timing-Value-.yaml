    to think highly of, is out today with an interesting point of view in [Putting
    on the VIX](http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/mark-hulbert-putting-vix/story.aspx?guid=%7B30378D20-7CA5-4B91-ADCB-2591BD381C3C%7D&dist=hpts)
    over at MarketWatch.  The subtitle, “Commendary:  Not necessarily bullish that
    VIX briefly rose above 30 last week” summarizes Hulbert’s position nicely, but
    I want to highlight several quotes from the article.'

- en: '*“Even in those situations in which the VIX does appear to have statistically
    significant ability to forecast market movements, it turns out that those abilities
    largely derive from no special insights on the part of the VIX itself, but instead
    because of the stock market''s tendency to rebound after steep corrections.*'

- en: '**I owe this latter insight to Samuel Eisenstadt, research director at Value
    Line, Inc.  Eisenstadt several years ago designed an econometric test to see if
    high VIX readings contain any unusual market-timing information after market declines,
    above and beyond the already-apparent fact that the market has just fallen. He
    came away empty-handed. High VIX readings tell us nothing more than we would already
    know from casually reading the news headlines.*'

    several weeks. But if it does so, it won''t be because the VIX momentarily rose
    above 30 last week.”*'

    VIX as follows:'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*“…consider first how the stock market performed over the subsequent month
    following a VIX close above 30: On average over the past 18 years, it gained 3.8%
    (as measured by the Dow Jones Wilshire 5000 index).  In contrast, the stock market
    gained just 0.7% over the subsequent month following VIX closes below 30… Furthermore,
    similar contrasts existed at the quarter, six-month and 12-month horizons.”*'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*“…there''s no way of knowing how high the VIX will rise when it first crosses
    the 30 threshold. Sometimes, like last week, the stock market immediately rises
    when that ceiling is broken, leading in most instances to the VIX falling back
    below 30\. On other occasions, however, the stock market continues declining despite
    the VIX rising above 30, causing the VIX in most cases to continue rising. The
    all-time high for the VIX is 45.74.*'

- en: '**So even though, other things being equal, higher VIX readings are more bullish
    than lower ones, there''s nothing particularly magical about the 30 level.*'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**To correct for this sleight of hand, I focused on just those occasions in
    which the VIX initially broke the 30 ceiling, after having been below 30 for at
    least three months previously. The data now painted an entirely different picture:
    Following those occasions, the stock market on average performed no better than
    it did the rest of the time.”*'

- en: Readers, what do you think?  Do you find Hulbert’s arguments convincing?  Why
    or why not?  What other important perspective and/or data do you think Hulbert
    is overlooking here?  I would be interested in hearing some reader opinions in
    the comments below.****
