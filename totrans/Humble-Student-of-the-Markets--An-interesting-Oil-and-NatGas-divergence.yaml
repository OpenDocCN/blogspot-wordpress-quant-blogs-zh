    $100 natural gas languished in the $7-8 range, compared to the highs of $14-16
    seen in late 2005\. The accompanying change shows the ratio of the price of natural
    gas to crude oil futures. I have used the 12-month strip as the reference prices
    (1/12th the front month + 1/12th the 2nd month + … + 1/12th the 12 month future)
    as natural gas prices can be seasonal. The chart shows that natural gas prices
    are probing new lows against oil prices.

    of as the “smart money”, are excessively long natural gas and giving a bullish
    signal. On the other hand, the signal from the COT data for crude oil can be best
    described as neutral.

    a timing tool. These conditions have persisted for several weeks. Just because
    these conditions are at extremes doesn’t mean that they can’t get stretched further.
