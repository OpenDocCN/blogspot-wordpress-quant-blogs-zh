    One runs through labour productivity, which is often affected by schooling choices,
    parents’ private investment in education outside the educational system and individuals’
    own investment in higher education. The extent to which productivity is then reflected
    in wages is influenced by labour market institutions, which vary across countries.
    Parents can also affect the success and integration in the labour market in more
    indirect ways, such as through the transmission of social norms, work ethics or

    bequeath their status to their children and children's children. Those descendants

    and content with its situation. The high land-price policy is a form of tax on
    the middle class, which will slow its growth. China may become a country with
    a small group of the super-rich, a vast lower class with no property, and a small
    middle class. Such a social structure would not be good for long-term stability.
