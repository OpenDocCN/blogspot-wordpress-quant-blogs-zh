    popular ETFs USO and UNG, is launching an ETF that is designed to combat the return

    better than broad-based commodity baskets or commodities for which futures markets
    are contangoed. The idea behind USCI is that the optimal form of commodity exposure
    is achieved through positions in backwardated markets or markets that exhibit
    the least degree of contango.'

    or exceed the popularity of USO and UNG. Were this to happen, the buying pressure
    put on some of these commodities, which can be quite thin and illiquid, would
    create enormous return eroding price distortions.
