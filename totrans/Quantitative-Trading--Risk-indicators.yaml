- en: '[TED spread](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=.TEDSP:IND)  to decide
    what leverage I should use for my trading strategies. It turns out that this procedure
    is just as critical for the current crisis that began in August 2011\. In fact,
    more than leverage-determinants, they can be used as the all-important variable
    that determines whether a certain strategy should be run at all. (What''s the
    point of running a model that you think will lose money with low leverage?)  There
    are now more than a few of these risk indicators to pick from. Besides the VIX
    and the TED, there are the [VSTOXX](http://www.stoxx.com/indices/index_information.html?symbol=V2TX)
    (EURO STOXX 50 Volatility), the [VXY](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=JPMVXYG7:IND)
    (JPMorgan G7 Volatility Index), the [EM-VXY](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=JPMVXYEM:IND)
    (JPMorgan Emerging Market Volatility Index), the ETF''s [ONN](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ONN) and
    [OFF](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=OFF&ql=1), and probably many more that I haven''t
    heard of yet.   A lot of academic research has been done on whether we can devise
    "[regime switching](http://epchan.blogspot.com/2008/05/machine-learning-regime-switching.html)"
    models based on some complicated pattern-recognition algorithms to decide whether
    a market is in a certain "regime" which favors this or that particular model or
    parameter set. And often, these regime switching models rely on the recognition
    of some complicated set of patterns in the historical price series. Sorry to say,
    I have not found any of these complex regime switching model to have any real
    out-of-sample predictive power. On the other hand, my research shows that some
    of the aforementioned simple risk indicators will indeed prevent some trading
    models from falling off the cliff.  But which of these indicators are applicable
    to which model? This is not so obvious. For example, you might think that the
    EM-VXY would be an ideal leading indicator for Forex trading models that involve
    emerging market currencies, but I have found that it is only a contemporaneous
    (and thus useless) indicator to mine. Another example, I said during the 2008
    financial crisis that VIX seems to be a useless contemporaneous indicator for
    equities trading models, but strangely, it is a good leading indicator for FX
    models. In contrast, the TED spread that everyone were obsessed about in 2008
    shot up to over 300 bps then, but never went beyond 100 bps this time around.
    So really only rigorous backtesting can guide us here.  What risk indicators do
    you use? And have you really backtested their efficacies? Your comments would
    be very welcome here.'
