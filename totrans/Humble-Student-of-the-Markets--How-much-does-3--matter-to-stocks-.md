# Humble Student of the Markets: How much does 3% matter to stocks?

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models**

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post, 

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The

**Trend Model**

is an asset allocation model which applies trend following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or contraction (bearish)?"

My inner trader uses the 

**trading component**

 of the Trend Model to look for changes in the direction of the main Trend Model signal. A bullish Trend Model signal that gets less bullish is a trading "sell" signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading "buy" signal. The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. The turnover rate of the trading model is high, and it has varied between 150% to 200% per month.

.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Buy equities*
*   Trend Model signal: Bullish*
*   Trading model: Bullish*

**The 3% question**

The US equity market took fright last week when the 10-year Treasury yield rose above 3%. Stock prices recovered when yields retreated. How much should equity investors worry about a 3% 10-year yield?

Rather than focus on any single level, investors would be advised to concentrate on the interaction between stocks and bonds. Consider the P/E ratio. The factors that drive equity prices are:

*   How fast is the E in the P/E ratio likely to grow?
*   What is the outlook for interest rates and how does it affect the E/P ratio?
