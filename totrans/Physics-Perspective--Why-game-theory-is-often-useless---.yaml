    in any model for competitive equilibrium -- exploring how exchange can in principle
    lead to an optimal allocation of resources -- or more generally in the context
    of game theory, which explores stable Nash equilibria in strategic games.

- en: an equilibrium. You can assume perfectly rational agents and prove the existence
    of an equilibrium, but this may be an irrelevant mathematical exercise. Realistic
    agents with finite reasoning powers might never be able to learn their way to
    such a solution.

- en: More likely, at least in many cases, is that less-than-perfectly rational agents,
    even if they're quite clever at learning, may never find their way to a neat Nash
    equilibrium solution, but instead go on changing and adapting and responding to
    one another in a way that leads to ongoing chaos. Naively, this would seem especially
    likely in any situation -- think financial markets, or any economy as a whole
    -- in which the number of possible strategies is enormous and it is simply impossible
    to "solve the problem" of what to do through perfect rational reflection (no one
    plays chess by working out the Nash equilibrium).

    there may well be others) which addresses this matter of the relevance of equilibrium
    in complex, high-dimensional games in a  generic way. The conclusion is as important
    as it is intuitively reasonable:'

- en: Here we show that if the players use a standard approach to learning, for complicated
    games there is a large parameter regime in which one should expect complex dynamics.
    By this we mean that the players never converge to a fixed strategy. Instead their
    strategies continually vary as each player responds to past conditions and attempts
    to do better than the other players. The trajectories in the strategy space display
    high-dimensional chaos, suggesting that for most intents and purposes the behavior
    is essentially random, and the future evolution is inherently unpredictable.

    equilibrium analyses just don't tell you much. If the agents learn in a plausible
    way, they never find any equilibrium at all, and the evolution of strategic behaviours
    simply carries on indefinitely. The system remains out of equilibrium.

- en: A little more detail. Their basic approach is to consider general two player
    games between, say, Alice and Bob. Let each of the two players have N possible
    strategies to choose from. The payoff matrices for any such game are NxN matrice
    (one for each player) giving the payoffs they get for each pair of strategies
    being played. The cute idea in this analysis is to choose the game randomly by
    selecting the elements of the payoff matrices for both Alice and Bob from a normal
    distribution centered on zero. The authors simply choose a game and simulate play
    as the two players learn through experience -- playing strategies from their repertoire
    of N possibilities more frequently if those strategies give good results.

    any kind of stable behaviour. Rather, no equilibrium is ever found. The typical
    dynamics is reflected in the figure below, which shows the difference in payoffs
    to the two players (Alice''s - Bob''s) over time. Even though the two agents work
    hard to learn the optimal strategies, the complexity of the game prevents their
    success, and the game shows no signs whatsoever of settling down:'

- en: As the authors note, this kind of rich, complex, ongoing dynamics looks quite
    similar to what one sees in real systems such as financial markets (the time series
    above exhibits clustered volatility, as do market fluctuations). There are periods
    of relative calm punctured by bouts of extreme volatility. Yet there's nothing
    intervening here -- no "shocks" to the system -- which would create these changes.
    It all comes from perfectly natural internal dynamics. And this is in a game with
    N = 50 strategies. It seems likely things will only grow more chaotic and less
    likely to settle down if N is larger than 50, as in the real world, or if the
    number of players grows beyond two.

    of equilibrium analyses coming from game theory to complex real world settings.
    Dynamics really matters and cannot be theorized out of existence, however hard
    economists may try. As the paper concludes:'

- en: Our results suggest that under many circumstances it is more useful to abandon
    the tools of classic game theory in favor of those of dynamical systems. It also
    suggests that many behaviors that have attracted considerable interest, such as
    clustered volatility in nancial markets, may simply be specific examples of a
    highly generic phenomenon, and should be expected to occur in a wide variety of
    different situations.
