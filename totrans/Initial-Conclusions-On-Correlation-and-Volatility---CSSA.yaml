    components times the average individual variance of  its components.

    constant, the “surface volatility” of the index can change inexplicably.

- en: 3) If variance/volatility stays the same while correlation goes up, aggregate
    index volatility will increase. The reverse occurs when correlation goes down
    which drives low volatility in bull markets.

- en: 4) In a crisis, both correlations and component variance/volatility  rise quickly
    creating an increase in index variance. The concurrent effect of both accounts
    for the tremendous increase in index volatility.

    forecasting power controlling for correlation. (Mungo and Wilson, 2006)

- en: 8) The risk premium initially thought to be related to higher volatility is
    thus primarily related to fear of increases in market correlation. The risk premium
    is “priced” as implied correlations are persistently higher than realized correlations.
    The index option premiums are higher relative to individual options of the components
    because they hedge correlation risk. (Driessen et al 2005). This accounts for
    the returns earned to those willing to engage in dispersion trading.

- en: '9) The correlation between index components is both stochastic and mean-reverting.
    Thus there is **incrementally more mean-reverting “surface volatility” in the
    index versus sectors or individual stocks**. This accounts for the large discrepancy
    in Sharpe Ratios between  binary DV2 strategies on the index (SP500-SPY) versus
    its sector components (SPYDERS).  A great visual and description was highlighted
    by Jeff Pietsch in his post on mean-reverters here : [http://marketrewind.blogspot.com/2009/07/know-your-mean-reverters.html](http://marketrewind.blogspot.com/2009/07/know-your-mean-reverters.html).
    This also accounts for why Country ETFs respond better to mean-reversion (RSI2,
    DV2 etc) strategies versus Commodity, Sector, and Fixed Income ETFs. This implies
    that relative strength strategies will be more profitable for the latter versus
    the former.'
