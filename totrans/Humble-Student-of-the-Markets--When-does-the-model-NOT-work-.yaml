    Some of its shortcomings are obvious. Before the financial crisis, most macroeconomists
    were blinded by the idea that efficient markets would take care of themselves.
    They did not bother to put financial markets and the banking sector into their
    models. This is a major flaw.

- en: There is a deeper problem, though, that will be more difficult to resolve. This
    is the underlying paradigm of macroeconomic models. Mainstream models take the
    view that economic agents are superbly informed and understand the deep complexities
    of the world. In the jargon, they have “rational expectations”. Not only that.
    Since they all understand the same “truth”, they all act in the same way. Thus
    modelling the behaviour of just one agent (the “representative” consumer and the
    “representative” producer) is all one has to do to fully describe the intricacies
    of the world. Rarely has such a ludicrous idea been taken so seriously by so many
    academics…

- en: The basic error of modern macro-economics is the belief that the economy is
    simply the sum of microeconomic decisions of rational agents. But the economy
    is more than that. The interactions of these decisions create collective movements
    that are not visible at the micro level.

- en: The inflation-deflation timer was built for a bifurcated environment where investor
    sentiment is likely to move from one extreme of inflationary heat to the other
    extreme of deflationary freeze, but not much in between. If other factors were
    to emerge in the years to come that drives growth patterns, e.g. nanotechnology
    becomes a transformative technology or the emergence of longer human lifespans
    changes investment and consumption patterns, the performance of the inflation-deflation
    timer would become unstable.
