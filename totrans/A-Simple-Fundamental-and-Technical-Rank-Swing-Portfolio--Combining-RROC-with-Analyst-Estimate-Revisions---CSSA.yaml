    background focus: combining fundamentals and technicals. For those of you that
    are not aware, CSS Analytics sells stock rankings to institutions and in future
    posts we will preview some of the performance our proprietary research. In this
    series we will look at how to expand upon the super simple RROC strategy using
    a variety of techniques. For newbies, the RROC strategy entails buying the worst
    20 performers in the S&P500 index based on the 1-week % price change (or ROC),
    and shorting the top 20 perfomers. One of the issues with this strategy despite
    its solid performance is the risk versus reward–the equity curve isn’t very smooth,
     and the fact that it tends to hold “torpedo” stocks that would be scary to pull
    the trigger on. Certainly given these two characteristics, it is not recommended
    that a trader should hold a concentrated portfolio using the RROC strategy. Naturally
    fundamentals help to address the previous problem of holding torpedo stocks—companies
    that have improving fundamentals should be less susceptible to extreme moves than
    companies with deteriorating fundamentals. The problem is that many fundamental
    criteria possess “yesterday’s news” and have a tendency to lag price moves. Analyst
    estimate revisions of a company’s next fiscal year earnings projections in the
    most recent month tends to be a good short term predictor of stock returns. If
    earnings estimates are raised, stocks tend to outperform the market, and the half
    life of this effect is not much longer than a month. The reverse happens when
    earnings estimates are lowered. Thus for swing trading strategies, estimate revisions
    help put the “wind at our back” so to speak, and help to ensure that our risk/reward
    is more favorable. This allows the possibility of more concentrated portfolios
    with higher returns without sacrificing too much in terms of risk (more on this
    later). Nonetheless, one persistent pattern with estimate revisions is that it
    lags the most at the onset of new bear markets– just look at the long only strategy
    drawdown starting in 2008\. Suddenly the market “darlings” are over-owned and
    vulnerable to sharp sell-offs. A 200 day moving average rule or position sizing
    based on the market trend easily remedies this issue.'

    RROC. That is, I created a percentile ranking for each factor for every stock
    in the S&P500 and I ranked them all from best to worst.  An equal weight was assigned
    to avoid any overfitting though this is far from optimal—in actuality a higher
    weight on RROC with a smaller weight on estimate revisions produces the best risk/reward
    portfolio. As is my signature, I will assign an acronym: the FT rank. While the
    results are not as high during the bear market as the original RROC, they are
    less volatile and perform much better during the previous years spanning back
    to late 2003\. The combined portfolio produces a 25% annualized return with a
    high Sharpe Ratio. This compares to the S&P500 which has been roughly flat over
    the same time span.  The maximum drawdown of the FT  long/short portfolio is a
    respectable 19%—you might notice that the combined portfolio has far superior
    characteristics than the individual portfolio components. This is due to adding
    another fundamental factor which helps to produce a portfolio that is less likely
    to be mismatched—ie we are not shorting high RROC stocks that also have high estimate
    revisions. The probability of achieving any technical edge is maximized by considering
    relevant technicals (not all are relevant and for a given time frame) in conjunction
    with fundamentals. In the next post we will improve this strategy further.[![FTrank2](img/16e15fe1740f46e256c3bcec7a90263f.png
