- en: It's useful to test longer-term rules, such as trend-following, across many
    cycles. To this end, it is useful to have dates for bull and bear markets. If
    your sample is merely from, say, 2010-2019, you will have 2520 data points, but
    no bear markets. Thus, you can prove such a strategy works by noting the significance
    level of your statistics, but anyone with some knowledge of history would see
    the error. A strategy optimized over only bull markets is, as they say, 'problematic.'
    The US stock market has been in bear markets 20% of the time since 1871.

- en: I have identified 24 US bear markets since 1873\. I'd like to say it is a purely
    objective classification, but there are some judgment calls. Basically, I looked
    for the traditional "20% drawdown" definition. Several bear markets did not actually
    meet this standard--1990, 1957, 1873--but I included them anyway out of respect
    for history. For example, the 'Panic of 1873' occurred in the midst of European
    turmoil, started when the US and many other nations demonetized silver, was the
    first wave of railroad failures, had many bank failures, and even caused a 10-day
    closure of the New York Stock Exchange. The recession from 1873-77 was the longest
    in US history.

    bear market was only down 2% in real terms, though 21% nominally. This bear market
    is referred to as the 'panic of 1884.' As the US just returned to the gold standard
    in 1879, many Europeans were skeptical the US could maintain it and were selling
    their US assets. Many businesses and banks failed. To say this was not a bear
    market because in real terms the markets were virtually flat seems wrong.

- en: I put in the prior bull market gain to give better context. It also explains
    why I have 2 bear markets from 1937-42 as opposed to one, as some have. Given
    the 68% increase from March 1938 through October 1939, and that the cause of the
    '37 slide is so different than the '39 slide, it does not make sense to consider
    the entire '37-'42 period a single bear market.

- en: I used Shiller's data for data prior to 1926, and Ken French's data for afterward.
    Shiller's data is monthly, and this tends to soften cycles, avoiding the true
    peaks and troughs. Shiller's data is a little funky, as for example, his 2020
    February return is flat while the SP500 was down 8%. These discrepancies tend
    to leak over to other months, however, so for measuring bull and bear market returns
    they are probably less problematic.

    point. If you have suggestions on amendments, I would appreciate them. You can
