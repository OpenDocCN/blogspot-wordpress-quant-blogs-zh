- en: Stocks have rallied impressively since the beginning of July, but during that
    period, that has not been a particular [sector](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/sectors)
    which has led the rally. The lack of strong sector leadership can be seen on the
    one hand as a potential impediment to further bullish moves, but also as a sign
    of broad-based support for stocks and a potential inhibitor to a correction.

  zh: 自从7月初以来，股市已经反弹显著，但在此期间，并没有特定的[行业](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/sectors)领导这次反弹。缺乏强劲的行业领导可以一方面被视为进一步牛市行动的潜在障碍，但另一方面也显示出对股市的广泛支持，可能抑制调整。
- en: In the [chart of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week)
    below, I show the performance of the nine AMEX [sector](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/sectors)
    [SPDR](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SPDRs)s since the market’s
    July 2^(nd) lows. Note that materials ([XLB](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLB))
    and industrials ([XLI](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLI)) have
    been the top two performing sectors during the past 2 ½ months, reflecting the
    relative strength in manufacturing. The other two sectors that have outperformed
    the SPX during this period, consumer discretionary ([XLY](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLY))
    and technology ([XLK](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLK)), both
    showed signs of coming to life last week.

  zh: 在下面的[本周图表](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week)中，我展示了自7月2日市场低点以来九个AMEX[行业](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/sectors)SPDR的表现。注意，材料([XLB](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLB))和工业([XLI](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLI))在过去两个半月是表现最好的两个行业，反映了制造业的相对强度。在此期间表现优于SPX的其他两个行业，消费品非必需品([XLY](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLY))和科技([XLK](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLK))，在上周都显示出复苏的迹象。
- en: Going forward, materials and industrials can conceivably continue to lead a
    bull leg, but the rally will benefit substantially if one or more of the others
    sectors rises to meet the challenge. For now at least, my money is on technology
    to step up. That being said, the consumer and financial sectors cannot afford
    to be a significant drag on stocks or the current rally will likely run out of
    steam.

  zh: 向前看，材料和工业可能会继续领导一个牛市阶段，但如果其他一个或多个行业崛起迎接挑战，那么这次反弹将受益匪浅。至少到目前为止，我赌科技会挺身而出。话说回来，消费和金融行业不能让股市有
    significant drag，否则当前的反弹可能会耗尽动力。
