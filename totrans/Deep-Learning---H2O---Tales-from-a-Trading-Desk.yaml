    uses H2O for their Big Data Analytics initiatives and H2O Deep Learning for Fraud
    Detection. Ebay deploys H2O on their data science clusters with Mesos. ShareThis
    uses H2O for Conversion Estimation in Display Advertising to predict performance
    indicators such as CPA, CTR and RPM. MarketShare uses H2O to generate marketing
    plans and What-If scenarios for their customers. Vendavo is using it to build
    Pricing Engines for products and Trulia for finding fixer-uppers in luxury neighborhoods.
    Some retailers and insurance companies are using it to do nationwide modeling
    and prediction of demand to manage just-in-time inventories and recommendations.
