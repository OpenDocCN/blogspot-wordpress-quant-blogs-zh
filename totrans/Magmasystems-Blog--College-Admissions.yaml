    to look at colleges for him. He is a junior in high school, but this is when kids
    start considering colleges seriously. We went to see U Cal at Berkeley, Stanford,
    and Pomona. All three very different colleges.

    cut it anymore. Stanford rejects an awful lot of kids who get 1600''s on their
    SATs. All of the colleges want to see rigorous courses in high school, great grades,
    great SAT I and SAT II and AP/IB scores. But they also want students that are
    unique in some way. The essays that kids have to write for their college applications
    are extremely important.'

    getting increasing difficult to get into the upper-middle tier schools. Applications
    are skewed by professional college counselors who you can hire for $10,000 to
    $30,000 .... you wonder if a kid gets into a certain college because of his/her
    own worth, or because daddy's paycheck is fat enough to hire a pro.

- en: 'Now, we have to capture the one big intangible that my son has into an essay
    .. the fact that he is a leader ... not in the academic sense (ie: he is not the
    editor of the school newspaper nor the quarterback of his school''s football team)
    ... but the fact that he has packs of kids that follow him around, that kids are
    constantly calling him and messaging him, that he can snap his fingers and a whole
    cadre of students will appear to schlep his drumset from gig to gig. In other
    words, someone who has that special magnetism that command attention amongst his
    peers (think Tony Soprano).'

    Is most of the UK clamoring to get into these two schools?)
