- en: I just returned from a trip to California with my son. We have just started
    to look at colleges for him. He is a junior in high school, but this is when kids
    start considering colleges seriously. We went to see U Cal at Berkeley, Stanford,
    and Pomona. All three very different colleges.

  zh: 我刚刚和我儿子从加利福尼亚旅行回来。我们刚刚开始为他寻找大学。他现在是高中三年级，但这是孩子们开始认真考虑大学的时期。我们去参观了伯克利加州大学、斯坦福大学和波莫纳学院。这三所非常不同的大学。
- en: 'Warning to parents: good grades and good standardized test scores just don''t
    cut it anymore. Stanford rejects an awful lot of kids who get 1600''s on their
    SATs. All of the colleges want to see rigorous courses in high school, great grades,
    great SAT I and SAT II and AP/IB scores. But they also want students that are
    unique in some way. The essays that kids have to write for their college applications
    are extremely important.'

  zh: 警告家长：优异的成绩和良好的标准化考试成绩再也不够了。斯坦福大学拒绝了非常多在SAT考试中得到1600分的孩子们。所有大学都希望看到高中严格的课程、优秀的成绩、出色的SAT
    I和SAT II以及AP/IB成绩。但他们还希望学生有某种独特之处。孩子们为大学申请写的文章非常重要。
- en: It is not only amazing difficult to get into the top-tier schools. It is also
    getting increasing difficult to get into the upper-middle tier schools. Applications
    are skewed by professional college counselors who you can hire for $10,000 to
    $30,000 .... you wonder if a kid gets into a certain college because of his/her
    own worth, or because daddy's paycheck is fat enough to hire a pro.

  zh: 不仅进入顶尖学校令人惊叹地困难，而且进入中上层学校的难度也在不断增加。申请受到可以聘请的专业大学顾问的影响，他们的费用从10,000到30,000美元不等。你不禁要问，一个孩子是否因为自己的价值而进入某所大学，还是因为父亲的支票足够大，可以雇佣一个专业人士。
- en: 'Now, we have to capture the one big intangible that my son has into an essay
    .. the fact that he is a leader ... not in the academic sense (ie: he is not the
    editor of the school newspaper nor the quarterback of his school''s football team)
    ... but the fact that he has packs of kids that follow him around, that kids are
    constantly calling him and messaging him, that he can snap his fingers and a whole
    cadre of students will appear to schlep his drumset from gig to gig. In other
    words, someone who has that special magnetism that command attention amongst his
    peers (think Tony Soprano).'

  zh: 现在，我必须把儿子身上那种难以捉摸的一大特质转化为一篇论文……那就是他是一个领导者……不是在学术意义上（比如：他不是学校报纸的编辑，也不是学校橄榄球队的四分卫）……而是因为他有一群孩子跟随他，孩子们不断给他打电话和发信息，他一打响指，就会有一群学生出现，帮助他把鼓组从一场演出搬到另一场。换句话说，就是那种在同龄人中有特殊磁性、能吸引他人注意力的人（想想托尼·索普拉诺）。
