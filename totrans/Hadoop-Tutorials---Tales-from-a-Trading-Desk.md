## Hadoop Tutorials

[Hortonworks](http://hortonworks.com/hadoop-tutorial/hello-world-an-introduction-to-hadoop-hcatalog-hive-and-pig/) seems to have done a good job on offering Hadoop [tutorials](http://hortonworks.com/products/hortonworks-sandbox/#tutorial_gallery), leveraging a [Sandbox](http://hortonworks.com/products/hortonworks-sandbox/).  In particular, they offer a real-time event stream with Apache [Kafka](http://hortonworks.com/hadoop-tutorial/simulating-transporting-realtime-events-stream-apache-kafka/) which is then [persisted](http://hortonworks.com/hadoop-tutorial/real-time-data-ingestion-hbase-hive-using-storm-bolt/) into HBase and Hive using Storm Bolt.  Food for thought
