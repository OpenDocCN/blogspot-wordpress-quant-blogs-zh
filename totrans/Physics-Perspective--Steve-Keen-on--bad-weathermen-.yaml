    fairly well – if those trends continue. But they are as hopeless at forecasting
    a changing economic world as weather forecasts would be, if weather forecasters
    assumed that, because yesterday’s temperature was 29 degrees Celsius and today’s
    was 30, tomorrow’s will be 31 – and in a year it will be 395 degrees.

    forecasts that the maximum temperature in Sydney on January 16 to January 19 will
    be respectively 29, 30, 35 and 25 degrees, it is reporting the results of a family
    of computer models that generate a forecast of future weather patterns that is,
    by and large, accurate over the time horizon the models attempt to predict – which
    is about a week.

    prediction for Hurricane Sandy, correctly placing southern New Jersey near the
    centre of its track forecast. This long lead time was critical for preparation
    efforts from the Mid-Atlantic to the Northeast and no doubt saved lives.

    the average error in track forecasts three days into the future was 518 miles.
    That error shrunk to 345 miles in 1990\. From 2007-2011, it dropped to 138 miles.
    Yet for Sandy, it was a remarkably low 71 miles, according to preliminary numbers
    from the National Hurricane Center.

    who nudge numbers that experience tells them are probably wrong. But they start
    with a model of the weather than is fundamentally accurate, because it is founded
    on the proposition that the weather is unstable.

    stable, and will return to an 'equilibrium growth path' after it has been dislodged
    from it by some 'exogenous shock'. So most so-called predictions are instead just
    assumptions that the economy will converge back to its long-term growth average
    very rapidly (if your economist is a Freshwater type) or somewhat slowly (if he’s
    a Saltwater croc).

    models that assumed the weather was in or near equilibrium, and their forecasts
    were basically linearly extrapolations of current trends.

    role of positive feed backs and instabilities in the atmosphere, and by developing
    methods to explore and follow the growth of such instabilities mathematically.
    That meant modelling in detail the actual  fine scale workings of the atmosphere
    and using computers to follow the interactions of those details. The same will
    almost certainly be true in economics. Forecasting will require both lots of data
    and also much more detailed models of the interactions among people, firms and
    financial institutions of all kinds, taking the real structure of networks into
    account, using real data to build models of behaviour and so on. All this means
    giving up tidy analytical solutions, of course, and even computer models that
    insist the economy must exist in a nice tidy equilibrium. Science begins by taking
    reality seriously.
