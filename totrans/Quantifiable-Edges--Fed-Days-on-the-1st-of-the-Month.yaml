- en: . Of course Wednesday is also the first trading day of August. I’ve documented
    numerous times that since the late 80s the first trading day of the month has
    had a bullish tendency. So I wondered how the market has performed on days that
    a Fed Day has coincided with the first trading day of month. There have only been
    six instances since the late 80s. I've listed them all below.

    instances to draw any conclusions without overwhelmingly lopsided results. Still,
    I thought this was interesting enough to share.
