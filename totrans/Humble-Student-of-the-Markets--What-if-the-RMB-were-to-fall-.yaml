- en: Currency appreciation continues to be an important component of the package
    of reforms needed to transform China’s economy. A stronger renminbi would increase
    household purchasing power, help expand the service and other nontradable sectors,
    boost the labor share of income, and facilitate financial sector reform. The recent
    widening of the intraday trading band is an important step in this regard, as
    it will allow the market to play a stronger role in determining the exchange rate.
    Using this increased flexibility would also have the benefit of allowing for a
    more independent monetary policy. As reserves are well above all standard metrics
    and the ***currency is moderately undervalued***, the real effective exchange
    rate should be allowed to continue appreciating by reducing intervention over
    the medium term.

    China's currency is slightly undervalued against the Dollar and she needs to continue
    to take incremental steps to bring the exchange rate into fair value.

- en: Emerging economies face capital outflows. Between 2009 and 2011, low interest
    rates in developed economies sparked massive flows of hot money into emerging
    economies. The hot money fueled asset inflation and spiced up economic growth
    too. The latter gave the perception of emerging economies decoupling from developed
    ones and incited even more inflow. The asset inflation eventually sparked general
    inflation, which slowed economic growth and diverted money from asset markets.
    The resulting asset deflation further decreases economic growth. Hot money is
    now leaving because it sees the unsustainability of the growth dynamic in emerging
    economies.

- en: The Indian rupee and Brazilian real have declined by one-fifth from their recent
    highs, reflecting pressure from capital outflows. Because China has a controlled
    exchange rate, the outflow has come later, as investors believed in the safety
    of a government-supported exchange rate. ***The weakening economy this year appears
    to have sparked expectations of yuan depreciation. The government support of the
    exchange rate has become an accelerator for capital outflow, as it is increasingly
    viewed as a subsidy for early leavers.***

    that a new trend was emerging in China’s foreign exchange operations. Instead
    of being a net buyer of foreign currencies from the market — and conducting monetary
    policy operations in line with that position — the Chinese state was becoming
    a net seller of foreign currencies onto the market, and adapting its monetary
    policy accordingly.
