    deal has reached an impasse in the Senate. Nevertheless, I was surprised to see
    ES futures up modestly.

- en: Regardless of the outcome of the fiscal cliff negotiations, a review of global
    equity markets indicate that the leadership is outside the US and a fiscal cliff
    relief rally (when it comes) would be a good opportunity for American investors
    to diversify their holdings outside the country. Consider this chart showing the
    relative returns of US stocks compared to MSCI All-Country World (ACWI). US equities
    peaked out on a relative basis in July and have been underperforming global equities
    ever since.

    of the world, this analysis shows that the outlook for US equities may not be
    so bright in 2013\.

- en: When we analyze the weightings in ACWI, the main components by weight are US
    stocks, developed market stocks (EAFE) and the emerging market stocks. EAFE is
    composed mainly of Japan and Europe, with a minor weight in the Asia Ex-Japan
    region. Any way you look at it, developed market stocks, as represented by EAFE,
    are showing relative leadership. They bottomed on a relative basis in August and
    have been roaring ahead ever since. In December, these stocks staged a relative
    breakout indicating sustainable strength.

    extensively about before (see

    staged a turnaround. The chart below of Japan against ACWI shows that Japanese
    stocks have rallied through a relative downtrend that began in October 2011.

    on a relative basis in early September and they have been outperforming ever since.
    Technicians can be encouraged by the fact that EEM staged a relative upside breakout
    against ACWI in early December and they have been on a tear ever since. Much of
    that strength can be attributed to the perceived soft landing in China.

- en: In conclusion, these relative return charts show that US equities have been
    trailing global stocks since the summer of 2012\. Regardless of how the fiscal
    cliff resolves itself, this analysis suggest that equity investors are better
    served by a larger weighting outside the US.
