    Either earnings rise, or the P/E multiple expands. In this Fed tapering era, risk
    premiums are likely to rise and therefore P/Es are likely to fall (see my previous

    QE programs succeeded in lowering risk premiums by pushing market participants
    to take on more risk (reaching for yield, carry trades, etc.) Undoing the effects
    of QE, even though slowly, represents a regime change as risk premiums will start
    to rise. This will represent a headwind for equity valuations longer term, though
    the markets will be choppy as it adjusts by focusing on the headline of the day
    (see my previous blog post [It's the risk premium, stupid!](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2013/07/its-risk-premium-stupid.html))

    risk premiums face upward pressures and therefore P/E ratios face downward pressures.
    If stocks start to face headwinds on the P/E multiple front, then that means it
    is up to earnings to do the heavy lifting if prices were to rise.

    sector in 2013 ? Well, if you read the 2nd quarter, 2013 FDIC earnings report
    released to the public this week, you have record nominal profits for the banking
    sector for the 2nd quarter in a row. However I don't think a lot of people understand
    this concept since so many bank stocks are still trading below their 2007 highs,
    thanks to the dilution of the equity shareholder following the financial crisis.
    The number of fully-diluted shares outstanding for names like Morgan Stanley (MS),
    Bank of America (BAC), AIG (AIG) and others is sometimes quintuple their share
    count since mid, 2007\. (long BAC). Banks and financials are earnings record profits,
    but “per share” earnings have been horribly diluted.

    growth for the sector off the March ’09 market low, have been relatively subdued

    credit conditions have to continue to improve - and improve dramatically. I am
    therefore watching the relative performance of junk bonds relative to the overall
    bond market as a quick-and-dirty way of evaluating the trend in credit. So far,
    junk bond prices continue to be in a relative uptrend, but if they falter - watch
    out!
