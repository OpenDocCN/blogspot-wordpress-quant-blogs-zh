    gift over the last two years that is completely unsustainable.  Any investor/speculator
    that has benefitted from that gift should recognize its existence first and its
    potential expiration second.  Cognitive dissonance at this point might lead to
    a “Master of the Universe” feeling right now even though none of us have had control
    over the decisions or $10 trillion that got us here.  Be grateful for your profits
    but protect them from the reverse as we approach the limits of our policies. 
    Santa comes once a year, but Bernanke and emerging reserves of $10 trillion come
    once in a lifetime.
