    This is something we will be looking at towards creating an improved time machine
    algorithm. The “runs oscillator” is constructed by ranking a down run (if that
    is the current run) versus all down runs in the prior 252 days. The same is done
    for up runs. This leaves two oscillators ranging from 0 to 1 for both up and down
    runs. The runs oscillator is fused together by multiplying the down run oscillator
    by -100 and the up run oscillator by 100 and summing them together. The final
    oscillator ranges between -100 and 100, with 100 representing maximum overbought
    conditions, and -100 being maximum oversold conditions.  In the example below
    we use median overbought and oversold conditions for countertrend entries (long<-50
    and short>50) with an exit on a cross of zero. Essentially we are waiting for
    a median down run for longs, and a median up run for shorts while looking to exit
    on an up day for longs and a down day for shorts. We compare this to reverse daily
    follow through (long 1 down day, short 1 up day). As you will notice, the runs
    oscillator is far more consistent across time and has higher risk-adjusted returns.
