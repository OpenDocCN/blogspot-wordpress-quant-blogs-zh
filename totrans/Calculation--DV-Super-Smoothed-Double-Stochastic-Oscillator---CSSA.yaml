    out some strategy variations on the DV Stochastic using the S&P500.  The combo
    strategy is very interesting. I forwarded him an example spreadsheet for the exact
    calculation of the indicator to post on his site. [http://www.catallacticanalysis.com/strategytests/differentstrategyvariationsDVSSDStochastic.php](http://www.catallacticanalysis.com/strategytests/differentstrategyvariationsDVSSDStochastic.php)

    calculated as (today’s close- min(last 10 days HLC))/(max(last 10 days HLC)-min(last
    10 days HLC))

    last 10 days))/(max(stochastic last 10 days)-min(stochastic last 10 days))

    in the S&P500\. Good luck!
