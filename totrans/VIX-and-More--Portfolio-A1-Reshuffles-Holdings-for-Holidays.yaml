    of 18.9% since the portfolio’s February 16^(th) inception – 16.9% better than
    the 2.0% return of the benchmark S&P 500 index during this period.

- en: Notwithstanding the excellent recent run, this high turnover portfolio continues
    to seek out better opportunities and therefore dropped [DryShips (DRYS)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=drys)
    and [Fresh Del Monte Produce (FDP)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=fdp),
    replacing them with Norwegian energy and aluminum giant [Norsk Hydro (NHYDY)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=nhydy),
    as well as [The Pepsi Bottling Group (PBG)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=pbg),
    a Pepsi subsidiary.  I find the Pepsi move a little surprising, especially since
    the portfolio had already experimented with [PepsiAmericas (PAS)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=pas)
    in November.  How can a computer program have an affinity for a particular brand…?
