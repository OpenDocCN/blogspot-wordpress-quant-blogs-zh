    The latest NFP figures don''t seem to be pointing toward any peak in unemployment.

    continue to adjust their order books, production schedules and staffing requirements
    to a semi-permanently impaired credit backdrop. The bottom line is that the level
    of credit per unit of GDP is going to be much, much lower in the future than has
    been the case in the last two decades. ***While we may be getting close to a bottom
    in terms of employment, the jobless rate is very likely going to be climbing much
    further in the future due to the secular dynamics within the labour market***…

    at some point. Employment is not going to zero, of that we can assure you. But
    when we do start to see the economic clouds part in a more decisive fashion, what
    are employers likely to do first? Well, naturally they will begin to boost the
    workweek and just getting back to pre-recession levels would be the same as hiring
    more than two million people. Then there are the record number of people who got
    furloughed into part-time work and again, they total over nine million, and these
    folks are not counted as unemployed even if they are working considerably fewer
    days than they were before the credit crunch began.

    start tapping into the ranks of the unemployed or the typical 100,000-125,000
    new entrants into the labour force when the economy turns the corner. ***Hence
    the unemployment rate is going to very likely be making new highs long after the
    recession is over — perhaps even years.***

    like generic boosterism for the stock market. While I understand that investment
    advisors may have their own agenda in promoting a certain viewpoint, experienced
    advisors know that success comes from serving their clients’ long-term interests.
