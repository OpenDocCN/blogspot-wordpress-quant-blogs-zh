    Learning With Event Streaming” over on the Monzo [blog](https://monzo.com/blog/2017/05/03/practical-machine-learning-for-startups/).
     The key takeaway if you don’t have time to read the article fully is:'

    as an “event time series”), e.g. user logs in → taps on “money transfer” → encounters
    an error.

    from the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) process and use RNNs to predict
    defects?
