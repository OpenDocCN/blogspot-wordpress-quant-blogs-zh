    quantified by the Street yet. During the Asian Crisis, I can recall sitting in
    a meeting to assess its effects in light of what we were seeing in our quant models.
    One of our EM portfolio managers said that estimate revisions were not moving
    yet because analysts know that earnings are bad, they just have no idea how bad
    so they are not revising them yet. In the current instance where oil prices have
    cratered, the Street knows that the effects are good because of lower input prices
    and higher consumer spending, they just have no idea how good yet. As a consequence,
    EPS estimates are not rising.

    index weight), while EPS estimates for the other sectors are flat to slightly
    up. Expect the positive effects to start filtering through in the weeks ahead.

    impossible because of the rise of previously insignificant fringe parties. The
    Scottish Nationalists look able to boost their six seats in Parliament to anything
    between 20 and 50, largely at Labour’s expense. The United Kingdom Independence
    Party is threatening dozens of Conservative incumbents. Meanwhile, the Liberals
    are almost certain to lose about half their 56-seat representation. As a result,
    a ruling coalition may have to include not just two parties but three or four,
    including fringe nationalist groups.

    While minority governments are quite common in continental Europe, the British
    Parliament has only once failed to produce a government majority — during a brief
    interlude in 1974 under Harold Wilson. It created seismic upheavals in Britain’s
    adversarial politics.
