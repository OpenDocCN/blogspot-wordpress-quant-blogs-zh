    a meeting to assess its effects in light of what we were seeing in our quant models.
    One of our EM portfolio managers said that estimate revisions were not moving
    yet because analysts know that earnings are bad, they just have no idea how bad
    so they are not revising them yet. In the current instance where oil prices have
    cratered, the Street knows that the effects are good because of lower input prices
    and higher consumer spending, they just have no idea how good yet. As a consequence,
    EPS estimates are not rising.

    the Egyptian Sinai have also rallied to the black and white flag of IS, prompting
    Egypt’s leader Abdel al-Sisi to call last week for a “general mobilisation” of
    all leading Arab and Western powers to defeat the spreading movement.

    of dire scenarios, you should not necessarily interpret them as bull market killers.
    The US economy remains in the mid-cycle phase of an expansion and such a scenario
    should be equity positive. The key question to ask of any risk is, ”How will this
    event affect the outlook for earnings, interest rates or global financial system
    stability?” If the answer is, ”Not very much”, then the likely outcome is some
    sort of corrective action in a stock market bull trend.

    trading sell signal on Tuesday and I usually wait a couple of days before acting
    on trend following signals as they have a habit of reversing themselves. But the
    short-term trading model was signaling oversold conditions consistent with a market

    were flashing buy signals. As seen in the chart below, the combination of an inversion
    of the VIX term structure and TRIN greater than 2 forms a powerful buy signal
    that was 100% in the last two years. In addition, the VIX Index had closed above
    20, which is a level that is consistent with trading bottoms.
