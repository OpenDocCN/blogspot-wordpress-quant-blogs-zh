    single market to think about the relative performance of sectors globally and
    how macro conditions affect each region. In a lot of cases, the relative performance
    of American and European sectors to their markets track each other closely and
    their divergence can yield insights about either opportunity or macro differences
    between economic blocs.

    Energy stocks. European energy stocks have far underperformed US energy on a relative
    basis and they are sitting near all-time relative performance lows stretching
    back 18 years.

    are fairly similar. The European Energy sector is dominated by mostly megacap
    integrated companies, e.g. Royal Dutch, Total, etc., while smaller names include
    the likes of ENI and Repsol - all of which are well diversified integrateds. By
    contrast, the US has far higher higher beta exploration and oil service companies
    in its energy universe.

    oils should underperform more than American ones, especially when you consider
    that the price of Brent has performed better in euros than USD.

    The chart below shows that Healthcare stocks (read: Big Pharma) have tracked each
    other fairly well across the Atlantic for many years. Undoubtedly that can be
    attributed to the fact that the pharmaceutical business is a global business and
    these companies sell their products worldwide.'

    relative to the SPX recently, their European counterparts have held up quite well.
    It could be argued that the sell-off could be attributed to a Hillary Clinton
    comment on drug pricing. If that were true, then shouldn't European drug companies
    that sell into the American market suffer equally?

    Survey shows that institutional managers have roughly the same levels of relative
    exposure to both Energy and Healthcare. When I combine the FMS results with the
    relative pricing anomalies, it suggests that there are Trans-Atlantic opportunities
    for traders in these two sectors.
