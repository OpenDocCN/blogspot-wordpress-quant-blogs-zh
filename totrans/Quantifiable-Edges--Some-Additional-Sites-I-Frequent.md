# Quantifiable Edges: Some Additional Sites I Frequent

> 来源：[http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2008/09/some-additional-sites-i-frequent.html#0001-01-01](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2008/09/some-additional-sites-i-frequent.html#0001-01-01)

The market has provided extremely unusual action over the last few days. Precedents are slim when looking at gaps up of 2% or more and other oddities such as yesterday's S&P/NDX divergence. Trying to filter the action further and generate meaningful statistics is a bit of a stretch.

Therefore, I decided this morning would be a good time to add some sites to the blogroll. Below are a few additions that I like to read:

[Marketsci](http://marketsci.wordpress.com/)

– Filled with interesting market studies.

[Woodshedder](http://www.ibankcoin.com/woodshedderblog/)

– A nice mix of mechanical system development and technical analysis.

[Carl Futia](http://carlfutia.blogspot.com/)

– Futures trading and analysis with specific targets provided.

[Cobra’s Market View](http://cobrasmarketview.blogspot.com/)

– Market analysis with a massive chartbook.

[HeadlineCharts](http://headlinecharts.blog.com/)

– One or more interesting charts along with commentary most every day.

[Greenfaucet](http://www.greenfaucet.com/)

&

[Phil’s Favorites](http://www.philstockworld.com/author/phils-favorites/)

– Two sites with a collection of interesting commentary from around the blogosphere.

[ITrade4Real](http://www.itrade4real.com/index.htm)

– See what JP Drake is trading today.

That’s it for now. I’ll add a few more in the coming weeks.
