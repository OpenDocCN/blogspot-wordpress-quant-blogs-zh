    for Citigroup ([C](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/C)) was warmly
    received in the equity markets and has the potential for helping triggering the

    the Citigroup rescue has had in the pricing of [credit default swaps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_default_swap)
    (CDS) of financial institutions. Yesterday, for instance, the cost of credit default

    financial institutions in a manner than the government, firm, and market all find
    acceptable.
