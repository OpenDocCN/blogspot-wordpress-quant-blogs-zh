    st="on">VIXbegone</placename></place>.  Very quiet.  So quiet, in fact, that the
    VWSI remained stuck on a zero reading for the second week in a row and the VIX
    gained only 0.47 points or 1.8%, the fourth lowest weekly change all year.

- en: Consumers were apparently keen on snapping up bargains on Black Friday, where
    sales were [up 8.3% over last year](http://www.shoppertrak.com/news_retail_sales_112407.php)
    and followed through on Saturday, with sales [up 5.4% versus the previous post-Thanksgiving
    Saturday](http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-shopping26nov26,0,5042857.story?coll=la-home-center).  The
    combined Friday-Saturday statistics show a 7.2% increase in sales over 2006, with
    a 4.8% increase in traffic more than making up for a 3.5% decline in purchases
    per person.

    away from the bears remains to be seen, but my personal bias is slightly bullish
    going into the week, despite the weakness in a number of technical indicators.

    apply to the VIX, not to the broader markets, which are usually negatively correlated
    with the VIX.)

- en: '*****Wine pairing:***  For a VWSI of zero, I have heretofore been recommending
    a variety of inexpensive blends.  Just this week I enjoyed the [2005 Trentadue
    Old Patch Red](http://www.trentadue.com/product/22).  This berry explosion is
    an unusual blend of 70% zinfandel, 20% petite sirah, 5.5% carignane and 4.5% syrah.
    Surprisingly, the petite sirah comes through as dominant, with the zinfandel playing
    a rare secondary role, with the exception of what I thought was a touch of residual
    sugar in the finish.  This is a fun wine to drink and at $12 at my local wine
    store, worth seeking out.'
