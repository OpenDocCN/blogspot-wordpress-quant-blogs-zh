- en: If Blogger’s math is to be believed, this is my millennial post. I had originally
    intended to roll this post out with limited fanfare, but a strange confluence
    of events has caused me to reconsider. First, over the weekend, the blog received
    substantial accolades from Barron’s options columnist [Steven Sears](http://online.barrons.com/public/search/results.html)
    in [For the Markets, How Tweet It Is](http://online.barrons.com/article/SB124545040547032535.html).
    Today, the Wall Street Journal’s [MarketBeat](http://blogs.wsj.com/marketbeat/)
    columnist Matt Phillips referred to the “VIX-obsessed blog VIX and More” in his
    [Ugly Start of Week for Stocks as Oil Drops, VIX Jumps](http://blogs.wsj.com/marketbeat/2009/06/22/ugly-start-of-week-for-stocks-as-oil-drops-vix-jumps/).

    evolution of the blog and to help point the many new readers to some of the highlights
    from the first 1000 posts.

    the time, I was looking for an online location to serve as a searchable repository
    for some of my research on the VIX. After sampling some online message boards
    and determining these were too unwieldy, I decided to try blogging. In the first
    week of January, I determined Blogger was the easiest way to take the plunge.
    The VIX handle had already been claimed by another blogger and I figured I didn’t
    want to box myself into such a narrow subject area anyway, so I settled on the
    “and More” escape hatch and plunged in with [VIX and More: An Introduction](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/01/week-in-vix-january-7-2007-introduction.html).
    With the VIX barely out of single digits and left for dead by most, I did not
    expect to see much in the way of traffic, but after a couple of weeks, a few hearty
    souls started dropping in. To highlight the absurdity of devoting a blog entirely
    to the VIX, I added the tagline, “Your one-stop VIX-centric view of the universe…”
    and hoped that the ellipses would be a signal to readers that everything was tongue
    in cheek.'

    at the time I was trading almost 100% stocks – very few options – and did not
    include the VIX in my stable of indicators. I did, however, have a strong belief
    that most of what we learn comes from getting out of our comfort zones, so I embraced
    this electronic journey as a potential learning opportunity.

    joked, “A 20% spike in the VIX, of course.” Well I got a [record 64% spike](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/02/birthday-party.html)
    for my birthday and quite a few curious souls who showed up wondering what it
    all meant. The joke, it turns out, was on me.

    into a full-blown financial crisis, I discovered that I was probably the only
    person who had been thinking about and writing about the VIX and volatility almost
    every day for two years. What started out as a lark has become a serious venture,
    quoted in such publications as the *Wall Street Journal*, *Financial Times*, *Barron’s*,
    *Globe and Mail*, etc.

    with my [VIX Weekly Sentiment Indicator](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VWSI)
    and I was glad to oblige. Recently, I decided to tag a select group of posts with
    the “[lighter side](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/lighter%20side)”
    label to demonstrate that the fear indicator can indeed coexist with an occasional
    attempt at humor.

    fishermen out of all of us, as I strongly believe that ultimately we are all self-coached.
    Occasionally, however, I have not been able to resist making some market calls
    – and I have had the good fortune to nail several of them. When I make calls,
    I usually do so to be provocative and because my thinking is clearly contrarian.

    on March 5^(th) – one day early and 21 points too high.

    diving in I now believe that my analysis of volatility and market sentiment provide
    me with the bulk of my edge and I find that most of my trades involve options
    on ETFs, yet I still intend to keep my trading and the blog largely separate.
    I have a passion for education, market sentiment and options and I think there
    is a lot of work to be done in terms of elevating the discussion in these areas.

    and I am keeping an open mind about the future.
