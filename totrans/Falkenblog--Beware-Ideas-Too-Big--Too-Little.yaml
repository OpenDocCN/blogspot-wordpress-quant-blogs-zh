    really isn't a good way to approach them. Any answer would perforce be a minority
    view based on a lot of unshared assumptions, and hardly amenable to empirical
    or logical analysis in any systematic way. Further, as an economist who actually
    believes in the invisible hand, I think the world will take care of itself better
    if we merely focus on our individual long-run self-interest.

    are not central, rather any fun little anecdote about self-interested behavior
    counts as an equal-weighted brick in the economic foundation. These economists
    revel in their ability to ''explain'' why sumo wrestlers throw matches, why teachers
    cheat on standardized tests, and why people buy gym memberships they don''t use
    (answer: self interest), and indeed these ideas are simple enough to understand
    that they make for popular reading, but academics should always be wary of popularity.
    While economists are not like dentists when it comes to fixing problems they face,
    there are some insights that endure and have application to markets, such as most
    International Trade, Intermediate Microeconomics, or introductory finance. Sure,
    Macro is a clusterpuck, but we know what causes hyperinflation! Growth theory
    is not settled, but lots of persistently popular ideas about long-term economic
    growth can be shown wrong, excluding a lot of bad intuition. It''s not physics,
    but it''s not as bad as sociology either.'

    emphasizes how important this is, because she reminds us earlier that 'Obama can
    not do it alone'. I'm sure that statement put her on the paleo-conservative wing
    of her lunch table (say it ain't so!). Coming from an authority figure, such an
    exhortation to change the world via one's mind and other people may sound profound
    to a 20 year old, but it comes off as adolescent blather to a middle-aged dad
    like myself.

    things. Ideas too small to be generalizable, too big to be soluble, can't be central
    to the canon because we only have so much time, and so mastery of some specialized,
    systematized field of knowledge, is ultimately our best strategy. One can't teach
    common sense, which is why you can't major in it after all these years, and while
    you can teach trivia it is obvious that would be pointless. But we can teach engineering,
    math, or programming. It isn't trivia, but it isn't a life strategy either. It
    is in the middle. The useful things we can know are both abstract and parochial,
    and a simple way to accomplish this is to master a small field. By knowing a single
    area really well can one understand what ignorance really means. If you aren't
    an expert on anything, you do not really understand what ignorance is, how superficial
    knowledge is misleading, and how expert consensus is both the height of best practices
    yet highly fallible.

    anyone's opinion is as valid as any other, and you can find a witty or profound
    supporting quote by great historical thinkers for almost any proposition (eg,
    'early bird gets the worm' vs. 'second mouse gets the cheese'). It is also fun
    to talk about trivia like perception biases among speed daters, because these
    are new facts that are interesting if limited. But the reason a lot of little
    ideas, or a single big idea, tends to bore people is they have experience with
    these ideas going absolutely nowhere. An idea should not be judged solely by its
    importance or its truth, but the triumvirate of importance, truth, and novelty.
    The bigger the idea, the less we can be sure it's true, and less likely it is
    novel; the smaller the idea the less important. So, leave the big ideas and trivia
    to barbecues and late-night bong sessions, and learn some statistics. It won't
    guarantee wisdom, but it's a better base.
