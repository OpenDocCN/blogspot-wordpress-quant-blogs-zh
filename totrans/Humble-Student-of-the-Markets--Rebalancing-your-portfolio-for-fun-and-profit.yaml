  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While a routinely rebalanced portfolio such as a 60-40 equity-bond mix is commonly
    employed by many investors, most do not understand that the rebalancing strategy
    adds risk. Rebalancing is similar to starting with a buy and hold portfolio and
    adding a short straddle (selling both a call and a put option) on the relative
    value of the portfolio assets. The option-like payoff to rebalancing induces negative
    convexity by magnifying drawdowns when there are pronounced divergences in asset
    returns. The expected return from rebalancing is compensation for this extra risk.
    We show how a higher-frequency momentum overlay can reduce the risks induced by
    rebalancing by improving the timing of the rebalance. This smart rebalancing,
    which incorporates a momentum overlay, shows relatively stable portfolio weights
    and reduced drawdowns.

    Lehman Crisis episode, that a rebalanced portfolio where the investor bought all
    the way down would see superior returns. Interestingly, that was not the case.

    i.e. not rebalancing at all, with a fixed weight monthly rebalancing strategy.
    The chart below shows how that the monthly rebalanced portfolio actually showed
    a higher risk profile than the passive drift portfolio. (There were other examples
    in the paper, but I will focus on this period for the purpose of this post).

    to the application of of a trend following system to rebalancing. The idea is,
    as the stock market goes down and the bond market goes up, you keep overweighting
    your winners (bonds) and don't rebalance the portfolio until momentum starts to
    turn. As the chart below shows, the portfolio with the partial momentum overlay
    performed better than either the monthly rebalanced or passive drift weight portfolio.

    using trend following techniques for portfolio construction. However, I would
    add a couple of caveats in my read of this paper.
  prefs: []

- en: First, three of the five authors work for MAN Group, which is known for using
    trend following techniques in their investing. While this paper does show the
    value of these kinds of techniques, I am always mindful that researchers may be
    "talking their own book". As regular readers are aware, I extensively use trend
    following models in my own work, but I am cognizant of the weaknesses of these
    models.
  prefs: []

- en: In particular, these models perform poorly in sideways choppy markets with no
    trends. As an example, consider this chart of sugar prices for the period from
    1891 to 1938\. Unless the trend following system is properly calibrated, the drawdowns
    using this class of model are potentially horrendous.

- en: A second critique of the approach used by the paper is the use of monthly rebalancing
    as one of the benchmarks. In practice, no one rebalances their portfolio back
    to benchmark weight on a monthly basis. A more realistic rebalancing technique
    might be a rule based rebalancing approach of rebalancing either annually or if
    the portfolio weights drift too far from the policy benchmark.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To be fair, however, the monthly rebalancing approach is an extreme one that
    does differentiate between a passive drift weight and a more frequently rebalanced
    portfolio.

    of price momentum, or trend following, techniques of chasing winners to a value-based
    rebalancing strategy of buying assets when they are down.

    program, I urge portfolio managers to further study these approach and adopt it
    to their own circumstances. Your mileage will vary.
