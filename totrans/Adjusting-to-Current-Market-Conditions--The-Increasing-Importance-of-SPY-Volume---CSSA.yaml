    in this case over the last 3 months. Below I present a quick and dirty analysis-
    not as thorough as I would prefer, but enough to highlight some useful data that
    you can further explore. One of the interesting factors that has become quite
    predictive in todays market–at least in predicting the S&P500– is SPY volume.
    More specifically, the 5-day ROC  or 5-day simple moving average of SPY volume
    has performed quite admirably as a market timing indicator. I suppose all of us
    can listen to the  “experts” yap away whether bullish or bearish on CNBC , but
    ultimately the best way to see what their intentions are these days is to look
    at their cards so to speak. It isn’t Mom and Pop that are responsible for increasing
    volume when SPY trades roughly $25 billion dollars a day. No, its the big money
    responsible for doing that–whether its the US government, the banks, or mutual
    funds–it really doesn’t matter. Whenever they buy these days, they are signalling
    the intention of buying over a series of days. Whenever the buying momentum starts
    to fall, the market loses traction. Lets look at the stats over the last 60 trading
    days. Note 5dROC SPY volume stands for the 5-day rate of change of SPY volume–for
    example a positive number indicates that SPY volume is higher than 5 trading days
    ago. “C” stands for today’s close, and C(-1) stands for yesterday’s close. “V”
    stands for today’s SPY volume and V(-1) stands for yesterday’s SPY volume:'

    the most bearish involve falling volume momentum. Specifically of note are what
    some technical analysts sometimes refer to as “accumulation days” when the market
    is strong, but the market falls today on rising volume (although there are so
    many widespread opinions on volume it is better to look at results). In this particular
    setup, the market has risen an incredible 87% of the time with an average daily
    return of .5% over the last 3 months–although this has only occured 15 times.
    Another highly bullish configuration has been when the 5-day ROC of SPY volume
    was higher, but today volume was lower than yesterday– this led to nearly 88%
    winners with an even higher gain per trade of .62%. Screening for all three (higher
    5-day ROC SPY volume, lower volume today and a lower close)  produced far too
    few instances to draw conclusions but they were both winners with an average gain
    of 1.41%. The most bearish configuration has been when 5-day ROC of SPY volume
    has fallen, and today’s close has also fallen–only 8 occurences but in this bull
    market this situation has led to only 37.5% winners and a negative  average daily
    return of -.58%. Another more common situation worth considering is when both
    volume measures have fallen- both the 5-day, and today’s volume versus yesterday.
    This happened 21 times in the last 60 days, and only 48% were winners with the
    market losing -.22% in these instances.

    to be predictable momentum in market behavior over time. What is working over
    the last 3 months is generally a little early to draw strong conclusions, but
    it is at the point of becoming relevant especially when looking at next day returns
    that have more degrees of freedom versus longer-term strategies. In this case
    you  might want to consider the impact volume in the current market to help time
    trades–even if you are not trading the SPY. In a market that has shown tremendous
    bullish momentum, and has proven really tricky, this is one indicator that has
    provided some clarity–amazingly it has been able to predict when the market is
    likely to fall. Certainly, it has been a strong predictor of when it will rise.
