    and the April [VIX options](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20options)
    can no longer be traded, this seems like as good a time as any to mention a pure
    overnight volatility gamble: the VIX expiration [straddle](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/straddle).'

    and am certainly not recommending it, but there are some who love this type of
    trade.

- en: As outlined in the optionsXpress graphic below, the VIX is at 37.61 as I type
    this, just 0.11 above the 37.50 strike. In the example indicated in the graphic,
    selling 10 April VIX 37.50 calls and 10 April VIX 37.50 puts nets $1250\. If the
    VIX settles at tomorrow’s opening at 37.50, this is the maximum gain. As the profit
    and loss table shows, break even is at 36.25 and 38.75\. A loss comparable to
    the maximum profit of $1250 will be realized at 35.00 and 40.00\. If the VIX settles
    below 35.00 or above 40.00, then the losses will be even more significant. For
    long positions, the numbers are reversed.

    releases before the open tomorrow, including the March CPI data, March industrial
    production and capacity utilization, and several others. In addition, there is
    a fairly large slate of earnings due out after the close today and before the
    open tomorrow. In short, a lot can happen overnight.

    straddle is one way to put that idea into action.

    to make this trade will likely be doing so several weeks before expiration and
    close the position out prior to the last trading day...but there are others like
    like the overnight approach.
