## ASX and Emulex

Asia Trading provides offers some [insight](http://asiaetrading.com/the-australian-securities-exchange-selects-emulex-for-trade-latency-monitoring-and-network-troubleshooting/) into ASX selection of [Emulex](http://blog.endace.com/2013/06/delivering-near-real-time-network-and-trade-flow-monitoring-for-the-australian-securities-exchange/) for trading latency monitoring.  I’m curious if anyone has done a comparison between [Velocimetrics](http://www.velocimetrics.com/) and other products such as [Optier](https://optier.com/) etc
