    algo. It is by far the worst DB I have every worked with in terms of reliability
    and functionality. The one thing it does have going for it is that it is fast.

    over on simple operations, has a largely unintelligable language Q (a dialect
    of APL) that noone cares for, and has next to nothing in the way of support from
    the vendor, be my guest.

    a a bunch of binary files, one for each timeseries per day.
