This Thursday, we will see the Retail Sales report. Despite the drop in energy prices, retail sales haven't exactly been setting records. The Street estimate for MoM Core Retail Sales (ex-autos) is -0.4%.

On the other hand, retailing stocks have been in a solid relative uptrend when compared to the market. The bottom panel shows the relative performance of the Leisure and Entertainment group, which seems to be starting to roll over.

> 
> What’s more, the number of miles Americans drive annually was on track to surpass 3 trillion in 2014 for the first time since a record 3.04 trillion in 2007 — the year before the Great Recession started. (The government estimates miles driven via thousands of electronic sensors on main public roads.)

As gasoline prices have ticked up in the last couple of weeks (chart via Bespoke), what will happen to consumer confidence, which will get released on Friday?

As the above chart of relative performance of retailing stocks indicates, expectations are rising for consumer spending. Watch this space for possible disappointment.
