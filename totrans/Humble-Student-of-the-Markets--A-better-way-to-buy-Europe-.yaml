    based less on external borrowing and more on internal competitiveness. Indeed,
    according to harmonised competitiveness indicators based on unit labour costs
    have all registered significant improvements since 1999, Ireland (-19% since 1999),
    Spain (-9.5%), Greece (-9%), and Portugal (-6.6%). The loss of competitiveness
    accumulated until 2007 has been totally offset since the beginning of the crisis.
    As a consequence, the EU Commission forecast for this year is that all stressed
    countries will show a surplus on current account with the exception of Greece
    with a deficit of just 1.1 % of GDP.

    contraction of 3pc a year is eroding the tax base, causing Lisbon to miss deficit
    targets. A new working paper by the Bank of Portugal explains why it has gone
    wrong. The fiscal multiplier is “twice as large as normal”, or 2.0, in small open
    economies during crisis times.

    has thrown in the towel. He blames the fainthearted for refusing to slash with
    greater vigour. Needless to say, he still refuses to accept that a strategy of
    wage cuts and deflation in a country with total debt of 370pc of GDP was always
    likely to fail.

    its Eurozone counterparts until the adjustments after Lehman Crisis and the EWU/FEZ
    ratio has been in a relative uptrend ever since. As the ratio has retreated to
    test the relative uptrend line, it may be a good entry point for this trade.
