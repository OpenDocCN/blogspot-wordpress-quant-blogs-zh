    there have been numerous objections of Trump's Executive Orders. I'll spare you
    the details of the protests and demonstrations, particularly from the Left. What
    stood out were the objections from the Right and within the GOP. As an example,

    big splashy pronouncements such as announcing a wall that he would force Mexico
    to pay for, even as the Mexican foreign minister held talks with American officials
    in Washington. Not by the quiet, but no less dangerous bureaucratic orders, such
    as kicking the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff out of meetings of the Principals’
    Committee, the senior foreign-policy decision-making group below the president,
    while inserting his chief ideologist, Steve Bannon, into them. Many conservative
    foreign-policy and national-security experts saw the dangers last spring and summer,
    which is why we signed letters denouncing not Trump’s policies but his temperament;
    not his program but his character.

    get better. It will get worse, as power intoxicates Trump and those around him.
    It will probably end in calamity—substantial domestic protest and violence, a
    breakdown of international economic relationships, the collapse of major alliances,
    or perhaps one or more new wars (even with China) on top of the ones we already
    have. It will not be surprising in the slightest if his term ends not in four
    or in eight years, but sooner, with impeachment or removal under the 25th Amendment.
    The sooner Americans get used to these likelihoods, the better.

    Hayek -- and rightly so. More clearly than anyone else, Hayek elaborated the case
    against government planning and collectivism, and mounted a vigorous argument
    for free markets. As it turns out, Hayek simultaneously identified a serious problem
    with the political creed of President-elect Donald Trump.

    Hayek distinguished between formal rules, which are indispensable, and mere “commands,”
    which create a world of trouble, because they are a recipe for arbitrariness.
    When formal rules are in place, “the coercive power of the state can be used only
    for cases defined in advance by law and in such a way that it can be foreseen
    how it will be used.”

    to people who are not and cannot be known by the rule-makers -- and they apply
    in situations that public officials cannot foresee.

    what to do. (Think Hitler’s Germany, Stalin’s Soviet Union, Mao’s China, Castro’s
    Cuba.) They require the exercise of discretion on the spot. As examples, Hayek
    pointed to official decisions about “how many buses are to be run, which coal
    mines are to operate, or at what prices shoes are to be sold.”
