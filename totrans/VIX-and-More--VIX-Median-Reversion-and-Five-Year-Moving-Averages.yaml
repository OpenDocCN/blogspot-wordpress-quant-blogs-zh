    necessarily assuming a normal distribution and statistics related to normal distributions
    when no such distribution or relevant statistical analysis exists.

    activity for me on Twitter.  In some Twitter conversations, we discussed the median
    VIX vs. the mean VIX and there was a request for a chart of a five-year moving
    average of the median VIX.  Since I have never seen such a chart – or any VIX
    median chart for that matter – I present below a chart of the five-year moving
    average of the median VIX, using data going back to 1990.

    VIX is 16.63.  For the full history of the VIX, going back to 1990, the lifetime
    median VIX is 17.84, 9.5% below the lifetime mean VIX of 19.71.  What does all
    this mean?  Mostly that one should be careful using statistics that are associated
    with a normal distribution when analyzing the VIX.  Perhaps more importantly,
    VIX traders should also think at least as much about median reversion as mean
    reversion.
