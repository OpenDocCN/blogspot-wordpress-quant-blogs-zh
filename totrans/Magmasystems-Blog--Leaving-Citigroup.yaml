- en: You may have noticed that this blog has been very quiet lately. The reason is
    because I have resigned from Citigroup (this is most likely the first and only
    time that I will mention my employer by name on this blog). I will be joining
    one of the premier names in Capital Markets, helping them bootstrap new businesses,
    build technology infrastructure, and building great teams.

    me over the past three years.

- en: The new company that I am joining is not very permissive of blogging. As a result,
    my blogging here will be cut back dramatically. I don't want to give anyone any
    hints about the technologies that we are using or the technologies that we are
    considering. However, my pursuit of new and interesting technologies to solve
    business problems will continue.
