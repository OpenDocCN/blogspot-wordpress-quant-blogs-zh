# Timely Portfolio: R Plotting Financial Time Series

> 来源：[http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2013/06/r-plotting-financial-time-series.html#0001-01-01](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2013/06/r-plotting-financial-time-series.html#0001-01-01)

In my little world of finance, data almost always is a time series.  Through both quiet iteration and significant revolutions, the volunteers of R have made analyzing and charting time series pleasant.  As a mini-tribute to all those who have helped, I wanted to write a short history of R time series plotting, specifically focusing on financial time series.  I have embedded below, but it will look much better if you go to [Github pages version](http://timelyportfolio.github.io/rCharts_time_series/history.html).
