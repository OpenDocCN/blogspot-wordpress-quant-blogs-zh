# Falkenblog: Men are Pigs

> 来源：[http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2009/06/men-are-pigs.html#0001-01-01](http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2009/06/men-are-pigs.html#0001-01-01)

From a

[Harvard study](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8089508.stm)

:

> For example, it found that men had 15% more followers than women despite there being slightly more females users of Twitter than males.
> 
> It also showed that an average man was almost twice as likely to follow another man than a woman, despite the reverse being true on other social networks.
> 
> "The sort of content that drives men to look at women on other social networks does not exist on Twitter," said Mr Heil.
> 
> "By that I mean pictures, extended articles and biographical information."

Reading between the lines, if you are a woman with something to say, it helps to be attractive and post pics.

No one said life is fair.
