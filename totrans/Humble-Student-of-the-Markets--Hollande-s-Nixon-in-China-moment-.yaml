    embrace more-radical steps in the race to save the euro while sounding a more
    conciliatory note on the plight of Germany’s troubled neighbors. Her newfound
    pragmatism, observers say, could prove decisive in resolving a debt crisis that

    launched last month by corporate and cultural foundations here and aimed at frugal
    German taxpayers who are increasingly skeptical about the price they are paying
    to save the euro. Her words also seemed to harbor a message for other Europeans
    worried about growing German authority. “We have it to thank for our peace, our
    prosperity and our good understanding with our neighbors.”
