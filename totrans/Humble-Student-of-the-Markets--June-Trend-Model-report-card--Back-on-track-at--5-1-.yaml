    there is no substitute for actual performance. As a proof of concept, I started
    to manage a small account that traded long, inverse and leveraged ETFs on the
    major US market averages and, on occasion, sector and industry ETFs. Trading decisions
    were based on Trend Model signals combined with some short-term sentiment indicators.
    The inception date of the account was September 30, 2013, For more details on

    good too be true. From some of the feedback that I had received, it was evident

    and bad weeks and bad months, and periodically even a bad year. A losing day/week/month
    is not an indictment against a trading plan. In fact, drawdowns are to be expected
    and a trader must learn to take them in stride without pulling the escape hatch
    whenever a position turns into a daily loser.

    The Calmar ratio is calculated by dividing the worst drawdown (month-ending basis)
    into the average annual rate of return for some measure of time. A rolling three-year
    period is the most frequent time measure for determining Calmar. A Calmar ratio
    of 2.0 is considered outstanding — 3.0 is world class. Some short gamma traders
    (naked options sellers) can generate Calmar ratios of 5.0 or even higher — that
    is, until they go broke, which they eventually will.

    annual ROR of 30% you will likely experience a worst-drawdown of 15% or greater
    (month-ending). Keep in mind that a month-ending worst drawdown of 15% probably
    equates to a week-ending worst drawdown of 20% or greater.

    three-year track record, but using the return from inception of 22.5%, that makes
    a Calmar, or a gain-to-pain, ratio of 1.5\. That's not bad in light of Brandt's
    comments.

    for about two months before beginning a volatile recovery. Trend following models

- en: To summarize, investment results this year have been challenging but continue
    to be promising for this model longer term. I am comfortable with attributing
    the recent return hiccup as a characteristic of a difficult environment for this
    class of model, rather than anything fundamentally wrong with the modeling approach.
