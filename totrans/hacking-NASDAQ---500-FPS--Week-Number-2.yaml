    warming up the tiers, a few test laps, getting a feel for at what speed/rpm to
    shift gears. how it corners and most importantly how fast does it go and how fast
    can it stop.

    is there`s this completely irrational fear, similar to the fear of talking to
    that girl... or hitting that asshole on the nose...  and now a new addition...
     putting 100shrs at the BBO. Theres no logical explanation for it. Sure, she might
    ignore you, or you might get some nasty bruise or you might get executed with
    a 100shrs of an incredibly liquid stock, all 3 of which are of little consequence.'

    its not so bad, the irrational fear dissipates and the analytical part of your
    brain takes over from more primal/emotional.
