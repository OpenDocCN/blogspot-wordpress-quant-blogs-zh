- en: It should come as no surprise that a network of journalists who have never traded
    a share, a currency, an option, or a future in their lives repeatedly cite and
    support the "research" of Nanex/Themis.  I overheard a segment this morning regarding
    the "time arbitrage" between Chicago and NYC, and citing "investigative work"
    by the CEO of Nanex, they attempt to explain an arbitrage conducted at "the speed
    of light."

    buying 260,000 shares of SPY within the same millisecond - somehow creating an
    arbitrage.  How two simultaneous purchases of the same vehicle creates an arbitrage
    opportunity, I have no idea.
