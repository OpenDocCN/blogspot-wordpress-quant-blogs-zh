# Falkenblog: Krugman's Work

> 来源：[http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2008/10/krugmans-work.html#0001-01-01](http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2008/10/krugmans-work.html#0001-01-01)

Paul Krugman won the Nobel, and I remember his work was essential reading for those in the Industrial Organization series. But I never encountered it classes I took in macro, finance or information theory. So, I don't have a sense to which they are clever or useful, by actually working them through and comparing them to a literature.
