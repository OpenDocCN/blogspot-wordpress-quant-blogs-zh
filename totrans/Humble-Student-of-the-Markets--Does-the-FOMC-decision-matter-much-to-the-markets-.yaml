    The Wall Street Journal predicted the Fed’s first rate increase would come at
    the Sept. 16-17 policy meeting. While a plurality picked September, a majority
    predicted liftoff would arrive at some later meeting. About 9.5% said the Fed
    would lift off in October, while 35% said the first rate increase would come in
    December and 9.5% said the central bank would wait until 2016.

    riskier assets—junk bonds and investment-grade corporate bonds—would get hit,
    and stocks, too. There’s a chance longer term Treasuries might hold up better
    since they are priced off inflation expectations, which would tumble. However,
    yields are already low, so don’t bet on it. “There would be few places to hide,”
    Valeri says.

    sees risk. “The Treasury market is not well-positioned for rising short-term rates,”
    he says, noting that Treasuries saw weak bids in August even when the stock market
    was tanking and fears that China would spark global recession were highest. “That
    could be a warning that if there were some selling pressure, the market reaction
    might be more adverse than expected,” he says.

    binary, where a delay is bullish and a hike is bearish. The market reaction to
    a dovish hike and a hawkish pass are likely not that different. I therefore believe
    that the odds favor a modest bullish tilt going into the FOMC interest rate announcement.
