    The Wall Street Journal predicted the Fed’s first rate increase would come at
    the Sept. 16-17 policy meeting. While a plurality picked September, a majority
    predicted liftoff would arrive at some later meeting. About 9.5% said the Fed
    would lift off in October, while 35% said the first rate increase would come in
    December and 9.5% said the central bank would wait until 2016.

    riskier assets—junk bonds and investment-grade corporate bonds—would get hit,
    and stocks, too. There’s a chance longer term Treasuries might hold up better
    since they are priced off inflation expectations, which would tumble. However,
    yields are already low, so don’t bet on it. “There would be few places to hide,”
    Valeri says.

    sees risk. “The Treasury market is not well-positioned for rising short-term rates,”
    he says, noting that Treasuries saw weak bids in August even when the stock market
    was tanking and fears that China would spark global recession were highest. “That
    could be a warning that if there were some selling pressure, the market reaction
    might be more adverse than expected,” he says.

- en: Regardless of what the FOMC decides, the stock market implications are not necessarily
    binary, where a delay is bullish and a hike is bearish. The market reaction to
    a dovish hike and a hawkish pass are likely not that different. I therefore believe
    that the odds favor a modest bullish tilt going into the FOMC interest rate announcement.

  zh: 无论FOMC做出何种决定，其对股市的影响并非必然是二元的，即延迟加息是看涨的，而加息是看跌的。市场对温和加息和鹰派维持利率不变的反应可能并没有太大不同。因此，我认为在FOMC利率公告之前，看涨的倾向可能性较大。
