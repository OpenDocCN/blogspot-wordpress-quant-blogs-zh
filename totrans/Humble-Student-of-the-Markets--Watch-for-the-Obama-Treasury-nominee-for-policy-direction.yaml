    to the presidency of South Africa. During the election people stood in line for
    hours to vote. There was no violence. People were just happy to be enfranchised.
    Foreign election observers came away with tears in their eyes. He had magnanimously

    that we are here to build a new nation. Yet South Africa faced many economic challenges
    that it was not able to solve.
