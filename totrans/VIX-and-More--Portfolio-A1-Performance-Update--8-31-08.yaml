    Portfolio A1, which I launched live on the blog a little over 1 ½ years ago.

- en: The chart below shows the equity curve and some summary performance statistics
    for Portfolio A1 since the equities only (no ETFs or options), long only portfolio
    was created on February 16, 2007.  During the 18 ½ months since inception, Portfolio
    A1 has posted a cumulative return (exclusive of dividends) of 4.2%, while the
    benchmark S&P 500 index has declined 11.9%.  This adds up to a net performance
    of +16.1% for the portfolio vs. the benchmark.

    ENGlobal ([ENG](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=eng)); Cash America ([CSH](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=csh));
    EnerSys ([ENS](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=ens)); and Centene ([CNC](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=cnc)).
    For the record, Portfolio A1 also shares some common ancestry and has a stock
    ranking system that is similar to the VIX and More Focus Aggressive Trader model
    portfolio – one of the four model portfolios that I update transaction by transaction
    for the VIX and More [subscriber newsletter](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/subscriber%20newsletter).'
