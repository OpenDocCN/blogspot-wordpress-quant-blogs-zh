    that StreamInsight is appropriate for a real-time market risk solution. Unfortunately
    the video doesn‚Äôt talk about a complete Market Risk architecture, but then I suppose
    the video is only 4:43 long. I would have been nice to see if Microsoft is pushing
    HPC for the cashflow/PV calculations, leveraging StreamInsight to presumable feed
    SQL Server R2\. I wonder if Microsoft are pushing WPF or Silverlight for a Market
    Risk viewer?

    reasons. From what I can see on the PowerPivot site the application deals with
    snaps shots of data ‚Äì load, slice dice. What would actually be cooler (maybe I‚Äôve
    missed this feature in the documentation) is the ability to [subscribe](http://blogs.adatis.co.uk/blogs/sachatomey/archive/2009/10/20/creating-a-custom-gemini-powerpivot-data-feed-method-1-ado-net-data-services.aspx)
    to real-time data. Basically I‚Äôd like to point PowerPivot at my Real-Time [Cube](http://business-intelligence.kdejonge.net/using-powerpivot-to-combine-cube-ssas-data-with-manual-data)
