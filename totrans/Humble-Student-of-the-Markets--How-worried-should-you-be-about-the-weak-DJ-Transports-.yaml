    focused on periods over the past 25 years that included big divergences. Schannep
    is the editor of a market-timing advisory service called TheDowTheory.com.

    subsequently dropped by less than 10%. But in the remaining five cases, the stock
    market’s eventual decline averaged 25.7%.

    similar to the current one, the market eventually fell more than the 10% threshold
    for a correction. If that turns out to be the case this time around, it would
    be the first correction since 2011.

- en: Even more ominous is that in five of the 14 cases, or more than a third of the
    total, the divergences presaged a full-scale bear market. In fact, Schannep points
    out that when the broad market hit its bull-market highs in 1990, 1998, 2000 and
    2007, the Dow Transports in each case had already turned down several months before.

- en: Notwithstanding the bearish analysis from Nautilis and Schannep, I would philosophically
    inclined to agree with the naysayers about the importance of the Transports. No
    indicator is perfect, particularly an indicator as old as the DJIA-DJTA link.
    Technical indicators have to be viewed as part of a mosaic and the analyst has
    to see what the big picture is telling him.

- en: The comparison of the DJTA with the DJIA is a well-known technique of looking
    for breadth confirmation of a move. So why all the hate? Good technical analysts
    need to consider the big picture on indicators like breadth. Even as the SPX achieved
    new highs on Thursday at Friday, indicators like RSI and % above the 50 dma remain
    range bound, indicating a lack of momentum. In addition, % on point and figure
    buys is in a downtrend showing a negative divergence.

  zh: 将道琼斯运输平均指数（DJTA）与道琼斯工业平均指数（DJIA）进行比较，是寻找广度确认移动的众所周知的技术。那么为什么会有这么多的负面情绪呢？优秀的技术分析师需要考虑广度方面的整体情况，即使标普500指数在周四和周五创下了新高，但像RSI和50日均线以上的百分比等指标仍然在区间内波动，表明缺乏动力。此外，点差买入百分比呈下降趋势，显示出负面背离。
