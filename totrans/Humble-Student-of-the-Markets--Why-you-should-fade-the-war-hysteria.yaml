    a geopolitical risk premium became embedded in the oil price. The surprise attack
    brought up memories of the Yom Kippur War 50 years ago, in which the armies of
    Egypt and Syria launched a simultaneous surprise attack on Yom Kippur in 1973
    that left Israel fighting for its existence. In the wake of that war, the Arab-producing
    states launched an oil embargo on the West which devastated growth. It’s no wonder
    oil prices popped this time.
