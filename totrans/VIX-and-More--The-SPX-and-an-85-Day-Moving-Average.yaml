    Critical Moving Average](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/11/chart-of-week-reverse-engineering.html),
    I talked about the importance of being able to “develop customized moving averages
    that circumscribe past price action in order to get a better understanding of
    how current forces acting on stock prices compare to past forces.”'

    support levels (at least retrospectively), I arrived at an 85 day moving average
    for the S&P 500 index as an excellent approximation of support during the March-October
    2009 period.

    below the 85 day MA on Friday and close above that level today. For now at least,
    an 85 day moving average is about as good a measure of support as one can find
    on the charts. In my next post, I will detail what I believe is a meaningful enhancement
    to the moving average approach.
