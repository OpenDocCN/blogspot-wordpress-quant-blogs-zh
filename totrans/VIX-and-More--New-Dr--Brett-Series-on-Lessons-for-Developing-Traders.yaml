    of time required to digest all the nuggets of wisdom it contains, that site is
    undoubtedly Brett Steenbarger’s [TraderFeed](http://traderfeed.blogspot.com/).
    Filled with insights that range from quantitative analysis and system development
    to what is arguably the best collection of content on the web in the realm of
    trader [psychology](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/psychology), TraderFeed
    continues to be – at least in my opinion – the top all-purpose investment blog
    on the web.

    Moves Markets](http://traderfeed.blogspot.com/2009/12/lessons-for-developing-traders-what.html)
    that he is “going to write about topics that no one told me about when I was learning
    the ropes,” I thought that instead of waiting until the series is finished to
    highlight it I would flag it now for anyone who is not already on the Steenbarger
    bandwagon.'

    been told (assuming I was smart enough to follow that advice) at the beginning
    of my trading career. The answers are personal ones, but I believe they capture
    insights that led to quantum advances in my trading:'

    of [behavioral finance](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/behavioral%20finance)
    and the associated decision-making pitfalls that investors should learn to avoid.
    Those who wish to get a better sense of how I see the learning process for developing
    traders may wish to investigate my [trader development stage model](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/trader%20development%20stage%20model).
