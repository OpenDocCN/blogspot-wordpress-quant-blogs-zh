    gap accompanying a breakout.  With yesterday’s breakout occurring along with an
    unfilled up gapI have revisited that study below.

- en: Now let’s look at instances where the 50-day high breakout was not accompanied
    by an unfilled gap.  Interestingly, the number of instances was nearly the same.
     This study also appeared in the 7/19/12 blog and is updated.

    are much less reliable over the short-term.

- en: Technicians will often use the term “breakaway gap”.  This suggests the gap
    occurs on the same day as a base breakout.  The idea is that the new high causes
    excitement and the gap leaves a good amount of people sidelined or stuck short.
     When it doesn’t immediately fill, it leads these people to chase and helps to
    propel the market even higher.
