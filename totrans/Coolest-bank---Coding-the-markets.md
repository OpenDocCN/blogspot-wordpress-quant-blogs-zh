## Coolest bank

### May 31, 2006

So who’s the coolest bank to work for these days ?

Back in the 90s it had to be Swiss Bank, now merged with [UBS](http://www.ubs.com). They were the first to dress down, the first to put flat screen on the trading floor, and they used [Next](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT_Computer) workstations. They used [Objective-C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C). They had also bought the O’Connor derivative shop in Chicago, and so owned the prediction technology developed by the [Prediction Company](http://www.predict.com/html/introduction.html). Read [the Predictors](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0805057560) for more on this.

More recently, [DrKW are setting out their stall](https://www.drkwrevolution.com/Default.aspx). Looks like they’ve gone very web 2.0, with social software and lots of [blogging](http://www.confusedofcalcutta.com/).
