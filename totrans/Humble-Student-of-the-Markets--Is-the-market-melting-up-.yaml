- en: The technical pattern is also starting to look like the melt-up and blow-off
    top that began in late 2017\. The SPX overran rising trend lines (twice) while
    shrugging off negative RSI divergences. In fact, neither the 5-day nor 14-day
    RSI flashed any warnings when the market finally topped out in January 2018\.
    Today, the index has rallied above one rising trend line. Compare the late 2017
    melt-up behavior with the orderly advance of mid-2018, which never significantly
    breached the uptrend line. and weakened as RSIs flashed negative divergences.
    Equally impressive is the NYSE new highs - new lows seen in the current advance.
