- en: I think Lesnar will destroy Couture in their fight this Saturday, because he
    has been working on his jujitsu, and plugging that deficiency makes him a really
    tough fighter. If he wins, the UFC will really get a marketing coup, so I'm sure
    the fix is in! Lastly, I just can't see how Couture's 45 year old body will handle
    the 31 year old, much stronger Lesnar.
