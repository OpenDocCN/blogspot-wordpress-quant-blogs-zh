# Maestro: Future CLR DSL Language? | Tales from a Trading Desk

> Êù•Ê∫êÔºö[https://mdavey.wordpress.com/2008/12/24/maestro-future-clr-dsl-language/#0001-01-01](https://mdavey.wordpress.com/2008/12/24/maestro-future-clr-dsl-language/#0001-01-01)

## Maestro: Future CLR DSL¬†Language?

This C9 [video](http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/Going+Deep/Maestro-A-Managed-Domain-Specific-Language-For-Concurrent-Programming/) shows how Microsoft is continuing to push the concurrent road using incubation project to identify future features for the .NET platform.

**Notes from the video:** Maestro is built on top of the CCR. The CLR is essentially patternless. Maestro provides isolation and co-ordination between components. A library approach for Maestro wouldn‚Äôt work due to the CLR being too general purpose.

The C9 concurrent video are excellent, the only thing missing is a transcript of each video üò¶
