- en: You have been posting the Livermore for well over a year, and thus far it has
    vastly underperformed its historical backtest. Obviously, one year doesn’t mean
    a whole lot in the grand scheme of things, but I can’t help noticing a steady
    decline in performance in the performance since 1998 (excluding 2009). I wonder
    if you have put much thought into this?

    market where stocks tend to move in unison, potentially due to the growing popularity
    of ETFs

    edge now than it was 10 years ago

    extended periods
