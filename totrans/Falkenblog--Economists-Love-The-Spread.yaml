    so wide and particular your opponents are unable to rebut them all because 1)
    they have day jobs and 2) they have limited space or time to address them in any
    particular forum.  A champion spreader is Noam Chomsky, who selectively recites
    facts of world history from Indonesia, Russia, to El Salvadore and 200 places
    in between, which no one but a professional in

    economic subdiscipline precisely because it couldn't be easily refuted because
    those communist countries didn't have a free press and made up their production

    a good type of argument for this kind of thing. As it is doubtful that less than
    1% of his readership understands all the strengths and limitations of the model
    he presents, it makes for a great

    perfectly flexible wages (or some other mechanism for efficient labor contracting),
    but assumes monopolistic competition in goods markets, and sticky prices that
    are adjusted at random intervals in the way assumed by Calvo (1983), so that deflation
    has real effects.

    utility function Real balances are included in the utility function, following
    Sidrauski (1967) and Brock (1974, 1975), as a proxy for the services that money
    balances provide in facilitating transactions.

    has been available to thousand smart economists trying to forecast the macroeconomy.
    If some metric of monopolistic competition, sticky prices, inflation, and real
    balances, predicted future investment and consumption, we would know it because
    there''s a model that targets these variables directly, and whether a parameter
    is 7 or -0.3 is simple enough to change after the fact: if some parameterization
    worked, the model could rationalize it. There isn''t such a model, as evidenced
    by the fact that all recessions have surprised macro economists in real time.'

    that's really unimpressive, and reflects the degrees of freedom available relative
    to the target variables of quarterly GDP aggregates. It's like finding a trading
    rule for last year's daily S&P moves.

    than the infamous Laffer curve, which while true at extremes and useful for some
    intuition, says very little about your average policy change and intermediate
    forecasts. Outsiders can't critique such models directly, but they can say, "what
    did this model say in 2007?  In early 2009?"  That is, not what does the model
    now say about 2008 given 2007 data, but what did it actually say in 2007?
