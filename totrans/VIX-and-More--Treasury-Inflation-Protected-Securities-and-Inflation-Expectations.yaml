    now it seems any network or blog can find enough economists to support either
    scenario as a grave concern for the economy.

- en: In times of confusion, I like to take my cues from the markets. This time around
    I am talking about the future inflation rate expectations that can be derived
    from Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, more commonly known as [TIPS](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TIPS).
    Using the CPI as an inflationary benchmark, TIPS coupon payments and the underlying
    principal are automatically adjusted to account for inflation. With a couple of
    assumptions to mitigate a liquidity premium and inflation-risk premium, a market
    assessment of inflationary expectations can be derived from the difference in
    yield between nominal treasury notes and TIPS, which is exactly what the graph
    below shows.

- en: Based on the TIPS yield differential analysis, it appears as if inflationary
    expectations peaked in either late February or late June and have been steadily
    trending lower over the course of the past two months, to the point that current
    inflationary expectations are at levels not seen in at least ten months.
