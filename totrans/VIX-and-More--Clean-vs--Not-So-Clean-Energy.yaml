- en: While I have not mentioned it much on the blog, one of my favorite sectors to
    invest in is the energy sector. When it comes to energy ETFs, the 800 pound gorilla
    is [XLE](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLE), the energy select sector
    SPDR that trades over 20 million shares on a typical day. XLE’s holdings are heavily
    tilted toward the major integrated oil companies, with Exxon Mobil ([XOM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XOM))
    and Chevron ([CVX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/CVX)) accounting
    for slightly more the 1/3 of the ETFs holdings, followed by ConocoPhillips ([COP](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/COP)),
    Schlumberger ([SLB](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SLB)), Occidental
    Petroleum ([OXY](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/OXY)), etc.

    in the energy space is getting even more interesting. XLE is up this morning,
    as are the popular oil services ETF, [OIH](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/OIH)
    (the top five holdings favor drillers and include [RIG](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/RIG),
    [SLB](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SLB), [DO](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/DO),
    [BHI](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/BHI) and [NE](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/NE))
    and the exploration and production ETF, [XOP](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XOP)
    (top five holdings are [XEC](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XEC),
    [PXD](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/PXD), [EAC](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EAC),
    [INT](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/INT) and [HK](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/HK).)

    best known of these and certainly the most popular is PowerShares WilderHill Clean
    Energy ([PBW](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/PBW)), whose largest
    holdings include a healthy dose of solar companies (top five holdings are [FSYS](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/FSYS),
    [VLNC](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VLNC), [SOLR](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SOLR),
    [ESLR](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/ESLR), [SOL](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SOL).)
    Among the more interesting alternatives is a sibling ETF, PowerShares WilderHill
    Progressive Energy ([PUW](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/PUW)), which
    places more emphasis on energy efficiency and nuclear power and has a list of
    top holdings which includes MX.TO, [ES](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/ES),
    [PX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/PX), [USU](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/USU)
    and CCO.TO. For a solar-only ETF play, Claymore/MAC Global Solar Energy ([TAN](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TAN))
    is an excellent bet. Note that many of the holdings of TAN are not traded on U.S.
    exchanges. The current top five holdings are MBTN.SW, [FSLR](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/FSLR),
    S92.BE, CTN.DU and SWV.BE. Also in the top ten holdings are two Chinese solar
    companies whose ADRs are available in the U.S.: [STP](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/STP)
    and [TSL](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TSL).'

    ETF, PBW and have included a ratio of PBW to XLE in order to get a sense of the
    relative performance of clean energy with respect to the broad energy sector.
    While PBW has pulled back with the broader market during the past three weeks,
    it has continued to perform strongly against the broad energy sector ETF. As the
    ratio chart hints at, pairs trades involving clean energy ETFs such as PBW, PUW
    and TAN vs. XLE, XOP and OIH are one way to play the Washington energy legislation
    game going forward.
