    While Bellamy and Piketty provide rich seams of ideas to mine, there is no prospect

    simply reject a graft of European-style social democracy. It’s pointless for progressives
    to get frustrated about this. ***Attachment to the ideal of equal opportunity
    is not a blind spot in the vision of voters. Americans do have strong egalitarian
    instincts, but they go hand-in-hand with a fierce commitment to individualism.
    The ideal of merit-fueled mobility is a fixed feature of American politics and
    ideology. It comes, almost literally, with the territory. Even if it were possible
    to retire the Alger myth, it would be a mistake. The national commitment to the
    principles of natural equality, opportunity, and upward mobility is an American
    strength. Only a politics that goes with this American grain stands any chance

    and unapologetic capitalist. I have founded, co-founded and funded more than 30
    companies across a range of industries—from itsy-bitsy ones like the night club
    I started in my 20s to giant ones like Amazon.com, for which I was the first nonfamily
    investor. Then I founded aQuantive, an Internet advertising company that was sold
    to Microsoft in 2007 for $6.4 billion. In cash. My friends and I own a bank. I
    tell you all this to demonstrate that in many ways I’m no different from you.
    Like you, I have a broad perspective on business and capitalism. And also like
    you, I have been rewarded obscenely for my success, with a life that the other
    99.99 percent of Americans can’t even imagine. Multiple homes, my own plane, etc.,
    etc. You know what I’m talking about. In 1992, I was selling pillows made by my
    family’s business, Pacific Coast Feather Co., to retail stores across the country,
    and the Internet was a clunky novelty to which one hooked up with a loud squawk
    at 300 baud. But I saw pretty quickly, even back then, that many of my customers,
    the big department store chains, were already doomed. I knew that as soon as the
    Internet became fast and trustworthy enough—and that time wasn’t far off—people
    were going to shop online like crazy. Goodbye, Caldor. And Filene’s. And Borders.
    And on and on.

    the strategic part of my success. The lucky part was that I had two friends, both
    immensely talented, who also saw a lot of potential in the web. One was a guy
    you’ve probably never heard of named Jeff Tauber, and the other was a fellow named
    Jeff Bezos. I was so excited by the potential of the web that I told both Jeffs
    that I wanted to invest in whatever they launched, big time. It just happened
    that the second Jeff—Bezos—called me back first to take up my investment offer.
    So I helped underwrite his tiny start-up bookseller. The other Jeff started a
    web department store called Cybershop, but at a time when trust in Internet sales
    was still low, it was too early for his high-end online idea; people just weren’t
    yet ready to buy expensive goods without personally checking them out (unlike
    a basic commodity like books, which don’t vary in quality—Bezos’ great insight).
    Cybershop didn’t make it, just another dot-com bust. Amazon did somewhat better.
    Now I own a very large yacht.
