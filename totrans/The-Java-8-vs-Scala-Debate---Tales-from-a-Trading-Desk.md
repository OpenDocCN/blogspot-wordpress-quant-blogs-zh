## The Java 8 vs Scala Debate

I’ve heard the Java 8 vs Scala [debate](http://www.infoq.com/articles/java-8-vs-scala) in many quarters over the last time period.  Its a curious discussion, like so many technology camp discussions.  There’s the classic view of feature [comparison](http://www.infoq.com/articles/java-8-vs-scala), coupled with the enterprise [language](http://jazzy.id.au/default/2013/03/28/java_8_lambdas_the_missing_link_to_moving_away_from_java.html) views of the world, and we might as well throw in the long standing imperative to functional switch club.  Scala uptake in the last 1-2 years has increase from where I sit in the financial world.  I don’t see Java 8 slowing this uptake, but it will aid the Joe Average Java developer in moving towards a functional programming road.
