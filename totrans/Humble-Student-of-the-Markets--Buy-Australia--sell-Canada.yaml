- en: What fascinated me about the chart was the degree of overvaluation exhibited
    by Canada, compared to Australia, which is trading at roughly its own historical
    average. The economies of Australia and Canada are similar in character. Both
    are resource based economies and about the same size. There is a minor difference
    as Australian resource industries tend to be more tilted toward the bulk commodities
    (i.e. coal and iron ore) whereas Canada has a higher weight in energy.

    any currency effects, of the iShares Australia ETF (EWA) and the iShares Canada
    ETF (EWC). This chart suggests that Australian and Canadian markets have tracked
    each other relatively closely since late 2002 and Australia is now at the bottom
    of a trading range relative to Canada.

    going long Australia and shorting Canada.

- en: The risk in the trade is seen in the recent steep selloff in the Australian
    market, attributable to the news of a super-tax of up to 40% being imposed on
    resource companies. Nevertheless, the trading range is indicative that the risk-reward
    ratio is positive for this pair trade and that most of the bad news is already
    in the Aussie market.

    How long would it take for budget constrained countries like Canada or Brazil
    to consider a form of super-tax on resource extraction companies? The 40% tax
    rate is awfully tempting and forms a very high ceiling rate from which to impose
    a new tax. Sympathy for resource extraction companies is low, especially in offshore
    oil extraction given BP’s environmental and public relations nightmare.

    While the news is bad right now, the Aussie market could rally should the government
    step back and ease up its tax proposal.

    as it has moved into tightening mode. By contrast, the Bank of Canada remains
    behind the curve in its monetary policy. What would happen to the Australia/Canada
    spread if and when the BoC tightens?

    I would be entering into such a trade with a target and pre-defined stop loss
    levels.
