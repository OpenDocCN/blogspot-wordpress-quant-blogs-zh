    writer Harry Dent, called “A Decade of Volatility: Demographics, Debt, and Deflation.”
    “There is,” Dent says, “***simply no way the Fed can win the battle it’s currently
    waging against deflation, because there are 76 million Baby Boomers who increasingly
    want to save, not spend.*** Old people don’t buy houses!”'

    families living in 4,000-square-foot McMansions. “About ten years from now,” he
    says, “what will they do? They’ll downsize to a 2,000-square-foot townhouse. What
    do they need all those bedrooms for? The kids are gone. They don’t visit anymore.
    Ten years after that, where are they? They’re in 200-square-foot nursing homes.
    Ten years later, where are they? They’re in a 20-square-foot grave plot. That’s
    the future of real estate. That’s why real estate has not bounced in Japan after
    21 years. That’s why it won’t bounce here in the U.S. either. For every young
    couple that gets married, has babies, and buys a house, there’s an older couple
    moving into a nursing home or dying.”

    the number of Americans who were 35 to 39 years old at midyear, as compiled by
    the U.S. Commerce Department, with the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index’s performance
    since 1980\. At least where equity valuations are concerned, the picture does
    not lend weight to Dent’s inevitable-inexorable-deflation thesis.

    the timeline of a boom in 35- to 39-year-olds “coincides perfectly with the time
    frame we’re guesstimating as the end of the secular bear market we’ve been in
    since 2000\. (They tend to run 17 years on average.)”

    focused instead on the Echo Boomers. Both the Geanakoplos paper and the SF Fed
    paper analyzed the interaction between the two generations. Geanakoplos concluded
    that a generational stock market bottom would occur about 2018, while the SF Fed
    put the timing of the bottom in 2021.
