    before the entire House of Representatives. The bills would offer protection for
    homeowners facing foreclosure. Lengthening the time before a house could be given
    a foreclosure notice, and the time of pre-foreclosure (the time between the foreclosure
    notice and when the bank repossesses the house).

    of houses were bought as investment properties, and people are walking away from
    them the second their value is less than the mortgage. More time won't get them
    to come back. With these new laws, the bank is hog-tied for up to 6 months from
    the last payment, before it can repossess the property. In the meantime,

    reduces property values. If you want to adversely affect neighborhood home values,
    put an abandoned property there for 6 months. The same governments that fret about
    abandoned homes and their collateral damage are simultaneously making it more

    rate. Who pays for lower recovery rates? Borrowers, specifically, poor borrowers.
    No one else. Banks lend money to make money, and they impute the expected probability
    of default, times the loss rate on the property (1- recovery rate), into future
    loans. If the

    so, a higher expected loss is put into new loans. And who does this hurt? Not
    the rich, they own their homes. Not those with good credit scores, because those
    whose default probabilities are less than 0.3% don't have much risk whether their
    home is worthless or not in such an improbable state (statistically). No, it is
    those with bad credit, the poor, those with lower levels of education, etc., who
    will pay, because if there's a 5% chance they will default, and the recovery rate
    is 25% lower because of new 'borrower friendly' legislation, that's a 1.25% increase
    the new, poor borrower will have to pay. As with so much economics, if you want
    to help the poor, this indirect route is not merely inefficient, it is counterproductive
    and unjust, because spillover effects from vacant properties are a pox on a community,
    and a new poor person shouldn't have to pay for a prior poor person's mistake.

    But the houses in default are spilled milk, and its best to have someone with
    skin in the game owning them ASAP. That would help poor borrowers, and poor neighborhoods,
    the most.
