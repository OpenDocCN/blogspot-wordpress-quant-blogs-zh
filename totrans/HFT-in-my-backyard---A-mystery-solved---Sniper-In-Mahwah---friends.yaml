    and prospective post should be online early next week). I visited again the [Ofcom](http://spectruminfo.ofcom.org.uk/spectrumInfo)
    website this morning to check data about the channel and I had a pleasant surprise.
    Two, in fact: 1) the UK regulator now gives more data than before about the frequency
    licences (the licence start date, the locations and a lot of technical details
    such as the antenna azimuth in degrees), it’s very helpful when you are doing
    a detective work about the microwave networks owned or used by some high-frequency
    traders in Europe – that said, my detective work is now finished, it was really
    fun but I have more serious matter to deal with; 2) but… since you can access
    more details about the UK frequency licences, I decided to go back to Dunkirk,
    England. Dunkirk is a small town with a historical tower where four microwave
    competitors are (Latent/Getco, MacKay Brothers, Optiver and Custom Connect). The
    reason is: the town is close to the straight line between Dover/Swingate and Basildon:'

    I focused on one of these competitors, Custom Connect (CC). By reading the [planning
    application](http://pa.midkent.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=documents&keyVal=ZZZVS1KJTA933) CC
    submitted to put dishes on the tower, I was amused to learn the firm installed
    them *before* the council gave his approval (no big deal). What was more surprising
    is the fact CC didn’t have any Ofcom licence to use the Dunkirk dishes (that’s
    why I jokingly called them “pirates”). Back in June 2013, CC had a [licence](http://spectruminfo.ofcom.org.uk/spectrumInfo/licences?googloc=(51.11184787658123%2c+1.2476778030395508)&unit=GHz&ne=(51.113100678590904%2c+1.2496733665466309)&service=Fixed+Links&code=301010&se=(51.11059504060753%2c+1.2496733665466309)&googoffset=0.1&nw=(51.113100678590904%2c+1.2456822395324707)&sw=(51.11059504060753%2c+1.2456822395324707)&groupKey=5&licenceNum=0956492&submit=Find%20licence)

    to have one path to go directly from Dover to Basildon. If it would be possible,
    why the other competitors need at least one tower between the two points? I know
    the Ofcom can grant licenses between two points without verifying the line of
    sight (that means: if you pay, you can get a licence for an impossible path, Ofcom
    doesn’t care). So, in June 2013 Custom Connect had no licence in Dunkirk, only
    a “suspicious” licence between Dover and Basildon, and the Dunkirk council granted the
    installation of the dishes there. But things have changed: ladies and gentlemen,
    now Custom Connect has a [licence](http://spectruminfo.ofcom.org.uk/spectrumInfo/licences?googloc=(51.29272707126008%2c+0.9791725873947144)&code=301010&se=(51.29246876676637%2c+0.9795856475830078)&googoffset=0.0&nw=(51.29298537430066%2c+0.9787595272064209)&unit=GHz&ne=(51.29298537430066%2c+0.9795856475830078)&service=Fixed+Links&sw=(51.29246876676637%2c+0.9787595272064209)&licenceNum=1016864&submit=Find%20licence)

    it mean CC runs one or two dishes in Dunkirk without licence? 3) There is more:

    us the firm asked for a 24 ghz frequency range. That is strange too. If you are
    a little bit familiar with the microwave frequencies used by the HFT competitors
    in Europe, you would know the 24ghz band is not the best choice at all. In short, with
    a 24ghz frequency range it’s very hard to achieve the 27 kilometers path needed
    betwen Dover and Dunkirk (I may be mistaken but 20 kilometers would be a great
    success) and I don’t even talk about the rain fade – in England… So the mystery
    is not fully resolved. Let’s move to Dover.'

    on November 21, 2014, Custom Connect was authorized to remove old dishes and install new
    ones in Dover. Before this new authorization, data coming from both French and
    English radio regulators said the Custom Connect route was Dover-Boulogne-Berthen.

    – at least among the different HFT routes. But one mystery remains: why CC doesn’t
    have any Ofcom licence to cross the channel from Dover to Boulogne as they already
    had dishes leading to Boulogne before moving to Berthen? In Berthen, Custom Connect
    has an [authorization](http://arcep.fr/uploads/tx_gsavis/13-0322.pdf) to use the
    8ghz frequency range but it’s legally impossible to use the 8ghz in England. So
