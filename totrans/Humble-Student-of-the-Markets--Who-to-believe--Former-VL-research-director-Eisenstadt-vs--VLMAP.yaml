    as it stood at the top of the bull market in October 2007, right before the worst

    even though the firm is not against anyone using it or any of the other data it
    produces. As far as I can tell, the VLMAP-based market-timing model originates
    in work done in the 1970s and 1980s by Daniel Seiver, a member of the economics
    faculty at California Polytechnic State University and editor of an investment
    advisory service called the PAD System Report.

    immediately become alarmed upon viewing the latest VLMAP reading. It stands at
    40%, which over four years is the equivalent to an annualized return of 8.8%.

    2009, how can investors reconcile these apparent contradictory bullish and bearish
    views based on similar data. Which interpretation of Value Line data should we
    believe?
