# Falkenblog: Characteristics vs. Factors

But a more tangible problem created by this theory is thinking that to get a certain return stream you should target the asset with the requisite factor mimicking beta, as LVOL has done.

[Daniel and Titman](http://thefinanceworks.net/Workshop/1002/private/3_Asset%20pricing/Articles/Daniel%20Titman%20on%20characteristics%20vs%20covariances%20JF%201997.pdf) documented that it was the characteristic, rather than the factor, that generated the value and size effects. They did an ingenious study in that they took all the small stocks, and then separated them into those stocks that were correlated with the statistical size factor Fama and French constructed, and those that weren’t. That is, of all the small stocks, some were merely small, and weren’t correlated with the size factor of Fama-French, and the same is true for some high book-to-market stocks.

Remember, in risk it is only the covariance of a stock to some factor that counts. Daniel and Titman found that the pure characteristic of being small, or having a high book-to-market ratio, was sufficient to generate the return anomaly, independent of their loading on the factor proxy. In the APT or SDF, the covariance in the return with something is what makes it risky. In practice, it is the mere characteristic that generates the return lift.

[Davis, Fama and French](http://robinswoodfinancial.com/documents/SSRN-id98678.pdf) shot back that their approach did work better on the early, smaller sample, and more survivorship biased 1933-to-1960 period, but that implies at best that size and value seem the essence of characteristics, not factors, over the more recent and better documented 1963-to-2000 period. Data in favor of Daniel and Titman's characteristics approach was found in France by [Souad Ajili](http://basepub.dauphine.fr/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/4169/cereg200305.pdf;jsessionid=657A8327FE4C3ECF62AFBEE3B9B6E173?sequence=1), and in Japan by [Daniel, Titman and Wei](http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/behfin/2001-05-11/daniel-titman.pdf).

In a similar vein, Todd Houge and Tim Loughran (2006) find mutual funds with the highest loadings on the value factor reported no return premium over the same 1975-to-2002 period, even though the value factor generated a 6.2 percent average annual return over the same period. Loading on the factor, per se, did not generate a return premium.

The standard equity groupings of size, value/growth, and now volatility, are best done directly, and not via an exposure to factor-mimicking portfolios.
