    all you’ll probably have come to the conclusion that its a useful and cool technology.
    What’s clear however is that I really want the ability for IObservable/IObserver
    to work inter-process – WCF .NET service layer to WPF client. I also want Silverlight
    [Local Message Receivers and Senders](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd833063(VS.95).aspx)
    to support Rx remoting, coupled with Azure Rx support. I wander if the Rx team
    have these items on their radar?
