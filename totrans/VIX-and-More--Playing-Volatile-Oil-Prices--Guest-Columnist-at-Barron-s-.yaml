    year I have been contributing to Barron’s and while I have generally tilted in
    the direction of volatility topics during this period, I always like to keep my
    thoughts topical, but with an unusual twist or two.

    the details surrounding it, I thought I would post a profit and loss graphic for
    the USO April 1x2 10.5/11.5 call backspread here as a companion to the Barron’s
    material.

    I think it is important for everyone to internalize backspreads, their P&L chart
    and some of the tweaks that can be made.  For instance, one can dramatically change
    probabilities and payoffs by modifying strikes (including making use of in-the-money
    strikes, for instance) and expirations, whereas the credit or debit for entering
    the trade is something that can be strongly influenced by adjusting the ratios
    to the likes of 2x3, 4x5, etc.

    spreads that are supplemented by the purchase an extra out-of-the-money option
    in the time-honored tradition of swinging for the fences with some of the profits
    from a spread trade.

    where you can make money should the underlying shares move sharply in either direction.
    Backspreads are intriguing in that they have limited risk, unlimited reward (in
    one direction), and can make money if the underlying moves either up or down.”
