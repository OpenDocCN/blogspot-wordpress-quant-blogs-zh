    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    signal. A bullish Trend Model signal that gets less bullish is a trading "sell"
    signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading
    "buy" signal. The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of
    the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. Past trading of
    the trading model has shown turnover rates of about 200% per month.

    still calls for one last blow-off top in stock prices before the equity party
    comes to a close. Current concerns about the Fed tightening into a weakening economy
    can be summarized by this chart of the Citigroup US Economic Surprise Index (ESI),
    which measures whether macro releases are beating or missing expectations. As
    the chart shows, ESI has been weak, and the 10-year yield has declined in sympathy.
    But ESI is already at very low levels. How much worse can the macro picture get
    before it rebounds?
