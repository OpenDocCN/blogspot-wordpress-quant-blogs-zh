[Ezra Klein](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/11/05/pundit-accountability-the-official-2012-election-prediction-thread/?wprss=rss_ezra-klein)

Notwithstanding the argument that polls are where people voice their opinions and prediction markets are where people put their money on the line, I was convinced of the prediction markets when in 1980, the polls showed a neck-and-neck race between Reagan and Carter, while the betting books in London showed about a two-thirds chance of a Reagan win. The rest is history.

As I write this, intrade is showing a 73.5% chance of four more years for Obama:

...and the key swing states breaking for Obama. If Romney can't even hold VA, then he is truly toast:
