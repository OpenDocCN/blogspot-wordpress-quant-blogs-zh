- en: One of the perils of system-building is the tendency to unintentionally overoptimize
    by playing/refining the parameters to fit history.  It starts with some harmless
    data playing but very possibly a system appears with some potential like that
    shown in [More St. Louis Fred Fun with National Financial Conditions](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2011/05/more-st-louis-fred-fun-with-national.html). 
    Then through some form of iterative adjusting something seemingly magical occurs.

    be something worthwhile, so I’m left with something to watch but not something
    on which I would risk my assets.

    idea with a limited dataset, and then extend the test to a much more encompassing
    out-of-sample dataset in terms of timeframes, other countries, or other asset
    classes.
