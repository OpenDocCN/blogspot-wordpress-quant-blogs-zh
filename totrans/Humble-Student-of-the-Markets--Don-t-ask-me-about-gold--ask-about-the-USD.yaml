- en: The market gods must be angry. Just as a goldbug predicted the demise of the
    US Dollar (and therefore the rise of gold) as of September 30, 2016 at 4pm ET,
    the USD rallied and gold cratered on Tuesday. The technical damage to gold was
    extensive, as it broke a key support level at 1300, though it did stabilize today.

    reply has always been the same. Don`t ask me about gold, ask about the US Dollar.
    Consider this chart of stated gold reserves. Assuming that the conspiracy theorists
    are wrong and the United States has all the gold it says it has, the market value
    of US gold reserves at $1300 per oz comes to roughly $340 billion. That`s not
    even a single year`s fiscal deficit!

- en: The global holdings of US Treasury paper dwarfs precious metal holdings. From
    a portfolio viewpoint, gold cannot be anything but a miniscule weight in the aggregate
    holdings of a global portfolio. As the gold price is inversely correlated to the
    greenback, it makes sense to analyze the more liquid asset class, namely the USD.
