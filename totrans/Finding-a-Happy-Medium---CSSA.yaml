    This is used in some form in both statistical applications and also in technical
    indicators. The most basic example is the mean– or the simple average of a set
    of data points. Other measures include the median– the middle or estimated middle
    value of the data set. There are those that like to debate the merits of each
    of the above measures, and of course those not mentioned. Personally, I think
    there is more value from looking at them all together in a blended fashion. Here
    is a way to calculate a central value that has a nice blend of the characteristics
    of each measure and tends to perform well on time series data:'

    strange outliers in the data. It is not perfect, but it tends to strike a good
    balance without having to resort to complex statistical methods. One could also
    blend in the interquantile or interquartile range as well (average of 80th and
    20th percentile and 75th and 25th percentile).

    or perhaps just use mutliple time interval measurements within the sample length.
    In this case that might mean days, weeks etc.
