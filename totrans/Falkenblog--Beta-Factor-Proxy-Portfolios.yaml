- en: .  One goes long high beta, short low beta, equal dollar weighted, equal sector
    weighted; the other is the opposite.  That is, they both are 'factor mimicking'
    portfolios on  beta, one the inverse of the other.   They use the top 1000 stocks
    in the Dow Jones US index as their universe, and pick the extremum 200 as their
    holdings for longs and shorts.  They don't trade much (~20k shares per day), and
    they might have some technical issues trying to target the top 200 each month,
    but I wish them well.

    like it.  That is, you miss a lot of the essence of the beta factor by neutralizing
    sector weightings.
