    and risk in the financial markets, including [VXEEM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXEEM)
    (CBOE Emerging Markets ETF Volatility Index); [DXJ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/DXJ)
    (WisdomTree Japan Hedged Equity Fund); and [DBV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/DBV)
    (PowerShares DB G10 Currency Harvest Fund). Part of my intent in focusing some
    attention on these largely under-the-radar indices and ETPs is to get more investors
    to think about risk more broadly across geographies and asset classes.

    equity-centric investors (and I know you are out there in larger numbers than
    you care to admit) is U.S. Treasuries. Of course U.S. Treasuries come in quite
    a few flavors, but the most important is probably the [U.S. 10-Year Treasury Note](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/10%20Year%20Treasury%20Note).
    In a display of impeccable timing, last month the CBOE and the CFE teamed up to
    [launch](http://ir.cboe.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=767019) a new volatility
    index based on this security: CBOE/CBOT 10-year U.S. Treasury Note Volatility
    Index ([VXTYN](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXTNY)).'

    10, 2013, which is the beginning of the historical data for VXTYN provided by
    the CBOE. Note that VXTYN only began rising in May and when hit has made a substantial
    move up, that has preceded a decline in stocks.

    of the correlation between VXTYN and the SPX. Here the relationship between the
    swings in correlation and subsequent moves in stocks may be easier to visualize.
    With less than months of historical data to draw on, I would caution against jumping
    to conclusions regarding correlation and causation, but at the very least I thought
    this graphic might provide some food for thought.

    the Treasury yield curve will get steeper or flatter? I highlighted these products
    back in 2010 in [Treasury Yield Curve ETNs and Volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/12/treasury-yield-curve-etfs-and.html);
    they are known formally as the iPath US Treasury Steepener ETN ([STPP](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/STPP))
    and the iPath US Treasury Flattener ETN ([FLAT](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/FLAT)).'
