# Humble Student of the Markets: A new breadth thrust buy signal?

**Mid-week market update:** Bulls were disappointed when the Zweig Breadth Thrust buy signal didn't achieve its objective when the ZBT Indicator failed to rise from oversold to overbought in 10 trading days. But they received a consolation when it reached a late overbought reading on Monday, which was two days late.

Do the two extra days matter? Is this a sort or, kind of, breadth thrust buy signal?
