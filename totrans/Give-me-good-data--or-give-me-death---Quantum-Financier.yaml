    is much more important to me as the data should only be written once but will
    definitely be read more than that. Please not that I did not intend portray this
    test a end-all discussion proof. But simply to look at what the options were and
    to evaluate their relative performance.Based on my preliminary results including
    but not limited to this analysis, I elected to store the data using the HDF format
    as it meets all my requirements and looks to be fairly fast, at least for medium
    size data. It should also enable the R homies to use it through the excellent
    rhdf5 library.

    be rather difficult to design a clean polymorphic API to access the data with
    such a structure but I can’t seem to find a better way.

    In addition to how you store and organize your data, I am very keen to hear how
    you would handle automating the creation of perpetual contracts without having
    to manually write a rule for the roll of each product. This has proven to be a
    tricky task for me and since I use those contracts a lot in my analysis I am looking
    for a good solution.

    data in-house.
