    of spiritual purity or nationalism. Just drink and enjoy.

    as the slowest buffalo. And when the herd is hunted, it is the slowest and weakest
    ones at the back that are killed first. This natural selection is good for the
    herd as a whole, because the general speed and health of the whole group keeps
    improving by the regular killing of the weakest members. In much the same way,
    the human brain can only operate as fast as the slowest brain cells. Now, as we
    know, excessive intake of alcohol kills brain cells. But naturally, it attacks
    the slowest and weakest brain cells first. In this way, regular consumption of
    beer eliminates the weaker brain cells, making the brain a faster and more efficient
    machine And that, Norm, is why you always feel smarter after a few beers.
