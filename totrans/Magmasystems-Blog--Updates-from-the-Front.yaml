- en: It has been difficult for me to get the proper motivation to blog. These past
    few weeks have been like a punch to the gut of anyone who is working in the financial
    services industry. Over the past few weeks, we have seen friends, colleagues and
    relationships dissolve, as the capital markets sector has undergone a painful
    consolidation. And as managers, it has been especially painful to deliver bad
    news to some of the very hard workers who we have collaborated with over the past
    several years.

    The capital markets sector is not the be-all and end-all in jobs, and there are
    plenty of opportunities out there for good technical people. As I have said before
    here ... Always Be Coding. Keep your technical skills sharp. Get out of your offices,
    read blogs, go to MeetUps, start to code that great new app.

    of smoke and turning them into an application which we hope will signal a new
    class of applications in my firm for capturing, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing
    real-time data flows.

    CEP team. We have given Coral8 much deserved grief at times, but we are confident
    that with the new technical management, they will deliver some great things to
    us in 2009.

- en: On a personal note, in addition to heading up the CEP team, I have just taken
    over the role of Chief Architect and Chief Strategist for Equities (a title that
    reads better than it is), and I have a new team reporting into me. I have taken
    over the role of my former boss, but you won't find any gala press releases that
    trumpet this appointment.

    application tied into CEP? No, not really.

- en: The title of Chief Architect means a lot of different things in a lot of different
    companies. In my company, it means dividing my time into interesting things (engaging
    new vendors and technologies, doing POC's, and trying to convince the business
    to come up with the budget to follow through on the more worthwhile POC's), and
    more mundane things (like doing roadmaps, pursuing system retirements, trying
    to consolidate various efforts, etc). It also means hobnobbing with my fellow
    wizards in the other divisions (Fixed Income, Munis, Transaction Services, Retail
    Banking) and trying to overcome the traditional silos to come up with consolidated
    efforts and cost savings in these difficult times. I dare say that the words "Process
    Re-engineering" and "Cost Savings" are a lot more important than "Revenue Building"
    in these times.

- en: It also means that I need to take a sobering look at Microsoft technologies.
    One of the reasons I was hired into my company was to help the former Chief Architect
    push Microsoft technologies throughout my firm. However, I like to think that
    I will not be a shill for any company. Microsoft will have to prove themselves
    to be worthy alongside the reams of Java infrastructure that we employ. I would
    also like to think that I can use my new powers for good instead of evil, and
    that I will be able to push Microsoft to pay more attention to the capital markets
    sector.

    Lehman, and WAMU would be gone, and GS and Morgan Stanley would be turned into
    bank holding companies?

- en: I have no idea what 2009 will bring. All of the news reports indicate that 2009
    will be as rough as 2008\. But we all need to stay focused so that, when we come
    out of the muck and mire in (hopefully) 2010, we can all hit the ground running.
