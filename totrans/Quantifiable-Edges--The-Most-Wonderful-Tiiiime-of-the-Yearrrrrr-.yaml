    week of the year for the SPX. The positive seasonality actually has persisted
    for up to 3 weeks. I demonstrated this last year in the 12/14/09 blog. I’ve updated
    that study below to include 2009 stats.

    the week before rallying into year-end.

    blog is an example of an active bearish study.  This one certainly favors the
    bulls.
