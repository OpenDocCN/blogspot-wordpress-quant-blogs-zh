- en: For example, in 1995, credit card companies all fell over themselves to lend
    to anyone because the margins were so large. For a FICO score of, say, 500, these
    guys didn't default at such a bad rate compared to how much they were paying (people
    with really low credit scores aren't smart enough to know you should pay off your
    21% credit card balance before getting a new truck). But the error was, this set
    of low credit people had other things going for them, and that's how they qualified
    for their loans. Thus, if you had a 500 FICO and got a consumer loan, there was
    probably other information relevant to you getting the loan, that mitigated your
    risk. A univariate analysis that made a 500 FICO look good was therefore biased,
    so when the companies all targeted them directly, there was a big increase in
    losses for that cohort (interestingly, during that debacle, the cash flow was
    still positive--credit cards make tons of money for their issuers).

  zh: 例如，1995年，信用卡公司争相向任何人放贷，因为利润率很高。例如，对于500分的FICO评分，这些人的违约率并不比他们支付的金额高（那些信用评分很低的人并不聪明，不知道在购买新卡车前应该先偿还21%的信用卡余额）。但错误在于，这组信用较差的人还有其他原因让他们能够拿到贷款。因此，如果你的FICO评分是500分，并且获得了消费贷款，你获得贷款的另一项相关信息可能会减轻你的风险。一个单变量分析让500分的FICO评分看起来不错，因此当各公司直接将他们作为目标客户时，这个队列的损失大幅增加了（有趣的是，在那场灾难期间，现金流仍然是正的--信用卡为其发布者创造了大量利润）。
- en: Similarly, consumer credit has a distinctive loss curve, as in the first few
    months, there is little default because most people can pay that, but then they
    get sloppy or experience a set back, and they default. So losses start out low,
    increase in the first 36-48 months, then flatten out as all the riff-raff has
    been washed out. Thus, the vintage, or time since origination, is important.

  zh: 同样，消费信贷具有特殊的损失曲线，例如，在最初的几个月，因为大多数人能还款，所以几乎没有人违约，但后来他们变得马虎或遭遇挫折，就会违约。因此，损失一开始很低，在最初的36-48个月内增加，然后随着所有的不良因素被清除，损失就趋于平缓。因此，原始批次或自发起以来的时间很重要。

- en: I took several cohorts from the Bear Stearns Asset Trust (eg, 2007, 2006), and
    looked at their loss curves, putting them all in the same 'time from origination'
    frame. As you can see the latter cohorts had much greater delinquency rates. For
    the 2003 cohort, only 6.6% had gone 60 days delinquent after 15 months, the next
    year's cohort, it was 9.2, then 15.0, 27.8, and in 2007 it came down a little,
    to 23, which is still really high. You would have thought that after the market
    kind of blew up in March 2007 they would have tightened up standards immediately,
    but I guess no one did anything for another 6 months, at which time, the market
    was about to cease to exist. The 2005 and earlier cohorts are flattening out,
    as most of these losses have been realize, but the 2006 and2007 have to hit their
    inflection point. At some point, they will decline, but the question is, when.

  zh: 我从Bear Stearns Asset Trust那里拿了几个队伍（例如2007年、2006年），并查看了他们的损失曲线，将它们都放在了相同的“起始时间”框架中。正如你所看到的，后来的队伍拥有更高的拖欠率。对于2003年队伍，仅有6.6%的人在15个月后经历了60天的拖欠，随后一年的队伍是9.2%，然后是15.0%，27.8%，在2007年稍有下降，变成了23，这仍然是很高的。你本以为在2007年3月市场出现问题后，他们会马上收紧标准，但我猜没有人在另外6个月内做了任何事情，那个时候市场即将停止存在。2005年及更早的队伍正在趋于平稳，因为大多数的损失已经得到了体现，但2006年和2007年必须达到拐点。在某个时候，它们会下降，但问题是，何时。
- en: We hope the 2006 cohort should subside in about 10 months, but it could be earlier
    rather than later. I would guess earlier, because generally the worst credit defaults
    faster than the good credit, because good credit has more a base mortality based
    on bad luck which is somewhat constant over time, whereas the 'bad' credit merely
    gets exposed quickly and then cannot default again. So, to the extent these were
    bad originations, the loss curves should flatten out more quickly than the base
    assumption. Of course, who knows. We do not have any experience with residential
    loss curves in this kind of environment. It's hard to defend a scenario when you
    don't have any comparable data, and so, this market is now closed. the ABX does
    not have a 2008-1 index, because nothing was issued.

  zh: 我们希望2006年队伍在大约10个月内会减少，但可能比较早。我会猜测比较早，因为通常最糟糕的信用比好的信用更快地违约，因为好的信用有更多基于倒霉的固定时间基础死亡率，而‘糟糕’的信用仅仅是快速暴露然后无法再次违约。所以，到了这些不良发行的程度，损失曲线应该比基础假设更快地趋于平稳。当然，谁知道呢。我们对这种环境中的住宅损失曲线没有任何经验。在你没有任何可比数据的情况下，很难捍卫一种情景，因此，这个市场现在已经关闭。ABX没有2008-1指数，因为没有东西被发布。
