- en: I have attached a copy of the Table of Contents for the May issue below. The
    cover story for this issue was written by Mark Wolfinger and focuses on the CBOE
    benchmark indices for [buy-write](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/buy-write)
    ([covered call](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/covered%20calls))
    [put-write](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/put-write) and collar
    strategies. In my opinion, these three options strategies are attractive ways
    for investors who seek to outperform the broad-based indices in declining, sideways
    and slightly bullish markets – which is not a bad description of the market activity
    we have been seeing lately. In the case of collars, one can also have complete
    protection against market crashes and fund this approach entirely by selling calls.

    (the art of finding a very narrow slice of the investment universe as an appropriate
    gauge of portfolio performance) as well as my recurring column, Charting the Market,
    which makes heavy use of options data. In addition to the introductory Editor’s
    Note, I also penned the Back Page commentary, which puts my personal slant on
    the process of educating a trader.
