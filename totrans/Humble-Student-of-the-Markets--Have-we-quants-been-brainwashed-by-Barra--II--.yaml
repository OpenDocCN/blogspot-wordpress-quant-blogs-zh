    risk model that got equity quants into trouble in August 2007\. What got quants
    into trouble in August 2007 was the mindset of the only active risk that should
    be taken is stock selection, or residual risk, and that we should control for
    industry risk and common factor risk such as size, style, etc.

    residuals, while using stock selection strategies that can only work if equation
    (1) does not hold (no factor bets). Since active mangers will be concentrating
    their portfolios in those securities expected to act alike in providing superior
    returns, the average residual covariance will be positive…***Hence, if we use
    a risk model which assumes uncorrelated residuals we will have a downward biased
    estimate of the risks not identified by the factors of our risk model***.

    where some but not all of the selection factors are in common with the risk model.
    In such cases, the risk model will tend to neutralize exposure to the risk factors,
    which will lead to the selection of a security set which are weak on the selection
    factors which are in common with the risk model, while having extremely high exposure
    to the selection factors which are presumed independent of the risk model. As
    such, ***it is easy for a multi-factor selection strategy to become dependent
    on a single component, defeating the purpose of the multifactor construct.***

    is becoming a crowded trade, then it’s time to move outside of that box. Goldman
    Sachs published a research report entitled “A Stockpicker’s Reality: Part III,
    Sector strategies for maximizing returns to stockpicking” in 2002 where they “examine
    the degree to which risk management strategies can be used to increase returns.
    This question differs substantially from the normal application of risk control,
    which is focused on tracking error rather than returns.” Their conclusion was:'
