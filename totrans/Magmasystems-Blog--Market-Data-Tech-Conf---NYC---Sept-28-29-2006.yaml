- en: We should have more fans of Market Data where I work, seeing how Craig kept
    everyone until after 5PM on the Friday before Labor Day with an amazing lecture

- en: In the past, I have just built trader workstations that merely hooked up to
    a market data feed through some sort of communication mechanism (sockets, Tibco
    RV, EMS) without having to be concerned about the ins-and-outs of the data. However,
    Craig has been doing market data for 15 years, and it's a pleasure to work along
    someone who is so passionate about the area.
