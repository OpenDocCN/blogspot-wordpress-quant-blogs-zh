    case of demographic information. Cohort size fluctuations produce forecastable
    demand changes for age-sensitive sectors, such as toys, bicycles, beer, life insurance,
    and nursing homes. These demand changes are predictable once a specific cohort
    is born. We use lagged consumption and demographic data to forecast future consumption
    demand growth induced by changes in age structure. We find that demand forecasts
    predict profitability by industry. Moreover, forecasted demand changes 5 to 10
    years in the future predict annual industry stock returns. One additional percentage
    point of annualized demand growth due to demographics predicts a 5 to 10 percentage
    point increase in annual abnormal industry stock returns. However, forecasted
    demand changes over shorter horizons do not predict stock returns. The predictability
    results are more substantial for industries with higher barriers to entry and
    with more pronounced age patterns in consumption. ***A trading strategy exploiting
    demographic information earns an annualized risk-adjusted return of 5 to 7 percent.***
    We present a model of underreaction to information about the distant future that
    is consistent with the findings.

    policy. The buy-and-hold approach, long espoused by investment advisors during
    bull markets, will result in subpar returns in range-bound periods. Flat markets
    mean flat returns.

    Model](http://www.qwestfunds.com/publications/newsletters_pdf/newsletter_november_2009.pdf)
    to capture the swings of a flat market.
