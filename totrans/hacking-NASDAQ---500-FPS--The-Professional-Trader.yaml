- en: At 100K shares / day with a *net* pnl per share of 0.253cents (less than a penny)
    we could make it work. At 10k shares / day with 2.53 cents / share profit also
    in the realm of feasibility. Note that 25 cents / share profit for every share
    is possible but think your pushing it to expect that consistently day-in-day-out
    in high volume. Remember this is per share, not per trade.

    trading the spread+a tick or two and our edge is say 10%. Meaning 60% of our trades
    make that 2.543cents, and 40% of the trades loose 2.54 cents, NOTE: in reality
    that kind of equally priced distribution abs(win) == abs(loss)  is highly unlikely.'

    now 50K shares.

- en: Counting in trades lets say we`re trading lots of 100 shares, meaning we`re
    doing 500 trades / day. And lets say the market is open 6H / day which means 500
    trades equally spaced is 6 H * 60Min * 60Sec / 500 trades = 43.2sec. e.g. thats
    one trade every 43.secs for 6 hours but actually its half that because you need
    to enter/exit the position, so we`re doing 1 trade every 21.6 seconds.

- en: It starts to put this HF trading thing in perspective -> 1 trade every 21.6secs
    that makes 2.5 cents/ share on average, to makes $250 / day or $60K / year.....
    a nice healthy dose of reality.

    trading strategies, some un-related and others quite frankly you just would not believe.
    Having 20/20 hindsight theres so many things I would have done differently, but
    easily the most important would be to build non-trading income strategies, that
    cover your bills when the trading hits a rough patch - because when your starting
    out its just one endless bumpy rough ride.
