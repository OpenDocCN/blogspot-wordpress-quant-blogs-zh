    to watch. After the debate, different broadcasters conducted instant polls of
    who won the debate. The CNN poll showed that 60% believed that Biden had won,
    and 29% thought that Trump had won. The Fox poll showed that 60% thought Trump
    had won, and 39% thought Biden had won.'

    of electoral risk was also largely unchanged. My own survey of SPY's at-the-money
    option implied volatility shows that while implied volatility had fallen, the
    shape of the curve is unchanged. The early November election spike is still there,
    and risk remains elevated until mid-December.
