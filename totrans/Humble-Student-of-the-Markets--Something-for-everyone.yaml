- en: '**Mid-week market update**: The Presidential Debate last night was painful
    to watch. After the debate, different broadcasters conducted instant polls of
    who won the debate. The CNN poll showed that 60% believed that Biden had won,
    and 29% thought that Trump had won. The Fox poll showed that 60% thought Trump
    had won, and 39% thought Biden had won.'

- en: In reality, the debate probably didn't change many minds, and the market's perception
    of electoral risk was also largely unchanged. My own survey of SPY's at-the-money
    option implied volatility shows that while implied volatility had fallen, the
    shape of the curve is unchanged. The early November election spike is still there,
    and risk remains elevated until mid-December.

  zh: 实际上，辩论可能并没有改变许多人的看法，市场对选举风险的感知也基本没有变化。我对SPY平值期权的隐含波动率进行的调查显示，虽然隐含波动率已经下降，但曲线的形状并未改变。11月初的选举高峰仍然存在，风险在12月中旬之前仍然较高。
