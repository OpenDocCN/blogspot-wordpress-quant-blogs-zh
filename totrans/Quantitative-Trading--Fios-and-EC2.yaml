    where I can connect via the internet to my execution broker at the highest speed

    speed is 20 Mbps, both faster than your typical T-1 line (1.5 Mbps). Furthermore,
    it costs only $45/month. Hey, even'

    that I can run more strategies without cluttering my office with computers. Finding
    one will obviate the need for any big investment in internet connectivity at the

    to get set up and running, especially with their securities precautions. The learning

    or fail to bundle properly. (Bundling means saving the software configuration
    for future use.) I am using Windows instances. Maybe those who use Linux instances
    have better experiences?

- en: Thirdly, and most annoyingly, when a new instance is started, Windows often
    cannot automatically synchronize its clock with time.windows.com or any other
    internet clock. As a result, the time is often wrong. Now, this may not be a big
    deal for usual office work. But when your automated trading strategy depends crucially
    on the time of the day, it can be quite fatal to your profit. If anyone has experienced
    a similar problem with Window's clock and know a fix, please let me know!
