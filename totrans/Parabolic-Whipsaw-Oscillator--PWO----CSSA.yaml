    to the PTO and PSO would be a measure of the probability that a PSAR trade will
    be successful. While the PSAR looks great on a chart to the average trader, the
    system tester knows that the PSAR can be inconsistent due to frequent signal changes.
    It is logical that if you follow the PSAR with the prevailing trend, eventually
    you will have a successful trade. Unlike a roulette wheel, a sequence of failed
    trades to catch a trend are not truly independent, and will eventually lead to
    a profitable trade. This is due to the nature of trends and volatility: 1) long-term
    trends persist in the market and 2) volatility is mean-reverting. Thus it stands
    to reason that if we tracked the number of consecutive failed trades we may find
    that the odds of a winning trade are higher after a sequence of losses. The PWO
    is calculated as follows:'

    this is conceptually similar to recording the length of up and down runs.

    trades versus the last 100 losing PSAR run lengths (ie consecutive # of losing
    trades) this is the PWO.'

    that a new trade will be successful. Conversely, when the PWO gets really low
    this implies an unusually high frequency of winning trades—this is a warning that
    future trades will be unsuccessful and possibly a unique indicator of an impending
    intermediate term market correction.
