    I mentioned that the [ISEE](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/ISEE)
    is setting new records on a daily for the all-time lowest readings in the 20,
    50 and 100 simple moving averages and pointed out that the CBOE Equity Put to
    Call numbers have spiked to record levels as well.  I thought a graphic might
    do a better job of telling the story, so I have attached a weekly chart of the
    CBOE Equity Put to Call Ratio below.'

- en: The chart goes back to the point at which the CBOE started publishing equity
    only put to call data and uses a 10 week EMA as a smoothing function.  As the
    chart shows, the current EMA of 82 is a new record, eclipsing the old record of
    August 2004.  In retrospect, 2004 was a great buying opportunity for those who
    had the fortitude to go against the crowd.  As for the present, while the jury
    is still out, the odds are that the current situation is also a good buying opportunity,
    as difficult as it may be for some to pull the trigger.
