    contest has been…well…less than tepid so far. At this stage I would consider the
    contest wide open, meaning that the bar is quite low right now for anyone interested
    in claiming the honor of being the first ever guest contributor to the *VIX and
    More* chart of the week and also pocketing a free one year subscription to [*Expiring
    Monthly: The Option Traders Journal*](http://www.expiringmonthly.com/) in the
    process.'
