# VIX and More: Ticker Sense on VIX Spikes

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/08/ticker-sense-on-vix-spikes.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/08/ticker-sense-on-vix-spikes.html#0001-01-01)

This morning [Ticker Sense](http://tickersense.typepad.com/) published an analysis of the [four previous instances](http://tickersense.typepad.com/ticker_sense/2007/08/spike-in-the-vi.html) where the VIX has risen more than 100% in a three month period.

Among their findings is that the greater the drop in the SPX during this period, the greater the rebound in this index during the following month, as shown in the following chart, which is courtesy of Birninyi Associates / Ticker Sense:

An even more interesting finding – and one consistent with the capitulation theory – is that in each of the five instances (assuming last week’s VIX spike will turn out to be the top this time around), the largest move in the VIX came during the last 20% of the VIX run-up period.
