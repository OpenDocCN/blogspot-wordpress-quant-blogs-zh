    dominant college wrestlers, and they had a great match. Both were very cautious,
    and Dake won 2-1 in overtime (Taylor in blue, Dake in red, right). You can see
    it

- en: Personally, I'm a Taylor fan. He goes for big moves more often, and I appreciate
    that. Sure, occasionally he gets pinned, but I prefer that type of style to the
    more methodical approach of Dake. I love guys who usually win big, risking the
    occasional loss, to those who never lose but do not dominate when they win. Their
    weight class has Tyler Caldwell of OSU as well, so this year should be very fun.
