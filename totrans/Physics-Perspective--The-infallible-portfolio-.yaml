- en: ', Ricardo Fenholz of Columbia University makes what seems (to me at least)
    to be a rather incredible claim: that it''s relatively easy to construct a portfolio
    that is guaranteed to outperform the S&P 500 over one year (or any other interval
    you like) and also has a limited downside during that year. The idea is the take
    the S&P 500 Index and tweak it a little, creating a portfolio with less weight
    in stocks with higher capitalization, and more weight in those with less capitalization,
    and presto -- you have something guaranteed to outperform the S&P 500, he claims.
    Is that possible? That easy? Here''s a little more detail:'

- en: To understand how this works, let’s consider the S&P 500 U.S. stock index. Suppose
    that we wish to invest some money in S&P 500 stocks for one year. Currently, Apple
    has a total market capitalization of roughly $500 billion, making it the largest
    stock in the S&P 500 and equal to approximately 4% of the total capitalization
    of the entire index. Suppose that we believe it is very unlikely or impossible
    that either Apple or any other corporation’s capitalization will be equal to more
    than 99% of the total S&P 500 capitalization for this entire year during which
    we plan to invest. As long as this turns out to be true, then it is actually pretty
    simple to construct a portfolio containing S&P 500 stocks that is guaranteed to
    outperform the S&P 500 index over the course of the year and that has a limited
    downside relative to this index. In essence, we can construct a portfolio that
    will never fall below the value of the S&P 500 index by more than, say, 5% and
    that is guaranteed to achieve a higher value than the S&P 500 index by the end
    of the year.[1]

    portfolio together with a short position in the S&P 500 index, then we have a
    trading strategy that requires no initial investment, has a limited downside,
    and is guaranteed to produce positive wealth by the end of the year. According
    to standard financial theory, this should not be possible.[2] Furthermore, the
    assumptions that guarantee that our portfolio will outperform the S&P 500 index
    appear entirely reasonable. After all, not for one day in the more than 50-year
    history of the S&P 500 has one corporation’s market capitalization come anywhere
    close to equaling even 50% of the total capitalization of the market. A 99% share
    of total market capitalization would essentially amount to there being only one
    corporation in the entire U. S. for an entire year. This seems like neither a
    likely outcome nor one that investors should take seriously when constructing
    their portfolios.

    the S&P 500 index look like? There are many different ways in which such a portfolio
    can be constructed, but one feature common to all such portfolios is that relative
    to the S&P 500 index itself, they place more weight on those stocks with small
    total market capitalizations and less weight on those stocks with large total
    market capitalizations. The weight that an index such as the S&P 500 places on
    each individual stock is equal to the ratio of that stock’s total market capitalization
    relative to all stocks’ total market capitalizations taken together. In the case
    of Apple, then, the S&P 500 index would place a weight of roughly 4% in this individual
    stock while those portfolios that use HFT to outperform this index would instead
    place a weight of less than 4% in Apple stock.

    no stock in the market comes to dominate the market in the sense that its market
    capitalization comes to be a high fraction of that of the entire market. This
    is, as he notes, a fairly weak assumption, although the weaker you make the assumption,
    the longer the time interval over which this idea apparently works.

    a simple recipe could work, and can't see the intuition behind it. What if the
    high cap stocks happen to perform brilliantly next year, relative to the lower
    cap stocks? Wouldn't this portfolio with underweighted high cap stocks then underperform
    the S&P Index? I've had a quick look at

    rate of growth, resulting in a sufficiently strong repelling drift away from an
    appropriate boundary; and that all other stocks have "sufficiently high" rates
    of growth.

    dominance of a single stock. Indeed, this seems like saying that, if one assumes
    that large cap stocks will perform poorly, and small caps stock better, then we
    can build a portfolio guaranteed to outperform the S&P 500 Index by weighting
    small cap stocks more heavily. Isn't that like assuming we know the future?

    is quite dense and light on intuitive discussion of the logic. Fernholz suggests
    that perhaps the existence of these superior portfolios -- which require continuous
    rebalancing by high-frequency buying and selling of many stocks -- explains some
    of the very high profits consistently earned by quantitative high-frequency hedge
    funds such as Renaissance Technology's Medallion Fund. I think I find more convincing

    the past decade or so can be accounted for by fairly vanilla long short equity
    strategies, with increasing use of leverage in the mid 2000s (used to maintain
    high reported earnings even as raw earnings fell off due to competition).
