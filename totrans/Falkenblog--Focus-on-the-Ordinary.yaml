    on one hand it seems like an optimal focus. Also, the outliers should highlight
    the essence of something. A stock that has risen 10 fold, or a great athlete,
    supposedly lays bare the essence of its greatness.

    We watch sports and learn about Usain Bolt, a most unusual man. Or my kids read
    the Guiness Book of World Records, containing stories about 1200 lb men and giant
    frogs. News is biased towards the exceptional, it takes no effort to emphasize
    it. In fact, it takes effort to see the ordinary. It's too bad people think of
    heroes as those who, for a brief moment, offered their life in some battle or
    harrowing situation, compared to the much more common heroism of providing one's
    family, not complaining, and being charitable to friends and neighbors, for decades.

    and also random chance. We hope that we can more clearly see the intrinsic qualities
    associated with, say, a rising stock, by looking at sthose stocks that went up
    10-fold last year. Yet, any extremum is probably a large random error. We simply
    can't predict the future very well, say an R2 of only 10%. Thus, a 100% stock
    return contains, on average, a 90% error. Yet, conditional up rising this much,
    this is only the mean error, its standard error is at least as large, meaning,
    any singular 100% return is probably all randomness. In this case, more analysis
    is worthless, like trying to explain a lottery number. The explanatory characteristics
    are irrelevant for these cases.

  zh: 一个问题是，任何极值都是由其独特的内在特征和随机机会造成的。我们希望可以更清晰地看到，比如说，通过观察去年涨了十倍的股票，来看与上涨股票相关的内在特质。然而，任何极值大概都是一个很大的随机误差。我们简直不能很好地预测未来，比如说，只有10%的R2。因此，100%的股票回报，平均来说，包含了90%的误差。然而，假设上升了这么多，这只是平均误差，其标准误差至少和平均一样大，这意味着，任何单独的100%的回报大概都是纯粹的随机性。在这种情况下，更多的分析是毫无价值的，就像试图解释一组彩票号码。这些情况下的解释特征是无关紧要的。
- en: I remember when I worked at Moody's working on default models. The CFA types
    liked to do case studies of famous financial catastrophes, and worked through
    all the sub-accounts of say, Boston Chicken, or Enron. Unfortunately, these were
    really poor archetypes, and we could found that complimenting these analyses with
    our default model made both look less relevant. The cases that made for a great
    narrative usually involved a good degree of fraud, which is difficult to detect
    in real time. In the end, the group that sold training seminars on credit analysis
    continued their program of exceptional case studies, our models simply grinded
    out boring probabilities independent of these examples, and they remain independent
    areas of interest.

- en: I find it much more fruitful to look at averages, mainly between groupings of
    interesting explanatory variables, and their correlation with the desiderata--not
    the reverse. That is, instead of looking at the top 10 stocks from last year,
    look at things like the top decile of p/e ratios, which predict stock returns
    at a much more modest level. We know these things are inversely correlated with
    returns (the value effect), so then the question is, how can I take advantage
    of this? If I combine this with cashflow/assets, or momentum, how does this work?
    Sure, it may at best add a couple percent to your annualized return, but at least
    its feasible. Needless to say, the current focus leads to an excess focus on highly
    volatile stocks, which is why I argue that these risky stocks have lower returns
    on average than their more boring counterparts.

  zh: 我发现，观察平均值更有意义，主要是在有趣的解释变量的分组之间，以及它们与我们所期望的结果的相关性 -- 而不是相反。也就是说，与其看去年排名前十的股票，不如看看像市盈率的前十分位数之类的东西，这些对股票回报的预测要小得多。我们知道这些因素与回报呈负相关（价值效应），所以问题是，我怎样才能利用这一点呢？如果我将这个与现金流/资产或动能结合起来，这样做会有什么效果呢？当然，这可能最多只会使你的年化收益率增加几个百分点，但至少这是可行的。不用说，目前的关注点导致过分关注高度波动的股票，这就是为什么我认为这些风险股的平均回报低于它们更乏味的同行的原因。
- en: Extremums can be informative, but they tend to dominate our information set
    anyway because they lend themselves to interesting narratives. Sure it would be
    best to know the big events if you had a time machine, but living in the present,
    if you really want to predict, focus on those things that are potentially predictive,
    which generally means looking at how averages relate to averages, as opposed to
    how outliers related to averages. The latter is mainly selection bias and random
    error.

  zh: 极值可能会提供信息，但它们往往会主导我们的信息集，因为它们自身就具有有趣的叙述。如果能够时光倒流的话，知道大事件当然是最好的，但生活在当下，如果你真的想要预测，那就专注于那些可能具有预测意义的事物，通常意味着观察平均值与平均值的关系，而不是离群值与平均值的关系。后者主要是选择偏误和随机误差。
