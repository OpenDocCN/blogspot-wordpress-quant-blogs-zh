- en: NY Times has an [article](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/13/business/media/bloomberg-admits-terminal-snooping.html)
    around the usage of Boomberg terminal data to provide the Bloomberg New division
    with a competitive edge over the competition.  In all honesty, its not really
    surprising, especially given the BBG terminal is in every bank, central banks,
    rival news organizations, Congress and even the Vatican, coupled with the fact
    that BBG Chat is historically one of the main communication channels for the last
    n years.

    service representative chats are monitored……..
