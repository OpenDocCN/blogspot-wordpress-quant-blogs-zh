    whole week off, with the VIX falling 9.3% from 16.23 to 14.72.

- en: It is unusual for the VWSI to register four consecutive weeks of a zero reading
    (it happens about once a year) and equally unusual to see a zero in eight out
    of eleven weeks.  In the past, this type of flat line consolidation has not generally
    preceded a breakout in volatility, in contrast to some stocks that tend to trade
    in an increasingly narrow range before breaking out.
