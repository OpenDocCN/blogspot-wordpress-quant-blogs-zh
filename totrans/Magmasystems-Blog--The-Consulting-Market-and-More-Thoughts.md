# Magmasystems Blog: The Consulting Market and More Thoughts

> 来源：[http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2007/10/consulting-market-and-more-thoughts.html#0001-01-01](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2007/10/consulting-market-and-more-thoughts.html#0001-01-01)

Comments from various contacts in the consulting industry lead me to believe that there is a slowdown in financial IT consulting, with benches growing at various consulting companies around the globe. At the same time, there is a hiring freeze going on at many Wall Street companies, with exceptions being made only for outstanding candidates.

A lot probably has to do with the subprime mess and the incredible losses that many Wall Street companies have announced. Bonus season is going to be very "challenging" this year.

My company will be making a concerted effort to recruit outstanding IT people from outside. We realize that new blood is the way to shake things up, and transform our shop into one of the major IT houses on Wall Street. The business side has been taken over by people who have CompSci degrees from top universities, and this new regime realizes that tech will drive future profitability.

Despite this, I have open headcount for 2008 for the Complex Event Processing initiative. When I get back from my week in France, I will post a general call for help. If you have a driving interest in CEP, and you can code in C#, Java, and C++, and you know how to deal with Linux and Windows, then I want to speak to you. I think that CEP will provide a fundamental change in the way we trade and the way that apps are written and the way that data is visualized.
