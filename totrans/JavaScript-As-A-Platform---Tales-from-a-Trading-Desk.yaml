- en: As the industry shifted from desktop GUI development to the web, it seemed natural
    to port the most successful patterns and designs to the new paradigm. After 15
    years of trying, we feel that there are still no¬†**component-based frameworks**¬†that
    have successfully achieved this. We recommend not attempting to make web development
    into something that it fundamentally is not. It is time to accept the page and
    request-based nature of the web, and focus on the frameworks that support ‚Äì rather
    than work against ‚Äì these concepts

- en: '**Backbone.js**¬†is a great example of an abstraction pushed too far. While
    we initially liked the ease of wire-up, in practice it suffers from the same issues
    as all such data-bound frameworks from WebForms to client/server tools. We find
    that it blurs the framework and model too much, forcing either bad architectural
    decisions or elaborate framework hackery in order to preserve sanity'
