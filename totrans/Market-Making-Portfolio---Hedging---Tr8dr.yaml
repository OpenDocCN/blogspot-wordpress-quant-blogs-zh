- en: With market making we can try to be neutral by skewing prices in such a way
    as to maintain a neutral position.   To the extent that the market can become
    1-sided (in momentum) or may have large sized requests (if offering at different
    sizes), one’s portfolio may require explicit hedging.
  prefs: []

- en: In a live market-making scenario we can determine how we want to hedge on a
    case-by-case basis and with a view on where it is cheapest to achieve the hedge.
      Within a FX portfolio there is opportunity to hedge an excess position in one
    currency with a position in one or more other currency pairs, potentially taking
    on some basis-risk.

     The intuition is that a covariance matrix with highly aligned (correlated) vectors
    will have smaller volume.   Likewise, lower variance will reduce the magnitude

- en: The optimization problem is similar to the packing problem, where we try to
    determine how many units of each item, where we have K distinct item types (our
    beta vectors), optimally fill a bag.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In our case, the items to be packed are the beta vectors and the bag is the
    position we are trying to reduce.   We are trying to determine how many units
    of each beta vector to use in combination with other beta vectors to achieve the
    best reduction (packing).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To reduce the combinatorial possibilities to something finite, we can assume
    that only certain scalings of the beta vectors are used.   For a FX portfolio,
    the market tends to trade in multiples of 100K on one of the currencies (usually
    the base currency). In equities, the convention would usually be units of 100.

- en: I should mention that there are many approaches that can be taken in evaluating
    portfolio risk.  Gary Basin suggested looking at a PCA decomposition of the portfolio.
     PCA is definitely a useful way in determining the primary determinants of variance
    in the portfolio.   I chose to use a method that allowed me to factor out mean-reverting
    sub-portfolios.   There are so many approaches to this, can’t really comment on
    what is best.
