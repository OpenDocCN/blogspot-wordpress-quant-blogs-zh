    blew in from [China](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/China). Back
    on [February 27](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/February%2027), 2007,
    concerns about the Chinese government raising interest rates to discourage speculation
    helped to trigger an 8.8% loss in the Shanghai Composite Index and a 9.9% loss
    in the FTSE/Xinhua China 25 index that is the basis for the popular Chinese ETF,
    [FXI](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/FXI).

    world fell in sympathy, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing 416 points
    later that day to close at 12,216\. The simultaneous [64% spike](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/02/birthday-party.html)
    in the VIX still stands as a one day record, though two years later it seems a
    little quaint to talk about a massive [VIX spike](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20spikes)
    when the VIX failed to get out of the teens.

    VIX jumped from 10.00 to 12.00 and that floor kept rising, first to 15, then 16,
    18 and 22\. In fact, the pattern of higher lows continued for over a year.

- en: In the StockCharts chart, I have elected to show volatility as an area chart
    to emphasize the rising tide aspect of volatility. Even though the May 2008 bottom
    prints as a lower low and the IndyMac Bank failure in July shows up as a lower
    high, this turned out to be the last glimpse of somewhat normal volatility before
    September 2008 unleashed the full force of the volatility storm. For easy reference
    and archival purposes, I have highlighted a handful of fundamental events that
    coincided with some of the important tops in the VIX in the past two years.

    the first global volatility ripples, yet only a few hearty souls are willing to
    go out on a limb and predict that the worst is behind us.

- en: Frankly, it think it is unlikely – though certainly not out of the realm of
    possibility – that we will see the VIX close over 80 again during the next decade,
    but then again two years ago no one was predicting that it would be so easy to
    keep the VIX above the 40 level for five full months.

    the same again.
