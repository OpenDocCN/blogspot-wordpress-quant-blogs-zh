    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    signal. A bullish Trend Model signal that gets less bullish is a trading "sell"
    signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading
    "buy" signal. The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of
    the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. The turnover rate
    of the trading model is high, and it has varied between 150% to 200% per month.

    of a price trend. The higher the ADX level, the strong the trend. The chart below
    shows the relative performance of technology stocks compared to the market. Even
    though this sector remains in a relative uptrend, the ADX of the relative performance
    ratio began to roll over in late 2017\. The weakness in trend culminated in the
    recent carnage of FANG and semiconductor stocks.

    in the next recession. Facebook and Google were the prime targets because they
    were in the surveillance business, largely because of the creepiness effect of
    their practices. Of the other FANG names, Amazon is also vulnerable because of
    their strategy to entice users into their walled garden by learning everything
    about them in order to sell them goods and services. The latest Facebook episode
    mane mean that the competitive moats of these companies may be already breached.
    A prolonged period of market performance may be in store, much in the manner of
    Microsoft after its anti-trust battle with the Justice Department.

    is also showing signs of weakening. The SPX recently breached an uptrend line,
    and its ADX has also rolled over.

    is indeed failing, can any other sectors step up to take its place? As well, does
    the weakness in these high octane and high beta groups the sign of a top for the
    overall stock market?
