    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    of the trading model is high, and it has varied between 150% to 200% per month.

    of a price trend. The higher the ADX level, the strong the trend. The chart below
    shows the relative performance of technology stocks compared to the market. Even
    though this sector remains in a relative uptrend, the ADX of the relative performance
    ratio began to roll over in late 2017\. The weakness in trend culminated in the
    recent carnage of FANG and semiconductor stocks.

    were in the surveillance business, largely because of the creepiness effect of
    their practices. Of the other FANG names, Amazon is also vulnerable because of
    their strategy to entice users into their walled garden by learning everything
    about them in order to sell them goods and services. The latest Facebook episode
