- en: While researching multi-objective optimization for large search spaces and clustering,
    Quantivity stumbled upon some interesting recent work by Aranha and Iba applying
    memetic and biologic algorithms. Latter work appears along the line of Brabazon
    and O’Neill [Biologically Inspired Algorithms for Financial Modelling](http://www.springerlink.com/content/q763h7lxj7701v76/)
    (which, responding to previous [comments](https://quantivity.wordpress.com/2010/02/15/trading-the-unobservable/#comments),
    may be potentially useful for those looking for published examples of GA applied
    to trading, as it includes numerous simplistic case studies in Part III).

    genetic evolution, and thus may have some interesting uses where classic GA has

    fine tunes the solutions generated by the GA.

- en: Shown that a form of clustering happens from this low level rules. Ant clustering
    has its positive and negative points when compared to more traditional techniques,
    such as k-means, but it can be very useful for the clustering of data that is
    shaped into complex shapes.

    warranted (if only due to its name).
