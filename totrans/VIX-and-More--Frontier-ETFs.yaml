    relatively new class of ETFs called [frontier ETFs](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/frontier%20ETFs).
    Many of these frontier ETFs are single country ETFs, but two in particular stand
    out as diversified frontier plays:'

    first because it is not a global, but a regional ETF, based on the NASDAQ OMX
    Middle East North Africa Index. At present the fund has a strong emphasis on the
    Persian Gulf and should be considered as a slightly more liquid (but still relatively
    illiquid) alternative to MES and GAF, trading approximately 10,000 shares per
    day. As of last week, the top country allocations were in the United Arab Emirates
    (22.6%), Egypt (20.2%) and Kuwait (16.9%).

- en: In contrast to PMNA, FRN ([holdings](http://www.claymore.com/etf/fund/frn))
    has taken a much broader and more geographically diversified global approach,
    without a particular regional emphasis. Specifically, the ETF is designed to track
    the Bank of New York Mellon New Frontier DR Index. As of September 30, the top
    country allocations were Chile (28.6%), Poland (15.9%) and Egypt (15.4%).

    of performance for the first five months of 2009, the more diversified FRN had
    been a much stronger performer during the latter half of the year. Not surprisingly,
    given PMNA's exposure to the Persian Gulf, the gap has widened significantly during
    the last few days.

    such as Market Vectors Africa ([AFK](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/AFK)),
    it is important to keep in mind that there are many single country ETFs available,
    with an increasing amount of geographical diversity. Just last week, the first
    Poland ETF ([PLND](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/PLND)) was launched.
    For investors who are interested in single country Middle Eastern ETFs, Van Eck
    is planning to launch new ETFs for Egypt and Kuwait.

- en: Finally, consider that frontier ETFs are likely to appeal only to investors
    who can tolerate high levels of risk. The multi-country and single country variants
    suffer from low liquidity and high volatility, making it unwise to build up large
    positions until trading volumes increase dramatically from current levels.
