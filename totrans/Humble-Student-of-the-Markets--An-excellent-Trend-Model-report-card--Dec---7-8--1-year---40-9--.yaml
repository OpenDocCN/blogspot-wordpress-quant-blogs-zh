    asset allocation, model which uses trend following techniques as applied to commodity
    and global stock market prices to generates a composite Risk-On/Risk-Off signal
    (risk-on, risk-off or neutral). I have begun updating readers on the Trend Model

    interesting, there is no substitute for actual performance. As a proof of concept,
    I started to manage a small account that traded long, inverse and leveraged ETFs
    on the major US market averages and, on occasion, sector and industry ETFs. Trading
    decisions were based on Trend Model signals combined with some short-term sentiment
    indicators. The inception date of the account was September 30, 2013 and the chart
    below represents an interim report card of that account.

    is intended to be an absolute return vehicle. While I do show the SPY total return,
    which includes re-invested dividends, for illustrative purposes, the SP 500 is
    not an appropriate benchmark for measuring the performance of this modeling technique.

    environment. 2014 was an extraordinary year for stock prices as the SPX more or

    example of this in October 2014, when the account eked out a return of 1.4% after

    choppiness will indeed be an acid test for this trend following strategy. Positive
    returns during these volatile periods will lean more on the short-term sentiment
    models that I use to better assist the main trend following model to calibrate
    both entry and exits as well as the magnitude of position commitment.
