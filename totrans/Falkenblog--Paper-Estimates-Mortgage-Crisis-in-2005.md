Yuliya Demyanyk and Otto Van Hemert estimate the mortgage problems at the end of 2005 (

[Understanding the Subprime Mortgage Crisis](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1020396)

). They find basically that deterioration of mortgage underwriting (higher LTV, ARMs as opposed to fixed income securities, interest-only loans), and find that credit standards deteriorated significantly over the prior 5 years. But I think they really bury the lead, which is that they estimate a doubling of default rates as of the end of 2005 for the next year's new mortgages. Even if I knew that to be true, I would not have anticipated the crisis we observed.
