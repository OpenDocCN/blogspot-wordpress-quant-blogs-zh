    will typically trade in a direction opposite the SPX, so it is unusual that they
    both close higher. On Fridays, the VIX has a natural tendency to dip in the afternoon,
    so it is most unusual to see them both close higher on Friday. The study below
    was last seen in 4/30/12 subscriber letter. It examines other instances of the
    VIX and SPX both closing higher on a Friday while the SPX is in an uptrending
    market. All stats are updated.

    study. That edge has primarily played out over the first three days.
