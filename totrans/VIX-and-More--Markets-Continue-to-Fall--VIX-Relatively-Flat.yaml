    VIX has been relatively flat – and considerable lower than it was in October and
    November – while the markets have been making multi-year lows.

    From a strictly statistical perspective, 20 day historical volatility in the SPX
    peaked at 85 at the end of October and now sits at about 41, so in terms of actual
    recent volatility, a VIX of about half of the October-November highs seems consistent
    with recent market movements.

    not historical volatility and implied volatility incorporates incremental changes
    in uncertainty and [fear](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/fear) on
    top of recent historical volatility. At least this is an easy way to conceptualize
    some of the component parts of the VIX. The logical conclusion is that not only
    is the historical volatility component of the VIX dwindling, but so too are some
    of the uncertainty and fear aspects.

    and uncertainty. Still, there is a process of habituation and coping that has
    taken place over the course of the past six months. Michael Kahn, writing in Barron’s
    on Wednesday, calls this phenomenon [Slow-Motion Capitulation](http://online.barrons.com/article/SB123619880239032479.html),
    which will eventually lead to an “apathy bottom.” The idea is similar to what
    I [proposed a day earlier](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/03/possibility-of-stealth-bottom.html)
    as a “[stealth bottom](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/stealth%20bottom).”

    As I write this the S&P 500 index is 57.4% below its October 2007 high. In October
    and November, there were concerns that the SPX could fall several hundred points
    more. Well it has. Now a couple hundred additional points to the down side may
    still be in the cards, but it will be increasingly difficult for shorts to squeeze
    money out of already depressed equities. Also, as investors have slowly capitulated
    over the course of the past year or so, there are fewer and fewer holdouts left
    to panic – and many of those already have purchased put protection for their remaining
    long positions.

    spike. Regardless of what your directional outlook is for equities, this looks
    to be a good time to be selling options, particularly using [vertical credit spreads](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/vertical%20credit%20spread).
