- en: Another volatile week is in the books, with no signs of volatility coming to
    an end.  While the NASDAQ and VXN took [center stage at the volatility circus](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/09/volatility-index-comparison.html)
    this week, the VIX managed a weekly gain of 2.85 or 12.2% to end the week at 26.23
    – still the third highest end of week close since April 2003.

- en: With back to back 12+% weekly gains in the VIX, the VWSI has slid from +2 to
    -1 over the past two weeks.  These are still largely neutral readings; I do not
    consider the VWSI to generate tradeable signals unless readings reach at least
    +3 or -3.

    currently stands at 18.92, then any mean reverting activity related to the numbers
    above is likely to involve a declining VIX.  The trick, of course, is to get the
    time frame right.
