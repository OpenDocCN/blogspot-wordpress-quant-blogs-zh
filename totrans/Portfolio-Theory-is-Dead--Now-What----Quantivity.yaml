    and thus corresponding relevance of [modern portfolio theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory)
    and [asset allocation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_allocation) (strategic
    and [tactical](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_asset_allocation)). In short,
    Quantivity is *not a fan*.

    is insightful and relevant for both short- and long-term quantitative strategies.
    This perspective is informed by standard institutional and retail portfolio management
    as exemplified by [Grinold and Kahn](http://books.google.com/books?id=a1yB8LTQnOEC)
    and [Faber](http://www.theivyportfolio.com/), along with academic background in
    both economics and finance.

    accepting incremental “risk” demands compensation by commensurately higher return.

    non-negative and increasing. This conjecture underlies justification for mean-variance
    optimization, diversification, benchmarking, index investing, and thus much of
    modern retail investing.'
