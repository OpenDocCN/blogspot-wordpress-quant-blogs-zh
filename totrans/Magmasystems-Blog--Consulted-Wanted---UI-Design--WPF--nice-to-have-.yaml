- en: I have some $$$ in my consulting budget to hire a great UI designer for about
    6 months to help us in our Complex Event Processing effort. We want to design
    a UI that will blow the traders and the business folks away. Something that far
    away from the endless myriad of grids that you see on most trading floors. If
    you know the names Tufte and Few, then you are pointing inthe right direction.

    with alerting on real-time data, so experience in working with real-time is desired,
    but not required.'

- en: The consultant has to have a track record of designing compelling user interfaces,
    and prior capital markets experience is highly desireable. In order to consider
    the consultant, we need to see samples of prior work, and we will check your references
    in order to convince ourselves that the consultant was the one who did the major
    design work on the UI, not someone who dragged a ChartFX control into a form.

- en: The consultant does not have to be a developer (in fact, we would prefer someone
    who wasn't a developer), but has to be aware of what it takes to get your designs
    into code. This means that the consultant cannot give us an artistic masterpiece
    that is impossible to implement.

- en: The consultant will work with us 4 or 5 days a week, ON-SITE, on the Equities
    trading floor in the Tribeca section of Manhattan. This means we don't want to
    hear from consulting firms in Toronto and India who want to know if the work can
    be outsourced. I am telling you right now ... we will never be outsourcing any
    part of this project. The consultant need to see the white of the eyes of our
    traders.
