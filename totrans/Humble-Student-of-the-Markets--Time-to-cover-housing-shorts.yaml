    over. There are signs that valuations are starting to become more attractive in
    housing, value players are now entering the space and the homebuilding group is
    now technically undergoing a bottoming process relative to the market.

    With the caveat that value investors do tend to be early, sovereign funds have
    the advantage of being not directly constrained by the tight credit conditions
    that exist in the US right now.

    my belief is that the market has a negative bias, this group is likely to continue
    to fall. However, the easy money is over from shorting this group. If you are
    short, cover your shorts.
