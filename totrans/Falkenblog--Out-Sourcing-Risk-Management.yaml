    structured products and must not solely rely on the external credit ratings assigned
    to securitization exposures by the CRAs (Credit Rating Agencies). A bank should
    be aware that external ratings are a useful starting point for credit analysis,
    but are no substitute for full and proper understanding of the underlying risk,
    especially where ratings for certain asset classes have a short history or have
    been shown to be volatile. Moreover, a bank also should conduct credit analysis
    of the securitisation exposure at acquisition and on an ongoing basis. It should
    also have in place the necessary quantitative tools, valuation models and stress
    tests of sufficient sophistication to reliably assess all relevant risks.

    Clearly, in the latest crisis the rating agencies errored. Yet, the rating agencies
    generally don't go against conventional wisdom. I see no indicators suggesting
    that while the rating agencies ignored the risk of falling housing prices, more
    than a handful out of tens of thousands standard financial institutions were applying
    a 25% stress test to these assets.

    the various entities it is evaluating.These are inescabable, because if one moves
    from an issuer pays model, to a buyer pays, then the buyer's intests are in play.
    He probably will have a large inventory, and would probably want to see continued
    stable, high ratings for an asset class, just as an issuer would. Further, there
    would be a free rider problem among credit analysis buyers, which would potentially
    cause an underinvestment in them, because the centralized authority can not seize
    sufficient revenue from the value they produce. So, in any scenario, there is
    conflict of interest for an external ratings provider.

    more volume into a higher revenue and ROE activity. He lost, as has every risk
    manager in such a scenario. With hindsight, NINJA loans are indefensible, but
    in real time objecting was futile. When there is big money to be made doing X,

    documentation. To think regulators have the ability to analyze anew thousands
    of institutions individual risk underwriting just means they will be more overwhelmed.
    They will look for key words, perfunctory analysis that consultants will teach
    banks that are necessary, which in the end makes the underwriting just as susceptible
    to group-think as before. But at least the external rating agency is monitored
    critically, in a straightforward fashion, and there is some competition (ie, Fitch,
    S&P and Moody's). The myriad decentralized reports will have the added baggage
    of serving two purposes. Hitting the hot-buttons everyone knows regulators are

    they overreact indiscriminately, and this usually merely kills an error that is
    now so obvious as to be irrelevant going forward anyway. The bottom line is that
    people need to have good incentives, good data, and good judgment. If losing 80%
    of one's market cap is not sufficient incentive for firms to address this optimally
    given their specific contexts, why does one think the incentives, data, and judgment
    of legislators and bureaucrats in Washington or Basel are going to be better?
    Because they are selfless public servants? That's a grade-school view of politics.

    of all risk measurement, is worse.
