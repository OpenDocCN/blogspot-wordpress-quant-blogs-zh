- en: A bank should conduct analyses of the underlying risks when investing in the
    structured products and must not solely rely on the external credit ratings assigned
    to securitization exposures by the CRAs (Credit Rating Agencies). A bank should
    be aware that external ratings are a useful starting point for credit analysis,
    but are no substitute for full and proper understanding of the underlying risk,
    especially where ratings for certain asset classes have a short history or have
    been shown to be volatile. Moreover, a bank also should conduct credit analysis
    of the securitisation exposure at acquisition and on an ongoing basis. It should
    also have in place the necessary quantitative tools, valuation models and stress
    tests of sufficient sophistication to reliably assess all relevant risks.

    Clearly, in the latest crisis the rating agencies errored. Yet, the rating agencies
    generally don't go against conventional wisdom. I see no indicators suggesting
    that while the rating agencies ignored the risk of falling housing prices, more
    than a handful out of tens of thousands standard financial institutions were applying
    a 25% stress test to these assets.

    the various entities it is evaluating.These are inescabable, because if one moves
    from an issuer pays model, to a buyer pays, then the buyer's intests are in play.
    He probably will have a large inventory, and would probably want to see continued
    stable, high ratings for an asset class, just as an issuer would. Further, there
    would be a free rider problem among credit analysis buyers, which would potentially
    cause an underinvestment in them, because the centralized authority can not seize
    sufficient revenue from the value they produce. So, in any scenario, there is
    conflict of interest for an external ratings provider.

    functions. Think about the reaction to 9/11 and the calls for one unit in charge
    of intelligence gathering. Centralization has considerable benefits, which are
    often alluded to if you ever have to deal with an institutional IT infrastructure
    and their latest plan to centralize information.

    caused by key focal points, in this case, Moody's and S&P, or one thinks the more
    basic error was a ubiquitous incorrect belief. I tend to the latter. The rating

    as no one was arguing that assets should have a stress test for a 30% housing
    decline back in 2006\. No one. With hindsight, that was a mistake, but one everyone
    made. It is nice to think that people would have independently applied this if
    it was in their bailiwick, but just as no congressman wanted to appear to squelch
    more homeowning, and thus prohibit the US Housing and Urban Development Department
    from encouraging no down payment mortgages.

    Bill Syron's plans to accept more mortgages with weaker underwriting standards
    (Syron got $38MM, Andrukonis was let go). He was a risk manager telling his CEO
    that a risk that has never materialized, but is based on theory, should inhibit
    more volume into a higher revenue and ROE activity. He lost, as has every risk
    manager in such a scenario. With hindsight, NINJA loans are indefensible, but
    in real time objecting was futile. When there is big money to be made doing X,
    a theory but no data arguing against X, is not compelling.

    evaluating a complex financial institution is simply very difficult in the best
    of circumstances. They ask for risk reports, they will get them, but tables of
    exposures cross-tabbed by originator, region, etc., will just be butt-covering
    documentation. To think regulators have the ability to analyze anew thousands
    of institutions individual risk underwriting just means they will be more overwhelmed.
    They will look for key words, perfunctory analysis that consultants will teach
    banks that are necessary, which in the end makes the underwriting just as susceptible
    to group-think as before. But at least the external rating agency is monitored
    critically, in a straightforward fashion, and there is some competition (ie, Fitch,
    S&P and Moody's). The myriad decentralized reports will have the added baggage
    of serving two purposes. Hitting the hot-buttons everyone knows regulators are
    looking for, while pretending to be some great alpha-inspired individualized edge,
    built from the bottom up.

    waste. I think crisis bring out the worst in individuals and collectives because
    they overreact indiscriminately, and this usually merely kills an error that is
    now so obvious as to be irrelevant going forward anyway. The bottom line is that
    people need to have good incentives, good data, and good judgment. If losing 80%
    of one's market cap is not sufficient incentive for firms to address this optimally
    given their specific contexts, why does one think the incentives, data, and judgment
    of legislators and bureaucrats in Washington or Basel are going to be better?
    Because they are selfless public servants? That's a grade-school view of politics.
    I'm not saying markets are perfect, merely that regulators mandating decentralization
    of all risk measurement, is worse.
