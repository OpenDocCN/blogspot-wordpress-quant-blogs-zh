    true. I''m not going to say too much except to note that the strategy of the Wren-Lewis
    argument is essentially to ask "what are the alternatives to Rational Expectations?,"
    then to mention just one possible alternative that he calls "naive adaptive expectations,"
    and then to go on to criticize this silly alternative as being unrealistic, which
    it indeed is. But that''s no defense of RE.'

    ways to model how people form their expectations, for example by looking to psychology
    and experimental studies of how people learn (especially through social interactions
    and copying behavior). The only defense he offers on that score is to say they
    don't want too many details because they seek a "simple" way to model expectations
    so they can solve their favorite macroeconomic models. That fact that this renders
    such models possibly quite useless and misleading as guides to the real world
    doesn't seem to give him (or others) pause.

    I'm not sure why economists seem loath to use then. Simon Wren-Lewis gives one
    alternative as naive "adaptive expectations", but this seems like a straw man.
    Here people seem to believe more or less that trends will continue. That is truly
    naive. Expectations are important and the psychological literature on learning
    suggests that people form them in many ways, with heuristic theories and rules
    of thumb, and then adjust their use of these heuristics through experience. This
    is the kind of adaptive expectations that ought to be used in macro models.

    that defenders of RE often refer to really doesn't go very far in exploring learning.
    A review I read as recently as 2009 used learning algorithms which ASSUMED that
    people already know the right model of the economy and only need to learn the
    values of some parameters. I suspect this is done on purpose so that the learning
    process converges to RE -- and an apparent defense of RE is therefore achieved.
    But this is only a trick. Use more realistic learning behavior to model expectations
    and you find little convergence at all -- just ongoing learning as the economy
    itself keeps doing new things in ways the participants never quite manage to predict.

    device for much of the learning literature is the extent to which learning converges
    towards rational expectations." So again, it seems as if the purpose of the model
    is to see how we can get the conclusion we want, not to explore the kinds of things
    we might actually expect to see in the world. This is what makes people angry
    and I think rightfully about the RE idea. I suspect that REAL reason for this
    is that, if one uses more plausible learning behavior (not the silly naive kind
    of adaptive expectations), you find that your economy isn't guaranteed to settle
    down to any kind of equilibrium, and you can't say anything honestly about the
    welfare of any outcomes, and so most of what has been developed in economics turns
    out to be pretty useless. Most economists find that too much to stomach.
