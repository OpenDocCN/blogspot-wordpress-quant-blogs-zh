    of Economy Projections (SEP), it sharply lowered GDP growth for this year and
    it raised the Fed Funds projection to 4.4% for this year and 4.6% next year, which
    are both ahead of market expectations. In other words, higher for longer (though
    it did signal rate cuts in 2024).'

    for next year, but it did show some skepticism of the Fed's SEP by expecting rate
    cuts by September 2023.
