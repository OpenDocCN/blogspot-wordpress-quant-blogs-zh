    allocations are identical when people are envious.  She also finds situations
    where this equilibrium implies a higher equity allocation than in the base case.
    I would think, if you took this further, you would find that when trendy risky
    investments become popular, their expected return is actually negative.

    bit off because he had the incorrect value for the viscosity of air. It's interesting
    to look at the history of measurements of the charge of an electron, after Millikan.
    If you plot them as a function of time, you find that one is a little bit bigger
    than Millikan's, and the next one's a little bit bigger than that, and the next
    one's a little bit bigger than that, until finally they settle down to a number
    which is higher.

    aren't going 'all-in' because it's too large a change from the consensus.  Instead,
    it simply explains little things, more and more little things. If you believe
    it's the truth, the benefit is that you will get to see more agreement over time,
