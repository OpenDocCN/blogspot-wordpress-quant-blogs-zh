- en: When I penned yesterday’s [Record Volume in VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/05/record-volume-in-vxx.html),
    I had an inkling that the VIX-based volatility ETN might be having a coming out
    party soon. I did not, however, expect [VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX)
    to attract so much attention in just 24 hours.

    and is sure to be added to the watch lists of many more retail investors and find
    itself in the repertoire of a wider variety of hedge funds.

- en: For those who may be new to VXX, it is important to keep in mind that while
    there is strong directional agreement between VXX and the VIX (they move in the
    same direction in about 6 out of every 7 sessions), VXX tends to move at only
    *half* the rate the cash/spot VIX on a daily basis. So while VXX may lag the VIX
    in terms of a [juice factor](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX%20juice%20factor),
    it is probably the best way to trade volatility if one does not wish to do so
    in the options or futures market.

    would be, “When directionally correct is good enough!”
