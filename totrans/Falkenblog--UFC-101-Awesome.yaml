    a combination that makes the strategy space very large. But then the current best
    are truly awesome athletes that generate great shows. Saturday night's

    fourth round took him down. He then skillfully manuevered to Florian's back, setting
    up for a rear naked choke. Now, if a fighter gets a forearm under your chin from
    your back (he is hugging your body with his legs, facing your back), and locks
    this hand with his other arm, usually this ends the fight because you don't have
    the leverage to remove the choke, have nothing to strike, and simply must tap
    out or pass out. Florian is good at jiu-jitsu, so skillfully avoided the choke
    for a while. But then Penn started kicking him with his heel in Florian's gut,
    and when Florian finally reacted by naturally moving his hands to block these
    painful kicks, Penn slipped in the choke, and the fight was over in seconds. Beautiful.

- en: In the other premier bout, Anderson Silva moved up to 205 from 185, and fought
    Forest Griffin. Silva was like a guy plugged into the Matrix, moving at three
    times the speed of Griffin. In one beautiful sequence of moves Silva first avoided
    a right then swerved to avoid a left, came over the left and floored Griffin with
    an overhand right. This was all done moving his upper body, like watching Sugar
    Ray Leonard in his prime. Finally, Griffin comes in with a lunging right, and
    Silva backs up. Griffin follows forward with a left, Silva leans back to avoid
    the punch, but throws a pinpoint right that lands right on the chin. Griffin goes
    down, fight over. What is so awesome is how punches from hands with light gloves,
    when it hits the jaw it turns the neck, and the body's reaction is to simply turn
    off, the knees buckle, and the person is unconscious for a second at least. He
    threw the punch moving backward, so it was not particularly hard, but it was so
    precise it was devastating. Rumor has it Griffin's jaw was dislocated.
