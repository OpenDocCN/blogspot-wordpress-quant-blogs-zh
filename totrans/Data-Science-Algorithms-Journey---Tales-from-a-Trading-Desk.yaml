    once you‚Äôve got passed installing the software, the next problem is more than
    likely going to get, what data should I start with, and what [algorithms](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms175595.aspx)
    shall I use on the data.

    high level overview of data preparation, machine [learning](http://docs.h2o.ai/h2oclassic/resources/algoroadmap.html)

    then identify the additional data you want to aid you on further insight. ¬†This
    posting on [Public Safety](http://blog.h2o.ai/2015/04/deep-learning-public-safety/)
    offers a number of thought around tacking problem. ¬†For example, you can imagine
    being interested in looking at sales activity over time, married to the highs
    and lows of the stock market, and maybe also the duration of the sales cycle,
    and how its influenced buy the stock market.

    use case is probably an interesting starting point. ¬†Its a shame a sample data
    set isn‚Äôt provide for the use cases.
