# Falkenblog: My Book Out of Print

> 来源：[http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2013/03/my-book-out-of-print.html#0001-01-01](http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2013/03/my-book-out-of-print.html#0001-01-01)

My book is currently 'out of print' because I'm simply trying to correct some typos, and

[my publisher](https://www.createspace.com/)

does not allow printing while a text is being corrected. I currently have 3 simple syntax correction in the queue (eg, change a comma to a period).  I'll get back this change in 5 business days, and if all goes correctly I'll be up in three weeks. Otherwise, it will take another 3 weeks and we continue. 

If you want to self publish a book that has equations, expect the process to be very difficult. Equations, pictures, and Symbol fonts, are unconventional. For example, on several occasions I've tried to explain what a β is, and it's exasperating; think about getting an inline equation correctly formatted.

They take my changes and send them over to India, and as one can imagine it's a clusterpuck of miscommunication. First, they try to put all the request into a protocol that is completely documented, but alas none of my comments fit into their pre-fit categories, and they generates tons of automated respones that convey no information other than 'we received your comment.' I can't talk to those guys actually making the changes often (I did on my latest round, strangely), so no matter how much I talk to the American sending this off, it's all pretty much irrelevant because 12k miles away, that conversation doesn't count for anything. Most times I receive back my changes and they include changes to other parts of the book I didn't ask for. This is because when they transfer the book to other formats, the gifs or Symbol fonts don't carry over and so look like I want to change the formatting to some incomprehensible giberish known only to me, but also because they compare to a version I sent their prior to the latest one.
