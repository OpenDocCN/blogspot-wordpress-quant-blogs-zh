- en: Why do we tend to see larger deal sizes on dealer to client ECNs like [TradeWeb](http://www.tradeweb.com)
    than we do on interdealer ECNs like [MTS](http://www.euromts-ltd.com/) ?  As usual
    [Harris](http://www.tradingandexchanges.com/) is illuminating in chapter 15, on
    block traders.

- en: When a dealer is approached by a trader demanding liquidity in large size, he
    will suspect that trader of being better informed. After all, if you’re a well
    informed trader about to place a winning trade, wouldn’t you size up the deal
    to maximise winnings ? The dealer will worry that if he takes the trade, prices
    will move against him, and he’ll lose money on a position he can’t unwind. He’ll
    also worry that the block may have been split up, and there may be more large
    trades to follow. So any dealer taking a large trade must be sure that his counterparty
    is less well informed. This isn’t a problem on quote driven markets, where we
    know the counterparty identity when handling an RFQ. But that can’t be the case
    on a market organised as an anonymous order driven exchange…
