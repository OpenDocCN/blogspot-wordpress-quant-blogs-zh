    such as China, Europe, Russia-Ukraine, Ebola, etc. I have seen little discussion
    of the likely impact of the November electoral results on the markets. Therefore
    the election of a Republican controlled House and Senate, which are considered
    to be more business friendly than the Democrats, should provide a bullish boost
    for the stock market in early November. The response from the Barron`s Big Money
    Poll is confirms this view.

    flavor of the gridlock that has prevailed since the 2010 election. The split between
    Congress and the White House would still exist and, while Republicans would set
    the agenda in both chambers if they held a majority, a degree of bipartisan support
    would still be necessary in the Senate light of the 60-vote threshold necessary
    to pass most legislation.

    to it. The budget resolution sets out annual targets for federal spending, revenue,
    and debt. More importantly, it can be used to clear a procedural path for legislation
    that includes policies to reconcile the level of spending, revenue, or debt under
    current law with the levels in the budget resolution. Such “reconciliation” legislation
    is not subject to filibuster and can therefore pass both chambers with only a
    simple majority (i.e., 51 votes in the Senate).

    major fiscal deadlines. Since the confrontation between House Republicans and
    the White House over the debt limit in 2011, markets have gradually become inured
    to fiscal brinksmanship, as these debates have started to follow a predictable
    pattern. If Republicans win majorities in both chambers as polls currently suggest
    they might, that pattern seems likely to change, which could lead to renewed uncertainty
    ahead of future fiscal deadlines.

    don't be so quick to celebrate. Be aware of another looming Washington budget
    crisis early next year.
