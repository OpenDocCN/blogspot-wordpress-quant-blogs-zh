    Marcus Aurelius and Seneca. It basically says to work on things consistent with
    one's abilities and opportunities, not worrying about things we can't change,
    and develop satisfaction in doing your best. Thus, it embodies the idea that virtue
    is its own reward, but ties virtues to reality, where one works on things that
    matter and have objectively positive effects, at least statistically.

    of restraining one's desires. I think there is something to having big dreams
    and wanting to win competitions that seems not only natural, but satisfying as
    a goal to guide my actions.

    individuals, like working in competitive environments. This is a nice counterbalance
    to the stoic/buddist/new age(?) idea that we should just restrain our ambitions.
    The old saw that we need moderation in all things is just as applicable towards
    ambition, in that we don''t need zero, but some positive amount, and this is a
    nice corrective.'

    and Harvard and all sorts of august institutions, and I always thought: I''m going
    to find Mozart at one of these places. It turns out, in my career, I''ve never
    found a Mozart. The Mozart of economics or of politics or of writing theatrical
    works. What I find is we''ve got a lot of Salieris out there trying to pluck out
    a reasonable tune. And that''s probably good enough.'

    just bright people working hard on problems they find interesting, and getting
    a little lucky. Magicians only exist in different times and places because we
    don't really know them and it's a nice fantasy.
