    since the portfolio’s February 16^(th) inception – a full 14.9% better than the
    0.85% return of the benchmark S&P 500 index during this period.

- en: While some portfolio managers may be content to dial down their aggressiveness
    and coast in to the end of the year with an index-beating performance all but
    locked up, this automated portfolio has no such feature.  Instead, it will continue
    to try to squeeze out additional percentage points during the final two weeks
    of the year.  Given the current state of the markets, this could be riskier than
    most years, but this approach also happens to reflect my personal philosophy that
    it is generally best to press one’s advantage when things are going well.
