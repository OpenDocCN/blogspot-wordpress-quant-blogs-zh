- en: The idea was simple. Instead of sorting by vol, they sorted by vol of vol, and
    generate a rather large annualized return  difference (10%) between the high vs.
    low vol-of-vol buckets. It's a bit like the guys at Gillette coming out

    pretty obvious extension of the well-known low vol premium, and plan to investigate
    further. Clearly vol-of-vol is correlated with vol, so it would be interesting
    to see how these variables relate to each other in explaining the now well-known
    low-volatility premium. Perhaps volatility is a poor man's estimate of the 'true'
    factor, vol-of-vol, or vol-of-vol-of-vol.

- en: There were several interesting papers, and I noticed that as usual, the risk
    premium (aka 'price of risk) was usually negative. Now, the risk premium should
    be positive, a premium, but empirically is usually negative; I don't think that
    word doesn't means what they think it means. I think it's better to say, here
    are excess returns, controlling for various obvious alternative characteristics
    we know to be correlated with excess returns.
