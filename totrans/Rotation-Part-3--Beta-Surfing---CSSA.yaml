    and private commentary (both good and bad) as it makes for better educational/entertainment
    value for all of us. So feel free to speak you mind—–I always like to have a little
    constructive debate now and then. Now getting back to the article, for those who
    do not know what beta is–it is best described as a leverage factor to the S&P500:
    that is when the S&P500 goes up, a high beta stock/ETF will go higher than the
    S&P500, and the reverse is true if the index falls.'

    point out what the underlying source of alpha is in the rotation model. A reader–George–asked
    the question that is in fact part of the answer. Without paraphrasing, George
    essentially asked whether the model returns were being driven largely by going
    long EEM in bull markets and short the market during bear markets via SH. Truthfully,
    in fact a good rotation model is sort of like an alchemy experiment: **we take
    beta and we turn it into alpha**. While the ideal situation is to trade alpha
    (ie switching between good risk-adjusted systems), there is certainly a benefit
    to surfing the beta wave all the way to the bank. This strange sleight of hand
    is difficult to see, so I have prepared a little example that is easy to follow.
    Below, I use the defensive and low-beta consumer staples sector–ticker “XLP” (beta
    of .65)and the offensive and higher-beta consumer discretionary sector–ticker
    “XLY” (beta of .91). This pair represents an ideal test because statistically,
    they both share a low correlation and have different betas. Furthermore, they
    should have different “inherent” correlations and betas that are driven by their
    conceptually different relationships to the business cycle. When the market forecasts
    a strong economy, the smart money expects that consumers will have plenty of discretionary
    money and will probably purchase big-ticket items. Since XLY contains many of
    the largest companies within this sector, it should be the first to go up if their
    is confidence in consumer purchasing power. In contrast, if the market fears a
    recession or a slowdown, it is expected that consumers will be facing a pinch,
    and the only money spent will be on “staple” goods like food and cleaning products.
    Thus XLP should outperform if this is the case. In this test I will again use
    ETF Rewind’s Rotation model. This is a 3-year frictionless backtest, with no commissions,
    and weekly rebalancing. Again, I’m using XLP and XLY only. Below are three columns–the
    rotation model performance, and the buy and hold performance of XLY and XLP. Lets
    look at the results:'

    XLY or XLP, futhermore—and more relevant to what I was saying, the sharpe ratio
    or risk-adjusted return is .4, which is also higher than either one. So effectively
    the rotation model was able to utilize superior timing to harness the power of
    beta which is a form of embedded leverage. **When the timing is correct the return
    relative to volatility is temporarily higher than normal, hence you actually end
    up with alpha.**

    index and EEM–the emerging markets index. In recent past EEM (with a beta of 1.49)
    has done better in bull market conditions, while SPY (beta of 1) has done better
    when the market has been falling.

    risk-adjusted terms to its components. We have successfully surfed the beta wave
    once again and emerged without any major wipeouts.

    generate a higher alpha. The most interesting conclusion that comes out of this
    analysis is as follows: **If we can profitably trade beta, that also means that
    we can identify when we should be taking more or less risk in the market even
    if we are not trading the ETFs above!!** Note that the only adjustment we would
    have to make is to create a list of ETFs that span the “beta spectrum” that also
    have commensurate “inherent” betas (intuitive long-term levels of expected beta).
    In today’s market, the following ETFs make up an accurate spectrum of risk: SPY,
    EEM, SH, XLY, XLP, SHY. Note that unlike in the previous post, these choices are
    much more correlated–but that is by design. What we want to do is to figure out
    how aggressive we should be in our trading: should we be long, in cash, heavily
    long or short. In the case of this model we will have six “gears” so to speak.
    To reflect the “neutral” or zero beta component, using modern portfolio theory
    we would want a proxy for cash–and SHY is a pretty good substitute with a beta
    of 0.03 (note SHV– the t-bill proxy is actually the most accurate but has a lower
    yield and a less liquidity than SHY). For a negative beta component we will use
    SH which is the Short S&P500 ETF. All of the others are self explanatory. In the
    following model below, think of the race car analogy where the driver can shift
    the gearbox from first gear to third gear and higher, while also being able to
    shift into neutral and even reverse.'

    over 1, which indicates that it is pretty accurate at identifying when to “shift
    gears.” The point of this model is not to be a standalone rotation model–even
    though the numbers are pretty good–but rather to help the stock investor or trader
    make risk allocation decisions and determine a directional bias to maximize their
    returns and minimize their risk.
