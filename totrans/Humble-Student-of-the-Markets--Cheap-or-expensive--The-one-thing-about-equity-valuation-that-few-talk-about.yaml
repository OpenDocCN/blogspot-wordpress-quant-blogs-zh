    CAPE) no longer matter because accounting standards have changed and the stock
    market is still going up. However, the impact of elevated valuations -- when it
    really matters -- is expressed when the business cycle peaks and the next recession
    rolls around. Elevated valuations do not take a toll on portfolios so long as
    the economy is in expansion.
