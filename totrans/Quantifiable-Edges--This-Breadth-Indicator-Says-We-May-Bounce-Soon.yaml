- en: One indicator I watch is the 10-period EMA of Up Issues / (Up Issues + Down
    Issues). When it gets extremely low it normally signals the market is oversold
    and likely to bounce. On Monday it crossed below 0.36\. Below is a study showing
    how the market has performed other times the indicator has dropped this low.
