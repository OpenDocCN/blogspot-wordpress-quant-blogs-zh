    sacrificed himself for the Sins of Humanity. You don't necessarily have to be
    Christian, or even religious, to consider these questions. You just have to consider
    the trade-offs between the ideas of self-sacrifice and self-interest.

    arrangements in which market insiders take advantage of everybody else. Capitalism

    man has no right to exist for his own sake, that service to others is the only
    justification of his existence, and that self-sacrifice is his highest moral duty,
    virtue and value.

    of others. These are not primaries, but consequences, which, in fact, altruism
    makes impossible. The irreducible primary of altruism, the basic absolute, is
    self-sacrifice—which means; self-immolation, self-abnegation, self-denial, self-destruction—which
    means: the self as a standard of evil, the selfless as a standard of the good.'

    on Wall Street are primarily motivated to make money. While not everyone is cut
    from that mold, but Wall Street does have more than its fair share of people for
    whom avarice is the primary motivation. I can say that it is the purest embodiment
    of capitalism in its rawest form. It attracts a lot of bright young men and women
    who hope to get paid well - and they do.

    a lot of young men (and a few young women) - the training of United States Marines.
    This story is about training people to be prepared for self-sacrifice, which is

    Either these recruits are unwitting pawns (as per Rand) and you would have to
    be either an idiot or desperate to enlist, or they are the noble representatives
    of the American citizenry and United States Marine Corp.'
