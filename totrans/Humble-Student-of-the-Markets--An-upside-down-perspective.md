# Humble Student of the Markets: An upside-down perspective

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2011/12/upside-down-perspective.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2011/12/upside-down-perspective.html#0001-01-01)

For a different perspective, it's always useful to look at a stock chart differently. Consider the following chart whose identifying labels have been removed, would you buy this stock?

The pattern certainly looks constructive. The "stock" has certainly been forming a wide saucer base and undergoing an uptrend. Would you buy it?

What about this next one?

This chart of this second "stock" is similar to the first one, except that the pattern is a little better developed inasmuch as it has broken out of resistance and undergoing a classic bullish

formation.

I don't want to keep everyone in suspense. The first chart is the Euro STOXX 50 viewed upside-down, which is the market's signal of the ongoing problems in the eurozone, and the second is the upside-down chart of the yield on 10-year Treasury Note (TNX), an indicator of the risk-off safety trade. Here I present the original charts, without further comments or annotations.

These charts have mixed messages as to the timing of a break. The inverted chart of TNX suggests that the time to tactically get defensive is now, while the chart of the Euro STOXX 50 indicates a breakdown is more likely in 1Q. Much could happen next week as we approach the

, but many obstacles remain.

My inner investor tells me to be afraid, very afraid. My inner trader tells me to be prepared for volatility in the next two weeks, which will see an ECB meeting, an EU summit and an FOMC meeting. Anything can happen in the short-term.
