    completely by switching to the Lombok route, shipping costs to Japan go up maybe
    13.5% over the Malacca route. In other words, less than half a penny a barrel

    to be predictive of higher magnitude market weakness. I would rule out scenario
    3 as there doesn`t seem to be a recession on the horizon, which is the catalyst
    for a major bear market. That leaves scenario 2, a 10-20% pullback, by default.

    of 2010 and 2011, both of which saw the market fall 15-20%. My M2 analysis last

    under the circumstances.

    need to see some conviction and follow-through in market moves. As the chart below
    shows, RSI(14) momentum remains range-bound and hasn`t shown either an overbought
    or oversold reading in weeks. A major fall in stock prices would involve a series
    of "bad" oversold readings where the markets get oversold and stays oversold.
    In addition, the % of SPX stocks showing bullish formations on point and figure
    charts should be cratering, which it hasn`t so far. At the very least, I would
    watch for the violation of the uptrend line at about 2085 (in purple). The next
    test is a violation of the first support level, which is roughly 2070, and a test
    and violation of the second major support at about 2040 before declaring that
    a major correction has begun.
