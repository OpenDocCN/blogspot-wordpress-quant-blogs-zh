    provocative and different this morning, yet I was surprised – and pleased – to
    see that Kurt Cobb of [Resource Insights](http://resourceinsights.blogspot.com/)
    beat me to the punch by several days.  In Sunday’s [Does Queuing Theory Explain
    Oil’s Wild Price Swings?](http://resourceinsights.blogspot.com/2008/08/does-queueing-theory-explain-oils-wild.html)
    Cobb draws upon queuing theory as a possible explanation for price swings that
    seem to be out of proportion to changes in supply and demand.'

- en: Up front I should say that the extent of my knowledge about [queuing theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queueing_theory)
    is limited to some brief exposure to the subject back in business school.  Still,
    that exposure made a significant impression on me, as one of the important takeaways
    was that a very small and seemingly insignificant change can quickly move a system
    from equilibrium to chaos.

    each line.  If one checker takes a 10 minute break, you would not expect that
    lines in the other nine lines would triple or quadruple in just a few minutes,
    but according to queuing theory, this scenario is quite likely.  Similarly, if
    customers are entering the store at a rate of one every 15 seconds, it doesn’t
    sound like a change in the rate to one customer every 14 seconds could impact
    lines to the degree that they go from two deep to ten deep before the 10 minute
    break is over, but once again, this is a plausible scenario.

- en: The mathematics of queuing theory (which I have no desire to delve into) explain
    how very small changes at the margin (i.e., number of checkers, average checkout
    time, customer arrival rate, etc.) can quickly move a system from equilibrium
    to bottleneck, with resulting wait times increasing exponentially.  It may be
    a little bit of a stretch to say that a grocery store is analogous to the world
    oil market, but I do think queuing theory provides a model for how small changes
    in input and output rates can create a massive bottleneck problem in a very short
    period of time.
