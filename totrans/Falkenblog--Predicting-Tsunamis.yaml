    to the world in 2011\. Of the political turmoil in the Middle East—the revolutionary
    movements in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Yemen, Bahrain, and Syria—we find no hint
    in The Economist‘s forecast. Nor do we find a word about the earthquake/tsunami
    and consequent disasters in Japan or the spillover effects on the viability of
    nuclear power around the world. Or the killing of Osama bin Laden and the spillover
    effects for al Qaeda and Pakistani and Afghan politics. So each of the top three
    global events of the first half of 2011 were as unforeseen by The Economist as
    the next great asteroid strike.

    specific outcomes that were unforeseen. But I would say that rather than this
    year being really crazy, it is rather similar to last year: US mired in Iraq and
    Afghanistan, deficits as far as the eye can see, no shovel-ready government spending,
    inner city America pathetic, Harvard outdoing Mississippi State academically,
    etc. Predicting broad trends is eminently doable but we often just take those
    for granted. Indeed, later they point out that experts tend to do worse than simple
    extrapolation models, which just highlights the futility of predicting outliers.
    So what should one do: predict specifics, or forecast broad trends that necessarily
    miss specifics?'

    was generally an exponential curve from where we are to the long-run historical
    average. But that's pretty boring, so we would add some little wiggles at the
    end based on some theory (A causes B which causes C in 18 months), because that
    kind of reasoning really resonated with the audience; they wanted to learn some
    new story to apply to their understanding of the world, something more novel than
    the future will be a lot like the past. Similarly, Tetlock appears to want tsunami
    forecasts, surely fun to have.

    an unfortunate tendency to work well until they don’t.' This, supposedly, is a
    deep thought. What Tetlock seems to lament is the absence of perfect foresight,
    because dominant approaches he finds poor. This isn't a very logical conclusion,
    because he is making the best the enemy of the good here.

    as if everyone else would not also choose this description, highlighting the futility
    of his schema. Tetlock greatly admires Nassim Taleb, another who, ironically,
    criticizes pundits who make lots of nonfalsifiable predictions and selectively
    report their record. I think this highlights Nietzsche's warning that 'He who
    fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster.'
    In other words, people who make a life out of criticizing overconfidence, dogma,
    hate, hypocrisy, are often filled with overconfidence, dogma, hate, and hypocrisy.
