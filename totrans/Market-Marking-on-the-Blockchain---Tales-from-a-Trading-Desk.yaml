- en: '[Ripple](https://ripple.com/solutions/ripple-for-market-makers/) offers Market
    Making though its blockchain based [network](https://ripple.com/blog/the-life-of-a-ripple-market-maker/).
     If I’m reading the marketing ware correctly, the market making is via the gateway
    servers, which leads me to wonder if the gateway servers offer (buy/sell bids)
    this feature (with only the trades being written to the blockchain), or the bids
    (buy/sell for notional buckets) are encoded into the blockchain via a smart contract.
     The second option is more interesting, especially when you look at this smart
    contract [Ballot](https://chriseth.github.io/browser-solidity/) sample, and also
    the simple banking [system](https://eng.erisindustries.com/tutorials/2015/03/11/solidity-1/)
    contract sample around account withdrawals.'
