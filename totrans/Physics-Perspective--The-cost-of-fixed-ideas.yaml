    the argument that some of the assumptions economists made many decades ago --
    especially about people having fixed preferences -- have effectively created a
    trap for policy analyses. We're stuck as a result with endless, useless arguments
    about markets versus government. Change those assumptions, and it's possible to
    imagine policies that don't have markets and government in opposition; it ought
    to be possible to have free markets and a useful and smaller government at the
    same time, and achieve not only material prosperity but a wide range of social
    goals too.

- en: a few days ago. That column has garnered all of 4 comments so far, which I think
    also illustrates another problem we have. The column is all about how we might
    find a way around all of the sterile arguments of markets vs government, and not
    too many people seem to be interested in that.... or at least not motivated to
    comment. From past experience, I know that any column which seems to take a side
    in those arguments stirs up a lot of protest.

- en: From financial regulation to health care to climate change, we can't agree on
    what to do about anything. Free-market enthusiasts celebrate the creative power
    of markets and want smaller government; critics counter that we desperately need
    government intervention to solve problems that markets can't handle. Neither side
    can understand the other.

    new book by an economist, David Colander, and a businessman, Roland Kupers, who
    believe the deadlock needn't be permanent. We can have better markets, they say,
    and more effective (and smaller) government too, if only we can muster a little
    more economic imagination.

    and its main point is that our policy debates have fallen into a trap that economists
    inadvertently created some 50 years ago. That's when they started building mathematical
    models of economic systems, and, to simplify things, made the assumption that
    people have fixed or unchanging preferences and desires. Sounds innocuous; it
    wasn't, and isn't.    [Read more.](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-06-24/is-there-a-way-to-escape-policy-gridlock)
