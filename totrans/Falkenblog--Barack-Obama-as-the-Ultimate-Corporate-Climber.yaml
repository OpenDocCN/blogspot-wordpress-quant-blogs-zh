    senator in Illinois, or in the US senate. At least McCain has McCain-Feingold,
    and Hillary has health care, and their failures in these areas are learning experiences
    that will make them better candidates. I'll take someone who has failed in a sincere
    effort that was reasonable at the time, over someone with zero experience any
    time, because the best attribute of leader of something with a not-obvious objective
    function is modest ambition, and nothing teaches modesty better than failure in
    previous panaceas.

- en: The problem with guys who merely talk reasonably, but have no record of achievement,
    is we have a tendency to infer an Olympian reasonableness and moderation to their
    views when they are conventionally successful. Yet many of these guys are merely
    afraid of looking stupid, so say little about anything controversial and relevant
    to their career. For example, I know several very successful people who have mastered
    the art of saying very little about actual business tactics. And if they find
    themselves in a group that is successful for reasons unrelated to their action
    (eg, a portfolio manager for telecom in the 1990s), most people assume they are
    very bright. You really have to have an insider's knowledge to know this, so you
    get this unalloyed praise out of ignorance of outsiders deferring to success,
    and self-interested flattery by ambitious insiders eager to form coalitions.

    take a risky view. Yet there are so many of these people, the fact that most successful
    executives in large organizations adopt this strategy does not mean it is optimal,
    because there are many such people mired in middle layers because their groups
    were not winners of accidental success in one's field, like people lucky to be
    in telecoms in the the 1990s. I would not advocate this strategy to someone young
    and smart, in spite of the fact that most successful politicians and businessmen
    adopt it, because those successful people are more like lottery winners than self-made
    men.

    articulating big ideas is helpful to the policy wonks who need to use these to
    rationalize their petty objectives. Really thoughtful policy tends to come from
    academics or journalists who first test them in the field, and so only after several
    decades of success, does one justify an idea based on Milton Friedman, who was

- en: But if you have no good novel ideas, and really no good opinion on current ideas,
    the following approach is recommended for moving up the corporate ladder. First,
    have strong opinions about things like sports and movies, and also have keen grasp
    of conspicuous historical events in your field (Obama took a bold pro-Bear position
    prior to last year's super bowl). So, in finance, if you read an insider's account
    of the dot-com bubble, the S&L crisis, or the Long Term Capital Management, you
    will appear to have a good, detailed knowledge. Never champion a new idea, or
    take a view on a current, controversial plan. You will only look foolish. Lastly,
    get a haircut every 2 weeks, and wear good clothes, paying special importance
    to shoes. Now, when people are looking for a new head of corporate development,
    you are perfect, because you have never made enemies, and you seem like a reasonable
    guy. People won't remember that you never have opinions on novel stuff, because
    their memory will be dominated by your strong opinions on irrelevancies, and your
    hindsight knowledge about the internet bubble shows a courageous and savvy insider's
    view (this is the key subtlety to the empty suit strategy, you need some camouflage).
    Then, inherit a bunch of projects, and manage them by merely listening quietly
    to your employees bitch about each other, by saying, 'don't worry, I'll take care
    of it', which means, 'I'll call them into a meeting and listen to them bitch about
    you'.

  zh: 但如果你没有好的新奇想法，而且对当前的想法也没有好的看法，那么推荐采取以下方法来晋升职场。首先，对于诸如体育和电影之类的事物要有强烈的看法，并且对你所在领域的显著历史事件要有敏锐的把握（奥巴马在去年超级碗前曾公开支持熊队）。因此，在金融领域，如果你读了一个内部人士关于互联网泡沫、储蓄与贷款危机或长期资本管理的描述，你将显得对知识有很好的、详细的了解。永远不要支持一个新观点，或者对当前有争议的计划表达看法。这只会让你看起来愚蠢。最后，每两周理发一次，穿好衣服，特别要注意鞋子的重要性。现在，当人们在寻找新的企业发展主管时，你是完美的人选，因为你从未结怨，看起来像个讲理的人。人们不会记得你从来没有对新奇事物表达过意见，因为他们的记忆将被你在无关紧要的事情上的强烈意见和你对互联网泡沫的事后了解所主导（这是空壳策略的关键微妙之处，你需要一些伪装）。然后，继承一大堆项目，并通过仅仅静静地听你的员工彼此抱怨来管理它们，然后说，“别担心，我会处理好的”，这意味着，“我会把他们叫到会议室里听他们抱怨你”。
