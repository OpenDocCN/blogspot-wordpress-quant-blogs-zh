    an ongoing site dedicated to posting internal DV Indicators research and future
    ideas/concepts. This blog will be maintained by Enn Kuutan–  who is currently
    enrolled in the CMT program and is a serious student of the markets.

- en: Markets go through different phases, bulls rule one month, bears the next. There
    are many different strategies to navigating the markets but following the long
    term trend in terms of the 200dma is a favourite that is helpful in maximizing
    profitability. Waiting for an oversold condition to enter positions is one way
    of getting on board. Here we are *looking at long trade entries above and below
    the 200dma* using **extremes in the DV2 oscillator, initiating on entries below
    20**. But what should be our exit criteria? Let’s look at the effects of time
    based exists, holding periods of 1-5,7,10,15 and 20 days. Hat tip to Rob Hanna
    of [Quantifiable Edges](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/) ([http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/)/)
    for inspiring the time based analysis and tables! To stick with what Rob typically
    does in his analysis, I used a fixed $10,000 bet size without reinvestment.

- en: Interestingly enough the long trades below the 200dma outperform those above
    the 200dma for short holding periods, presumably because of the high volatility
    and compressed cycle length associated with market conditions under the 200dma/in
    a bear market (see [https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2010/04/07/a-simple-adaptive-change-to-daily-follow-through-to-capture-cycle-changes/](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2010/04/07/a-simple-adaptive-change-to-daily-follow-through-to-capture-cycle-changes/)).
    However holding on to those entries above the 200dma leads to much higher gains
    per trade when holding above 7 days. The old ***Livermore*** saying ***“It never
    was my thinking that made the big money for me. It always was my sitting.”***
    comes to mind, but **only when the trend in a higher time frame is your friend**.

- en: 'Looking into the  risk-adjusted analysis details we see a fascinating picture
    emerge: as the holding period above the 200dma increases, the DVR, a measure of
    reward to risk which specifically is the linearity-adjusted Sharpe ratio, increases
    up to an optimal holding period of 10 days while below the 200dma the DVR peaks
    at 2 days and deteriorates rapidly. This is exactly what you would expect trading
    counter to the trend.'

  zh: 查看风险调整分析细节，我们看到一个迷人的画面：随着持有期在200dma以上增加，DVR，一种衡量风险和收益的指标，特别是线性调整的夏普比率，增加到10天的最佳持有期，而在200dma以下，DVR在2天时达到峰值，并迅速恶化。这正是您期望的与趋势相反交易。

- en: Looking at another measure of reward to risk, the Win/Loss ratio we see the
    same effect, although in a less pronounced fashion than with looking at the DVR.
