    is named after its originators, [Sherman and Marion McClellan](http://www.mcoscillator.com/about.html),
    who developed this indicator in 1969\. This index and its counterpart, the McClellan
    Oscillator, are tools for evaluating trends in market breadth (advancing issues
    minus declining issues) and should be in every investor’s toolbox.'

    with the Oscillator data presented in a manner better suited to short and intermediate
    term trading and the Summation Index targeted at identifying changes in the longer
    term trend. For a more detailed discussion of the specific calculations involved,

- en: With this indicator, I prefer to take a longer term view of the markets and
    therefore have included below a weekly chart of the McClellan Summation Index
    (also generically know as the NYSE Summation Index) going back to 2003\. A glance
    at the chart shows that in the rally from the 2002 lows, the Summation Index has
    done an excellent job of calling both highs and lows in advance of market turns,
    with a 2-3 month warning for market highs and a much tighter warning period for
    lows. Also note that these highs and lows have tended to fall into a pattern of
    7-12 month cycles over the past few years.

    it is doing a good job of calling market turns.

- en: As for the current Summation Index readings and what it augurs for the markets
    in the second quarter and beyond, the fact that the Summation Index is sitting
    right at the 39 week SMA tells me that we are more likely to be range-bound at
    least in the short term than moving sharply higher or lower.
