- en: For the second week in a row, at least one Portfolio A1 holding fell 10% during
    the week.  Last week it was [Tesoro (TSO)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=tso&hl=en),
    which continued to recover this week; the most recent victim is [Rock-Tenn (RKT)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=rkt&hl=en),
    whose fall was offset almost imperceptibly by a $0.10 dividend paid out on 5/21.  While
    RKT has been a strong performer since being added to the portfolio during the
    first week in March, the recent weakness makes this holding vulnerable to being
    dropped in the coming weeks.
