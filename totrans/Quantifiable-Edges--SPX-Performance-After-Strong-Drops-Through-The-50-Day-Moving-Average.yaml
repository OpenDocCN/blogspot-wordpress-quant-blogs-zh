     And it did so with both breadth and volume providing exclamation marks.  Such
    breaks of highly public support lines like the 50-day moving average can be notable
    (and it certainly drew attention on Thursday).  Some traders may view it as a
    change in trend.  And while it may be when looking out over a period of days,
    weeks, or months, the immediate 1-day reaction to such moving average breaks has
    typically been to bounce.  This can be seen in the study below.

    closing higher today.  The average instance gained about 0.6% on the day.
