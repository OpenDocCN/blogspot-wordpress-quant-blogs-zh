    invariably fails to think about enough and properly address in their trading methodology.
    Interestingly, risk management is often the Achilles heel of more experienced
    traders who know better, but also fail to attend to with sufficient rigor.

    an excellent treatment of the subject. I am slightly partial to Mamis here, but

    seeking better entries, my suggestion is to try both of them.
