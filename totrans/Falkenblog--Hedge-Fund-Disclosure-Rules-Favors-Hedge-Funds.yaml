    regulation: capture. Under the pretext of justice or fairness, the SEC routinely
    hurts the unorganized plebians vs. the insiders. Consider that it''s first commissioner
    was Joe Kennedy, who made his first fortune off then-legal bucket shop trading
    tactics. The SEC then sat on a monopoly on equity trading, and mandated commission
    rates for decades, as well as preventing all sorts of competition. You might remember
    the SEC in penalizing famous frauds like Madoff, Bayou, and Wood River--after
    they were exposed as frauds by their own investors. These are the police who show
    up after you''ve tackled and hog-tied your intruder, and then take credit for
    putting him in jail.'

  zh: 美国证券交易委员会（SEC）很好地展示了一个监管中的大问题：捕获。在正义或公平的幌子下，SEC 经常伤害无组织的平民，而偏袒内部人士。考虑到其首任委员是乔·肯尼迪，他通过当时合法的投机交易所交易策略赚得了第一桶金。SEC
    随后垄断了股票交易，并规定了数十年的佣金率，同时阻止了各种竞争。你可能还记得 SEC 在惩罚像马多夫、海湾和伍德河这样的著名欺诈行为——这些欺诈行为在被自己的投资者揭露后才受到惩罚。这些警察在你制服并捆绑了入侵者之后才出现，然后声称是他们将其送进监狱。

    1989 年之前的那些社会主义经济学教授通常更喜欢社会主义一样。当一个实体失败时，他们忽视其各种附属基金，因为那真的不是一个“基金”，而且它并不是 X 的一部分，这有什么令人惊讶的吗？

    would still be illegal, so, truth telling by those with good returns would be
