    regulation: capture. Under the pretext of justice or fairness, the SEC routinely
    hurts the unorganized plebians vs. the insiders. Consider that it''s first commissioner
    was Joe Kennedy, who made his first fortune off then-legal bucket shop trading
    tactics. The SEC then sat on a monopoly on equity trading, and mandated commission
    rates for decades, as well as preventing all sorts of competition. You might remember
    the SEC in penalizing famous frauds like Madoff, Bayou, and Wood River--after
    they were exposed as frauds by their own investors. These are the police who show
    up after you''ve tackled and hog-tied your intruder, and then take credit for
    putting him in jail.'

    investors'' (those making less that $200k per year and are not worth $1MM). This
    only helps the fraudsters and inhibits competition, and makes investing more complicated.
    If people knew about Madoff''s record many would have highlighted its patent impossibility:
    you simply could not have generated that kind of return record doing what he said
    he was doing, and many an assistant professor would have loved demonstrating this.'

    it is not merely discouraged, but illegal! This supposedly helps the widow who
    might be tempted by the siren song of hedge fund jingles, but any stripper knows
    that coy concealment titillates much more than brazen reality. Fund X made 100%
    in 2008? I must find out! The fund's insiders abet the misinformation

    The hedge fund indices themselves have repeatedly been found to contain survivorship

    than potential clients, because the funds are not obligated to give them their
    returns. You don't become an expert in something, without being an advocate in
    some way, just as all those socialist economics professors pre-1989 generally
    preferred socialism. Is it surprising they neglect various subsidiary funds of
    an entity when it fails, because that really wasn't a 'fund', and it wasn't really
    part of X?

    would still be illegal, so, truth telling by those with good returns would be
    a dominant strategy, and silent firms would look bad because they probably aren't
    talking for a reason. This would give investors more information about the risks
    and opportunities available to them.
