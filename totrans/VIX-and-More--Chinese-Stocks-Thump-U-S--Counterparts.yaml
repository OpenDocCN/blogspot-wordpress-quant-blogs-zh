- en: The chart below shows the performance of [FXI](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/FXI),
    the [iShares FTSE/Xinhua China 25 Index](http://www.ishares.com/product_info/fund/overview/FXI.htm),
    for 2010\. Note that while much hoopla has been generated over the new 2010 highs
    in the S&P this week, FXI has repeatedly been making new highs for the year since
    the beginning of October and is now approximately 10% above previous highs.

    the S&P 500 index consistently going all the way back to the May 6^(th) flash
    crash.

- en: I have previously talked about thinking of China as a possible leading indicator
    for U.S. stocks. Recent data suggests that investors may want to give additional
    thought about the predictive power of Chinese stocks and reorient some of their
    geographic bias.
