    15 months. It basically sold short any time there were 2 up days and looked to
    exit at the 1st profitable close on or before day 4 – at which time it would exit
    no matter what. Incidentally, today’s drop would’ve been yet another winner for
    the system.

    over that time period. Fairly amazing is how a long-oriented system based on the
    same ideas can output numbers nearly as good. Below are system criteria reminiscent
    of last week’s studies:'

    on the close of day 3 regardless of profitability.

    not a well-designed trading system. Entry and exit techniques are too raw for
    actual decision making.

    a row going back to February and the market has seen a difficult time during that
    period.

    the short-side. Those that are already short may want to consider taking profits.
    Traders could also begin thinking long in the next day or so.
