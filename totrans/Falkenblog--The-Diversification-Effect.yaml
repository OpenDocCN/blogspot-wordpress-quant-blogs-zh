    line, the average return of the average commodity futures was not statistically
    different from zero. Alternatively, the average commodity futures had an average
    geometric “risk premium” of zero.

- en: where k is the number of positions. Harvey and Erb call this 'turning water
    into wine', because in futures, a portfolio of futures with individual geometric
    returns of 0, can rise to 4.5%, merely by equal weighting the futures (or thereabouts).
    I guess this is pretty trivial given that a geometric return is the arithmetic
    return minus the variance divided by 2 (approximately), but then again, all mathematics
    is a riff on tautologies.
