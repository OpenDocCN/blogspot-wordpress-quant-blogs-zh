    Galton's original observation on the heights of parents and their children, and
    much of the book involves the concept of bayesian updating. These aren't new ideas.
     Yet, when he noted that while small schools are overrepresented in data on excellent
    and really bad schools, it reminded me that this is a real problem because invariably
    they are used as templates for some system-wide initiative, neglecting the fact
    that often some very unique circumstances as opposed to any efficient method are
    at work. Like everyone, I need reminding of some of these patterns sometimes.

- en: The author recounts a fortunate interview he had with Drexel back in the days
    this was one of the most coveted positions out of college. He astutely noticed
    the senior interviewer had a Redskins trash can and so mentioned something casually
    about football, after which the interview went extremely well, talking mainly
    about football.  Clearly, that wasn't just luck, but after the fact appeared the
    key to him getting hired, creating a career path that would never be the same.

    authors so I found all that very interesting.  Some of his other inspirations
    I'm less fond about. He calls Peter Bernstein 'one of the investment industry's
    greatest thinkers', though I'm at a loss as to what Bernstein insight might deserve
    such praise.  And then he mentions my favorite flâneur, Nassim Taleb, and suggests
    his great insight is that when payoffs are uncertain and complex, these are great
    situations to go long, specifically, go long out-of-the-money options.
