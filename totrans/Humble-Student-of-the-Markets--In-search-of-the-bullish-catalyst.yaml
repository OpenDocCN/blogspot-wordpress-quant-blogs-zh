    at these levels, the S&P 500 was trading at a forward P/E of 14-16\. The current
    forward P/E is 16.8, which is slightly above that range. In order for stock prices
    to rise, at least one of two things has to happen. Either the discount rate has
    to fall, which expands P/E ratios, or earnings have to rise.
