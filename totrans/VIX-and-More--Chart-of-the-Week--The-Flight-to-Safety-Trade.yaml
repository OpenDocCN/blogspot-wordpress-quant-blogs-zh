    looks at some of the various flight-to-safety trades that investors have been
    taking advantage of since the recent closing high of 1217 in the S&P 500 index

    and then the dollar ([UUP](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/UUP)) peaked
    as hedges against stock declines. More recently, [U.S. Treasuries](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Treasury%20Note)
    have been the favored flight-to-safety vehicle, with the long bond ETF ([TLT](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TLT))
    outperforming the other two alternatives and shorter-term Treasury ETFs such as
    [IEF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/IEF), not shown, attracting
    quite a few buyers.

    (iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN), which is more of a hedge than a flight-to-safety
    alternative. During the last month VXX is up 81.3%, with a volatility level of
    113.6.
