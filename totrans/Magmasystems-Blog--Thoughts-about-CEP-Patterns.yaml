- en: How do you do transactions in the context of event processing? For example,
    if I get an event, we might trigger some units-of-work and generate some more
    derived events from this initial event. These derived events might be put into
    the event cloud.

- en: If one of the units-of-work fail, how do we rollback the "transaction"? Do we
    need to define compensating events? Do we need to suck the derived events out
    of the event cloud? Do we need to attach "state" to the derived events which signal
    whether they are part of a transaction?

    can the transactions patterns in the DBMS world be applied to CEP?

- en: Another thing I have been interested in is the generation of recursive events.
    If I get an event and generate a derived event, how do I know that this derived
    event will not result in recursion? Again, DBMS vendors have run into the same
    situation with database triggers, and some lessons can be learned.

- en: So, does this mean that we are better off considering a CEP vendor who has roots
    in the DBMS world?

    but it gives you an idea about the things that any of you who are implementing
    CEP might have to consider...)
