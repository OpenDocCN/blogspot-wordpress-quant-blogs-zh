    illustrate the relationship I’ve created a chart below. In red is the closing
    prices of the S&P 500\. The blue is closing prices of UDN, which is the US Dollar
    Bearish Fund ETF.

    Since UDN is a bearish fund this means that the S&P has actually moved opposite
    the dollar. A weak dollar has been cause for celebration and a strong dollar has
    closely preceded most of the drops in the S&P.

- en: But can the performance in the dollar provide a trading edge in the S&P? Below
    is the equity curve of an incredibly simple system. If UDN outperforms SPX on
    the day, go long SPX at the close. If UDN underperforms, go short SPX at the close.
    Basically you’re either 100% long or 100% short depending on how the dollar (inverse)
    performed that day relative to the SPX. For purposes of the test, no commissions
    or slippage are included.

- en: That’s more than an 82% non-compounded gain over the last 18 months. This edge
    won’t last forever. Still, this should demonstrate that the correlation between
    the dollar and the S&P is important. Moves in the dollar have a definite impact
    on the S&P. S&P traders would be well served to monitor the dollar’s performance
    closely and on an ongoing basis.
