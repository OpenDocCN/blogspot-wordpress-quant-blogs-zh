- en: If Gold and the stock market are both geometric brownian motion, what are the
    odds of this pattern? It looks like there's a clear trend from when the US closed
    the gold window in 1971 to 1981 when the monetarist experiment ended, to the end
    of the internet bubble, then to today.

- en: Gold peaked in 1980, and basically is at a peak again, but it's interesting
    that this ratio seems stationary. I bet no one thought that was true in 1980,
    or even 2001.

    I've seen papers argue gold has a positive, negative, and zero expected return,
    reflecting what has happened over the past 10 years.

- en: that seems pretty interesting...basically, when the real interest rate is low,
    gold is relatively attractive and generates good returns as investors pile in.
