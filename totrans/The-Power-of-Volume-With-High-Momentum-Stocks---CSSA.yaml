- en: The following chart shows the impact of using only the 5-day volume change or
    ROC of volume to trade the  Livermore Top 10 unhedged.  As you can see, the returns
    and risk-adjusted returns are very impressive for such a simple condition–exceeding
    the returns from buying using other simple conditions such as up/down days or
    buying on 5-day ROC<0.  I have not had much time to do thorough research, but
    it appears so far that consistent with practitioner theory–volume is a big key
    to timing high momentum stocks.
