    matching engine. When Nasdaq heard of this agreement, they contacted Verizon demanding
    to be the sole marketplace offering trading services in Nordic equities in Lunda.
    Nasdaq told Verizon that if Verizon allocated space to the Burgundy matching engine
    at their data centre in Lunda, Nasdaq would remove their own primary matching
    engine and their co-location service from that centre. Such an agreement with
    Burgundy/Cinnober could also have an impact on Verizon’s global collaboration

- en: In the US, a lot of people are upset that equity exchanges are located all over
    New Jersey, instead of being in one building. Michael Lewis’s primary complaint
    about HFT is that it engages in “latency arbitrage” by sending orders between
    market centers ahead of anticipated institutional trades. I suspect that, in addition
    to those concerned about latency arbitrage, most HFTs would also be happy if important
    exchanges moved to one place. That would cut participants’ expenses significantly;
    there would be no need to host computers (and backups) at multiple locations and
    no need to procure expensive fiber and wireless links between locations. It would
    also allow HFTs to trade a given security on multiple exchanges from a single
    computer, dramatically simplifying risk checks and eliminating accidental self-trading.

    reasonable for that system to negotiate as a single entity, and for the other

  zh: 一个解决方案可能是让金融业监管局（FINRA）在假设长期合同的情况下向提供商征求报价，为新交易所和交易员提供额外空间——为所有人降低成本。这一提议与第一点中的担忧相矛盾，但我想知道，因为我们有一个单一的国家市场体系，这个系统作为一个单一实体进行协商，并且其他担忧是否应该重写第一点。交易所不再从共同托管服务中赚取太多利润，但他们可以通过提高交易费来补偿这一点，这从某种程度上来说对市场来说可能更健康。
- en: In my mind, what separates data centers from utilities is that, for most of
    their non-financial customers, there’s very little benefit to being in a certain
    building versus a nearby one. So long as nearby buildings have good connectivity
    to the local internet, customers have many options when procuring hosting services.
    Financial customers are much different. Once a major exchange is located in a
    certain building, traders, and sometimes competing exchanges, have no choice but
    to lease space there. That feels to me like a completely different dynamic, and
    possibly one that justifies data centers, in this specific industry, being classified
    as utilities.

  zh: 在我看来，数据中心与公用事业的区别在于，对于大多数非金融客户来说，进驻某个特定建筑与附近建筑相比并没有太大好处。只要附近建筑与当地互联网连接良好，客户在采购托管服务时有很多选择。金融客户则大不相同。一旦主要交易所设在某个特定建筑内，交易员，有时甚至是竞争交易所，别无选择只能在那里租用空间。这对我来说感觉就像是完全不同的动态，可能正是这种动态在这个特定行业中将数据中心归类为公用事业的理由之一。
