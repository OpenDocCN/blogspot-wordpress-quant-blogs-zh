    for [pointing out](http://alephblog.com/?p=27) that with the VIX up 21% and the
    SPX down 1.5%, the ratio of the two moves is -14, well above the typical -8 to
    -10 range.

    to the fundamental events that are driving them and should serve as a reminder
    that the current environment is in no way as dire as some of the past crises that
    have caused the VIX to spike 20%.  In fact, the magnitude of today’s move may
    be as much a result of the coiled spring effect (number of days without a 2% correction,
    etc.) or the volume of the recent bear drumbeat as any fundamental changes in
    the Chinese economy, geopolitical issues, US durable goods and the like.
