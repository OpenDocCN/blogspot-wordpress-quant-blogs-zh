    sideswipe emerging markets. While it's nice to be ahead of the curve, it seems
    that the problems currently faced by selected EM currencies are due to local conditions,
    e.g. the problems in Argentina are unrelated to the problems in Turkey, and the
    risk of a global EM currency crisis sparked by Fed tapering is well under control.

    as EM tail-risk doesn't seem to be of a global catastrophic nature.

    with only one brief correction amounting to 9.6% early that year. There was a
    more significant correction of 19.3% in 1998 after the Russian ruble crisis and
    mostly in reaction to the collapse of LTCM. Yet the S+P 500 rose 26.7% that year.

    markets crisis is bearish for the US stock market isn’t confirmed by the experience
    of 1997\. Recessions are bearish for stocks. So far, it’s hard to see how the
    current emerging markets crisis triggers a recession in the US.

- en: In emerging market economies, increased financial market and capital flow volatility
    remain a concern given that the Fed will start tapering in early 2014\. The responses
    to the related December announcement have been relatively muted in most economies,
    possibly helped by the Fed’s policy communication and re-calibration (including
    revisions to forward guidance). Nevertheless, portfolio shifts and some capital
    outflows are likely with Fed tapering. When combined with domestic weaknesses,
    the result could be sharper capital outflows and exchange rate adjustments.

    US junk bonds (HYG) as a measure of risk appetite in EM (EM junk vs. US junk).
    Despite all the hoopla about EM economies are tanking, the EMB/HYG ratio has tested
    and held a key relative support level.

    CEW is also testing a key technical support level and support has held, so far.

    rates from 7.5% to 12%, which was much higher than Street expectations of 10%,
    and we are seeing a risk-on rally. Nevertheless, these are two key indicators
    of whether EM economies may have caught Taperitis.
