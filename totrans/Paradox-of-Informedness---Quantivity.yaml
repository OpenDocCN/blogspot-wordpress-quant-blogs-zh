- en: This deceptively simple sounding question has deep, far reaching implications
    for building quantitative models and high-frequency trading systems. Although
    many people have speculated on this question for decades, the discipline of [econophysics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Econophysics)
    is applying techniques originating from statistical physics (originally [statistical
    mechanics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_mechanics)) to provide insight
    into this fundamental question.

- en: Econophysics frames this question in the context of *investor informedness*,
    which is a means of measuring whether the average trade has better than random
    chance (50/50) to be profitable. Interesting papers in this literature include
    Fluctuations and Response in Financial Markets by Bouchaud *et al.* and Are Supply
    and Demand Driving Stock Prices? by Hopman.

- en: The vast majority of trades are empirically proven to be uninformed (meaning
    they are based upon random buy/sell decisions), yet microstructure models tell
    us price is determined by the historical sequence of preceding trades. Thus, trades
    are uninformed, yet form the basis for subsequent price discovery.

- en: In other words, *trades are simultaneously uninformed and informed*. This is
    deeply unsettling for those (presumably few, given the past two years) believing
    in rational agents and Efficient Market Hypothesis.

    providers with intraday time horizons, might 30% prices jumps indeed simply be
    non-collusive jumping and dumping on a macro timescale?
