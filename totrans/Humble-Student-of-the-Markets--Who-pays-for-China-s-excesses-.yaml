    a provider of low cost labor to become a global manufacturing giant. Her growth
    was also fueled by an infrastructure boom, initially to upgrade facilities like
    transportation, etc., which then morphed into a property boom because local savers
    had nowhere else to put their funds. Today, we are now faced with the specter
    of the see-through apartment buildings, empty shopping malls and white elephant,
    but spanking new, airport, railway and port facilities sprinkled throughout the
    country.

    in infrastructure. But the investment boom seems overdone even compared to the
    record of other rapidly developing economies. This chart below from Pictet shows
    that Japan's investment as a percentage of GDP peaked out at 36% in 1973, South
    Korea peaked at 38% in 1991 and China recently peaked at a staggering 46% in 2010,
    but levels remain elevated.

    saver had no real outlet for his savings because of the under-developed nature
    of China's debt and equity markets, poured his funds into real estate, fueling

    unique and for which there are many historical precedents, is usually wealth enhancing
    in its early stages, and then becomes wealth destroying once capital is systematically
    misallocated. When that happens, debt rises at an unsustainable pace until we
    reach debt capacity limits, in which case the country will have a debt crisis.
    I have usually estimated that it would reach debt capacity limits around 2016-18
    but now I think it is likely to happen earlier.
