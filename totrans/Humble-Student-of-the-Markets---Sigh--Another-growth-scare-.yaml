    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    of business momentum. Sometimes a stock is falling simply because investors are
    taking profits after its outperformance or because a portfolio is changing its
    risk profile in a volatile market. There are countless reasons why share prices
    move.

    the underperformance of a large swath of the U.S. stock market means that most

    It could also mean that there are a lot of buying opportunities in undervalued
    companies, ones that have a much better business than is widely believed.'
