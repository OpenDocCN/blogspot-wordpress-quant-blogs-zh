    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    of business momentum. Sometimes a stock is falling simply because investors are

    the underperformance of a large swath of the U.S. stock market means that most

    companies, ones that have a much better business than is widely believed.'
