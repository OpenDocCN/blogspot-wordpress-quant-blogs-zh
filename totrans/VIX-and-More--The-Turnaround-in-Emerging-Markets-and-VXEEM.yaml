    yesterday I was delighted to be able to pinch hit for Steve Sears of Barron’s

    [risk](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/risk) in [emerging markets](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/emerging%20markets)
    during January was largely responsible for the 31.7% [VIX spike](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20spikes)
    on January 24, but was nowhere near the levels of June 2013, at least as measured
    by the CBOE Emerging Markets Volatility Index ([VXEEM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXEEM)).

    emerging markets have likely bottomed and are poised for a bounce. I concluded
    the Barron’s column with a couple of options trade ideas to take advantage of
    a reversal in emerging markets.

    much a case of going out on limb. By Friday’s publication date, which includes
    Tuesday’s option pricing data, emerging markets had already experienced a significant
    bounce and my emerging markets thesis no doubt sounded much less provocative than
    it would have three days earlier.

    and VXEEM bear close watching going forward, as the Fed moves toward a new policy
    direction, emerging markets grapple with rising interest rates in the U.S. and
    the global economic growth story has many critical ripple effects across the full
    emerging markets landscape.
