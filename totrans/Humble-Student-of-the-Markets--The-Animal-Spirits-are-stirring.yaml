    groups, such as sectors, countries or regions, or market factors. The charts are
    organized into four quadrants. The typical group rotation pattern occurs in a
    clockwise fashion. Leading groups (top right) deteriorate to weakening groups
    (bottom right), which then rotates to lagging groups (bottom left), which changes
    to improving groups (top left), and finally completes the cycle by improving to
    leading groups (top right) again.'

    defensive sector leadership starting to roll over, and selected high beta and
    cyclically sensitive sectors becoming the emerging market leaders. While defensive
    sectors such as the Consumer Staples, Healthcare, REITs, and Utilities, are in
    the leading quadrant, they are losing relative strength. By contrast, Communication
    Services, led by selected FAANG stocks and high beta names, and Materials appear
    to be poised to become the next market leaders.
