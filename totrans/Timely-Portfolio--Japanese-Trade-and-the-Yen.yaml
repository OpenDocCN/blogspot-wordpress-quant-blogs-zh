- en: I have had the pleasure over the last couple of weeks to help plan the CFA Society
    of Alabama 2012 Dinner featuring Jim Rogers and Barron’s Senior Editor Jack Willoughby. 
    The event was fantastic, and I would like to publicly thank Jim Rogers and Jack
    Willoughby for investing so much time and effort into the State of Alabama.  Both
    are incredible men, and I was delighted to meet them.

    with the point that  leveraged forex trading that has grown popular is not suitable
    for investors.  Jim responded by saying currencies seem unsafe just like all investments
    seem unsafe before a bull run, and that with proper education and management,
    currencies represent outstanding opportunities.  I think both are right.

    I contended that the persistently appreciating Yen was starting to pose an extreme
    competitive disadvantage to the Japanese exporters.  Korean electronic, auto,
    and appliance manufacturers (LG, Samsung, Hyundai, Kia, etc.) have exploded their
    market share in the US due to their huge pricing advantage over their Japanese
    neighbors discussed recently in [Hyundai Motor Europe confident on 2012 goal](http://www.straitstimes.com/Motoring/Story/STIStory_774908.html).

    Koreans in Europe in recent years, said good products backed by a currency which
    is 'extremely competitive' make Hyundai and Kia outperform the market.

    as the Japanese now suffer a significant trade deficit with the world.  The Japanese
    no longer can pursue the harmful Yen policy of the past.  Instead of Yen to US$
    and Euro, they should focus on the Yen versus their competing Asian currencies.

    and if it does, how do you go from US stocks and bonds to a short Yen long emerging
    currency position?
