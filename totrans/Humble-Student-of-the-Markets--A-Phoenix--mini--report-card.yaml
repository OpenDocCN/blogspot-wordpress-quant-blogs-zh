    Phoenix stocks for a punt. If you do, then I would suggest that you manage risk
    with some tight stops in place so that the trade doesn’t totally fall apart on
    you.

    then saw a rally, powered mainly by the “junk” stocks, or Phoenix names, that
    peaked in early May. The S&P 500 further rallied to a new high on June 11, but
    then fell through its moving average on June 22\.

    been?
  prefs: []

    putting on a Phoenix trade, there are no specific selling rules. However, looking
    over the performance of that basket, results have been spectacular, with stocks
    like Fifth Third Bancorp turning in returns north of 300%.

    a trader bought the basket on February 22 and sold on June 22, the day the S&P
    500 fell through its 50-day moving average. The returns would have come to 118%.

    of stabilization, or “green shoots”. Today, the market has now priced in stabilization
    and will only see a significant advance if the economy recovers – a much more
    difficult hurdle.

    that China is growing, driven mainly by rising commodity prices and shipping rates.
    Commodity prices, however, were rallying because of Chinese inventory accumulation,
    not consumption. With stories that Chinese inventory accumulation largely over,
    commodity prices have corrected and so has the

    the trading desks in the near future. This would knock the last underpinnings
    of the current market rally and a decline in the equity indices. It would also
    mean that the USD and bond market would tactically catch a bid. The S&P 500 could
    well test the old lows, either made last November or last March.
