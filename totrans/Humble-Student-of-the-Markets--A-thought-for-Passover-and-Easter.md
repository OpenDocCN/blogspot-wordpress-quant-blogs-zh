# Humble Student of the Markets: A thought for Passover and Easter

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2014/04/a-thought-for-passover-and-easter.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2014/04/a-thought-for-passover-and-easter.html#0001-01-01)

Last night marked the start of Passover and this weekend marks Easter. I want to step back a little from my usual market commentaries and discuss about other things that matter.

I had written about this

[before](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.ca/2013/12/how-to-fend-off-wolves-of-wall-street.html)

. Margitta Krebs, the conductor of the Debut and Junior Orchestras of the Vancouver Youth Symphony Orchestra is retiring after 29 years. The VYSO has decided to honor her contribution to the organization with a bursary in her name to assist young VYSO musicians in need and we are wrapping up this fundraising campaign in early May.

The VYSO has four orchestras which go from age 8 to 22\. I have found that adolescents in these formative years benefit tremendously from hard work, focus and discipline, whether it comes from sports or the kind of musical and orchestral training that comes from the VYSO.

I have had many comments over the years about the quality and uniqueness of my blog post insights. My Passover and Easter thought is to ask my readers to contribute to the Margitta Krebs Bursary in return.

You can find out more about the bursary

and you can contribute directly

. The VYSO is a registered charity and Canadian residents can get a tax receipt for contributions over $20.

On behalf of the young musicians at the VYSO, I thank you for any help that you can give.
