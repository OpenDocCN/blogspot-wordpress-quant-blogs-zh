- en: There have been countless graphics floating around the media outlining the large
    quantity of adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) rate resets that are anticipated in
    the coming months and years.  For some excellent background and analysis on the
    subject of ARM resets, I encourage readers to investigate what [Calculated Risk](http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/search/label/ARM%20Resets)
    has to say on the subject.

- en: One of the silver linings in the global economic slowdown is that as interest
    rates continue to fall, these ARM resets are going to be executed at rates which
    are increasingly favorable to borrowers.  Setting aside the flip side – that lower
    rates will be less favorable to already struggling lenders – the prospect of lower
    ARM rates may help to accelerate the formation of a housing bottom and will certainly
    provide consumers with additional disposable income.

    Cost of Funds Index ([COFI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_Funds_Index))
    data. The COFI is one of the most widely used ARM indices.  As the graphic indicates,
    COFI has fallen from 4.4% in September to 2.7% in July.  It has dropped 1.3% since
    the beginning of the year and is now at one of the most affordable levels of the
    past decade.
