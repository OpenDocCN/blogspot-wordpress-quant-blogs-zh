- en: The broad based US stock market averages were down 4-5% on the day. "Defensive"
    sectors such as utilities, consumer staples and healthcare were down -3.3%, -3.2%
    and -4.0% respectively. While the returns of these sectors outperformed the averages,
    it was cold comfort to investors who lost 3-4% in a single day.

  zh: 美国股市的广泛平均指数当天下跌了4-5%。“防御性”行业如公用事业、消费品和医疗保健分别下跌了-3.3%、-3.2%和-4.0%。尽管这些行业的回报表现优于平均水平，但对于那些一天之内损失了3-4%的投资人来说，这并没有带来太多安慰。

- en: In the words of Dennis Gartman, Thursday was the example of a "margin clerk
    market", where everything was liquidated to meet margin calls or to de-risk portfolios.
    The only green on my screen were bonds and bond ETFs.
