    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    for a trade deal with China, and he was willing to wait until after the 2020 election
    to conclude an agreement. More importantly, Edward Lawrence of Fox Business reported
    that there are no current plans to delay the next round of tariffs scheduled for
    December 15, which is an unanticipated development as the market consensus was
    they would be delayed.
