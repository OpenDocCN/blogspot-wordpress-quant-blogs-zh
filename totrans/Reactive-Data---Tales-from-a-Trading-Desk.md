## Reactive Data

Interesting [read](http://www.javaadvent.com/2013/12/big-data-reactive-way.html) late last year on Java Advent Calendar around Big Data the ‘reactive’ way.  The distributed continous query system diagram in the article reminds me of a certain product that was build I believe on Tibco many years ago.  Its interesting to read that [FastCast](https://code.google.com/p/fast-cast/) is used in development and testing, but something else in production.
