# Falkenblog: Election Bounce

> 来源：[http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2012/11/election-bounce.html#0001-01-01](http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2012/11/election-bounce.html#0001-01-01)

The Financial Times (Lex) had the following trading advice for people willing to make financial bets based on political hunches (I can't link to it because the FT is very cagey on allowing links):

Obama wins: buy Treasuries, (sell gold as hedge), sell stocks
Romney wins: sell bonds, buy dollar and stocks

Obama won, stocks opened down, Gold is up, and Treasuries are up. Not bad advice.
