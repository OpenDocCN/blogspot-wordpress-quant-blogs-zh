    market cycles. The paper showed that returns to price momentum was especially
    positive during bull phases at a stock level. My research showed that this effect
    was extended to the sector and industry level. I identified bull (uptrend), bear
    (downtrend) and neutral market phases using a 50-200 day crossing moving average
    trend following system.

    (ROE) to reflect growth and profitability; the debt coverage ratio to represent
    the likelihood of default; and the accruals-to-average-total-assets measure defined
    by Sloan (1996) to quantify possible accounting red flags.12 To arrive at company-specific
    quality measures, we used the simple arithmetic average of each stock’s percentile
    rank for these three variables.'

    based on this quality measure. On average the strategy produces a small negative
    return. It has some alpha after we control for factor exposure and negative exposure
    to the value factor.

    The second line of Table 2 shows the results of a portfolio where we go long value
    stocks with high quality and short growth stocks with low quality. ***This long–short
    strategy has annual alpha of 11.2% per annum.*** A substantial portion of this
    statistically significant alpha comes from conditioning on quality information.
    ***The annualized alpha, controlling for the Fama–French–Asness–Carhart four factor
    model, is 9.3% per annum***.

    companies with potentially questionable accounting practices. As a result, the
    high-quality value portfolio has a better risk-adjusted return. ***Quality is
    not, in itself, a factor that generates a premium; but value investing conditioned
    on a properly specified concept of quality is a powerful investment strategy.***

    use of both of these disciplines, namely price momentum-trend following and quality-value,
    can be highly complementary strategies in a quantitative equity portfolio.
