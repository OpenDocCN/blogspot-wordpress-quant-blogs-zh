## Stop Breaking Master

Another great InfoQ [presentation](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/linkedin-architecture-practices), “Software Development & Architecture @ LinkedIn”.  10mins into the presentation offer software development process insight – tooling is key.

24mins in, Kafka Multi-Colo

Large projects are difficult!  There is no free lunch.
