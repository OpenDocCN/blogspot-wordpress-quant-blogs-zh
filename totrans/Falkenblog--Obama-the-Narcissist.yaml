- en: All politicians are narcissistic, I suppose. Who else wants to stand up in front
    of people, sense their opinion, and repeat it back to them as it were your own.
    The benefits of having all those eyes on you must be very large for such people.
    When Obama was 35, he wrote a memoir, as if being head of Harvard Law Review is
    something that makes your childhood really interesting to a wide audience. That's
    chutzpah. Now as president, he says "I" a lot.

    your administration. You are their chief spokesman, but don't kid yourself that
    you are micromanaging things. They hated Bush for saying "I'm the decider", so
    it goes both ways.

    a colleague pulled me aside and said, "that was great, but don''t use ''I'' so
    much, it''s we." My initial reaction was: "player hater!"'

    he was exactly right. In any large organization where you are selling something
    connected to a brand, it's not about just you, you are part of a team, and need
    them more than they need you. Humility is a very useful virtue. Of course, you
    don't want the humility of slaves, or timidity, and anything great takes a little
    chutzpah.

    with not using the "I" word when talking about national policy.
