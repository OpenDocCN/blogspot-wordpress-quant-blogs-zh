- en: has a theory that Republicans are master manipulators of emotions by their clever
    framing of issues. He sometimes says we are able to evaluate ideas on their own,
    he emphasizes the fact that people unconsciously respond to word associations,
    and form their beliefs based on these clever marketing strategies (it's a bit
    like how Samuelson used to say he was in favor of a modest Federal deficit but
    this was always mentioned when criticizing tax reductions or military spending,
    and never to suggest a Democrat should not spend more on social programs).   His
    big idea is to change words like 'taxes' to 'membership fees', and 'activist judges'
    to 'freedom judges', because then people will see things with his progressive
    lens.

- en: 'that the word  ''President'' was originally used to designate the US head precisely
    because it was meek: President was like ''presider''. Congress fought the Senate
    on what to call the head of the new US government, as the Senate wanted something
    less humble, something with more grandeur, but agreed to use the title ''President''
    temporarily, hoping that it would be changed later to something like Chief Magistrate.
    This highlights the nature of an temporary government policy.'

    world's foremost superpower with 5000 nuclear warheads and 11 aircraft carriers.
    There are now 147 nations that use President for the title of the chief of state,
    mainly because they aspire to the US President's power. Reality changes words
    much more than words change reality.
