    Today I thought I should try the direct route and show a graph of the difference
    between the cash/spot VIX and the [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures)
    five months out.

- en: Keep in mind that the Barclays [VIX ETNs](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20ETN),
    which are scheduled to begin trading tomorrow, target constant weighted average
    futures maturities of one month ([VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX))
    and five months ([VXY](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXY)). The
    methodology used to achieve the constant maturity involves the blending of different
    proportions of various futures maturities each day. The chart below is slightly
    different in that it utilizes VIX futures with five months to maturity, but only
    rolls the contract out once per month. Nevertheless, it provides a very good approximation
    of the difference between the cash/spot VIX and the VIX futures with five months
    to maturity. Apart from confirming the large difference between current volatility
    expectations and expectations 5 month out, the peaks and particularly the valleys
    in the differential between the VIX and VIX five month futures show a high degree
    of correlation to the peaks and valleys in the SPX during the same period.

    with respect to the [VIX:VXV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%3AVXV)
    ratio. For the record, the VIX:VXV ratio sits at 0.976 as I type this, slightly
    bearish, but consistent with the tight range this ratio has been in over the course
    of the past month.
