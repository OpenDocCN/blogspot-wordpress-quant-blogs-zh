    reader vonjd very helpfully referred me to this paper [The Trend is Not Your Friend!
    Why Empirical Timing Success is Determined by the Underlying’s Price Characteristics
    and Market Efficiency is Irrelevant](http://www.frankfurt-school.de/clicnetclm/fileDownload.do?goid=000000311260AB4)
    by Peter Scholz and Ursula Walther.  The authors conclude

    asset price characteristics of the underlying price process have a crucial impact
    on timing results. This allows us to forecast the timing success depending on
    the market's parameters. An OLS

    the drift has the

    of the relevance of the most important price process parameters. As a result,
    the traditional explanations for timing success can be abandoned: we find that
    it is very likely for the SMA trading rule to generate excess returns over its
    benchmark if the underlying price path exhibits negative drifts, high serial autocorrelation,
    low volatilities of returns, and highly clustered volatilities. Drift and autocorrelation
    of the underlying asset seem to have the largest impact, though.”'

    so difficult to beat over the last decade?”  I have made a lot of progress in
    replicating their research in R, but for now, let’s have a messy look at their

    from timing in the 35 selected leading equity indices**with a little graphical
    help from R.  The colors in the chart indicate the sum of all outperformance by
    the multiple moving averages.  Red, such as China and Russia, demonstrates drastic
    underperformance of the moving average strategies versus buy and hold.  If excess
    return was symmetrical, we would expect bright green similar to the bright red,
    but instead we only see dull gray in the bottom left indicating slight outperformance.'

    the Russell 2000 fits in terms of statistical properties and see if the this fits
