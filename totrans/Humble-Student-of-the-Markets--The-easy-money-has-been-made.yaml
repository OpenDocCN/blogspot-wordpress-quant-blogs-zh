- en: '**Mid-week market update:** I know that this is a trite expression, but the
    easy money has been made. The rally off the October bottom has been astounding.
    My trading model was fortunate enough to spot the exact day of the bottom when
    insiders started buying an oversold market. The rally enjoyed further tailwinds
    in the form of a rare Zweig Breadth Thrust buy signal. The trading model took
    a brief hiatus in November and re-entered on the long side. It took profits when
    the S&P 500 violated its 10 dma.'

    also violated its 10 dma. While my inner investor remains equity bullish, my inner
    trader is far more cautious.
