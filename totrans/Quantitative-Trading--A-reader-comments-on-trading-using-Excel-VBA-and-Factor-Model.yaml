- en: One of the key merits in adopting an automatic trading system approach that
    has helped me is to avoid the temptation for manual interference and thereby improving
    profitability by maintaining consistency. I have found the challenge of developing
    a successful system very rewarding from a personal perspective as I recognise
    that there are many that have tried and failed. However one problem I have encountered
    is my ongoing desire to regularly modify and improve the system which I have found
    can become counter productive as there is a real danger that system development
    becomes an end in itself! I just can't seem to stop tinkering as soon as I come
    up with a new idea or feature!

- en: One advantage of using Excel VBA that I have found is that it is inherently
    flexible as it facilitates the processing of data which can be important especially
    when using fundamental data as part of the system. In this respect I recognise
    that every trader is trying to build in an edge that will make the system more
    profitable. I have noticed that many traders seem to only focus on price by trying
    to seek an edge by looking at special indicators or combination of indicators
    etc. Combining price data analysis with a Factor Model approach is a challenge
    which is ideally suited Excel VBA as it can be easily used to process both fundamental
    and macroeconomic data into a form that can be integrated with price data analysis.

- en: I recognise from your book that Matlab is more powerful than Excel VBA and may
    be just as flexible in integrating fundamental and macroeconomic data but I just
    wanted to draw your attention to benefits I have found using Excel VBA which may
    suit those who like myself are more comfortable in using Excel VBA and are reluctant
    to change. Other features that can be exploited that I have found helpful when
    back testing are automatically producing Price Charts that incorporate Entry and
    Exit points which provides visual reassurance that the system is working as intended
    as well as generating automatic Word reports recording key output for future reference.
