    incompetent or dishonest in the handling of people's funds. They had used the

    the Great Depression. This is just wrong. It's just extremely naive to think bad
    things are caused primarily by bad intentions, because invariably bad ideas, to

    Slate, the size of the government multiplier, the irrelevance of down payments
