- en: '[Systematic Investor Blog](http://systematicinvestor.wordpress.com/) (be sure
    to check out the site) offers extremely good examples of how to use R in finance. 
    Since I firmly believe more examples are always better, I wanted to provide an
    additional very simple example of how to use his [Systematic Investor Toolbox
    (SIT)](https://github.com/systematicinvestor/SIT) for systems development.  This
    will provide a building block for a series of posts similar to my [A Quantstrat
    to Build On Part 6](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2011/07/quantstrat-to-build-on-part-6.html). 
    We’ll use our good old count up/down (CUD) indicator on the S&P 500 Index and
    compare it to [Mebane Faber’s](http://www.mebanefaber.com) 10 month moving average.'

    Any loyal readers will already have known that CUD is not so great at making money.
