    progress toward the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent
    inflation***. In addition, an earlier tightening would increase the likelihood
    that the Committee might be forced by adverse economic outcomes to return the
    federal funds rate to its effective lower bound. ***Some participants*** noted
    the communications challenges associated with the prospect of commencing policy
    tightening at a time when inflation could be running well below 2 percent, and
    ***a few expressed concern*** that in some circumstances the public could come
    to question the credibility of the Committee's 2 percent goal. Indeed, one participant
    recommended that, in light of the outlook for inflation, the Committee consider
    ways to use its tools to provide more, not less, accommodation.

    of inflation moving toward the Committee's 2 percent objective after the transitory
    effects of lower energy prices and other factors dissipate. ***Some participants***
    noted that their confidence in inflation returning to 2 percent would also be
    bolstered by stable or rising levels of core PCE inflation, or of alternative
    series, such as trimmed mean or median measures of inflation. ***A number of participants***
    emphasized that they would need to see either an increase in market-based measures
    of inflation compensation or evidence that continued low readings on these measures
    did not constitute grounds for concern. ***Several participant***s indicated that
    signs of improvements in labor compensation would be an important signal, while
    a few others deemphasized the value of labor compensation data for judging incipient
    inflation pressures in light of the loose short-run empirical connection between

    when it becomes appropriate to do so, that policy normalization is likely to begin
    relatively soon while remaining clear that the Committee's actions would depend
    on incoming data. ***Many participants*** regarded dropping the "patient" language
    in the statement, whenever that might occur, as risking a shift in market expectations
    for the beginning of policy firming toward an unduly narrow range of dates. As
    a result, ***some expressed*** the concern that financial markets might overreact,
    resulting in undesirably tight financial conditions. Participants discussed some
    possible communications by which they might further underscore the data dependency
    of their decision regarding when to tighten the stance of monetary policy. ***A
    number of participants*** noted that while forward guidance had been a very useful
    tool under the extraordinary conditions of recent years, as the start of normalization
    approaches, there would be limits to the specificity that the Committee could
    provide about its timing. Looking ahead, ***some participants*** highlighted the
    potential benefits of streamlining the Committee's postmeeting statement once
    normalization has begun. More broadly, it was suggested that the Committee should
    communicate clearly that policy decisions will be data dependent, and that unanticipated
    economic developments could therefore warrant a path of the federal funds rate
    different from that currently expected by investors or policymakers.

    phrase "many participants", "some participants" and "a number of participants"
    can give us a better understanding of how the consensus at the Fed is developing.
    Indeed, the language of "many participants" is defining market expectations of
    Federal Reserve monetary policy.
