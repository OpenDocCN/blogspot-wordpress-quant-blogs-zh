- en: One of the more interesting – and important – subplots to keep an eye on during
    the current market difficulties is that of the bond insurers.  The two most prominent
    of these bond insurers, [MBIA (MBI)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=mbi)
    and [Ambac (ABK)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=abk), are in the news today
    with reports that the New York Insurance Superintendent is trying to arrange a
    [capital infusion](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&sid=akJnQGtVt6uU&refer=us)
    from the likes of [Goldman Sachs (GS)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=gs),
    [Merrill Lynch (MER)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=mer), [JPMorgan (JPM)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=jpm),
    [Citigroup (C)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=c), and [Wachovia (WB)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=wb).  Presumably,
    the Fed is doing some arm twisting and offering some financial incentives behind
    the scenes, as a failure to resolve the problems with the bond insurers would
    likely trigger systemic havoc and involve a long and expensive list of dominoes
    in the process.

    as saying that while a rapid resolution is essential, ironing out the details
    of a bailout may take awhile.  “It is important to resolve issues related to the
    bond insurers as soon as possible,” Dinallo noted, while cautioning “these are
    complicated issues involving a number of parties and any effective plan will take
    some time to finalize.”

    of its impact on the broader markets, there are some interesting plays on bond
    issuers themselves.  As reported in [24/7 Wall Street](http://www.247wallst.com/),
    Goldman Sachs laid out some [potential valuations](http://www.247wallst.com/2008/01/goldman-sachs-v.html)
    under three different scenarios, ranging from the bond insurers’ being unable
    to raise enough capital to mollify the rating agencies to a situation where the
    capital raised enables the bond insurers to continue to operate as they had in
    a pre-crisis mode.  Looking just at MBI, the valuation spread ranges from $6 to
    $48.

    above shows.  For the record, all February puts now carry an implied volatility
    of more than 200.  While I am not going to recommend a specific trade here, there
    are some fascinating options spreads and [ratio spreads](http://www.optionsxpress.com/educate/strategies/ratiospreads.aspx)
    to look at for those who believe that the Goldman scenarios and numbers are in
    the ballpark.
