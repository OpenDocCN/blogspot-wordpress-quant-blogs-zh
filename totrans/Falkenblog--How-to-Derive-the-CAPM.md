# Falkenblog: How to Derive the CAPM

> 来源：[http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2009/07/how-to-derive-capm.html#0001-01-01](http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2009/07/how-to-derive-capm.html#0001-01-01)

The following 3 minute video goes over the mathematical proof of the CAPM, taken from my

[lecture on Asset Pricing Theory](http://www.defprob.com/video/chap2/index.html)

(where you can also download the Powerpoints I'm going over, and see a much larger screen size). It is so simple you can see why 4 people independently figured it out about the same time (Mossin, Sharpe, Lintner, Treynor). Given the insights of Markowitz (the

[efficient frontier](http://www.moneychimp.com/articles/risk/efficient_frontier.htm)

) and Tobin (

[two-fund separation theorem](http://www.advfn.com/money-words_term_9681_Two_fund_separation_theorem.html)

), it is rather trivial. You can see more videos
