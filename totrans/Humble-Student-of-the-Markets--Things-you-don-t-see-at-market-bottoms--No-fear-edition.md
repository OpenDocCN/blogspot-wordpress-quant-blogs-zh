# Humble Student of the Markets: Things you don't see at market bottoms: No fear edition

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2017/08/things-you-dont-see-at-market-bottoms.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2017/08/things-you-dont-see-at-market-bottoms.html#0001-01-01)

It is said that while bottoms are events, but tops are processes. Translated, markets bottom out when panic sets in, and therefore they can be more easily identifiable. By contrast, market tops form when a series of conditions come together, but not necessarily all at the same time.

 and

[Nearing the terminal phase of this equity bull](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2017/07/02/nearing-the-terminal-phase-of-this-equity-bull/)

). Nevertheless, psychology is getting a little frothy, which represent the pre-condition for a major top. This is just another post in a series of "things you don't see at market bottoms". Past editions of this series include:

Numerous readings indicate that any semblance of investor fear has gone out the window. An update of the

There are plenty of other examples of fearlessness. The full post can be found at our new site
