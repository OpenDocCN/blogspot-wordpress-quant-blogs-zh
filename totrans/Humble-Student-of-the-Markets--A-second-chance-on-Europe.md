# Humble Student of the Markets: A second chance on Europe

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2016/08/a-second-chance-on-europe.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2016/08/a-second-chance-on-europe.html#0001-01-01)

About three weeks ago, I wrote about opportunities in European equities (see

[Worried about US equities? Here's an alternative!](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/08/01/worried-about-us-equities-heres-an-alternative/)

). I pointed out that stock prices in Europe were far cheaper than US, the fears about European integrity and financial system were overblown, and the market seemed to be ignoring signs of a growth recovery.

Since then, the FTSE 100 has moved to new recovery highs since the Brexit vote.

The Euro STOXX 50 has rallied through a downtrend resistance level and it's has retreated to test support.

American investors can see a similar pattern on the USD denominated ETF (FEZ).

If you missed the first opportunity to buy into Europe, this may be your second chance.
