    Money.”  Generally, “Dumb Money” is used to describe the retail investor, but
    based on [Ned Davis Research](http://www.ndr.com), all stock price gains over
    the last 50 years came when there were inflows to equity mutual funds, so this
    would indicate “Dumb Money” might actually be “Smart Money.”

    a view opposite of yours.  Jealousy and bitterness often seems to be the source
    of this “Dumb Money” classification.  John Hussman seemed to fall in this category
    with this [weekly commentary "Profiting from the Tooth Fairy"](http://www.hussmanfunds.com/wmc/wmc090803.htm),
    which with hindsight seems clearly wrong.  However, his definition of “Dumb Money”
    in this same post probably fits very well with mine

    and Japanese Yen, but I might just be bitter or jealous.  By the end of 2011,
    we’ll know the truth.
