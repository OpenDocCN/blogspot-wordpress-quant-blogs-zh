- en: Even though my resume is not in the "active" state on Monster and Dice, I still
    get a ton of calls from headhunters. Since coming out of my New Jersey territory,
    and working in New York, I now pay attention to what Wall Street dev managers,
    architects, and developers are making. After all, when we try to recruit candidates
    for Finetix, we need to be a little more than competitve with the current batch
    of companies.

    is all of the annual February job movement taking place, and new hires want to
    re-stock their technical teams .... but this week has been ridiculous in the number
    of calls and emails that I have been getting for Wall Street firms looking for
    solid technical talent. The same thing must be happening over in the City of London.

    is $150,000\. This must mean that the salary for a City of London position is
    around £100,000\. (Can any London-based developer confirm this?)

    for average developers at my current client around around 10%. Lehman's bonus
    are much, much higher, but you have to work every Saturday. UBS is around 40%.
