- en: In the good old days credit did not apply to U S Treasuries, but let’s just
    assume that given the current situation that there is a 1.4% chance of a loss
    of 50% due to credit (equivalent to the current CDS price on 10y US Treasuries
    of 0.70%). The inflation component should not include this credit risk compensation,
    so for US Treasuries with no credit component, this number must be included in
    the real component. When US 10y TIPS yield 0% but even worse -0.25% last week,
    that means investors find -1% real real returns a yummy recipe.
