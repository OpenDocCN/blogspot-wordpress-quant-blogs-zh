    action in the wake of market angst over Europe and the American economy. On Wednesday,
    the ECB will announce its interest rate decision and Mario Draghi will hold the
    customary press conference afterwards. On Thursday, Ben Bernanke will be testifying
    before Congress.

    action by national governments on the fiscal front,” on “the structural front,
    and on the governance front,” he said.

    in the eurozone, but don't expect too much more. If Draghi were to reverse course
    from last week and announce some extraordinary measure like another round of LTRO,
    it would not only erode the ECB's credibility, but could paradoxically have a
    negative effect on the markets as it asks, "What looming disaster does the ECB
    know about that we aren't aware of?"

    Europe, and the evolving slowdown across the rest of the world all point toward
    additional action by the Federal Reserve. Assuming this continues, it is an issue
    of timing and tools. My baseline is steady policy at the June meeting (depending,
    of course, on the usual financial turmoil disclaimer), with a possibility of an
    extension of Operation Twist. The latter option is something of a tough sell for
    me; it is cheap, but will prove to be ineffective. If the Fed needs to move, they
    need to reverse course back into quantitative easing. ***They need time to build
    internal support for such a move, which argues for action later in the summer
    or early fall, much as we have seen in the past two years.*** I just don''t think
    they have enough to shift policy at this juncture.'

    of weakness - and he was far more market savvy than Bernanke. Therefore the Greenspan
    Fed tended to be more proactive and tended to get ahead of events. The Great Moderation
    was the result of the Greenspan Put - and those policies worked well, until they
    went overboard with the stimulus (and we are still paying the price for those
    policies).
