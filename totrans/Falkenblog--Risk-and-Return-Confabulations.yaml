    on an elephant, and while he moves the elephant somewhat, the elephant has a will
    of its own that is more powerful. A solution to this problem for the elephant
    rider, is that when the elephant goes somewhere you don''t want to go, you just
    convince yourself you wanted to go there all along. This is called confabulating
    a rational.'

    risk generates higher return. Of course, risk must be specified correctly, but
    whatever it is, it generates high returns. So, how to explain the fact that diversified
    firms, those with higher profitability, lower volatility of profitability, and
    lower idiosyncratic return volatility, have higher-than-average returns? How is
    this consistent with risk and return theory?'

    (aka agency) problems. There is a lot of cross subsidization, lots of allocation
    of common costs, lots of finger pointing. Thus, the return premium is from when
    these firms basically get taken over, and become focused again. Then they don''t
    cross subsidize value-destroying projects.'

    and so given the logic of pure mathematics (E[firm value]=exp((mu+s^2/2-r)*t)),
    the more expected volatility, the greater the expected value, the higher the price,
    and lower return.'

    face using the presentation protocols of the field. They suggest a massive amount
    of market inefficiency, but by noting this is 'rational learning' hope nobody
    notices that people are not anticipating what they are going to learn. At least
    behavioralists like Lakonishok and Thaler say 'people overextrapolate'; here,
    they are trying to sell an irrationality story in a convoluted way while maintaining
    the veneer of rationality.

    Discount Factors. Now risk is just out of the picture, and we have people learning
    about the future stumbling in the dark--but you don't want to upset the financial
    theorist's applecart too much, so it is implicitly assured that risk models still
    work, of course. The spooky SDF will be revealed when the messiah arrives, I guess
    (of course, I think risk-return theory is wrong--
