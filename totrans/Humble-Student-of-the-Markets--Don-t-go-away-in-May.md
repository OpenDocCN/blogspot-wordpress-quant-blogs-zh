# Humble Student of the Markets: Don't go away in May

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2016/05/dont-go-away-in-may.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2016/05/dont-go-away-in-may.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models**

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on research outlined in our post

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The

**Trend Model**

is an asset allocation model which applies trend following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or contraction (bearish)?"

My inner trader uses the

**trading component**

of the Trend Model seeks to answer the question, "Is the trend getting better (bullish) or worse (bearish)?" The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. Past trading of this model has shown turnover rates of about 200% per month.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Buy equities*
*   Trend Model signal: Risk-on*
*   Trading model: Bullish*

*

*The performance chart and model readings have been delayed by a week out of respect to our paying subscribers.* **Update schedule**

: I generally update model readings on my

 on weekends and tweet any changes during the week at @humblestudent. Subscribers will also receive email notices of any changes in my trading portfolio.

**Strong momentum = Bullish**

Call it what you want: momentum, broad based breadth, price trend. Despite the short-term consolidation shown by the stock market, the signs of positive momentum make it difficult to be intermediate term bearish.

I can see it in the trading signals of my Trend Model, which turned bullish soon after the February bottom. The prolonged length of the signal is indications of momentum, trend and powerful breadth thrust.
