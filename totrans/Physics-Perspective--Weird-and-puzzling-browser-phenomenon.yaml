    When I click on a hypertext link on a web page --

    Tab." That way I keep the original page open while also opening the new resource.
    Do this on the link above and the new tab will display the excellent page of Simolean
    Sense, a weekly collection of generally great articles from around the web related
    to human psychology and behavior, finance, biology, mathematics and other such

- en: Now the mysterious phenomenon -- Simolean Sense is the ONLY web site I have
    ever visited where right clicking on links doesn't work for me in a reliable way.
    On that site, when I right click on a link, typically nothing happens. At first.
    I have to right click repeatedly, 2, 3,4,5, 8 times, until finally the box opens
    to show the "Open Link in New Tab" option. It's a completely random phenomenon.
    (I just noticed that left clicking gives odd behavior too.) My clicking just doesn't
    work in a reliable way on Simolean Sense, though it does everywhere else. Why
    is that?
