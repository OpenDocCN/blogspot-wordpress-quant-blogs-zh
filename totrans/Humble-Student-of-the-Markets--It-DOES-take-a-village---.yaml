- en: Back when Mack started as a bond trader at Morgan Stanley, in 1972, things were
    a little different. “There were only 350 people,” he says. “***They had $6 million
    in capital. Any time we priced a deal, every partner at the firm came to the meeting***.”
    is first brush with disaster came during the 1987 stock-market crash.

    because the partners' money was on the line. Do you think that today's Morgan
    Stanley behaves in the same way when the senior directors are playing with Other
    Peoples' Money?

    rewards are asymmetric. Today, if they win, bankers make out like bandits, but
    if they lose, someone else takes the hit. If a partnership investment bank loses,
    the partners lose their houses, their cars, their kids education, etc. That kind
    of double-edged incentive system makes people far more sensitive about risk control.

- en: When Chesley Sullenberger landed Flight 1549 in the Hudson, he was hailed as
    a hero, but bringing the plane down and getting the passengers off safely was
    a team effort. Co-pilot Jeffery Skiles somehow had completed restart attempts
    on both engines and was also able to run through most of the procedures to ditch
    the airplane — “something [the crash investigators] found difficult to replicate
    in simulation.” And the flight attendants (Shelia Dail, Donna Dent, and Doreen
    Welsh) ensured that 150 people were able to get out of the two of four exits that
    were viable, within three minutes.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As anyone who has spent time around investment stars knows, the kind of culture
    that is created to support them usually doesn’t lend itself very well to the investment
    equivalent of landing in the Hudson. Instead, the environment can be much like
    that which Gawande has seen in operating rooms, where a head surgeon rules the
    day and is rarely challenged. Few are willing to speak up, leading to “a kind
    of a silent disengagement, the consequence of specialized technicians sticking
    narrowly to their domains. ‘That’s not my problem’ is possibly the worst thing
    people can think,” but it happens all the time (even in the investment world where
    people tend to be smart and opinionated).

    witnessed a "star" investment banker who was allowed to run wild blow up a major
    investment bank, much to the detriment of his partners.

- en: The star system isn’t universal in the business, but it is dominant. And often
    one of the stars is also given the title of chief investment officer at some point
    along the way, a further acknowledgment of their track record — and a position
    for which most are wholly unprepared. Oh, the part of it where they are supposed
    to opine about the market? That they can do and do well. But the real work, of
    creating an organization that builds on an array of talent and a confluence of
    ideas to meet the needs of clients? Not so much.

    In investment banking, that also means creating the right incentive structures,
    not only to make money for the bankers, but to put the right risk controls in
    place so that society doesn't bear the cost of failures.
