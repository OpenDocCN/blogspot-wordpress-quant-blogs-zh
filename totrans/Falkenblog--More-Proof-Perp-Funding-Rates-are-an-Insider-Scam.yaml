    there is no delivery dictating equivalence. The perp premium could widen further,

    without the resolution we have in standard futures markets. There is too much
    risk to motivate unlimited capital into this opportunity. Further, the funding
    rate is not necessarily equal to  *Pperp[0] - Pspot[0]*. For example, in an 8-hour
    funding period where the prior 7-hour average perp premium was negative, the funding
    payment will probably be negative even if the current perp premium is positive.
    No one trading on funding rates would touch the perp until the next funding rate
    window, leaving the perp market unethered. Alternatively, the perp premium could
    widen further, necessitating more margin or an early closure at a loss.

    to long-term investors. Such investors look over weeks, if not months, so they
    are not concerned by the minuscule edge on which market makers and short-term
    arbs are focused. For day traders, the uncertainties around potential 0.1% funding
    returns make the funding rate irrelevant, which is why they tolerate 50%+ funding
    rates (assuming a perp-spot arb, that’s 4 transactions, which would cost at least
    20 basis point total, implying an unactionable range that implies funding rates
    with a 80% annualized range).

    opportunity cost on UST. No one on the web provides tools to incorporate these
    adjustments, though clearly the LPs are doing the correct adjustments. When I
    search ‘BitMEX perp funding rate covariance,’ half of the items presented are
    blog posts by myself over the past five years, implying I am a significant percentage
    of everyone in the world aware of this issue who can talk about it, a set that
    effectively rounds to zero. While BitMEX provides examples of how covariance affects
    the total returns given various hypothetical BTC-ETH returns, they do not offer
    simple tools to calculate this using current data.

    above shows the detailed convexity adjustment needed when comparing Eurodollar
    futures with a Eurodollar swap. Before this relationship was understood, several
    large investment banks made actual arbitrage profits going long the futures and
    short the swaps. Around 1995, however, many prominent academic articles highlighted
    the arbitrage and noted the precise convexity adjustment needed. Eurodollar futures
    and swap traders all account for this subtle convexity adjustment, which is why
    such tools are ubiquitous.

    and just trade it like they would any other asset based on recent price movements.
    If the perp premium reflected bullishness, it would be quite a coincidence that
    bullishness correlated well with the recent ETH-BTC covariance. Those making markets,
    however, know what they are doing and are setting the perp premium to get their
    targeted funding rate.

    persists because their LPs can profit from gaming this funding rate, as its typical
    users are generally trading noobs (who else would want 50+ leverage on an asset
    with a 60 vol?). Perp protocols will never dominate spot until they transition
    away from these sorts of cheap tricks, as institutions are rightfully wary of
    having significant positions on platforms that play silly games.
