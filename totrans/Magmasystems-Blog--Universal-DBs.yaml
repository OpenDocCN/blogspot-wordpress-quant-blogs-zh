    seems to be one consistent message --- The holy grail that all of the financial

    over huge amounts of data. Finetix currently is working in the OLAP space int
    he commodities area of a major financial firm. This firm has asked Finetix to
    invent a cloning machine so we duplicate our 3 OLAP stars and sprinkle them throughout
    the firm. Maybe I should start attending Andrew Brust's presentations at the various
    .NET user groups.
