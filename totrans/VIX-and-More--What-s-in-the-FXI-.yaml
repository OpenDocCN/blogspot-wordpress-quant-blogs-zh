    (ticker [FXI](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=fxi)) is regularly trading 5
    million or so shares per day, it would be fairly easy for a trader to make a living
    trading just this one basket of <place st="on"><country-region st="on">China</country-region></place>
    stocks.  It has [volatility](http://www.ivolatility.com/options.j?ticker=FXI:NYSE&R=1&period=12&chart=2&vct=),
    it has [options](http://quote.morningstar.com/Option/Options.aspx?sLevel=A&ticker=fxi)
    (check out the new Morningstar options data if you haven’t already), and it will
    [soon have a 2x inverse ETF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/10/update-on-people-trading-bidu-also.html)
    (ticker FXP) if you want to play the other side at twice the speed.

    easy reference I offer links to a Yahoo Finance version of that list in an [intra-day
    format](http://finance.yahoo.com/q/cq?d=v1&s=chl%2c+ptr%2c+lfc%2c+ceo%2c+snp%2c%2c+cha%2c+chu%2c+ach%2c+cn%2c+hnp)
    and also in the more detailed [summary format](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=CHL,PTR,LFC,CEO,SNP,CHA,CHU,ACH,CN,HNP&d=s).  At
    the moment, all ten companies on this list are trading down 2-6% for the day,
    while the FXI is down 3.4% after hitting a new high of 219.56 during yesterday’s
    trading session.

    is more convincing evidence that the FXI has put in at least a short-term top.  At
    that point, the volume in the FXP may also provide some interesting clues about
    investor sentiment, specifically the breadth and depth of concern about a bubble
    in the Chinese stock market.  For now at least, there is no reason to believe
    that the <country-region st="on"><place st="on">China</place></country-region>
    trend is going to end soon and the best place continues to be on the long side.
