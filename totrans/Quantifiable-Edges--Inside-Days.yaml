    a while. For those unfamiliar an inside day is simply a day that makes a lower
    high and a higher low than the day before. Over the last decade, when the market
    has been trading below the 200ma, inside days have suggested negative short-term
    implications. Below is a table that demonstrates this.

    increase or decrease this edge. But generally there has been a poor track record
    following inside days. It's been fairly steady, too. This can be seen in the equity
    curve below which uses a 2-day holding period.
