    in person, I am very much looking forward to his talk on “Position Sizing and
    Relation to Risk Management.”  Another featured speaker is Benjamin Bowler, Global
    Head of Equity Derivatives Research, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, whose talk
    is titled, “Post-Central Bank Volatility: More Risk But More Alpha.”  Two of my
    favorite perennial speakers are back again this year:  Maneesh Deshpande, Managing
    Director and Global Head of Equity Derivatives Strategy, Barclays is a panelist

    gathering of volatility practitioners, academics and other manner of VIXophiles
    that I am aware of.  In short, if you speak VIX and are looking to find your lost
    tribe, here they are.  This is why I like to informally refer to the RMC as The
    VIX Summit.
