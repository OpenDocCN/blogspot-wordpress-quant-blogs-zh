    and illiberal to rise to the top. As they find their plans untenable, they will
    be forced to apply force to achieve their aims, so those willing to apply such
    force will tend to be most successful in such systems. A problem with modern politics
    is that as only dissembling narcissists can succeed, politicians at all levels
    become such pathetic losers.

    results from the new Somali immigrants who cluster at certain schools. This has
    made certain elementary schools have lower scores than others, and so their solution
    is to spread the Somalis around. That this only superficially rids one metric
    of inequality while not actually raising Somali scores (except through the theory
    of osmosis), and making my little guys take a longer bus ride across town, makes
    me almost want to run for the school board. Today''s election in my little town

    reading their position statements, they all speak in platitudes similar to those
    spoken by senators and presidents, making statements that no one disagrees with.

    that first and foremost they all want to be liked by everyone, and think that
    being trite and vague are the best ways to that end. These aspiring politicians
    are afraid of saying anything that people might actually disagree with, but then
    if everyone agrees with you, you really aren't saying anything interesting. As
