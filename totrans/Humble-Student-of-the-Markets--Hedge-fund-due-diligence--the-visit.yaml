    investment manager, hedge fund or otherwise, I would ask the portfolio managers,
    traders and other staff questions about the investment and operating philosophy
    of the firm to see if there are any significant differences between the operational
    view and the marketing spin. In times of market stress, these differences in philosophy
    and approach can make the difference between successful control and catastrophic
    failure.

    In proper OPDD we would have discussed numerous other items prior to the on-site
    visit such as extensive phone conversations, verifications, background checks,
    reviewing the DDQ and much more. The on-site visit is not an overwhelming task
    if it is done correctly. Depending on the depth of your experience and the complexity
    of the fund, the visit should take a minimal amount of time. (usually only a day
    of two but can take up to a week if necessary). I will try to keep this very high
    level and extremely general in discussion, there is certainly more to the “On-Site
    Visit” than what is listed below.

- en: The on-site visit is a critical component of the due diligence process. Make
    sure the manager is aware that you are coming for a scheduled visit. You want
    to make sure that all key personnel are informed of your visit and are there to
    answer any questions you might have.

    the offering documents, understand the managers fund structure and investment
    philosophy as well as answer almost any question you have about the manager via
    prior phone conversations. Now you starting the on site visit. This is how you
    will verify that the manager is operating according to what the offering documentation
    and DDQ have revealed.

- en: The on-site visit is much broader than the few areas mentioned above. Obviously
    the operational due diligence criteria will differ from manager to manager and
    is quite extensive. After all relevant information is collected it should be turned
    over to the investment committee for review. OPDD does have a black and white
    science behind it. But there is also the art of connecting all of the procedures
    and practices that lead to understanding the workflows that actually occur. Anyone
    new grad student can go down a check list, but to truly understand all of the
    operational fund complexities can only be done through experience.
