- en: As a full-time investor and part-time blogger, I have a weakness for web sites
    that focus on ETFs, volatility and charts – three of the subjects I feature prominently
    in this space. For this reason, I was excited when [ETFreplay.com](http://etfreplay.com/)
    appeared on the scene earlier this year specializing in ETFs, offering some unique
    and compelling graphics, and demonstrating an interest in volatility.

- en: The site is still evolving, but is already a fun an informative destination,
    particularly for investors who are interested in ETFs. Some of the functionality
    currently offered includes screening, back testing, correlations, charting, etc.
    There is also a [blog](http://etfreplay.com/blog/) which provides graphics and
    commentary on a number of issues related to ETFs. The content is excellent, but
    the graphics are what inspired the tagline, “Visualization tools for investors.”
    I have included one example graphic below in which I decided to compare the performance
    and volatility of four popular energy ETFs ([XLE](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLE),
    [OIH](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/OIH), [XOP](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XOP)
    and [USO](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/USO)) relative to the S&P
    500 ETF (SPY) over the course of the past year. I'll let the chart speak for itself.

- en: In my opinion, there only a handful of top tier ETF web sites out there. While
    it may still be a little too early to add ETFreplay.com to that list, based on
    the speed at which the site is improving, I suspect it will not be long before
    that gap is closed.
