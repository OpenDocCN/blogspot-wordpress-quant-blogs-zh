- en: The Trend Model is an asset allocation model which applies trend following principles
    based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. In essence, it seeks
    to answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish)
    or contraction (bearish)?"

- en: The market action last week saw some good news and some bad news. The bad news
    came in the form of weakness in the Greater China equity markets, but that was
    offset by the goods news of upside breakouts in Europe and a positive relative
    strength showing by US small caps. When I net it all out, I remain constructive
    that equity bulls will see another visit from Santa Claus this year.
