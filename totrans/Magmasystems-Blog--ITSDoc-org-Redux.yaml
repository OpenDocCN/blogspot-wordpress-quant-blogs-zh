- en: ITSdoc.org is still very much alive. It recently passed its millionth page view
    and it gets hits from all over the world every day. It strives to be helpful to
    coders (hopefully open source) of Investment and Trading Systems by assembling
    into one place a great set of documentation.

- en: Personally, I have been drawn away from driving ITSdoc forward for about a year
    now volunteering actively at FIX on a standard that will cover the next generation
    Algorithmic order types. I’ve got to say, volunteering at FIX and mixing it up
    with the fantastic people in the various technical Work Groups and Global Technical
    Committee has been wonderful! They have a bunch of brilliant people who all selflessly
    volunteer tons of time to the betterment of the industry through a FREE standard.
    Plus, it’s been a real great eye opener on exactly how the largest industry players
    cross connect. Mind you these same people go back to their firms and compete vigorously.

- en: Last summer our Algorithmic Order Standard Work Group conduced in-depth interviews
    with five MAJOR order management system (OMS) vendors as well as considerable
    secondary research into the adoption trends in algorithmic orders types. Much
    of that learning was incorporated into the proposed standard, which is in the
    final stages of official adoption at FIX. In just a few weeks its expected to
    enter the pilot testing phase. See

- en: FIX is a bit more complex than the average open source coder of Investment and
    Trading Systems might like to struggle with, starting with the printed protocol
    specification alone. There are many tags and enumerated values, the various messages
    can be complex and there is a substantial learning curve. There is one outstanding
    open source FIX engine out there QuickFix, available in C++ and Java, but due
    to the complexity of the FIX standard it’s quite complex to implement. In the
    future ITSdoc hopes to help lower the bar to adopting FIX, and help get around
    using all those nasty, expensive, dedicated IP circuits.

- en: Dealing with emerging ISO standards this past year has also been challenging.
    If you are designing an open source Investment and Trading System your internal
    data models need to comply with various standards (including various versions
    of standards, service packs, extensions, customizations, variations in usage,
    etc). Needless to say all these different “flavors” and “dialects” of the various
    standards often don’t mesh well with each other. However, the situation is slowly
    improving. XML is now everywhere and XSLT can ease (but not eliminate) the pain
    of making translations.

- en: The ITSdoc UML project is on hold for the moment. I went to write up a meta
    Use-Case on processing text news during investment decision-making and got mired
    down with various sub topics such as bias in news coverage. My background includes
    some work in cognitive psychology and I was perhaps too far down in a “deep dive”
    on the subject. When I caught myself with a new book on psycholinguistics I thought
    to myself, you’re in pretty deep, perhaps its time for some decompression. Still
    the material is fascinating and to a degree exceedingly relevant to investment
    decision-making. Getting a handle on it however has proven very time consuming.
    I have a ton of great material but getting it all into publishable format has
    been constrained by the “hours in the day” limit.

- en: So, plenty going on behind the scenes at ITSdoc. Coders of open source Investment
    and Trading Systems are very much encouraged to register at the site. We shoot
    for quality over quantity. Plus, we can often hook people up with other “birds
    of a feather” who are interested in similar things.
