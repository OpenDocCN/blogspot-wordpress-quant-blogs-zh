- en: The task of managing portfolios isn't as easy as it seems. Not only do you have
    to think about issue selection, you also need skills like portfolio construction
    and trading. Over the years, I have seen very smart and experienced sell-side
    analysts who have had great difficulty making the transition to the buy-side and
    portfolio management.

- en: But when the market was hot, and deals would close within an hour, I would work
    differently. When the deal would come, I would put in for bonds, so that I would
    get some allocation. I would ask for the high end of what I would normally ask
    for, knowing that I would get scaled back considerably. Then I would send the
    details to my credit analyst, telling them that if they did not like the company,
    I would sell the bonds.

  zh: 但当市场火爆时，交易会在一个小时内完成，我会采取不同的做法。当交易来临时，我会申请债券，这样我就能得到一些分配。我会要求比我通常要求的量多，知道我会被大幅削减。然后我会把交易的详细情况发送给我的信用分析师，告诉他们如果他们不喜欢这家公司，我会卖出债券。
- en: Eventually, most of my analysts during the times when the market was hot would
    come to me and say, “How can you put in for bonds without an opinion from us?”
    First I would reassure them, and tell them that I valued their opinions, and that
    I would not hold onto a bond permanently unless they liked it. I would sell all
    bonds they did not like, but when the technicals favored it, within a few months.

  zh: 最终，在我市场火爆的时候，我的大多数分析师都会来找我，说：“你怎么可以不听取我们的意见就买入债券呢？”首先我会让他们安心，并告诉他们我重视他们的意见，除非他们喜欢，否则我不会永久持有债券。我会卖出所有他们不喜欢的债券，但当技术面有利时，会在几个月内卖出。

- en: But I started selling away, and began to learn the art of price discovery. When
    you want to sell a bond, you first have to look at what investment banks ran the
    books of the deal. There is an unwritten rule that if they play that large role
    in origination, they have to make a market in the bonds thereafter.
