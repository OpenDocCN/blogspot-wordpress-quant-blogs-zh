- en: The task of managing portfolios isn't as easy as it seems. Not only do you have
    to think about issue selection, you also need skills like portfolio construction
    and trading. Over the years, I have seen very smart and experienced sell-side
    analysts who have had great difficulty making the transition to the buy-side and
    portfolio management.

    differently. When the deal would come, I would put in for bonds, so that I would
    get some allocation. I would ask for the high end of what I would normally ask
    for, knowing that I would get scaled back considerably. Then I would send the
    details to my credit analyst, telling them that if they did not like the company,
    I would sell the bonds.

    come to me and say, “How can you put in for bonds without an opinion from us?”
    First I would reassure them, and tell them that I valued their opinions, and that
    I would not hold onto a bond permanently unless they liked it. I would sell all
    bonds they did not like, but when the technicals favored it, within a few months.

    you want to sell a bond, you first have to look at what investment banks ran the
    books of the deal. There is an unwritten rule that if they play that large role
    in origination, they have to make a market in the bonds thereafter.
