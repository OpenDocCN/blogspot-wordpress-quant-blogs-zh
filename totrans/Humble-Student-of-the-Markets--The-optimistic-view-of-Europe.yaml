    prepared for that. Those politicians who know what is needed keep quiet, fearing
    opposition from the voters. But the pressure of this crisis will create a momentum
    whose scope and impact we cannot yet imagine. At the end of the day, the United

    century America. The ratification of the United States constitution in 1788 was
    preceded by 12 years of a loose confederation, which sometimes worked but usually
    didn''t. Europe is in a similar situation today. States are like people, it is
    difficult to sustain a stable half-marriage; either you go for it or you forget
    it.'

    integration without political integration. Rogoff believes that the European elite within
