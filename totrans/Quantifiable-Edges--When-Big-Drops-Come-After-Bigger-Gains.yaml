    is often a tendency for it to bounce the next day.  This tendency varies greatly
    though, and depends on a large number of factors.  One factor to consider is how
    the market moved the day before.  Let’s look at a couple of equity curves that
    will demonstrate my point.  This first one shows results since 2003 of buying
    all 1% drops at the close and selling at the close the next day.

    to show a consistent upside tendency.  Now let’s look at all times the big drop
    failed to close the SPX below the close of 2 days ago.

    big drop did not wipe out yesterday’s gains, then it may have further to go.
