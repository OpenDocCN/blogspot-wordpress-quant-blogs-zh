- en: This was just too amusing to pass on. Having a cooling problem with a 10G fpga
    board which required some hardcore **engineering skillz** to solve. Essentially
    the board has no fan and there is no case resulting in a rather poor airflow and
    toasty chip. To make it worse there was nothing to rest the fan on thus the below
    highly engineered solution was taken to the business for approval.

    tie to secure the alen key to the heatsink, via the heatsinks own design.
