# StreamInsight: Clustering and High Availability | Tales from a Trading Desk

## StreamInsight: Clustering and High Availability

Microsoft provides no insight in its CTP2 documentation regards cluster support. Coral8 on the other hand provides [clustering](http://www.coral8.com/system/files/assets/pdf/5.6.0/Coral8TechnologyOverview.pdf) support. One has to assume Microsoft will offer some sort of cluster support, the question is therefore will cluster support make it to Version 1?

**Sidebar**: I wonder if Microsoft plan to merge the StreamInsight Debugger into Visual Studio 201x?
