    from investment to output, we confirm that business investment has deviated little
    from what could be expected given the weakness in economic activity (see chart
    2). In other words, firms have reacted to weak sales—both current and prospective—by
    reducing capital spending. Indeed, when businesses are asked about the main challenges
    facing them, they typically report lack of customer demand as the dominant factor.

    between business investment in KBC and macroeconomic growth and productivity change.
    It is estimated that between 1995 and 2007 27% of labour productivity growth in
    the United States was explained by investments in KBC. Across Europe, investment
    in KBC accounts for 20 to 25% of average labour productivity growth. And research
    indicates that Canada’s GDP and labour productivity growth would have been 0.2
    percentage points higher between 1976 and 2000 if previously excluded KBC were
    included in the national accounts as investments.

    treated as investment, measured labour productivity growth increases in all countries.
    In national accounts, treating KBC as investment, rather than intermediate expenditure,
    generally increases the contribution to overall growth coming from capital deepening
    (i.e.

    Nor does it explain the complementarities between those determinants. Econometric
    methods are needed to tackle this challenge. Considering human capital and R+D
    – two forms of KBC – research has established their positive and significant impacts
    on macro-level productivity and growth. For instance, raising average educational
    attainment by one year has been estimated to increase aggregate productivity by
    at least 5%. R+D not only enlarges the technological frontier, it also enhances
    firms’ technological absorptive capacity. Micro-econometric studies often find
    private rates of return to R+D in the range of 20-30%. This is generally higher
    than the returns to physical capital, which is consistent with the higher risk
    associated with KBC. And the spill-over effects of R+D, while hard to measure
    precisely, are usually found to be large.

    is becoming more important. The FRED graph below depicts R+D and software as a
    % GDP (blue line) and Private Nonresidential Fixed Investment, or CapEx, as a
    % of GDP (red line). Notwithstanding the different scales, the chart shows that
    while CapEx tanked in the wake of the last recession and has not recovered, investment
    in intellectual capital has been flat during the same period.
