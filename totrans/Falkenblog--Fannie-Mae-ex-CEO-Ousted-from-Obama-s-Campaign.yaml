- en: about this guy, he seems like a prime example of why Fannie Mae should be shut
    down. This guy spent his life as a pure politician. He is a veteran Democrat.
    When Mondale ran for president in 1984, Johnson was the chairman of his campaign.
    Maxine Isaacs, who later became his wife, was the campaign's press secretary.
    Johnson joined Fannie Mae in 1990 and became its chairman a year later.

    particularities of its assets, because its assets have risks that are very peculiar,
    one is always looking at cohorts, and roll rates, etc. My old boss, Kevin Blakely,

    as a Democratic operative? Nothing, except access to politicians. It's as if they
    made Newt Gingrich head of NASA. He was clearly valuable merely in maintaining
    the Fannie Mae's plumb position maintaining its special access to government finance
    rates. That can be the only reason. And so Fannie Mae became, for decades, a place
    to reward high-level Washington politicians with million a year jobs. It's a scam.
    He got rich perpetuating a government-sponsored monopoly that provides high-level
    patronage jobs.
