    the best conference is for the VIX and volatility aficionado, I should note that
    my favorite VIX conference, the [29^(th) Annual CBOE Risk Management Conference
    (RMC)](http://www.cboermc.com/http:/www.cboermc.com/), begins this Sunday and
    runs through Tuesday. The conference is being held in Carlsbad, California (about
    30 miles north of the San Diego airport) at the [Park Hyatt Aviara Resort](http://parkaviara.hyatt.com/hyatt/hotels-parkaviara/).

    new policies, strategies and tactics to manage risk exposure and enhance yields.
    The conference provides an ideal setting for institutional users and prospective
    users of exchange-traded derivatives to network with their peers, exchange ideas
    and learn the latest information about new products and risk management strategies.*'

    [2011 event](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2011/03/vix-summit-aka-cboe-risk-management.html)
    and have the RMC as my only ‘must go’ conference for each of the coming years.
    On second thought, the CBOE did sponsor the [CBOE RMC – Europe](http://www.cboermceurope.com/)
    in County Wicklow, Ireland last September and if the European version of this
    conference comes around again this year, I might have to rethink my priorities.

    to say hello, just look me up or drop me note.
