    12-month old to the doctor because he has a cold, the best thing the doctor can
    do is nothing. Maybe a placebo. So too for the economy.'

- en: They don’t even have a really coherent critique; as Brad DeLong points out,
    if you believe that a surge in private spending would raise employment — and even
    the critics agree on that — it’s very hard to explain why a surge of public spending
    wouldn’t have the same effect.

    spending, is like the difference between pushing an old lady down and pushing
    her out of the way of a runaway train. private investment is the result of millions
    of individuals making decisions based on their wealth and profit expectation;
    the other is simply someone spending other people's money to help other people
    get jobs.

    with something good invariably causes feedback effects, most bad, because complex
    systems tend to be optimized, and so the 'total derivative' in futzing with some
    input is usually negative (though the first partial often highly positive). This
    is why we do not suggest one take serotonin supplements, even though higher levels
    of serotonin are correlated with success and high status. Testosterone is known
    to have many positive qualities for men, but the best ways to generate a higher
    level of testosterone is to exercise regularly, including weight training, avoid
    insulin spikes, get your body fat low, and get good sleep. A bad way would be
    to inject it into you bloodstream. This is because the latter invites your body
    to decrease the amount it makes, and the net effect is usually negative.

    jobs, but these are taking away money spent on something else, so the net is often
    negative. Further, unlike natural demand, the incentives of the workers are not
    necessarily so good for 'natural' jobs we would like them to eventually get.
