    trading floor.

- en: I sit on a very large Equities trading floor that overlooks the Hudson River
    in lower Manhattan. Our particular area of the floor has the Derivatives Analytics
    group (my group) and Algorithmic Trading. The next row has the High Frequency
    Trading guys and some of the guys who control the high-speed market data systems.

- en: Needless to say, the past few weks have been crazy. There is such an energy
    on the floor that, sometimes, everyone is our row just stops working in order
    to absorb the electricity. 15 minutes before the opening, things start humming.
    At the bell, it's chaos for about a half hour. People screaming out orders, groups
    of traders applauding and whooping when a trade turns out favorable. After 10,
    things really slow down until about 3PM.

- en: Our group is composed of Quants. We trade our own positions, and we write software
    which enable us and other groups to trade. Almost all of our software is in C#/.NET
    2.0, heavy use of generics and anonymous delegates.

- en: The group is ethnically diverse. 4 Americans, 1 Brit, 3 Far-East Asians, and
    a couple of Russians for good measure (what's a good Quant group without the Russians!).
    3 of the guys have PHDs, the rest have MS's. Actually, the head of the group does
    not have a Master's degree ... however, he got 3 Bachelor's degrees in 3 years
    at one of the top business schools in the world. Most of the group is fairly young.
    If you are in your early 30's, you are ancient. That makes me a pile of ash on
    the floor.

- en: The group has its own framework. The framework is typical Russian mad scientist
    code. With this kind of code, it's never "A calls B". It's "A starts 5 threads,
    waits for completion signals, creates other objects via some dependency injection,
    does a few somersaults, and then calls B." But the framework is highly performant.

    framework that my team developed for Equities. So, I am eating my own dogfood.
    I have not found any bugs in my stuff, but I have had to extend it a bit so that
    it cooperates with some of the stuff that Derivs Analytics have previously written
    (like Live Greek Servers).

    I work from home. If I have to do really major thinking and design work, I cannot
    do it at work! It is hard to work at work. Luckily, a lot of Wall Street is starting
    to go to a model of allowing people to work from home part time. The three hours
    I save on commuting to NYC is time that I put into work. Now that my son is off
    at college, I don't have to worry about his heavy-metal bands coming into the
    house at 3:00 every afternoon to thrash around the basement.
