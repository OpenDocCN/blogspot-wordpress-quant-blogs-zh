    been rallying since mid-November and at this rate will be encountering technical
    resistance - much like the pattern of US equities like the SPX.

- en: The employment report offered me no reason to change my baseline opinion that
    the US economy continues to grow at a slow, steady pace regardless of the quarterly
    fluctuations we see in GDP growth. Indeed, there seems to be little news in November's
    numbers. This is good news in the sense that fears that the economy is slipping
    toward stall speed in the final quarter of the year is not yet translating into
    weaker job growth. The same is true for fears of the fiscal cliff, debt cliff,
    austerity bomb, etc. The bad news is that ***we are not seeing the 200k+ numbers
    that the Fed is leaning towards as evidence of stronger and sustainable improvement
    in the labor market. That means the Fed will continue to add to its stock of assets,
    converting most if not all of Operation Twist into an outright purchase program
    next week***.

    week (to start at the conclusion of Operation Twist). It seems the FOMC will move
    to thresholds, but probably not until next year. On projections, I expect GDP
    to be revised down for 2013, and the unemployment rate to be revised lower for
    2013 and 2014\.
