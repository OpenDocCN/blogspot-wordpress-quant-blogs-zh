    operate. Opening a hedge fund is problematic. The founder has a secret. Either
    the secret is that the founder has no new ideas. Or, the founder’s secret is a
    new idea. If the founder has no new idea, that cannot be revealed. If the founder
    has an original idea, he also can’t share it with investors because they might
    steal it. “Competitors might figure out the trade for themselves and buy the same
    insurance, driving up the cost. That made Paulson reluctant to provide details
    of his trade. It was a stance that made it more difficult to raise money” (Zuckerman,
    p. 127‐8). Indeed, Paulson’s friend Jeffrey Greene does steal the idea. Michael
    Burry has the same problem: “If I describe it enough it sounds compelling, and
    people think they can do it for themselves. . . If I don’t describe it enough,
    it sounds scary and binary and I can’t raise the capital” (Lewis, p. 58).'

    convince others, a common reply was, 'why isn't everyone else doing it?' Now the
    problem is everyone is doing it (low vol investing).

    you can't start a hedge fund unless you or a very close associate, has at least
    a million or two to invest.
