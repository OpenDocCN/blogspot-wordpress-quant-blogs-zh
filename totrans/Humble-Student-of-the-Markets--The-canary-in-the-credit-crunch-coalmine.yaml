    slows, banks react by tightening their lending criteria, which dries up the availability
    of credit, and eventually causes a credit crunch. There are a number of ways that
    investor can monitor the evolution of lending standards.

    data shows that readings remain benign for both corporate and individual borrowers.
    One disadvantage of the survey is the results only come out quarterly, which is
    not very timely and amounts to looking in the rear view mirror.

    and the St. Louis Fed`s Financial Stress Index. Current conditions show that Stress
    levels are starting to rise, though the absolute stress levels remain low. Both
    of these data series are released monthly, which is more timely than the lending
    officer surveys.
