    has a tendency to pull back during the day.  Below is a study that represents

- en: It appears over the last few years this setup has failed to deliver consistent
    downside movement.  I looked at this a number of ways this morning and most of
    the equity curves looked like this.  So be careful getting overcondfident trying
    to short this gap.
