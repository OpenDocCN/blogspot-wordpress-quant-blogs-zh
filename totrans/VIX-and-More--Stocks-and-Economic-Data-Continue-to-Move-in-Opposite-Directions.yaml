    I discussed the rapidly deteriorating economic data relative to expectations and
    noted the sudden strong divergence between economic data and the stock market

    decline, but there also exists the possibility that stock prices are beginning
    to reflect the possibility an economic turnaround at the end of the year or in
    early 2013.”*'

    data and the stock market is no less murky. After being tightly correlated for
    2 ½ years, stocks and economic data have been moving in almost the exact opposite
    direction since the beginning of June, no doubt partly due to the intervention
    of central banks across the globe.

    just as the trend in economic data relative to expectations began diverging from
    stocks in June, the two began converging again when economic data began to show
    signs of improvement about a month ago.

    promising [nonfarm payrolls report](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/nonfarm%20payrolls)
    as an excuse to buy some stocks this morning. For now at least, stocks and the
    economy continue to move in opposite directions – whether that means up or down
    for stocks.
