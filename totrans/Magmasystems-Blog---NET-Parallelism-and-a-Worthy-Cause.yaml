- en: is available from Microsoft on how Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) greatly
    reduced the time (and cost) to analyze the results from a colonoscopy. For men
    over 50, a colonoscopy is practically mandatory, and the process is somewhat disruptive
    and uncomfortable. The use of parallelism has reduced the analysis time by many
    orders of magnitude, and has made the concept of "virtual colonoscopies" even
    more real.

    this was impossible. I wonder if there would have been even more magnitude of
    improvements if the code was ported.

    pricing and risk (and stress tests) might benefit from a rearchitecture to the
    .NET/C#/TPL stack.
