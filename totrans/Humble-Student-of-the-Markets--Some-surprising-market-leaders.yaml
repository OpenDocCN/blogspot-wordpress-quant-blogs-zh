    are a few surprising groups showing either sustained market leadership or emerging
    leadership that are potential outperformers.

- en: The first and most obvious are the homebuilders. The chart below of the homebuilder
    ETF (XHB) against the market (SPY) shows XHB to be in a well-defined relative
    uptrend. With the housing market bottoming and the Fed's QE3 buying MBS paper
    to support the housing market, this is an industry that has a definite tailwind
    at its back.

    sector. The chart below showing the relative performance of this sector against
    the market is showing the signs of a potential relative return bottom.

- en: The trouble with the Tech sector is that the heavy influence of Apple on the
    performance on the sector. AAPL continues to struggle as the stock's rally was
    rejected at the 200 day moving average. The negative action of this single stock
    is weighing down the performance of the sector.

- en: The relative performance of the equal weighted NASDAQ 100 (QQEW) as a proxy
    for the Technology sector tells the story of a relative turnaround in a much clearer
    fashion. In November, QQEW rallied through a relative downtrend that began in
    February and it has staged a robust relative performance rally.

- en: Another surprising industry that is turning around is Agribusiness. The relative
    return pattern of the Agribusiness ETF (MOO) is similar to the one seen in QQEW.
    MOO rallied out of a relative downtrend in September and has been in a relative
    uptrend ever since.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A word of warning is warranted here. MOO is relatively thinly traded and doesn't
    have a lot of components. As well, the agricultural commodity complex is not showing
    a similar level of leadership relative to the broadly diversified commodity indices
    - which makes this trend slightly suspect.

    have to be on Mars in the last few years to be unaware of the rolling series of
    crisis in the eurozone. Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Italy - the list goes
    on and on. While the world waits for Eurogeddon, chartists are now watching the
    European stock averages such as the Euro STOXX 50, i.e. eurozone stocks, rallying
    strongly to test a major resistance level.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On a relative basis, the Euro STOXX 50 (FEZ) rallied through a relative downtrend against
    the MSCI All-Country World Index (ACWI) in August and it has now staged an upside
    relative breakout. Count European stocks as another leadership group.
