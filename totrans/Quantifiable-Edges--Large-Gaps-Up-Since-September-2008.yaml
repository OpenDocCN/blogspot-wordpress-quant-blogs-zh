- en: Last year I did some studies on the blog that looked at how the market reacted
    to different morning gap sizes. I defined a “large gap” as anything greater than
    0.75%. Since early fall that hasn’t even been an average size gap. As I’m writing
    this in the morning the futures are up almost 3%. Below are the results of a test
    that looked to buy just after a large gap up and then sell at the end of the day.
    They are run for varying gap sizes going back to September 2008.

- en: Large gaps higher in downtrends have historically shown a propensity to squeeze
    shorts and continue higher over the course of the trading day. This propensity
    has continued to exist over the last 6 months or so while the market has been
    especially “gappy”.
