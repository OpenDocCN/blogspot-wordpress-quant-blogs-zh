    it a night, I thought I would share a couple of thoughts about today’s action
    and the market’s prospects for tomorrow and beyond.

    if there were one or more unintentional large trades, this does not nullify the
    concerns about sovereign debt contagion, breaking of technical support, recent
    excessive bullish sentiment, etc.

    sharply, with only [brief interruptions](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/05/s-500-index-correction-at-post-march-09.html),
    for the past 14 months.

    40 today. While there is no magic number that signals a VIX top, the volatility
    index is up more than 110% in the last 18 trading days. Apart from September-October
    2008, this has never happened in the 17 years since the VIX was launched.

    any big moves at the open tomorrow. If I trade at all in the first half hour,
    I expect I will be fading any big moves.

    a trading range, with the late April highs as a top and today’s lows as a bottom.

    is an appropriate strategy at times. Patience and discipline almost always trump
    trying to make something happen.

    the [fundamental causes](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/07/forces-acting-on-vix.html)
    and [likely duration](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/10/conceptual-framework-for-volatility.html)

    to new positions, and adhering to stringent stop loss and position management
    guidelines.
