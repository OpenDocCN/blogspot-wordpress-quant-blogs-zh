## Data Science into Production

“What is hardcore data science—in practice?” is a great [article](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/what-is-hardcore-data-science-in-practice) on moving data science into production.  Figure 5 (image from article courtesy of Mikio Braun) nicely captures the two worlds,  capturing the data science exploratory world where “done” is a model that can be used in production.
