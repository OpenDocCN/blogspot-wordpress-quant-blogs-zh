    to Expectations](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2012/06/worst-post-2009-week-in-economic-data.html)
    (no I have never written headlines for a living…) I detailed the rapidly deteriorating
    picture of economic data relative to consensus expectations.

    topped and began their swoon.”*'

    month stretch. The chart below details the trend in economic data relative to
    expectations going back to the beginning of 2010\. Note that the last two months
    not only include the sharpest short-term decline in economic data in three years,
    but also reflect a stock market that seems decoupled from economic data for the
    first time since stocks began to rally in 2009.  Prevailing opinion is that the
    decoupling from economic reality is merely a case of postponing the inevitable
    decline in stocks, but there also exists the possibility that stock prices are
    beginning to reflect an economic turnaround at the end of the year or in early
    2013.
