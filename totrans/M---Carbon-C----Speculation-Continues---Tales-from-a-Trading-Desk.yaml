- en: Anyone who’s read Joe Duffy’s 2014 blog [postings](http://joeduffyblog.com/2013/12/27/csharp-for-systems-programming/)
    knows that there is something brewing in the Microsoft compiler and language department. 
    What language the new language will be based on (C#, or maybe C++) isn’t clear,
    or the name of said language.  Channel 9 [forum’s](https://channel9.msdn.com/Forums/Coffeehouse/new-info-around-Midori-team?page=3)
    offers some thoughts based on LinkedIn profiles etc.  Will anything be said about
    the new language at [Build](http://www.buildwindows.com/) 2015 conference?  Or
    will we have to continue waiting for some while longer for Joe to post another
    titbit of information?
