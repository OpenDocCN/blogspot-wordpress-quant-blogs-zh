Hi David,

It appears that managing the equity curve efficiency is inversely proportional to how well the underlying strategy is working. In this example, daily follow through works well in the 1982-2000 bull market and the method lags. As the market transitions to mean reverting and the original strategy falls apart then the method shines.

Perhaps applying this method to strategies with t-stat < -1.6 (i.e. declining equity curves) would be optimum?
