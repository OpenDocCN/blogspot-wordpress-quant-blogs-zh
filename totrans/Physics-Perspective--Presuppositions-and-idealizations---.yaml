- en: an interesting passage from Hans Albert on the weird use of theoretical abstraction
    in economics; "weird" as in very unusual and rather questionable from the perspective
    of the rest of science. As Albert writes,

- en: Clearly, it is possible to interpret the ‘presuppositions’ of a theoretical
    system … not as hypotheses, but simply as limitations to the area of application
    of the system in question. Since a relationship to reality is usually ensured
    by the language used in economic statements, in this case the impression is generated
    that a content-laden statement about reality is being made, although the system
    is fully immunized and thus without content. In my view that is often a source
    of self-deception in pure economic thought …

    the area of application of the constructed model so that it is impossible to refute
    it with counter examples. This of course is usually done without a complete knowledge
    of the fatal consequences of such methodological strategies for the usefulness
    of the theoretical conception in question, but with the view that this is a characteristic
    of especially highly developed economic procedures: the thinking in models, which,
    however, among those theoreticians who cultivate neoclassical thought, in essence
    amounts to a new form of Platonism.'

    derive some conclusions, and then feel as if they've made a real and lasting contribution
    to understanding the world. They've produced an "if... then" statement; established
    a logical connection. It's often a secondary consideration whether this "if...then"
    has anything at all to teach us about OUR world. Economics, in this sense, is
    just a branch of mathematics. Pure mathematics, not applied mathematics.

    in relation to the rest of science. Their conclusion is much the same -- that
    many if not most economists (theorists, at least) see their task as producing
    "theoretical cases," which cannot possibly be refuted, as they are merely logical
    connections between antecedent suppositions and logical implications.

    Ricardo Caballero [wrote about](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/jep.24.4.85)
    what he called the “pretense-of-knowledge syndrome” in academia. Economists, he
    argued, had become “so mesmerized” with the internal logic of their theories that
    much of the discipline -- even that part concerned directly with policy making
    -- had spiraled off into fantasy. Even when they studied issues close to the crisis,
    such as bubbles, panics and fire sales, they relegated them to the periphery of
    macroeconomics, which at its core valued mathematical elegance over usefulness.

    Gilboa and a group of economists who recently tried to understand why their profession
    operates so differently from most sciences. Academic economists, they say, use
    the term "explanation" in a way that other scientists never would. Instead of
    developing realistic and testable theories like those in biology or physics, they
    often aim only to develop "theoretical cases" -- imaginary mathematical worlds
    with their own rules of cause and effect.
