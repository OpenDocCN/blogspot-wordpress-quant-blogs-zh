- en: ', and they asked me to rate my pain on a scale of 1 to 10\. Now, it hurts quite
    a bit, especially when I don''t take massive doses of ibuprofen. I say, it hurts
    so bad I can''t think (explains a lot, I know). The nurse asks, "is that a 10"?
    I think, no, probably an 8\. You see, I can imagine a 10 would be something diabolical,
    like burning the skin off my flesh with a blow torch, poring honey on my wounds,
    and allowing rabid animals to lick and nibble at my charred, sugary, flesh. Or
    scraping the back of my legs with a cheese grater. Or sticking a syringe down
    the back of my fingernails. Or pounding my toes with a hammer, and then methodically
    breaking my bones from one end to another while keeping my internal organs fully
    functioning. But if I say "8", they don''t give me anything for the pain, so I
    lie, and say, "yeah, it''s a 10".'

- en: I remember some guys from an Irish bank came by to talk about risk management,
    and one guy said their little trick was to have scales that went from 1 to 4\.
    That way, people couldn't put in the median number for everything. I remember
    how proud he was of this, and you know, for a middle manager in risk, it wasn't
    a bad idea. It was not a great idea, but it wasn't bad.
