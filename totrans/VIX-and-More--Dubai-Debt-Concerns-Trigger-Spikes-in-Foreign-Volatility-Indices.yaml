- en: With the S&P 500 and NASDAQ futures both down approximately 3% as I type this
    on [concerns](http://bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=az5tuIpE96f8&pos=1)
    about the ability of Dubai World to repay some $59 billion in debt, tomorrow’s
    half day session is likely to be ugly and volatile. In a vacuum, this type of
    event would be concerning, but not likely to cause panic. With the emotional scars
    of the financial crisis still looming large in the memories of investors (i.e.,
    [Availability Bias and Disaster Imprinting](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/11/availability-bias-and-disaster.html)),
    I would not be surprised to see an overreaction in the markets tomorrow.

    the [Dow Jones STOXX 50](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Stoxx_50) index
    of European companies fell 3.36%, yet the [VSTOXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VSTOXX),
    (the corresponding volatility index, which is similar to a pan-European VIX) spiked
    28.16%.

    and investors having an entire weekend to fret about possible contagion or additional
    cockroaches suddenly appearing, I am predicting a wild ride.

    as it shows signs of having topped, but there are frequently multiple spikes to
    contend with in these types of scenarios.
