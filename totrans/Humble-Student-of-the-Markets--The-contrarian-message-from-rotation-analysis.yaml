    prism. I was reviewing the RRG charts of sector, region, and factor, and I found
    that they are all telling a similar story.

- en: ', or RRG charts, are a way of depicting the changes in leadership in different
    groups, such as sectors, countries or regions, or market factors. The charts are
    organized into four quadrants. The typical group rotation pattern occurs in a
    clockwise fashion. Leading groups (top right) deteriorate to weakening groups
    (bottom right), which then rotates to lagging groups (bottom left), which changes
    to improving groups (top left), and finally completes the cycle by improving to
    leading groups (top right) again.'

- en: The latest sector rotation chart shows that financial stocks and cyclical stocks
    (energy, industrials, materials) are the leading groups, but they are weakening.
    By contrast, defensive sectors are starting to improve from the lagging quadrant
    to improving. In particular, the upgrade of interest sensitive utilities from
    lagging to improving quadrant is consistent with the nascent counter-trend rally
    seen in the bond market.
