- en: My father passed away this summer and in the intervening period I set aside
    my media hat. Before I formally return to the media space, I want to use this
    space to talk a little bit about my father.

  zh: 我父亲于今年夏天去世，期间我放下了我的媒体帽子。在我正式回到媒体领域之前，我想利用这个空间谈一谈我的父亲。
- en: My father was an eccentric man and sometimes a complete enigma even to those
    who were closest to him. For instance, while we share the same name, he insists
    that I was named not after him but his uncle Bill, who was a [baseball player](http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=luby--001wil)
    in his earlier years and later became coach, attorney and a judge. My father followed
    his uncle into the legal field, with his own twist, carving out his own niche
    as a modern-day country lawyer and advisor.

  zh: 我父亲是一个古怪的人，有时甚至连最亲近他的人也完全无法理解他的谜。例如，虽然我们有相同的名字，但他坚持说我不是以他命名的，而是他的叔叔比尔，他是早年的一个[棒球运动员](http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=luby--001wil)，后来成为教练、律师和法官。我父亲跟随他的叔叔进入了法律领域，加入了自己的色彩，将自己打造成了现代乡村律师和顾问。
- en: Outside of family and work matters, sailing, quantum physics and jazz were the
    three things my father was most passionate about. While part of the appeal of
    sailing was no doubt the escapist aspect of charting one’s one course – my father’s
    own moveable island – I have often thought that more than 90% of our father-son
    relationship and peer-to-peer relationship was formed while sailing together from
    Long Island Sound to Down East Maine. One particular trip that I often think about
    was a voyage from [New London, Connecticut](http://www.ledgelighthouse.org/images/700_Abandoned_Light.jpg)
    to [Cape Cod Bay](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiFMlUaf0eUTcwFWhNpAkbjWXsdnyIcHqTyR2rXhUJ-oRA8bePcQ5snwLesnDj4Fxovn5I6BhK8iP3z7xvwTl0tLKOKmnK-qDIITLKQzZwOdmqtMcfkHxuNFHHz-Mbq00yjdSrYFhU7QLlo/s1600/beachwalk2.JPG)
    which was slowed dramatically by adverse currents and a lack of wind. Arriving
    very late one night at [Cuttyhunk Island](http://images.marinas.com/med_res_id/117659),
    we determined that the delays had almost entirely depleted our food supplies.
    After rummaging through the storage locker, my father declared that what remained
    were nine Saltine crackers and two bottles of wine. For dinner, he placed one
    bottle of wine on the table in front of me and pushed five of the nine crackers
    my way. I had begun that day as a 14-year-old boy, but when I woke up the next
    morning, I had no doubt that I was now a man. Several years later, we talked extensively
    about buying a [Beneteau](http://www.beneteauusa.com/Sailboats) and sailing it
    back from [Saint-Gilles-Croix-de-Vie, France](http://www.saintgillescroixdevie.fr/var/ptic/storage/images/media/images/vue-aerienne-de-saint-gilles-croix-de-vie/84481-1-fre-FR/Vue-aerienne-de-Saint-Gilles-Croix-de-Vie.jpg),
    but this adventure never came to fruition.

  zh: 在家庭和工作之外，帆船、量子物理学和爵士乐是我父亲最热衷的三件事。虽然帆船的吸引力无疑在于规划自己航道的逃避性质，但我经常想到，我们父子之间和同龄人之间90%以上的关系都是在从长岛海湾到缅因州东部一起航行中形成的。我经常想起的一次旅行是从[康涅狄格州纽伦敦](http://www.ledgelighthouse.org/images/700_Abandoned_Light.jpg)到[卡普角湾](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiFMlUaf0eUTcwFWhNpAkbjWXsdnyIcHqTyR2rXhUJ-oRA8bePcQ5snwLesnDj4Fxovn5I6BhK8iP3z7xvwTl0tLKOKmnK-qDIITLKQzZwOdmqtMcfkHxuNFHHz-Mbq00yjdSrYFhU7QLlo/s1600/beachwalk2.JPG)的航程，由于逆流和缺乏风，速度被大大降低。深夜抵达[卡迪韩克岛](http://images.marinas.com/med_res_id/117659)，我们发现延误几乎完全耗尽了我们的食物供应。在搜索储物柜后，我父亲宣布剩下的是九块盐味薄脆饼干和两瓶酒。晚餐时，他把一瓶酒放在我的桌子上，把九块饼干中的五块推过来。那天早上，我以一个14岁男孩的身份开始，但当我第二天早上醒来时，我毫无疑问地知道我现在是一个男人了。几年后，我们广泛讨论了购买一艘[本尼豪](http://www.beneteauusa.com/Sailboats)并将其从[法国圣吉尔克鲁瓦德维](http://www.saintgillescroixdevie.fr/var/ptic/storage/images/media/images/vue-aerienne-de-saint-gilles-croix-de-vie/84481-1-fre-FR/Vue-aerienne-de-Saint-Gilles-Croix-de-Vie.jpg)带回的计划，但这个冒险从未实现。
- en: Ironically, while [my mother](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/06/for-my-mother.html)
    was a teacher, journalist and quite adept at communicating, my father preferred
    to use language as a puzzle, where he would leave a minimal number of clues and
    see if the recipient of those clues could find his or her way to the finish line.
    Dubbed “The Great Communicator” by some of those who spent extended periods in
    his verbal labyrinth, when he wanted to my father could be an expert writer or
    orator, but when he preferred to get overly creative with language, he typically
    lost most of his audience in a hurry.

  zh: 具有讽刺意味的是，尽管[我的母亲](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/06/for-my-mother.html)是教师、记者，而且很擅长沟通，我父亲却喜欢把语言当作谜题，留下最少的线索，看看接受这些线索的人能否找到到达终点的路。有些人长时间被困在他的口头迷宫里，称他为“伟大的沟通者”，当他想的时候，他可以是一个出色的作家或演说家，但当他更愿意过度创新地使用语言时，他通常很快就会失去大部分观众。
- en: As much as my father provided advice and counsel for countless family and friends,
    very little advice was aimed in my direction. One piece of advice I did hear over
    and over again was, “Keep your options open.” I have always attached a high degree
    of value to having options in life, but I often smile at the thought that a large
    part of what I do professionally is sell options to those who place a higher value
    on them than I do.  On a somewhat related note, when I was a child, my father
    was keen on having me play chess with him. I received no leniency, coaching, hints
    or advice of any kind while losing literally thousands of matches. Eventually,
    I was able to learn enough to win consistently and in the process also learned
    how to figure things out for myself, the value of tenacity and many other life
    lessons. Only after his passing did I find an old yearbook and discover that he
    was the chess champion at his high school. Needless to say, without his hand,
    I would never have developed some of the skills that I enjoy today.

  zh: 尽管我的父亲为无数的家人和朋友提供过建议和忠告，但很少有针对我方向的。我听过无数次的建议是，“保持你的选择开放。”我一直高度重视生活中的选择，但经常会笑着想，我职业上做的很大一部分事情是向那些比我更重视选择的人出售选择权。说到这里，我想起小时候，我父亲热衷于和我下棋。输掉几千场比赛的过程中，我得不到任何宽容、指导、提示或建议。最终，我学会了足够多的东西，可以持续获胜，在这个过程中，我也学会了如何自己解决问题，坚韧的价值以及许多其他生活课程。他去世后，我找到一本旧的年鉴，才发现他是高中时的象棋冠军。毫无疑问，没有他的引导，我今天永远不会拥有我喜欢的某些技能。
