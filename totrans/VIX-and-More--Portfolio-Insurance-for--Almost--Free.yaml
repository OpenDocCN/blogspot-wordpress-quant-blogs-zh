    and a good deal of the craziness was in the [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures)
    market, with impacts felt in the likes of [VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX),
    which jumped 11.6% in less than an hour (the last 40 minutes of the regular session
    and the first 14 minutes of after-hours trading.)

- en: The corresponding spike in the VIX futures prices pushed the front two months
    of the VIX futures [term structure](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/term%20structure)
    into [backwardation](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/backwardation)
    (a downward sloping term structure curve in which front month futures contract
    is priced higher than the second month futures contract) for only the second day
    since November 2011, with the lone exception dating from May 18, 2012, when the
    front two month contracts were in backwardation by a mere 0.05 points.

- en: The chart below shows how the VIX futures term structure changed over a ten-day
    period from December 18 to December 28\. While all eight VIX futures contracts
    that were trading on both dates showed in increase, the magnitude of these increases
    were skewed dramatically toward the front months, where the January VIX futures
    contract jumped 38.4%, the February contract gained 28.4%, the March contract
    rose 21.2%, etc. Also of note, whereas the December 18^(th) term structure was
    upward sloping in an almost perfect linear fashion, by December 28^(th) the term
    structure had twisted so that the January contract is now trading at a higher
    level than the contracts for the February, March, April and May expirations. In
    fact, the market is now pricing in expectations that a VIX of about 22 will persist
    for the next five months.

- en: With the backwardation in the front two months of the VIX futures contracts,
    this also means that investors who are looking to hedge long equity exposure against
    an increase in volatility can now take advantage of what is essentially free portfolio
    insurance. Of course I am using the “free” label loosely, but given that the short-term
    VIX futures (first and second month contracts) are in [contango](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/contango)
    (front months less expensive than more distant months) more than 80% of the time
    and subject to the price decay associated with negative [roll yield](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/roll%20yield)
    while in contango, I feel it is important to underscore that the short-term VIX
    futures roll yield is now positive, meaning that if the VIX January and February
    contracts do not change in price, the positive roll yield should provide a small
    lift to VXX, [UVXY](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/UVXY), [TVIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TVIX)
    and the other short-term [VIX ETPs](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20ETN)
    with a long volatility bias.

- en: Now before anyone gets too excited about the possibility of free portfolio insurance,
    it is important to understand that the reason the VIX futures are in backwardation
    is that market participants anticipate that the VIX will decline going forward,
    making a long volatility hedge of limited value. So while long positions in VXX,
    UVXY, TVIX and their ilk are benefiting from positive roll yield at the moment,
    most investors consider that a decline in the VIX and VIX futures is likely to
    more than compensate for any gains due to roll yield, meaning that these hedges
    will probably be net losers when one accounts for the changes in the VIX futures
    and the roll yield.
