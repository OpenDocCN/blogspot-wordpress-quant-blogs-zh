- en: Most of the discussion trying to determine if the U.S. is Japan 20 years later
    focuses on the economy and the stock market.  However, one of the biggest and
    most persistent correlations between Japan and the U.S. are the Japanese Yen and
    the U.S. 10 Year Treasury Yield.  I think it is essential to really try to explore
    this relationship to help determine “How Japanese are we?”  With the US $ in decline,
    it is hard to imagine the continued persistence of this dynamic. *(Thanks reader
    teramonagi for catching an error.)*
