- en: Anyone who thinks "technocrat" implies a scientific, rational, top-down way
    to manage an economy--as I'm sure DeLong does--is a Keynesian, and probably only
    a Republican for the social agenda. They exist, but they aren't the kind of Republicans
    I like.

    very enlightened, because they prioritized doing less at the federal level. Unfortunately,
    most really smart, educated, people fall prey to such scientism as the assertion
    that there exists a simple positive correlation between total employment and the
    size of the aggregate demand for goods and services; it leads to the belief that
    we can permanently assure full employment by maintaining total money expenditure--from
    any source--at an appropriate level. Thus to them it's obvious that that top-down
    management of a large complex process is better than letting it alone. As Fredrich
    Hayek put it in his

- en: While in the physical sciences it is generally assumed, probably with good reason,
    that any important factor which determines the observed events will itself be
    directly observable and measurable, in the study of such complex phenomena as
    the market, which depend on the actions of many individuals, all the circumstances
    which will determine the outcome of a process, for reasons which I shall explain
    later, will hardly ever be fully known or measurable. And while in the physical
    sciences the investigator will be able to measure what, on the basis of a prima
    facie theory, he thinks important, in the social sciences often that is treated
    as important which happens to be accessible to measurement. This is sometimes
    carried to the point where it is demanded that our theories must be formulated
    in such terms that they refer only to measurable magnitudes.

    census surveys, diversity outreach PowerPoints, environmental impact studies.
    Having people in jobs that are the best fit for them, in the context of what others
    really appreciate and what they enjoy doing, isn't in any aggregate data.
