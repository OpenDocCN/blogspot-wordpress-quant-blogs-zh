    can either take 1 bet, 10 bets, or 100 bets--all uncorrelated. As the chart above
    suggests, one can manage risk by pooling truly uncorrelated bets together. As
    the number of bets increases, the volatility goes to zero and the expected value
    becomes the observation.

- en: 30-50 stocks seems to be a sweet-spot where an investor eliminates portfolio
    idiosyncratic volatility, as additional diversification beyond this point does
    not help reduce volatility in any dramatic way. However, by diversifying beyond
    30-50 stocks, we also prevent our portfolio from concentrating on stocks we feel
    are "undervalued." In other words, we probably want Warren Buffett to hold 30
    or so stocks to ensure he doesn't completely blow up, but we don't want to force
    him to hold more than that, because it is unlikely he has more than 30 good ideas.
    In effect, he would be "diworsifying."
