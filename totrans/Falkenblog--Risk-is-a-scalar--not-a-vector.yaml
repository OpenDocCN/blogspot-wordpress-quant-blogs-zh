- en: A pernicious reaction to failures is to add factors and nuance, not simplify
    and integrate. That is, an additional risk measure, or an additional risk oversight
    group. But risk is a scalar, not a vector. The problem with risk as a vector,
    that is, a set of numbers like {3.14, 2,73, 1.41} is that it's relevance is left
    as an exercise for the reader. Thus, one number can be high, another low. Should
    one look at the 'worst' number? Average all the numbers? Throw out the high and
    low numbers? In general, such a bevy of numbers leads to some being above average,
    others below. Indeed, as the risk vector grows over time, invariably some are
    above average because reviewers love to give everyone some marks that need improving,
    and some that give the reviewed some encouragement.

  zh: 对失败的一个有害反应就是增加因素和细微差别，而不是简化和整合。也就是说，额外的风险测量，或者额外的风险监督小组。但是风险是一个标量，而不是矢量。风险作为矢量的问题在于，也就是，一组数字，如{3.14,
    2.73, 1.41}，它的相关性作为阅读者的练习留给了读者解决。因此，一个数字可以很高，另一个很低。应该看看“最坏”的数字吗？对所有数字取平均值？抛弃高低的数字？总的来说，这样一堆数字导致一些人高于平均水平，另一些人低于平均水平。事实上，风险矢量随着时间的推移而增长，总是有一些高于平均水平的，因为评审者喜欢给每个人一些需要改进的成绩，也喜欢给被评审者一些鼓励。
- en: 'The famous 1987 space shuttle disaster involved, with hindsight, the serious
    error of flying during low temperatures that were known to cause problems with
    the O-rings. Now, this issue was raised as part of the review process, with about
    a hundred other such ''mission critical'' risks. Of course, it was overridden.
    A good risk number should go off rarely, so when it does go off, you respond.
    Otherwise, it''s like the ''check engine'' light on a crappy car: everyone thinks
    the light is broken, not the engine (and they are usually right).'

  zh: 著名的1987年航天飞机灾难，事后看来，涉及一个严重的错误，即在已知会导致O形密封圈问题的低温下飞行。现在，这个问题在审查过程中被提出，还有大约其他一百个“任务关键”风险。当然，这被忽略了。良好的风险数字应该很少出现，所以当它确实出现时，你就要作出回应。否则，这就像一辆破车上的“检查发动机”灯：每个人都认为是灯坏了，而不是发动机（他们通常是对的）。
- en: Take the UBS case. They have Group Internal Audit, Business Group Management,
    GEB Risk Group Subcommittee, Group Head of Market Risk, Group Chief Credit Officer,
    UBS IB Risk & Governance Committee, IB Business Unit Control and IB Risk Control,
    UBS Group Risk Reporting, Audit Committee, IB Business Unit Control. I could be
    missing some. This clusterpuck of groups is a recipe for disaster, because tricky
    issues are generally left for someone else. Lots of groups, and their opinions,
    is isomorphic to having a risk vector, not a risk scalar. For example, the VAR
    for subprime used only a 10-day horizon, and was based on only the past 5 years
    of daily data. Who's idea was that? Who is accountable? I bet somewhere you will
    find someone who made the appropriate criticism, but in the end, they were ignored.
    Basically, if some one person can't see how the risk of a product in its entirety,
    and report this to the CEO, who can understand what is being said, this company
    should not do these things.

  zh: 来看看瑞银的情况。他们有集团内部审计、业务集团管理、GEB风险小组子委员会、市场风险集团负责人、集团首席信贷官、UBS投行风险和治理委员会、投行业务单元控制和投行风险控制、UBS集团风险报告、审计委员会、投行业务单元控制。我可能漏掉了一些。这些组群的混乱是灾难的雏形，因为棘手的问题通常是留给其他人的。很多组群和他们的意见，相当于拥有一个风险矢量，而不是一个风险标量。例如，次级抵押贷款的
    VAR 只使用了一个 10 天的视野范围，而且只是基于过去 5 年的每日数据。这是谁的想法？谁来负责？我敢打赌，你会在某个地方找到提出适当批评的人，但最终他们被忽视了。基本上，如果有一个人无法看到一个产品整体的风险，并向能够理解所说内容的首席执行官报告，那么这家公司不应该做这些事情。

  zh: '[穆迪对次级抵押贷款混乱的回应](http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2008/04/risk-is-scalar-not-vector.html#0001-01-01)。他们建议，也许，对于结构性信用，他们可以在结构性信用等级上补充一些额外的信息，比如，AAA.v2。正如卡特和金巴尔在他们2008年2月的专题评论中所指出的那样，“穆迪是否应该考虑区分结构融资和企业评级？”：'
- en: The additional credit characteristics could be conveyed through symbols that
    would not be physically appended to the rating but instead provided in separate
    data fields, analogous to other existing rating signals such as rating outlooks
    and watchlists. This approach would avoid entanglement with the existing rating
    system – a potential issue for both rating agencies and users of ratings data
    – and would encourage the addition of more information content over time because
    such information would not have to be appended to the rating itself. For example,
    an issue could have a “Aaa rating, with a ratings transition risk indicator of
    v1, with a data quality indicator of q3, and a model complexity indicator of m2."

  zh: 附加的信用特征可以通过符号传达，这些符号不会物理附加到评级上，而是提供在单独的数据字段中，类似于其他现有的评级信号，如评级展望和观察名单。这种方法会避免与现有的评级体系纠缠在一起，这对评级机构和评级数据的使用者都是一个潜在问题，并且会鼓励随着时间的推移增加更多的信息内容，因为这样的信息不必附加到评级本身。例如，一个问题可以有一个“Aaa评级，具有v1评级过渡风险指示器，具有q3数据质量指示器，以及m2模型复杂度指示器”。
- en: 'A single group, with a single number, such as a properly constructed VAR or
    Moody''s rating, is very informative because it is unambiguous. Such a number
    should have lots of documentation that mentions how different risk factors were
    addressed, but at the end of the day, risk, like return, is a single number. I
    know caricatures of Value-at-Risk are pointless, but those errors are rectifiable
    within the framework: fat tails, long holding periods, absence of specific historical
    data. The nice thing about it is that when its wrong, it''s wrong, and people
    and methodologies can be held accountable. But a vector can always be right if
    you just would have looked at the various signals that were bad (in a large vector,
    some always exist). Risk measurement is about creating an unambiguous evaluation,
    so that it can be compared directly to another business line, without all sorts
    of qualifications. Eventually, you have to explain this to 60-something senior
    management, and while they should have some level of knowledge, they shouldn''t
    have to integrate 10 risk group''s findings on risk reports that each contain
    5 numbers and lots of qualitative nuance. That''s how UBS lost $37B.'

  zh: 一个单一的群体，具有一个单一的数字，比如一个合适构建的VAR或穆迪的评级，是非常信息丰富的，因为它是明确的。这样的数字应该有大量的文件说明，提及如何解决不同的风险因素，但归根结底，风险就像回报一样是一个数字。我知道价值风险的讽刺是毫无意义的，但这些错误在框架内是可以纠正的：肥大尾巴，长期持有期，缺乏具体的历史数据。它的好处在于，当它错了，它就错了，人们和方法都能够负责。但是，如果你只是看看那些不好的各种信号（在一个大向量中，总是存在一些），向量总是可以正确的。风险度量是为了创建一个明确的评价，这样它就可以直接与另一个业务线进行比较，而不需各种资格。最终，你必须向60多岁的高级管理层解释这一点，虽然他们应该具有一定程度的知识，但他们无需整合10个风险组的风险报告发现每个报告都包含5个数字和大量的定性细微差别。这就是瑞银损失370亿美元的原因。
