    by much more time. I managed to shave an hour off the duration of my last trip,
    but anything more is going to be I suspect hard to achieve.

    event – Leveraging Technology to Drive Customer Connections @ 1290 Avenue of Americas
    – was a small event (25 people approx) it did at least allow me to show the three
    StreamInsight POC’s I’ve been working on for the last n months. I also finally
    managed to meet Torsten Grabs rather than just speak to him on the many conference
    calls 🙂 Hopefully the audience today came away with some ideas of what StreamInsight
    can be used for in the Capital Markets space.'
