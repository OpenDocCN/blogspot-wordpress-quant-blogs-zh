# HOXO-M - anonymous data analyst group in Japan - : New package "SparkRext" - SparkR extension for closer to dplyr

[Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/)

is one of the hottest products in data science.

Spark 1.4.0 has formally adopted SparkR package which enables to handle Spark DataFrames on R.

SparkR is very useful and powerful.

One of the reasons is that SparkR DataFrames present an API similar to dplyr.

We launced our new package "SparkRext" to redefine the functions of SparkR to

enable NSE(Non stanard Evaluation) inputs

.

As a result, the functions will be able to be used in the same way as dplyr.
