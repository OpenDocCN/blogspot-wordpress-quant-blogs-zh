## 2014 SEF Big Data Machinary

Wall Street & Technology has an interesting [article](http://www.wallstreetandtech.com/trading-technology/sefs-arrive-a-new-market-structure-is-bo/240163262) on SEF’s. offering a 2014 view of more market data coupled with magic machines.  More data can only be good for the Big Data pushes that are occurring in many organisations.  Also in Wall Street & Technology, an article offering a 2014 [view](http://www.wallstreetandtech.com/data-management/big-data-20-myth-vs-reality/240163372) of Big Data 2.0.  The Big Data article cites Open Source as the preferred Big Data route for technology, which should play nicely for the [Spring XD](http://projects.spring.io/spring-xd/) initiative.

I’d be curious if anyone has done anything with Spring XD?  I see there’s a [sample](http://docs.spring.io/spring-xd/docs/1.0.0.M3/reference/html/#_syslog_ingestion_into_hdfs) project leveraging Redis, RabbitMQ and Hadoop.  Unfortunately, I’m also interest in the [application](http://www.firmex.com/blog/7-big-data-techniques-that-create-business-value/) of [fuzzy](http://peds2040.chocchildrens.org/artificial-intelligence-big-data/) logic, [machine learning](http://www.slideshare.net/larsga/introduction-to-big-datamachine-learning), AI with regards to Big Data.  Spring XD looks [interesting](https://blog.codecentric.de/en/2013/09/spring-one-wrap-up-spring-batch-spring-hadoop-and-spring-xd/), but will require some thought and a [PoC](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-hadoop-samples) around leveraging the [streams](http://spring.io/blog/2013/06/12/spring-xd-1-0-milestone-1-released).
