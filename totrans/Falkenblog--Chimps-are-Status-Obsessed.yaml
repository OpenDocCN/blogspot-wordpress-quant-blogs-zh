    in general, and why the perverse demand for low volatility assets is not arbitraged
    away (benchmark risk prevents this).  This explanation is not even acknowledged
    by most (all?) academics for explaining things like the low volatility anomaly.'

    economist''s conception of self-interest would be a major improvement: short-sighted
    selfishness is worse than long-sighted selfishness, but it''s not nearly as destructive
    as envy. Alas, economists have the standard bias of thinking that everyone thinks
    as they do. Further, they have the bias that since it would be nicer to think
    people are not so much envious as rationally self-interested, it has to be true.'

    350 years have we really changed life for your average person. The American Plains
    Indians had no conception of property rights when Columbus got here, and it highlights
    an earlier stage of society, more like our chimp cousins and the instincts they
    bequeathed us. It's nice to think that hunter-gatherer's are more peace-loving,
    and more in tune with the environment, more authentic, etc., when actually they
    are homicidal, dogmatic, and status obsessed; their lack of greed isn't a feature,
    it's a bug.

    aspire, not to be great men, but good men, because great men are often insufficiently
    empathetic. Yet, we shouldn't presume people are more greedy than envious, which
    is easy to do because most articulate chimps hide their envy behind altruism,
    as attacks on the 1% are presumably about wanting less injustice via equity. This
    is true for some, but I suspect it's not true for the vast majority, who simply
    want to knock those on top down closer to their level.
