- en: Another 2% gap today. For those that feel 2% gaps are becoming the norm – they
    are. Below is a chart that shows the 50-day absolute average gap of the SPY. Over
    the last 50 days prior to this morning the average gap had been 1.87% (in either
    direction). This is nearly twice as large as any other time since the SPY began
    trading in 1993\. First, the chart. Then a few remarks.

    bottoms in the market.

    speaks to the unique and extreme nature of the current environment. This can’t
    be stressed enough.

    may need to be reworked for the conclusions to be meaningful in the current environment.
