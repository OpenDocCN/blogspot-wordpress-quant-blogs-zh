# Magmasystems Blog: The First First Derivatives/KDB User's Group

First Derivatives held it's first New York KDB User's Group meeting at LiquidNet in new York city on May 28th, 2009\. About 100 people showed up, and it seemed that there was no more than one degree of separation between everyone in the room. Jacob Loveless did a great presentation on the things that he is doing at BGC/Cantor, and Dan Nugent showed a glimpse of a KDB unit testing framework.
