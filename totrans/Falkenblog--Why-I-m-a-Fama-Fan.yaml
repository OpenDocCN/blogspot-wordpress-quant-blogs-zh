    considered Fama a 'lightweight'. This was back in the early 1990s. Unfortunately,
    he inferred something I didn't intend, namely that I too considered him a lightweight
    in the way many opinion columnists will write 'some say welfare reform is a racist
    dog-whistle', so they can say and not say it simultaneously. I replied via a comment
    on Amazon and to him personally, and he accepts my explanation as no mere tendentious
    parsing of that statement (though clearly, when people don't infer what I imply,
    I'm guilty of not saying things as well as I could).

    alphas, or whether to use Lagrange Multiplier or Likelihood Ratio Tests. The thought
    was that the theory was basically correct, where expected returns are a linear
    function of a covariance with something, and so the really important insights
    would be found via ever more sophisticated econometric techniques.

- en: It wasn't a dumb idea, but it was wrong. CAPM betas couldn't be saved, and rejecting
    them via these tests didn't really point to what was wrong. Fama is now one of
    the most respected names in finance because he has championed a model that seems
    to work, and part of his persuasion involved simply cross-tabbing average returns
    by size, then beta. This showed that the standard CAPM betas were untenable as
    measures of risk, because when one does this beta is unrelated to average returns,
    and these average returns are our best estimates of expected returns. He not only
    changed the focus from covariances to long-short portfolios that (conceivably)
    proxy a risk factor, but from abstruse statistics to cross-tabbing.

- en: I admire Fama for his clear arguments, his intellectual integrity (he changed
    his mind on the CAPM betas, he didn't jump on the momentum bandwagon and merely
    said 'it's a puzzle') and also his defense of efficient markets, which is often
    maligned by to my mind remains a pillar of finance. That is, a healthy respect
    for the default assumption that it simple profit rules are rare is valuable disposition,
    otherwise one chases all sorts of overfit will-o'-the-wisps. So, my mention that
    Fama was once considered a lightweight was meant to give some color to how finance
    has changed in methodology, which is reflected by what kinds of research and academics
    are considered top shelf.

- en: Rigor is a good thing, but it should never be more precise than the data allow,
    and as most of our tenable theories are simply about whether certain coefficients
    are zero, positive or negative (eg, for CAPM betas), not what the 11th digit is,
    the distinction between Wald, Likelihood ratio, and Lagrange Multiplier tests
    is moot. Unfortunately, there is still a rigor bias in financial theory, why so
    many important results are in lesser tier journals like the
