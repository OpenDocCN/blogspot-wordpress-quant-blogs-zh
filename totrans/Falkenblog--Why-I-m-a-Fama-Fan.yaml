- en: . One point I made he found irksome was where I noted my Northwestern professors
    considered Fama a 'lightweight'. This was back in the early 1990s. Unfortunately,
    he inferred something I didn't intend, namely that I too considered him a lightweight
    in the way many opinion columnists will write 'some say welfare reform is a racist
    dog-whistle', so they can say and not say it simultaneously. I replied via a comment
    on Amazon and to him personally, and he accepts my explanation as no mere tendentious
    parsing of that statement (though clearly, when people don't infer what I imply,
    I'm guilty of not saying things as well as I could).

    alphas, or whether to use Lagrange Multiplier or Likelihood Ratio Tests. The thought
    was that the theory was basically correct, where expected returns are a linear
    function of a covariance with something, and so the really important insights
    would be found via ever more sophisticated econometric techniques.

- en: It wasn't a dumb idea, but it was wrong. CAPM betas couldn't be saved, and rejecting
    them via these tests didn't really point to what was wrong. Fama is now one of
    the most respected names in finance because he has championed a model that seems
    to work, and part of his persuasion involved simply cross-tabbing average returns
    by size, then beta. This showed that the standard CAPM betas were untenable as
    measures of risk, because when one does this beta is unrelated to average returns,
    and these average returns are our best estimates of expected returns. He not only
    changed the focus from covariances to long-short portfolios that (conceivably)
    proxy a risk factor, but from abstruse statistics to cross-tabbing.

- en: I admire Fama for his clear arguments, his intellectual integrity (he changed
    his mind on the CAPM betas, he didn't jump on the momentum bandwagon and merely
    said 'it's a puzzle') and also his defense of efficient markets, which is often
    maligned by to my mind remains a pillar of finance. That is, a healthy respect
    for the default assumption that it simple profit rules are rare is valuable disposition,
    otherwise one chases all sorts of overfit will-o'-the-wisps. So, my mention that
    Fama was once considered a lightweight was meant to give some color to how finance
    has changed in methodology, which is reflected by what kinds of research and academics
    are considered top shelf.

  zh: 我钦佩法马清晰的论点，他的思想正直（他改变了对CAPM贝塔的看法，没有跟风动量论，并且只是说“这是个难题”），还有他对有效市场的捍卫，虽然这经常受到诋毁，但在我看来仍然是金融的支柱。也就是说，对默认假设的健康尊重，即简单的利润规则是稀有的，这种态度很有价值，否则人们会不断追逐各种过度拟合的妖魔。因此，我提到法马一度被认为是轻浮的，是为了给出金融方法论如何改变的一些色彩，这反映了哪些研究和学者被认为是顶尖的。
- en: Rigor is a good thing, but it should never be more precise than the data allow,
    and as most of our tenable theories are simply about whether certain coefficients
    are zero, positive or negative (eg, for CAPM betas), not what the 11th digit is,
    the distinction between Wald, Likelihood ratio, and Lagrange Multiplier tests
    is moot. Unfortunately, there is still a rigor bias in financial theory, why so
    many important results are in lesser tier journals like the

  zh: 严谨是一件好事，但它永远都不应该比数据更精确，而且我们大多数可信的理论只是关于某些系数是否为零、正数或负数（比如CAPM贝塔），而不是第11位是什么，所以对Wald、似然比和拉格朗日乘数检验的区别是无关紧要的。不幸的是，金融理论中仍然存在严谨偏见，为什么这么多重要的结果出现在次要期刊，比如
