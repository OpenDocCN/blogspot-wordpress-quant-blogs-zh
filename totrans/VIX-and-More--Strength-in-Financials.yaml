    – and when it comes to front running any FOMC announcements, stupidity often rules
    the day.

    week or so.  Looking at the [XLF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLF)
    SPDR, we have an impressive two day bottom put in last Tuesday and Wednesday,
    with a pop of 20% from a bottom of 24.11 and a potential cross of the 50 day SMA
    less than 1% away from current levels.  The volume at the bottom was impressive
    and has held up fairly well on the way up.  Certainly a cross of the 50 day SMA
    and a turning up of the 20 day counterpart must bode well for that sector and
    increase the likelihood that this month’s plunge will ultimately turn out to be
    the bottom.

    the Fed is doing the right things to shore up our financial systems, provide appropriate
    liquidity, and keep the dominoes from getting any wobblier.  Presumably, the markets
    have priced in a 50 basis point move by the Fed today and have valued the financial
    sector on the assumption that solutions to the current situation – though they
    may be slow to take root and turn out to be expensive – are going to ultimately
    resolve the current credit crisis.

    means anything – and it usually does – it could mean that there is still a lot
    of easy money to be made cherry picking some of the stronger names that have beaten
    down with the rest of the sector.
