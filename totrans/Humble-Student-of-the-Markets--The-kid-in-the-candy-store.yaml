    assessment. Just for fun I ran a quick screen of low-priced beaten up financials
    with heavy insider buying and came up with a moderately sized list, which is shown
    below. It’s easy to see how some of the bottom-up managers are behaving like kids
    in a candy store. You don't see these kinds of values every day. The P/Es of these
    financials are low and they have had significant insider buying in the last six
    months and no insider sales, which is an indication of management confidence.
    In addition, other deep value screens are also showing long lists of stocks with
    good upside potential with solid asset value support.
