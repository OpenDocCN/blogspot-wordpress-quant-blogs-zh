    then comment on my own initial experiences with the iPad 2.

    and manage your files on the go. Directly control your desktop as if you’re sitting
    in front of it, access your computer applications as if they were on your iPad,
    and view or manage files directly from your iPad/iPhone.”'

    largest value would be in offloading some peripheral trading or general computing
    functionality, such as monitoring news events and the like.

    not just for news, but for analysis, trade execution, position monitoring and
    the like. I found the thinkorswim and Interactive Brokers trading apps to be excellent
    and I was also pleasantly surprised by the

    OptionsHouse and while these are fine initial efforts, in my opinion, they have
    a way to go before they can be considered in the same league as the three mentioned
    above.

    Bloomberg terminal) also have apps. I experimented with CNBC and Bloomberg for
    iPad and came away with the impression that these are both adequate general-purpose

    me keep on top of any sort of extreme market conditions when I am traveling, but
    it always feels as if I am about 95% in the dark in terms of news and what is
    really moving the markets. With the iPad, I can see iPad trading as being almost
    comparable to laptop-based trading, but in an more transportable form factor and
    perhaps a simpler and more direct user interface.
