    have come up with in the financial industry. It's even more fun to see who has
    patented what. In the search page, type your favorite company into the "Assignee"
    field. Even though you and I can create a great technology, and we *may* be able
    to be listed as the Inventor, we usually have to Assign the work to the company
    we work for.

    some Merrill Lynch patents list (the late) Don Trojan and Ed Keenan as the Inventors.
    I know for a fact that Don and Ed were managers at Merrill, and in my opinion,
    probably never got anywhere near the technology. (Ed was my wife's first boss
    at ML, and was a pure manager. Don was my wife's boss at Drexel Burnham Lambert.)

    on the Images link. However, you need to download a TIF viewer for your web browser
