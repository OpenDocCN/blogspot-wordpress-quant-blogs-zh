    remind me of Bertrand Russell's observation that "If any philosopher had been
    asked for a definition of infinity, he might have produced some unintelligible
    rigmarole, but he would certainly not have been able to give a definition that
    had any meaning at all."

    on his ideas. Most interestingly, they spend about half the time discussing the
    'paradox' that he was also a virulent Nazi. How could someone so wise is the ways
    of philosophy be so wrong on something so important?

    Chomsky is a great linguist and an apologist for every anti-American illiberal
    regime, that Isaac Newton believed in Biblically inspired numerology, or that
    someone who is really good at a parochial models of economic interaction would
    support socialism. My beliefs are not shaken by the fact that someone really smart
    thinks the opposite on some political issue--what crackpot idea does not have
    someone really smart who believes it? People have multiple selves, in some contexts,
    agreeable and insightful, in others closed and clueless.

    the sense that one can logically prove any currently popular idea is 'wrong',
    and smart people are good at logic, not prioritizing uncertain hypotheses. Over
    time wrong ideas, like communism, have their wrongness exposed via empirical contradictions,
    as when the Eastern Bloc was neither more prosperous or free than the West even
    though it was putatively for 'the people'. In 1950, most of the best economists
    thought socialism would economically dominate the perceived anarchy and inefficiency
    of market oriented economies.
