    is a loss, and buy stocks (or futures) when there is a gain in the market value
    of the portfolio, in order to maintain a constant leverage ratio of 3\. This is
    also identical to what Kelly formula would prescribe, a methodology discussed

    Both Russell 1000 and 2000 have f at about 1.8\. This means that since the funds
    are leveraged at 3, there is a real possibility that sustained losses could ruin
    the funds (i.e. NAV going to zero unless new capital is injected, which, er...,
    reminds me of a Ponzi scheme). So I would argue that not only should an investor
    not hold these funds for the long term, the funds themselves should not be leveraged
    at this level. Otherwise, it is a disaster waiting to happen.
