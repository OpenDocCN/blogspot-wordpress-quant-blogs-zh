    – its mostly the shop near Bank subway.  Like so many shops, TM Lewis have the
    usual offer/sale marketing in the window. Over the last 2 years based on non-statistical
    data 🙂 I’ve come to the conclusion that you can tell how well the UK economy is
    doing based on the current “sale” price of shirts.  The general shirt “sale” index
    seems to fluctuate between 5 shirts for £100, and 1 shirt for £80.  Anyway, curious
    if anyone else has their own made-up commute index 🙂
