    While earnings were marginally interesting, much more amusing was the corresponding
    hiccup in intraday trading. This event provides an opportunity to dig into TAQ
    data, view through a HFT lens, and build intuition from some elegant ideas due
    to Mendelbrot, Clark, and Ané.

    Needless to say, successful prediction of the sign for future returns is quite
    interesting from a trading perspective. Traditionally, only univariate return
    series were considered; [Anatolyev (2008)](http://www.nes.ru/~sanatoly/Papers/DepRatio.pdf)
    is an exception, modeling two or more interrelated markets via dependence ratios.
    This literature tends to be a bit obtuse, due to commonly unstated stylistic assumptions
    regarding conditional return dynamics.
