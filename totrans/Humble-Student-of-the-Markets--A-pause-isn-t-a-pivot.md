# Humble Student of the Markets: A pause isn't a pivot

Now that the market has had over a week to absorb the implications of the last Fed rate decision and incoming data since the meeting, here is where we stand.

The Fed made an important change in its statement that hinted it was preparing to pause interest rate increases. Even though the Fed raised rates by 25 basis points at the May meeting, it made an important change in its language from the March meeting, which stated:

> The Committee anticipates that some additional policy firming may be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time.

The May meeting statement allowed for a pause in rate hikes, with the usual nod to data dependency.

> The Committee will closely monitor incoming information and assess the implications for monetary policy. In determining the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time,

Since the conclusion of the May meeting, the April Jobs Report came in mixed. While the headline increase in non-farm payroll employment was ahead of expectations, the figures for the previous two months were dramatically revised downward. The April CPI report came in slightly softer than expected. Headline YoY fell from 5.0% to 4.9%, which was below market expectations, while core CPI was unchanged from the previous month at 5.5%. As well, PPI came in softer than expected. Overall, inflation has been slowly decelerating. The target Fed Funds rate of 5.00–5.25% is now above the core PCE rate of 4.2%. Historically, the Fed has kept the Fed Funds rate above its preferred inflation metric of core PCE whenever inflation has been above its 2% target. 

Is it time for a pause? Under what conditions would the Fed pivot to cutting rates?
