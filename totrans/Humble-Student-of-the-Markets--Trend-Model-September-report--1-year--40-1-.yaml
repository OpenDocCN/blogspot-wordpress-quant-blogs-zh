- en: For readers who are unfamiliar with my Trend Model, it is a market timing, or
    asset allocation, model which uses trend following techniques as applied to commodity
    and global stock market prices to generates a composite Risk-On/Risk-Off signal
    (risk-on, risk-off or neutral). I have begun updating readers on the Trend Model
    signals on a weekly basis (for the last comment, see

    signal changed from negative to positive, as buy signals and the red down arrows,

    signals.

    interesting, there is no substitute for actual performance. As a proof of concept,
    I started to manage a small (about 100K) account that traded long, inverse and
    leveraged ETFs on the major US market averages and, on occasion, sector and industry
    ETFs. Trading decisions were based on Trend Model signals combined with some short-term
    sentiment indicators. The inception date of the account was September 30, 2013
    and the chart below represents an interim report card of that account.

    is intended to be an absolute return vehicle. While I do show the SPY total return,
    which includes re-invested dividends, for illustrative purposes, the SP 500 is
    not an appropriate benchmark for measuring the performance of this modeling technique.

    25.1% YTD and 40.1% for one year, or from inception. However, I would also like
    to point out that turnover averaged about 190%

- en: While these results are promising, I consider the Trend Model to be untested
    by stressful markets. I continue to be concerned about how the Trend Model would
    behave at major market turning points. In the past year, equities have more or
    less been rising steadily without a correction of 10% and pullbacks have mostly
    been short and shallow. While account performance has been admirable during these
    minor market hiccups, the biggest test for the Trend Model is how it performs
    during the volatility seen in major corrections. In particular, how will the Trend
    Model navigate the initial downturn, the volatility of the bottoming period and
    the subsequent rally?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: My concern is based on a feature of the underlying design principles of the
    Trend Model, whose buy and sell decisions are based on the application of trend
    following models to commodity and global equity prices, supplemented by some shorter
    term sentiment indicators. Trend following models suffer from a well-known problem
    as they are subject to whipsaw in sideways trend-less markets. While the addition
    of the short term sentiment models mitigate those effects, they do not entirely
    eliminate them.

    at a steady rate since late 2012\. The key test of the Trend Model will occur
    when it is faced with choppier markets such as the ones seen during the 2010-2012
    period (though the above chart of actual model signals does show promising results
    for 2011 and 2012).

    of the Trend Model account. While the sample size is still quite small (n=12)
    and therefore the conclusions highly conjectural, the distribution of returns
    is intriguing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To explain, the x-axis of the chart shows the monthly returns of the account,
    while the y-axis shows the number of times, or frequency, of the monthly returns
    during the test period. As with most financially based returns, you would expect
    a bell-shaped Gaussian return distribution, which I have sketched out in black.
    The anomaly to the chart is the relatively high count of negative returns at about
    the -2% level, but note the zero frequency to the left indicating that there were
    no large monthly draw-downs. My preliminary (and highly conjectural) conclusion
    is that this return distribution shows ***the Trend Model is able to limit monthly
    losses while allowing winners to run*** (on the right of the chart).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One possible problem with that conclusion is that the occasions when the negative
    returns occurred were consecutive, which resulted in a total draw-down of roughly
    7%. that occurred in the whipsaw period that I described before in Q1 2014 If
    the three draw-down months were to be compressed together into a single month,
    the chart would then look like the one below, which incidentally preserves the
    bell-shaped Gaussian distribution of the chart.
