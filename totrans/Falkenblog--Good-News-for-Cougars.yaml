    old women. According to a new study, published Monday in the online journal PLoS

- en: ), paternal age at conception generates a linear decrease in child IQ, whereas
    maternal age rises sharply to age 25, then rises very slightly throughout her
    life. See graph below cropped from the paper. The solid line is the IQ of the
    child as a function of the mother's age, the dotted line as a function of the
    father's age. They held constant race, gestational age, socioeconomic factors,
    marital status, other parent's age, and mental illness, and had about 33,000 observations.
    Sounds pretty solid.

    points. Then again, if I had kids in my early 20's, they wouldn't be here, some
    other DNA would, so they really can't complain. Plus, they enjoy the advantage
    of a ripened mother. I'm sure they will complain anyway.
