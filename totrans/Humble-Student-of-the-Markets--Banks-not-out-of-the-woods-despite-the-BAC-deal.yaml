    the fact that the Buffett rescue was a sweetheart deal (not everyone can get a
    6% coupon on preferred shares senior to the common, so that if everything blows
    up the common shareholders eat the loss first, plus Buffett gets common share
    warrants as a "sweetener"), the banks have rallied but remain in a relative downtrend.
    I would like to see the relative downtrend broken and, ideally, a rally above
    the relative support line (which has become resistance) broken in June.

    risk,  tells the same story. This was a nice rally, to be sure. But it was not
    enough to change the picture of a banking sector that is deteriorating.

    financial system much in the same way that Irene is menacing the US east coast.'
