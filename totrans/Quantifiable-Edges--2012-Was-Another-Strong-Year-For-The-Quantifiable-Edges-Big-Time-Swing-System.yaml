- en: I’ve updated the Quantifiable Edges Big Time Swing System overview page with
    results through January 3rd, when the most recent trade closed out. There is not
    a trade currently open. Since the system only averages about 1 trade per month,
    I typically update the results bi-annually. Since the last update after July 2,
    2012, through January 3, 2013, the signals produced a net return of 9.04% for
    SPY (including dividends, commissions of $0.01/share, and an assumed interest
    rate on cash of 0.1%).  This was achieved with 6 long-side trades and 0 short
    trades.  Five of the six trades made money.  The system is also again at new equity
    highs.  In total, 2012 posted a net gain of 9.12%, and 2013 is already up 2.51%.

- en: The Big Time Swing System provides easy to follow mechanical rules. The standard
    parameters are not optimized and have performed quite well (they are the ones
    used for all performance metrics). There are only about 11 trades per year averaging
    7 trading days per trade. All entries and exits are either at the open or the
    close. And to be sure you have everything set up properly traders may follow the
    private purchasers-only blog that tracks all SPY signals and possible entry/exit
    levels. This service is free for 12 months from the date of purchase.

- en: For system developers looking for a system that they can use as a base to build
    their own system from, the Big Time Swing is an attractive option. It is all open-coded
    and comes complete with a substantial amount of background historical research.
    And since it is only in the market about ¼ of the time, it can easily be combined
    with other systems to provide greater efficiency of capital. Once you’re ready
    to try and improve the system yourself you can also refer to the system manual
    or the August 2010 purchaser-only webinar – both of which discuss numerous ideas
    for customization.
