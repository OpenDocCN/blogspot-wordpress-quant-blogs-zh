    matter". Add some self interest (envy, greed), and look at the implications. I
    wouldn't think this way if I didn't think it worked.

- en: ', a website that encourages weight loss and really any goal. It was founded
    by an economist based on the idea that incentives matter. I have wanted to lose
    some extra middle aged blubber for a while, but at the margin I had no real motivation
    (putting socks in the hamper would help my sex life more than buff abs). I knew
    I needed some outside force, so I created a contract at Stickk such that I had
    to lose 2lbs every week for 9 weeks or I would pay $50 for each violation to a
    charity that supported things I did not like (the anti-charity option).'

    229, 227 etc. I gave them my credit card, and I had to report my weekly weight,
    and get a referee of my choosing to validate my progress. I chose a colleague
    at work, who would look at me on a scale I brought in. One could cheat the system,
    but when you involve another person, it''s less likely. As an economist, I liked
    the idea: just give the incentive, make it strong, and let me figure how to get
    there. The algorithm is thus greatly simplified compared to Weight Watcher plans
    that suggest counting calories.'

    seems to want to be a Facebook, allowing me to write commitment contracts on anything
    all while keeping up to date on my progress with pictures, etc.
