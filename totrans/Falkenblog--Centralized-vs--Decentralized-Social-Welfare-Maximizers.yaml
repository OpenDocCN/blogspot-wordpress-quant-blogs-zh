    better founded than the belief in the supernatural gifts of kings or noblemen.
    Just as misguided is the idea that good things, as decided by a majority, should
    be mandated. It should be remembered that our current prosperity and freedom have
    resulted from unwanted gradual changes in mores related to property rights, which
    when firmly established sparked the Industrial Revolution. Nobody planned that.
    Property rights were not created to win wars or eliminate poverty, though they
    did that as well as many other good things.

    encourages self-interested agents to do what they think is best, and produces
    results we do not foresee let alone intend. It is the ultimate decentralized system.
    In contrast, a system based on state regulations and monopolies (eg, public schools,
    utilities) is centralized. The push for more centralization dominates the state,
    academics, and media because these are the people who are good at articulating
    high-minded policies and are pissed-off that they have to sell them, as in most
    cases consumers don't want their solutions.

    or political strategists for the organization. Far from being public servants,
    this leadership class will inevitably grow to dominate the organization's power
    structures, and they tend to favor their friends and family. By controlling who
    has access to information, those in power centralize their power with little accountability,
    due to the apathy, indifference and non-participation most rank-and-file members
    have in relation to their organization's decision-making processes. The official

    lots of bad ideas too. Your average politician has many fewer good ideas. Unfortunately,
    when the state creates a new policy or agency, it doesn't compete to survive,
    it just grows like a cancer. Sometimes they redefine their mandate when the initial
    one becomes less popular (eg, NASA is focused now on climate change and blockchain
    technology). Other times they redefine success metrics so that they always appear
    to work (Obamacare was about improving health, but when mortality rates rose supporters
    simply pointed to higher insurance coverage). The Department of Education's mandate
    is so vague it is difficult to measure their output, and with defense agencies
    like the NSA or CIA their productivity is necessarily secret; they do very little
    outside the occasional grandstanding about some new report, and people are happy
    if they don't bother them. Lastly, agencies like the TSA who handle airport security
    are necessary and have a monopoly, so their incentive to improve service is completely

    is that in the private sector businesses eventually stop doing things that lose
    money. Either the company owners get tired of losing money, the bank forecloses,
    or they run out of whatever cash they have. A bad regulation (eg, 10% of all gas
    in my state must be ethanol) just continues because it costs the lawmakers nothing;
    a pointless agency can point to anecdotes because there literally is no bottom
    line. Most government 'production' is measured by how much is spent on them, as
    if spending money on health care is equivalent to generating that amount of value,
    and debates center on whether the next budget will increase by 2 or 4% as opposed
    to junking the existing enterprise and starting over from scratch. Only a decentralized
    system of individuals permits failure, and without failure, capital and labor

    focused on banning railroad rebates, as if one of the greatest specters facing
    consumers was predatory pricing, which supposedly caused smaller firms to go bankrupt,
    and then allowed the remaining firm to raise prices. Banning price discounts to
    prevent monopoly power is something so stupid only an intellectual can believe
    it, as falling real prices is the essence of productivity increases, and prices
    do not fall in concert, but piecemeal, by the more efficient firms. By outlawing
    price discounts, the more efficient firms and processes will not grow to take
    over the way they would in a free market. In this way insiders can build a mote
    around their inefficient but profitable businesses and share their largess with
    government officials via the revolving door among their executive suites, and
    mutually supporting each other in less obvious ways (eg, when banks supported

    optimal growth problem. Everyone is in favor of such productivity because there
    are no losers, just one happy representative agent. In contrast, if Joe invented
    a hair-cutting machine that enabled him to cut the hair of 5 men at a time, his
    invention would deprive 4 of his colleagues a job. If then Joe cuts his price
    from the market rate of $15 to $12, the cost to society for cutting hair went
    from $75 to $60, but Joe now rakes in $60 while his 4 colleagues lost $15 each.
    As most people's budget for haircuts is immaterial and given utility increases
    at a decreasing rate, that lowers social welfare, QED. Further, a muck-raking

    but as Indians had no records or even a conception of private property, there
    was no way to specify a rightful owner before. Yet Penn's initial ownership was
    irrelevant, the key merely that someone had to own it before it could be developed.
    It is a good example of the

    social welfare, and they are not obliged to answer the question 'how will this
    product help the world?' Airbnb, Uber, or bitcoin would not exist if they asked
    permission first. Even computers, which most white collar workers consider indispensable,

    pooh-poohing computers as much as admitting economics was not very good at modeling
    these new technologies. Those who demand we fully know how any new service or

    in a competitive market, is not blind faith, but rather something that cannot

    from zealous advocates and adversaries driven by all the virtues and vices common
    to men, and only decided by consumers who prefer their products to whatever else
    they might wish to buy. To presume a state can do this efficiently and will not
    instead become a self-interested hypocrite monopolist more powerful than any firm
    or private industry, ignores history, human nature, politics, and economics.
