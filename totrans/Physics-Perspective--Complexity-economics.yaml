    era. We believe what best characterizes the new era is its acceptance that the
    economy is complex, and thus that it might be called “the complexity era.”

    science and its applications in physics, biology and economics for a decade, and
    the ideas are certainly far more fashionable now than they were before.

- en: But again -- what is complexity? One key point that Holt and colleagues make
    is that complexity science recognizes and accepts that many systems in nature
    cannot be captured in simple and timeless equations with elegant analytical solutions.
    That may have been true with quantum electrodynamics and general relativity, but
    it's decidedly not true for most messy real world systems -- and this goes for
    physics just as much as it does for economics. Indeed, I think it is fair to say
    that much of the original impetus behind complexity science came out of physics
    in the 1970s and 80s as the field turned toward the study of collective organization
    in disordered systems -- spin glasses and glassy materials, granular matter, the
    dynamics of fracture and so on. There are lots of equations and models used in
    the physics of such systems, but no one has the intention or hope of discovering
    the final theory that would wrap up everything in a tidy formula or set of axioms.

    using a proliferation of models, every one of which is partial and approximate
    and incomplete, which together help to illuminate key relationships -- especially
    relationships between the properties of things at a lower level (atoms, molecules,
    automobiles or people) and those at a higher level (crystal structures, traffic
    jams or aggregate economic outcomes).

    a task that I'm not sure is really worth the effort. But they do arrive at a useful
    distinction between three broad views -- a general view, a dynamic view, and a
    computational view. The second of these seems most interesting and directly related
    to emerging research focusing on instabilities and rich dynamics in economic systems.
    As stated by Rosser, a system is "dynamically complex" if...

    state, but has rich internal dynamics which persist. I'm not sure this definition
    covers all the bases, but it comes close and certainly strikes in the right direction.

    viewpoint is currently altering the landscape of economic research. I wouldn''t
    quibble with the list: evolutionary game theory is bringing institutions more
    deeply into economic analysis, ecological economics is actually bringing the consideration
    of biology into economics (imagine that!), behavioural economics is taking account
    of how real people behave (again, what a thought!), agent-based models are providing
    a powerful alternative to analytical models, and so on.'

    emphasized -- the absolute need to recognize that what happens at higher macro-levels
    in a system often depends in a highly non-intuitive way on what happens at the
    micro-level. One of the principle barriers to progress in economics and finance,
    in my opinion, has been the the systematic effort by theorists over decades to
    avoid facing up to this micro-to-macro problem, typically through various analytical
    tricks. The most powerful trick -- a pair of tricks, really -- is to assume 1)
    that individuals are rational (hence making the study of human behaviour a problem
    not of psychology but of pure mathematics) and 2) assuming (in what is called
    the representative agent method) that the the behaviour of collective groups,
    indeed entire markets and economies, can be calculated as the simple sum of the
    rational actions of the people making it up.

    and markets rich and their dynamics surprising. Having done this, economics becomes
    a mathematical task of exploring the nature of rational behaviour -- it essentially
    places the root of complex collective economic outcomes inside the logical mind
    of the individual.

    science that very simple things, in interaction, can give rise to astonishing
    complexity in a collective group. We should expect the same in social science:
    many surprising and non-intuitive phenomena at the collective level may reflect
    nothing tricky at all in the behaviour of individuals, but only the tendency for
    rich structures and dynamics to emerge in collective systems, created by myriad
    pathways of interaction among the system''s parts.'

- en: Taking this point seriously is what I think most of complexity science -- as
    applied to social systems -- is about. It's certainly central to everything I
    write about under the phrase the "physics of finance." I take physics in the broad
    sense as the study of how organization and order and form well up in collective
    systems. It so happened that physics started out on this project in the context
    of physical stuff, electrons, atoms, molecules and so on, but that's merely a
    historical accident. The insights and methods physics has developed aren't bound
    by the nature of the particular things being discussed, and this project of understanding
    the emergence of collective order and organisation goes well beyond the traditional
    subject matter of physics.

    and a complexity approach have not occurred in macroeconomics. In fact, the evolution
    of macroeconomic thinking in the United States has gone the other way. By that,
    we mean that there has been a movement away from a rough and ready macro theory
    that characterized the macroeconomics of the 1960s toward a theoretically analytic
    macro theory based on abstract, representative agent models that rely heavily
    on the assumptions of equilibrium. This macro work goes under the name new Classical,
    Real Business cycle, and the dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) theory,
    and has become the mainstream in the U.S.

    write in their essay is true, it cannot possibly stay this way for long. Economics
    as a whole is changing very rapidly and macro can't remain as it is indefinitely.
