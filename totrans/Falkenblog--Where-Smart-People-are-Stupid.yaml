- en: George Orwell famously stated that 'There are some things so stupid that only
    an intellectual can believe them', and this create biases peculiar to our intellectual
    elites. John Jost does research about how many oppressed people rationalize their
    oppression, becoming 'Uncle Toms', aiding and abetting the unjust status quo via
    their agreeablenesss. For example, he finds that when threatened, people tend
    to grasp comforting stereotypes, such as that rich people are more intelligent
    than poor people, and that fat people are lazier than skinny people. Crazy talk.

  zh: 乔治·奥威尔曾经说过，“有些事情是如此愚蠢，只有知识分子才会相信”，这导致我们知识精英特有的偏见。约翰·约斯特对压迫者如何合理化自己的压迫行为进行了研究，成为“大图姆”，通过他们的顺从而推动和支持不公正的现状。例如，他发现当人们受到威胁时，倾向于用安慰性刻板印象，比如富人比穷人更聪明，胖人比瘦人更懒惰来缓解压力。荒谬的言论。

- en: Less intelligent people tend to confuse 'tend' with 'always' more often, so
    if you say men are stronger than women, they would be more prone think this implies
    this is true for every possible pair of men and women. That is clearly a logical
    error in inference. The twentieth century's most singular intellectual insight
    is that discrimination—the idea that certain groups like women or blacks are all
    different than, say, white men—is morally wrong and inefficient. Thus, every New
    York Times article noting some difference between groups of people has a perfunctory
    paragraph stating, for example, that "this does not imply all women are not as
    strong as all men", just in case anyone made such an inference.

  zh: 较不聪明的人往往更容易混淆“倾向”和“总是”，所以如果你说男性比女性更强壮，他们更容易认为这意味着对每对男性和女性来说都是真实的。这显然是一种逻辑推理错误。二十世纪最独特的智力洞察是歧视——认为某些群体如妇女或黑人与白人男性不同——在道德上是错误的，也是低效的。因此，《纽约时报》中的每篇文章都会注意到人们群体之间的差异，例如“这并不意味着所有女性都不如所有男性强壮”，只是为了万一有人做出这样的推断。
- en: Modern intellectuals are so afraid of stereotyping they can no longer generalize
    about people as intelligently as the great unwashed. The thought that obese people
    are lazier than average seems not merely mean, but illogical, to many intellectuals.
    Thinking that there are many poor persons much smarter than many rich persons,
    yet on average rich people are smarter than poor people, does not imply we should
    sterilize the poor, or never listen, hire, or marry a less intelligent person.
    Yet to assume the wealthy are just as intelligent as the poor would imply a conspiracy
    so vast and efficient at working to offset the natural advantages implied by the
    nature of 'intelligence', defies credulity. Almost all stereotypes are true as
    generalizations, a useful fact plebians believe more than intellectuals. This
    guy seems to think the only way to believe pathetic people are not as virtuous
    or admirable as rich people rationalizes our current, arbitrary hierarchy.

  zh: 现代知识分子如此害怕刻板印象，以至于不能像无知者那样对人们进行智能的概括。认为肥胖的人比平均水平更懒惰似乎不仅仅是含混不清，而且还不合逻辑，这是许多知识分子的看法。认为有许多比许多富人更聪明的穷人，但平均而言，富人比穷人更聪明，这并不意味着我们应该不听取穷人的建议，不雇佣或不嫁给一个较不聪明的人。然而，假设富人和穷人一样聪明，那将意味着一个如此广泛而有效的阴谋，用来抵消“智力”的自然优势所蕴含的假设，这是令人难以置信的。几乎所有刻板印象的一般化陈述都是真实的，这是一个平民相信的有用事实，但不是知识分子。这个人似乎认为相信可怜之人不如富人那么有美德或令人赞美，可以合理化我们目前的，任意的等级制度。
