- en: George Orwell famously stated that 'There are some things so stupid that only
    an intellectual can believe them', and this create biases peculiar to our intellectual
    elites. John Jost does research about how many oppressed people rationalize their
    oppression, becoming 'Uncle Toms', aiding and abetting the unjust status quo via
    their agreeablenesss. For example, he finds that when threatened, people tend
    to grasp comforting stereotypes, such as that rich people are more intelligent
    than poor people, and that fat people are lazier than skinny people. Crazy talk.

- en: Less intelligent people tend to confuse 'tend' with 'always' more often, so
    if you say men are stronger than women, they would be more prone think this implies
    this is true for every possible pair of men and women. That is clearly a logical
    error in inference. The twentieth century's most singular intellectual insight
    is that discrimination—the idea that certain groups like women or blacks are all
    different than, say, white men—is morally wrong and inefficient. Thus, every New
    York Times article noting some difference between groups of people has a perfunctory
    paragraph stating, for example, that "this does not imply all women are not as
    strong as all men", just in case anyone made such an inference.

- en: Modern intellectuals are so afraid of stereotyping they can no longer generalize
    about people as intelligently as the great unwashed. The thought that obese people
    are lazier than average seems not merely mean, but illogical, to many intellectuals.
    Thinking that there are many poor persons much smarter than many rich persons,
    yet on average rich people are smarter than poor people, does not imply we should
    sterilize the poor, or never listen, hire, or marry a less intelligent person.
    Yet to assume the wealthy are just as intelligent as the poor would imply a conspiracy
    so vast and efficient at working to offset the natural advantages implied by the
    nature of 'intelligence', defies credulity. Almost all stereotypes are true as
    generalizations, a useful fact plebians believe more than intellectuals. This
    guy seems to think the only way to believe pathetic people are not as virtuous
    or admirable as rich people rationalizes our current, arbitrary hierarchy.
