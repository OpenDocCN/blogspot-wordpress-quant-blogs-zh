- en: Launched in June 2008, the ELEMENTS S&P Commodity Trends Indicator ETN ([LSC](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/LSC))
    was an immediate hit with retail investors, attracting a considerable volume,
    offering diversification from an equity-heavy portfolio and even using a long-short
    approach to take advantage of both bullish and bearish trends in [commodities](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/commodities).
    By the end of the 2008, the ETF was already up more than 6%.

    and is now down 44% from its 2008 high water mark. The graphic below, from [ETFreplay.com](http://etfreplay.com/),
    shows LSC’s performance relative to broadly diversified commodity ETFs, [RJI](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/RJI)
    and [DJP](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/DJP) over the course of
    the last year. While the graphic alone may make LSC appear to be an attractive
    short, I think it is important to note that the prospectus has historical data
    going back to 2001 which shows excellent long-term performance characteristics.

    or short, or have a neutral position. The one exception is crude oil, where the
    ETF is only allowed to be long or flat. The prospectus lays out the rationale
    for the short restriction on crude oil as follows:'

- en: '*Energy, due to the significant level of its continuous consumption, limited
    reserves, and oil cartel control is subject to rapid price increases in the event
    of perceived or actual shortages. For example, although a problem of this magnitude
    has not occurred historically, if the Index were capable of shorting the energy
    sector and a catastrophe occurred which caused Light Crude prices to surge dramatically
    while the energy Sector allocation was set to short, the Index would lose a significant
    portion of its value on the Light Crude position alone. Because no other sector
    is subject to the same continuous demand with supply and concentration risk, the
    energy sector is never positioned short in the Index.*'
