    “tell,” according to Chris Flanagan, also at Bank of America. He advises investors
    to watch “for the combo of rising yields and rising gold prices to signal impending
    market volatility.” Three consecutive quarters of rising benchmark bond yields
    and gold prices preceded previous market falls including the 1973-1974 bond market
    crash and Black Monday in 1987, he says. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S.
    Treasury has risen to 2.44 percent from 1.77 percent since Trump’s election win.
