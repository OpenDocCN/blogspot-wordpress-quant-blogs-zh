- en: As oil prices have begun to stabilize, there has been a lot of opinions as to
    whether oil has bottomed or not. I thought that I would throw in my 2c worth on
    why I believe the path of least resistance for oil is still down.

    chart of crude oil (WTIC). The yellow bars are the size and duration as the current
    fall in oil since June 2014\. Three other instances look similar in that the drop
    was swift and without a pause (marked with stars: 1986, 1990 and 2008). Two others
    took twice to four times as long to unfold (1997 and 2000).'

    first phase of a bottom, then rallies are typically capped by the 50 day moving
    average. Prices then weaken and then re-test the previous low, sometimes successfully
    and at other times undercut the low. The key feature of a bottom is a positive
    MACD divergence.

    look out six months, however, the price is 56.43 and the 12 month price is 60.01\.
    This upward sloping contango means that any trader with storage could buy oil
    at 49.45 for delivery, hold it and then sell it in six months for 56.43 for a
    tidy 14.2% profit (less carrying costs). A 12-month buy-and-hold will get you
    21%.

- en: The contango has created two effects. First, oil producers typically hedge their
    production with a 6 or 12 month strip contract (e.g. 12 month strip = 1/12 of
    1st month + 1/12 of next month + ... ). The actual realized hedged price is about
    10% higher than the often quoted front month contract. In that sense, things aren't
    as bad as the headlines sound.

- en: In addition, the strongly upward sloping forward curve has encouraged trading
    desks and hedge funds to take advantage of the contango by buying the physical,
    storing it and selling it forward. Add a bit of leverage to that trade and you
    have yourself a very big payday. The contango has therefore created an inventory
    level that's off the charts (via

    not based on actual production," she said. "Those are more geopolitical factors."
    Croft also said some of these external geopolitical factors have yet to filter
    through the oil market.

    for oil prices, but my inkling is that the near-term direction for oil is down.
