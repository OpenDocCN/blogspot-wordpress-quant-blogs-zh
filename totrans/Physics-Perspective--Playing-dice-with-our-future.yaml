- en: in Bloomberg. Touch on politics, I've learned, and you get an order of magnitude
    more comments than you do otherwise, and this is proof again (not that I choose
    my topics this way). Many of the comments seem particularly vicious, but I did
    venture to wade into the Tea Party/Government Shut Down saga, so there's no surprise.

- en: The article is motivated by my perception -- right or wrong? -- that many people
    in the Tea Party movement (and many Republicans in general, perhaps) have a naively
    safe view of the world. They seem to believe in the inherent superiority of America
    and the American System -- in American Exceptionalism, if you want -- and find
    it hard to imagine that we could easily slip way down in the world relative to
    other nations. This belief persists despite all kinds of statistics showing that
    our standing in things like education, public health, life expectancy, quality
    of life, etc. has indeed dropped way down in recent decades.

- en: This kind of naive belief in a guaranteed good future breeds, I think, dangerous
    complacency regarding current policy. We can reduce taxes, disregard investment
    in infrastructure, not worry about trying to improve the healthcare system, etc.,
    because we are, after all, NUMBER 1, aren't we! Well no, and keeping standards
    high in anything from education to communications infrastructure demands investment
    and hard work, not just slogans and tax breaks. And defaulting on the debt might
    actually be quite a good way to screw up our economy quite quickly.

    to evolution, adaptation and extinction -- but that's how my brain works. The
    239 comments so far make it clear that quite a few people think I'm pretty daft,
    although roughly half seem to agree.

    post shows the words used most frequently by people in Tea Party focus groups
    when talking about the country and Obama. They really seem deeply frightened that
    Obama is trying to turn the US into a Soviet state where old style (white) Americans
    won''t be welcome and a majority gay/black/hispanic/other immigrant population
    of slackers will live entirely off government programs. As Edsall notes:'
