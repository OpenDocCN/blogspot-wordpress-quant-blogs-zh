    framework is based on technical analysis and not economic analysis.*** A market
    cycle behaves like an economic cycle, but it only describes the market response
    to expectations, not the actual economic result. As an example, the economic cycle
    started at the trough of the Lehman Crisis in 2008-09, but I believe that the
    market cycle actually began in late 2011, when the markets got over the trauma
    of the debt ceiling impasse in Washington and the ECB acted to relieve the pressures
    of the eurozone crisis with its LTRO program.

    stocks have rallied but have faltered. Consumer oriented mid-cycle sectors like
    the Consumer Discretionary sector have also weakened, though the corporate mid-cycle
    names have wobbled and their leadership position is shaky. Meanwhile, late cycle
    (Materials and Energy) and defensive sectors (Utilities, Consumer Staples and
    Telecom) are all turning up.

    If I had to watch one chart as a key "tell" for the market, it would be the relative
    performance of the Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index (CYC) against the market. As
    the chart below of the CYC/SPX ratio shows, cyclical stocks remain in a wobbly
    relative uptrend. Depending on how you draw the trend line, this ratio has either
    violated the relative uptrend or has experienced minor violations of the relative
    uptrend.
