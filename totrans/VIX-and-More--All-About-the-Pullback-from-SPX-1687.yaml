- en: Today the S&P 500 index fell 2.5% and at its low was more than 102 points lower
    than the all-time high of 1687.18 from May 22^(nd). At times like this I am amazed
    by how many requests I get to update the table of pullbacks I have been posting
    periodically since the current bull market began in March 2009.

- en: As the table below shows, the current peak-to-trough decline represents a 6.1%
    pullback from the all-time high and ranks tenth of twenty-one pullbacks during
    this period. The mean pullback during this bull market is 7.0% and would suggest
    a bottom of SPX 1568\. The median pullback is only 5.6% and would have brought
    the index down to 1593.

    must be subject to before stocks should feel to rebound or that there is a certain
    amount of time that the bulls should spend in the penalty box (the mean peak-to-trough
    decline lasts 18 days, while the median is 7 days), but at some point the severity
    of the pullback will begin to attract more buyers and increase the odds that the
    tide will turn.

- en: For those who prefer their data crammed into one graphic, I have also updated
    an annotated plot in which the y-axis captures the magnitude of the peak-to-trough
    decline (inverted) and the x-axis records the duration of that move. I have also
    included the peak VIX during the pullback as a red label for each dot and a long
    dotted black line as the best linear fit of all the data points.

- en: Note that the current pullback is already the fifth longest in four plus years
    and while it has made quite a splash so far, there is only a 3.87 point cushion
    from today’s close to the intraday low before the pullback officially becomes
    longer in the tooth and more severe.
