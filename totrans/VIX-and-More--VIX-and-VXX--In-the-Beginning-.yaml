    I asked readers for their thoughts on what to cover in what I anticipated would
    be a big kitchen sink post about the iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN
    ([VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX).)

    realized that the scope of interest in and confusion about this product is sufficient
    to warrant a multi-part series. The more I thought about the broad spectrum of
    knowledge and lack of knowledge pertaining to VXX, the more I realized that it
    makes sense to start at the beginning to give investors of all experience levels
    as well as recent additions to the blog readership an opportunity to approach
    the subject with the same foundation of knowledge and context.

    with the most basic question of all: what is the VIX?'

- en: The VIX, whose formal name is the CBOE Volatility Index, is a calculation made
    by the CBOE of market expectations of 30-day implied volatility for S&P 500 index
    options. The CBOE calculates and disseminates VIX values every 15 seconds during
    the *index* trading day, which runs from 9:30 a.m. to 4:**15** p.m. Eastern Time.
    In other words, the VIX is calculated during the normal NYSE trading day, plus
    15 minutes after the close of normal trading.

    the VIX is calculated.

- en: The intent of the graphic is to demonstrate that out of the universe of all
    traded stocks, the VIX is concerned only with the stocks which comprise the S&P
    500 index, also known by its ticker symbol, SPX. The S&P 500 index is maintained
    by an index committee (more details [here](http://www.standardandpoors.com/indices/sp-500/en/us/?indexId=spusa-500-usduf--p-us-l--)),
    with periodic changes to the index constituents. The VIX is calculated using near
    term SPX options (typically the first two months) and a wide range of strikes
    (see the [CBOE’s VIX white paper](http://www.cboe.com/micro/vix/vixwhite.pdf)
    for details on the calculation methodology) and essentially reflects the implied
    volatility of those options used in the calculations.

    for the next 30 days, stated in annualized terms. See [Rule of 16 and VIX of 40](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/05/rule-of-16-and-vix-of-40.html)
    for a better sense of how standard deviations are factored into the VIX and how
    to interpret the VIX in terms of standard deviations.

    to do so, we will have to become familiar with [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures)
    as well.
