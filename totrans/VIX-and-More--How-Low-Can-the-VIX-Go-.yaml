    and the [April employment report](http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm)
    out of the way, volatility is cratering and the VIX is down to 31.45 as I type
    this.

- en: A little more than two weeks ago, in [The New VIX Macro Cycle Picture](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/04/new-vix-macro-cycle-picture.html),
    I suggested that for the current bull leg, 30 was a good guess for a VIX floor.
    That prediction was part art and part science, to be sure, but there were quite
    a few technical factors that went into the calculation.

- en: You don’t need a fancy model, however, to make a ballpark prediction for the
    VIX. I will share a quick and dirty back of the envelope calculation. Since the
    VIX averages approximately 1.3x the [historical volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/historical%20volatility)
    of the SPX, one can use the 10, 20 and 100 day historical volatility data to come
    up with three estimates of the VIX. Generally, I take the lowest one as a floor
    and average the two readings that are closest together to come up with an expectation
    of an appropriate current level of the VIX.

    yields a 31.33 VIX. For the 20 day HV, the numbers are 29.95 and 38.93\. The 100
    day HV, which includes SPX data going back to December 12^(th), is 37.52, with
    a 1.3x multiplier yielding 48.77.

    low is 31.39) and an appropriate current VIX of 35.13.

    will bear a reasonable resemblance to recent history. Still, they support the
    contention that we are nearing a VIX floor.

- en: For the record, the lowest 10, 20 or 100 day historical volatility level recorded
    in the past six months was a 10 day HV of 20.38, which translates into a VIX of
    26.69\. For anyone looking for the lowest possible extreme in the VIX in the near
    future, 26 would be a good bet. This is also consistent with my [earlier prediction](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/04/new-vix-macro-cycle-picture.html)
    that the VIX is not likely to breach a floor of 25-27.
