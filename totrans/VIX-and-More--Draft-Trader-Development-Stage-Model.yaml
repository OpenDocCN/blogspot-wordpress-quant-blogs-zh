- en: One of the under appreciated joys of blogging is the wide variety of people
    who you end up corresponding with across the globe – and whose paths would likely
    never have intersected my own had it not been for the blog.

    heads of other traders, what issues they struggle with and how they do – or sometimes
    don't – overcome obstacles to success.

- en: I have enough anecdotal evidence that suggests there is something of a typical
    development path that many retail traders follow as they grow and develop as traders.
    In an effort to start a dialogue about this and to give the blog a framework to
    refer back to in future posts, I thought I would post a draft of the mental model
    that is forming in my head.

    out there, I would be interested to hear about it.

    Once the basics have been debated and reformed, then it is a lot easier to add
    in some of the complexity.

- en: So…without further ado, I have appended below the first draft of the [trader
    development stage model](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/trader%20development%20stage%20model),
    which is hopefully relatively self-explanatory. Note that the vertical gray arrows
    are supposed to represent tension between related issues (leverage vs. position
    sizing, minimizing losers while maximizing winners, developing an edge vs. diversification.)
    Also, while I consider all the issues to be iterative, I suggest that the iteration
    process in the third stage is continuous.
