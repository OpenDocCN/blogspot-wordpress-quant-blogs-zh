# Humble Student of the Markets: A possible pause in the uptrend

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2016/04/a-possible-pause-in-uptrend.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2016/04/a-possible-pause-in-uptrend.html#0001-01-01)

**Mid-week market update:**

 Let me make myself absolutely clear, I remain intermediate term bullish on US equities based on the points I made in past remarks (see

[Equities in a macro sweet spot](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/04/10/equities-in-a-macro-sweet-spot/)

and

[The trend is your friend (breadth, seasonality and sentiment too)](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/04/03/the-trend-is-your-friend-breadth-seasonality-and-sentiment-too/)

). As the SPX struggles with a technical resistance level at about 2080, there are signs that the market may be due for a temporary pause in the uptrend for the following reasons:

*   Negative divergence in breadth and momentum indicators
*   Price mean reversion in a post option-expiry (OpEx) week 

This is purely a tactical trading call with a time horizon of 1-2 weeks.
