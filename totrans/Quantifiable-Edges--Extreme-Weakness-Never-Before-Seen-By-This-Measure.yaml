- en: The McClellan Oscillator uses advance/decline data to calculate the strength
    or weakness of a move from a breadth standpoint. The value will vary from provider
    to provider as there are often slight differences in advance/decline data. Worden
    Bros. is one data provider I use. Their measure of the McClellan Oscillator hit
    -381.49 on Wednesday. This is the lowest reading since they began tracking advance/decline
    data in 1986\. (Others I look at are low but not quite all-time lows.) Below is
    a chart of the McClellan Oscillator over the entire data period.

- en: One notable about this chart is that breadth readings have become more extreme
    over time. Whereas moves above 100 and below -100 were rare from ’86 – ’93, they
    are fairly ordinary today.
