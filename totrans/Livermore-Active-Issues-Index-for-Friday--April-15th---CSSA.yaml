- en: hi john, i think that i would have to say that i am somewhat satisfied with
    performance to the extent that any reasonable alpha in the large cap space for
    a low turnover strategy over a long time frame is an accomplishment. while our
    institutional models did considerably better, they too underperformed the backtests.
    I think that you hit the nail on the head when you suggested that correlations
    were responsible. This factor has hurt all cross-sectional momentum strategies,
    and no one was spared. However that said, like volatility in 2008, correlations
    also tend to mean-revert over time, and I expect that in a few years we will see
    a restoration of favorable conditions once again.
