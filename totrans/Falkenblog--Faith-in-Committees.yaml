    of commerce. A liberal thinks that governments can be more efficient if we set
    up top-down councils that issue wise edicts; a conservative thinks such committees
    will not issue any wise edicts [note, on social policies this is reversed, and
    here I side with the liberals]. I would admit most such councils are filled with
    people of good faith, but their task is futile, because they don't have the information
    to make such decisions, nor the incentives to make trade-offs implicit in any
    wise decisions.

    big committees on the 54th floor to get rid of waste. Unless there's a specific
    plan, which inevitably has winners and losers, such a committee is merely a refuge
    for grandstanding and a waste of bagels. All large government agencies (the Post
    Office, the Department of Defense, Education Boards) have 'best practices' committees,
    'effectiveness councils', with various other names. They all come to naught because
    the bottom line incentives are not conducive to cost cutting. They are fundamentally
    spending other people's money on other people, without any direct, strong incentive
    to do so efficiently. The incentive to cut costs gets lost in the context of fairness,
    justice, and coalition building.

    review', that has ever cut costs? A wise government council that has identified
    best practices more efficiently than a market? Government purchasers actually
    finding lower cost providers? Is there insufficient incentive to 'cut costs' currently,
    compared to the new system?
