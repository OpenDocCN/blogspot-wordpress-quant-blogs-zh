    the findings. We all like to comfort ourselves as truth-seekers above all else,
    unlike those idiots in the past who bought into some large belief structure that
    caused them to think, say, heavy objects fall faster than light objects, or that
    Africans were sub-human., but I think there are just as many taboo truths today
    as there have ever been. The issue concerns section 8 housing:'

- en: 'Betts had been evaluating the impact of one of the city government’s most ambitious
    initiatives: the demolition of the city’s public-housing projects, as part of
    a nationwide experiment to free the poor from the destructive effects of concentrated
    poverty. Memphis demolished its first project in 1997\. The city gave former residents
    federal “Section8” rent-subsidy vouchers and encouraged them to move out to new
    neighborhoods. Two more waves of demolition followed over the next nine years,
    dispersing tens of thousands of poor people into the wider metro community.'

  zh: 贝茨一直在评估该市政府最具雄心的倡议之一的影响：拆除该市的公共住房项目，作为一项旨在摆脱集中贫困破坏性影响的全国性实验的一部分。孟菲斯市在1997年拆除了其第一个项目。这座城市给予前居民联邦“Section8”租金补贴券，并鼓励他们搬到新的社区。在接下来的九年里，又发生了两次拆迁潮，将数以万计的贫困人口分散到更广泛的都市社区。

    are even more so. Getting addresses of Section 8 holders is difficult, because
    the departments want to protect the residents’ privacy. ... Janikowski merged
    his computer map of crime patterns with Betts’s map of Section8 rentals....the
    match was near-perfect...She knew right away that this would be a “hard thing
    to say or write.” Nobody in the antipoverty community and nobody in city leadership
    was going to welcome the news that the noble experiment that they’d been engaged
    in for the past decade had been bringing the city down, in ways they’d never expected.

    反贫困社区中没有人，城市领导中没有人会欢迎这样一个消息：他们过去十年参与的这项崇高实验，以未曾预料到的方式将该市拖垮。
- en: The idea began with Lyndon Johnson's Kaiser Commission on Urban Housing, which
    mistakenly believed that the private housing market created poverty, and the ills
    associated with it, by making housing too expensive. Thus, by reducing housing
    expenses via vouchers, and spreading the poor around the community, poverty, and
    the social ills associated with it, would fade away. That's the theory. It turns
    out, the main problem of poor people is not a lack of money, but the temperance,
    diligence, thrift and other bourgeois virtues needed to be good citizens and neighbors.
    They bring their bad habits with them, statistically.

  zh: 这个想法始于林登·约翰逊的凯撒城市住房委员会，他错误地认为市场创造了贫困，以及与之相关的社会问题，通过使住房变得太昂贵。因此，通过提供补贴券减少住房开支，并将贫困人口分散到社区中，贫困和与之相关的社会问题将消失。那是理论。事实证明，贫穷人的主要问题不是缺少钱，而是需要做一个好公民和邻居所需的节制、勤奋、节俭和其他资产阶级美德。他们带着他们的坏习惯来到这里，统计上来看。
- en: Given that it took 40 years to document this, this means that any big policy
    started today, will probably not be amenable to empirical analysis in my lifetime.
    Less than the 70 years of communism in the Soviet Union, but same scale. That's
    the big risk to big top-down ideas.

- en: But the insidiousness comes from the way the government, from federal down to
    city level, hid this data for decades because they didn't want people to discriminate
    against section 8 areas or their residents. This means, if they put a high concentration
    of people with high criminality next to your house, they didn't want you to know,
    based on the assumption that the poor's behavior was either due to a lack of housing
    (which section 8 addresses directly), or the 'stereotype effect' from people who
    see them as poor. But the theory was wrong, and so all those millions of people
    had to deal with this problem themselves, and if they asked questions in local
    papers, they were labeled racist, or anti-poor. I have seen this happen several
    times in communities I have lived in, where someone writes in an editorial or
    letter to the editor, noting that but for the residents from this part of town--where
    the section 8 housing is--school scores or crime in the city is pretty low. An
    onslaught of recriminations invariable ensues, and because of the difficulty in
    getting data, even though the author is saying what we all know to be true, he
    can not prove it, and so the public debate leaves him labeled 'racist', the modern
    day equivalent of being called a witch).

  zh: 但这种阴险性是因为从联邦到市级政府，他们几十年来都隐藏这些数据，因为他们不想让人们歧视第八区或其居民。这意味着，如果他们把高罪行率人口集中在你家附近，他们不想让你知道，认为穷人的行为要么是由于住房不足（第八区直接解决），要么是由于看他们穷的人的『陈规效应』。但理论是错误的，于是那数以百万计的人们不得不自己解决这个问题，如果他们在地方报纸上问问题，他们会被贴上种族主义者或反穷人的标签。我在我居住过的社区里看过这种情况发生了好几次，有人在文章或给编辑的信中指出，除了这个城区居民（那里有第八区住房），学校的分数或城市的犯罪率都很低。接下来必然会有一系列的指责，因为在获取数据方面的困难，尽管作者说的是我们都知道的事实，但他不能证明它，所以公共辩论让他被贴上『种族主义者』的标签，现代相当于被称为女巫的事）。
- en: 'When we give the government the power to solve big problems, like poverty,
    or crime, and introduce some grand policy, the best approach is prudent incrementalism:
    make a variety of changes piecemeal, monitor them, share the experiences with
    the rest of the world, learn and modify. This is the balance between conservatism
    and progressivism that makes societies better. But the standard operating procedure
    of governments is to implement a policy in one big swoop, and then hide the data
    so no one can criticize it. If a business acted this way, it would be destroyed
    and pilloried. This is one of several reasons why I think minimizing the scope
    of government''s function in society is a good thing, because government is not
    only inefficient, but it rationalizes dishonesty out of some greater good much
    more efficiently than any corporation can.'

  zh: 当我们给政府解决贫困或犯罪等重大问题的权力，并引入某些大政策时，最好的方法是谨慎的渐进主义：逐步进行各种变革，监测它们，与世界其他地方分享经验，学习并修改。这是保守主义和进步主义之间的平衡，使社会变得更好。但政府的标准作业程序是一次性实施政策，然后隐藏数据，以便没有人能批评它。如果一家企业这样做，它会被摧毁和抨击。这是我认为限制政府在社会中的功能范围是件好事的理由之一，因为政府不仅效率低下，而且它比任何公司都更有效地让不诚实的行为合理化，以追求某种更大的利益。
