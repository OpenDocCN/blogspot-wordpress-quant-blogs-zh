- en: Signs of technical deteriorations had been appearing last week, but NVIDIA’s
    earnings report saved the day. The earnings report can best be described as a
    blowout. The results beat Street expectations on all metrics and the company guided
    upwards. There wasn’t anything not to dislike about the report. As a consequence,
    the Semiconductor Index, which is a bellwether for artificial intelligence (AI)
    related plays, rallied strongly after briefly testing the lower bound of its absolute
    and relative return rising channels.

    has far more room to run before it reaches the phase of Magnificent Exuberance
    (see [Why this AI bull is nothing like the NASDAQ in 2000](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2024/02/11/why-this-ai-bull-is-nothing-like-nasdaq-in-2000/)).
