    “NAFIS Latency Panel: Stop and Think Before Spending on Speed” captures an important
    point around any architecture discussion.  The latency curve, depending on the
    business area you are in, could range from microseconds to seconds, or more. 
    When designing an architecture, consideration needs to occur for what the goal
    is with regards to end to end latency, component latency, and also the latency
    around failure conditions.  Singleton’s will definitely up-tick latency in a failure
    condition.  Food for thought.'
