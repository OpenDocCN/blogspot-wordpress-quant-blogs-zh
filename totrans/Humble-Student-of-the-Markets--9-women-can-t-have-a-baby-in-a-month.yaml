    or digital adoption narratives. Breakthroughs in medicine, in electronic networks,
    and in other intellectual achievement distribute more easily upon existing systems.
    ***This is why I continue to believe that many (not all) in Cleantech Venture
    dont’ really understand the scale of our energy problem***. Or, having understood
    the scale of our energy problem, many apply adoption pathways learned from other
    systems–that simply don’t translate to energy, and the built environment.

    of time and scale of the process is enormous. Gregor Macdonald went on to a chart
    that shows how long it to nuclear to reach levels of electrical generation by
    hydro.
