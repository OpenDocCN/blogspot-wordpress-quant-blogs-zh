    he created a bunch of nonsense in abstruse mathematics just to highlight what
    fools they are. Here''s his description of this work in Antifragile:'

    to have fun, I invited my friend Raphael Douady to collaborate in expressing this
    simple idea using the most opaque mathematical derivations, with incomprehensible
    theorems that would take half a day (for a professional) to understand ... Remarkably—as
    has been shown—if you can say something straightforward in a complicated manner
    with complex theorems, even if there is no large gain in rigor from these complicated
    equations, people take the idea very seriously. We got nothing but positive reactions,
    and we were now told that this simple detection heuristic was “intelligent” (by
    the same people who had found it trivial).

    totally meaningless. He basically defines anti-fragility as the difference between
    the expected value of a function and a function of an expected value over some
    arbitrary range of that function, and notes that nonlinear functions are more
    volatile than linear functions, and you want to be long convex payouts.

    risk, just mentions some really simple examples (stress tests for where unemployment
    is 8% and 9% that are typical guesses of macro) that highlight how losses can
    increase exponentially for different assumptions. For complex systems like large
    corporations, assessing the effect of macro inputs is a similarly vague exercise
    if you've ever been witness to them (to get a sense, ask yourself what your net
    worth would be if GDP fell by 5% or 10%).

    but this supposedly dominates this same test as well as everything else. Further,
    it does require density functions for the inputs, and functional forms, subjective
    thresholds, which for anything like a corporation is simply not amenable to such
    precision; for specific assets or portfolios there are more direct tools (eg,
    in options, kurtosis, twist, rho). Like so many things he says, this is

- en: By admitting that his models are merely "expressing [a] simple idea using the
    most opaque mathematical derivations, with incomprehensible theorems that would
    take half a day (for a professional) to understand", he's admitting his math does
    not add, it's merely to impress via excessive abstruseness. Surely many academics
    have created excessively technical articles reluctantly, but this shows real bad
    faith on his part, because presumably this journal aspires to apply rigor in pursuit
    of making ideas as clear as possible, not the opposite. I must admit it's kind
    of funny, but perhaps too mean.
