    it seems as if the entire [VIX exchange-traded product](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20ETN)
    (ETP) space has a large number of new converts. Growing from just two products
    at the end of 2009 ([VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX) and
    [VXZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXZ)) to 12 by the end of 2010
    and 31 by the end of 2011, VIX ETPs are a growth industry.

    – a field guide of sorts – might be of assistance. The intent of the graphic is
    to differentiate between the various VIX and volatility-based ETPs primarily by
    mapping them according to target duration and leverage. The key at the bottom
    of the graphic highlights some additional distinctions, such as:'

    the chart, but one I did incorporate was to flag [VIX ETFs](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20ETF)
    (from ProShares) in a black font, while all the ETNs are in a blue font.

    that were closed last year. Interestingly, both were immediately succeeded with
    virtually identical products that trade under a similar ticker.

    to capture the same level of detail as I have done in this single page, but for
    now at least, this is my reference of choice for VIX ETPs.
