    Payroll release. The last two NFP numbers have been below expectations. Looking
    ahead to Friday, however, I think that it is likely to come in either in-line
    or slightly above consensus expectations for a couple of reasons.

    large. In the last two months, I would have taken the "under" expectations bet
    if someone put a gun to my head and forced me to make a forecast. This month,
    I am taking the "over" because I am expecting a slight beat (by 10K or less).

    But will this kind of good news be actually positive for stocks? An employment
    number that slightly beats expectations, which would be my forecast, would not
    be positive enough to significantly light a rocket under the growth outlook, but
    would be positive enough to keep the Fed from engaging in quantitative easing
    for the June FOMC meeting. After the June meeting, the Fed will not have the political
    cover for QE for the rest of 2012 because of the election, unless the economy
    really craters. I agree with Tim Duy in his post

    to ease. And while some are pointing to falling TIPS-derived inflation as given
    the Fed room to move, they have traditionally delayed until conditions are more
    dire (they are not exactly prone to overshooting in the first place). The Fed
    doesn''t think they will ease further; they think their next move will be to tighten.
    ***Which means that financial conditions will need to deteriorate dramatically
    to prompt action in June. So if you are looking for the Fed to ease in just four
    weeks, you are looking for financial markets to turn very, very ugly. Lehman ugly.***
    And I wish that I could say that it won''t happen, but European policymakers are
    hell-bent to push their economies to the wall while worshipping at the alter of
    moral hazard.'
