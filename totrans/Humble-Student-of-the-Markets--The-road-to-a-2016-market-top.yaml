    based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. In essence, it seeks
    to answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish)
    or contraction (bearish)?"

    tops are processes. The purpose of this post to outline the process of how the
    US equity market is likely to top out in 2016\. I don't mean to convey the impression
    that I believe that equities go down right away. In fact, there is likely some
    upside left before the market makes its ultimate top before turning down. Let
    me explain.
