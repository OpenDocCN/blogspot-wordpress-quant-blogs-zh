    to various asset bubbles such as the internet bubble, the recent housing bubble,

- en: Malkiel and Shliefer once took opposite sides of the market efficiency debate
    in the Wall Street Journal. Dutch and Royal Shell trade on two separate exchanges.
    These different listings by law apportion a 60:40 split of cash flows and thus
    should trade as such, but indeed they vary by as much as 30% from this fundamental
    equivalence. Shleifer calls this a ‘fantastic embarrassment’ to the efficient
    markets hypothesis, yet Malkiel also notes it as being within his bands of reasonableness.
    To me, this highlights that much of this debate gets into semantics, and such
    debates are rarely fruitful (Wall Street Journal, 12/28/00).

  zh: 马尔基尔和施莱弗曾在华尔街日报上就市场效率问题持相反观点。荷兰皇家壳牌公司在两个不同的交易所上市。根据法律规定，这些不同的上市安排将现金流按60:40的比例分配，因此它们应该按此交易，但实际上它们与这种基本等价性相差高达30%。施莱弗称这是对有效市场假说的“极大尴尬”，而马尔基尔也认为这在他的合理范围内。对我来说，这凸显了这场辩论很大程度上涉及语义问题，而此类辩论往往收效甚微（华尔街日报，2000年12月28日）。
- en: To assert markets are irrational or inefficient, however, one needs to propose
    a measure of 'true value', and then show that actual market prices diverge from
    this. As classically worded by economists, any test of market efficiency is a
    joint test of a market model and the concept of efficiency. Thus, your test may
    merely be rejecting your market model, not efficiency. You may think this is unfair,
    but it's simple logic, and you have to deal with it. It is essential to have a
    specific alternative, because how do you know they are wrong unless you know the
    right answer? With hindsight, prices that were once really high, now not, were
    'wrong', but one has to be able to go back in time and show the then-consensus
    was obviously wrong. Thus, if you propose, say, some metric of P/E, or dividend
    payout ratios, that is fine, but then presumably there will be some range of P/Es
    that, when breached, generate inevitable mean-reversion thus demonstrating the
    correctness of the P/E ratio. Actual arbitrage, in the form of strategies that
    generate attractive Sharpe ratios, are necessary, and this is very hard to do.

  zh: 然而，要断言市场是非理性的或无效的，需要提出一个“真实价值”的衡量标准，并证明实际市场价格与此背离。正如经济学家经典表述的那样，任何市场效率的测试都是对市场模型和效率概念的联合测试。因此，你的测试可能仅仅是在拒绝你的市场模型，而非效率。你可能会认为这不公平，但这是简单的逻辑，你必须面对它。拥有一个具体的替代方案至关重要，因为如果你不知道正确答案，你怎么知道他们是错的呢？事后看来，曾经非常高的价格，现在不再高，是“错误的”，但你必须能够回到过去，并证明当时的共识显然是错误的。因此，如果你提出某种市盈率或股息支付率的指标，那很好，但显然会有一个市盈率范围，一旦突破，就会产生不可避免的均值回归，从而证明市盈率的正确性。实际的套利，以产生有吸引力的夏普比率的策略形式，是必要的，而这非常难以做到。

    one received in the Mexican Peso for decades, was erased in a single day in 1977
    when the Peso was devalued by about 45%. In 1982 Mexico did it again. Thus, decades
    of seemingly higher returns could have merely been the expected probability and
    size of these devaluations. As these probabilities are small, they are often not
    seen ''in sample'', and the standard errors on these probabilities are sufficiently
    high that it is very difficult to see if they are sufficient to explain, or even
    over-explain, a certain return premium. That is, when you have a 1% or 5% chance,
    annually, of a 75% depreciation, the appropriate offset is 0.75% or 3.75%, a big

  zh: 无论如何，它最初应用于这样一个事实：几十年来，墨西哥比索的高利率在1977年的一天内被抹去，当时比索贬值了约45%。1982年墨西哥再次这样做。因此，几十年来看似更高的回报可能仅仅是这些贬值的预期概率和规模。由于这些概率很小，它们通常不会在样本内“被观察到”，并且这些概率的标准误差足够高，以至于很难判断它们是否足以解释，甚至过度解释某个特定的回报溢价。也就是说，当你有1%或5%的年概率，75%的贬值，适当的抵消是0.75%或3.75%，这是一个很大的差异。

- en: Such events are not proof against efficient or rational markets, but rather,
    supports it, because estimating the probabilities of these important events is
    clearly very difficult. A rational market should move a lot as people change their
    estimation that, say, the next Microsoft is extant in a set of internet stocks
    (with potential future market cap of $200B), or that a worldwide Depression is
    likely. The Peso Problem literature goes back to the 1980's at least, and fits
    within the rational market approach as one of the main reasons things that appear
    anomalous actually are rational. If you think extreme events invalidate rational
    markets, this implies one has a lot of certainty for the magnitude and probability
    of highly improbable events, which is not very compelling (eg, what is the probability
    of a second leg in the current financial crisis? 1%? 10%? 50%?).

    can’t market participants also be considered rational and yet have their collective
