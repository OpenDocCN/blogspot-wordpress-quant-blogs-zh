    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    signal. A bullish Trend Model signal that gets less bullish is a trading "sell"
    signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading
    "buy" signal. The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of
    the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. Past trading of
    the trading model has shown turnover rates of about 200% per month.

    200 day moving average (dma), and oversold on a number of key metrics. Traders
    are treating next week's US election as the same kind of market moving event as
    the Brexit referendum. There is one key difference. The market was relatively
    sanguine going into the UK vote and expected a favorable outcome. By contrast,
    the market is positioning for a bearish outcome, even though the polls show that
    the bullish scenario, namely a Clinton win, as the more likelyt scenario.
