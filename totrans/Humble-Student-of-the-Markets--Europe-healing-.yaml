    the eurozone, which is mired in deep recession and possibly a multi-year depression.

    is clearly struggling and Germany’s growth has been slower than many had hoped
    – due primarily to global economic weakness. But take a look at the rest of the
    Eurozone. While still in contraction mode, it shows an improving trend.

    may be a signal to rethink how valid some of these forecasts really are. Nobody
    is suggesting we will see Spain or Portugal all of a sudden begin to grow at 5%.
    But given the extremely pessimistic sentiment of many economists (a contrarian
    indicator), it is highly possible we are at or near the bottom of the cycle. People
    should not be surprised if we start seeing some positive growth indicators – especially
    in the periphery nations – in the next few quarters.

- en: After several days of roadshowing, the troubled Slovenia decided to open books
    for 5 and 10y bonds on Tuesday (30 April). Given that in the previous weeks peripheral
    bond markets rallied like mad, it wasn’t too heroic to assume that the book-building
    would be quite quick. Indeed, in the early afternoon books exceeded USD10bn (I
    guess Slovenia wanted to sell something around 2-3bn) and then reached a quarter
    of what Apple managed to get in its book building. If I were to take a cheap shot
    I would say that Slovenia’s GDP is almost 10 times smaller than Apple’s market
    capitalisation* but I won’t.

    downgrade, which has led to a subsequent suspension of the whole issuance process.
    I honesty can’t recall the last time a rating agency would do such a thing after
    the roadshow and during book-building but that’s beside the point. That evening,
    Moody’s (which already was the most bearish agency on Slovenia) downgraded the
    country by two notches to junk AND maintained the negative outlook. This created
    a whopping four-notch difference between them and both Fitch and S&P (A-). The
    justification of the decision was appalling. Particularly the point about “uncertain
    funding prospects”. I actually do understand why Moody’s did what it did – they
    must have assumed that the Dijsselbloem Rule (a.k.a. The Template) means that
    Slovenia will fall down at the first stumbling point. But they weren’t brave enough
    to put that in writing and instead chose a set of phony arguments.

    the first attempt and Slovenia sold 3.5bn worth of 5 and 10y bonds. On Friday,
    the new Sloven23s traded up by more than 4 points, which means yield fell by more
    than 50bp from the 6% the government paid. A fairy tale ending.
