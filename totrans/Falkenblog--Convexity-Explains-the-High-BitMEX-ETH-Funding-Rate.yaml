    and ether (ETH). The main reason it trades so much is that they are based outside
    of US or EU control in the little archipelago-nation of Seychelles, and also that
    it transacts only in Bitcoin. This combination makes it difficult for regulators
    to attack.

    price in 1 month is $110, in a swap this would show up as a 10% monthly funding

    to sentiment or simply a market imbalance. Yet there's a futures contract for
    the ETHBTC contract, and the basis there is quite small, about 5% annualized,
    which is inconsistent with this explanation. Further, ETH and BTC are highly correlated,
    about 90% using 2019 data, so it is implausible to think these two assets would
    have such radically different risk premia.

    the opposite return pattern to the BTC swap, where the USD return is convex, while
    the BTC return is linear. For example, if the ETH price rises 10% the BTC price
    will also probably rise, increasing returns for up movements. The same process
    works on downward movements to dampen losses. The result is the opposite of the
    BTC swap, a convex payoff in USD and a linear payoff in BTC.

    ETH USD return over that period: 51% vs. 115% (all data reflecting arithmetically
    annualized returns). Thus if the average ETH return is boosted by 60% via the

    an arithmetic return maintains a constant USD notional each period, one has to
    rebalance their position each period to generate the arithmetic return, so investors
    would need to adopt such an approach to generate the arithmetic return (see

    a position on the future move in ETH, but also the ETH~BTC covariance. I understand
    why it is so popular, as it is very difficult to put on such a position hassle-free
    anywhere else, yet BitMEX should offer something with a linear fiat payoff like
    their BTC swap, as I think this would be even more popular. This could be done
    by having the BTC notional contract trade on the BTCETH price; alternatively,
    they could add a BTC return adjustment to make the USD return linear. Either approach
    would remove the importance of estimating the covariance term, which is a distraction
    for most investors, and also one that few really understand.'
