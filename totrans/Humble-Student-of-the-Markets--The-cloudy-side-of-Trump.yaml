    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    signal. A bullish Trend Model signal that gets less bullish is a trading "sell"
    signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading
    "buy" signal. The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of
    the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. Past trading of
    the trading model has shown turnover rates of about 200% per month.

    is that Trump appoints sensible people, matures in office, and puts most of his
    considerable energy into the pro-growth parts of his agenda. The negative scenario
    is that he goes back to being the inciter who flew off the Twitter handle so much
    during the campaign that his people temporarily seized control of his account.

    have run ahead of themselves and a corrective period is likely. The bigger question
