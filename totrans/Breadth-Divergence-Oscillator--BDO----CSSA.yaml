    ideas. In my case I am looking for concepts or theories to use to build indicators
    or statistical models. One post particularly caught my eye because it inspired
    exactly that kind of idea : [http://blog.afraidtotrade.com/may-2008-the-last-time-we-saw-major-breadth-divergences-like-this/](http://blog.afraidtotrade.com/may-2008-the-last-time-we-saw-major-breadth-divergences-like-this/) 
    Corey Rosenbloom is a well-known technical analyst and trader who provides  market
    analysis and often gives a theoretical explanations for his interpretation. It
    is this kind of analysis that is completely distinct from the vague and untestable
    technical analysis of the past. This kind of analysis can be molded into an experiment,
    or in this case into a technical indicator.'

    (ie advancers or advancers vs decliners) are deteriorating, this should be negative
    for the market on the premise that there is very little broad-based interest in
    the recent move. The reverse applies when markets are falling but market internals
    are improving which should be bullish for the market. Looking at Corey’s post,
    the first thing that struck me was that he drew a line……..implying that we should
    be looking at the “slope” of advancers or advancers vs decliners, and also the
    “slope” of market prices. This immediately spawned the idea for the BDO- I could
    easily measure this effect using a technical indicator.  The BDO is a direct measurement
    of the scaled differences between these two slopes. In this case after performing
    some normalization procedures, I looked at the slope of my own little advance
    decline line over the last 10 days vs the slope of the market. Readings below
    .3  show the classic bearish divergence, while readings above .7 show classic
    bullish divergence. How did this simple indicator perform? It was remarkably consistent
    over the last 40 years, which demonstrates the durability of good concepts–something
    I have tried to emphasize many times. Lets take a quick look:'

    in the edge over the last 3000 bars versus the last 9000\. The market makes no
    progress when BDO is less than .3, and the returns tend to be more slightly more
    erratic. In contrast, the market makes strong returns (note buy and hold made
    .97% over the last 3000 bars, and 7% over the last 9000) when the BDO is greater
    than .7\. Using other indicators in conjunction with the BDO make the results
    much better, but that is a topic for a separate post.
