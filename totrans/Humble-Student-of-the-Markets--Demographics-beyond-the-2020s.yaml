    picture for the labor market is on a collision course with a dimming demographic
    outlook. While jobs are growing faster than expected, population is growing more
    slowly. In July of last year, the U.S. population stood at 327 million, 2.1 million
    fewer than the Census Bureau predicted in 2014 and 7.8 million fewer than it predicted
    in 2008\. (Figures for 2019 will be released at the end of the month.)

    to lower, while trending flat to higher in other countries. Last year, the foreign-born
    population expanded by a historically low 200,000, according to the Census Bureau.
    The exact reasons are unclear. The illegal immigrant population had stopped growing
    before President Trump took office. Legal immigration remained above 1 million
    through 2018.
