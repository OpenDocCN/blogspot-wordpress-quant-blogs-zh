    most recently in [China About to Break Out?](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/12/china-about-to-break-out.html)
    Now that Chinese stocks ([FXI](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/FXI),
    black line) appear to be on the rebound, an important question is whether this
    is an isolated phenomenon or one that will also affect other [emerging markets](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/emerging%20markets)
    economies.

    the recent bounce in emerging market stocks ([EEM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EEM),
    orange line). It is the other three members of the [BRIC](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/BRIC)
    group, however, that are lagging China and the broad emerging markets group the
    most. Not surprisingly, commodity-rich Russia ([RSX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/RSX),
    blue line) is the biggest laggard among the BRIC countries, while India ([EPI](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EPI))
    and Brazil ([EWZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EWZ)) are trailing
    the broader emerging markets index, but performing better than Russia.

- en: The question of whether growing domestic demand and a massive government stimulus
    package will result in a China-specific rebound or help pull other global economies
    along for the ride is not likely to be answered soon. In the meantime, China looks
    strong on a relative basis and other emerging economies should be watched closely
    for clues about the geographical breadth of the rally.
