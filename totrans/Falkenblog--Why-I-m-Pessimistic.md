# Falkenblog: Why I'm Pessimistic

Last month, a big deal was made about a deal to raise the debt ceiling, which involved a major concession by Obama: $917 billion in spending cuts over 10 years. A special committee of lawmakers would be charged with finding another $1.5 trillion in deficit reduction, which could come through a tax overhaul and changes to safety-net programs. That included only

$22B

in fiscal 2012.

Tonight, Obama just added about

$100B

in spending for FY2012, as well as tax cuts and more spending in future years. Next time there's a debt ceiling stalemate, Obama should promise to cut spending by $10 trillion in future decades.
