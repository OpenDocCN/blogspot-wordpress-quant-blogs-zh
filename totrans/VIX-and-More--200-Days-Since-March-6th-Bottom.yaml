    trading days since the March 6^(th) bottom.

    average](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/200%20day%20SMA), these averages
    are going to start to accelerate their already rapid upward move, as old lows
    begin to scroll off of the lookback window. In order to show how quickly the 200
    day MA is moving, two months ago the S&P 500 index was just about exactly where
    it is now. At the time, the index was more than 20% above its 200 day MA of about
    909, which I took as a signal that equities were getting overheated. Fast forward
    two months and with the SPX at the same level, the index is now only 13% above
    the 200 day MA, which is currently at 969 and is advancing at a rate of more than
    two points per day.

    levels are rising. Bears will undoubtedly see any sort of convergence with the
    200 day MA level as a sign that the distance to a bear market is decreasing. For
    now I am in the bull camp, but an extended range-bound drift is starting to look
    increasingly likely.
