- en: Among other things, this means that for those who watch the [200 day moving
    average](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/200%20day%20SMA), these averages
    are going to start to accelerate their already rapid upward move, as old lows
    begin to scroll off of the lookback window. In order to show how quickly the 200
    day MA is moving, two months ago the S&P 500 index was just about exactly where
    it is now. At the time, the index was more than 20% above its 200 day MA of about
    909, which I took as a signal that equities were getting overheated. Fast forward
    two months and with the SPX at the same level, the index is now only 13% above
    the 200 day MA, which is currently at 969 and is advancing at a rate of more than
    two points per day.

  zh: 这意味着，对于那些关注[200天移动平均线](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/200%20day%20SMA)的人来说，这些平均线将开始加速它们已经迅速上升的趋势，因为旧低点开始从回望窗口中滚动出去。为了展示200天移动平均线移动有多快，两个月前标普500指数几乎就在现在这个位置。当时，指数比其200天移动平均线（约为909）高出20%以上，我认为这是股市过热的信号。快进两个月，标普500指数在同一水平，现在指数仅比200天移动平均线高出13%，当前的200天移动平均线为969，并且每天上升超过两点。
- en: Bulls will probably interpret a rising 200 day MA as an indication that support
    levels are rising. Bears will undoubtedly see any sort of convergence with the
    200 day MA level as a sign that the distance to a bear market is decreasing. For
    now I am in the bull camp, but an extended range-bound drift is starting to look
    increasingly likely.

  zh: 牛市可能会将上升的200天移动平均线解读为支撑位上升的迹象。无疑，熊市会看到与200天移动平均线水平的任何收敛作为距离熊市越来越近的信号。目前我站在牛市阵营，但是一个持续的横盘整理趋势开始变得越来越可能。
