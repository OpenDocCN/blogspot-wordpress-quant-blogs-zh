    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    near-term volatility. The first was the uncertainty of the FOMC decision. Approaching
    the meeting, the market was expecting three quarter-point rate cuts by year-end,
    with the first occurring in July. The Powell Fed delivered a dovish hold. The
    bond market reacted with a bull steepening, and stock prices soared.

    in Osaka. In the wake of the Fed decision, the ensuing equity market euphoria
    is seemingly discounting a successful conclusion to the trade talks. Our trade
    war factor, which is measured by the relative performance of an ETF of Russell
    1000 stocks with pure domestic revenues, is indicating a dramatic decline in trade
    tensions.
