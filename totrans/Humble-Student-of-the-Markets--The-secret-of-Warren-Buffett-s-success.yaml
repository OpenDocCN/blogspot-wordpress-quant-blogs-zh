- en: Years ago I was asked what kept us from being Warren Buffett. My reply was "how
    Buffett picked stocks was fairly well-known. The problem was the inability of
    managers to tolerate excessive tracking error." This was quant-speak for "portfolio
    managers spent too much time building benchmark hugging portfolios for business
    reasons".

    businesses he doesn’t understand or he deems “too difficult to run”. As a result,
    the portfolio will contain very few companies in certain industries, such as Technology.
    As any good quant can tell you, a lot of return risk can be explained by industry
    weightings and such a lopsided portfolio will have returns that are very different
    from the S&P 500.

    which people have focused on for Buffett. It’s also about [benchmarking](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2008/01/what-do-you-do-after-youve-made-your.html),

    Indeed there is some evidence of that as this [study](http://worldbeta.blogspot.com/2008/06/sharpe-ratios-of-managers.html)
    shows that despite Berkshire's vaunted investment results, its Sharpe ratio is
    only 0.64.**

    consider the value of that cash flow stream at purchase time. Buffett et al seems
    to care less about the value of the company in the marketplace after its purchase.
    After all, the value of Berkshire Hathaway’s unlisted subsidiaries are not reported
    anywhere nor can they reported since there is no publicly listed value for these
    companies. After BRK acquires them, they only get valued by the market based of
    their aggregate cash flows, asset values, etc.**'

    (EVA), as popularized by Stern Stewart & Co? Under the EVA analytical framework,
    your objective in running a company is to make sure the returns on your investments
    are above the cost of your funding. Since Berkshire buys and doesn''t sell, its
    investment policy seems to be consistent with the concepts of EVA: buy cheaply
    and never mind what the market thinks in the interim because you are managing
    through the economic cycle.**'

- en: It can be done. I once worked with a taxable family trust that held an equity
    portfolio with many positions with very low cost basis (and therefore large capital
    gains liability if the position were to be sold). The objective of the trust was
    to provide its current beneficiaries with an income stream while preserving the
    inflation adjusted value of the capital for future generations.

- en: The trustees decided to focus the portfolio on holding dividend paying stocks
    with good growth prospects. They created a synthetic benchmark based on the dividend
    growth metrics to measure the portfolio’s performance. Returns were measured on
    an after-tax basis. The hurdle rate for selling a stock with an embedded capital
    gain therefore was higher than normal because of the higher after-tax cost of
    replacing the dividend stream.

    in the unusual situation of apologizing every time the market went up, even if
    the portfolio had outperformed: “Sorry, we made money for you this quarter (but
    that means that we can’t re-balance the portfolio and sell anything without taking
    the capital gains hit)”. Conversely, market declines were welcome because it afforded
    an opportunity to harvest some capital losses so that the portfolio could be re-balanced
    on a tax-efficient basis.'

- en: The story of this trust is an example of an investor knowing his objectives
    and sticking to them. In this case, the trust knew its objective and created its
    own benchmark. The trustees focused on dividends and their growth rates (just
    as Berkshire Hathaway focuses on cash flows and their growth). What the market
    pays for those investments in the interim was mostly noise that could be ignored.
