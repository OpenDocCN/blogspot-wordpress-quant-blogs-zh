    off from their parent has generated very good results.  Here's the performance
    of the Bloomberg Spin-Off index (

    a 6% for the S&P500 over that period. Volatility was higher but not extremely
    so (20% vs. 15%), while the beta was pretty close to 1.0.

    2000\. On average, subsidiaries outperformed their benchmark companies by over
    20% over the first three years following the spinoffs, with most of the excess
    returns within the first 12 months of trading. They found the parent company outperformed
    as well, but not by a robust amount.

    when they just spun off from Dunn &Bradstreet, it was really liberating. For years
    D&B had used the considerable Moody's cashflow to fund their dumb ideas to extend
    D&B, which really ran the executive board while Moody's made all the money.  It
    was a classic waste of shareholder money, and so when the spin-off finally happened
    in 2000, Moody's (MCO) stopped burning its cash and investors reaped the windfall
    (32% return, annualized, from 2000-present). It's amazing how much money is wasted
    via such politics, but it's a classic case of a bad incentives and difficult monitoring.

    force it to sell itself into pieces, I bet everyone with defensible interests
    would hit a home run.  Letting a $120B company underperform is really painful
    to behold. The only people such behemoths serve now are a select bunch of executives
    and politicians, not shareholders, consumers, or 99.99% of Citi employees.
