- en: Right now, all three indicators are outperforming the broad market indices,
    so I feel as if the rally is on good footing. My biggest concern coming into the
    day was that would be traders worried about Monday's headline risk, but the longer
    the indicators noted above continue to do well, the less pressure there will be
    on the system.

    as fear lingered in the face of a weekend of uncertainty, but for now, the fear
    component of the VIX seems to be slowly dissipating.
