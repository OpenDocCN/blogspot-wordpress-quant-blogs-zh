- en: Most bad business models will go on until the cash runs out. That's why cash
    flow is a useful predictor, because money losers keep losing money, and driving
    the stock down, until it goes to zero. Sort of like GM's strategy.

- en: (1) an institution will resist any change in its current direction; (2) Just
    as work expands to fill available time, corporate projects or acquisitions will
    materialize to soak up available funds; (3) Any business craving of the leader,
    however foolish, will be quickly supported by detailed rate-of-return and strategy
    studies prepared by his troops; and (4) The behavior of peer companies, whether
    they are expanding, acquiring, setting executive compensation or whatever, will
    be mindlessly imitated.
