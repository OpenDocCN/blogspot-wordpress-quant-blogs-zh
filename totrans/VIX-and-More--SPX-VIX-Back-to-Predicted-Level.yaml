- en: A week before the [February 27](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/February%2027)^(th)
    VIX spike, I talked about the [ratio of the SPX to the VIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/02/spxvix-relationship.html)
    and posited that the best way to think about that relationship would be to look
    at the oscillating VIX number in the context of a SPX that is trending approximately
    10% over the long term.

- en: The day after the February 27^(th) spike, I [revisited](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/02/relative-movements-of-spx-and-vix.html)
    the [SPX:VIX ratio](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SPX%3AVIX), which
    had dropped precipitously from 138 to 76 (on the [monthly chart](http://i104.photobucket.com/albums/m163/bl82/SPX-VIX022707.gif))
    and commented that I considered a ‘neutral range’ for this ratio to be in the
    area of 105-115.

- en: This seems like as good a time as any to update the SPX:VIX ratio, which rebounded
    all the way to 111 on the weekly chart (below) and now sits at 106.  In other
    words, the SPX:VIX ratio is now just about exactly at the midpoint between the
    extremes of pre-2/27 complacency and post-2/27 panic – and also very close to
    the long-term SPX trend line that reflects a 10% annual increase.

    at the moment, then it is perhaps because at the current levels, the battle is
    a draw.
