- en: When coding up an automated trading component for your etrading system, always
    give it a read only mode. Why ?  Because no matter how many automated tests, simulations
    and replays of live data you’ve done in your test environment, your code may still
    have failed to anticipate some anomaly in the live environment. And then you’ll
    find it trades in the wrong size, or at the wrong price, or on the wrong side
    etc…

    trades, but does log the trades it would have done, and the market environment
    at that time. Then get your sponsor on the desk to look through the log, review
    & sign off. And only then, take a deep breath and push the big red button…
