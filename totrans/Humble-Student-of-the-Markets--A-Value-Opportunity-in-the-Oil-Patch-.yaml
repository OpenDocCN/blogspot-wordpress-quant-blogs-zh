- en: on energy. Oil prices and energy equities have been in a long multi-year uptrend,
    aided and abetted by a softening US Dollar. If you believe that the long-term
    secular trend for this sector is still up, then there are some laggards that you
    could look at, such as real estate plays in the Oil Patch.

- en: The accompanying chart shows the indexed US$ values of the XLE (Energy Select
    SPDR ETF) and a couple of smaller cap Canadian property developers, Melcor Developments
    (MRD.TO) and Gendis Land Development (GDC.TO), both listed in Toronto. These are
    developers who are mainly focused in Alberta, the heart of the Canadian Oil Patch.
    While the XLE has been on a steady uptrend for the past year, the Canadian developers
    have been on a roller coaster ride. Over time, there is still good physical demand
    for property from wage and employment gains in that part of the country and property
    prices should move in line with the region’s underlying economy.

    to the US, albeit more muted. Lending standards did not get as wild as they did
    south of the border. The most aggressive lending products were zero-down mortgages
    and the worst of the US excesses such as no-doc and negative amortization loans
    did not migrate to Canada.

    In addition, the group does face a headwind from Canadian lenders starting to
    tighten up on lending standards which would restrain demand.
