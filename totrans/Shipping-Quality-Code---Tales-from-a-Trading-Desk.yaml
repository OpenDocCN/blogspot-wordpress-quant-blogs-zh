    and [Learning](http://blog.learningbyshipping.com/2014/09/25/beauty-of-testing/)
    by Shipping both offer good reads on shipping quality code.  Its also nice to
    see that [SAFe](http://scaledagileframework.com/code-quality/) also has view on
    code quality, and the importance of Test First.'

    and Acceptance-Test Driven Development (ATDD). Both are supported by Test Automation,
    which is required in support of Continuous Integration, team velocity, and development
    efficiency.

    employed, testing is one of those efforts where corners are cut.

- en: Its nice to see that Steven appropriately calls out “specification”.  All to
    often the concept of specification is lost in an agile project, leading to debate
    about a bug, and comments centred around “its obviously”.  Ambiguity exists unfortunately
    in all walks of life, and hence the need for a specification.  No specification,
    no bugs.

    with measurements. Yet routinely we in software build products or features without
    specifications.
