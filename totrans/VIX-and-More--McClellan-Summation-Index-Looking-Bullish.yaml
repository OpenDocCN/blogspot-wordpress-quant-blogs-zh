- en: A lot has been written about weakness in market breadth in the past week or
    so.  With storm clouds looming over advances and declines, new highs and new lows,
    volume, etc., one might conclude that the breadth story is uniformly negative.  Part
    of that interpretation depends upon whether you look at the ‘bad news’ in market
    breadth as confirmation of the breakdown in the broad market indices or whether
    you consider market breadth extremes to be contrarian indicators – at least in
    the short-term.

    term when it comes to highs and lows.  Short-termers may be partial to the [McClellan
    Oscillator](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/McClellan%20Oscillator);
    I am more interested in the [McClellan Summation Index](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/McClellan%20Summation%20Index).

- en: When I last posted about the McClellan Summation Index, it was October 25^(th)
    and I was concerned about [two technical aspects](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/10/two-thoughts-on-mcclellan-summation.html)
    of the index that I interpreted as bearish.  It certainly has been a bearish month
    since then, but now the index suggests that we are coming out of an extreme oversold
    condition that should provide a bullish foundation for at least the next few weeks…so
    I’m back on the bull side of the fence for now.
