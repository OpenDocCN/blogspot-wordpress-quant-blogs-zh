- en: One chart that did a superb job with put to call ratios and volatility was submitted
    by Greg Neal. Actually, this was not a single chart, per se, but more of a series
    of charts which tell a compelling story. Whereas Greg submitted his chart over
    the weekend, I have used updated data through today and have cut Greg’s chart
    to two sections to make for easier reading below. In terms of key takeaways, I’ll
    let the chart and Greg’s annotations speak for themselves.

  zh: 有一张利用看跌/看涨比率与波动性做得非常出色的图表是由Greg Neal提交的。实际上，这不仅仅是一张图表，而是一系列图表，它们讲述了一个引人入胜的故事。尽管Greg是在周末提交的他的图表，但我使用了今天最新的数据，并将Greg的图表缩减为两部分，以便于下面的阅读。关于关键收获，我让图表和Greg的注释自己来说明。
