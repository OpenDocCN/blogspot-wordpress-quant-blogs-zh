    week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week) contest
    and three subjects seemed to attract the most attention of chartists: [put to
    call ratios](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/put%20to%20call); volatility
    and [market breadth](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/breadth).'

- en: One chart that did a superb job with put to call ratios and volatility was submitted
    by Greg Neal. Actually, this was not a single chart, per se, but more of a series
    of charts which tell a compelling story. Whereas Greg submitted his chart over
    the weekend, I have used updated data through today and have cut Greg’s chart
    to two sections to make for easier reading below. In terms of key takeaways, I’ll
    let the chart and Greg’s annotations speak for themselves.
