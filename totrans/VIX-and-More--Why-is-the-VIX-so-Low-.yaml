    is at historical lows.

    investors are selling put and call options — ’selling volatility’ in Wall Street

    with Lahart’s analysis this morning in [www.SchaeffersResearch.com](http://www.schaeffersresearch.com/),
    arguing against both the low VIX theory and the likelihood that selling volatility
    is the cause.  Schaeffer cites the recent extremely tight trading range of the
    OEX as proof that the VIX can go much lower.  He also maintains that a large majority
    of the option activity in question has been initiated by buyers, not sellers.

    draws comparisons between the current VIX and the range-bound VIX of the early
    to mid-1990, suggesting that the 10-15 range may be the natural long-term range
    of the VIX.

    in this space, Jason Goepfert of [www.sentimentrader.com](http://www.sentimentrader.com/)
    has attempted to reconstruct the VIX going back all the way to 1900 and believes
    that the current VIX readings are not particularly low by the historical standards
    of the past century.

- en: Finally, in my [first entry](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/01/week-in-vix-january-7-2007-introduction.html)
    in this blog, I proposed that the VIX had moved in four macro cycles in the 14
    years since it first appeared, with a typical length of 3-5 years per cycle.  According
    to my analysis, the current cycle of decreasing volatility began in April 2002,
    so the five years will be up in another two months or so.

    and beyond, but I will do my best to use this blog to present the various theories
    of why the VIX is low and refine my own thinking as I go along.  In the meantime,
    I will continue to fade any [large spikes](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/01/what-to-expect-from-vix-spike.htmlhttp:/vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/01/what-to-expect-from-vix-spike.html)
