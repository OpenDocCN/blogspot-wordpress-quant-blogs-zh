    clients, and I bet if you visit Robeco in Rotterdam they''ll give you one for
    your plane ride home, which is more than enough time to read it (100 pages, lots
    of pictures).'

    the Florentine bankers prevented anything but Roman numerals as late as 1299,
    and the Medici's didn't adopt Arabic numerals until 1500.

- en: The Florentine bankers Bardi, Peruzzi, and Acciaiuoli, who prospered from 1300
    to 1340, left a lot of documentation about their business. The Medicis then dominated
    from 1397–1494, followed by the Fuggers, and then the Rothschilds from 1800-1900\.
    Interestingly, the Rothschild patriarch created the perfect family business, putting
    his five sons in key cities throughout Europe, allowing them to arbitrage the
    different exchange rates common to markets that are not fully integrated.

- en: Last year Bitcoin often traded at prices 5% higher in Korea, but it is difficult
    to move money in and out of Korea due to explicit laws. The only way to arb this
    requires a non-formal relationship with someone in Korea, like a brother. You
    then buy in the US while your brother sells there, settling when you meet for
    a holiday. That is, only an informal but trusted partnership can arbitrage geographic
    price disparities caused by legal restrictions because there are no explicit asset
    and liabilities, just an implicit agreement within a family.

    and then Amsterdam. As the Dutch East India company was the first traded stock
    (1602) and prospered throughout the 17th century, Amsterdam was well situated.
    Amsterdam also reduced the uncertainty caused by the many coins and their various
    levels of debasement by requiring every transaction above 600 guilders to go through
    the Bank of Amsterdam, which kept a 100% reserve ratio and cleaned up the system
    by melting down 'bad' coins.

- en: The English are fond of deprecating the Dutch--Dutch Uncle, courage, date--but
    they really owe the Dutch quite a bit. The financial center of Amsterdam literally
    moved to London around 1680, as when Dutch stadtholder William of Orange took
    over England via the Glorious Revolution in 1688, it gave them not only a Bill
    of Rights that limited monarchical power, it also created the Bank of England,
    tradable bonds, and an active London stock market. The start of the Industrial
    Revolution is often dated around 1750 centered in London, and surely it would
    have taken a lot longer without those innovations.

- en: 'There was a simple way to get around the Catholic prohibition on interest.
    The 14th-century Florentine bankers simply used different FX rates on contracts.
    As FX rates could fluctuate the bill was not considered a loan and so not usury.
    Explicit loans were also available, but they would have been more like ''payday''
    lending today, a business dominated by two outsider groups: Jews who could charge
    interest to non-Jews, and pawnbrokers nicknamed Lombards, whose name underlies
    the ''Lombard Streets'' found in many financial districts.'

    was perhaps the first international financial crisis, affected by the English
    default at the outbreak of the 100 years war. An IPO bubble crashed in 1696, destroying
    70% of the 140 companies traded in London. Then there's 1720, where the Mississippi
    Company saw its share price rise 20-fold only to end worthless, and in that year
    only 4 of the 190 new companies survived. The massive destruction in these early
    stock markets gives me hope in that I suspect that at least 70% of the new bitcoins
    and tokens are worthless, but as these prior crashes show, that level of worthlessness
    does not imply the worthlessness of the blockchains in general. Other crashes
    mentioned occurred in 1763, 1772, and 1825.
