    some €55bn a year. However, a study carried out by the Commission has found that
    the tax could also dent long-term economic growth in the region by between 0.53
    per cent and 1.76 per cent of gross domestic product.

- en: The article doesn't mention who did the study, or give a link to it. But there's
    worse. If reported accurately, it seems the European Commission's economists --
    or whoever they had do the study mentioned -- actually think that the "3" in 0.53
    and the "6" in 1.76 mean something. That's quite impressive accuracy when talking
    about economic growth. In a time of great uncertainty.

    their results would be, say, between 0 and 2 percent crudely, or maybe even -1
    and 3\. But that would be admitting that no one has any certainty about what's
    coming next, and that's not part of the usual practice.
