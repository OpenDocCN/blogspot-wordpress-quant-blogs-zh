    I toyed with several indicators that I thought might help me better separate fear
    from volatility.  I published a [10-day chart](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/08/fear-vs-volatility.html)
    of one of those, the VIX:SDS ratio.

    that the extreme reading of .633 it did an excellent job of flagging the recent
    market bottom.  I am still not sure how useful the VIX:SDS ratio may be going
    forward, but I thought a six month chart might be interesting analytical fodder
    for those who like to contemplate such matters.  As always, comments are welcome.
