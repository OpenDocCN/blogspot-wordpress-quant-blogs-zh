[Quebec pension fund](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20090130.wcover31/BNStory/National/home)

lost some $25 billion due to non-bank asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP). Their Value-at-Risk (VaR) model did not take into account liquidity risk. As usual, the quants got the blame.
