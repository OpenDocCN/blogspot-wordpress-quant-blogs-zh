    could easily chronicle the recent decline in volatility, but that’s a story many
    pundits have already flogged to within an inch of its life, so it’s time for something
    else. Like volume.

    plucked out a chart in hopes of being provocative.

- en: In the [StockCharts](http://stockcharts.com/) lexicon, $NYTV is one of [several
    measures](http://support.stockcharts.com/forums/29738/entries/35319) of NYSE volume.
    Specifically, it is the daily NYSE volume figure reported by the [Wall Street
    Journal](http://online.wsj.com/mdc/public/page/mdc_us_stocks.html?mod=mdc_topnav_2_3002)
    and the one I have chosen to standardize on for my own charts. The chart below
    uses the NYTV numbers to plot NYSE total volume (dotted black line) against the
    backdrop of a solid gray area chart for the SPX, with data going back to May 2008\.
    To smooth out some of the fluctuations and holiday-induced dips in volume, I have
    added a 9-day exponential moving average (EMA) as a solid blue line. I have also
    included a 10-day rate of change (ROC) study below the main chart.

- en: While readers will undoubtedly draw their own conclusions from the chart, I
    have chosen to highlight three bottoms in the 9-day volume EMA. The first one
    occurs in late August 2008, just before the Lehman-induced September swoon. The
    second bottom is from late December, just before the January top. With Friday’s
    late volume surge triggered by the Russell index reconstitution, the spike in
    volume is almost certain to confirm that the mid-June volume drought will now
    become another bottom. The dip in volume coincided with the most recent top in
    the SPX and it is possible that for the third time in 1 ½ years, the volume bottom
    could signal a multi-month drop in the SPX.
