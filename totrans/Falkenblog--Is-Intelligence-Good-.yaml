    correlated with better socioeconomic outcomes in education, income, health, and
    crime. It may seem obvious that you want your kids to be smarter.

    they do not make better spouses and partners, and they do not make better parents,
    precisely because these are things our ancestors have done for hundreds of thousands
    of years on the African savanna.

- en: by other evolutionary psychologists, is that intelligence applies to novel human
    activities, so simple but very meaningful and important tasks like friendship,
    social exchange, mating, and parenting are at best orthogonal to such intelligence.
    He argues that more intelligent people reject the simplistic solutions offered
    by common sense as applied to these time-tested arenas even though it is usually
    the correct solution. Intelligent people are tempted to apply analytic reasoning
    instead of feelings, unnecessarily complex ideas simply because their intelligence
    allows them to entertain such complex ideas. "

    evolutionary dead end. He cites a study of a bunch of gifted kids who had IQs
    higher than 155, and years later found they were clearly more successful as adults
    in scientific and academic achievement, but were less successful in parenting
    and marriage.

    frequency of excercise is significantly positively associated with general intelligence,
    a fact that I will use in Calvinist fashion to motivate me (ie, I must work out
    because I am more intelligent!).
