    Shannon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon), the genius of Information
    theory fame, came up with an approach to investing in the market using a interesting
    variant of Kelly’s betting approach.

- en: In effect, this is a ratcheting investment approach. As was pointed out, most
    assets are not constant mean over time. This would imply a strategy that trades
    mean reversion around a longer term drift in the mean. How might such a strategy
    work?

    the ratio of cash to position will depend on this

    later extended on this concept with non-even distribution of allocations with
    his Constant Universal Portfolio (CUP).
