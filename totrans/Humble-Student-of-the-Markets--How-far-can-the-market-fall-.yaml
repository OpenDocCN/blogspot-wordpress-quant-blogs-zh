    Three market leadership themes in the latest bull cycle has been US over global
    stocks, large cap growth over value, and large caps over small caps. Transitions
    from bull to bear phase act to cleanse the excesses of the previous cycle. Until
    we see definitive signs of leadership changes, it may be too early to call a market
    top just yet.

    global stocks is consolidating sideways after an uptrend; growth beating value,
    but pulling back; and small caps still lagging large caps after a brief episode
    of better relative performance.
