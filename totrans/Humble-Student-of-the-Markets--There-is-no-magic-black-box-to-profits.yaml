    different ZBT signals, Even discounting the different versions of the ZBT buy
    signals, I think that everyone can conclude that we saw a bona fide ZBT buy signal
    last week.

    we rely on ZBT to take action in our portfolios. My conclusion, which agrees with
    Rob Hanna, is that the stock market tends to rise after ZBT buy signals. At worse,
    stocks didn't go up, so a long position really doesn't hurt you very much. The
    poor ZBT returns from the 1930's represent a market environment from a long-ago
    era that may not be applicable today and therefore those results should be discounted.
