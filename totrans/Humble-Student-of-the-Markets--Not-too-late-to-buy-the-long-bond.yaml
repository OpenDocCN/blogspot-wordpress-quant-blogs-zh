    hand. But if we are about to enter a recession, then there will probably be another
    year of market weakness to endure. If there is a recession ahead, and it does
    look as though the odds of one are rising inexorably, then take note that only
    27% of bear markets occur prior to the first month of economic contraction (in
    terms of the total decline from the pre-recession highs). So no matter how much
    the market anticipates, it is never enough at the onset - the bear phase is only
    a bit more than one-quarter done by the time the recession tide washes ashore.

  zh: 如果这是一个普通的调整，那么一个买入机会很可能就在眼前。但如果我们即将进入衰退，那么可能还需要忍受市场一年的弱势。如果前方有衰退，而且看起来衰退的可能性正在不断上升，那么请注意，在经济收缩的第一个月之前，只有27%的熊市发生（从衰退前的高点计算的总跌幅）。所以无论市场预见到多少，在衰退浪潮涌来时，都远远不够——熊市阶段在衰退到来时只完成了不到四分之一。

    to the 2008 levels recently, the downside potential on long bond yields are much
    greater. The most recent FOMC announcement that rates would be kept low for another
    two years was a signal for the market to take on the carry trade - to borrow short
    and lend long for at least two years. This caused the yield curve to flatten in
    the short end but steepen in the long end. The downside potential on the 30-year
    is 2.0% from the current 3.5% level - a much greater capital gains potential of
    roughly 25% given its higher duration (and therefore higher interest rate price
    sensitivity of the long bond) compared to the 10-year.

  zh: 资金最大化的地方仍然是长期债券。尽管10年收益率最近下降到了2008年的水平，但长期债券收益率的下行潜力要大得多。最近一次联邦公开市场委员会（FOMC）的声明表示利率将再保持低位两年，这是市场采取套利交易的信号——至少在未来两年内借短贷长。这导致短期收益率曲线平坦化，而长期收益率曲线陡峭化。从当前的3.5%水平来看，30年收益率的下行潜力为2.0%——考虑到其较高的久期（因此长期债券对利率的敏感性更高），与10年相比，其资本增值潜力大约为25%。
