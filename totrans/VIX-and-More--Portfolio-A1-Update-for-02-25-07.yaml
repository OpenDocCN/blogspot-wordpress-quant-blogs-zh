    Portfolio A1, a live mechanical portfolio that I developed and am maintaining

  zh: 上周我[介绍了](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/02/new-feature-2-portfolio123-live.html)投资组合A1，这是一个我开发并维护在[Portfolio123.com](http://www.portfolio123.com/index.jsp)的实时机械投资组合。
- en: For those that may be interested in watching the progress of this portfolio
    in the coming weeks and beyond, it is only appropriate that I talk a little about
    two predecessor portfolios that I modeled this portfolio after, as I believe the
    two ancestral relations may provide some clues about the offspring I am babysitting.

  zh: 对于那些可能对关注这个投资组合在未来几周及更长时间内的进展感兴趣的人来说，适当的是我稍微谈论一下我根据其建模的两个前身投资组合，因为我相信这两个祖先关系可能为我所抚养的子孙提供一些线索。
- en: The first predecessor portfolio went live on 12/31/04 and uses a very similar
    stock ranking system and buying setups as Portfolio A1; the largest difference
    is in the selling rules, which are less restrictive in this portfolio than comparted
    to Portfolio A1.  In the intervening 26 months, this portfolio has returned 94.63%
    vs. 19.74% in the S&P500.  It has also had a maximum drawdown of 20.61% from peak
    levels during this period.  One statistic that is important to note is that the
    annual turnover in this portfolio is 802%; in other words, the typical stock in
    this portfolio turns over 9 times ever year or once every 5.8 weeks.

  zh: 第一个前身投资组合于2004年12月31日上线，并使用与投资组合A1非常相似的股票排名系统和买入设置；最大的区别在于卖出规则，这个投资组合的规则相比投资组合A1要宽松。在接下来的26个月里，这个投资组合的回报率为94.63%，而标普500的回报率为19.74%。在此期间，该投资组合从峰值水平下跌了20.61%。需要注意的是一个重要统计数据是，这个投资组合的年换手率为802%；换句话说，这个投资组合中的典型股票每年周转9次，或者每5.8周周转一次。
- en: The second predecessor portfolio, which only went live on 8/11/06, is almost
    identical to the first portfolio in terms of a stock ranking system, but has a
    slightly tighter set of buying and selling rules -- much more in keeping with
    Portfolio A1.  In its 6 ½ month life span, this portfolio has returned 58.37%
    vs. 14.58% in the S&P500, with a maximum drawdown of only 7.60%.  Because of the
    tighter buying and selling criteria, this portfolio has posted an annual turnover
    of 3098% to date, meaning that the typical stock has an average holding period
    of only 1.6 weeks.

  zh: 第二个前身投资组合于2006年8月11日上线，在股票排名系统方面与第一个投资组合几乎完全相同，但买入和卖出规则更为严格——与投资组合A1更为一致。在其6个半月的生命周期内，这个投资组合的回报率为58.37%，而标普500的回报率为14.58%，最大跌幅仅为7.60%。由于买入和卖出标准的更为严格，这个投资组合目前的年换手率为3098%，意味着典型的股票平均持有期限仅为1.6周。
- en: This would be a good place to keep in mind the typical past performance caveats,
    but I think it is most important to acknowledge that Portfolio A1 is more likely
    to have annual turnover in the 3000% range, which means substantial transaction
    costs.  As a result, I have dispensed with the $10 commissions for the predecessor
    portfolios and am using $5 commissions, comparable to those that are available
    from [TradeKing.com](https://www.tradeking.com/) (which happens to also have an
    excellent [blog](http://tradeking.financialblogs.com/blog), for those who are
    interested.)

  zh: 在这里提醒注意过去业绩的典型警告是很重要的，但我认为最重要的是要承认投资组合A1更有可能实现年换手率在3000%的范围内，这意味着交易成本较高。因此，我取消了前身投资组合的10美元佣金，并采用了5美元的佣金，这与[TradeKing.com](https://www.tradeking.com/)提供的佣金相当（对于有兴趣的人来说，该网站还拥有一个优秀的[博客](http://tradeking.financialblogs.com/blog)）。
- en: As luck would have it, Portfolio A1 has no buying or selling transactions this
    week, as the graph below indicates. Though it is not particularly meaningful at
    this early date, it is interesting to note that while the S&P500 has been down
    a small amount since the portfolio went live, Portfolio A1 is already up 2.67%
    to date and has a 3% cushion on the benchmark. Starting next week, I will provide
    some commentary on the holdings and on any transactions that may be triggered.

  zh: 运气使然，Portfolio A1本周没有买卖交易，如下面的图表所示。虽然在这个早期日期并没有特别大的意义，但有趣的是，自从投资组合成立以来，尽管标普500指数小幅下跌，Portfolio
    A1迄今为止已经上涨了2.67%，并且比基准指数高出3%的缓冲。从下周开始，我将对持仓以及可能触发的任何交易提供一些评论。
