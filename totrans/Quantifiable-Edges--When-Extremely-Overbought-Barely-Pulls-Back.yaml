- en: To qualify for the study the market first needs to be very overbought and then
    second it needs to pull back extremely gently. The 2-day RSI is such a sensitive
    indicator that any decent pullback – even from a very overbought condition – would
    normally see it close below 85\. While the sample size is very small, historically
    this has always been followed by a pullback.
