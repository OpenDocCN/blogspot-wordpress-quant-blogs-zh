- en: I’ve finished [Derman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emanuel_Derman)‘s book now,
    and rate it very highly. Anyone going into software development for rates trading
    should read it. I’ve mentioned before how it’s a great combination of personal
    narrative and anecdotage. The final chapters top this off with some great pop
    science writing on financial engineering innovations since Black-Scholes. Usually
    the authors of accessible pop science texts are not the same people as those who
    made the original breakthroughs. Derman is great at explaining the work of [Black](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fischer_Black),
    [Scholes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myron_Scholes) and [Merton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Merton).
    By way of explaining the [Black-Derman-Toy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-Derman-Toy_model)
    interest rate model he gives us an accessible explanation of curve bootstrapping.
    His coverage of the puzzle of the [volatility smile](http://finmath.stanford.edu/seminars/documents/Stanford.Smile.Derman.pdf)
    and the use of binomial trees in modelling it is excellent too.
