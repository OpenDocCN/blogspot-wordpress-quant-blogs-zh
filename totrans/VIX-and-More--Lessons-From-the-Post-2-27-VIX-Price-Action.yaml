    in the VIX on [2/27](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/February%2027),
    there were many voices insisting that volatility was returning to the markets.  For
    a week or two, they were occasionally correct, but I do not believe you can put
    a VIX spike in historical context until at least 20 trading days have passed since
    the spike.  The 20^(th) trading day, it turns out, was last Tuesday, so let’s
    do a post-mortem.

    27^(th) close of 18.31.  While we did see some [‘echo volatility’](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/03/vix-spikes-and-echo-volatility.html)
    that briefly pushed the VIX into the 20s on the 4^(th) and 11^(th) day following
    the spike, for the last 14 trading days the VIX has only closed above 15 once,
    on March 29^(th), and even then it just barely managed to do so.

    camp since the 2/27 spike.  On March 1, I posted some graphs showing what had
    happened to the VIX over the course of the subsequent 20 trading days in the [eight
    previous instances following a 30% spike](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/03/vix-spikes-and-echo-volatility.html).  In
    short, the conclusion was to expect considerable mean reversion in the first 10
    days or so, with a couple of echo volatility spikes.  The high probability trade
    was to expect mean reversion to win out over any subsequent volatility spikes
    and if you followed any of my [suggested mean reversion VIX options trades](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/02/four-ways-to-play-vix-options-following.html),
    you undoubtedly did very well.

- en: All of which brings us back to the present.  How has the VIX price action following
    2/27 compared to the VIX price action in previous 30% VIX spikes?  The answer
    to this question, which can be discerned from the graph below of normalized closing
    prices, is that the two echo volatility spikes on day 4 and day 11 look eerily
    similar to the historical record.  For the most part, the 2/27 VIX spike has been
    followed by very little volatility.  In fact on only two days out of the 20 days
    subsequent to the spike did the VIX close at a level above the historical mean.  I
    find it even more interesting that from days 14 through 20 (March 19–27), the
    VIX closed below the historical low on each day, down an aggregate 20-33%.

    spike](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/fade%20the%20spike)” play on
    the mean reversion side and be prepared to bet against the likely one or two instances
    of echo volatility.  History is on your side.
