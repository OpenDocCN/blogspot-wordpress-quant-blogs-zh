- en: As the chart below shows, the last two times the VIX has taken a run at 20 (late
    October and late November), stocks have responded by selling off and spiking volatility.
    It is possible that a VIX of 20 may still be something that investors are not
    yet ready to accept ([availability bias](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/availability%20bias)),
    but with historical volatility hovering around 16 and the long-term trend in the
    VIX still moving downward, it is likely just a matter of time before we see a
    VIX in the 19s.

    VIX levels, which is where the [moving average envelopes](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/moving%20average%20envelopes)
    come in. Displayed as a blue zone in the middle of the trading range on the chart,
    the 10 day simple moving average envelopes make it easy to identify when the VIX
    is extended to the high side or the low side. While the 20 level has been well
    out of the moving average envelopes for the last two drops in the VIX, that is
    not likely to be the case going forward. This sets the possibility of a battle
    between the absolute VIX (support at 20) vs. the relative VIX (support at the
    bottom of the envelope) in the near future, with an increased likelihood that
    the 20 level does not hold the next time around.

    seasonal factors also indicate that volatility should be moving lower. I have
    discussed the [holiday effect](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Holiday%20Effect)
    several times in the past in this space and essentially the historical pattern
    calls for the VIX to hold relatively steady for the first two weeks of December,
    then drop sharply (probably about 1.5 points at current levels) as Christmas approaches.
