    is a chart that tackles a subject I have not seen discussed to the extent I believe
    it deserves or presents some new material to shine a different light on the subject.

  zh: 我通常会确保本周的[图表](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week)是解决了我认为值得深入讨论的话题，或者以新的视角呈现了一些新材料。
- en: Since I have been out of pocket for the last five days or so, it is possible
    that others have beaten the subject of [retail sales](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/retail%20sales)
    to death during this period. Even if this is the case, I have no problem with
    a chart of retail sales pinch hitting for this week’s chart of the week, as I
    believe that the April retail sales data are a microcosm of the larger economic
    picture. In a nutshell, the retail sales data serve as a reminder that while things
    may have improved somewhat from March, for the most part, the economy is still
    as weak as it has been in at least three decades, probably a lot longer.

  zh: 由于我近五天来一直不在状态，其他人可能在我不在的这段时间里已经把[零售销售](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/retail%20sales)这个话题讨论得十分透彻。即使如此，我也没有问题，因为我相信四月份的零售销售数据是本周图表的缩影，可以代表更广泛的经济形势。简而言之，零售销售数据提醒我们，虽然从三月份开始情况有所改善，但总体上，经济仍然像过去三十年，甚至更长时间以来一样疲弱。
- en: The graphic below shows the percentage change in retail sales from the year
    ago period. Are things improving significantly or are we just starting to scrape
    along the bottom? It looks as if it will take at least another 2-3 months of data
    before we can begin to answer this question properly.

  zh: 下面的图表显示了零售销售同比增长百分比。情况是否有显著改善，还是我们只是开始触底反弹？看来至少需要另外2-3个月的数据，我们才能正确回答这个问题。
