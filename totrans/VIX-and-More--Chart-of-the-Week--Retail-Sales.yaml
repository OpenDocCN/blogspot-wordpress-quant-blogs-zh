    is a chart that tackles a subject I have not seen discussed to the extent I believe
    it deserves or presents some new material to shine a different light on the subject.

    that others have beaten the subject of [retail sales](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/retail%20sales)
    to death during this period. Even if this is the case, I have no problem with
    a chart of retail sales pinch hitting for this week’s chart of the week, as I
    believe that the April retail sales data are a microcosm of the larger economic
    picture. In a nutshell, the retail sales data serve as a reminder that while things
    may have improved somewhat from March, for the most part, the economy is still
    as weak as it has been in at least three decades, probably a lot longer.

- en: The graphic below shows the percentage change in retail sales from the year
    ago period. Are things improving significantly or are we just starting to scrape
    along the bottom? It looks as if it will take at least another 2-3 months of data
    before we can begin to answer this question properly.
