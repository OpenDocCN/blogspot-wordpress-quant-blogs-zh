# Single Dealer Platforms – Another Day Another View | Tales from a Trading Desk

## Single Dealer Platforms – Another Day Another View

WallStreet & Technology offers a [view](http://www.wallstreetandtech.com/trading-technology/single-dealer-platforms-are-their-days-numbered/a/d-id/1316535) on Single Dealer Platforms (SDP).  Over the last few years there have been a number of articles stating that SDP’s will either take over the world, or are a dying breed.  The net out of this latest article is unsurprisingly a view that Single Dealer Platforms and Multi Dealer Platforms will be combined by either banks or clients to offer a subset of services based on the clients needs – best of breed (effectively a type of [mashup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashup_%28web_application_hybrid%29)).

Further, the article hints at the opportunity for non-bank/clients to offer custom aggregation SDP/MBP.  Obviously, this is easier were SDP/MBP’s already offer features via FIX or similar API’s.  However the problem area will be in the User Interface (UI) space, where for example a client wants Bank A’s FX functionality, Bank B’s Bonds, and Bank C’s Repo’s.  It becomes even more complex if a client wants a subset of an asset class – unless of course the UI has been built in a very modular way.  We’ll ignore the single sign-on issues for now.

Part of the solution maybe the App Store concept that Apple has helped drive into so many markets.  Deutsche bank has such an App Store [offering](http://www.americanbanker.com/issues/178_105/deutsche-bank-expands-its-app-store-for-corporate-clients-1059543-1.html).  As to how well it would work in the SDP/MBP aggregate arena is another question.
