- en: An unusual labor market shift has occurred since the onset of the pandemic.
    Employers everywhere are complaining about a lack of quality employees. The Beveridge

  zh: 自疫情爆发以来，劳动力市场发生了一次不同寻常的转变。世界各地的雇主都在抱怨缺乏优质的员工。贝弗里奇曲线描述了失业率和职位空缺率之间的关系，已经显著陡峭。
- en: Workers are not returning to their jobs, at least not without considerably more
    incentives. Some factors that affected labor supply are temporary and should moderate
    over time, such as the fear of catching COVID-19 and childcare availability, but
    many people are reassessing their priorities in the wake of the pandemic. They
    call it the "Great Resignation".

  zh: 工人没有回到他们的工作岗位，至少在没有更多的激励措施的情况下不会回去。影响劳动力供应的一些因素是暂时的，应该随着时间的推移而缓和，比如担心感染COVID-19和儿童看护的可用性，但许多人正在重新评估他们在疫情后的优先事项。他们称之为“大辞职”。
