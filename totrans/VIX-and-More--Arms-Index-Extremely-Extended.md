# VIX and More: Arms Index Extremely Extended

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/12/arms-index-extremely-extended.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/12/arms-index-extremely-extended.html#0001-01-01)

The Arms Index or [TRIN](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TRIN) is an indicator that I watch closely for short to intermediate-term setups. The indicator which combines ratios of advancing issues to declining issues and advancing volume to declining volume is a reasonably reliable contrary signal.

Since mid-October the Arms Index has been generating a number of historically high signals. In the chart below, I used a 10 day exponential moving average as a smoothing factor. Note that the TRIN’s 10 day EMA appears to have climaxed yesterday in the manner that has historically provided excellent buying opportunities. To my ears, yesterday’s climax in the TRIN is suggesting that the November 21^(st) bottom is likely to hold. Shorts beware…
