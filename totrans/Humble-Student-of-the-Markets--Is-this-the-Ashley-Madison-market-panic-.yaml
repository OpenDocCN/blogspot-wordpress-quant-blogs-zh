    to consider whether earnings growth will prove sufficient to support current stock
    market valuations. The rapidly aging earnings cycle is perhaps best illustrated
    by an economy nearing full employment with corporate profit margins near record
    highs. Should global growth remain tepid and overall sales results modest, since
    profit margins are unlikely to rise much, earnings trends will also likely prove
    disappointing. Conversely, should global growth and corporate sales results accelerate,
    because the U.S. is nearing full employment, companies may soon face cost-push
    pressures and margin erosion which will likely off set improved sales results.

    the fundamental impetus for the weak intermediate term technical internals to

    call and these risks are unlikely to be discounted by the market in the immediate

    stock prices strengthen after the likely two week rally that is typical of the
