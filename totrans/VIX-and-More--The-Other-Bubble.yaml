    except North Dakota, Arkansas and Oklahoma) and seen a lot more of this country
    than most will ever see, so when I look at the various foreclosure and [subprime
    maps](http://images.google.com/images?svnum=10&um=1&hl=en&safe=off&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&q=subprime+map&btnG=Search+Images)
    that have been making the rounds lately, it is easy for me to picture many of
    these places and the residents I have met there along the way.'

    [Marin County](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marin_County,_California), which in
    many ways, is like living in a completely different kind of bubble in terms of
    real estate values, disposable income, attitudes, politics, etc.  When it comes
    to real estate in the area, starter homes in the $3 million range are not uncommon.  For
    some additional context, a couple of years ago my wife and I looked at a local
    $8.5 million house that lacked a private master bedroom and was in need of a fair
    amount in the way of repairs.

- en: In spite of the projections by the [Marin Real Estate Bubble](http://marinrealestatebubble.blogspot.com/)
    blog, local real estate has been surprisingly resilient.  The [Marin Real Estate
    Report](http://www.westbayre.com/report_marin.html) tracks a variety of real estate
    data and is the source of the graphic below, which shows that for the past seven
    years, real estate has climbed fairly steadily, at least when adjusted for seasonal
    trends.  The story is different in other parts of <state st="on">California</state>,
    as [comparable San Diego data](http://rereport.com/sdc/main_csd.html) show, but
    for now at least, the full extent of the Marin bubble seems to be intact.
