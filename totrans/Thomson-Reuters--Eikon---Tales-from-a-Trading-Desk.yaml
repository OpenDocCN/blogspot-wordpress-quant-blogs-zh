    platform.  With its recent release on the Blackberry 10, its mobile strategy is
    nicely covering the business community devices – Pad, iPhone and previous BlackBerry
    devices, with [Android](http://www.wallstreetandtech.com/data-management/will-thomson-reuters-eikon-app-woo-wall/240158762)
    support being offered in the near future.  Blackberry World offers a few [screen](http://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/32066887/)
    shots of the application itself, coupled with a brief overview of the functionality
    – no trading appears to be supported from the Blackberry 10.  More screen shots
    and info on Eikon is available over on the Thomson Reuters [site](https://thomsonreuterseikon.com/features/market-analysis-app/). 
    I’d be curious if anyone know what Eikon uses for streaming prices to the mobile
    devices

    to real time financial markets data on their BlackBerry 10 device. Best of all
    it comes in a fast and fluid native UI experience
