    was rising, Klein wanted to debate Kaus about health care on Bloggingheads.tv,
    but Kaus would have none of it because he thought Klein was an unworthy neophyte
    (5 years out of college with a poli-sci degree). Now, Klein''s one of the top
    lefty pundits, a columnist for The Washington Post, Newsweek, a contributor to
    MSNBC, and often on the Sunday talk shows. Klein is now too popular for Kaus and
    the tables are turned: Kaus wants to debate Klein but Klein won''t stoop to Kaus''s
    lower level of popularity.'

    problem with Kaus is that he''s accumulated principles: he''s generally a Liberal
    for greater equality, but thinks many standard solutions--unions, welfare, untrammeled
    immigration--are counterproductive. This leaves Kaus without a base because conservatives
    don''t like his Liberal likes, whereas good Democrats don''t criticize their base
    on things like unions and immigration.'

    In contrast, someone like Kaus who actually thinks for himself will invariably
    present idiosyncratic ideas which by definition are seen by most people as unconventional
    and wrong. This rubs the rubes the wrong way, they see you as an undependable
    intellectual ally, not part of the team. In a sense, they are right.
