    balcony. The heat is too intense so you call the Fire Department. The fire fighters
    arrive, but they don't put out the fire. (We aren't sure if the balcony is stable
    enough to hold fire fighters so we have to formulate a durable policy for dealing
    with future fires in this building.) Instead they call the fire inspector.

    ability "to walk its talk" – despite repeated assertions that it would do "whatever

    hampered negotiations. Despite the government's attempt to appease rescue creditors
    by unveiling a new round of draconian cuts last week, the Greek finance minister,
    Evangelos Venizelos, received a cool reception at the IMF's annual meeting in
    Washington last weekend. Christine Lagarde, the body's managing director, insisted
