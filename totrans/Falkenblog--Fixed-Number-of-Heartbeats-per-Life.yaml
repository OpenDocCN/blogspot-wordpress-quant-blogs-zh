- en: 'has a post on the fixed heartbeat theory of life: all organisms have approximately
    the same number of heartbeats per life. If we measure the heart rate of a mouse
    and multiply it by the lifespan, we get a number that is similar for most other
    mammals, whether horse, cow, cat, dog or guinea pig. This is related to the hypothesis
    that the total amount of oxygen ''processed'' is constant, and the oxidative stress
    from this causes the cells to break down. This is because ''free-radicals'' are
    produced in oxidation, and these molecules do damage to DNA and other essential
    cellular machinery.'

    or drosphilia to more food, both of which sped up their metabolism, and shortened
    their lives (and vice versa).

    rate like a mouse, which lives for about 3 years. Pigeons have the same BMR as
    rats, yet live 10 times longer. Then there are hummingbirds which have incredibly
    high heartbeats and metabolism, yet live 10 years.

    of metabolism, but the efficiency of metabolism, and the amount of repair within
    the cell. Birds have very efficient mitochondria, relatively little leakage of
    oxidants like hydrogen peroxide in the process, compared to mammals. There are
    mutation repair genes, and enzymes that are very effective at getting rid of radicals
    (eg, Superoxide dimutase).

    correlation between total metabolism and life, might suggest that one should focus
    on eating less, being leaner. All good in small doses, but too little energy is
    hardly an attractive payoff, as expending energy is part of a vibrant life. More
    practically, assuming one is in relatively lean shape, one should focus research
    on aiding our production of anti-oxidants and gene repair mechanisms (such as
    telomerase, which repairs the telomeres). See

    more is better, this does not not actually work: education, health care, more
    information in mortgage contracts. Invariably, trying to increase theses without
    consideration of the whole won''t work, because the system has a delicate balance.
    Sometimes, the most effective part to exogenously alter is not the most obvious;
    it often promises, alas, modest improvement. But these are much more realistic.
    I think a more explicit description of one''s assets would be useful. It wouldn''t
    erase the problem, but I''m still dumbfounded by the amount of AAA rated paper
    on bank''s balance sheets, as this was clearly a sign of bad internal pricing.'
