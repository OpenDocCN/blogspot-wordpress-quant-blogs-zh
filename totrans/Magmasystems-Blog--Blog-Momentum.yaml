- en: On December 18th, I looked at my ClustrMap and saw that I had 239 visitors on
    the previous day. While this is nothing compared to the big blogs out there, it
    is definitely an improvement from the 30-40 per day that I had last year. I am
    not sure if my involvement with CEP has anything to do with it, or if it is becoming
    more well known across the Wall Street community (I believe it's the latter).

    that I get have also increased, as a lot of you share your opinions about working
    on Wall Street, evals of CEP vendors, etc.

    me tell you that there are a HUGE number of people from my company who read my
    blog, not only from the tech side, but from the business side as well. The former
    CTO of our company was a big blog reader of mine. The CIO of our company has his
    own internal blog, and I know that people have recommended my blog to him.

- en: at what other big financial companies are doing with blogs and wikis. Enlightened
    management at financial institutions will embrace social networking and a more
    open community, not run scared at the thoughts of what a competitor might pick
    up from a blog. Wall Street and The City are very close-knit communities, and
    more information passes between the employees at Lehman and Goldman during Happy
    Hour than whatever can be revealed from a blog.
