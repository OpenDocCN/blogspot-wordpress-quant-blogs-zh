- en: about one of Nassim Taleb-affiliated fund Universa Investments LP (he's merely
    an advisor, but he takes credit when it does well and it's run based on his long-Black
    Swan theory). Supposedly, they made a big trade around 2 pm EST on Thursday, just
    before the market tanked. As the electronic exchanges were spotty a large order
    like this didn't help, and wasn't very savvy on a pure tactical level (ie, don't
    make big trades when systems are down).

    Around 2 PM EST, it was price about $4.30\. It went to about $8 (one bizarre print
    at $14), and is now about $2.50\. Whatever he bought is probably down 50%.

    track records and take excessive risk with other-people's money, all due to cognitive
    biases they are too shallow to notice in themselves. Oh yeah, Taleb has done that!
    I guess his insider status gives him better insight.
