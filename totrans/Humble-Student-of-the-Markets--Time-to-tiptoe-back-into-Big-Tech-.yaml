    (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold
    extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa). Subscribers receive
    real-time alerts of model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of the email
    alerts is updated weekly [here](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/trading-track-record/).
    The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that
    began in March 2016 is shown below.

- en: In discussions with investors, I have been asked if Are Big Tech has formed
    a bottom. Big Tech had been the leadership in the U.S. equity market. It’s an
    important group as it forms roughly 40% of the weight of the S&P 500\. The NYSE
    FANG Plus Index staged an upside breakout out of a cup and handle pattern with
    long-term bullish implications. The index then pulled back and it’s bouncing off
    a relative support zone (bottom panel).
