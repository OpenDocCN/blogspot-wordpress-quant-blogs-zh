    it reaches extremes.

    so it is now at fairly extreme levels. The last time the Bull-Bear Spread was
    this low was in early July as the July rally was just beginning. Prior to that
    is was the first week of November of ’09 just as that rally was kicking off, and
    the time before that was early March of ’09 just before that rally began.

    you may get all the data using the AAII link I provided above. Just scroll down
    and you’ll find a link to a historical spreadsheet on the right hand side of the
    page.) Below is a sample if the kind of results I saw when conducting some studies.

- en: So what we see here is that an extremely pessimistic outlook from investors
    has been followed by a rise in the market on pretty consistent basis. Six weeks
    later the market has been higher 81% of the time and the average gain was over
    7%. The problem is that the failures have been very, very large. Using the same
    6-week time frame the average loss was 10% and the max loss was 27%. The max loss
    occurred in September/October of 2008\. August of 1990 also saw a sharp decline
    in the spread to levels similar to current levels. That was followed by further
    selling that maxed out around a 12% decline between then and October. Other instances
    that were followed by large selloffs included July of 2002 with a 12% decline
    and February 2009 with a 14% decline.

    of a rally emerging over the next several weeks. But if the market can’t manage
    to rally then the probable alternative is a substantial selloff.
