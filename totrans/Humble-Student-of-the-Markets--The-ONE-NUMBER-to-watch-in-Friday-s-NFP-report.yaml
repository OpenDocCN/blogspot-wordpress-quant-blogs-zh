- en: The consensus headline figure for Friday's NFP release is 234K, but I will be
    paying far less attention to that number than the Average Hourly Earnings figure
    which will be released at the same time. That's because the Fed has been watching
    wage growth for signs of rising inflation.

    scenario, we need to see some justification in the form of wage pressures. The
    4Q 2014 Employment Cost Index, which is arguably a better measure of wage inflation
    because it is a fixed-weight measure and adjusts for shifts in employment categories,
    came in at 0.6% (vs. 0.7% for 3Q). While that does represent a deceleration in
    the ECI, the YoY change was 2.3%, which is well above the Fed's 2% inflation target.

- en: By contrast, Average Hourly Earnings is not a fixed-weight measure of wages
    and therefore it does not represent an apples-to-apples comparison of wage pressures.
    As an example, higher growth in low-wages jobs will depress Average Hourly Earnings
    compared to the ECI. Nevertheless, it is an monthly series and provides more frequent
    readings than the quarterly ECI.

    therefore be watching the January release carefully to see if December was a statistical
    blip (and to see if December gets revised upward.)
