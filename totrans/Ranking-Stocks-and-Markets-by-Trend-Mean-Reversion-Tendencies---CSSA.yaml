- en: 'Most traders have a strong preference for trend or mean-reversion strategies
    but rarely both. Sometimes markets trend, sometimes they mean-revert. The periodicity
    of this behavior is also distinct whether you are looking at the short-term or
    long-term time frames. When markets change, if you only employ a specific style
    you will underperform–this is guaranteed. The are only two solutions: 1) is to
    diversify by strategy and time-frame 2) **is to find the best markets that suit
    your style at a given point in time–if the broader market isn’t trending for example
    (and you are a trend trader), then find a stock, commodity or ETF that is trending
    well.** The real question is how to identify such situations– do markets or stocks
    have long-term or short-term tendencies that can be extrapolated reliably? The
    answer is a resounding–YES! It is possible to identify markets that are best suited
    to mean-reversion or trend strategies. The Livermore Index is one good example
    of a methodology that identifies trending stocks, but also looks at relative performance.
    However, as we shall soon see, the method is applicable in both directions–to
    also identify mean-reverting stocks/markets.'
