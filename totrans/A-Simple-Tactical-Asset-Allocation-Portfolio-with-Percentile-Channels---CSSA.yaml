    of readers that would like to see how they can be applied to creating strategies.
    So here is a very simple strategy that applies [Percentile Channels](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2015/01/21/percentile-channels-a-new-twist-on-a-trend-following-favorite/
    "Percentile Channels: A New Twist On a Trend-Following Favorite") from the last
    post to a tactical asset allocation strategy. The strategy starts with only 4
    diversified asset classes:'

    months in the momentum literature- (4 separate systems) with a .75 long entry
    and .25 exit threshold with long triggered above .75 and holding through until
    exiting below .25 (just like in the previous post)

    assets (no leverage is used). This is 1/volatility (asset A) divided by the sum
    of 1/volatility for all assets to determine the position size.

- en: This is a very consistent strategy which is more notable for its low maximum
    drawdown and high sharpe ratio (near 2) than its sexy returns. Of course there
    are many alternatives to “spice” this up by varying the allocation among instruments,
    changing instruments or using leverage. I wanted to keep the asset list short
    and simple, and I chose corporate bonds since they provide some of the defensive
    characteristics of treasurys but with a higher yields and arguably lower systematic
    risk (no sovereign risk). Substituting the 10-year treasury with IEF instead of
    corporate bonds produces nearly identical results (1.9 sharpe, 11.8% Cagr, 5.8%
    max dd). There were better combinations of asset classes and parameters, but this
    compact list seemed manageable for a self-directed investor without a large portfolio.This
    is not the ultimate strategy by any means, but shows how to use percentile channels
    to produce a viable approach to tactical asset allocation.
