    asset allocation, model which uses trend following techniques as applied to commodity
    and global stock market prices to generates a composite Risk-On/Risk-Off signal
    (risk-on, risk-off or neutral). I have begun updating readers on the Trend Model
    signals on a weekly basis (for the last comment, see

    of the signal, which are indicated by the arrows, overlaid on top of a chart of
    the SP 500\. You can think of the green up arrows, which occurred when the trend
    signal changed from negative to positive, as buy signals and the red down arrows,
    which occurred when the trend signal changed from positive to negative, as sell
    signals. Note that this is a real-time (not back-tested) record.

    interesting, there is no substitute for actual performance. As a proof of concept,
    I started to manage a small (about 100K) account that traded long, inverse and
    leveraged ETFs on the major US market averages. Trading decisions were based on
    Trend Model signals combined with some short-term sentiment indicators. The inception
    date of the account was September 30, 2013 and the chart below represents a preliminary
    report card of the account.

    is intended to be an absolute return vehicle. While I do show the SPY total return,
    which includes re-invested dividends, for illustrative purposes, the SP 500 is
    not an appropriate benchmark for measuring the performance of this modeling technique.

    of 11.3% while SPY was -1.3%. June was re-stated to 1.2% from 1.5% because I had
    was showing a preliminary estimated result rather than the value on the account
    statement. The July figure reflects the account statement value and is not an
    estimate. I would caution, however, that the July return is overstated by an estimated
    2.6% because the account statement values are based on settlement date accounting
    and trade date accounting, which includes the effect of trades executed but not
    settled as of month-end, lowered returns by 2.6% and the adjustment will show
    up in the returns for August.

- en: The Trend Model was fortunate in spotting the inflection point in the stock
    market in July. Deteriorating technical indicators from commodity and overseas
    equity markets warned of impending US equity market weakness, but I would not
    expect the model to be so prescient at every turn. The main engine is a trend
    following model and such models are, by definition, late in picking up trend changes
    and subject to whipsawing signals, as the disappointing returns in 1Q2014 can
    attest.

- en: While these results are promising, I consider the Trend Model to be untested
    by stressful markets. The test period that began in September 2013 only includes
    a stock market that has only gone up. The acid tests for this model is how it
    behave when the market corrects and when it turns around and starts to rally again.

    period, then the test will have begun. Until then, I would view results with a
    skeptical eye.
