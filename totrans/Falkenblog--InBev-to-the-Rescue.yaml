    expects from a popular beer, which makes sense because beers in America really
    developed their inertia because after prohibition, just as breweries got up to
    speed, WW2 started, and young women were the main beer drinkers left in America,
    so their preferences were very influential. This is unfortunate because

    in this WSJ video. He basically says its bland. He does like InBev's Hoegaarden,
    a very flavorful white-ale, and I must say that is my current favorite. It's like
    Blue Moon, or Paulaner (banana and clove esters), only better. Unlike many brews
    preferred by beer tasters, this one has low bitterness, which would make it an
    easy comparable for Americans used to low bitterness beers. I'm a homebrewer,
    so find this interesting (and being a homebrewer helps me appreciate how inefficient
