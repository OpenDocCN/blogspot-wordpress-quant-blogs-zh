    their cyclical factors from their currency influence. The top panel of the chart
    below shows the highly cyclical industrial metals in USD, which is a chart many
    analysts look at. while the next two panels focuses on the cyclical element of
    commodity prices. A conventional analysis of industrial metals show them to have
    rallied out of a downtrend and in the process of testing support. The middle panel
    filters out much of the effects of USD strength by showing industrial metal prices
    in euros, indicating a minor uptrend with a series of higher lows and higher highs
    (in red) after rallying out of a downtrend. The bottom panel shows lumber prices,
    which is highly dependent on the cyclical sensitive housing sector, to gold prices,
    which is mainly perceived as an alternative currency to the USD. The lumber-gold
    ratio appears to be making a rounded bottom, which is also constructive.
