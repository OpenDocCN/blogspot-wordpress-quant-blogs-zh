    look at core CPI, or the Consumer Price Index ex-food and energy. Inflation is
    happening in hard assets, i.e. commodity prices. QE2 is blowing a hard asset bubble
    and it is precisely this blinkered view of measuring inflation as inflation ex-inflation
    that created the conditions for the last financial crisis.

    prices that we see inflation. Take a look at the point and figure chart of the

    hurdle of double-top resistance. How that chart pattern resolves itself is an
    important "tell" of where the markets move in the near term. Longer term, should
    any of the economic timebombs blow up, the path of commodity prices will also
    be an important important signal of the market direction, of whether it is a Dubai-event
    to be shrugged off or a Russia event that brings down the house of cards.
