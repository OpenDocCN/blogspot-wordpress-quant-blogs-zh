    strongly short-term oversold as measured by RSI(2).  What I found in that letter
    was that lower-volume instances on the first day of the bounce have performed
    much better over the next few days than higher-volume bounces.  I won’t rehash
    the whole study here, but I will show performance following higher volume bounces
    like Thursday.

    to Atlanta next week to speak at the MTA meeting there.  If you’re in the Atlanta
    area and would like more info on my talk you may check out the link below.  You
    don’t need to be an MTA member to attend, but you should consider joining.
