- en: 'Entering the third-quarter earnings season, the world finds itself suffering
    high levels of uncertainty amid simmering geopolitical crises in Ukraine, the
    Middle East and Hong Kong. Further, many major economies, such as the EU, the
    U.S. and Japan, are seeing declining business and consumer confidence, as well
    as increasing income inequality. China too is seeing a slowdown in its residential
    housing. In other words, global corporate earnings have a backdrop of worry. Yet
    when we asked CFA Institute NewsBrief readers, 43% of respondents indicated they
    believe businesses will meet earnings expectations. For those thinking that profits
    will deviate from expectations, respondents believe corporations are likely to
    outperform those that underperform by 2.3 to 1 (40% : 17%). Investors are confident
    of a good earnings season, and perhaps the profit picture of global business will
    ameliorate some of the economic doubts. Yet even if businesses deliver, it seems
    that the corporate earnings season and its gyrations have diminished in importance
    since 2008-2009\. Instead, the market drivers will most likely be interest rates
    and geopolitical predictions.'

    whether that data is strong or weak in an absolute sense. For example, even a
    weak data point may inspire a lift to stocks if it was better than generally expected.
    The chart below depicts how actual data has been faring relative to expectations
    over the past three months and in what direction the data is trending relative
    to those expectations for the world’s major economies.
