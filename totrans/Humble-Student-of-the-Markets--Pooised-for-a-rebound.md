# Humble Student of the Markets: Pooised for a rebound

**Mid-wek market update:**

The S&P 500 became extremely stretched in mid-June when its 14-week RSI exceeded the 90 level. The last two times this happened, the market eventually pulled back and the initial decline was arrested with RSI reached a neutral reading of 50\. That 50 target was reached this week, which I interpret as the market is setting up for a relief rally.
