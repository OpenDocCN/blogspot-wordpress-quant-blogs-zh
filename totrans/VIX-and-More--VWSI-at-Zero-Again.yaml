- en: The VIX Weekly Sentiment Indicator ([VWSI](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VWSI))
    is back at zero for the second week in a row, which is not unusual.  In fact,
    over the long term, the VWSI should generate a zero reading approximately 40%
    of the time and fall in to the +3 to -3 ‘neutral zone’ approximately 80-90% of
    the time.  When it comes to trading the VIX, patience and discipline are absolute
    requirements for high percentage and high expectancy trades.

    an end to the five week double digit pendulum of price swings we noted [last week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/04/vwsi-at-0and-to-drink.html)
    in this space, but continuing to print an intriguing pattern: +75%; -24%; +19%;
    -23%; +13%; and -10%.'

    and 12 VIX puts suggests that someone is staking large money on a continued contraction
    in volatility.

- en: '***Wine pairing:*** The official [wine pairing](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/wine%20pairing)
    for a VWSI of zero is a [Rhone blend](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/04/vwsi-at-0and-to-drink.html).  More
    broadly, it is any affordable and enjoyable red or white that works as an everyday
    wine.  This week I will offer up an inexpensive version of a popular <place st="on">Rhone</place>
    varietal, the broadly advertised and surprisingly drinkable 2005 [Wrongo Dongo](http://www.cellartracker.com/wine.asp?iWine=259935&iNote=341678).  While
    the label is short on information, this wine is from the [Jumilla](http://www.winesfromspain.com/icex/cda/controller/pageGen/0,3346,1549487_4946338_4944445_1072_-1,00.html)
    region of <place st="on"><country-region st="on">Spain</country-region></place>
    and consists primarily of [mourvedre](http://www.rhonerangers.org/grapes/mourvedre.php),
    blended with some cabernet sauvignon and merlot. This is an easy drinking wine,
    but it has enough spice and backbone to stand up to those hard to pair ethnic
    foods.  I found it locally for $7.99 and it can be had for less on sale.  If you
    make money on one side of the market while everyone else is losing money on the
    other side, what could be more appropriate than to open a glass of Wrongo Dongo
    and drink to your contrarian success…'
