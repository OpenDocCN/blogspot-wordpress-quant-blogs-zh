# Quantifiable Edges: Friday Before Labor Day Seasonally Strong

> 来源：[http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2012/08/friday-before-labor-day-seasonally.html#0001-01-01](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2012/08/friday-before-labor-day-seasonally.html#0001-01-01)

The Friday before Labor Day has long been a strong seasonal day for the market.  Below is a stats table based on buying the Thursday before Labor Day and selling the close on Friday.

With 71% of the days finishing higher, a profit factor of over 2.5, and an average trade of 0.3% the stats are quite compelling.  Futures are up pretty strong right now, so this one has a head start.  But
