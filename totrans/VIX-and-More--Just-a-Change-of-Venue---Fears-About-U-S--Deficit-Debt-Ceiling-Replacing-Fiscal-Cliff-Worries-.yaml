    negotiations going down to the wire, it is not surprising that fears related to
    the fiscal cliff topped the list of investor threats to the stock market for the
    eleventh week in a row in the *VIX and More* weekly [fear poll](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Fear%20poll).
    [Fears](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/fear) associated with governments
    and politicians as well as excessive central bank intervention polled in second
    and third place, respectively.

- en: What I found particularly interesting is the sudden rise in fears related to
    the U.S. deficit and debt ceiling, as investors appear to be concluding that the
    current fiscal cliff negotiations are now just one more skirmish in the ongoing
    war between Democrats and Republicans regarding how to address the U.S. budget
    deficit. With Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner [saying](http://money.cnn.com/2012/12/26/news/economy/debt-ceiling/index.html)
    that the U.S. will hit its debt ceiling today and have to resort to extraordinary
    measures to keep under the legal limit, the stage is set for the next pitched
    battle when these extraordinary measures can no longer do their trick, in about
    two months.

- en: So what problems will a fiscal cliff deal resolve? Part of the answer to this
    question depends upon whether the pending (we hope) deal is merely a stopgap measure
    or addresses some of the more politically thorny underlying issues related to
    the budget deficit in a comprehensive way. Of course the trick is structuring
    the deal in such a way that it does so in a manner which limits any negative impact
    on the economy.

    investor fears to the next battleground.
