    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    out to new recovery highs, which is bullish as you can tell the tone of a market
    by how it reacts to what should have been bad news. As the chart below shows,
    the cyclically sensitive industrial metals staged upside breakouts above its 200
    day moving average (dma), as well as new recovery highs. The energy heavy CRB
    Index did break out to the upside, but it is now testing its 200 dma.
