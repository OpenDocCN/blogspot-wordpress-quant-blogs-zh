    lot of issues to discuss about since the release of Michael Lewis’ *Flash Boys*),
    and I think I won’t be able to write seriously until early July. But here is an
    amazing story.

- en: 'One month ago I have had a [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SniperInMahwah) discussion
    with a trader working along with a famous American whistleblower whose name starts with
    B and ends with D, and at some point I received this PM tweet: “*are u purely
    doing studies or trading as well? i’ve heard rumors of you*“. What? Rumors on
    me in Wall Street???'

    been lurking as sniperinmahwah for years before the whole entire twitterverse
    of HFTs came around. Additionally, many didn’t even know you were an anthropologist
    til much later. Some thought u were a practitioner as well.* ” Goddamn! They have
    found me! More seriously, I asked for more precisions and received this: “*1)
    I asked about your twitter handle to my team. 2) XXX* [another trader]* said something
    about how you had been doing studies on something in the HFT space while interacting
    with some of the HFT twitterverse. **3) My head trader mentioned he had seen you
    online before somehow and thought u were a player. *'

    you have with people they follow, may think you are a participant in general especially
    with a name like sniperinmahwah ;).*” Wow. Yes, my Twitter pseudo (SniperInMahwah)
    may be confusing and can make some people paranoid but the explanation is simple:
    in the book in two parts I wrote about HFT and exchanges the narrator is an algorithm
    called Sniper (like the ones used in dark pools) and “he” lives in Mahwah, the
    Nyse facility in NJ. Even if my book is as serious as a true academic work, I
    choose to use this non-human narrator as if the book were written by a machine
    doing data mining. So, I confirm that I am not a trader (I have heard that becoming a
    HFT trader would need $2-4 millions and I don’t have the money), I am just an
    anthropologist and I discovered markets two years ago only.'

    this story is probably the best compliment given to me since I work on this matter.
     Moral of the story: working hard always pays off.'
