- en: In most of the world, yesterday’s big news was that the S&P 500 index fell 5%
    for the second day in a row. Here at VIX Central, I was also interested to note
    that the VIX jumped 10% for the second day in a row, something that has happened
    on nine previous occasions going back to 1990.

- en: From a market timing perspective, the history of consecutive double digit jumps
    in the VIX does show a significant bullish bias going forward, but not one that
    develops until after the first day. In the graphic below, courtesy of Yahoo, I
    have also put these nine double jumps into historical perspective by marking them
    with blue arrows. These double jump days do tend to appear at important inflection
    points, but these are not necessarily at reversals, nor are they necessarily associated
    with bull markets. On balance, however, I would consider this double jump VIX
    activity to be a bullish development.
