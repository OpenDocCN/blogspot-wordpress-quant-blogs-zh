    of big funds have improved? Or maybe that's because in 2011, the deviation from
    factor returns mean-revert within a few days, so those statarb models that re-balance
    on a daily basis can benefit from the buying/selling opportunity at steep discount/premium?

    began officially on 20110808: despite a steep drawdown, the overall performance
    was spectacular! Clearly, high volatility benefited a prototypical statarb strategy,

    strategy instead: enter all positions at the open, and exit them all at the close?
    I tried it: the performance is surprisingly similar to the interday strategy.
    So intraday vs. interday volatility or mean-reversion does not seem to play a
    part in last year''s equities market. Contrasting this with the performance of
    Forex models, it is clear that high volatilities benefited statarb models while
    they hurt FX models.'
