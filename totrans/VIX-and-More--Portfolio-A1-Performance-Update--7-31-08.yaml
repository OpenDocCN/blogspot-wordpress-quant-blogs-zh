    for Portfolio A1 since the equities only (no ETFs or options), long only portfolio
    was created on February 16, 2007.  During the 17 ½ months since inception, Portfolio
    A1 has posted a cumulative return (exclusive of dividends) of 14.6%, while the
    benchmark S&P 500 index has declined 12.9%.  This adds up to a net performance
    of +27.5% for the portfolio vs. the benchmark.

    W&T Offshore ([WTI](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=wti)); DreamWorks Animation
    ([DWA](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=dwa)); Synaptics ([SYNA](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=syna));
    and Hugoton Royalty Trust ([HGT](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=hgt)). For
    the record, Portfolio A1 also shares some common ancestry and has a stock ranking
    system that is similar to the VIX and More Focus Aggressive Trader model portfolio
    – one of the four model portfolios that I update transaction by transaction for
    the VIX and More [subscriber newsletter](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/subscriber%20newsletter).'
