- en: Small changes in the input assumptions often lead to very different efficient
    portfolios constructed with mean-variance optimization. I will discuss Resampling
    and Covariance Shrinkage Estimator – two common techniques to make portfolios
    in the mean-variance efficient frontier more diversified and immune to small changes
    in the input assumptions.

    Here is the Abstract:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[The central message of this paper is that nobody should be using the sample
    covariance matrix for the purpose of portfolio optimization. It contains estimation
    error of the kind most likely to perturb a mean-variance optimizer. In its place,
    we suggest using the matrix obtained from the sample covariance matrix through
    a transformation called shrinkage. This tends to pull the most extreme coefficients
    towards more central values, thereby systematically reducing estimation error
    where it matters most. Statistically, the challenge is to know the optimal shrinkage
    intensity, and we give the formula for that. Without changing any other step in
    the portfolio optimization process, we show on actual stock market data that shrinkage
    reduces tracking error relative to a benchmark index, and substantially increases
    the realized information ratio of the active portfolio manager.](http://www.ledoit.net/honey_abstract.htm)'

    to-wards the structured estimator. The Shrinkage Target, F, is modeled by constant
    correlation model. The model says that all the (pairwise) correlations are identical.
    The average of all the sample correlations is the estimator of the common constant
    correlation.

    is beneficial.

    out-of-sample returns. However, these methods will surely reduce portfolio turnover
    and transaction cost associated with rebalancing by making portfolios on efficient
    frontier immune to small changes in the input assumptions.
