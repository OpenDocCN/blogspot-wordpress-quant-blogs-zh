    usually provide more important signals than confirmations.  For instance, if a
    company reports good news and sells off, then that action speaks louder than if
    the stock had bounced on the news (not withstanding all the “buy on the rumor,
    sell on the news” lore.)  The same is true for broad market data and the broader
    indices.  To my mind, these are fundamental failures.'

- en: There is an analogous situation with technical analysis.  A failure in this
    context could be a stock or index that has consistently bounced off of a particular
    support level that now violates that support and continues lower.  I believe that
    these TA failures speak volumes more in terms of informational content than if
    support had held for the n+1^(th) time.

- en: 'Which brings us to yesterday.  Two measures in particular suggested that market
    sentiment was so strongly negative as to make a bounce a high probability event:
    the [ISEE](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/ISEE) had just hit a new
    low in its 20 day SMA and the [NASDAQ TRIN](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/02/bullish-nasdaq-trin-signal.html)
    (30 day EMA) had spiked to levels not seen since 2002.  The bottom line is that
    it a bounce should have been like shooting fish in a barrel for the bulls.  Since
    the bulls could neither hold onto their gains, nor put a dent in the selloff that
    ensued, I am forced to conclude that in the course of this substantial sentiment
    failure, they didn’t even graze any of the fish.  I am also changing my bias to
    bearish until the bulls can demonstrate a modicum of marksmanship…'
