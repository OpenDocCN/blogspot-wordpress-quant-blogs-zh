    left open an important question: how to choose an appropriate hedge instrument,
    especially amongst several alternatives. Prior to diving into full exploratory
    data analysis for proxy hedging (in a forthcoming post), this question is worth
    careful consideration.'

    Measure theory would incorporate [almost sure equality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_variable#Almost_sure_equality).
    Yet, the ideal proxy conceptually demands more than both; it demands *equality
    in empirical distribution*. Hence, any prospective solution must be framed in
    terms of both empirical samples and the *entire* distribution of both ![u](img/3e3dc85b695f49b6073b5656627101bb.png)

    to the linear ![\beta](img/e59dd600f7eb22f952e355797bceba2e.png) scaling. Now,
    the question boils down to evaluating distributional equality while ignoring ![\beta](img/e59dd600f7eb22f952e355797bceba2e.png).
    For this, we appeal to quantile analysis (previously discussed in the context
    of [stability](https://quantivity.wordpress.com/2009/08/03/stability-by-quantile/),
    and nicely exemplified in research by [Koenker](http://www.econ.uiuc.edu/~roger/)).
    Specifically, use of [quantile-quantile (QQ) plot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-Q_plot).

    and ![D(h)](img/3f48c4ff989afad3618c3678cd835c62.png), rather than traditional
    comparison between theoretical and empirical. Thus, the plot illustrates the desired
    visualization of empirical distributional similarity. Most importantly, the ![\beta](img/e59dd600f7eb22f952e355797bceba2e.png)
    scaling disappears due to measurement in units of quantile. Further, this approach
    is non-parametric, obviating the need to posit distributional assumptions on either
    instrument.
