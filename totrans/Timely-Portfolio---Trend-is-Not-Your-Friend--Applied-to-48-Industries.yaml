    reader vonjd very helpfully referred me to this paper [The Trend is Not Your Friend!
    Why Empirical Timing Success is Determined by the Underlying’s Price Characteristics
    and Market Efficiency is Irrelevant](http://www.frankfurt-school.de/clicnetclm/fileDownload.do?goid=000000311260AB4)
    by Peter Scholz and Ursula Walther. The authors conclude

    asset price characteristics of the underlying price process have a crucial impact
    on timing results. This allows us to forecast the timing success depending on
    the market's parameters. An OLS

    of the relevance of the most important price process parameters. As a result,
    the traditional explanations for timing success can be abandoned: we find that
    it is very likely for the SMA trading rule to generate excess returns over its
    benchmark if the underlying price path exhibits negative drifts, high serial autocorrelation,
    low volatilities of returns, and highly clustered volatilities. Drift and autocorrelation
    of the underlying asset seem to have the largest impact, though.”'

    larger set of indexes over a longer period of time.  As I was working on [48 Industries
    Since 1963](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2012/08/48-industries-since-1963.html),
    I decided 50 years of data on 48 different indexes would be a great dataset to
    apply the ideas and methods presented in the paper.

    Let’s see if we can test “drift and autocorrelation…have the largest impact” on
    excess returns with industries also.  I’ll try not to get too statistical.

    between return and out(under)performance of the 200 day moving average system,
    so the better the performance of the industry, the less likely a moving average
    system is to outperform.

    chart will best start our exploration.  Lines are colored by the excess return
    of a moving average system on each industry.

    system to outperform.  Let’s isolate our chart to mu and alpha1 and add ar1 based
    on the authors’ findings.  I am very tempted to try to explain GARCH here, but
    for the sake of brevity, I’ll refrain.  This [paper](http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1570505569310094643&hl=en&as_sdt=0,1)
    and this [Portfolio Probe post](http://www.portfolioprobe.com/2012/07/06/a-practical-introduction-to-garch-modeling/)
    offer a good introduction to GARCH.

    starting with those with the most influence.

    to US industry indexes.  In future posts, I’ll add a little more statistical rigor
    to the analysis and apply to other indexes.

    excess returns of a moving average system over buy and hold.  As you can see,
    a bull market favors buy and hold.  The 70s and 2008-2009 were very kind to a
    moving average approach.
