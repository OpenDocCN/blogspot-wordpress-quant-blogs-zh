# Humble Student of the Markets: Asset inflation, here we come!

I see that central bankers really haven’t figured out this “bubble” thing. The deputy governor of the Bank of Canada recently stated that the

[Bank of Canada won't raise interest rates to cool housing](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/bank-of-canada-wont-raise-interest-rates-to-cool-housing/article1427298/)

:

> “Some observers – those who see a housing bubble forming – have said that since low interest rates have stimulated housing market activity, the Bank should now raise interest rates to dampen that activity,” deputy governor Timothy Lane wrote in a speech delivered by an adviser on his behalf in Edmonton. “But that poses a problem.”

> 
> Those who fear a bubble worry that many people are taking advantage of cheap money to buy homes they wouldn't be able to afford once rates rise, leading ultimately to a crash in prices.

> Mr. Lane said the bank understands the concern, but it uses its lending rate to keep inflation in check for the whole economy and the housing market is “only one of several factors” that influence inflation.

> Instead, he said, the government could increase capital requirements for lending institutions, adjust loan-to-value ratios and change the terms and conditions required to obtain mandatory mortgage insurance.

Lane’s remarks are reminiscent of

[Ben Bernanke’s speech at the AEA](http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20100103a.htm)

in which he absolved the Fed’s role in the last bubble. This has prompted comments such this one,

[the Fed missed this bubble, will it see a new one](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/06/business/economy/06leonhardt.html)

?

Central bankers seem to stuck with the concept of inflation as it existed in the 1970’s, where a vicious feedback loop created a self-reinforcing cycle of inflation. In my previous post

[what kind of inflation?](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2009/10/what-kind-of-inflation_26.html)

I believe that this next round of inflation is likely to show up as asset inflation, which primarily manifests itself in commodity prices.

**What party?**

If the role of central bankers is to take away the punch bowl just as the party gets going, the Bank of Canada has now abdicated that responsibility to the party's host (the government). By contrast, Bernanke's response has been "what party?"

Asset inflation, here we come!
