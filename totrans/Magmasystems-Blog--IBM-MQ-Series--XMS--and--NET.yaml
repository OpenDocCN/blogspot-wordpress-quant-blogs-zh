    out over IBM MQ. There is a messaging implementation from IBM called XMS that
    seems like it's JMS over MQ. This is great for us because this means that we can
    (hopefully) clone our existing Tibco EMS adapters, and with a few little changes,
    be able to read off of MQ.

    does have to use XMS in order for us to consume through XMS, then we will need
    to come up with an input adapter that uses the native MQ API.
