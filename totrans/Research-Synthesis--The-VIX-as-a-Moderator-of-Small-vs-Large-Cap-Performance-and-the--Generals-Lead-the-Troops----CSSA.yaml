    are both good—sort of a chocolate and peanut butter kind of thing. In this case,
    the relationship between the S&P500 and the Russell2000 is interesting because
    it captures the lead/lag autocorrelation effect documented in the academic literature.
    In addition it also  captures the difference in risk premium to holding large
    diversified companies that are more heavily tied to economic factors versus smaller
    and more concentrated companies that have: 1) less sensitivity to economic factors
    most of the time, but more stock-specific risk 2) a high sensitivity under times
    of extreme stress–generally due to higher credit risk. Nonetheless, the explanantion
    and theory is a subject for another day (or another blog), my goal is to show
    that there is a synergistic effect by combining both. In the MarketSci post (see
    link above), a strategy was introduced that showed that the S&P500 tended to outperform
    when the 12-month or 1-year return was higher than the Russell2000 index. This
    phenomenon was labelled as the “Generals Leading the Troops.” This strategy did
    better   with less risk and less exposure than a standard buy and hold strategy.
    In the link above from CXO Advisory they review a paper by Dean Leistikow and
    Susana Yu who tested the significance of the relative VIX level as a signal for
    short-term switching between the Russell2000 (small-cap) and the S&P500 (large-cap)
    stock indexes. They found that the S&P500 outperformed the Russell2000 when the
    VIX was high, and underperformed when the VIX was low. These high/low levels were
    identified as being within 10-20% above or below the 75-day moving average of
    the VIX.'

    these two separate findings work together. In terms of methodology: I used the
    S&P500 and Russell2000 index prices from Yahoo Finance to increase the sample
    size of the dataset. I defined relative outperformance for the relative strength
    strategy as the 252 day return of the S&P500 being greater than(less than) the
    252 day return of the Russell2000\. For the VIX, I used the 75-day sma mentioned
    in the article, and decided to split the difference of 10-20% as being either
    15% above or below the sma. Lets look at the results for each strategy in isolation,
    and in combination.'

- en: 'Conclusions: The results for combining the two studies showed  higher absolute
    and risk-adjusted performance  than either study individually over most categories.
    It appears that the dual screen of relative strength and relative VIX are more
    powerful together than in isolation. On the positive side, when the S&P was leading
    the Russell and the VIX was high, the S&P had by far its best performance in absolute
    and risk-adjusted terms. On the opposite side, when the Russell was leading the
    S&P and the VIX was low, the S&P put in its worst performance in absolute and
    risk-adjusted terms. As a third note, the S&P performed well when the VIX was
    low and the S&P was outperforming the Russell. While not shown for brevity’s sake,
    it is clear that the S&P underperforms buy and hold in the “normal” VIX environment
    (1.15>VIX/sma>.85) regardless of whether it is leading or lagging. Creating long
    and long/short strategies based on these regimes is a subject for a future post.'
