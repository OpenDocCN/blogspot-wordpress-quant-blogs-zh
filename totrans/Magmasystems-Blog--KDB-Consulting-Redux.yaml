    been intrigued about my posts about KDB+, and wanting to know how to be a KDB+
    consultant. It may be easier to apply to medical school and become a heart surgeon
    than it is to bootstrap yourself in a KDB consulting career.

    to me as the key to future riches. All I do is observe the marketplace. I deal
    alot in hiring people for our own needs, and I get a lot of calls from recruiters.
    I have a lot of colleagues on Wall Street and in The City. So I am able to gather
    a lot of different data points, some of which I share on this blog.

    coding areas. Grab a copy of "Q for Mortals" by Jeff Borror. Find the pockets
    of KDB people in your company and get them to explain their source code for you.

    you cannot go onto LimeWire or Kazaa and find a copy of KDB floating around. Even
    if you did, you need to find a license key.

    about how you will convince Niall Dalton or Simon Garland to let you play around
    with KDB. Or, wait for the next SIFMA conference, find the KDB booth, and offer
    to take the KDB guys to the lounge at the Hilton. Or, come up with a product that
    might compliment KDB (like Panopticon did) and try to show Simon that it will
    increase the popularity of KDB. Maybe an English-to-Q translator? Maybe a true
    ODBC driver for KDB? Maybe a Q code obsfuscator?

    for KX Systems, and the Yin to KX Systems' Yang. Hint .. they love Guiness.

- en: Lest you think that I am picking on KDB ... the same thing can apply to any
    niche product. I suppose that you would not be able to wake up one day and decide
    that you will be a Vhayu consultant. In order to specialize in any kind of niche
    product, you need to leverage the existing resources for that product. This is
    one of the advantages of being employees of large financial firms or large consulting
    firms that specialize in financial services.

- en: You need to get yourself into the proper mindset to deal with KDB. It is a very
    spartan product, hand-tuned and lightning fast at processing real-time flows of
    tick and order data. The actual Q.exe engine is about a 150K file. You do not
    get any of the nice, cushy bloat that you have with something like SQL Server
    and Oracle. Working with KDB brings you back to the days when you were writing
    DOS TSRs using good old INT 21H (for those of you born after 1980, a TSR is a
    Terminate and Stay Resident program .... and DOS was an ancient operating system
    that made Microsoft lots of money).

    called holiday.q. Once you understand this code, send email to Niall or Simon
    of KX Systems, or to the people at First Derivatives, and show them that you can
    write this stuff without even looking (and this is mild ... wait until you get
    into the juicy stuff).
