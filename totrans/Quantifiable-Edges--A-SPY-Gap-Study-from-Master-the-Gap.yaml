- en: 'the other day and learned that he is currently offering a detailed study on
    SPY gaps on his website. The study is free and available for the next few days.
    When I last saw Scott in February at the New York Traders Expo he presented some
    of the information in this study at his seminar. I saw that seminar, and I''ve
    reviewed the study that is currently being offered, and there is a lot of information
    that quant-oriented traders may find useful. Therefore I have posted a link below
    to Scott''s site where you can download this SPY study. If you''re interested
    at all in trading gaps then I would suggest checking it out. It does contain a
    lot of good information.  It''s about 30-pages of tables and bullet points looking
    at SPY gaps from many different angles.  I believe he often charges for similar
    studies.  Anyway, here''s the link:'

- en: 'Full disclosure: 1) Scott is a friend of mine. 2) When you go to download the
    study it will ask you where you heard about it. Quantifiable Edges is one of the
    drop-down choices. I''m simply letting you know this so you''re not surprised.
    I am not receiving any compensation from Scott for doing this and have no formal
    business relationship with him (though he did contribute a section to the Quantifiable
    Edges Guide to Fed Days book). I''m doing it both because I feel the study is
    good, and that Quantifiable Edges readers may find value in it. Of course if enough
    people choose the Quantifiable Edges drop-down then I will definitely bully him
    into buying me a beer next time I see him.'
