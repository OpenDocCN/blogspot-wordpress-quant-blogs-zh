    upgraded to bullish from bearish. In the US, the SPX has recovered and exceeded
    its 50 day moving average (dma). European bourses have strengthened and Asian
    markets, led by Shanghai and Hong Kong, have been on fire. These are the classic
    signs of a global bull trend.

- en: I remain skeptical. Recent experience has shown that US equity prices has shown
    the tendency to reverse itself. As the chart below shows, the market has done
    the stutter-step and crossed the 50 dma, which is a reasonable proxy for a medium
    term trend, a total of 13 times in 2015, compared to only four times in the same
    period in 2014\. By last Friday, the market was either overbought or mildly overbought
    on the 5 and 14 day RSI (top two panels) and at levels where rallies have petered
    out. At the same time, the VIX Index, which tends to be inversely correlated to
    the market, is now testing a key support level where it has stopped declining

    up more or less in a straight line since 2012, with few drawdowns. By contrast,
    2011 saw a reversal of the upward price trend from the 2009 bottom as it grappled

- en: Paulsen went on to calculate the rolling 3-year R-squared, which measures the
    fit of a trend-line, of the market and showed how it had up and down cycles. When
    the fit is too good, it can breed investor complacency and the stock prices ultimately
    reverse themselves. In other words, we may be on the verge of an intermediate

- en: I was sufficiently intrigued by the Paulsen study that I downloaded month-end
    SPX prices going back to 1950 from Yahoo Finance to reproduced the results and
    add some of my own insights. As the top panel of the chart below shows, the rolling
    36-month R-squared reached an astounding 0.976 at the end of March 2015\. This
    was the second highest reading in its history, only to be exceeded by an episode

- en: The bottom panel of the chart shows the difference between the rolling 36-month

    that the long-term trend is much stronger than the short-term trend and when the
    reading is low, the short-term trend is much stronger than the long-term trend.

    to stock prices when the 36-month R-Squared first exceed 0.95, which occurred
    last year in June 2014\. While the sample size is small, it does give us a rough
    roadmap as to what happens next. Stock prices continued to rise initially because
    of the powerful momentum underlying the long-term trend. They then peak out at
    between 6-12 months, and the decline bottoms out at around 18 months afterwards.

- en: While the number of data points in this study is very small and therefore confidence
    is low, let me try to torture the data a little further so that it talks. As the
    36-month R-squared is 0.976, or the second highest level in its history, I looked
    at what happened when R-squared was above 0.97\. The data points only fell by
    one (N=3) and the results are instructive. The market decline started almost right
    away, followed by a rally and a fall into the ultimate low in 18 months.
