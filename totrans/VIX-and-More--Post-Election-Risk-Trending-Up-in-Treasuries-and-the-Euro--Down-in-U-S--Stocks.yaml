    side of the trade.  “The VIX is broken!” becomes an oft-repeated refrain, as does
    “The markets are rigged!” and the usual list of exhortations from those who are
    in denial.  The current line of thinking is that the world must be much more dangerous,
    risky and uncertain as a result of a Trump victory, yet the VIX is actually down
    31.4% since the election – ipso facto the VIX is broken.

    the first to point that taking an Americentric, equity-centric view of the investment
    landscape is dangerous and naïve.  More often than not, the issues that end up
    having a strong influence on the VIX are born on foreign soil and/or in other
    asset classes.  Just look at the recent history in

- en: In aggregate, the picture is a mixed one in terms of implied volatility, risk
    and uncertainty.  As is often the case, risk has become elevated in certain asset
    classes, such as Treasuries and the euro.  In other areas, such as U.S. equities
    – and their VIXian barometer – there are winners and losers, with the result that
    a net bullish outlook has moved equity implied volatility lower.  This is not
    to say that a Trump Administration – whose cabinet members and policy priorities
    are largely unknown at this juncture – will not increase risk in some areas. 
    More risk is certainly on the horizon and if history is any guide, an Americentric,
    equity-centric view of the investment world is likely to be slow in identifying
    those risks.
