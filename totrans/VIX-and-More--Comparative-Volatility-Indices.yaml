    US volatility indices](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/03/meet-spikers_16.html):
    VIX, [VXO](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXO), [VXN](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXN),
    [RVX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/RVX), and [VXD](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXD).  The
    chart, which comes courtesy of [BigCharts](http://bigcharts.marketwatch.com/),
    shows that over the past six months, the difference between the volatility indices
    are no more than subtle nuances.  Keep in mind that during this period, the financial
    sector was extremely hard hit.  Moreover, financials are overrepresented in the
    VIX and VXO, underrepresented in the RVX, and absent from the VXN.  The sector
    distinction is all but lost in the charts (except perhaps from mid-February to
    mid-March) and if there were ever a time for the indices to diverge in a meaningful
    way, this was it.'

    only the VIX.  Volatility aficionados may also choose to follow the VXN, but after
    adding a second volatility index to one’s radar, the incremental return on effort
    and complexity diminishes rapidly.

    to point these out, but for the most part, expect my comments about the VIX to
    apply to the entire volatility index family tree as a whole.
