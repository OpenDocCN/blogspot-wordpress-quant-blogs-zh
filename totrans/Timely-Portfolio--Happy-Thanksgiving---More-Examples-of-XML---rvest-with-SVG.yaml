    code builds nicely on the XML + rvest combination (also see yesterday’s [post](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2014/11/slightly-advanced-rvest-with-help-from_26.html))
    for working with XML/HTML/SVG documents in R.

- en: It all started when I was playing on my iPhone in the [Sketchbook app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/autodesk-sketchbook/id883738213?mt=8)
    and drew a really bad turkey.  Even though, the turkey was bad, I thought it would
    be fun to combine with [vivus.js](http://maxwellito.github.io/vivus/).  However,
    Sketchbook does not export SVG, so I exported as PDF and imported into [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org). 
    The end result was a still very messy SVG file, so I thought it would be a great
    test / application of my new skills with `[rvest](http://blog.rstudio.org/2014/11/24/rvest-easy-web-scraping-with-r/)`
    + `[XML](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1461478995/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1461478995&linkCode=as2&tag=timelyp-20&linkId=FZJTULMKOUP5KIXE)`.
    The code opens the SVG, grabs all the `path` nodes, assembles those into a `svg`
    tag with id = "turkey", and then adds a script to use the `addDependency` for
    vivus.js.
