# Quantifiable Edges: Sometimes Overbought Suggests More Strength

When the market begins to get overbought it will often suggest a pullback is likely.  When overbought gets powered through then odds will sometimes shift from a pullback to a continuation of that move.  The last two nights I have seen some studies suggesting this scenario.  The study below is on that I have showed a few times in the past.  All stats are updated.

These results appear to suggest a pretty consistent upside edge over the next 1-3 weeks.  In fact, below is a profit curve showing just how consistent it has been over the years using a 10-day exit.

That's an impressive upslope for a period covering over 50 years.
