    Later this week we will be returning to the all-important subject of equity curve
    management–and this topic will guide much of the theory.  Unfortunately I am well
    aware that traders tend to ignore long theoretical tomes because they are so focused
    on the “bottom line.”  Backtests and pretty charts are no doubt more interesting
    in a world of twitter and 20-second attention spans. However, understanding a
    few key ideas will save you hours of random backtesting and help improve your
    systems dramatically. While I would like to broaden the scope of this blog, I
    felt that an indicator provides a more tangible/practical example of how to apply
    general knowledge.

    of returns or prices.  Today we will look at one of these terms. Skewness is a
    way of looking at where the average of the distribution is positioned relative
    to the median  in standardized terms. In effect it tells us how the magnitude
    of observations is distributed in relation to frequency. If the average is greater
    than the median, then basically the distribution is weighted to the right hand
    side and to create unnecessary confusion this is referred to as negative skew
    (despite the fact that most people would think it was positive skew intuitively).
    Conversely if the average is less than the median then the distribution is weighted
    to the left hand side and this is known as positive skew. Basically we want to
    see a negatively skewed distribution since mathematically this will mean that
    we have a greater than 50% chance of a given return, with the average return being
    higher than most of the observed returns.

    current conditions remind us all, mean-reversion indicators function more reliably
    on the long side in either up-trends, or in stable but volatile conditions.  The
    problem is that the moving averages of price are too long to be reliable for short-term
    indicators. What we really want is something that can tell us if the odds are
    shifting in our favor–especially on the long side where most of the risk-adjusted
    returns in the market are made. It makes sense to therefore look at whether the
    short-term price history exhibits negative skewness. For this version, I used
    the sample skewness function in excel denoted as =SKEW(). I will save the calculations
    for a follow up post or a link to a spreadsheet. This example compares a standard
    2-day (H,L,C) stochastic to the 2-day skewness stochastic at various levels on
    the SPY over the last 2000 bars. As you can clearly see, the skewness stochastic
    has substantially higher accuracy/reliability and lower downside risk. More to
    follow……….
