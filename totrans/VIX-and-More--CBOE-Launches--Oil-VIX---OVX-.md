# VIX and More: CBOE Launches "Oil VIX" (OVX)

Today the CBOE [launched](http://cboe.com/AboutCBOE/ShowDocument.aspx?DIR=ACNews&FILE=cboe_20080714.doc&CreateDate=14.07.2008) an "Oil VIX" ([OVX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/OVX)) based on options on the [USO](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/USO) crude oil ETF.

According to the CBOE [press release](http://cboe.com/AboutCBOE/ShowDocument.aspx?DIR=ACNews&FILE=cboe_20080714.doc&CreateDate=14.07.2008), the exchange is in the process of expanding their volatility index product line into commodities and foreign currencies.

I think this is an exciting development that just happens to fit nicely with several chapters in my upcoming book.

I'll have a lot more to say about the OVX and other CBOE volatility products going forward.
