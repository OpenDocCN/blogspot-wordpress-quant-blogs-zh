    and deftly landed an upercut that sent Lesnar to the ground (for some reason,
    applying g-forces directly to the jaw causes one's brain to momentarily reset).
    Then, Carwin reigned down shots, but couldn't get a clean enough blow to finish
    him. In the second period, Carwin again landed some good shots, but then Lesnar
    took Carwin down with a double leg, and went to work. He went for an arm triangle
    choke, which is a great move for a wrestler because it plays into their strength
    in knowing how to torque the neck when going for a pin (note that 3 time NCAA
    champ Jake Rosholt applied the same move to

    strategy space is large, necessitating skills in boxing, wrestling, and jiu-jitsu.
    This makes it fun to watch. Several champions have undergraduate degrees in real

    can get beat because no one is best at all three (wrestling, striking, jiu-jitsu),
    and any one of these skills can be decisive if you don't defend it intelligently.
    It's a relatively cognitively demanding sport.

    Times still give it pretty short shrift in their coverage. ESPN's coverage is
    growing, but they still hold on to boxing which is relatively boring (and, any
    MMA fighter would dispatch quickly by simply taking him off his feet).
