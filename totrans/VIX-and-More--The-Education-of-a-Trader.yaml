    The Option Traders Journal](http://www.expiringmonthly.com/), on the back page
    of the magazine, where the authors are encouraged to be tangential and irreverent.
    I thought I would share it because of the positive feedback I received from a
    number of readers and because I think this piece dovetails nicely with the collection
    of links below.]*'

    a complex issue, would acquire a look on their faces somewhere between consternation
    and dread, immediately thrust a waving hand up into the air and blurt out in a
    worried voice, “Do we have to know this for the test?” I can be fairly sure that
    none of these people ended up as successful traders.

    to get a sense of the evolution of thinking about how to develop a successful
    trader. For many years, the model for aspiring traders was considered to be a
    genteel Ivy League education. Over time, Wall Street firms began to favor graduates
    with a more humble socioeconomic pedigree who were considered hungry, hard working
    and highly motivated to prove something to the world. In more recent years, we
    have seen Wall Street seek out physicists and those with exceptional quantitative
    skills. Lately, a desire for poker skills has also come into play.

    readings, homework assignments or even a syllabus with recommendations. Tests
    are administered on a daily basis, frequently with multiple tests on the same
    day. Worst of all, everyone is graded on an unfavorable curve in which there are
    more Fs than As.

    more. An insatiable curiosity helps, as does a willingness to explore unfamiliar
    territory. Great trades, insights and strategies present themselves in somewhat
    random fashion and, as Louis Pasteur observed, “Chance favors the prepared mind.”

    hours of experience is a prerequisite for greatness in almost any field. In a
    normal career, that level of commitment usually translates to five years, but
    on Wall Street, 10,000 hours of experience can be crammed into 3–4 years. Of course,
    all hours are not created equal. A trader’s capacity to distinguish between random
    events and meaningful patterns is important to establish a solid trajectory of
    growth and development.

    My formal schooling consisted of an undergraduate degree in political science
    and a traditional MBA program. After two decades of business strategy consulting
    experience deeply rooted in fundamental analysis, I was ill-equipped to excel
    in a short-term trading time frame. In order to embrace technical analysis, I
    first had to jettison my fundamental perspective on investments and build a new
    foundation based on technical analysis and market sentiment.

    process to be a lifelong endeavor, crossing as many multi-disciplinary boundaries
    as can be digested. In a way, I like to think of the foundation of trading success
    as building a large idea stew and developing an eye for spotting high potential
    new ideas. The trick is to have the right breadth and depth of knowledge so that
    when one stumbles on the next great strategy, it can be easily identified, captured
    and developed. Call it opportunistic research and development, if you will.

    are based on areas in which I had limited knowledge when I first encountered them.
    No matter how well things are going, I take the approach that I never have the
    luxury of being satisfied with the status quo and need to embrace the idea of
    getting out of my comfort zone. In trading and in life, it pays to constantly
    refresh the pipeline of new ideas and continue to tinker with them, because you
    never know what will be on tomorrow’s test.
