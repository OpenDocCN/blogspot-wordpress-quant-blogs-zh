About the time when this market downdraft began, I wrote a post on

Given the weak action of the broader NYSE Composite, my best guess is that support materializes closer to 1040, which also coincides with the February lows. If the market does descends to those levels, how will market participants react should we approach those price zones?

More telling, a recent

saw an incredible 38% of respondents believing that the Dow could go to 5,000, which represents a further 50% haircut from current levels:

Does this sound like panic? Even though you may be a bear, do you believe that markets go up or down in a straight line?

The ferocity and intensity of this move has surprised a bear like me. The stock market is

and now trading at an intermediate term support zone. My inner trader tells me to get ready for a short sharp rally before re-entering on the short side.
