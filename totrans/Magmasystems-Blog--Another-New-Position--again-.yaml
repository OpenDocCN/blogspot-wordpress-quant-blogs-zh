    desk when an amazing opportunity was offered to me by my company. I cannot blog
    too much about this new opportunity other to say that it involves Complex Event
    Processing and transformational new directions for trading and decision making
    in Equities. This is a huge initiative for my company, is being sponsored by the
    top people on the business side in Equities, and goes all the way up to the CEO
    of the company. I will be leading this new project on the technical end, and I
    am working with one of the movers-and-shakers on the business end.

    case for vendors like Apama, Skyler, etc. We will be pushing the limits of the
    CEP and messaging vendors. We have the mandate to have all of our Equities systems
    interact with our. And, if everything goes right, it will transform the way that
    systems are written within our company.

    time. Reading papers, attending conferences, meeting vendors, etc. For me, it
    is coming out of a silo and being given the opportunity to learn about every phase
    of our systems for trading equities. And, it will be building upon all of the
    things that I have been investigating for the past year in my Architecture role.
