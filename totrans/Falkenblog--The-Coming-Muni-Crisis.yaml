- en: 'about state shortfalls in tax revenues, because of lower home sales, high gas
    prices. My city makes about 75% of its revenues from property tax assessments.
    Every year I have been here they would go up 7% a year, in addition to all the
    new houses being built. This year, it actually assessed me at a 7% decrease, and
    house construction in my city came to a halt. Now, this was assessed in March
    2008, and is for taxes payable in 2009, which are paid in March and September.
    As my city had a heck of a time cutting 2% off a projected increase of 5%, I wonder
    what they will do if revenues actually decline? I imagine they will borrow in
    the short run but that isn''t a long term solution because the 7% valuation is
    permanent: they aren''t going to raise my assessment 14% next year because yearly
    assessment increases are capped at 8%.'

  zh: 关于税收收入短缺的情况，因为房屋销售减少，油价高。我的城市大约75%的收入来自房产税评估。我在这里的每一年，他们的增长率都要增长7%，另外还有新建的房屋。今年，它实际上对我评估为减少了7%，而我所在的城市的房屋建设停止了。现在，这是在2008年3月评估的，是2009年要交税的，分别是三月和九月。由于我所在的城市在预期的增长5%中削减了2%，他们如若实际的收入下降，我想知道他们会怎么办？我想他们会短期内借钱，但这不是长期的解决方案，因为7%的评估是永久的：他们不会在明年将我的评估提高14%，因为年度的评估增长率被限制在8%。
- en: I imagine lots of cities will have this problem, and they won't do anything
    prior to a crisis, because all their money has interest groups that won't let
    them. The key trigger event for bankruptcy is not recognizing you have a failed
    business model, but rather, having a failed business model AND running out of
    cash, because at that point outsiders won't lend to you. Cities seem to increase
    expenditures as if they don't have to face the vagaries of business, but that
    was before the housing crisis. I haven't heard any peeps yet, but next year at
    this time, everyone will be howling. And I'm sure some cities will default. After
    all, the biggest housing decline in 30 years will catch more than just Wall Street
    off guard, but those humble public servants as well. Right now, it's best not
    to think of it.

  zh: 我想很多城市都会面临这个问题，他们不会在危机爆发之前采取任何行动，因为他们所有的资金都受到不愿放手的利益团体的影响。破产的关键触发事件不是意识到你有一个失败的商业模式，而是拥有一个失败的商业模式并且现金用尽，因为此时外部人员不会借钱给你。城市似乎增加支出，好像他们不必面对商业的变幻莫测，但这是在房地产危机之前的事情。我还没有听到任何吱声，但明年这个时候，每个人都会嚎叫。而且我相信一些城市会违约。毕竟，30年来最大的房地产下跌将会让不仅仅是华尔街，还有那些谦恭的公务员倍感措手不及。现在最好不要去想这些。
