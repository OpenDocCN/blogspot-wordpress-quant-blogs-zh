- en: 'about state shortfalls in tax revenues, because of lower home sales, high gas
    prices. My city makes about 75% of its revenues from property tax assessments.
    Every year I have been here they would go up 7% a year, in addition to all the
    new houses being built. This year, it actually assessed me at a 7% decrease, and
    house construction in my city came to a halt. Now, this was assessed in March
    2008, and is for taxes payable in 2009, which are paid in March and September.
    As my city had a heck of a time cutting 2% off a projected increase of 5%, I wonder
    what they will do if revenues actually decline? I imagine they will borrow in
    the short run but that isn''t a long term solution because the 7% valuation is
    permanent: they aren''t going to raise my assessment 14% next year because yearly
    assessment increases are capped at 8%.'

- en: I imagine lots of cities will have this problem, and they won't do anything
    prior to a crisis, because all their money has interest groups that won't let
    them. The key trigger event for bankruptcy is not recognizing you have a failed
    business model, but rather, having a failed business model AND running out of
    cash, because at that point outsiders won't lend to you. Cities seem to increase
    expenditures as if they don't have to face the vagaries of business, but that
    was before the housing crisis. I haven't heard any peeps yet, but next year at
    this time, everyone will be howling. And I'm sure some cities will default. After
    all, the biggest housing decline in 30 years will catch more than just Wall Street
    off guard, but those humble public servants as well. Right now, it's best not
    to think of it.
