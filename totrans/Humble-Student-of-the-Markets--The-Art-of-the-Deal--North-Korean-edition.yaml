    nuclear tests? After the hoopla over the North Korean announcement to expect a
    major event on or before their "Day of the Sun" on April 15, there was much speculation
    that they would conduct another nuclear test. Trump responded with the assertion
    that if China wouldn't help, he would deal with North Korea by himself. The aircraft
    carrier USS Carl Vinson was re-routed from a planned exercise with Australia to
    the North Pacific.

    splash was the display of some submarine launched ballistic missiles that were
    mounted on trucks in the annual parade. Afterwards, North Korea tried a missile
    test, but it blew up shortly after launch. Even

- en: Japanese analysts believe that the USS Carl Vinson’s change of course is designed
    to fill a strategic vacuum in US forces at the present moment. “Since the nuclear
    aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan, which is based at Yokosuka Naval Base [in
    Japan], is inactive from January to April because of inspections and repairs,
    [the USS Carl Vinson] was deployed to fill a gap [in the West Pacific region],”
    wrote Tetsuro Kosaka, a staff writer for the Nihon Keizai Shinbun and an expert
    on Japanese security, in a column for the newspaper on Apr. 11\. Though the USS
    Carl Vinson is in charge of the East Pacific, the fact that it is heading toward
    the Korean Peninsula (located in the West Pacific) cannot be regarded as an increased
    American military presence in the region, he argued.

    at the moment. North Korea should not think that it has once again broken through
    the pressure from the global community. If it continues to go its own way, sanctions
    from the international community will become more stringent and the US will seriously
    consider launching military strikes against it. If conflict does break out, Pyongyang
    will suffer the most.

    Monday, it is well worth considering how Donald Trump, who considers himself to
    be a master dealmaker, can find an accommodation with North Korea. Unfortunately,
    there aren't any good deals to be found.
