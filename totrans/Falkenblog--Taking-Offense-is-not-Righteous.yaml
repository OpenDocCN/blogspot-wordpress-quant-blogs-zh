    events. In the study the subjects had a scar applied to their face with makeup,
    which they observed in a mirror. They were told that they were going to have a
    discussion with another person, and that the experimenter was interested in whether
    the other person's behavior would be affected by the subject's scar. The subject
    was instructed to note any behavior that they thought was a reaction to the scar.
    At the last moment the experimented said he had to moisturize the scar to prevent
    it from cracking, and then surreptitiously removed the scar.

    you should see that every statement, action and reaction of another human being
    as the sum result of their total life experience to date, and so it really has
    very little to do with you. To the extent they are implying you are a knave, fool,
    or tool, it usually has more to do with them than you, especially in contacts
    with people one doesn't really know (eg, cops, waiters, teachers).

    own built-in reactions. When we provide no Velcro for it to stick, something changes
    in the world, and most importantly, you aren't brought down thinking about the
    implications of some poorly thought-out actions.  Contemplating or correcting
    those with bad thoughts is like staying up late trying to make sure no one is
    wrong on the internet. Though it may take a lifetime of practice, a thick skin
    is truly one of the best kept secrets for living a happy life.

    whatever angle gives them their greatest insecurity or platform, which somehow
    will bring justice to the world. It's really a bad meme, counterproductive for
