    the head of a bull. Such a creature provided the inspiration for a pairs trade

    calls and long VIX at-the-money calls.

    on, see how it develops and get a sense of some of the potential hurdles. I fully
    understand that the results will not be statistically significant and making any
    inferences about a strategy from one trade is dangerous, but I do find some value
    in what I call these “proof-of-concept” trades with real money.

    goal. With a proof-of-concept trade, profits are important, but so is information.
    For this reason, I have a tendency to leave proof-of-concept trades on longer
    than I would when trading with an established strategy.

    just under 49% of the VXX at the moment and my research indicates that VXX generally
    moves about 48% as much as the VIX on a daily basis, so with the VIX at about
    22 and VXX at about 45, I elect to do this pairs trade on a 1:1 ratio basis, using
    10 contracts of each to keep the math simple.

- en: In a world of maximum profitability, I would probably wait for some sort of
    relatively high VIX level before entering this trade, but because I am also focusing
    on the informational value of the trade, I choose to open the position early in
    the trading day on November 22^(nd), with the VIX at about the middle of its 10-day
    range.

- en: With the VIX at 22.03 and VXX at 44.98, there is a strong temptation to stay
    strictly at the money and short the VXX December 45 calls while going long the
    VIX December 22 calls. For ten contracts, the potential profit should both options
    expire worthless is less than $1000\. Given my expectations for seasonally low
    volatility and also given the high level of contango in the VIX futures, I elect
    to shave the odds a little and short the slightly in-the-money VXX December 44
    calls and go long the VIX December 22 calls. This raises the potential profit
    if both options expire worthless by another $200\. After trying to work the order
    a little, I relent and take what the market gives me, recording slippage of $175
    on the VIX side of the trade and $100 on the VXX side of the trade. I still manage
    to pocket $800 on the trade, which leaves me long VIX December 22 calls for 2.30
    and short VIX December 44 calls for 3.10.

    is that they run on different expiration cycles. The VIX options expire on December
    17^(th) and the VXX options expire five days later on December 22^(nd). For that
    reason, I anticipate that I will exit the position no later than December 16^(th),
    which is the last day the VXX options are traded.

    time the trade was executed and the end of the day, pushing both calls out of
    the money and securing a $500 profit for the position.'

    higher than when the VIX calls were purchased. VXX lagged during today’s spike
    and is 0.06 below where it was when the VXX calls were sold. The relative weakness
    in the VXX sounds positive for my position, but VXX calls jumped 64% today while
    the VIX calls rose only 39%. The profitability of trade has turned from +$500
    to -$175 in 24 hours.'

    Thanksgiving, the weekend saw the Irish bailout formalized and tensions heating
    up on the Korean Peninsula. Both the VIX and the VIX December (front month) futures
    closed near the 21.50 level, while VXX spiked up to 46.10\. The VIX calls and
    VXX calls are both in the money and my position is now down $475 in one week.
    I am now the beneficiary of $36 of theta each day, but I am disappointed that
    the VIX spike has had more of an impact on the VXX calls than the VIX calls.'

    since September, as concerns lingered about the future of the euro zone and the
    Koreas. My VIX long calls are now 15% in the money and my VXX short calls are
    10.7% in the money, yet the VXX calls continue to be more sensitive to increases
    in volatility. Today the VXX calls jumped 62% while the VIX calls rose 54%. The
    position lost $975 today and is now down $1450 in aggregate. If this were not
    a proof-of-concept trade I would either be exiting the trade or making adjustments
    to limit risk at this stage. As it is, I will let the trade ride, as my preferred
    indicators suggest the VIX is ‘overbought’ and is ripe for some mean reversion.
    My $36 of theta is just a drop in the bucket now.'

    the VIX fell another 7.7% today, as geopolitical and macroeconomic concerns faded
    and were replaced by a rising sense of optimism. Over the course of three days,
    the VIX has fallen 23.5% from 23.54 to 18.0 while VXX has fallen 16.2% from 49.29
    to 41.30\. With both calls well out of the money and the aggregate gain in the
    position up to $825 (above the $800 profit target), here is where I would exit
    the position and lock in profits, but this is a proof-of-concept trade, so I will
    let it ride…'

- en: '*Friday, December 10* – The graphic below details the full lifecycle of this
    trade, which is coming to an end today. Of notable interest, during the last week
    the VIX was relatively steadfast, while VXX lost significant value due to negative
    [roll yield](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/roll%20yield) and a general
    drop across the VIX futures [term structure](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/term%20structure).
    The result is that VXX, which was 2.1% in the money when the calls were shorted
    is now 15.4% out of the money, with the calls fetching only 0.15\. The VIX has
    fared much better, starting out 0.1% in the money and now 13.6% in the money.
    Due to the greater volatility of VIX options and also the extra five days in the
    VIX expiration cycles, the calls still hold a value of 0.55\. For the last three
    days, the position has been registering a profit in the $1150-$1200 range. As
    this is almost certainly going to be whittled back to $800 in the 1 ½ weeks until
    expiration, I am electing to pull the plug on this trade.'

- en: The first key takeaway is that with a little patience, a VIX Minotaur trade
    with a net short VXX position can indeed be profitable. On the flip side, this
    trade can be highly volatile and requires that significant attention be given
    to risk management. In anything other than a proof-of-concept environment, I would
    have exited this trade for a loss long before it had a chance to work its way
    back to profitability.
  prefs: []

- en: I was a little disappointed that the VIX spike did not provide the same lift
    to VIX options that it did to VXX options. This was due to the fact that VXX options
    turned out to be much more sensitive to changes in the underlying than VIX options,
    which is a key learning. Future trades should attempt to establish whether this
    is a persistent theme.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another important consideration is the timing of the two expiration cycles.
    In this instance the position benefitted from the fact that VIX options expiration
    was after VXX options expiration. In August and September VIX options expired
    before VXX options, so I would have expected a more challenging environment for
    this trade during those two expiration cycles.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Future efforts may wish to tweak the degree to which both the VIX and VXX options
    are out of the money and also adjust the units in the ratio to give a higher weighting
    to VIX options.

- en: Finally, score one point for the proof-of-concept trade. When real money is
    on the line, perceptions are more acute, emotional responses and their interaction
    with the trade are more realistic and ultimately any lessons learned are more
    deeply etched in the trading psyche.
