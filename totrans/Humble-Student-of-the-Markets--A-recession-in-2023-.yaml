- en: The Fed has spoken by pivoting to a more hawkish trajectory for monetary policy.
    The FOMC announced that it is doubling the scale of its QE taper, which puts the
    program on track to end in March. The December median dot-plots show that Fed
    officials expect three quarter-point rate hikes in 2022 and three quarter-point
    rate hikes in 2023.

    dot-plot puts monetary policy on track to invert the yield curve some time in
    2023\. Historically, inverted yield curves precede recessions and recessions are
    bull market killers.
