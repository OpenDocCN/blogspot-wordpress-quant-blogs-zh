    might have been "Oracle does this,

    will probably dawn on me when my team has an actual use case that the SPREAD construct
    solves. This is the case that I experienced a few months ago with Coral8 when
    we needed windows that flushed themselves when a certain column changed value

    an important business case. Likewise, if the SPREAD operator is important enough
    that all vendors rush to implement it, then this should be part of the
