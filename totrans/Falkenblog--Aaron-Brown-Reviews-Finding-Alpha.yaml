    pride in that all his other reviews are "5" or "1", which means I made him think.
    I think the positives he mentions are objectively more positive than the negatives--I''d
    rather be sloppy but make an important novel point, than not have such a point
    but write with precision and verve. As my book doesn''t get a thoughtful review
    very often, I want to address his criticisms:'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An example of the sloppiness (and there are many) is on page 21, "The key to
    the portfolio approach is the variance of two random variables is less than the
    sum of their variance." This makes no sense. He might mean "The variance of THE
    SUM of two random variables is less than the sum of their variances,"
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Alas, he is exactly right. I meant 'variance of the sum' but wrote 'sum of the
    variances'. A classic brain fart, like writing 'the wet was water', a phrase one's
    brain turns into 'the water was wet' when you read it 50 times because that's
    what brains do, and reading it over and over makes it even harder to see.

    is not one of my strong points, and should have paid for extra editing, but I
    was grateful to Wiley for publishing my book, and so took what I got. As the list
    of acknowledgements will attests (ie, none), this book did not benefit from extensive
    vetting. There are about 5 such mistakes, and as to whether this is 'many' is
    a matter of perspective. Yet in context generally it was obvious as to what is
    meant. For example, in this case it was right above a graph that shows that portfolio
    variance declines as a function of portfolio size, and talk about how diversification
    lowers risk. But I can sympathize that such mistakes are distracting.

    Amazon sells it for about $60, and the 'used' copies are basically new copies
    released to small stores that are selling it, and these go down to $52\. Nevertheless,
    it is above the usual $20 to $30 one is used to paying for books, but it's a niche,
    and books with math usually have sufficiently small audiences that such is the
    price. I would have liked to sell a $30 book so it could be at Barnes and Noble,
    but it's a rather specific, technical arguement with a limited audience.

    (represented by, say, Fama, French, Cochrane, Campbell, Harvey, Schwert, etc.).
    In a sense, like Taleb, I am criticizing the Establishment, but we have as much
    in common as typical third party candidates. Considering that Taleb's main empirical
    points are about fat tails and peso problems, these are standard problems and
    are addressed through the extant, large literature, that exists independent of
    Taleb.

- en: But in general, I think I amply provide references to earlier research, and
    for almost every empirical point provide specific papers. My novelty, empirically,
    is highlighting that the scope of data suggest a flat risk-return relation in
    general; each individual finding, such as within equities, or currencies, points
    to literature in that domain, literature that is often quite deep.

- en: The book's summary of quantitative finance is backed up by lots of references,
    but I would bet that the author has not read all the references. He doesn't even
    seem to be familiar with Hyman Minksky's work, and he was a graduate assistant
    for Minsky.
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Actually, I have thoroughly read all my references, and I do appreciate Minsky's
    work (I was his TA as an undergrad, not grad), and noted the Minskian notion of
    Keynesian uncertainty was not fruitful because metrics of uncertainty, emprically,
    are not positively related to returns (eg, IPOs, or firms with relatively high
    amounts of analyst forecast dispersion, have lower returns than average).

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And "expected return" only makes sense in a rigorous context (who does the "expecting,"
    and when?). The author scorns rigor, but then uses the concept of expected return
    in a model with divergent expectations among investors, without discussion of
    whose beliefs define the expected return, and fails to distinguish that concept
    clearly from ex post average return and market-clearing return.
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I don't make a distinction between long and short term expectations, and most
    asset pricing models are simple one-period models. In many cases, one can find
    short and long term expectations have different properties unless returns have
    certain distributions, or utility functions have specific functional forms, and
    generally these discussions lead to hair splitting, and generally add little insight.
    Thus, like almost everyone in this space I found this distinction an uninteresting
    complication. More fundamentally, expected returns should equal average returns
    over large enough sample, just as a sample mean converges to the population mean
    over time. That so many assets show sample means in direct contrast to theory
    implies to many of Finance's founding fathers that 'expected returns' are hard
    to measure, but after 50 years I find this rather uncompelling.
