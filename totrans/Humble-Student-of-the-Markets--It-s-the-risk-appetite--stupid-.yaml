    warning about "divergences" celebrate the "confirmation" of the strength of the

    that checks assumptions and biases and can trigger new ideas as well. The historical
    perspective is not always the correct perspective, but it often is a fresh one--and
    there is value in examining one's assumptions critically.

    they can provide warnings of negative environments for stocks, they are not precise
    timing indicators. I showed that the corrections of 2011 and 2012 were not accompanied
    by breadth deterioration in the Advance-Decline Line (see

    weighted long position in the high-beta segments of the market, namely the Russell
    2000 (IWM) and NASDAQ 100 (QQQ), coupled with an equal weighted short position
    in defensive sectors of Consumer Staples (XLP), Utilities (XLU) and Telecom (IYZ).

    the breaks were marked by the dotted purple lines. In three of those instances
    (2008, 2011 and 2012), stock prices either entered a bear market (2008) or corrected
    (2011 and 2012). On one occasion (2010), stocks failed to decline, but that can
    be partly explained by the fact that they had already corrected.

    but marked by the underperformance of European small caps against large caps and
    a loss of appetite in credit markets. Despite the new highs achieved by the major
    US large cap equity averages today, which I believe was a short-term sentiment-driven
    rally (see my previous post
