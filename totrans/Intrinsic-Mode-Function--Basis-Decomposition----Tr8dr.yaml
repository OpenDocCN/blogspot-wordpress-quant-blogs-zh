    for Non-linear and Non-stationary Time Series Analysis: The Hilbert Spectral Analysis](http://videolectures.net/cern_huang_nmnntsa/)“.  
    I found this through Max Dama’s [blog](http://www.maxdama.com/) (thanks).'

- en: Huang proposes a new approach to signal decomposition for non-linear, non-stationary
    signals.   In the presentation he walks through the issues with Fourier, Wavelet,
    and Poincare analysis.   The issues with each of these approaches is that they
    either miss the dynamics in the time domain (fourier, poincare) or miss features
    in the frequency domain (wavelet).   He further goes on to show that, though Hilbert
    space analysis presents both the time and frequency domain, the results are skewed
    by non-stationarity.

- en: '**My Approach** Before I get into Huang’s approach, let me detail the approach
    I have been using.   I had explored wavelets a few years ago and realized their
    limitations.   Wavelets with orthogonal bases lose features in the timeseries
    due to the 2^n partitioning of the signal.   Features that are aligned at the
    center of the 2^n partitions are captured most accurately and those on the fringes
    with diminished accuracy (or not at all).   I designed an empirical basis in response
    to this:'

- en: The above uses a penalized least squares spline as a (near-orthogonal) basis
    function, decomposing the signal at successive frequencies.   The decomposition
    has little cross-correlation so works out to be near orthogonal for the most part.

- en: The basis functions are each optimal least-squares fits and have very little
    in the way of artifacts.   The downside of this basis function is that there is
    non-locality, in that earlier parts of the signal influence the basis function
    in later parts (usually in a non-intrusive way) and is expensive to compute at
    high frequency.

- en: 'Huang’s approach is quite clever and importantly, parsimonious.   The approach
    was motivated by the issues one gets with the Hilbert tranform when dealing with
    a non-stationary timeseries.   What if we could create an empirical basis function
    that creates bases that are centered around the maxima/minima and represent the
    mode.   The algorithm is as follows:'

- en: The resulting basis function has some interesting properties such as the functions
    are centered around the origin with a long term mean approaching zer0 and have
    locality.   HHT is especially good at capturing non-stationary high-frequency
    oscillations with fidelity.

- en: There are, however, some noticable artifacts due to the natural-spline approach
    (notice exaggerated pertubations in the curve near abrupt price movements).  
    This approach fairs less well with abrupt shifts and at timeseries boundaries
    then the approach I have been using.

    analysing the mean.  More on this later.
