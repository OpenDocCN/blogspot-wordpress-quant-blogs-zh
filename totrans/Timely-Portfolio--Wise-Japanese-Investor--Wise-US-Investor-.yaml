    which they reside.  Free markets allow an investor to make a investment independent
    of their country of residence.

- en: If a Japanese investor switches from the Nikkei to short-term Japanese Government
    Bonds at the height of the Japanese equity bubble in December 1989, the investor
    is celebrated as a hero and lauded as one of the greatest investors of all time. 
    However, if the Japanese investor expanded the opportunity set and included United
    States stocks, the Japanese investor would have truly shown amazing wisdom.

- en: The US investor that sold stocks in December 1999 and switched to short-term
    US bonds would be called a superinvestor, but that narrow-minded decision was
    not the best.

- en: Let’s look at a real superhero investor who switched investment allocation 3
    times over the last 30 years.  This superinvestor bought Japanese stocks on 12/31/79,
    US stocks 12/31/89, and emerging market stocks 12/31/99.  This superinvestor would
    have achieved a 1050% return (16.6% annualized) over the last 30 years from 1979-2009.
