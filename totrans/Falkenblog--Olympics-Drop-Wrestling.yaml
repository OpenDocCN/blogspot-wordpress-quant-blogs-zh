- en: OK, here's a conspiracy theory. In 2004 they added women's wrestling along side
    men's to bring down the brand.  I've been to a lot of youth tournaments in the
    past several years, and there's perhaps 1 female wrestler for every 100 to 200
    male wrestlers in grade school. Many lazy news outlets gave equal space to men's
    and women's wrestling previews so as not to discriminate, which is like giving
    Monaco and China the same space in Wikipedia because they are both countries.
    Yesterday the IOC decided to drop wrestling from the 2020 Olympics, while BMX,
    handball, pentathlon and trampoline remain.

    a double leg takedown you have a huge advantage over your average street fighter,
    because transitioning to a choke that ends the tussle is then pretty straightforward.
    Then there are the cases where brawlers are basically hugging each other, in which
    case knowing throws and trips makes this a mismatch: wrestling is skill, you can
    learn moves that give one a large tactical advantage. Having the confidence from
    knowing you can physically defend yourself is extremely valuable even if never
    used.'

    to lose but not being fearing it. Young kids cry a lot when they lose in wrestling
    compared to soccer or baseball. Unlike in team sports, losing is a direct assault
    on their ego, not merely because it''s one-on-one but because the humiliation
    is not nuanced: some guy just pushed you around like a rag doll. Learning how
    to cope with unambiguous defeat is an extremely useful life skill that kids today
    are often sheltered from.'

- en: Yet, as wrestling declines, mixed martial arts like the UFC  rises, so the future
    is not horrible for the gist of my favorite sport.  Further, I never really understood
    the greco-roman wrestling rules as applied in Olympic matches. Human combat will
    always be interesting to humans, and  any competitive combat will have some peculiar
    rules like in wrestling, judo, or boxing, and those sports with the better rules
    will thrive, though perhaps not in the Olympics.
