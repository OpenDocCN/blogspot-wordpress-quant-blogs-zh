    Orinoco (although Charles mentions that it will be part of SS 2008 R2) . When
    I met with the Orinoco team in April, they were still gathering feedback from
    potential customers as to how to market the CEP technology. But, I can imagine
    that for the immediate future, Orinoco will be free to users of SQL Server. I
    can also imagine that some part of Orinoco will be free to Visual Studio users
