    it seems like I am going to try to get ESPA ([Earnings Spike Potential Algorithm](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/earnings%20spike%20potential%20algorithm))
    off the ground.  This immediately raises the question: just how many ugly acronyms
    should I try to prop up in this space?  Maybe I should just do it the way the
    rest of the world does and start with the acronym I want, then reverse engineer
    the full text.'

    Challenge](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/CNBC%20Million%20Dollar%20Portfolio%20Challenge)
    (remember that disaster?) cardboard and duct tape version of the ESPA and tweaked
    it a little for the current earnings season.  The changes are not that major and
    consist largely of beefing up some TA inputs having to do with support and resistance.  The
    resulting ESPA v1.1 seems to do a better job of predicting the magnitude of the
    post-earnings move and a noticeably better job of picking the direction of that
    move (which was previously just a little above 50%.)

    quarter than usual, using the model to be both long and short straddles and strangles,
    as well as playing some instances where I have directional bias with straight
    calls/puts or call/put backspreads.

    on individual stocks, though I may highlight one or two from time to time.  Still,
    looking at some of the [earnings spiker candidates](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=amzn,cybe,anad,anik,bobj,cenx,enwv,wire,epiq,hoku,ilmn,ldis,ntri,pnra,rfmd,sgmo,cake,vrtx,amsg,amx,plt,algn,cra,fcx,pmtc,slab,asia&d=s)
    for AMC today through BMO tomorrow, I was struck by the sheer number of stocks
    with a very high short squeeze potential and a high implied volatility, two ingredients
    that can help turn a couple of sparks into a widespread conflagration.

    has been of the healthy correction variety – the controlled burn that renews instead
    of destroys.  I also think that much of the bearish sentiment we find rolled into
    an 18ish VIX is of the bullish contrarian variety.  As far as I can tell, the
    big fears are on the table and in the headlines.  I suspect that it will require
    something new and unanticipated to give us the type of conflagration where we
    could see something like the [VIX of 25-30](http://buttonwood1792.blogspot.com/2007/07/todays-cnbccom-options-report.html)
