    it represented only a couple hundred billion dollars, and by then the stock market
    seemed to have lost three times that, which seemed an overreaction, a sign of
    excessive volatility due to behavioral biases. This was not a contrary stance,
    rather, the conventional expert opinion. This turned out to be the tip of the
    iceberg, as the fundamental anomaly just continued. From a destruction in value
    of a couple trillion dollars in home values ultimately, the global economy lost
    around 60-80 trillion in value. No one knows how such small losses amplify in
    size and scope to create economy-wide downturns, because we have no good theory
    for it.

    or accelerator mechanism was underappreciated. Savvy investors may have predicted
    the housing debacle, but no one thought this would generalize this to autos, commercial
    real estate, everything, even though these market prices fell as well. This error
    was not because they were stupid, but rather we do not have any good model for
    how this works.

    on the assets of a firm. A firm’s debt is its 'strike price.' That is, owners
    of stock get all the upside, but if the firm loses all its value, the owners lose
    only their equity, the rest of the loss is born by debtowners. The average stock
    is levered 50%, so in general, stocks are options on the value of the firm. When
    I was at Moody's we were active in modeling public firm default rates using the
    Merton approach, where using the value of the stock (aka the 'call option'), the
    value of the debt (the strike price), and the volatility of the stock, you can
    back out an estimate the probability of default.

    of total debt, about 50% on average. That is, if lenders could seize assets immediately,
    once the asset value of the firm hit the value of the debt (99% of par), the lenders
    would take over with minimal loss of principal. In practice debt holders are able
    to sieze the firm only after the firm’s value is well below its strike price.

    is that firm value where debt owners force the firm into bankruptcy. A company
    can live forever, but at some point debtholders stop the clock, declare 'game
    over', and cut their losses. Thus stocks are not just call options, but

    mimicry, the depositors become worried. Bank liabilities are generally shorter
    than their assets, where depositors have an option to call them back at any time.
    A bank run is statistically unlikely in normal times, but if people think the
    bank may be insolvent (ie, assets less than liabilities), they will rush to take
    out their deposits prior to anyone else, creating a self-fulfilling prophesy,
    so that the effective absorbing after a big decline in some parochial sector leads
    investors to wonder if their bank was overexposed to this sector. Quarterly balance
    sheets do not indicate the region, industry, and seniority, and underwriting behind,
    various assets, so when investors see a conspicuous asset decline they are rationally
    wary, as invariably some lenders will have been too concentrated in the affected
    sector. Thus, depositors become skittish, raising the barrier of a firm, because
    if depositors so much as smell a risk, they will create a run, killing the firm
    (eg, Bear Stearns).

    value, its option premium, its equity value, is extinguished. In a standard option,
    volatility is unambiguously a good thing, but with the barrier threatening its
    existence, the derivative switches sign at some point, changing the game entirely.
    Here, the value of the option becomes zero forever at 90, so the vega is zero
    there and below. Another way vega can switch signs is if the barrier is a certain
    level, and the asset value falls below a certain level, vega becomes negative.
    See below for how the vega changes as the asset value (ie, L+A) falls, for a special
    barrier value.

    To repeat: barrier call options, where there is a down-and-out option, switch
    to negative vega as the barrier rises, or for specific barrier levels when the
    asset value falls. This is unlike regular call options where the vega is always
    positive.'

    vega regime, they are not incented to buy any risky asset such as a failing bank.
    This means banks aren't able to buy other banks, effectively raising their absorbing
    barriers because no one is there to salvage their (non-barrier) option value.
    Regulators pile on, becoming more insistent on enforcing regulatory standards
    in order to safeguard banks, again creating a more tangible barrier above the
    strike (debt) price.

    it. They all flee to safe assets, trying to replace risky assets with less risky
    ones, and avoiding the absorbing barrier. In bad times, banks have negative vega,
    they don't want more risky assets, and a failing bank adds a lot of risk (especially
    legal, as Bank of America is finding with their purchase of CountryWide).

    by cutting new lending and instead buy Treasuries (which causes interest rates
    to fall). This negative vega creation could be due to barriers increasing due
    to potential bank runs, or from vega becoming negative as the asset value falls
    (which holds for certain barrier levels). That may seem like a lot of steps, but

    to say. Without them, financing collapses, and the economy stagnates. Only banks,
    with their many professionals evaluating idiosyncratic criteria with the sole
    objective of making money, can create the investment needed for economic growth.
    One can generalize ‘banks’ to any lender, which faces similar incentives and constraints.
    The best thing to do would be to stop threatening bank solvency with unlimited
    liability. All this focus on government stimulus and zero interest rates while
    simultaneously trying to punish banks for the past recession is guaranteed to
    not help because we need banks back in positive vega mode.
