- en: As bond returns are a function of their current yield, and the price appreciation
    from changes in market rates, the rising interest rate environment had low bond
    returns, the falling had rising ones. This leaves a tale of two regimes, and it
    isn’t clear whether the low real returns by maturity prior to 1980, and subsequent
    reversal subsequently, was an ‘expected’ return, or both period were unexpected.

    years as anyone. I worked in a bank economics department from 1987-9, and can
    tell you we had no clue we were in a period of secular interest rate reduction,
    and that those same economists lamented their poor forecasts throughout the 1960’s
    and 70’s. In the 1990’s, 10-year inflation-indexed yields average about 3.5% in
    te UK, and exceeded 4% in the US around2000, and declined until a spike in 2008,
    and currently (2011) are below 1%. These movements are, in the words of Campbell,
    Shiller, and Vaciera (2009, Understanding Inflation-Indexed Bond Markets), a puzzle.

    to a risk premium, Modigliani and Sutch (1966, Innovations in Interest Rate Policy)
    argue that there’s a habitat preference for interest rate investors, so that some
    prefer longer bonds, but most shorter durations. With the development of the stochastic
    discount rate factor, risk premium were supposed to be a function of covariances.

    across maturities or time, of the real return (the nominal return being trivially
    higher in higher inflation environments). The standard covariance factors are
    consumption, and the stock market. Consider the following ''betas'' with the S&P500
    and Real Consumption Growth range from -0.1 to 0.1, with an average of 0.05, depending
    on what periods (53-80 vs. 81-11), time horizon (daily vs. 60 month investment
    horizons), real vs. nominal returns, whether we are regressing against consumption
    vs. S&P500 returns. The point is, the data here are too noisy to confidently say
    that short, or long term Treasuries are ''risky'': there''s always a different
    view that says something different.'

    not show a clear distinction in the bond's S&P500 factor loading, and so it is

- en: The bottom line is that inflationary periods have lower bond returns than disinflationary
    periods, though it is not clear whether these are expected, and thus true risk
    premium. There is no obvious risk premium explanation of the 'default free' spectrum
    of bonds across maturities or time, and any statistical analysis that purports
    to say it all makes complete sense is clearly torturing the data (eg, see Bansal's

- en: This is especially relevant to macroeconomics because in the standard New Keynesian
    models, a representative agent’s Euler equation that links a one-period real interest
    rate to the consumption growth rate is the IS curve central to the policy transmission
    mechanism. A long list of empirical failures come from applying the stochastic
    discount factor implied by that Euler equation. Until someone succeeds in getting
    some kind of consumption-based asset pricing model that works well, the New Keynesian
    IS curve is empirically vacuous.
