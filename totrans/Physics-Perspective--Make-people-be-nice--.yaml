- en: great TED talk by British comedian Tony Hawkes. It's inspiring. He makes a crazy
    proposal for a maximum income scheme; it's crazy but also really different and
    creative. He doesn't want to limit rich people or tear them down, but to help
    them do even better, and to help everyone else in the process. It's an idea of
    how we could set up institutions so that people work hard to be nice and to do
    socially beneficial things.

    solutions, often focused on improving the lot of the people at the bottom with
    measures such as minimum wages. But instead of putting a floor on what people
    get, why not put a ceiling on how much they get to keep?

    drunken bet by hitchhiking around the circumference of Ireland with a medium-sized

    the Moldovan soccer team one-on-one at tennis (he did that, too).'

    of the wealth and fame he had achieved. He decided to donate 50 percent of the
    royalties from his second book to a trust fund for beneficial projects in the
    country. A few years later, after the money had paid for a new care center in
    Chisinau for children with cerebral palsy, Hawks had an epiphany.

    keep up to, say, $500,000 of their income, then would be obliged to give away
    the rest to the charities of their choice -- or, if they like, to a charity of
    their own design and creation. Such a policy would encourage a rapid proliferation
    of philanthropic organizations competing to attract the money -- much like the
    amassing of financial wealth has fueled the money-management industry. More people
    would be able to find jobs doing good things, and society would benefit from their
    efforts and resources.

    dollar of income. This may explain why many of the super-wealthy, such as Warren
    Buffett and Bill Gates, ultimately turn to philanthropy -- making yet more money
    matters little to them in comparison with what they can get back by helping others.

- en: With Hawks's income cap policy, the wealthy would end up competing not just
    to earn the most money, but also to outdo others in making wise and useful gifts
    to the best charities, or to start and manage charities reflecting their values.
    A virtuous circle would be created. The philanthropic activity generated by such
    a policy might significantly reduce the need for many taxpayer-funded government
    programs, reducing the need for income taxes.

    taxes on the rich don''t work: They naturally breed resentment and stifle creativity.
    Governments are often very bad at redistributing the money efficiently. Besides,
    people shouldn''t be punished for working hard and being successful. They should
    be rewarded and encouraged.'

    in a smart way. Hawks has at least the nub of a very good idea. It might not be
    the ultimate answer, but it has the seeds of something very clever in it. We need
    to work harder at imagining what might be possible with policies that encourage
    the better parts of human nature, rather than merely channel people toward gaining
    as much wealth as possible.
