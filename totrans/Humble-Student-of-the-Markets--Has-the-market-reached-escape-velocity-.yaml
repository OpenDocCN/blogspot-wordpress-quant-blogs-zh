- en: Last week was a very data-heavy week, filled with macro events and earnings
    reports from several megacap growth stocks. I was expecting volatility as anything
    could have happened. Instead, the market gods smiled on the bulls as most of the
    events resolved in bullish fashions. Inflation (Employment Cost Index) was tame.
    Employment (JOLTS, ADP, and NFP) were either weak or exhibited weak internals.
    The Fed raised rates by an expected quarter-point. Powell tried, but failed to
    put on a hawkish face. The positive market reaction to META overwhelmed to negative
    reactions to AAPL, AMZN, and GOOGL earnings results.
