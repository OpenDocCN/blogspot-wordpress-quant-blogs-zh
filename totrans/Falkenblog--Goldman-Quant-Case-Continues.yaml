- en: The Goldman quant case that brought High Frequency Trading into the blogosphere
    keeps getting interesting. The ex-Goldman quant sure sounds guilty. Why hire a
    programmer who came to Goldman without financial experience, and worked there
    only a couple years, for $1.1MM? Whence did he get this alpha? He had several
    megabytes of code relating to a trading program explicitly referenced in his confidentiality
    agreement, and was going to implement a high frequency trading algorithm.

    to enforce a litigation noncompete on the firm the ex-Goldman worker was planning
    on working for, filing a motion days after the initial Goldman arrest, probably
    based in part on information revealed in that case.

    let alone key words, extremely difficult. Thus it is not obvious how repetitive
    their arguments are, except when you actually read them. A good argument one year
    by the other side, often makes it into your side the next year if you are on a
    different case, because in law it's all about whatever works (aka 'justice').
    Thus, a lawyer can cut and paste arguments from other cases, and his clients don't
    know he's getting paid $500/hour to have his secretary retype a similar case and
    then do a 'replace' on the party's names. 'Irreparable harm'. 'Millions of dollars'.
    'Extraordinary steps to secure trade secrets'. Judges must feel like they are
    stuck in Groundhog Day, seeing the same cases, only with different people.

- en: Basically, the law allows companies broad leeway to inflict a lot of damage
    via intellectual property litigation. But why would firms do this if they don't
    have a real concern? Signaling (eg, precedent setting) is a rational reason, paranoia
    an irrational one. They then take the case out of a cost-benefit calculus to the
    one being accused, making them a means to an end unrelated to anything they have
    done or could do; you can't simply appeal to their 'self-interest' because sometimes
    that primarily involves crushing you like a bug. If this happens to you and you
    are innocent you're pretty much screwed, so the best defense is to check out the
    legal history of who you might work for, read briefs, and look for a pattern.

  zh: 基本上，法律允许公司通过知识产权诉讼造成大量损害。但如果公司没有真正关切，为什么他们要这样做呢？信号传递（例如，先例确立）是一个合理的理由，妄想症是一个不合理的理由。他们将案件从成本效益考虑转移到被告身上，使其成为了不相关于他们所做或可能做的任何事情的手段；你不能简单地诉诸于他们的'自私利益'，因为有时候这主要包括像踩死你一样。如果这种情况发生在你身上，而你是无辜的，你基本上就完蛋了，所以最好的防御就是查看你可能工作的公司的法律历史，阅读法律意见书，寻找规律。
