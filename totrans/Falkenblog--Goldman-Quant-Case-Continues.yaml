- en: The Goldman quant case that brought High Frequency Trading into the blogosphere
    keeps getting interesting. The ex-Goldman quant sure sounds guilty. Why hire a
    programmer who came to Goldman without financial experience, and worked there
    only a couple years, for $1.1MM? Whence did he get this alpha? He had several
    megabytes of code relating to a trading program explicitly referenced in his confidentiality
    agreement, and was going to implement a high frequency trading algorithm.

    to enforce a litigation noncompete on the firm the ex-Goldman worker was planning
    on working for, filing a motion days after the initial Goldman arrest, probably
    based in part on information revealed in that case.

    let alone key words, extremely difficult. Thus it is not obvious how repetitive
    their arguments are, except when you actually read them. A good argument one year
    by the other side, often makes it into your side the next year if you are on a
    different case, because in law it's all about whatever works (aka 'justice').
    Thus, a lawyer can cut and paste arguments from other cases, and his clients don't
    know he's getting paid $500/hour to have his secretary retype a similar case and
    then do a 'replace' on the party's names. 'Irreparable harm'. 'Millions of dollars'.
    'Extraordinary steps to secure trade secrets'. Judges must feel like they are
    stuck in Groundhog Day, seeing the same cases, only with different people.

    meticulously make sure all his files are unrelated to his old employer, judges
    can not tell if it's The DaVinci Code or a boring statistical evaluation of public
    data. Claims are allowed to change or replaced entirely so the accuser is not
    stuck with original, deficient claims that might surely stop the process.

- en: Basically, the law allows companies broad leeway to inflict a lot of damage
    via intellectual property litigation. But why would firms do this if they don't
    have a real concern? Signaling (eg, precedent setting) is a rational reason, paranoia
    an irrational one. They then take the case out of a cost-benefit calculus to the
    one being accused, making them a means to an end unrelated to anything they have
    done or could do; you can't simply appeal to their 'self-interest' because sometimes
    that primarily involves crushing you like a bug. If this happens to you and you
    are innocent you're pretty much screwed, so the best defense is to check out the
    legal history of who you might work for, read briefs, and look for a pattern.
