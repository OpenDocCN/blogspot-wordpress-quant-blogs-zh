    of 100% long, 100% short, or 100% cash. For my own trading I will often scale
    in and out of positions depending on factors such as the strength of the evidence,
    perceived risk, recent market volatility, the underlying trend, my intermediate-term
    outlook, and more. Still, the Aggregator System can be (and is) traded mechanically.
    After two stellar years (2008 and 2009) it hit a rough patch last summer. But
    more recently the Aggregator System has been on fire. Below is a chart showing
    every entry and exit signal since around Thanksgiving.
