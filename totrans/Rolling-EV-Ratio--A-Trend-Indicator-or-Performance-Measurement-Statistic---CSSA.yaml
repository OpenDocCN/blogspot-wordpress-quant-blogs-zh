    mathematically defining the reward/risk for holding a stock or index at a given
    point in time.

- en: 'The period length should be anywhere from 5-252 days, with shorter term periods
    showing mean-reversion and longer periods reflecting more stable estimates of
    reward/risk. Effectively the Rolling EV Ratio must be greater than .5 to have
    a positive edge, for example a 50% winning percentage with 1 to 1 odds is an even
    money proposition (50% x1=.5). Our goal is to have an EV that is as high as possible,
    but it is also worthwhile looking at changes in the *distribution* of the Rolling
    EV Ratio. In either case, the 252 day Rolling EV Ratio as applied to the Dow Jones
    Industrial Average tested over (gulp!) 20,000 bars  produced the following results
    when traded above .5 and exiting below .5:'

    years the Rolling EV Ratio has been superior to the the 200ma, especially when
    used in a more “normalized” framework. There many  ways to apply this metric–it
    can be used first of all on a weekly, monthly or yearly time frame over a variety
    of period lengths to obtain a more complete picture. Secondly, it can be used
    to evaluate strategies as a means over turning systems on or off, or more importantly-to
    vary the allocation to a system. Finally, it can be used as a relative strength
    or momentum measure that has the benefit of overlooking volatile stocks in lieu
    of  preferring those that have the best combination of  consistency and reward
    to risk.
