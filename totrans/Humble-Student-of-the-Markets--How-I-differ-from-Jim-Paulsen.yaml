    the current environment as market adherence to the long-term trend as overbought
    (my words, not his). Paulsen did the rolling 36-month regressions of stock prices
    and charted the R-squared of the regressions (the higher the R-squared, the tighter
    the fit). He found that current levels of R-squared is in the top decile of fit,

    period of commodity weakness is not a sign of impending recession, but a mid-cycle

    recoveries), commodity prices suffered a severe decline “during an ongoing economic
    recovery. In each of these cases, the economic recovery persisted well beyond
    the bottom in commodity prices. Indeed, in the past, once commodity prices bottomed,
    the pace of economic growth accelerated and the recovery did not end until commodity
    prices had substantially recovered. For example, in the late-1970s recovery, commodity
    prices bottomed in July 1977 and the recovery did not end until January 1980\.
    Similarly, commodity prices bottomed in July 1986 but the economic recovery continued
    until July 1990\. Finally, commodity prices bottomed in early 1999 but the recovery
    did not peak until March 2001\. As shown, a significant decline in commodity prices
    usually points to stronger rather than weaker future economic growth. Moreover,
    once commodity prices do finally bottom, they have typically risen throughout
    the balance of the economic recovery.

    economic growth spurs demand, which lifts commodities into the final peak in the

    prices are inversely correlated to the US Dollar, we need to monitor the differential

    unemployment rate is above 5% (i.e., above full employment). Indeed, since 1948,
    annualized stock returns have been nearly twice as strong and long-term government
    bond returns have been almost four times greater compared to their respective
    returns when the unemployment rate is at or below 5%. Moreover, both stocks and
    bonds have tended to suffer more frequent monthly declines in fully employed economies.
    Finally, on average during the post-war era, once the unemployment rate reaches
    5%, a recession has been less than two years away.

    to consider whether earnings growth will prove sufficient to support current stock
    market valuations. The rapidly aging earnings cycle is perhaps best illustrated
    by an economy nearing full employment with corporate profit margins near record
    highs. Should global growth remain tepid and overall sales results modest, since
    profit margins are unlikely to rise much, earnings trends will also likely prove
    disappointing. Conversely, should global growth and corporate sales results accelerate,
    because the U.S. is nearing full employment, companies may soon face cost-push
    pressures and margin erosion which will likely off set improved sales results.
