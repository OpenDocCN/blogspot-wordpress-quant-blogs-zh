    bank in the 1990, I remember we always had lots of unrecognized gains in our book
    of assets acquired from the S&L crisis. It seemed like a bottomless cookie jar
    that bailed us out whenever we needed it. As there were lots of banks, and bank
    assets, sold well below their value, it seeded the best decade of bank stock returns
    ever. But after the latest crisis, bank stocks have stagnated well below their
    prior peaks.

    assets, and not only have those prices fallen, but the rules have changed, so
    that the time to foreclosure has more than doubled. Thus, banks still have lots
    of unrecognized losses, and like Japan in the 1990s, hope to slowly write them
    off. I'm guessing. One thing I learned about banking is that unless you have some
    first hand knowledge that CFOs have, you don't really know.
