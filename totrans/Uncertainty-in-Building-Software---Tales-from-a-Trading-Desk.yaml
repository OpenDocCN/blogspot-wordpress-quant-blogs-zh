- en: In Scrum, the Development Team is now asked to forecast the specific work that
    can be done in a Sprint, rather than “commit” to it. This allows teams to focus
    on the things that matter in professional software development like quality, value,
    and continuous improvement, ***rather*** than satisfying an arbitrary obligation.

    the inherent ***uncertainty*** in building software of any real value and complexity.
    Their responsibility is to create an environment where Development Teams can succeed,
    and trust in those teams’ professionalism to do all they can to deliver things
    of value.
