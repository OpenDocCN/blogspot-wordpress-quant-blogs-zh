    constricted stay-at-home trader/investor, I sometimes find myself missing those
    six hour coast-to-coast flights where I could point my brainwaves in a particular
    direction and [free associate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_association_%28psychology%29)
    without fear of interruption.  Yesterday I had one of those rare opportunities
    for brainstorming at 38,000 feet and from that session comes a number of ideas
    that I will likely be talking about in this space in the next two or three months.

    work already done in some of my target areas of interest, I would love to hear
    about these as well.
