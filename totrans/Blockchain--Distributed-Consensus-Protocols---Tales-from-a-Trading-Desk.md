## Blockchain: Distributed Consensus Protocols

Dom Steil [article](http://domsteil.com/2014/12/29/distributed-consensus-protocols/) on Distributed Consensus Protocols provides an overview of a few of the implements available.

> Asset creation built from the Bitcoin blockchain = [Sidechains](http://blockstream.com/)
> 
> Asset creation built off the Bitcoin blockchain = [Counterparty](http://counterparty.io/)
> 
> Asset ledger creation built on distributed nodes = Hyperledger
> 
> Application and smart contract creation = Ethereum (AWS [mining](https://github.com/angelomilan/ethereum-guides/blob/master/GPU-cloud_mining.md) and “Create your [own](https://ethereum.org/token) Crypto-Currency”)
> 
> Application framework built on top of Ethereum = Eris. Ethereum has gained further press [recently](http://www.itworldcanada.com/article/ethereum-offers-platform-for-decentralized-enterprise-applications/376337) around [Adept](https://www.theprotocol.tv/adept-demo-ibm-samsung/) and [Provenance](https://www.provenance.org/).

One would assume that the investment banking arena is most interested in Hyperledger, [MultiChain](http://www.multichain.com/) and Ethereum from an asset trading and post trade perspective – due to [Confidential](http://www.multichain.com/blog/2015/07/bitcoin-vs-blockchain-debate/) [Transactions](http://gendal.me/2015/06/10/quick-notes-on-sidechains-elements/).  Curious also as to what banks are looking at [t0](http://t0.com/) (the trade is the [settlement](http://www.coindesk.com/overstock-unveils-blockchain-trading-platform-to/))
