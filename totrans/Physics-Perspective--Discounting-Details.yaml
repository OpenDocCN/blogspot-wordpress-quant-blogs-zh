    To calculate the total discount factor over a string of N years, you should multiply
    the individual factors associated with each year as follows,

    the correct discount factor to use over the coming N years means averaging over
    all possible future paths, i.e. all possible sequences of values r

    turns out that in many cases r

    as T gets larger. This is what Farmer and Geanakoplos have shown using computer
    simulations to do the calculation. They used a so-called geometric random walk
    for the fluctuating rate r, this being the most common mathematical process used
    in finance to model interest rate fluctuations (i.e. this isn't a crazy or weird
    model, but a highly plausible one).

    In other words, it makes discounting much weaker than the incorrect exponential
    form would suggest it should be.

    a table indicating just how rapidly, after 200 years or so, the exponential and
    power law forms give wildly different results, with the exponential discounting
    the value of the future millions or billions of times too strong.

    so profoundly, but this indeed seems to be what we are currently doing. The incorrect
    exponential form is in wide and standard use by economists doing cost-benefit
    analyses of everything.
