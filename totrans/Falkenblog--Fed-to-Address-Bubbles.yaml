- en: Crude rose 697 percent since trading at $17.45 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
    Exchange in November 2001\. The last time a similar pattern was seen in equities
    was eight years ago, when Internet-related stocks sent the Nasdaq Composite Index
    up 640 percent to its highest level ever, according to data compiled by Bloomberg
    and Bespoke Investment Group LLC.

    Investment Group LLC编制的数据。
- en: So, am I comforted that the Fed is going to start looking for bubbles? Perhaps.
    Assume oil is a bubble. What do you do? I guess one place to start, would be to
    make sure the anticipated volatility to any oil related positions, at Fed regulated
    entities, has anticipated the scenario where oil falls back to $17 a barrel in
    two years. I mean, if the UBS writedown told us anything, it's that at the very
    least one needs to model an asset moving in the exact opposite path it has gone.
    And remember that UBS used the past 5 years of history to generate their res mortgage
    risk, which in this context, would basically assume a symmetric decline in oil
    is impossible.

  zh: '那么，我对美联储将开始寻找经济泡沫感到安心吗？也许吧。假设原油泡沫破裂了。那你会怎么做？我猜，一个开始的地方是确保对任何与石油有关的头寸预期的波动性在美联储监管实体中，预期的情况下，石油两年内回落到每桶17美元。我的意思是，如果瑞银集团的减值准备告诉我们任何事情，那就是至少需要对资产运动进行建模，以便与其相反的路径相同。记住，瑞银集团用过去5年的历史数据产生了他们的住房抵押风险，而在这种情况下，基本上假设原油的对称下降是不可能的。  '
- en: The scary thing would be if they started throwing all sorts of limits on markets,
    or other stupid solutions. The Fed has a lot of smart people. Now, if a congressman
    said they were contemplating legislation aimed at ameliorating bubbles, I would
    be really scared. I think it was Alan Blinder who noted that the Fed was efficient
    because it was kind of immune from the demagoguing in the legislative branch.

  zh: 让人害怕的是，如果他们开始对市场施加各种限制，或者提出其他愚蠢的解决方案。美联储有很多聪明人。如果一位国会议员表示他们正在考虑旨在减轻泡沫的立法，我会非常害怕。我认为是艾伦·布林德指出美联储的高效在于它在立法分支中有一定的免疫性。
