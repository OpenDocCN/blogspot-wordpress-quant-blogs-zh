    of the "100 Women of Hedge Funds" (must..not..make...joke) and Stern mentioned
    that the Fed was going to start looking into bubbles. Now,

    Exchange in November 2001\. The last time a similar pattern was seen in equities
    was eight years ago, when Internet-related stocks sent the Nasdaq Composite Index
    up 640 percent to its highest level ever, according to data compiled by Bloomberg
    and Bespoke Investment Group LLC.

    Assume oil is a bubble. What do you do? I guess one place to start, would be to
    make sure the anticipated volatility to any oil related positions, at Fed regulated
    entities, has anticipated the scenario where oil falls back to $17 a barrel in
    two years. I mean, if the UBS writedown told us anything, it's that at the very
    least one needs to model an asset moving in the exact opposite path it has gone.
    And remember that UBS used the past 5 years of history to generate their res mortgage
    risk, which in this context, would basically assume a symmetric decline in oil
    is impossible.

    or other stupid solutions. The Fed has a lot of smart people. Now, if a congressman
    said they were contemplating legislation aimed at ameliorating bubbles, I would
    be really scared. I think it was Alan Blinder who noted that the Fed was efficient
    because it was kind of immune from the demagoguing in the legislative branch.
