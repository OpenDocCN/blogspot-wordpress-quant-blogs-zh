    few years. Mr. Market has been showing his concern as well. My framework for analysis
    is the relative return of the country market ETFs of China and its major trading
    partners against the MSCI All-Country World Index ETF (ACWI). That way, all returns
    are denominated in USD and therefore any exchange rate effects are neutralized.

    ETF. It recently violated a major relative support area, with little signs of
    relative support below. I interpret this as Mr. Market telling us that the era
    of Chinese infrastructure-led growth, which stimulated outsized commodity demand,
    is over.

    have been able to do so had political power in China been as dispersed in the
    1980s as it is today. In that sense what seems like an attempt by President Xi
    to consolidate power more tightly within a small group is perhaps not a step “backwards”
    in political liberalization but more of a temporary retreat in order to ensure
    a successful adjustment, which itself might be a precondition to further political
    liberalization some time in the future.'
