    Most of the time the idea is based in technical analysis. It looks to answer the
    question, “How has the market performed in the past after…”

  zh: 我展示了研究的布局。研究仅仅是某个想法的测试结果。大多数时候这个想法是基于技术分析的。它试图回答这样的问题，“在过去…市场表现如何？”
- en: Some studies are fairly general. For instance, I might look at how the market
    performs after it has traded down 3 days in a row. Others are more specific with
    added filters. Perhaps I notice that not only is the SPX down 3 days in a row,
    but it also is trading at a 10-day low, and is above the 200ma and volume has
    increased each of the last 3 days.

  zh: 有些研究相当泛泛。例如，我可能会研究市场在连续三天下跌后的表现。其他的研究则更加具体，加入了额外的筛选条件。也许我注意到，不仅是标普500连续三天下跌，同时它也处于10日低点，并且高于200日均线，而且成交量在过去三天中每天都在增加。
- en: Both studies could tell me something about the market in relation to its current
    condition (assuming I’m describing current conditions, which is typically my approach).
    If I am able to describe conditions that more closely match the current market
    then I have a better shot at seeing behavior over the next several days match
    up with the study results. Of course there is a trade-off between general and
    specific, and that is the number of instances.

  zh: 这两个研究都能告诉我关于市场的一些信息，这些信息与市场的当前状况有关（假设我在描述当前状况，这通常是我的做法）。如果我能描述出与当前市场更为接近的条件，那么我就有更大的机会看到未来几天市场行为与研究结果相符。当然，泛泛与具体之间存在一个权衡，那就是实例的数量。
- en: A general test may have hundreds or thousands of instances which it can refer
    to in order to generate expectations. A very specific test may have an extremely
    low number of instances. If the number of instances is too low then the results
    may have little or no meaning. For instance if my parameters are run and I find
    that the market had only set up in a similar manner 1 other time over my test
    period, is it reasonable to assume that the market will act the same way this
    time? Most people would correctly assume “no”. What if there were 2 instances
    and they both had similar reactions in the past. Could I assume this suggests
    a directional edge? 3 instances? 4? 10? 30? 50? More? How many instances is “enough”
    to have some level of confidence that your results are actually suggesting an
    edge and they are not the result of luck?

  zh: 一个泛泛的测试可能有成百上千个实例，它可以引用这些实例来生成预期。一个非常具体的测试可能有非常少的实例。如果实例数量太少，那么结果可能几乎没有意义。例如，如果我的参数运行后发现，在整个测试期间，市场只以类似的方式出现过一次，假设这次市场会以同样的方式行动，这是否合理？大多数人会正确地认为“不”。如果过去有两次实例，并且它们在过去都有类似的表现，我能否假设这暗示了方向性边缘？三个实例？四个？十个？三十个？五十个？更多？多少个实例才“足够”让你有信心，你的结果实际上暗示了一个边缘，而不是运气的结果？
- en: Before answering let me address 1 common misconception people have about statistical
    testing. That misconception is that you need 30 instances in order to demonstrate
    statistical significance. This idea originates in the fact that a sample size
    of 30 is needed in order to calculate a Z-score or run a chi-square test. The
    reason that 30 instances are necessary is that Z-scores assume a normal probability
    distribution. Without 30 instances it is not possible to resolve the shape of
    the normal probability distribution clearly enough to make certain statistical
    measures valid. One thing traders should be aware of is that the stock market
    does not have a normal distribution anyway. It has “fat tails”. In other words,
    there are more outliers present in stock market movements than one would expect
    under a normally distributed curve. So relying on standard statistical measures
    and assuming a normal distribution could expose a trader to more risk than his
    results would imply.

  zh: 在回答之前，让我先澄清一个关于统计测试的常见误解。这个误解是，你需要30个实例才能证明统计显著性。这个想法源于需要30个样本量来计算Z分数或运行卡方测试的事实。之所以需要30个实例，是因为Z分数假设一个正态概率分布。没有30个实例，就不可能清晰地解决正态概率分布的形状，从而使某些统计度量有效。交易员应该注意的一件事是，股市本身并不具有正态分布。它有“厚尾”。换句话说，在股市波动中出现的异常值比在正态分布曲线下预期的要多。因此，依赖标准统计度量并假设正态分布可能会使交易员面临比他的结果所暗示的更大的风险。
- en: Still, these tests are helpful in determining whether your results were likely
    due to a real edge or whether there is a high risk that luck played a big part.
    But what if you don’t have 30 instances? In that case you could use a t-table
    statistic.

  zh: 即便如此，这些测试在判断你的结果是否可能源于某种真实优势，或者运气是否起了很大作用方面仍然是有帮助的。但是，如果你没有30个实例怎么办？在这种情况下，你可以使用t表统计。

- en: Note that this post also contains a t-table. One interesting thing we can see
    when looking at a t-table is the minimum number of instances you would need to
    have different confidence levels that your edge is actually an edge and not due
    to luck. For instance, if all instances were followed by a market rise, you would
    want at least 6 instances in order to be 95% confident that there was an actual
    edge. A 99.9% confidence would be reached if you had 11 instances that all resulted
    in a rise over the next X days.

  zh: 请注意，这篇文章还包含了一个t表。当我们查看t表时，一个有趣的事情是我们可以看到你需要多少个实例才能有不同置信水平地认为你的优势实际上是一个优势，而不是运气使然。例如，如果所有实例都伴随着市场上涨，那么你至少需要6个实例才能有95%的置信度认为实际上存在优势。如果你有11个实例，且所有实例都在接下来的X天内导致上涨，将达到99.9%的置信度。

    trading higher 5 days later. This means statistically there is about a 99.9% chance
    that the positive results were due to more than luck. That there has in fact been
    a real edge in that pattern in the past. Does this mean there is a 100% chance
    it will be higher 5 days after the setup? No! Not even close. A high degree of
    confidence means there is likely some kind of an edge. It doesn’t mean the past

  zh: 在过去，SPY只形成了那种模式12次，但每次在5天后交易价格都更高。这意味着从统计上来说，有大约99.9%的几率正面的结果是由于运气之外的原因。实际上在过去那种模式中确实存在一个真实优势。这意味着在设置后5天它有100%的几率会更高吗？不！相差甚远。高度的置信度意味着可能存在某种优势。这并不意味着过去的胜率或净预期
    likely to persist indefinitely.
- en: So how many instances do I require before I’m willing to accept a study as part
    of my analysis and place it on my active list? It varies depending on things like
    the strength of previous reactions and other stats I’ll get into in my next post,
    but I’ll generally use a t-table to help me decide. Will I incorporate a study
    with only 10 or 11 instances? Yes, but it will have to have strong win/loss stats
    and a high win %. Personally, I tend to favor studies that have somewhere between
    20-70 instances. Too low and they are less reliable. Too high and the setup is
    often too broad to have much meaning.

  zh: 那么，在我将一个研究作为分析的一部分并将其列入我的活动列表之前，我需要多少个实例呢？这取决于先前反应的强度和其他我将在下一篇文章中提到的统计数据，但我通常会使用t表来帮助我做出决定。我只会接受只有10个或11个实例的研究吗？是的，但它必须有强劲的胜负统计数据和高胜率。我个人更倾向于那些有20-70个实例的研究。实例太少，它们可靠性较低。实例太多，设置通常过于宽泛，缺乏实际意义。
