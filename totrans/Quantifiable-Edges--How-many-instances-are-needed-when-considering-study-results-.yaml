    advantage.  Today I'll discuss a common question I get about the studies.  How
    many instances are needed for valid and usable results?  It will lead into "What
    makes a study compelling?" in the next post.

    Most of the time the idea is based in technical analysis. It looks to answer the
    question, “How has the market performed in the past after…”

- en: Some studies are fairly general. For instance, I might look at how the market
    performs after it has traded down 3 days in a row. Others are more specific with
    added filters. Perhaps I notice that not only is the SPX down 3 days in a row,
    but it also is trading at a 10-day low, and is above the 200ma and volume has
    increased each of the last 3 days.

    condition (assuming I’m describing current conditions, which is typically my approach).
    If I am able to describe conditions that more closely match the current market
    then I have a better shot at seeing behavior over the next several days match
    up with the study results. Of course there is a trade-off between general and
    specific, and that is the number of instances.

- en: A general test may have hundreds or thousands of instances which it can refer
    to in order to generate expectations. A very specific test may have an extremely
    low number of instances. If the number of instances is too low then the results
    may have little or no meaning. For instance if my parameters are run and I find
    that the market had only set up in a similar manner 1 other time over my test
    period, is it reasonable to assume that the market will act the same way this
    time? Most people would correctly assume “no”. What if there were 2 instances
    and they both had similar reactions in the past. Could I assume this suggests
    a directional edge? 3 instances? 4? 10? 30? 50? More? How many instances is “enough”
    to have some level of confidence that your results are actually suggesting an
    edge and they are not the result of luck?

- en: Before answering let me address 1 common misconception people have about statistical
    testing. That misconception is that you need 30 instances in order to demonstrate
    statistical significance. This idea originates in the fact that a sample size
    of 30 is needed in order to calculate a Z-score or run a chi-square test. The
    reason that 30 instances are necessary is that Z-scores assume a normal probability
    distribution. Without 30 instances it is not possible to resolve the shape of
    the normal probability distribution clearly enough to make certain statistical
    measures valid. One thing traders should be aware of is that the stock market
    does not have a normal distribution anyway. It has “fat tails”. In other words,
    there are more outliers present in stock market movements than one would expect
    under a normally distributed curve. So relying on standard statistical measures
    and assuming a normal distribution could expose a trader to more risk than his
    results would imply.

    due to a real edge or whether there is a high risk that luck played a big part.
    But what if you don’t have 30 instances? In that case you could use a t-table
    statistic.

- en: Note that this post also contains a t-table. One interesting thing we can see
    when looking at a t-table is the minimum number of instances you would need to
    have different confidence levels that your edge is actually an edge and not due
    to luck. For instance, if all instances were followed by a market rise, you would
    want at least 6 instances in order to be 95% confident that there was an actual
    edge. A 99.9% confidence would be reached if you had 11 instances that all resulted
    in a rise over the next X days.

- en: ', SPY only set up in that pattern 12 times in the past, but every time it was
    trading higher 5 days later. This means statistically there is about a 99.9% chance
    that the positive results were due to more than luck. That there has in fact been
    a real edge in that pattern in the past. Does this mean there is a 100% chance
    it will be higher 5 days after the setup? No! Not even close. A high degree of
    confidence means there is likely some kind of an edge. It doesn’t mean the past
    winning % or net expectations are likely to persist indefinitely.'

    of my analysis and place it on my active list? It varies depending on things like
    the strength of previous reactions and other stats I’ll get into in my next post,
    but I’ll generally use a t-table to help me decide. Will I incorporate a study
    with only 10 or 11 instances? Yes, but it will have to have strong win/loss stats
    and a high win %. Personally, I tend to favor studies that have somewhere between
    20-70 instances. Too low and they are less reliable. Too high and the setup is
    often too broad to have much meaning.
