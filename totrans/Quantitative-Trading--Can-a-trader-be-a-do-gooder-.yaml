    selfish, self-enriching, narcissistic person is to trade well enough so that you
    can manage other people's money and thus saving these investors from crooks and
    charlatans (provided you are convinced you are not a crook and charlatan yourself).

    convinced by them.

    to liquidate their investments. But then, this applies only to mean-reversal strategies.
    Momentum strategies take away liquidity from the market, and in some cases exacerbating
    price bubbles. Certainly not something your grandma would approve.

    through quick price movements. But can't we just watch Bloomberg or CNBC? Do we
    really need some devious insiders to convey that information to the rest of us
    through price movements?

    short-term self-sustenance): as training and preparation to become a fund manager.
    Once you graduated from independent trading, you then enter into the grand contest
    among all fund managers to see who can best serve and protect'

    seem to be what policemen should be doing, not traders. But as in quantitative
    trading, I think it helps one becomes more successful in one's activities by having
    a simple guiding principle or model. And it doesn't hurt that in this case, the
    principle would also be conscience-nourishing!
