# VIX and More: Portfolio A1 Increases Lead Over SPX as Markets Drop

After the disastrous mid-August performance, it was heartening to see Portfolio A1 outperform the benchmark S&P 500 index during last week’s market turbulence.  While the margin of outperformance was small, this now means that the portfolio is up 9.6% since the February 16, 2007 inception – a period in which the SPX is down 0.1%.

Some of the portfolio’s individual holdings did not fare particularly well during the week, with the result that the stock ranking system has elected to drop [DryShips (DRYS)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=drys) and [StatoilHydro (STO)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=sto).  These stocks are being replaced by China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., more commonly known as [Sinopec (SNP)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=snp), as well as [Perini (PCR)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=pcr), the large Boston-based construction company.  In spite of the very strong year it has had, I am not sure I would be chasing Perini at this point, but, this being a mechanical portfolio, all I can do is raise an eyebrow and be prepared to eat some crow.

There are no other changes to the portfolio this week.

A snapshot of the portfolio is as follows:
