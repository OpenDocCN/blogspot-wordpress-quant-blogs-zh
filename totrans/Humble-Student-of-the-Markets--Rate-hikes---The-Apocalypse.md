# Humble Student of the Markets: Rate hikes ≠ The Apocalypse

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2017/03/rate-hikes-apocalypse.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2017/03/rate-hikes-apocalypse.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models**

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post,

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The

**Trend Model**

is an asset allocation model which applies trend following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or contraction (bearish)?"

My inner trader uses the

**trading component**

of the Trend Model to look for changes in the direction of the main Trend Model signal. A bullish Trend Model signal that gets less bullish is a trading "sell" signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading "buy" signal. The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. Past trading of the trading model has shown turnover rates of about 200% per month.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Buy equities*
*   Trend Model signal: Risk-on*
*   Trading model: Bearish*

** The performance chart and model readings have been delayed by a week out of respect to our paying subscribers.* **Update schedule**

: I generally update model readings on my

on weekends and tweet mid-week observations at @humblestudent. Subscribers will also receive email notices of any changes in my trading portfolio.

**Pundits vs. the bond market**

As expected, the FOMC delivered a rate hike last week, From the bond market`s perspective, you would have thought that the Fed cut rates. The stock market rallied, and bond yields fell.

From the viewpoint of some of the pundits, I thought that the Apocalypse was at hand.

[David Rosenberg](http://www.mauldineconomics.com/outsidethebox/is-mr.-market-playing-the-role-of-pavlovs-dog)

warned that "There have been 13 Fed rate hike cycles in the post-WWII era, and 10 landed the economy in recession".

Not to be outdone,

[Bill Gross](http://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gross-our-highly-levered-financial-system-is-like-a-truckload-of-nitro-glycerin-on-a-bumpy-road-2017-3)

said that "Our highly levered financial system is like a truckload of nitro-glycerin on a bumpy road".

What's going on? Who is right, the bond market, or the pundits?
