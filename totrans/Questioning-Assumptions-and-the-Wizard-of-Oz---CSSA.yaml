    never been one to  take old theories or new concepts at face value. The root of
    truth comes from asking good questions that get to the root of the assumptions
    made by a given theory or research finding–no matter how elegant. The sad fact
    is that in the world of economics and finance, tackling a journal article involves
    making sense of  a sea of incomprehensible numerical symbols and mathematical
    proofs. When you combine that with dense tables and strange acronyms for arcane
    statistical procedures, it is no wonder that most give up after the first few
    pages. Most authors could qualify to be math professors at any university, and
    could readily solve the area of the pyramid without a calculator. The veil of
    numerical and statistical rigor is just as intimidating as the Wizard of Oz. The
    comparison couldn’t be more appropriate, because often as you dig deeper into
    the underlying logic of many of these articles the voice beckons: “Pay no attention
    to the man behind the curtain!”'

  zh: 对于那些关注博客的人来说，可能不会惊讶于我从未盲目接受过旧理论或新概念。真理的根源来自于提出好的问题，这些问题触及给定理论或研究发现所做出的假设——无论这些假设多么优雅。经济学和金融界的悲惨事实是，研究一篇期刊文章需要理解一大堆难以理解的数字符号和数学证明。当你再加上密集的表格和为神秘统计程序取的奇怪缩写时，难怪大多数人会在前几页就放弃。大多数作者都有资格在任何大学担任数学教授，并且能不使用计算器就轻松解决金字塔的面积问题。数字和统计严谨性的面纱与《绿野仙踪》中的巫师一样令人畏惧。这种比较再合适不过了，因为当你更深入地挖掘这些文章背后的逻辑时，声音就会召唤：“不要关注幕后的人！”
- en: If you can truly keep yourself awake and focus on each line of math, and each
    sentence of methodology—-the premises and assumptions are laid bare for the skilled
    prosecutor to attack. If you fail to pay attention, the message  of the paper
    seems unquestionable and you are left feeling helpless but to accept its conclusions.
    But this effect is not specific to finance or economic papers—no, this effect
    is found in almost all the news articles and financial media. It is also found
    within the blogosphere (myself included) where substantiation is secondary to
    content.  Many of the gurus especially on TV are guilty of speaking way over people’s
    heads, and quoting facts that no one could possibly verify which helps them in
    making conclusions that no one can question. Put on a suit and tie, some grey
    hairs and a respectable appearance and it becomes even harder to question their
    version of the truth.

  zh: 如果你真的能保持清醒并关注每一行数学，每一个方法论的句子——前提和假设就会展现在熟练的检察官面前任其攻击。如果你没有注意到，论文的信息似乎不容置疑，你只能无助地接受其结论。但这种效果并不仅限于金融或经济学论文——不，这种效果几乎出现在所有的新闻文章和金融媒体中。在博客圈（包括我自己）也是如此，那里的内容是次要的，重要的是论证。许多电视上的大师们有罪于说的内容远远超出人们的理解能力，引用的事实无法验证，这有助于他们做出无法质疑的结论。穿上西装、打领带，有些白发和令人尊敬的外表，质疑他们的真理版本就变得更加困难。
- en: 'Whenever you listen to an argument, opinion, or  theory, ask yourself this:
    1) what are the premises of the argument that are being made? 2) what are the
    hidden premises that are implied but not explicitly mentioned 3) what are the
    facts/evidence being used to substantiate a given conclusion etc 4) do the facts
    and evidence logically support the conclusion 5) is/are the facts and evidence
    being measured possibly spurious or inaccurate? could they possibly be interpreted
    in a different way—if so what might they also imply? You might think that this
    process is a waste of time—or be the type of person who is focused on backtests,
    the latest Goldman report,  and the performance metric du jour. If so you are
    totally missing the point—the numbers cannot and most certainly will not tell
    you about the things that you haven’t considered in designing a system for example.
    The facts that you have in front of you cannot tell you what you haven’t thought
    about when you make a qualitative decision to buy a stock or commodity.  ***Most
    of us are victims of the need to seek confirmation and validation due to our inherent
    insecurity about making decisions under conditions of uncertainty.*** As a result
    whatever you have to support your decisions– whether advice from a guru or your
    own research or backtesting— will always seem more thorough and accurate than
    it actually is. Its up to you to find out which is which.'

  zh: 无论何时当你听到一个论点、观点或理论，问自己以下问题：1) 论点是基于哪些前提？2) 有哪些隐含但未明确提及的前提？3) 用哪些事实/证据来支持给定的结论等？4)
    事实和证据逻辑上支持结论吗？5) 事实和证据可能是虚假或不准确的吗？它们可能以不同的方式解释吗——如果是这样，它们还可能暗示什么？你可能会认为这个过程是浪费时间——或者你是那种专注于回测、最新的高盛报告和当天的绩效指标的人。如果是这样，你完全误解了重点——数字不可能告诉你你在设计系统时没有考虑的事情。你面前的事实无法告诉你，当你做出买入股票或商品的定性决策时，你没有考虑过什么。***我们中的大多数人因为面对不确定性时做决策的固有不安全感，而寻求确认和验证的受害者。***
    因此，无论你有多少支持你决策的东西——无论是大师的建议、你自己的研究还是回测——总是看起来比实际上更全面、更准确。找出哪个是哪个取决于你自己。
