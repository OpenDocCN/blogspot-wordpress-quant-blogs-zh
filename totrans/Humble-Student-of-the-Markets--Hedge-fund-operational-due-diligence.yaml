- en: I would ask Cox Owen to guest blog on the issue of operational diligence. Cox
    has worked with and consulted for hedge funds, prime brokers, fund administrators
    and others for almost eight years in numerous capacities. While in the hedge fund
    business he has worked as an operations manager, trader, project manager, consultant
    and more. Cox's experience of launching his own fund and consulting for other
    start up funds has allowed him to gain an in-depth understanding of the operational
    due diligence process.

- en: Operational Due Diligence within the hedge fund world typically is done to verify
    that the fund is doing what they say they are doing and to ensure that the fund
    is following industry regulations and best practices.

    their ideas of fraud into alpha generation we will continue to see crisis after
    crisis. Unfortunately our regulators come up with solutions like SOX and FAS 157
    after the damage is done. The regulators in our industry need to be proactive
    and not reactive to these types of double dealings.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With that being said, let me first say how sorry I am to all of the people who
    have been affected by the actions of the executives in the financial firms that
    have put us in this hellish situation. It seems that in executive speak - marketing
    is synonymous with lying and retention payment is synonymous with bonus. Since
    or current regulatory environment allows the Madoffs of the world to make fools
    of the fund of funds, hedge funds and other asset managers it seems that this
    is a good time to discuss operational due diligence.

    mess. I am saying they could have done a lot to help prevent to current situation
    if we had rigorous regulation in the certain markets, specifically the swaps market.
    Unfortunately since there is no accountability for the Wall Street executives
    we will continue to see these firms grossly mismanaged again and again with bailout
    after bailout until we hold the executives and board members are held accountable
    or until it drags our country into a depression. Given all of the financial events
    that have occurred since 9/15/2008 (the day Lehman filed bankruptcy) through today,
    we are going to have to rely on ourselves for longevity. We will achieve this
    only through extensive operational due diligence within our industry.

    for the financial institutions that invested with Mr. Madoff. These financial
    institutions are supposed to verify numerous operational components of any type
    of investment vehicle they invest in. No one is sure what due diligence was done
    by these firms, we are only sure that it was offensively inadequate. They only
    logical explanation that I can see is that these firms were impressed with his
    background as Chairman of the NASDAQ and other moving accolades. There is certainly
    a place in my heart for all of the non-sophisticated investors (even though they
    might be classified as sophisticated because of income or net worth) who did not
    have the staff or knowledge to look into this Ponzi scheme.

- en: I was recently asked to draft an operational due diligence manual to show the
    complete depth of OPDD. As I pondered the task I quickly came to the conclusion
    that each manual would be different. Conducting OPDD on a trend following CTA
    would be entirely different from a distressed debt shop, convertible arbitrage,
    market neutral and every other type of strategy. Of course you would have plenty
    of similarity in the basic questions, number of employees, who are the principals,
    what sectors do you trade, etc. I clearly understand the reason for secrecy in
    the hedge fund world. OPDD is not about getting the recipe to the secret sauce
    used in McDonalds hamburgers, rather it is to verify that there is a sauce, a
    hamburger, customers, and all of the other components that make a successful transaction
    in today’s markets. After almost 40 pages into my 1st manual for one strategy
    it became clear that this project could grow to about 150 pages. So not to bore
    you with all of the details I will try to provide you with a very high level overview
    of OPDD. So here we go, Before examining the core aspects of any operational components
    of a hedge fund we should look at the fundamental characteristics that will give
    us a better feel for the overall evaluation of the fund in question. Due Diligence
    starts before the front door, understand the prospect and their strategy before
    having in-depth conversations. Request offering documents and marketing literature.

    tabloids find a launch story to be news worthy there may be some credibility to
    given to the fund managers. The sword cuts both ways, often you can find articles
    that take a negative spin. Read as many articles as you can and ask questions
