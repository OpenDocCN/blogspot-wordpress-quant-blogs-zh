- en: From a volatility perspective, 2008 continues to unfold in a curious manner.  The
    markets are decidedly bearish – and even when they briefly recover or drift sideways,
    the doom and gloom headlines continue to cast a long shadow over investors’ expectations
    about the markets going forward.  The VIX, on the other hand, hardly seems to
    care, registering an increase of 1.08 over the last seven weeks.  The same is
    true for the VWSI, which has treaded water in the +3 to -3 range during this period.

    VWSI moved more significantly, from 0 to +3, but the +3 reading from the end of
    the week is still consistent with a neutral outlook.

    markets, Barry Ritholtz at [The Big Picture](http://bigpicture.typepad.com/) sums

    in the [ISEE](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/ISEE), which ended the
    week with [several record low readings](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/02/more-record-lows-in-isee.html).  This
    is normally a bullish contrarian indicator, but as I have noted here on several
    occasions, the divergence with the volatility indices is a bearish signal.

    sauvignon blancs from [Cloudy Bay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloudy_Bay_Vineyards)
    and the [Marlborough](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlborough%2C_New_Zealand)
    region of New Zealand, as well as some excellent California producers whose sauvignon
    blanc can be had locally for $10 or less: [Bogle](http://www.boglewinery.com/factsht.htm#05Sauvignon);
    [Chateau St. Jean](http://www.chateaustjean.com/stjean/catalog/view_product.jsp?product_id=1245&cat_id=1001)
    (where it goes under the fumé blanc moniker); [Concannon](http://www.concannonvineyard.com/ourWines.html);
    [Kenwood](http://www.kenwoodvineyards.com/); and [Sterling](http://www.sterlingvineyards.com/en-row/SterlingWines/wines/vintners-collection/VC-SB-03).
    More recently, I was impressed by a complex sauvignon blanc, with a little bit
    of oak, from [Gary Farrell Vineyards](http://zinandpinot.blogspot.com/2007/09/gary-farrell-vineyards-tasting-review.html).
    Their 2005 effort can be had for about $25; for my money, it knocks the socks
    off almost all of the chardonnays in that price range.'

    blended with the enthusiasm of Jim Cramer) and informative look at sauvignon blanc,
    I encourage the reader to sample Gary Vaynerchuk's "[Sauvignon Blanc Taste-Off](http://tv.winelibrary.com/2007/05/30/the-sauvignon-blanc-taste-off-episode-245/)"
    on [wine library tv](http://tv.winelibrary.com/).**
