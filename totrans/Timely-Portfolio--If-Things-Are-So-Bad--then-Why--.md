# Timely Portfolio: If Things Are So Bad, then Why??

> 来源：[http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2011/02/if-things-are-so-bad-then-why.html#0001-01-01](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2011/02/if-things-are-so-bad-then-why.html#0001-01-01)

If things are so bad, then why are stocks only down as much as the safehavens (gold, bonds, and yen) are up over the last 5 days?  This is very strange to me.
