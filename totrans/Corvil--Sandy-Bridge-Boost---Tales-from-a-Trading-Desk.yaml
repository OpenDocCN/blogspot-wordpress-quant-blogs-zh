    most of us are clear that Intel’s [Sandy Bridge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Bridge)
    CPU offers an appropriate performance jump over previous CPU’s.  It’s therefore
    of interest to see that Corvil have managed to gain a 2x [performance](http://www.hftreview.com/pg/newsfeeds/corvil/item/60580/corvil-doubles-performance-across-entire-product-range)
    increase across its entire product range by leveraging Sandy Bridge coupled with
    data compression [techniques](http://www.bigdataforfinance.com/bigdata/2012/08/corvil-brings-big-data-analysis-to-latency-management-appliance.html).

    appears to have dropped any mention of cell processors with regards their [ticker](http://www.redlinetrading.com/pdf/Redline-InRush-datasheet.pdf)
    plant.  Which either means, they have just had a marketing re-jig, or they are
    now a software solution.  If Redline are now 100% software, I wonder if Sandy
    Bridge is part of the reason for the move away from cell?
