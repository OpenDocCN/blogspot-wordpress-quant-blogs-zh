- en: Every asset class has a unique “fingerprint” for how it behaves in different
    types of scenarios. While market behavior changes over time like everything else,
    these fingerprints generally remain stable for long periods of time. *The key
    is to understand how a given market behaves when it is in certain zones.*  This
    allows you to clearly formulate what approach you should take at this point in
    time, rather than react and try to process new information as it arrives. Every
    financial instrument behaves in essentially 6 different “zones” over the longer
    term. This can be simplified by stating that the market is either trending up,
    trending down, or trendless, with either high or low volatility for each of these
    scenarios. The table below shows the historical  magnitude of returns to the S&P500
    (SPY) under each scenario, with the zones being color coded from green (best)
    to red (worst). Each zone can be delineated based on an intermediate r-square
    of high, low and close data, an intermediate  slope of the regression line reading,
    and a 30-day historical volatility ranking using percentiles (>.5 is high, <.5
    is low). For my own work I use a special indicator called the DVRAC which stands
    for R-squared and auto-correlation.  Interestingly enough the performance of different
    indicators  such as simple moving averages and oscillators is radically different
    in each of these zones. **Thus the static use of any indicator is quite silly. Optimal performance
    can be achieved by using the right indicator the right way, in the right zone.**
    Ironically for the S&P500, the use of a moving average is most effective in the
    trendless zone, while buying on small dips is more effective in uptrends, and
    shorting on small rallies is more effective in down trends except when volatility
    is very high (market returns are slightly positive with much more risk for a huge
    rally against shorts). For more research on zones and to obtain the DVRAC email
