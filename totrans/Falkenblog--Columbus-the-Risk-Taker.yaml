    the world was only three quarters as big as it really is. He also overestimated
    the eastward and distance to Asia and therefore by subtraction grossly underestimated
    the westward water distance to Asia...Given the amount of water put on board,
    without the Americas Columbus and all his men would have died of thirst and been
    unknown in our history books. Columbus goes down in history as the world's greatest
    explorer...because he found the completely unexpected, the Americas, and they
    happened to be full of gold. One moral of the story is that it is important to
    be smart, but that it is even more important to be lucky. But ultimately Columbus
    did not succeed because he was lucky. He succeeded because he made the effort
    to set sail in a direction never before taken despite a lot of resistance from
    those around him. Without that enormous effort he could not have been in the position
    to have a colossal piece of good luck.

    – you know there’s no confidence to equal it. It’s only when you know something
    about a profession, I think, that you’re timid or careful."

- en: A little delusional overconfidence is surely a good thing, but this is rather
    paradoxical because most rational people like Robin Hanson preach that knowing
    The Truth is most important, and one should always be adjusting one's opinions
    in light of our known propensity to be overconfident (eg, most of us think we
    are better than average in wit, common sense, our wisdom in politics, etc.). Too
    much rationality can make one not take chances, because while any business plan
    is often predicated on a false assumption, they often put one in a situation to
    succeed. I think the take away is to remember that getting into something plausible
    that are very good at, will present a lots of unknown option value, so don't be
    too demanding.

    with his capital provider. Note that portfolio managers can receive anything from
    a flat salary, to 50% cut of the profit, to equity ownership. It all depends on
    one''s negotiating power, because if your story is credible, and there is alpha
    there, this is a free lunch and so investors should be happy to get only 50%.
    But of course this is all speculative, and often the man with the plan has few
    rich relatives. Columbus boldly asked for the following conditional upon being
    successful: he was to be knighted, appointed Grand Admiral and Viceroy (king''s
    representative) of all the lands he discovered, and he would keep a tenth of all
    taxes levied there. Spain initially refused, so he went to France, and so Spain
    acceded his demands, and gave him two old ships (Columbus rented a third himself).
    In the end, his greed cost him, as his wild imaginings made him so unpopular that
    he king had his own viceroy and admiral arrested and brought home from the West
    Indies in chains. I suppose that all descendants of Columbus might file suit,
    asking for one-tenth of all American tax receipts.'
