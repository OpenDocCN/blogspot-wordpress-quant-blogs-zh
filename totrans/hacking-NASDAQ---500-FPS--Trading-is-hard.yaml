    Its been 5 months since quitting a good job to focus full time on HF equities
    trading and almost 2 years since finance and trading appeared on my radar. But
    never imagined in any shape or form that successful, consistently profitable trading
    would be so hard. Its not surprising... I guess, if not painfully obvious as if
    everyone could extract money from the market like this, then everyone would be
    living on a Yacht in the Bahamas... or whatever fantasy you can conjure up.

    can pickup a paintbrush/whatever and make something and put it on a wall, just
    as anyone can buy and sell stock/whatever and plot it on a chart. The difference?
    Unlike friends and family is with your Art, the market is a brutal, merciless,
    heartless bitch that tells you exactly what it thinks, blow by blow, day by day,
    no hesitation to kick you in the teeth, with cast iron steel capped boots, when
    your down and out in a pool of your own blood. Then finally, in a very polite
    and impersonal way gives  a quantifiable score every minute/hour/day/month and
    year - sounds fun eh? :P

- en: Guess its no co-incidence some of the smartest and sharpest people I`ve met
    over the last year or two are HF traders and what Ive found in nearly 2 decades
    of writing code in some shape or form is, you typically find is one, two or maybe
    three if your really lucky of these kinds of truly gifted people in your standard
    tech company/division (*1) yet it seems every successful HF trader ive met is
    one of these gifted people - none of this big dumb asshole trader image that is
    typically in popular culture.

    at charts, flows, stats, far too much hair pulling and about 5 completely re-written
    trading systems(one day will write that all up) I`m ready to jump in and start
    trading for real January 2012.
