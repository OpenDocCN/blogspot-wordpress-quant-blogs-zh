# Humble Student of the Markets: Some clarity from a "show me" week

**Mid-week market update**

: I had characterized this week as a "show me" week for the market, though I had a slight bullish bias (see

[How the market could melt up](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2019/03/24/how-the-market-could-melt-up/)

). While I remained tactically bullish, a number of unanswered questions remained in light of the yield curve related sell-off that began late last week.

Some of those questions are getting answered. The bulls are still have control of the tape, though the control remains tenuous. The most positive sign is the SPX is holding a resistance turned support zone at about 2800\. The market advance last summer was characterized by a series of "good overbought" readings on RSI-5, and pullbacks were halted when RSI-14 reached the neutral zone. The same pattern seems to be occurring today, which is constructive.
