- en: Coral8 recently implemented queryable "public windows" as a way to do ad-hoc
    queries. In order to get this feature out the door quickly, Coral8 embedded a
    version of SQLite into their system. So, you cannot use the Coral8 streaming query
    language, CCL, to do ad-hoc queries of windows. Instead, you need to use a dialect
    of SQL-92.

    data. This is something I would also like to see in Coral8\. (I guess there is
    an opportunity for a little cottage industry to be built around enhancing Coral8
    for capital markets firms...)

    deciding on Streaming SQL? (I know that JOS has been on the R bandwagon for a
    while at Barcap. He hasn't blogged too much about it recently though...)
