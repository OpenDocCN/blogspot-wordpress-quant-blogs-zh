- en: If I had to sum up what all this means, I would say that the evidence of market
    prices points to a very high level of fear, uncertainty and doubt among global
    investors. Today's record-low 10-yr Treasury yield is just the latest sign that
    investors are consumed by fears. When emotions reach such heights, as they did
    in the early 1980s and in late 2008/early 2009, investors willing to bear risk
    stand a good chance of being rewarded, provided the future turns out to be less
    awful than the market expects.
