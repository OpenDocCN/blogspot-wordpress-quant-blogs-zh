    indices and ETFs are screaming “oversold!” at the moment. One index in particular,
    the S&P 400 MidCap Index, stands out among the crowd. The MidCap Index, which
    has an ETF that trades under the ticker [MDY](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=MDY),
    has been in existence since 1995\. The chart below, courtesy of Yahoo, shows the
    performance of that index over the past 15 years. If you are looking for an overbought/oversold
    indicator, the 21 day [rate of change](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/rate%20of%20change)
    (ROC) indicator is a good one. Looking at the ROC for 2008, notice how the current
    readings are the third time this year that the ROC set a new record for negative
    ROC. Also, the current reading of -33.95 is more than double what had been seen
    prior to this year.

    bounce soon. The fact that it has not happened yet is particularly interesting
    and means that more rocket fuel is building up for that bounce. For now, however,
    the failure to launch says as much about the investor psyche as anything else.
    Only in a market with a VIX approaching 60, would a market be too fearful to bounce.
