- en: Unfortunately, another default Scrum ceremony that is often ignored is the [retrospective](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/sprint-retrospective).
     Without retrospectives the team can’t learn and improve.  Rally lists the retrospective
    [issue](https://help.rallydev.com/top-10-mistakes-teams) in its “Top 10 Mistakes
    Made by New Agile Teams”.  In my humble view the failure of a team to engage in
    a retrospective says a lot about the team failing to be/understand agile – the
    team could often be said to be simply going though some motions of pretending
    to be agile, without actually understanding and embracing agile.
