    day at the 25.66 level on September 12, 2008 – the Friday before the Lehman Brothers
    bankruptcy filing.

    volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/historical%20volatility)
    (HV) in the S&P 500 index are also at levels not seen since the week of the Lehman
    Brothers bankruptcy. These include 20 day HV (24.65), 30 day HV (25.50) and 50
    day HV (28.57). Further, while the 10 day HV has not yet fallen below recent May
    and January lows, at 21.54, this is the type of number that makes the 30+ VIX
    advocates more than a little nervous.

    in the SPX is actually the largest daily change in the past three trading days.
    For the last six sessions, the SPX has hardly moved at all, which has driven historical
    volatility – also known as realized volatility – dramatically lower.

- en: The chart below shows the trends in the VIX and historical volatility in the
    SPX since last September. Note that since the March lows the VIX has been falling
    in conjunction with the highlighted 10 day and 50 day historical volatility measures.
    Note also that the last three times 10 day HV got significantly ahead of the VIX
    (1/5, 2/5 and 5/6) each time this was a precursor to topping action in the SPX.
    As the 10 day historical volatility in the SPX gets ahead of the VIX once again,
    it is reasonable to ask whether this pattern will continue and we will see another
    topping pattern in the next few days.
