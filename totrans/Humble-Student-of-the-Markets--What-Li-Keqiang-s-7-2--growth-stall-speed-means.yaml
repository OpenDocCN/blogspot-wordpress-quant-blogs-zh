    an infrastructure and export led model to one based on the Chinese consumer. What
    was left unsaid in Li Keqiang's statement is what the authorities would do if
    growth were to slow again. Would they blink yet one more time, as they seemed
    to do in this last round of growth slowdown, and try to grow the economy using
    the same tools and stimulate infrastructure growth while ignoring its longer term
    goal of re-focusing its sources of growth?

- en: We have no idea of what kinds of shocks could cause a growth slowdown in China,
    but one example might come from the knock-on effect of the Fed's decision to taper.
    Given the RMB/USD peg, such a decision could export deflation from the US to China.
    Just consider what happened to emerging market currencies and bond markets in
    the wake of the Fed's May whisper of a taper and subsequent reversal in September.
    A disorderly unwind of the leverage built up in the China's property market has
    the potential to morph into a global financial crisis (see

    growth outlook is market friendly and bullish. It does, however, run contrary
    to their stated philosophy of slowing growth by trading off quantity for quality.
    This latest statement suggests that the glide path is shallower and risks dislocation
    should China encounter an external growth shock.
