    but I want to make sure readers are aware that I have made a number of enhancements
    to the [subscriber newsletter](http://vixandmoresubscriber.blogspot.com/). The
    most important change from a content perspective, is that instead of publishing
    two very different editions on Wednesday and Sunday, I am now combining all the
    content into one weekly issue, with new content.

    is being expanded into a more comprehensive *The Week in Review* and separate
    *Market Commentary* section. There will be an increased emphasis on a global perspective,
    macroeconomic issues and fundamental analysis.

    VIX, the *VIX and More* [Global Volatility Index](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Global%20Volatility%20Index),
    the [VXV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXV), and a number of related
    indicators, such as moving averages in the VIX, historical volatility in the SPX,
    the [VIX:VXV ratio](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%3AVXV), etc.
