    for the 1st time since September.

- en: put together some stats on how long other downtrends have remained below their
    50-day moving average. I was curious to see how the S&P has performed in the past
    when it’s risen through its 50-day moving average after spending a lengthy period
    of time below it. Is it likely to spark a buying spree?

    (Note the Average Trade column peaks at 6 weeks.) Over the 6-week period the average
    gain is only 2%. Winners gained 5% on average, which isn’t terrible. I also found
    it notable that the maximum gain was 13.75% for the subsequent 6 weeks. For some
    perspective, since the November bottom 4 weeks ago the S&P is up about 22%. For
    the market to match the performance of the last 4 weeks over the next 6 it will
    need to do about 160% better than it ahas ever done under similar circumstances.
    Looking out 15 weeks (75 days), the market still has never rallied 22% after spending
    50 or more days below the 50-day moving average.

    a trading range may be more likely than a runaway move up or down.

    periods and the gains are certainly much steadier.
