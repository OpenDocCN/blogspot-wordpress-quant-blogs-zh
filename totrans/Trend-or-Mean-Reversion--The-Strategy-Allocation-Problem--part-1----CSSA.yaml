    particulary strange cognitive bias that is highly prevalent even amongst intelligent
    people.  I think it stems for the need to eliminate cognitive dissonance:  (from
    wikepedia ) [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance)

    contradictory [ideas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idea "Idea") simultaneously.
    The “ideas” or “cognitions” in question may include [attitudes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_(psychology)
    "Attitude (psychology)") and [beliefs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief "Belief"),
    the awareness of one’s [behavior](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior "Behavior"),
    and [facts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facts "Facts"). The theory of cognitive
    dissonance proposes that people have a [motivational drive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive_theory
    "Drive theory") to reduce dissonance by changing their attitudes, beliefs, and
    behaviors, or by justifying or rationalizing their attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors.^([[1]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance#cite_note-0))
    Cognitive dissonance theory is one of the most influential and extensively studied
    theories in [social psychology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_psychology_(psychology)
    "Social psychology (psychology)").'

    both,  and in this case traders generally either follow the “trend” or “mean-reversion.” 
    My stock ranking model, the MVP which stands for momentum, value and profitability tested
    extremely well historically (and is currently successful) because it straddled
    multiple investment styles that are complimentary. My theory based on this principle
    is that in the areas where cognitive dissonance is likely to exist there is likely
    to be rich opportunity for profits. This was the basis of the Aggregate M [https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2009/11/05/trend-or-mean-reversion-why-make-a-choice-the-simple-aggregate-m-indicator/](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2009/11/05/trend-or-mean-reversion-why-make-a-choice-the-simple-aggregate-m-indicator/) Think
    of the overlap portion in any Venn Diagram of possible strategies that seem contradictory
    and you are bound to find high alpha.
