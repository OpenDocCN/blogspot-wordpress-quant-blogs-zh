    hardly new. But now the hedge fund set has joined the quest, and some big money
    and names are betting on a "cure" for aging.

    deal of friction in the field. Traditional geriatric medicine is inclined to write
    off De Grey as a nut. The nanotechnologists think the cryopreservationists are
    crazy. The cryopreservationists think the nanotechnologists are optimists living
    in a fantasy world. The hormone-rejuvenation crowd thinks the calorie restrictors
    are Spartans, and the calorie restrictors think the hormone-rejuvenation experts
    are causing cancer.

- en: '...independent researchers noted that a pill form of resveratrol—the antioxidant
    found in red wine—mimicked the effects of calorie restriction in rats that weren’t
    on a diet. Problem: Given the amount of resveratrol in red wine, and after adjusting
    for body weight and metabolism, humans would have to drink a huge amount of wine
    each day to get the same results. Still, big money is chasing the idea: The findings
    were provocative enough to allow Sirtris, a biotech startup co-founded by a Harvard
    M.D. and his venture capitalist partner, to raise about $60 million from an initial
    public offering to try to produce a pill with a highly concentrated amount of
    resveratrol.'
