- en: What should traders make of this stock market? On one hand, the S&P 500 is exhibiting
    strong positive price momentum. Not only is the index trading above its daily
    Bollinger Band (BB), it's trading above its weekly BB. In the last 10 years, there
    have been eight occasions when the S&P 500 was above its weekly BB. Most (five
    out of eight) of those instances were associated with sustained advances indicative
    of positive price momentum. The market corrected in three of the eight occasions,
    but in one of the three corrections (in early 2018), the upper BB ride persisted
    for three weeks before the market exhibited a blow-off top. That's what strong
    price momentum looks like.

    contrarian bearish.
