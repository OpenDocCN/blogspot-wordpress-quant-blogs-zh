## Teaching the kids to code

### October 11, 2007

I’ve had a couple of attempts at teaching our two sons to program. I’ve tried [pygame](http://www.pygame.org/news.html) and [squeak](http://www.squeak.org/), but neither has triggered that obsessional, can’t prise fingers away from keyboard quality. Tonight I had another go, using [scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu) from [MIT](http://www.mit.edu). It’s a marvellous visual programming environment, with a very low barrier to entry. Both the lads were hooked instantly. Strongly recommended as a first dev env. I think I might try coding up some program trading algorithms in it 😉
