    to drop its deceptive-advertising case against Capital One Bank that February
    in exchange for $749,999 — a dollar short of a statutory threshold for automatic
    deposit of settlement funds into state coffers. Hatch’s office and the defendant
    were able to pick other recipients for two-thirds of the proceeds: the Minnesota
    chapters of the Legal Aid Society and the Association of Community Organizations
    for Reform Now, ACORN. The state got $250,000 to cover its investigative costs.
    Two weeks later, ACORN endorsed Mike Hatch in his bid for the Minnesota governorship
    (he lost, this was in 2006).'

- en: how Henry Cisneros, the Clinton administration’s top housing official in the
    mid-1990s, loosened mortgage restrictions so first-time buyers could qualify for
    loans they could never get before. Then, capitalizing on a housing expansion he
    helped unleash, he joined the boards of a major builder, KB Home, and Countrywide
    Financial, joining Fannie Mae chairman James Johnson. Cisneros became a developer
    after the Clinton administration, and joining with KB (American CityVista), he
    built 428 homes for low-income buyers in what was a neglected, industrial neighborhood.
    He has financed the construction of more than 7,000 houses.

- en: ACORN, and I'm sure many groups like them representing other special interests,
    are able to game the system from the top-down using their pretext of helping the
    little guy. But it's a blatant shake-down of corporations. The politicians they
    support then perpetuate the system. All that money was not just going to Wall
    Street. A lot was siphoned off by corporate cronies with ties to government at
    all levels. It is a good thing this game is over, because the policies they are
    supporting just do not make any sense.

- en: Minnesota Governor Pawlenty recently vetoed an ACORN-sponsored bill that would
    have imposed a two-year moratorium on foreclosures in Minnesota, and pretty much
    guaranteed that no mortgage lenders would do any more business in the state. A
    foreclosure moratorium would mean that lenders holding mortgages in default would
    be forced to negotiate with borrowers to modify the loans, and ACORN “counselors”
    would have been right in the middle of these negotiations. No doubt they would
    have shaken down every mortgage lender in the country for even more money in return
    for their cooperation. This raises costs of lending, but that cost is spread around,
    unseen, while ACORN then builds its patronage system, perpetuating itself.
