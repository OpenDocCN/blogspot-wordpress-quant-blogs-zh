    in exchange for $749,999 — a dollar short of a statutory threshold for automatic
    deposit of settlement funds into state coffers. Hatch’s office and the defendant
    were able to pick other recipients for two-thirds of the proceeds: the Minnesota
    chapters of the Legal Aid Society and the Association of Community Organizations
    for Reform Now, ACORN. The state got $250,000 to cover its investigative costs.
    Two weeks later, ACORN endorsed Mike Hatch in his bid for the Minnesota governorship

    —— 这一金额低于州库自动存入和解资金的法定门槛。哈奇的办公室和被告能够选择另外三分之二的赔偿款项的受益者：明尼苏达州的“法律援助协会”和“现在改革社区组织协会”（ACORN）。州政府获得`$250,000`用于支付调查成本。两周后，ACORN支持迈克·哈奇竞选明尼苏达州州长（他失去了，这是在2006年）。

    mid-1990s, loosened mortgage restrictions so first-time buyers could qualify for
    loans they could never get before. Then, capitalizing on a housing expansion he
    helped unleash, he joined the boards of a major builder, KB Home, and Countrywide
    Financial, joining Fannie Mae chairman James Johnson. Cisneros became a developer
    after the Clinton administration, and joining with KB (American CityVista), he
    built 428 homes for low-income buyers in what was a neglected, industrial neighborhood.
    He has financed the construction of more than 7,000 houses.

- en: ACORN, and I'm sure many groups like them representing other special interests,
    are able to game the system from the top-down using their pretext of helping the
    little guy. But it's a blatant shake-down of corporations. The politicians they
    support then perpetuate the system. All that money was not just going to Wall
    Street. A lot was siphoned off by corporate cronies with ties to government at
    all levels. It is a good thing this game is over, because the policies they are
    supporting just do not make any sense.

  zh: ACORN，我确信有很多像他们一样代表其他特殊利益集团的组织，可以利用他们帮助小人物的借口从上而下操纵体制。但这是对企业的公然勒索。他们支持的政客则延续了这一体制。所有那些钱不只是被投向了华尔街。很多钱被与各级政府有关的企业亲信们所挪用。这个游戏结束是件好事，因为他们支持的政策根本就毫无道理。
- en: Minnesota Governor Pawlenty recently vetoed an ACORN-sponsored bill that would
    have imposed a two-year moratorium on foreclosures in Minnesota, and pretty much
    guaranteed that no mortgage lenders would do any more business in the state. A
    foreclosure moratorium would mean that lenders holding mortgages in default would
    be forced to negotiate with borrowers to modify the loans, and ACORN “counselors”
    would have been right in the middle of these negotiations. No doubt they would
    have shaken down every mortgage lender in the country for even more money in return
    for their cooperation. This raises costs of lending, but that cost is spread around,
    unseen, while ACORN then builds its patronage system, perpetuating itself.

  zh: 明尼苏达州州长Pawlenty最近否决了一项由ACORN发起的法案，该法案将在明尼苏达州对房产执行为期两年的暂停执行令，并几乎可以肯定地说，没有任何抵押贷款人会在该州做更多的生意。暂停执行令意味着持有违约抵押贷款的贷款人将被迫与借款人协商修改贷款，而ACORN的“顾问”将置身于这些谈判之中。毫无疑问，他们将敲诈每一个国家的抵押贷款人，以换取他们的合作。这提高了贷款成本，但这种成本是隐形的，而ACORN则建立了其保护伞系统，使其得以永续。
