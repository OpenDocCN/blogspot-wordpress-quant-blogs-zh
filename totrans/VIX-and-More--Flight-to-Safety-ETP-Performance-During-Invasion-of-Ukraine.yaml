    performance. Long volatility has been the best performer for the first two weeks,
    but is now down more than the S&P 500 Index, with a loss of over 12%. The top
    performer for the entire period is gold, which has had a fairly steady if unremarkable
    return during this period. The second-best performer is the dollar, which has
    seen a steady upside, but has consistently trailed gold. Three ETPs have also
    generated losses, following a slight uptick the first few days. The worst performer
    has been the Japanese yen and the other underperformers have been the Swiss Franc
    and 1-3 Year Treasuries.

    In my next post, I will look at some hedges that are better suited to the Russia-Ukraine
    situation and have delivered much better results.
