    groups, such as sectors, countries or regions, or market factors. The charts are
    organized into four quadrants. The typical group rotation pattern occurs in a
    clockwise fashion. Leading groups (top right) deteriorate to weakening groups
    (bottom right), which then rotate to lagging groups (bottom left), which change
    to improving groups (top left), and finally completes the cycle by improving to
    leading groups (top right) again. All of the RRG analysis is conducted in USD
    and therefore includes all currency effects in the returns.'

    (VBINX). It shows leadership by virtually all equities except China. Non-US bonds
    are in the improving quadrant. EM equities are only in the improving quadrant,
    dragged down by China in the lagging quadrant, which also contains US large-cap
    growth and Treasuries.
