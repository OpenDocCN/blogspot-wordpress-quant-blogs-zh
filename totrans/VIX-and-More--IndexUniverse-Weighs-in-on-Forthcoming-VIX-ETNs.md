# VIX and More: IndexUniverse Weighs in on Forthcoming VIX ETNs

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/01/indexuniverse-weighs-in-on-forthcoming.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/01/indexuniverse-weighs-in-on-forthcoming.html#0001-01-01)

Murray Coleman at [IndexUniverse](http://www.indexuniverse.com/) has an article up today that readers of *VIX and More* should find interesting: [Pair of VIX-Tracking ETNs on the Way](http://www.indexuniverse.com/sections/newsinfocus/5251-pair-of-vix-tracking-etns-on-the-way-.html).

The bottom line is that Barclays Capital is looking to launch two VIX [exchange traded notes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_Traded_Notes):

*   iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures (1 month)

*   iPath S&P 500 VIX Mid-Term Futures (5 months)

While the timing of the launch cannot be determined at this point, as I gather more information I will certainly have a lot to say about the informational content of these new products as well as some trading strategies.

2009 just got a lot more interesting.
