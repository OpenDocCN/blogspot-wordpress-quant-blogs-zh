    AAII survey asks respondents how they feel about the markets. The monthly survey
    asks them what they're doing with their money. The latest monthly asset allocation
    survey shows that while equity weights have fallen, they are nowhere near the
    capitulation levels seen at the bottom of the 1990, 2003, and 2008 bear markets.
    It has led to the conclusion that retail investors haven't thrown in the towel,
    which opens the door to further downside potential in stock prices.
