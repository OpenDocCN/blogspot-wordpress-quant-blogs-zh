    investors. By contrast, the book attempts to reach a broader audience. My concern
    is that maybe we bloggers don’t have the tools and vocabulary to reach a broad
    group of investors. To take an obvious example, Apple hides a lot of sophistication
    behind technology and there is an incentive for them to take that approach. In
    finance, those incentives have been ignored to date and financial services firms
    make money with complicated products and services. Something like a Vanguard balanced
    fund is a great fund for investors, but nobody is going to make a ton of money
    giving that type of advice.'
