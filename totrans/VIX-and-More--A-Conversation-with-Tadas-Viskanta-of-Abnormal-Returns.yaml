    blog](http://abnormalreturns.com/), where investors come to discover what is important
    and relevant to their world and bloggers go to see whether their efforts are sufficiently
    compelling to be included among the hand-selected links that investors pore over
    at Abnormal Returns each day. Tadas has an MBA from the University of Chicago
    and a BA from Indiana University. His first book,* *[Abnormal Returns: Winning
    Strategies from the Frontlines of the Investment Blogosphere](http://www.amazon.com/Abnormal-Returns-Strategies-Frontlines-Blogosphere/dp/0071787100),
    was published a little over one month ago by McGraw-Hill and is available in hardback
    and digitally in a Kindle edition.*'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'TV: I had a book proposal on hedge funds that had been shopped around and ultimately
    went nowhere. I had been keeping an eye on the nascent investment blogging scene
    and WordPress.com had just come online, so I figured that it must be a sign.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'TV: Purely by accident. I found out quickly I wasn’t the fastest blogger and
    that other bloggers were doing great work. It seemed natural to point to their
    work rather than do “me too” sort of work. Every blogger has to find their niche.'

    politics, which means that I also avoid economic policy issues. This frees up
    a ton of space (and time). I have blogged about the difference between a positive
    and normative blogosphere. The best posts focus on the data. I’m also getting
    better at being able to summarize stuff quickly.'

    than Abnormal Returns the blog?*'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'TV: The blog appeals to sophisticated individual investors and some institutional
    investors. By contrast, the book attempts to reach a broader audience. My concern
    is that maybe we bloggers don’t have the tools and vocabulary to reach a broad
    group of investors. To take an obvious example, Apple hides a lot of sophistication
    behind technology and there is an incentive for them to take that approach. In
    finance, those incentives have been ignored to date and financial services firms
    make money with complicated products and services. Something like a Vanguard balanced
    fund is a great fund for investors, but nobody is going to make a ton of money
    giving that type of advice.'

    to reach that broader audience of investors?*'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'TV: ETFs are one tool, but not a solution in and of themselves. As far as the
    vocabulary is concerned, it’s a process, not a one-shot deal. We all broadly have
    the same sort of goals and deal with the same sort of issues. The important thing
    is to put investors on the path of saving and investing.'

    tennis, it is important to avoid unforced errors – and specifically to avoid the
    things that can blow you up. In that regard, the three killers are leverage, complexity
    and liquidity.'

- en: 'TV: The DALBAR studies look at the way fund flows react to performance. Typically
    investors are buying high and selling low. Some of that has to do with the star
    manager system. An example is Bill Miller, where most of the money flowed into
    his fund at precisely the worst time. If you compare balanced funds, you don’t
    see as much “bad behavior.” With those types of funds, the focus seems to be more
    on overall portfolio performance, without the desire to tinker with performance.'

    lunch in investing?*'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'TV: During the 2008 financial crisis there was only one diversification play:
    U.S. Treasuries. The challenge now is that real yields on Treasuries are negative,
    so that makes diversification into Treasuries a lot less attractive. There really
    is no cheap, safe asset at the moment.'

    a good or bad thing for investors?*'

    You just need to adjust your thinking. The same can be said for any other market-related
    phenomenon. A lot of traders complain about high frequency trading, but until
    things change you have to adapt to the environment or find something else to do.'

    in the euro zone? Should they get in cash? Hedge? Ignore the news and sit tight?*'

- en: 'TV: The risk of a euro zone breakup is a big risk to the markets. But it isn’t
    all that different than other big existential risks we face. Investors need to
    have in place strategies that take into account big market moves. Trying to predict
    what happens in Europe is a tough game, so having in place a plan before things
    happen is key. The likelihood you will make sound decisions in the midst of a
    crisis is pretty small.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'TV: The financial crisis scared a lot of people out of the stock market. The
    great appeal of options is that they can be used to create structured returns
    that remove down side risk. I’m not crazy about how options are marketed. For
    instance, some try to say that covered calls are “income.” This is not correct.
    The money received for selling covered calls is really compensation for foregoing
    the possibility of potential gains.'

    such returns are not sustainable? Other issues?*'

    how when we examine investment returns we are looking at some mix of skill and
    luck. Nobody wants to pay a manager for luck, but teasing out who has skill is
    no easy matter.

    That is why it is important to have a strategy to either eliminate or at least
    filter the noise. Going on a news-free diet can serve this purpose for investors.
    Most investors have long investing horizons; therefore it makes sense for them
    to avoid the intraday noise that dominates the financial media.'

    money is enough. There are no right or wrong answers. That is why we call it ‘personal
    finance.’ Investors should try to push all of the buttons and pull all of the
    levers that they can to put the odds in their favor. Today’s low yield, low return
    environment makes this all the more important.'

    consumption than it is to generate an additional 1% portfolio alpha, for instance.
    As far as investments are concerned, find incremental returns where you can, including
    areas such as harvesting tax losses. Ultimately, everyone must understand there
    are no guarantees.'
