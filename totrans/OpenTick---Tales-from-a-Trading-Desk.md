# OpenTick | Tales from a Trading Desk

> 来源：[https://mdavey.wordpress.com/2006/12/01/opentick/#0001-01-01](https://mdavey.wordpress.com/2006/12/01/opentick/#0001-01-01)

## OpenTick

If Microsoft really want to get investment banks to buy into WPF (.NET 3.0) then I suggest they look at [Eclipse Trader](http://eclipsetrader.sourceforge.net/) and then build something with WPF+[OpenTick](http://www.opentick.com/). WPF should be able to provide far superior charts compare to what is available in [Eclipse Trader](http://eclipsetrader.sourceforge.net/screenshot2.gif).
