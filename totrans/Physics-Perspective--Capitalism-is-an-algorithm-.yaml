- en: over at Medium on one particular aspect of their article -- the notion that
    capitalism is best understood as an evolutionary process for finding solutions
    to human problems. It's messy, wasteful, chaotic, and that's precisely why it
    works -- by allowing a parallel exploration by many minds of the huge space of
    possible solutions to human problems. Capitalism is an algorithm in much the way
    evolution is an algorithm (or at least is LIKE an algorithm).
