# Quantifiable Edges: Fed Days After Large Drops

> 来源：[http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2011/11/fed-days-after-large-drops.html#0001-01-01](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2011/11/fed-days-after-large-drops.html#0001-01-01)

While Fed Days have historically provided an upside edge, that edge has been substantially more powerful when there has been strong selling the day before. The last time I showed this study on the blog

[was 4/28/10](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2010/04/strong-drops-just-before-fed-day.html)

. I've updated the statistics below.

Instances are a bit low, but they couldn’t get much more bullish. With a profit factor over 11 and the average trade about as positive as the worst trade was negative, risk/reward appears to heavily favor the bulls.

With the makret gapping up large this morning it may be too late to take advantage of this one. I did send a Tweet yesterday afternoon linking to the Fed Day studies where astute readers would have found this study posted in April of 2010\.
