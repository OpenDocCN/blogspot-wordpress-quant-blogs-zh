# VIX and More: 1 + 1 = 1987?

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/04/1-1-1987.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/04/1-1-1987.html#0001-01-01)

Though this blog is ostensibly about volatility, I try not to inject too much of the perma-bear melodrama into what I write, but I would remiss if I didn't point to some alternative opinions from time to time.

Take two posts I just happened upon.

Libby Mahalka of [Financial Pragmatist](http://financialpragmatist.blogspot.com/) has a nice review of the [divergence between risk as measured by the VIX and the shrinking risk premium available in the bond markets](http://financialpragmatist.blogspot.com/2007/04/return-of-volatility.html), as evidenced by credit spreads.

Meanwhile, Barry Ritholtz at [The Big Picture](http://bigpicture.typepad.com/) looks at a big picture of [2007 vs. 1987](http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2007/04/1987_versus_200.html).

Now put these two ideas together...

For the record, I'm not hitting the panic button. I don't even have my hand near the button. Instead, I prefer to take my cues from what the market is actually doing rather than what I think it might do. Then again, it is always good to know how some others in the market are thinking about potential future scenarios.
