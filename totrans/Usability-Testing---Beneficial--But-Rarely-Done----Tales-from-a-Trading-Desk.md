## Usability Testing – Beneficial, But Rarely Done?

Interesting read over on [Referly](http://refer.ly/blog/usability-testing-for-startups/) on Usability Testing.  Financial application have got a lot better over the years with regards to engaging User Experience (UX) architects to design user interfaces.  Unfortunately, I still think the financial vertical is behind on seeing the benefit of usability testing, especially with regards to the reduction in development time based on testing the UX prior to development starting.
