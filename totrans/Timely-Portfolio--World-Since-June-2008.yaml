    since June 2008.  I used R to produce this (*I amended this post to reflect a
    prettier forked version as discussed in the comments)*, but I’m still not completely
    satisfied. Anyone have suggestions to improve?

    move through the financial collapse low 2.15% seen in December 2008 and significantly
    lower than the 2.87% at the S&P low March 2009.  I think both can be explained
    by an illusion of control assigned to the US.  This illusion begins to unravel
    if the political process fails and monetary policy has reached its limits.
