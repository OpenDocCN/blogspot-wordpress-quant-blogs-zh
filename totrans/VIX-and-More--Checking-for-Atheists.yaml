    when I see the markets bounce is what I call my “atheist check.”  Essentially,
    I take a look at the current and recent numbers for the [ISEE](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/ISEE)
    to see if there are many believers who are flocking to buy call options.  The
    lower the number, the more atheists there are that are still out there (or ‘undecideds’
    if you prefer the political metaphor to the religious one), and therefore the
    larger number of potential converts available.  Contrarians love potential converts,
    as they are the future fuel for subsequent bull legs.  Generally, when I see an
    ISEE number (they use a call to put ratio, not a put to call ratio like the CBOE
    does) of 120 or below, I consider this to be a bullish signal.  An ISEE of under
    100, which signifies more people opening new put positions than call positions,
    is very bullish.'

    periods.  What I find noteworthy about the current market is that the ISEE has
    closed below 100 for five of the past six days and at 92 as of 12:50 EST today,
    is on target to make that six of seven.  The only other time that the ISEE has
    registered six of seven sub-100 closes since the exchange began keeping records
    in October 2002 is in [August 2007](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007_08_01_archive.html),
    at the very bottom of the selloff caused by the first iteration of a [subprime](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/subprime%20mortgage)
    panic.

    37.50 VIX spike we had in August.  While the VIX demonstrates how fearful the
    atheists are, the ISEE reveals how many of them are out there and reminds me of
    one of my favorite quotes, which comes from John Bender and appears in Jack Schwager’s
    [Stock Market Wizards](http://www.amazon.com/Stock-Market-Wizards-Interviews-Americas/dp/0066620597),
    “*It's not the current opinion of the stock that matters, but rather the potential
    change in the opinion.”*
