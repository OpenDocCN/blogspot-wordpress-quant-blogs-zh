Every asset class has a unique “fingerprint” for how it behaves in different types of scenarios. While market behavior changes over time like everything else, these fingerprints generally remain stable for long periods of time. *The key is to understand how a given market behaves when it is in certain zones.*  This allows you to clearly formulate what approach you should take at this point in time, rather than react and try to process new information as it arrives. Every financial instrument behaves in essentially 6 different “zones” over the longer term. This can be simplified by stating that the market is either trending up, trending down, or trendless, with either high or low volatility for each of these scenarios. The table below shows the historical  magnitude of returns to the S&P500 (SPY) under each scenario, with the zones being color coded from green (best) to red (worst). Each zone can be delineated based on an intermediate r-square of high, low and close data, an intermediate  slope of the regression line reading, and a 30-day historical volatility ranking using percentiles (>.5 is high, <.5 is low). For my own work I use a special indicator called the DVRAC which stands for R-squared and auto-correlation.  Interestingly enough the performance of different indicators  such as simple moving averages and oscillators is radically different in each of these zones. **Thus the static use of any indicator is quite silly. Optimal performance can be achieved by using the right indicator the right way, in the right zone.** Ironically for the S&P500, the use of a moving average is most effective in the trendless zone, while buying on small dips is more effective in uptrends, and shorting on small rallies is more effective in down trends except when volatility is very high (market returns are slightly positive with much more risk for a huge rally against shorts).
