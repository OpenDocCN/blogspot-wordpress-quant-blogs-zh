# VIX and More: Two Interesting Perspectives on the VIX

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/08/two-interesting-perspectives-on-vix.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/08/two-interesting-perspectives-on-vix.html#0001-01-01)

In my scramble to get caught up with what others have been saying about the markets, two VIX-related posts in particular have captured my attention.

It should come as no surprised that one of them comes from [Bernie Schaeffer](http://www.schaeffersresearch.com/), a regular in this space, whose "[Examining Sentiment in the Context of a Market Pullback](http://www.schaeffersresearch.com/commentary/observations.aspx?ID=19898)" concludes:

> "Pullbacks to support levels in a bull market when accompanied by climactic fear levels are almost always buying opportunities, and this diagnosis applies today. This does not necessarily mean today was the bottom, but it does strongly imply that it would be foolish to exit this market in response to the gloom and doom headlines."

I was also interested to see what [Mark Longo](http://tradersmagazine.com/search.cfm?submit=yes&freetxt=longo&x=10&y=9), a long time contributor to [Trader's Magazine](http://tradersmagazine.com/index.cfm), thinks of the VIX in the context of the current market. Writing for [The Options Insider](http://www.theoptionsinsider.com/), Longo provides some interesting historical context for the VIX and wonders aloud if we are entering a new era of continued high volatility. Looking at some of the VIX options action, he points out that "the so-called 'smart money' is betting that the current volatility trend will continue, at least in the near-term." Siding with the smart money crowd, Longo concludes:
 > "...with oil and credit concerns looming on the horizon, it certainly appears as though the VIX may have finally awakened from its long slumber." These are two perspectives are recommended reading, along with those of a dozen VIX-fluent bloggers:

...as well as others I'm sure I have accidentally overlooked.
