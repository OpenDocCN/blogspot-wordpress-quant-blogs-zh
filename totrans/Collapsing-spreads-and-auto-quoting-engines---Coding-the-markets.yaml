    on bid ask spreads. As always with Harris, it’s highly enlightening and thought
    provoking. I commented earlier on how the [dynamic equilibrium between market
    and limit orders](https://etrading.wordpress.com/2006/09/07/market-orders-and-limit-orders/)
    affects spreads, and how [eSpeed charges for market orders](https://etrading.wordpress.com/2006/09/08/espeed-market-orders/)
    in order to minimise spreads. Later in ch 14 he goes on to enumerate the factors
    that determine the equilibrium spread in order driven markets. In decreasing order
    of importance they are: information asymmetry between traders, time to cancel
    limit orders, volatility, limit order management costs, value of trader time,
    difference between limit and market order fees and trader risk aversion.'

    income rates markets in recent years; by 80% in the last five years, according
    to some estimates. A lot of that must have been driven by the greater transparency
    of electronic markets: buy side clients like pension funds can see live ticking
    prices for euro govies on [Bloomberg](http://www.bloomberg.com) and [TradeWeb](http://www.tradeweb.com),
    and initiate competitive multi-dealer auctions.'

    Harris’ thoughts on equilibrium spreads don’t all apply, especially the ones on
    limit order cancellation and management costs. For the order driven markets, like
    Eurex Bonds, eSpeed and MTS, I wonder how much of the collapse in spreads is due
    to autoquoting engines driving down the cost of limit order management.

    ask prices and sizes into buy and sell orders on order driven markets. When the
    bid and ask change, the engine pulls and places buy and sell orders as necessary.
    One autoquoting engine vendor used widely by fixed income dealers is [ION](http://www.iontrading.com/).

    Dealers may yearn for the days of voice quoting, limited transparency and wide
    spreads. But there’s no going back. Autoquoting engines almost totally eliminate
    the time to cancel limit orders, and the costs of managing those orders – apart
    from any fees. If we accept Harris’ arguments, the use of autoquoting engines
    must bear down on the equilibrium spread.
