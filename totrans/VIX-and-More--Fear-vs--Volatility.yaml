- en: Astute observers may have noticed several instances over the past few days where
    VIX tops and market bottoms have parted company.  Part of the reason for this
    is that the fear component of the VIX has recently grown large enough that it
    has sometimes overshadowed the volatility component.  We have a lot of volatility
    at the moment, but we have more fear than we have seen in a very long time.

  zh: 敏锐的观察者可能会注意到在过去几天中，VIX顶部和市场底部有几次分道扬镳。部分原因是VIX的恐慌成分最近变得足够大，以至于它有时会盖过波动性成分。我们此刻有很多波动性，但我们看到的恐惧比过去很长一段时间都要多。
- en: It is difficult to decompose fear and volatility by looking at charts, but one
    worth examining is the ratio of the VIX to the [SDS](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=sds&hl=en),
    which is the 2x inverse ETF of the SPX.  The graphic below is a 10 day chart with
    30 minute bars, with the SPX behind it in gray.  It shows the type of mirror image
    you would expect between volatility and market movements up until the latter stages
    of Wednesday’s session.  From that point on, the formerly predictable negative
    correlation becomes significantly muddier, to the point where today’s session
    shows the ratio way out of proportion to the market downdrafts.

  zh: 通过查看图表很难将恐惧和波动性分解，但值得研究的一个比例是VIX对[SDS](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=sds&hl=en)的比率，SDS是SPX的2x反向ETF。下面的图表是一个10天的图表，带有30分钟的时间段，SPX在灰色背景中。它显示了波动性和市场运动之间的预期镜像，直到周三晚些时候。从那时起，原本可预测的负相关性变得显著混乱，以至于今天的会议显示该比率与市场下跌幅度不成比例。
- en: Some of this decoupling is clearly traders buying puts to protect themselves
    against Monday’s headline risk, but I do not believe this is the entire story.  As
    the markets have rallied during the course of the day, the VIX to SDS ratio has
    remained stubbornly higher, suggesting that the fear component of the VIX may
    now be the tail wagging the volatility dog.  I will see if I can do a better job
    of coming up with graphical data to support my contention, but you can now see
    and feel the fear in the markets, even if it is not that easy to isolate it in
    the charts.

  zh: 一些去耦现象显然是交易员购买看跌期权以保护自己免受周一头条风险的影响，但我认为这并不是整个故事。随着市场在当天晚些时候的上涨，VIX对SDS的比率固执地维持在较高水平，这表明VIX的恐慌成分可能现在已经成了波动性狗的尾巴。我会看看我是否能更好地提出图表数据来支持我的观点，但即使它在图表中不容易被孤立，你现在已经可以感受到市场中的恐惧。
