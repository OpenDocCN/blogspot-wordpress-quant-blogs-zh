# VIX and More: The Upcoming 2012 CBOE Risk Management Conference

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2012/02/upcoming-2012-cboe-risk-management.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2012/02/upcoming-2012-cboe-risk-management.html#0001-01-01)

Last year I had the pleasure of attending the 27^(th) annual [CBOE Risk Management Conference](http://www.cboermc.com/) and wrote about that experience in [The VIX Summit, a.k.a. the CBOE Risk Management Conference](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2011/03/vix-summit-aka-cboe-risk-management.html).

Some of my comments on last year’s conference include:

> *“I have little doubt that if VIXophiles were only to attend one conference per year, this would be the one.”*
> 
> *“Where else can you find several hundred like-minded souls who obsess about the VIX and volatility on a daily basis?”*
> 
> *“Where else could you holler out ‘Hey, Mr. VIX?’ in a crowded room and expect at least a dozen heads to turn?”*

The 2012 version of the CBOE Risk Management Conference is being held at the Hyatt Regency Coconut Point Resort and Spa at Bonita Springs, Florida and runs from March 11-13.  This year’s [agenda](http://www.cboermc.com/Agenda.cfm) looks to be an interesting one and includes sessions such as:

*   Today’s Volatility Environment and What to Do About It
*   Options-Based Strategy Benchmarks
*   Technical vs. Fundamental Drivers of Volatility
*   How to Manage Tail Risk and Add Alpha
*   Dispersion and Correlation Trading: What Worked, When, Why, and How?
*   Cross-Asset Volatility
*   Options Pricing Theory Revisited and the Impact on Long-Dated Index Options
*   Smart Hedging and Alpha Generation with VIX Options

In addition, the conference also offers two parallel introductory tracks for investors and traders that consist of three sessions each and are intended to provide those who are relatively new to the subject matter with a strong foundation in advance of the general presentations noted above.

If you trade VIX products and you want to find out what some of the top practitioners in the field are thinking and doing, the CBOE Risk Management Conference is a great place to get that information first-person and do some networking in the process.

*[While a family conflict will prevent me from attending this year’s conference, I intend to make this a conference part of my annual southern migration, as it is in Florida in the even years and southern California in the odd years.]*
