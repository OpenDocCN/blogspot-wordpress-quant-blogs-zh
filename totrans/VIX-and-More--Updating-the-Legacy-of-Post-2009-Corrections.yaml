- en: Of all the periodic themes that I update in this space, the one that always
    surprises me by how strong of a reception it generates is a table that I call
    the *VIX and More 2009-12 SPX Peak to Trough Pullback Summary* – of which a current
    version is appended below.

- en: The table is a chronology of sorts of all the significant pullbacks since the
    March 2009 bottom in stocks. I have tweaked the definition of pullback a little
    so that it only includes pullbacks from new highs. For that reason, there are
    no significant pullbacks since the SPX made a new high for the year back on September
    6^(th). That being said, I am including the price action of the last two days
    as a provisional entry in red at the bottom of the table, with data as of one
    quarter of an hour to go in the trading day. Generally it takes a pullback of
    at least 2.5% - 3.0% to warrant inclusion in this table.

- en: I suspect that the main reason investors enjoy this table is that it gives them
    some historical context for how the markets have recently been pulling back and
    thus helps to set expectations about how far the current or subsequent correction
    may extend. Prior to the current mini-pullback, the median pullback was 5.6%,
    while the mean pullback stood at 7.4%, thanks to several sharper corrections.
    Applied to Friday’s high of SPX 1474, these translate to a pullback to SPX 1392
    or SPX 1365, respectively. Of course, this is where the “past performance is no
    guarantee of future results” type of disclaimer should be inserted, but historical
    parameters can help to set expectations.

    the current direction of the market even more difficult and perilous than usual.

    months, investors cannot be faulted for exhibiting more than the usual amount
    of caution during the remainder of the year.

    that the market has been wrong about a recent bullish move and it is time for
    cooler heads and more reasonable valuations to have their way. Certainly there
    is no reason why there cannot be these same type of “corrections” when markets
    become oversold, but good luck finding those who talk about stocks correcting
    upward.]'
