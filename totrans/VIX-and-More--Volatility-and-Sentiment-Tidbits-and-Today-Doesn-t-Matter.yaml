    up to 1.12 at 1:12 p.m. EDT (I’m not superstitious, but that’s an interesting
    bullish signal)

    (volatility index for the [NDX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/NDX)
    or NASDAQ-100) spiked over 34 on Friday and made it as high as 33.76 earlier today.  That’s
    not enough to satisfy the “VIX must spike over 30!” purists, but it is an interesting
    data point, particularly because the VXN and NDX excludes financials

    do not equal one large capitulation-friendly VIX spike

    until the tone of the news flow changes, regardless of market technicals and sentiment
    data.  There must be several bullish macroeconomic and/or fundamental data points
    which collectively give the bulls a reason not to be so skittish.  At a minimum,
    the markets need to navigate the PPI, CPI, industrial production and capacity
    utilization data due out tomorrow and Wednesday, then weather the flood of earnings
    reports (with strong representation from some key financial institutions) on Thursday.  Even
    then, there is the Citigroup ([C](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=c)) earnings
    story on Friday morning.
