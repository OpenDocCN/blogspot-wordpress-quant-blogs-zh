  zh: 戈德尔说，
- en: '"We did a comprehensive evaluation of different OMS/EMS solution providers
    in the CEP space. Our goal was first to discern if a CEP solution was appropriate
    for our firm, then also determine which of these CEP solution providers were most
    well suited to our development paradigm and the kinds of analysis we’d need to
    be able to do to execute our strategies in the market. We looked at a number of
    providers, including Progress Apama, Coral8, Aleri and StreamBase, and we drilled
    down on these and tried to figure out what aspects of these different solutions
    were interesting to us. We’re a very heavily technology focused firm, not just
    for performance reasons but also because the algorithm, the process is our strategy,
    this is a fully automated process at its core, the code we developed to build
    our process is the product itself, and as such we need tools that enable us to
    build our product that will allow us to focus on the business problems without
    having to worry so much about the implementation details of the internals of databases.
    At the same time, we’re concerned to make sure we have tools we need.Some of these
    CEP solutions seem like completely packaged solutions that strive to deliver complete
    trading algos against the market that will achieve low market impact etc., we’re
    not looking for that sort of thing because we are in the business of designing
    algorithms that get the best execution. So those are right out of the box. Streambase’s
    support paradigm we considered appropriate because Streambase is suited to working
    with developers, people who are actually able to build systems and algos that
    will achieve the kinds of detailed and specific execution properties we want.
    They have the infrastructure in place to work with us to make sure that what we’re
    trying to achieve is feasible given the internals of their database. This is one
    of the important characteristics that made Streambase win for us. The extractions
    were clean, it didn’t seem like they built their system around satisfying the
    needs of a small number of clients, the Streambase system is a platform for developing
    solutions, it’s not a solution itself. The idea of using a platform was extremely
    appropriate for our needs, because our goal is not to buy a packaged solution,
    our goal is to develop something using well-designed, modular tools and Streambase’s
    well designed, modular tools were appropriate."'

  zh: '"我们在CEP领域的不同OMS/EMS解决方案提供商进行了全面的评估。我们的目标是首先判断CEP解决方案是否适合我们公司，然后确定这些CEP解决方案提供商中哪个最适合我们的开发范式以及我们需要进行的分析类型，以便在市场中执行我们的战略。我们考虑了包括Progress
    Apama、Coral8、Aleri和StreamBase在内的多家供应商，并对这些供应商进行了深入研究，试图弄清楚这些不同解决方案的哪些方面对我们来说是有趣的。我们是一家非常注重技术的公司，这不仅仅是因为性能原因，还因为算法、流程就是我们的战略，这是一个核心完全自动化的流程，我们所开发的代码构建了我们的流程，这个流程本身就是产品，因此我们需要工具来构建我们的产品，让我们能够专注于商业问题，而无需过多担心数据库内部实现的细节。与此同时，我们关心确保我们有所需的工具。一些CEP解决方案似乎是完全的包装解决方案，旨在针对市场提供完整的交易算法，以实现低市场影响等目标，我们不需要那种东西，因为我们业务的算法设计是为了获得最佳执行。所以这些解决方案是即插即用的。我们考虑Streambase的支持范式是合适的，因为Streambase适合与开发者合作，那些实际上能够构建实现我们所需详细和具体执行属性的系统和算法的开发者。他们有基础设施可以与我们合作，确保我们在他们数据库的内部情况下能够实现我们所尝试达成的目标。这是我们选择Streambase的重要特征之一。提取干净，看起来他们并没有围绕满足少数客户的需求来构建他们的系统，Streambase系统是一个解决方案开发平台，它本身不是解决方案。使用平台的想法非常符合我们的需求，因为我们的目标不是购买一个包装解决方案，我们的目标是使用设计良好、模块化的工具开发一些东西，而Streambase设计良好、模块化的工具是合适的。"'

- en: '"The process we went through was we selected a universe of potentials, we collected
    information about them the best we could with phone calls, researching websites,
    we went to conferences in New York, we did a little narrowing at that stage, we
    had detailed demos and interaction with the teams from the companies Jeff mentioned,
    we then narrowed that down to our final two: Streambase and Aleri. We had extensive,
    on-site working sessions with both of those teams and we did a thorough evaluation
    of the support paradigm and got under the covers with developers from both companies,
    that took about two months."'

    和 Aleri。我们与这两个团队的进行了广泛的现场工作会话，并对支持模式进行了彻底的评估，与两家公司的开发者进行了深入交流，这个过程大约持续了两个月。"'
- en: I have no reason to believe Eric or Geoff were lying, nor do I have a way of
    checking whether they downloaded other CEP vendors' software. They didn't actually
    claim that they downloaded every CEP solution in their evaluation. The CEP vendors
    who are attacking this story would be better served by getting Wall Street customer
    wins and getting those customers to speak on the record so that I can write case
    studies about them.

  zh: 我没有理由相信埃里克或杰夫在说谎，我也无法查证他们是否下载了其他CEP供应商的软件。他们并没有声称在评估过程中下载了每一款CEP解决方案。那些攻击这个故事的CEP供应商们如果能拿到华尔街的客户案例，并让这些客户公开讲话，这样我就可以为他们写案例分析了。
