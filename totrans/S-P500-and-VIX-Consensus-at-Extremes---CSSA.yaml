    of Trading the Odds: [http://www.tradingtheodds.com/2010/02/vix-surges-20-as-fear-returns/](http://www.tradingtheodds.com/2010/02/vix-surges-20-as-fear-returns/) 
    In this post, Frank presents his standard approach to measuring the edge of a
    given setup. He does a very good job of crunching the numbers for all to see on
    a daily basis. In this case, the VIX surging over 20% in one day was the setup
    described. In general the analysis is very thorough, and the new additions to
    the setup evaluation framework that Frank recently built in are definitely a good
    improvement. That said, long-time readers know that I prefer not to use fixed
    percentage trading rules etc since they are not normalized within the context
    of a particular environment.'

    redundant. Generally speaking, I have found little value in using the VIX as an
    overbought/oversold indicator to trade the S&P500  in lieu of using the S&P500
    directly (however the divergences between the two are very valuable).  ***In this
    case, my central question was whether there was information that could be derived
    from a consensus between the S&P500 and VIX at extremes.*** Could looking at both
    together produce superior information concerning a short-term bottom than either
    in isolation? To run this test I used the last 5000 bars of data on both the S&P500
    index and the VIX  from Yahoo Finance. I took the one day returns for the VIX
    and normalized them using a 50-day percentile ranking, I did the same for the
    S&P500–only I subtracted the final number from 1 to account for the negative correlation
    between the two. Thus the worst days in the S&P500 were 90th percentile and higher
    using this method. Similarly, the biggest up days for the VIX were also represented
    by high percentile values. Lets look at the numbers:'

- en: As you can clearly see, consensus indeed helps to confirm temporary market bottoms
    (at least for a 1-day hold). Combining both screens produced higher next day returns,
    higher winning percentages and lower risk of an adverse loss. However, while not
    shown, this “consensus” method does not help add any value outside of the extremes.
    Apparently, bottoms require BOTH a major spike in the fear gauge and a major loss
    for the S&P500 which in hindsight makes sense.
