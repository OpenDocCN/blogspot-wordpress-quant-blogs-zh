    did cause harm. Maybe speculation did cause the housing bubble. Maybe speculation
    did cause an energy price bubble. In the same vein, you can also argue that driving
    is a harmful human activity because cars did cause a few horrific traffic accidents.

    evidence. On the other hand, as an ex-physicist and an Einstein-devotee, I can
    imagine some  thought experiments (or

    speculation can clearly be detrimental to the interests of the much-beloved long-term
    investors. To make a point, a gedankenexperiment is usually constructed so that
    the conditions are extreme and unrealistic. So here I will assume that the financial
    transaction tax is so onerous that no hedge funds and other short-term traders
    exist anymore.

    like to buy one of her favorite stocks in her retirement account. Unfortunately,
    on the day she placed her order, a major mutual fund was rebalancing its portfolio
    and had also decided to shift assets into that stock. In the absence of hedge
    funds and other speculators selling or even shorting this stock, the price of
    that stock went up 40% from the day before. Not knowing that the cause of this
    spike was a temporary liquidity squeeze, and afraid that she would have to pay
    even more in the future, Ms. Smith paid the ask price and bought the stock that
    day. A week later, the stock price fell 45% from the peak after the mutual fund
    buying subsided. Ms. Smith was mortified.'

    (due to the lack of speculators!) and opted to invest his savings into mutual
    funds instead. He took a look at his favorite mutual fund''s performance, and
    unfortunately, its recent performance seemed to be quite a few notches below its
    historical average. The fund manager explained on her website that since her fund
    derived its superior performance from rapidly liquidating holdings in companies
    that announced poor earnings, the absence of liquidity in the stock market often
    forced her to sell into an abyss. Disgusted, Mr. Smith opted to keep his savings
    in his savings account.'

    deprive the market of all speculators (only the bad ones!?). But has anyone studied
    if we impose 1 unit of tax, how many units of liquidity in the marketplace will
    be drained, and in turn, how many additional units of transaction costs (which
    include implicit costs due to the increased volatility of securities) would be
    borne by an average investor, who may not have the luxury of submitting a limit
    order and waiting for the order to be filled?
