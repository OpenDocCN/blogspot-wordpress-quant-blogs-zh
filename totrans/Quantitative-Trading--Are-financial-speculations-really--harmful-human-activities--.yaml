    like to buy one of her favorite stocks in her retirement account. Unfortunately,
    on the day she placed her order, a major mutual fund was rebalancing its portfolio
    and had also decided to shift assets into that stock. In the absence of hedge
    funds and other speculators selling or even shorting this stock, the price of
    that stock went up 40% from the day before. Not knowing that the cause of this
    spike was a temporary liquidity squeeze, and afraid that she would have to pay
    even more in the future, Ms. Smith paid the ask price and bought the stock that
    day. A week later, the stock price fell 45% from the peak after the mutual fund
    buying subsided. Ms. Smith was mortified.'

    if we impose 1 unit of tax, how many units of liquidity in the marketplace will
    be drained, and in turn, how many additional units of transaction costs (which
    include implicit costs due to the increased volatility of securities) would be
    borne by an average investor, who may not have the luxury of submitting a limit

  zh: 当然，我们的经济学家会表示，税收并不如此繁重，以至于会剥夺市场所有的投机者（只有那些不好的投机者！？）。但是，有没有人研究过，如果我们征收1单位的税，市场上会有多少单位的流动性被抽走，进而，平均投资者将承担多少额外的交易成本（这包括由于证券波动性增加而产生的隐性成本）呢？他们可能没有条件提交限价订单并等待订单成交。
