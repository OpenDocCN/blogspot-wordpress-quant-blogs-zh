    below, which reflects all dividends and also begins from the date of the Lehman
    Brothers bankruptcy filing. This time around, instead of updating the StockCharts.com
    graphic, I have elected to use an ETFreplay.com chart, as it adds some numbers
    to the chart, notably total return statistics as well as historical volatility
    and drawdown data.

    trading 8.1% above its pre-Lehman level and comfortably above the April 2010 high.
    On the other hand, the highly correlated industrial/office real estate ETF (FIO)
    and retail real estate ETF (RTL) are still both more than 15% below their pre-Lehman
    levels and are struggling to move above their April 2010 highs.

    assist investors in understanding which parts of the real estate market are showing
    relative strength and which are demonstrating relative weakness.
