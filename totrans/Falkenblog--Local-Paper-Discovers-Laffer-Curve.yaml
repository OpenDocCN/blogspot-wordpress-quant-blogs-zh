    rich.' Recently we voted in a Democrat governor and both houses of our state legislature,
    so we are getting higher taxes as expected. What wasn't expected was higher taxes
    on newspapers and the business they contract with, so now we have new Tea Party
    converts. From the

    services, a tax idea the Star Tribune has long opposed. While expanding the consumption
    sales tax to a larger share of the economy and reducing its overall rate, as Dayton
    proposes, is sound tax policy, taxing businesses' service inputs is anything but.
    ... Consider the impact on one particular industry sector -- one this Editorial
    Board serves and understands well -- advertising, information and communications.
    Providers of those services together employ nearly 68,000 Minnesotans. Many of
    them serve clients outside Minnesota and compete with rivals around the country
    and the globe.

    don't remember any such argument, though it's a nice attempt to try to present
    themselves as having a principled stance. Their basic argument is that this will
    actually reduce revenue because Minnesota businesses, including the Star-Tribune,
    will shrink as they raise their prices. But they don't state that so explicitly,
    rather, they allude to it via mentioning competitiveness, and then perfunctorily,
    that this isn't fair.

    amount, ignoring that rich people can alter their liabilities by moving headquarters,
    the structure of their various corporations, and lots of other ways. I think the
    Laffer curve is one of the more powerful ideas in macroeconomics, and also one
    of the most ridiculed. At the margin, there always appears to be more revenue
    out there by raising taxes. It reminds me of a famous essay by George Stigler
