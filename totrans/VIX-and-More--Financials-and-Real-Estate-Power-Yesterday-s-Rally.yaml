    led by the [financial](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLF) and real

    were also disproportionately strong during yesterday’s rally.  While most of yesterday’s

    the coming days and weeks will have a lot to say about whether yesterday’s big
    move has legs, with financial and real estate stocks acting as an [indicator species](http://science.jrank.org/pages/3553/Indicator-Species.html)
