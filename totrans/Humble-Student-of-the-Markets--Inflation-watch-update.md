# Humble Student of the Markets: Inflation watch update

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2009/04/inflation-watch-update.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2009/04/inflation-watch-update.html#0001-01-01)

Further to last week’s post entitled the

[Third Way in the inflation/deflation debate](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2009/04/third-way-in-inflationdeflation-debate.html)

, I offer the following updates:

Paul Wilmott, over at his

[blog](http://www.wilmott.com/blogs/paul/index.cfm/2009/4/23/Tax-Cut-Sell-Or)

, suggests that given the fiscal problems that face Her Majesty’s Government in the UK, HMG has only a few policy options:

*   Raise taxes;
*   Cut spending (difficult for a Labor government);
*   Sell the family silver; or
*   Inflate

Which do you think is the most politically painless?

Bloomberg also reports that the [U.S. more than quadruples borrowing as tax revenue drops](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601109&sid=anA.WOxto6qQ&refer=home). How will they finance this debt? How will they crawl out of this debt hole?

If you didn’t see it already, read the [Confessions of a TARP wife](http://www.portfolio.com/executives/2009/04/21/Confessions-of-a-Bailout-CEO-Wife?page=1#page=1) in order to keep an eye on how social attitudes change.

**Free newsletter for Inflation bulls** I reiterate my offer: I have begun a longer email list for inflation bulls. There is no cost and I will keep your email address to myself. Drop me a line and sign up [here](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2009/04/for-commodity-bulls.html).
