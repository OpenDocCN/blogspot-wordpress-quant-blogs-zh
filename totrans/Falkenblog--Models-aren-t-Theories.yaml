- en: A theory is is an analytic structure designed to explain a set of empirical
    observations. It should be nontautological, tautologies are for theorems. A good
    theory identifies a relation so that one can simplify or predict better than without
    the theory, and 'better' might be because of a lower mean-squared error, or because
    the simpler model makes it easier to intuit a solution using one's own wet neural
    net. A good theory can often be modeled, though not all theories are helped by
    modeling (eg, the theory 'power corrupts', or 'the invisible hand').

    mathematicians axiomatize the principles of logic use an interpretation to model
    reality. As economic systems do not have the precision of physical systems (there
    are no fundamental constants analogous to the force of gravity on Earth, no equations
    as strict as PV=nrt), I think economic modeling has gone too far, in that most
    top economic journals stress the model, thinking that improving the generality
    of a model, especially if it involves sufficient rigor (eg, theorems using set
    theory or value functions). But models are means to an end, and as there are no
    models in econ with the same reality as in physics, we should recognize their
    intermediate status.

    A lot of top theorists today have created models that have not generated really
    novel important results (eg, Mankiw, Cochrane, Campbell, Lucas, Romer, Krugman),
    instead, the models seem to offer hope that they will prove foundational, creating
    a method for introducing a theory that tersely explains, and offers the potential
    for refinements that create new important insights. That hope, alas, is not grounded
    in experience. Bellman equations, input-output matrices, second-order difference
    equations, set theory, are all areas of economic modeling that were once thought
    to provide essential methods for understanding economics, though they have been
    highly disappointing in what they have produced.

    of taste. I was told by one referee my model was too simple, and the fact these

    if people are better defined as envious, not greedy, there is a lot of benchmarking,
    and this leads to zero risk premiums, which is generally what we observe. That's
    a simple idea, which makes it a better idea than saying something less definitive
    but more ornate. But, that's why I'm not an academic.
