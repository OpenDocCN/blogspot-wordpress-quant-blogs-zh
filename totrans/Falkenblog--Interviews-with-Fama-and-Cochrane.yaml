    that nationwide housing prices will not fall, and has somehow turned into a clear
    call of an imminent market correction (and Shiller deserves some moral blame for
    not correcting this common statement because it distorts reality in his favor
    at the cost of rewriting the past).

    Think about an unemployed accountant in New Jersey, fired from a big bank. How
    is going to build a road in Montana going to help him? Keynes thought of a world
    in the nineteen-thirties where labor was more amorphous labor. If you hired people
    to dig ditches, that would solve the unemployment line in the car industry. We
    have very specialized labor, and just hiring people doesn’t resolve the problem.
    Somebody who lost their job in a bank—building more roads is not going to help
    them.
