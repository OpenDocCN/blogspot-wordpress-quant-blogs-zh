- en: I highlighted how the 5-week RSI of the S&P 500 became extremely overbought.
    In the past, such instances have resolved with a correction (check), a relief
    rally (check), followed by a re-test of the correction lows. In three of the last
    four cases, the second re-test held at the old lows. The only exception was the
    COVID Crash of 2020, which was panic driven by macro fundamentals. If history
    is any guide, the next corrective low should terminate at about the site of the
    August low, which is ~4350.
