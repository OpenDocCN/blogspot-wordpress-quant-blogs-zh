- en: Yesterday, I presented a chart of the [ratio of the VIX to the VXV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%3AVXV)
    and offered the interpretation that this indicator was suggesting little more
    than a mild overbought condition.

    a few pundits are pointing to the VIX and calling the market overbought.  Yesterday
    I barely stopped short of saying that the study of the percentage deviation of
    the VIX from the 10 day SMA is the “lazy man’s way to interpret the VIX,” but
    truth be told, that is about where I come down on the subject (with apologies
    to all the women who fall into the same trap.)

    easy to manage, but in doing so there is always the risk of oversimplification.

    the SPX is up 0.44%.  I’m sure that makes the 10%ers even more convinced that
    the market is about to pull back, but I am not prepared to accept that interpretation.  The
    VIX:VXV ratio continues to move sideways today and other volatility measures –
    which I vow to give more space to going forward – show more of a range-bound pattern
    than anything resembling the plummeting volatility that the 10%ers are undoubtedly
    seeing in the VIX.

- en: Recall that financials are the largest component of the SPX, which means they
    also have the heaviest weighting in the VIX (the same is true for the S&P 100
    index, a.k.a. the [OEX](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=.oexa), and its volatility
    counterpart, the [VXO](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXO).)  That
    being said, now that the Bear Stearns ([BSC](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=bsc))
    situation has been resolved, the Fed has expanded its role to enhance the liquidity
    of the investment banks, and Lehman Brothers ([LEH](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=leh))
    appears to be out of the woods after [experiencing strong demand](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=a014NhE6jEwU&refer=home)
    for its $4 billion convertible preferred offering, it should come as no surprise
    that volatility which is closely tied to the financial sector is showing the steepest
    drop. As an example, the most closely watched financial sector ETF, [XLF](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=xlf),
    has seen volatility drop 36% since the March 17^(th) high.  By the same token,
    falling volatility has taken the VIX and VXO down below their 200 day simple moving
    averages.  Move over to the [VXN](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXN)
    (the volatility index for the NASDAQ-100 or [NDX](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=.ndx)),
    however, and the picture is much less dramatic.  Instead of falling volatility,
    the chart shows range-bound volatility going back to August 2007 and current readings
    still comfortably above the 200 day SMA, albeit with a pattern of higher lows.  Given
    the relative weightings of the financial sector in the various volatility indices,
    from my perspective a strong break in the VXN below 25 would be a better broad-based
    sign of falling volatility than most of what we can discern from the VIX and the
    moment.
