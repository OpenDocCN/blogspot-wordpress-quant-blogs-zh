    levered beta players, e.g. a levered long-short in emerging markets does not give
    you much alpha, it's mostly an emerging market beta.

    are now in a crowded trade. The cost of entry to being a quant has fallen dramatically
    over the decades. Everyone went to the same schools and learned the same techniques
    and they all use the same databases. What's more, I can now create a relatively
    primitive quantitative equity research platform using free internet resources.

    Buffett''s success was that he wanted to own the whole company. While we all aspire
    to his track record, the Buffett approach also meant a significant degree of 1)
    tracking error risk; and 2) short and intermediate term drawdown risk. These kinds
    of risks make institutional investors and their managers uneasy, (dare I say "queasy"?)
    Maybe it''s time to return to those basics.'

    but goodie. Investors have it hammered in their heads that market timing doesn''t
    work and this approach can also be termed "uncomfortable" for investors. Managers
    who practice this art are practically extinct these days. In an era of macroeconomic
    uncertainty, however, these kinds of top-down macro techniques can yield a surprising
    level of alpha, according to research from [First Quadrant](http://www.firstquadrant.com/research.html).
    I am biased, of course, as my [Inflation-Deflation Timer model](http://www.qwestfunds.com/publications/newsletters_pdf/newsletter_november_2009.pdf)
    belongs in this class.'
