# Mobile Madness | Tales from a Trading Desk

## Mobile Madness

GQueues offers a view on iOS vs. Android [development](http://blog.gqueues.com/2013/07/android-vs-ios-comparing-development.html).  Hopefully GQueues will provide a further comparison against the [Blackberry 10](http://slashdot.org/topic/bi/blackberry-10-api-worth-your-development-time/) at some point in the future 🙂 – I’d be curious to see what [platform](http://developer.blackberry.com/devzone/develop/platform_choice/index.html) choice GQueues would take, Native or Java.  As an aside, Thomson Reuters Eikon [implies](http://bizblog.blackberry.com/2013/07/thomson-reuters-eikon-blackberry-10-app/) native, which based on the link in the article impies [C/C++](http://developer.blackberry.com/native/).  Which leads to the interesting view that for GQueues to support Blackberry 10, Android and iOS via native applications, they’d need to leverage 2 or 3 languages – Objective-C, Java and possibly C/C++.

Finally, its interesting to see that Google has attempted to ease some of the mobile pain by offering a [J2ObjC](https://code.google.com/p/j2objc/) translation tool.  Possibly the reason GQueues didn’t use the J2ObjC tool was because it hasn’t reached 1.0 yet.
