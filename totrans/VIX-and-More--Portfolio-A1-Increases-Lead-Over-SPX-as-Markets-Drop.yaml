- en: After the disastrous mid-August performance, it was heartening to see Portfolio
    A1 outperform the benchmark S&P 500 index during last week’s market turbulence.  While
    the margin of outperformance was small, this now means that the portfolio is up
    9.6% since the February 16, 2007 inception – a period in which the SPX is down
    0.1%.

- en: Some of the portfolio’s individual holdings did not fare particularly well during
    the week, with the result that the stock ranking system has elected to drop [DryShips
    (DRYS)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=drys) and [StatoilHydro (STO)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=sto).  These
    stocks are being replaced by China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., more commonly known
    as [Sinopec (SNP)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=snp), as well as [Perini
    (PCR)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=pcr), the large Boston-based construction
    company.  In spite of the very strong year it has had, I am not sure I would be
    chasing Perini at this point, but, this being a mechanical portfolio, all I can
    do is raise an eyebrow and be prepared to eat some crow.
