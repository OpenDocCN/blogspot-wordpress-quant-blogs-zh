    i.e. the usual formal requirement that macroeconomic models, to be considered
    legitimate, must be based on things like households and firms optimizing their
    intertemporal utility, having rational expectations, and so on. Apparently, things

    think) is against the authentic spirit of microfoundations, i.e. the idea that
    macroeconomic models ought to be based on plausible stories of how the real actors
    in an economy behave. If you get that right, then obviously your model might stand
    a chance of getting larger aggregate things right too. The problem we have today
    is that the microfoundations you find in DSGE models aren''t like this in the
    least. So macromodels are actually based on things we know to be wrong. It''s
    very strange indeed. As Noah puts it:'

    I just want to get rid of all the microfoundations. But that is precisely, exactly,
    180 degrees wrong! [I think microfoundations are a *great* idea](http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2012/03/why-bother-with-microfoundations.html)!
    I think they're the dog's bollocks! I think that macro time-series data is so
    uninformative that microfoundations are our only hope for really figuring out
    the macroeconomy. I think Robert Lucas was 100% on the right track when he called
    for us to use microfounded models.

    of microfoundations we use now (not all, but many) are just wrong. Obviously,
    clearly wrong. Lots of microeconomists I talk to agree with me about that. And
    lately I've been talking to some pretty prominent macroeconomists who agree as
    well.

    model) that -- when the agents in the model learn in a particular constrained
    way -- has two different equilibria. One is locally stable and the economy has
    inflation right around a targeted value. Start out with inflation and consumption
    and expectations close to that equilibrium and you'll move toward that point over
    time. The second equilibrium is, however, unstable. If you start out sufficiently
    far away from the stable equilibrium, you won't go there at all, but will wander
    down into a deflationary zone (and what happens then I don't know).

- en: This model for aggregate behaviour is based on some fairly simple low-dimensional
    equations for how current consumption and inflation feed, via expectations, into
    future values and a trajectory for the economy. I don't know how plausible these
    equations are. I'm guessing that someone can make a good argument about why they
    should have the form they do (or a similar form). That story would involve references
    to how things happening now in the economy would influence peoples' behaviour
    and their expectations, and then how these would cause certain kinds of changes.
    To really believe this you'd want to see some evidence that this story is correct,
    i.e. that people, firms, etc., really do tend to behave like this.

- en: The point I want to make is that -- for someone like myself who has not been
    socialized to accept the necessity of what currently counts as "microfoundations"
    -- nothing about the story becomes more plausible when I wade into the equations
    of the New Keynesian model and see how households and firms independently optimize
    their intertemporal utilities subject to certain budget constraints. If anything,
    seeing all this dubious stuff makes me less likely to believe in the plausibility
    of the low dimensional equations for aggregate variables. And this is precisely
    the problem with microfoundations of this kind. They don't give a good argument
    for why the aggregate variables should satisfy these equations. They give a very
    bad. An unconvincing argument. At least for me.
