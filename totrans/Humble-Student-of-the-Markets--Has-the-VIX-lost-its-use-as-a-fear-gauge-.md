# Humble Student of the Markets: Has the VIX lost its use as a fear gauge?

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2023/09/has-vix-lost-its-use-as-fear-gauge.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2023/09/has-vix-lost-its-use-as-fear-gauge.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models** 

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post, 

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The 

**Trend Asset Allocation Model**

 is an asset allocation model that applies trend-following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity prices. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. The performance and full details of a model portfolio based on the out-of-sample signals of the Trend Model can be found

[here](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/trend-model-report-card/)

.

My inner trader uses a 

**trading model**

, which is a blend of price momentum (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa). Subscribers receive real-time alerts of model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of the email alerts is updated weekly

. The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that began in March 2016 is shown below.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Buy equities (Last changed from “sell” on 28-Jul-2023)*
*   Trend Model signal: Bullish (Last changed from “neutral” on 28-Jul-2023)*
*   Trading model: Neutral (Last changed from “bearish” on 03-Aug-2023)*

#### VIX as fear gauge

There have been a series of recent articles highlighting the subdued level of the VIX Index and the seasonal tendency for equity volatility to spike this time of year (see this

[Barron’s article](https://www.barrons.com/articles/stock-market-volatility-what-to-do-bfe3fd90)

as an example). Other analysts have speculated that the VIX Index is failing as a fear gauge.

I have few opinions on the seasonality of the VIX, though last week has historically been a weak one for S&P 500 returns. However, I beg to differ on the use of the VIX as a fear gauge.

That’s because the VIX Index was not designed to be a fear indicator. It was designed to measure the implied volatility of a series of at-the-money options with a 1-month time horizon. While some analysts have seized upon implied volatility for use as a fear gauge, the index was never intended for use that way.
Indeed, the current explosion in 0DTE trading, or options that expire the same day, makes a 1-month implied volatility have less utility as a sentiment indicator. Arguably, VXST, or the 9-day VIX, is more useful to measure short-term sentiment. The accompanying chart shows that VXST was faster to spike in the current instance than VIX. The term structure of the VIX-VXST curve shows an inversion, which is an indication of fear appearing in the market.

The key question for investors is whether fear levels are high enough for a short-term bottom.
