- en: In the past few weeks I have had a number of discussions with investors. Virtually
    everyone knows that there is a banking crisis brewing in Europe but some have
    only a vague understanding of the mechanics of the crisis of its resolution. For
    the benefit of everyone, here is a primer on banking.

- en: Here is an idealized model of a bank. Bank ABC takes in $100 in deposits (so
    it owes the depositors $100). To make money, it lends out its deposits. To be
    prudent (because loans can go sour), it lends out $93\. It has $5 in common equity
    and an additional $3 in preferred share equity and bonds.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Supposing that Bank ABC makes 1% on the spread between its deposits and loans.
    Since the ratio of deposits to common equity is 20 to 1 ($100 to $5), that equates
    to a 20% return, before paying expenses, such as salaries, rent, etc.

    that Bank ABC is unstable. Depositors rush to the bank and withdraw their money.
    What happens then?

- en: The bank has an obligation to give the depositors their money (it is their money,
    after all). The bank has a health porfolio of loans. That's called a liquidity
    crisis.

    other banks, or to the central bank as a lender of last resort. It may be required

    out have largely gone sour. The loan portfolio is now worth $90 (and $3 in loan
    losses).

    $2\. If there are further loan losses, then shareholders get hit further, then
    the preferred shareholders are next, followed by bondholders.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Supposing that Bank ABC were to get hit with $10 in loan losses instead of $3\.
    They now have negative equity. This is called insolvency - and no amount of liquidity
    injection from the central bank can save Bank ABC.

    and becomes insolvent. Under the Swedish solution, the government comes in and
    injects new equity to make the depositors whole. The shareholders get wiped out.
    The preferred shareholders and bondholders either take haircuts or get wiped out.

    solution. In effect, the authorities said, "I know that these loans are not worth
    face value, but we'll pretend that that they are and we'll make you whole on the
    loans." In effect, they bought those loans for roughly face value on the fear
    that if they didn't, the entire banking system would go down.

    cost of the Swedish solution compared to the TARP solution. If you were to spend
    $1 to recapitalize a bank that is levered 20 to 1 under the Swedish solution,
    you would have to spend $20 (20 to 1 leverage) under the TARP solution.
