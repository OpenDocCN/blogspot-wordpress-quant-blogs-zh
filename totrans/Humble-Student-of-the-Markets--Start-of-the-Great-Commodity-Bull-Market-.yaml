    on the basis of risk-weighted assets, unlike the US where it is the total leverage
    ratio that matters, so most European banks bought assets that were rated by Moody’s
    and S&P, who couldn’t rate their way out of a paper bag, and for anything that
    wasn’t highly rated, they bought credit default swaps or guarantees from AIG and
    MBIA. Because of that European banks were able to lever up a lot more than their
    US counterparties. Given the much higher leverage levels and general worsening
    of collateral values, we think that all the shoes in Europe have not dropped.”'

    Europe, which is in a very serious recession, and so many of those loans are simply
