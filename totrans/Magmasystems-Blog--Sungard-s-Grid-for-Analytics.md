# Magmasystems Blog: Sungard's Grid for Analytics

> 来源：[http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2006/10/sungards-grid-for-analytics.html#0001-01-01](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2006/10/sungards-grid-for-analytics.html#0001-01-01)

It was brought to my attention today that Sungard has Adaptiv Analytics, a

[calculation framework](http://www.sungard.com/adaptiv/solutions/adaptivanalytics.htm)

that is grid enabled. The marketing literature says that it has pricing and risk simulations right out of the box.

What might be attractive about this is :

1) Sungard has a long history of dealing with financial companies

2) The product seems to be tuned for a specific vertical industry and a specific purpose .... to speed up pricing and risk.

3) They claim to be based totally on .NET !!!!!!!!!!

Anybody using this thing yet? Wonder what the other grid vendors have to say about this?
