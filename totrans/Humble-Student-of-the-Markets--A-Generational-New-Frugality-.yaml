    the nonconsumer. Japanese in their late teens and early 20s, it said, did not
    have cars. They didn’t drink alcohol. They didn’t spend Christmas Eve with their
    boyfriends or girlfriends at fancy hotels downtown the way earlier generations
    did. I have taught many students who fit this mold. They work hard at part-time
    jobs, spend hours at McDonald’s sipping cheap coffee, eat fast food lunches at
    Yoshinoya. They save their money for the future.'

    Japan as a flourishing economy. They are accustomed to being frugal. Today’s youths,
    living in a society older than any in the world, are the first since the late
    19th century to feel so uneasy about the future.

    show that they don’t travel the way we used to. Perhaps it’s a reaction against
    their globalizing elders who are still zealously pushing English-language education
    and overseas employment. Young people have grown less interested in studying foreign
    languages. They seem not to feel the urge to grow outward. Look, they say, Japan
    is a small country. And we’re O.K. with small.

- en: While building a nest egg for emergencies is important to Canadians of all ages,
    the necessity of saving for a rainy day is most keenly felt by the younger generation
    (18-34) and they are just as likely to have a plan in place to achieve their savings
    goals as those in older age brackets, according to a recent Scotiabank study conducted
    by Harris/Decima to assess the saving patterns of Canadians.

    in financing their major purchases, with 38 per cent indicating they would prefer
    to save up and then pay for the whole thing compared to 28 per cent of those aged
    35-44 and 27 per cent in the 45-54 and 55+ age groups.
