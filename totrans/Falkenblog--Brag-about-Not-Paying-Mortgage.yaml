    (120 plus overtime, whatever that is), couldn't pay his $4,700 per month mortgage.

    in his house, waiting for the bank to kick him out. He does not mention it, but
    I imagine if the banks try to kick him out he will fight it, even though he is
    basically living there without paying anyone. He truly has no shame, as this is
    the center point of his New York Times Magazine article and his book.

    a worse neighborhood he has chosen to stay in his current house without paying.
    He does not value the bourgeois virtue of paying one's debts. Legally, he can
    default on his mortgage, but extra-legally, he is a shmendrik (aka, loser).

    that he could rationalize this kind of unethical behavior highlights a big problem
    we all face. If the zeitgeist says that those who don't pay their mortgage, for
    whatever reason, are victims of big, greedy banks, then we have a big problem.
    It has always been proposed that a jubilee, or absolving debtors of their obligations,
    would fix problems, but doing this just raises the costs of debt for future borrowers,
    most of whom had nothing to do with the prior situation. You can't break promises
    without considering their effect on future transactions.
