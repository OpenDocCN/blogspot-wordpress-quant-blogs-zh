    (120 plus overtime, whatever that is), couldn't pay his $4,700 per month mortgage.

    in his house, waiting for the bank to kick him out. He does not mention it, but
    I imagine if the banks try to kick him out he will fight it, even though he is
    basically living there without paying anyone. He truly has no shame, as this is
    the center point of his New York Times Magazine article and his book.

  zh: 关于他的情况。他8个月前停止支付抵押贷款，现在只是坐在房子里，等待银行把他赶出去。他没有提到，但我想如果银行试图把他赶出去，他会反抗，尽管他基本上是在那里住着而没有给任何人付钱。他真的没有羞耻心，因为这是他《纽约时报》杂志文章和他的书的中心观点。
- en: He can't afford his mortgage, but instead of moving into a smaller place in
    a worse neighborhood he has chosen to stay in his current house without paying.
    He does not value the bourgeois virtue of paying one's debts. Legally, he can
    default on his mortgage, but extra-legally, he is a shmendrik (aka, loser).

  zh: 他支付不起抵押贷款，但他选择留在目前的房子里不付款，而不是搬到更糟糕的社区里的更小的地方。他不重视偿还债务的资产阶级美德。从法律上讲，他可以拖欠抵押贷款，但从额外的法律上讲，他是一个“懦夫”（也就是说，失败者）。
- en: I think he is a thoughtful person, probably a good neighbor and friend. But
    that he could rationalize this kind of unethical behavior highlights a big problem
    we all face. If the zeitgeist says that those who don't pay their mortgage, for
    whatever reason, are victims of big, greedy banks, then we have a big problem.
    It has always been proposed that a jubilee, or absolving debtors of their obligations,
    would fix problems, but doing this just raises the costs of debt for future borrowers,
    most of whom had nothing to do with the prior situation. You can't break promises
    without considering their effect on future transactions.

  zh: 我认为他是一个深思熟虑的人，可能是一个好邻居和朋友。但他能为这种不道德行为辩解，突显出我们所有人面临的一个大问题。如果时代精神认为那些不支付抵押贷款的人，无论出于何种原因，都是大、贪婪的银行的受害者，那么我们就有一个大问题。人们一直提议进行赦免，或者免除债务人的义务，以解决问题，但这样做只会提高未来借款人的债务成本，其中大多数人与之前的情况无关。你不能不考虑未来交易的影响就打破承诺。
