- en: One thing traders need to keep in mind in the current environment is that when
    the market is bouncing off of intermediate-term lows it is more likely to get
    overbought and STAY overbought than when it’s simply consolidating in a downtrend.
    Shorting bounces off lows typically carries an extra level of risk because of
    this.

    SPY closed higher 3 days in a row. Tuesday was the narrowest range in the last
    5 days. When trading under the 200-day moving average, this combination can signal
    the market is likely to pull back. See the test below:'

    out for example there are only 18% winners.

    a bit of a bullish one. Now 2 days out there are 82% winners. (Although instances
    are low and that’s not really the point.) The point is that it is much more dangerous
    to short a market coming off of fresh lows. This is especially true when the lows
    occurred on extremely oversold conditions.

- en: While previous attempted rallies did quickly roll over the last 2 months, that’s
    not always the case. Examples of oversold bounces off lows that would have been
    especially dangerous to short include August 2007, October 2002 and September
    2001.
