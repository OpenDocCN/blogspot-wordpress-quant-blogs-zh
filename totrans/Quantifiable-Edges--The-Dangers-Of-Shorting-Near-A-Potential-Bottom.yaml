- en: One thing traders need to keep in mind in the current environment is that when
    the market is bouncing off of intermediate-term lows it is more likely to get
    overbought and STAY overbought than when it’s simply consolidating in a downtrend.
    Shorting bounces off lows typically carries an extra level of risk because of
    this.

    SPY closed higher 3 days in a row. Tuesday was the narrowest range in the last
    5 days. When trading under the 200-day moving average, this combination can signal
    the market is likely to pull back. See the test below:'

- en: There is no longer a bearish edge to the setup. In fact, there appears to be
    a bit of a bullish one. Now 2 days out there are 82% winners. (Although instances
    are low and that’s not really the point.) The point is that it is much more dangerous
    to short a market coming off of fresh lows. This is especially true when the lows
    occurred on extremely oversold conditions.

    not always the case. Examples of oversold bounces off lows that would have been
    especially dangerous to short include August 2007, October 2002 and September
    2001.
