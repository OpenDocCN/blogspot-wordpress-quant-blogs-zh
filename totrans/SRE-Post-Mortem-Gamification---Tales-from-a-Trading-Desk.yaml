- en: I really like gamification.  In some firms its in almost part of the culture. 
    Of particular interest around post mortem’s is Google’s gamification [leaderboard](https://landing.google.com/sre/workbook/chapters/postmortem-culture/#postmortem-leaderboard).

    toward a larger goal, such as fixing system weaknesses and increasing reliability.
    For these individuals, a scoreboard or burndown of postmortem action items can
    be an incentive. At Google, we hold “FixIt” weeks twice a year. SREs who close
    the most postmortem action items receive small tokens of appreciation and (of
    course) bragging rights
