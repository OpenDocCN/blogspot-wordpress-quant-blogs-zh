    to give readers a few links here to various key papers of John Geanakoplos on
    the leverage cycle, as well as a little further discussion of a few points.

- en: the most detailed paper Geanakoplos has published (as far as I know) describing
    the leverage cycle -- the natural feedback process that repeatedly drives economies
    through cycles in which leverage rises, driving increasing asset prices, and then
    falls as investors become uncertain, more cautious, and demand more collateral,
    Prices then crash down accordingly. His argument is that leverage (determined
    by collateral rates) is a key macroeconomic variable completely independent from
    interest rates, and often just as important to the economy at large. In particular,
    increasing (decreasing) leverage is one key direct cause of increasing (or decreasing)
    prices. As evidence, look at the figure below for housing prices from 2000 through
    2009\. It shows how the average down payment required for sub-prime mortgages
    went up and then down, in both cases just in advance of housing prices. (Okay,

- en: First, given the clear importance of leverage in driving economic outcomes,
    it is quite remarkable that the Federal Reserve Bank has not in the past made
    any systematic effort to collect the kind of data it would need to monitor average
    collateral rates in the economy. Between 2000 and 2005, for example, no one at
    the Fed was going to banks and collecting information on how much collateral they
    were demanding when lending. This was just not considered a crucial macroeconomic
    variable. Judging from the tone in his talk, Geanakoplos finds this pretty amazing
    too. He mentions that the Fed contacted him in 2008 or so to get hold of data
    of this kind that he had collected. It seems that the Fed has now accepted the
    systemic importance of leverage and is seriously considering including leverage
    as a key variable in future macroeconomic monitoring. Whether banks and hedge
    funds will be required to report leverage levels, I don't know, but this idea
    is at least on the table. Good thing, I think.

- en: A second interesting point is one that seems kind of obvious in retrospect.
    The leverage that drives the rise of prices in Geanakoplos's picture is leverage
    in long positions, which enables optimistic investors to buy more than they would
    otherwise be able to buy. Leverage in the opposing sense, short leverage allowing
    pessimists to speculate on a collapse in the market, would act to depress prices.
    Hence, it is probably more than a little significant that credit default swaps
    (CDS) for mortgage backed securities were created in 2005\. These most likely
    acted as a key trigger of the beginning of the crash. As Geanakoplos writes,

- en: In my view, an important trigger for the collapse of 2007–9 was the introduction
    of CDS contracts into the mortgage market in late 2005, at the height of the market.
    Credit default swaps on corporate bonds had been traded for years, but until 2005
    there had been no standardized mortgage CDS contract. I do not know the impetus
    for this standardization; perhaps more people wanted to short the market once
    it got so high. But the implication was that afterward the pessimists, as well
    as the optimists, had an opportunity to leverage. This was bound to depress mortgage
    security prices. ... this, in turn, forced underwriters of mortgage securities
    to require mortgage loans with higher collateral so they would be more attractive,
    which, in turn, made it impossible for homeowners to refinance their mortgages,
    forcing many to default, which then began to depress home prices, which then made
    it even harder to sell new mortgages, and so on. I believe the introduction of
    CDS trading on a grand scale in mortgages is a critical, overlooked factor in
    the crisis. Until now people have assumed it all began when home prices started
    to fall in 2006\. But why home prices should begin to fall then has remained a
    mystery.

    but they probably hastened the collapse.

    a simple explanation of "how the economy works" and he puts the expansion and
    contraction of credit at the very center. He is essentially making much the same
    argument as Geanakoplos, but in a less formal way. Fun to read and very instructive,
    in my opinion.
