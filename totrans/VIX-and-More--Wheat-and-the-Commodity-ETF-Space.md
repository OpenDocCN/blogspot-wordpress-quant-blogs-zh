# VIX and More: Wheat and the Commodity ETF Space

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/08/wheat-and-commodity-etf-space.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/08/wheat-and-commodity-etf-space.html#0001-01-01)

Anyone with even a passing interest in [commodities](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/commodities) has no doubt taken notice that the [worst drought in Russia in at least 50 years](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-08-04/wheat-exports-from-russia-ukraine-are-draining-out-flour-miller-says.html), coupled with climatological excesses around the globe which have created a substantial disruption in the supply of agricultural commodities, most notably in wheat.

The graphic below from [ETFreplay.com](http://etfreplay.com/) summarizes some of the impact on selected commodity ETFs and ETNs over the course of the past week. Note that [JJG](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/JJG), the iPath Dow Jones-UBS Grains Total Return Sub-Index ETN, is up 9% in the past week and broader commodity and agricultural ETFs such as [RJA](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/RJA) and [DBC](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/DBC) have also been lifted significantly by the surge in agricultural futures prices.

In addition to JJG, investors looking for a grain-specific ETF/ETN may also wish to check out [GRU](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/GRU), the ELEMENTS MLCX Grains Index Total Return ETN. As noted [last Friday](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/07/lsc-long-short-commodities-etf.html), investors can also take a long position in grains by shorting the ELEMENTS S&P Commodity Trends Indicator ETN ([LSC](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/LSC)), where 36.8% of the ETN is currently short grains.
