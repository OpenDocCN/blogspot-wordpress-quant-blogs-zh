- en: The Trend Model is an asset allocation model which applies trend following principles
    based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. In essence, it seeks
    to answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish)
    or contraction (bearish)?"

    answer the question, "Is the trend getting better (bullish) or worse (bearish)?"
    The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of the trading model

    alarm after another, which made them increasingly annoyed. When the wolf finally
    came, his warnings were ignored and he suffered the consequence.

- en: I want to tell a more modern story of the boy who cried wolf. In this case,
    the wolf is inflation. In the wake of the Great Financial Crisis (GFC), there
    was a cacophony of voices (myself included) who warned that all the QE and money
    printing would eventually result in runaway inflation and USD devaluation. Even
    Warren Buffett was caught up in that frenzy when he penned his "unchecked greenback
    emission"

    ratio and keep our growth in obligations in line with our growth in resources.

    emissions will certainly cause the purchasing power of currency to melt. The dollar’s
    destiny lies with Congress.

    GFC and gold prices are roughly flat from that period. That thesis of secular
    runaway inflation turned out to be wrong.

    of the specter of secular runaway inflation, the cyclical inflationary wolves
    are gathering. When they descend on the flock in 2016, it will be the macro surprise
    that almost no one is talking about.
