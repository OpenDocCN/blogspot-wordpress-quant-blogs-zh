    effect" by encouraging speculation in risk assets - to be dangerously misguided.
    Historically, the elasticity of GDP to changes in the stock market is on the order
    of 0.03 to 0.05, and is transitory at that. In plain English, this means that
    even large changes in the value of the stock market do not translate well into
    changes in GDP. This is because consumers correctly consume on the basis of what
    they see as their "permanent income," and are well aware that changes in volatile
    assets tend to be transitory when they are not accompanied by growth in real output
    and incomes. ***Bernanke is not thinking as an economist in this regard. He is
    thinking like a witch doctor calling on animal spirits (ooh, eee, ooh-aah-aah,
    ting, tang, walla-walla bing-bang).***

    provided early indications that the ECB would be stepping up its buying peripheral
    government debt issued by Ireland, Greece, Portugal and Spain. Of course, the
    ECB prefers to "sterilize" these interventions, so it can be expected to sell
    the debt of stronger members such as Germany. Accordingly, yields dropped on the
    debt of credit-strained European countries, while German yields pushed to fresh
    yearly highs.

    actions of the ECB are ultimately likely to represent not monetary policy but
    fiscal policy. When you buy the debt of countries that have a high likelihood
    of defaulting on this debt, or will avoid default only by the creation of currency
    that could have been issued to finance fiscal expenditures, it follows that you
    are engaging in fiscal policy without the authorization of elected governments.

- en: I believe that as long as the RMB-USD peg remains, Federal Reserve actions (QE2,
    QE3...) are likely to export asset price inflation to China and the Chinese authorities
    have limited tools available to combat domestic inflationary pressures. The real
    risk becomes one of China going overboard on the limited toolset that they have
    and send their economy into a hard landing.

    only corrective action (for now). Should the Shanghai Composite weaken further,
    along with other indicators such as the Baltic Dry and more signs of Chinese tightening,
    then it's time for the bulls to head for the exits.
