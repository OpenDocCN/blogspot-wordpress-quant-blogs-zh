    Even with Visual Studio 2005 new [refactoring](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnvs05/html/VS05_refac.asp)
    support, to be truely productive you still need [ReSharper](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/).
    If Microsoft still can’t understand the concept of refactoring in 2006, then maybe
    its time for them to give in, accept they will never build a decent IDE, and buy
    JetBrains to resolve the issue.

    I understand the need for Microsoft to charge more for the [Team System](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/teamsystem/products/compare/default.aspx)
    versions compared to Professional, but why did they have to only add [integrated](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/products/compare/)
    support for FxCop, Unit Testing and Code Profiling into Team System? Surely these
    are features every developer should use as standard – yet another reason why Microsoft
    to buy JetBrains.
