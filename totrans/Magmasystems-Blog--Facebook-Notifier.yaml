- en: 'Last night, with the rain pouring outside and the US Open tennis matches postponed,
    I decided to write something that I''ve wanted for a long time. An application
    that sits in the Windows System Tray and notifies me when I get a new Facebook
    notification. By "notification", I am referring to the red balloon with the number
    ''4'':'

- en: . Using this toolkit, it only took me about two hours from start to finish to
    complete my notifier. I spent another hour cleaning up the code and parameterizing
    some of the hard-coded things like my user ID, my application's secret codes,
    and the stuff around the playing of the notification sound.

- en: I found that I had to resort to FQL (which is the SQL-like query facility that
    Facebook provides) to properly retrieve the state of my Facebook notifications.
    The function that the Facebook Toolkit gave me always told me that I had no notifications.

- en: This application is just for me, and I do not think that I will be releasing
    it. If I really wanted to do something serious, I would create a general-purpose
    notifier toolkit that is able to work over Facebook, GMail, Yahoo Mail, etc. Each
    of these services would have its own "input adapter" as part of the notification
    framework. And, I would probably integrate this with some sort of CEP engine so
    that alerts could be sent to a Facebook account.
