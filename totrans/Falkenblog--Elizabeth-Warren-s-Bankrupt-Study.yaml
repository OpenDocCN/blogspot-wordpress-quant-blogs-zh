    their fault. They asked a select group of 2314 bankrupt people motivated to respond
    to their 5251 randomly selected debtors. These responders had ''the same'' assets
    and liabilities as non-responders, implying to the authors no selection bias,
    ignoring the different propensity of such responders to confabulate tendentiously.
    They looked for the following, all of which count as ''causing'' their bankruptcy:'

    but rather admitting one is currently poor. I can't believe a study adressing
    some personal failure is done in this way. I presume most criminality is due to
    police brutality and biased judges and prosecutors under this approach.

    and America spends 15% of its GDP on healthcare, I'm surprised it is not 100%
    caused by healthcare. Of course using this definition, it is also probably 100%
    caused by food. And housing, another 100% cause. What major sector of expenditures
    doesn't cause bankruptcy?
