    theme and show how the [Principal Component Analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis)
    can be used to build portfolios that are not correlated to the market. Most of
    the content for this post is based on the excellent article, [“Using PCA for spread
    trading”](http://matlab-trading.blogspot.ca/2012/12/using-pca-for-spread-trading.html)
    by Jev Kuznetsov.

    market and all principal components have very low correlation to each other and
    very low correlation to the market. Also by construction the volatility of principal
    components is decreasing. An interesting observation that you might want to check
    yourself: principal components are quite persistent in time (i.e. if you compute
    both correlations and volatilities using the future prices, for example, 4 years
    of prices, the principal components maintain their correlation and volatility
    profiles)'

    use Augmented Dickey-Fuller test to check if principal components are mean-reverting.
    (small p-value => stationary i.e. mean-reverting)

    market. There are many ways you can use this infromation. Please share your ideas
    and suggestions.
