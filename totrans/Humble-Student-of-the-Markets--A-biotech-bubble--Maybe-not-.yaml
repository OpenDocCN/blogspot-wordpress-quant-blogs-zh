    at the biotech ETF (IBB) shows that this group (bottom panel) has been steadily
    advancing since the stock market bottomed in 2009\. It decisively broke out to
    new all-time highs in late 2010\. By contrast, the SPX (top panel) didn't exceed
    its old highs until three years later in 2013.

    frenzy subsides, biotech firms will continue to prosper. First, many smaller firms
    have become the research engines for bigger ones, explains Kevin Starr of Third
    Rock, a venture-capital firm.

    an American biotech company, to help drive its growth. This year alone, Sanofi
    will pump about $1 billion into Regeneron’s research programme. The goal is not
    to "Sanofise" Regeneron or any other partner, says Christopher Viehbacher, Sanofi’s
    chief executive. Rather, it is to combine Regeneron’s capabilities in researching
    new treatments with Sanofi’s skill in bringing them to market.

    of research. It helps finance the scientific work at smaller companies, then usually
    takes over a drug’s development as it moves into clinical trials. Besides being
    costly, these require expertise that younger, smaller firms often lack.

    thanks to a better understanding of the faulty gene that causes it. Bluebird bio,
    one of Celgene’s small partner firms, which Third Rock also financed, is working
    on a treatment for sickle-cell disease that inserts into the patient’s blood cells
    a properly functioning version of the faulty gene that causes the inherited ailment.

    is now easier to identify which patients have the specific genetic trait that
    a new drug is aimed at. This makes it more worthwhile to research diseases that
    are rare, and those that have so far proved intractable. The FDA gives special
    consideration to drugs that treat such ailments, so companies can expect a speedier
    path to approval.

    moonshot winner - the next darling group that the momentum crowd embraces and
    outperformance could go on for much longer than anyone imagines. We may need comments
    like "valuations don't matter" and the emergence some truly *ahem* creative valuation
    techniques, such as the price to eyeballs metric of the internet era, before the
    bubble pops.

    were overly ambitious.
