    unusual action. On Thursday night he noted the CBOE Equity Put/Call Ratio had
    come in extremely low. I decided to do a study on performance following extremely
    low 1-day readings.

    P/C Ratio today came in at 0.55, which is a little over 25% below the 200ma of
    0.74\. I then looked at all other times the Equity P/C came in more than 25% below
    its 200ma.

    from such readings, they only last 1 day. Now let’s take a deeper look at those
    48 trades and see what the results looked like over time. (Chart from Tradestation.)

    From November 2007 – present though there has been a strong bearish tendency.
    Seeing this graph would make many people wonder whether the negative performance
    is primarily just a byproduct of a horrible bear market.

    P/C Ratio have been followed by strongly negative action. This leads me to conclude
    that the CBOE Equity P/C Ratio may provide a short-term edge and its suggesting
    downside for Friday’s trading. I’d recommend checking out
