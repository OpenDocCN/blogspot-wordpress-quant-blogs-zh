    the requirements – both functional and non-functional.  In many ways, the word “requirements”
    draws on the legacy of a waterfall approach that generated large wades of documentation,
    with little though to the needs of the development team – no need to go on down
    this road.  Personally, I prefer the word “application behaviour” for obvious
    reasons – [BDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development).

    is therefore an interesting book in many ways, since you’d expect an agile requirement
    book to be re-iterating well documented concepts around story writing, backlogs
    and acceptance criteria/tests, coupled with development practices to validate
    the application has delivered on the required behaviour.  My expectation of the
    value of the book was there not high at the outset because there are already many
    good books out there that deal with stories etc.  I’m also conscious that Dean
    Leffingwell worked at Rational Software, were [RUP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_Unified_Process)
    was conceived, and therefore expected a SAFe push from the book, even though the
    title doesn’t state [SAFe](http://www.scaledagileframework.com/).  SAFe maybe
    fine if you are running a 300+ person project, but for many companies this isn’t
    going to be the case.'

- en: Chapter 12 – Requirements Discovery Toolkit.  This chapter offers some direction
    around running workshops, interviews and questionnaires.  There’s also the usual
    mention of User Experience (UX) mock-ups that we should all be familiar with these
    days.  Competitive analysis is also touch on – something few banks often do, but
    one in particular that I was involved with, did well, and benefited from the direction
    they took their electronic trading product.

    (e.g. activity diagrams) which I would hope most would be aware of.

- en: Appendix D – Backlog Meta-Model.  Possibly the most useful page in the book,
    unless you’ve built your own already.  Interestingly, its [available](http://scalingsoftwareagilityblog.com/updated-agile-requirements-metamodel-enterprise-backlog-model/)
    [online](http://scaledagileframework.com/agile-software-requirements-model/) (and
    thus possibly removing the need for any agile minded individual to buy the book).

    requirements, or hasn’t embraced user story mapping, backlogs, BDD and other agile
    techniques.  Finally, if you are on the SAFe road, its probably a must read.
