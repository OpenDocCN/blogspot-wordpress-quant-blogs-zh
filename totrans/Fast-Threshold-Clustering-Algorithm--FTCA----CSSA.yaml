    recipe. During  the summer of 2011, I worked with [Corey Rittenhouse](http://catallacticanalysis.com/)
    to develop algorithms for grouping asset classes. At the time, I did not have
    any familiarity with “clustering” algorithms that are often used in  data mining
    research. The first algorithm that was created resulted from a desire to simplify
    the complex problem of grouping assets with very few steps, and also to make it
    computationally simple. As it turns out, ignorance was bliss. The **Fast Threshold
    Clustering Algorithm** **(FTCA)** has many desirable properties that traditional
    clustering algorithms do not: 1) it produces fairly stable clusters 2) it is fast
    and deterministic 3) it is easy to understand.  When [Michael Kapler](http://systematicinvestor.wordpress.com/)
    and I conducted cluster research for our [Cluster Risk Parity](http://www.systematicportfolio.com/rfinance2013) portfolio
    allocation approach with modern clustering methods, one of the biggest issues
    we both saw was that the resulting clusters changed too frequently– creating excessive
    turnover. Furthermore, highly correlated datasets such as the Dow 30, had more
    clusters than logic or rationale would tend to dictate. This  results from the
    fact that most cluster algorithms function like an optimization routine that seeks
    to maximize inter-cluster dissimilarity and intra-cluster similarity. This can
    mean that clusters will change because of very small changes in the correlation
    matrix that are more likely to be a function of noise. Threshold clustering by
    comparison uses a logical correlation threshold to proxy “similar” versus “dissimilar.”
    In FTCA, I initially used a correlation threshold of .5 (approximately the level
    of statistical significance) to separate similar from dissimilar assets.  The
    FTCA works similar to the [Minimum Correlation Algorithm](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2012/09/21/minimum-correlation-algorithm-paper-release/
    "Minimum Correlation Algorithm Paper Release") in that it uses the average correlation
    of each asset to all other assets as a means of determining how closely or distantly
    related an asset is to the universe of assets chosen. A graphic of how the FTCA
    creates clusters is presented below:'

    of .5 on previously used datasets such as the 8 major liquid ETFs (GLD,TLT,SPY,IWM,QQQ,EFA,EEM,IYR),
    and the 9 sector Spyders (S&P500 sectors: XLP,XLV,XLU,XLK,XLI,XLE,XLB,XLY,XLF).
    The database was updated until May of 2013 and shows the historical allocations/last
    12 months of clusters generated using a 252-day lookback for correlation with
    monthly rebalancing. First the 8 major liquid ETFs:'

    12 month period. The clusters essentially represent Gold, Bonds and Equities (note
    that a 60 month period shows very little change as well). Now lets take a look
    at the clusters generated on the famously noisy S&P500 sectors:'

    membership. Most of the time, the sectors are intuitively considered to be one
    cluster, while occasionally the utilities sector shows a lack of correlation to
    the rest of the group. The choice of threshold will change the number and stability
    of the clusters- with higher thresholds showing more clusters and a greater change
    in membership than lower thresholds. As much as I have learned about very sophisticated
    clustering methods in the last year, I often am drawn back to the simplicity and
    practicality of FTCA.  From a portfolio management standpoint, it makes using
    clusters far more practical as well for tactical asset allocation or implementing
    cluster risk parity.
