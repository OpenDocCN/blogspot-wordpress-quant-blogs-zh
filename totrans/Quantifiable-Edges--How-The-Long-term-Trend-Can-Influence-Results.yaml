    is hitting new highs here. QQQQ triggered a study that was shown on the blog a
    little over a year ago

    while the market is in a short-term uptrend.

    often helpful to put studies into their longer-term context. The last couple of
    days QQQQ has closed above its 200-day moving. Below I broke down the results
    of the original test into those times it triggered below and above its 200-day
    moving average.

    QQQQ is the first major index to cross its 200-day moving average. Should the
    rally continue and the other major indices follow it will be important for traders
    to keep the long-term trend in mind when considering trades.
