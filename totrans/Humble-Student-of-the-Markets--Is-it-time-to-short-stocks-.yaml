    came alive with buzz about the technical damage done to the major US equity averages.
    My inner investor is getting more cautious, though my inner trader thinks it may
    be premature to get aggressively short the stock market.

    zone and remained above the 50 days moving average (dma). The 5-day RSI (bottom
    panel), which is useful for short-term swing trading, showed fading momentum.
    Bulls could be comforted by monitoring how the index would behave in the support
    zone pictured in the chart below.

    consisted of momentum technology names such as Amazon.com, Google, Facebook, etc.
    The chart of their relative performance to the SPX showed a violation of the relative
    uptrend line, with little support beneath current levels. There is a glimmer of
    hope as the decline could be arrested at one of the pictured Fibonacci retracement
    levels.

    below shows that COMPQ had breached its 50 dma and it was testing the the bottom

    SPX is more troubling as it shows that these high-beta stocks had violated a relative
    uptrend line, which is indicative of declining risk appetite.

    prices are capable of making a new high in April or May. Bears should consider
    that high-beta assets are highly oversold and could stage / a counter-trend rally
    at any time. As well,.the market have experienced numerous breaks of uptrends
    or relative uptrends. However, trend breaks tend to resolve themselves in a period
    of sideways consolidation, rather than an immediate trend reversal. Consider this
    classic example of the relative performance of the NASDAQ 100 against the SPX
    in the last 15 years. NDX underwent both a relative uptrend and relative downtrend
    and, in both cases, the relative breakout and breakdown were followed periods
    of consolidation.

    The Citigroup US Economic Surprise Index is near the bottom of its near term range
    and has started turn up. Such a reversal could translate into better company guidance
    as we move through Earnings Season, which would be bullish for stocks. The first
    key test for bulls and bears alike will be the jobs report on Friday. Anyone putting
    on a major bearish position here would be betting that the Economic Surprise Index
    continues to deteriorate and growth starts to decelerate to sub-2% levels - a
    truly non-consensus call.'

    it has not been tested in real-time and the chart is only based on back-tested
    performance, so take its output with a grain of salt. As well, the tests show
    that it is useful on timing the entry point to go short, but it is less useful
    on exit conditions.
