## Poundstone

### May 30, 2007

Nearly finished [Fortune’s Formula](https://etrading.wordpress.com/2007/05/24/fortunes-formula/). I recommend it very strongly. It’s central theme is the [Kelly criterion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion). Thanks to jd long’s comment, I realise how much Poundstone has in common with Taleb. They both think that many current trading approaches ignore the Black Swan. Kelly is all about ensuring the Black Swan, or fat tail event, doesn’t wipe you out.
