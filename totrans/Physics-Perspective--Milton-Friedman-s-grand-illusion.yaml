    the General Equilibrium approach. Several of them mentioned Milton Friedman in
    their defense, saying that he had shown long ago that one shouldn't worry about
    the realism of the assumptions in a theory, but only about the accuracy of its
    predictions. I eventually found the paper to which they were referring, a classic
    in economic history which has exerted a huge influence over economists over the
    past half century. I recently re-read the paper and wanted to make a few comments
    on Friedman's main argument. It rests entirely, I think, on a devious or slippery
    use of words which makes it possible to give a sensible sounding argument for
    what is actually a ridiculous proposition.

    the motions of the planets quite accurately (in many cases) even if the planets
    are treated as point masses having no extension, no rotation, no oceans and tides,
    mountains, trees and so on. The great triumph of Newtonian dynamics (including
    his law of gravitational attraction) is it's simplicity -- it asserts that out
    of all the many details that could conceivably influence planetary motion, two
    (mass and distance) matter most by far. The atmosphere of the planet doesn't matter
    much, nor does the amount of sunlight it reflects. The theory of course goes further
    to describe how other details do matter if one considers planetary motion in more
    detail -- rotation does matter, for example, because it generates tides which
    dissipate energy, taking energy slowly away from orbital motion.

- en: But I don't think anyone would be tempted to say that Newtonian dynamics is
    a powerful theory because it is descriptively false in its assumptions. It's assumptions
    are actually descriptively simple -- that planets and The Sun have mass, and that
    a force acts between any two masses in proportion to the product of their masses
    and in inverse proportional to the distance between them. From these assumptions
    one can work out predictions for details of planetary motion, and those details
    turn out to be close to what we see. The assumptions are simple and plausible,
    and this is what makes the theory so powerful when it turns out to make powerful
