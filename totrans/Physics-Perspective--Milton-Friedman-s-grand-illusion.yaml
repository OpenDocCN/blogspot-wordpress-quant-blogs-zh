    model whole economies. Today's General Equilibrium models -- and their slightly
    more sophisticated cousins, Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium models -- make
    assumptions with no basis in reality. For example, there is no financial sector
    in these model economies. They generally assume that the diversity of behaviour
    of all an economy's many firms and consumers can be ignored and simply included
    as the average behaviour of a few "representative" agents.

    modeling tools, including agent based models, in which the diversity of interactions
    among economic agents can be included along with a financial sector. The idea
    is to model the simpler behaviours of agents as well as you can and let the macro-scale
    complex behaviour of the economy emerge naturally out of them, without making
    any restrictive assumptions about what kinds of things can or cannot happen in
    the larger economy. This kind of work is going forward rapidly. For some detail,

    the General Equilibrium approach. Several of them mentioned Milton Friedman in
    their defense, saying that he had shown long ago that one shouldn't worry about
    the realism of the assumptions in a theory, but only about the accuracy of its
    predictions. I eventually found the paper to which they were referring, a classic
    in economic history which has exerted a huge influence over economists over the
    past half century. I recently re-read the paper and wanted to make a few comments
    on Friedman's main argument. It rests entirely, I think, on a devious or slippery
    use of words which makes it possible to give a sensible sounding argument for
    what is actually a ridiculous proposition.

    read. Essentially, it seems, Friedman's aim is to argue for scientific standards
    for economics akin to those used in physics. He begins by making a clear definition

    ethical position or normative judgments. As he wrote, positive economics deals

    involved in the initial formation of a hypothesis, and in the testing of that
    hypothesis, are not as distinct as people often think, Indeed, this is obviously
    so. Many scientists form a hypothesis and try to test it, then adjust the hypothesis
    slightly in view of the data. There's an ongoing evolution of the hypothesis in
    correspondence with the data and the kinds of experiments of observations which
    seem interesting.

    as their "realism" can be judged independently of the validity of predictions,
    the relation between the significance of a theory and the "realism" of its "assumptions"
    is almost the opposite of that suggested by the view under criticism. Truly important
    and significant hypotheses will be found to have "assumptions" that are wildly
    inaccurate descriptive representations of reality, and, in general, the more significant
    the theory, the more unrealistic the assumptions... The reason is simple. A hypothesis

    assumptions in General Equilibrium theories. Their point was that having unrealistic
    assumptions isn't just not a problem, but is a positive strength for a theory.
    The more unrealistic the better, as Friedman argued (and apparently proved, in
    the eyes of some economists).

    is his use of the provocative terms such as "unrealistic" and "false" and "inaccurate"
    in places where he actually means "simplified," "approximate" or "incomplete." 
    He switches without warning between these two different meanings in order to make
    the conclusion seem unavoidable, and profound, when in fact it is simply not true,
    or something we already believe and hardly profound at all.

    the motions of the planets quite accurately (in many cases) even if the planets
    are treated as point masses having no extension, no rotation, no oceans and tides,
    mountains, trees and so on. The great triumph of Newtonian dynamics (including
    his law of gravitational attraction) is it's simplicity -- it asserts that out
    of all the many details that could conceivably influence planetary motion, two
    (mass and distance) matter most by far. The atmosphere of the planet doesn't matter
    much, nor does the amount of sunlight it reflects. The theory of course goes further
    to describe how other details do matter if one considers planetary motion in more
    detail -- rotation does matter, for example, because it generates tides which
    dissipate energy, taking energy slowly away from orbital motion.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But I don't think anyone would be tempted to say that Newtonian dynamics is
    a powerful theory because it is descriptively false in its assumptions. It's assumptions
    are actually descriptively simple -- that planets and The Sun have mass, and that
    a force acts between any two masses in proportion to the product of their masses
    and in inverse proportional to the distance between them. From these assumptions
    one can work out predictions for details of planetary motion, and those details
    turn out to be close to what we see. The assumptions are simple and plausible,
    and this is what makes the theory so powerful when it turns out to make powerful
    and accurate predictions.

    assumptions -- all planets are perfect cubes, etc. -- it would be less powerful
    by far because it would be less believable. It's ability to make predictions would
    be as big a mystery as the original phenomenon of planetary motion itself -- how
    can a theory that is so obviously not in tune with reality still make such accurate
    predictions?

- en: Of course, there is a place in science for unrealistic assumptions. A theory
    capturing core realities of a problem may simply be too difficult to work with,
    making it impossible to draw out testable predictions. Scientists often simplify
    the assumptions well past the point of plausibility just to be able to calculate
    something (quantum gravity in one dimension, for example), hoping that insight
    gained in the process may make it possible to step back toward a more realistic
    theory. But false assumptions in this case are merely tools for getting to a theory
    that doesn't have to make false assumptions.

    essay. He suggested that economic theories should be judged solely on the precision
    of their predictions, not the plausibility of their assumptions. But he never
    once in the essay gave a single example of an economic theory with unrealistic
    or descriptively false assumptions which makes impressively accurate predictions.
    A curious omission.
