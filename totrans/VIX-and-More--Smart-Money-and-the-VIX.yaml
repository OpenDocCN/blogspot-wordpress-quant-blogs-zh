    Outlook](http://www.schaeffersresearch.com/commentary/observations.aspx?ID=20929&obspage=1)”
    is generally an excellent perspective for any trader to contemplate going into
    the trading week.  This week’s commentary is one of the better ones, as Schaeffer
    looks at a variety of data points to consider whether or not the markets may be
    putting in a bottom.'

    overtake the recent investor complacency.  Schaeffer cites the VIX as an example
    of continuing complacency in his remarks and in so doing goes on to make a potentially
    more interesting claim that he and his colleagues believe the VIX action represents
    the maneuverings of the smart money:'

    which was little changed even while the market moved defiantly into losing territory.
    In fact, the supposed ‘fear barometer’ has shown little signs of alarm for a few
    weeks now, preferring instead to shuffle sideways. It has yet to make a significant
    move above the 30 level or come within sniffing distance of its mid-August peak.*'

- en: '*However, the VIX action presents some very interesting possibilities. Its
    continued inability to move below the 32-week trendline is bearish, as we''ve
    pointed out before. But I wonder whether the fact that the November spike has
    fallen short of the August spike might actually be bullish in its implications,
    in the sense of a ‘non-confirmation’ of the pullback, rather than the conventional
    view that this is a bearish indicator of complacency. **This interpretation would
    only make sense if you felt the VIX represented smart money, an evolving conclusion
    that we at Schaeffer''s have reached over the course of this year*** [emphasis
    added]*. Note that you could consider the VIX spike in the first quarter to be
    a non-confirmation relative to the spike in the second quarter of 2006, as it
    fell shy of the 2006 peak. The spike to higher VIX highs in August then ‘confirms’
    the bearish trend, and by that reasoning (assuming the VIX has, in fact, peaked)
    the current spike is another non-confirmation with bullish implications.”*'

- en: Setting aside the caution-complacency issue for the moment, I find it interesting
    that Schaeffer believes the VIX is the footprints of the smart money.  I am slowly
    coming to the same conclusion myself and will attempt to address this issue a
    little more scientifically in this space in the future.
