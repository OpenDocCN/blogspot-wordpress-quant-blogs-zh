    \ assets such as different types of futures, swaps, options, and more exotic derivatives.\
    \ According to the traditional view of \Nnancial innovation, these assets facilitate\
    \ the diversi\Ncation and the sharing of risks. However, this view does not take\
    \ into account that market participants might naturally disagree about how to\
    \ value \Nfinancial assets. The thesis of this paper is that belief disagreements\
    \ change the implications of \Nnancial innovation for portfolio risks. In particular,\
    \ market participants\x92' disagreements naturally lead to speculation, which\
    \ represents a powerful economic force by which fi\Nnancial innovation increases\
    \ portfolio risks."

    can be used to speculate and gamble. This increases risks in the market. More
    derivatives and more complete markets is not always a good thing, as standard
    financial theory would have it.

    work should be spread far and wide. That this idea comes as news to the academic
    finance community shows how deeply confused they have become by the received wisdom
    of market completeness as an ideal. They (at least many) do believe that UP =
    DOWN, and so news to the contrary sounds radical. In the article I''ve mentioned
    several other earlier studies (I''ve written about them here before, just search
    on "derivatives") that point to the same conclusion: more derivatives in general
    leads to more market instability (again, as most people already believe).'

    this idea.
