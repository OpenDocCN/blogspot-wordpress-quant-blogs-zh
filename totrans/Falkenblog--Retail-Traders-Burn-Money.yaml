- en: This paper investigates the trading performance of retail brokerage investors
    on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) from 1990 to 2005\. We document average
    losses per day, before transaction costs, of USD$120,000 (AUD$190,000) or 27 basis
    points per day from individual investors buying (selling) higher (lower) than
    the closing price on the day. This loss is robust across calendar years, stock
    size, order type, time of day and broker service offerings. Net of this loss,
    individual buy trades are statistically indistinguishable to sells at a 254-day/1
    year window.

    a bid-ask spread, independent of his commission. He also is no better than throwing
    darts.

- en: My only issues is I wish they would have compared the fill price to the open,
    because by comparing it to the close that day, or the VWAP (value weight average
    price) that day, you ignore how much you actually move the price. This 'trade
    impact' is often large, especially for big trades. There's a tradeoff, such that
    really small traders with little trade impact tend to pay the highest in bid ask
    spread, and commissions, while the big guys have fancy trading algorithms to minimize
    the effect of the bid-ask spread (buy, say, having a program that patiently buys
    at the bid), but their trade impact is significant. By comparing the fill price
    to the prior day's close, you capture trade impact.

    the value-weighted average price. But they ignored the fact that if you move the
    VWAP upward significantly, equalling the VWAP doesn't mean it was a good fill.
