    story a little earlier. In [Time for an In-VIX-Tigation?](http://adamsoptions.blogspot.com/2008/10/time-for-in-vix-tigation.html)
    Adam wonders about the large number of SPX options trades at the open today.

    to involve the purchase of close to 300,000 puts (all of which were opening transactions
    for that strike) and a grand investment of about $150 million.

    opening quotation (for the settlement of VIX options) of 63.04, a 9.93 (18.7%)
    jump over yesterday's close. If I am able to unearth any additional details about
    this transaction, I will pass them along.
