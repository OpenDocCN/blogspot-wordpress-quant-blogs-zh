    range. The accompanying hourly chart shows that whenever the 14-hour RSI reaches
    an overbought extreme of 90 or more, it has retreated to a minimum level of 50,
    which it has in the latest episode. In light of the powerful momentum exhibited
    by the Zweig Breadth Thrust buy signal in early November, the market has met the
    conditions for another bull run in the near future.
