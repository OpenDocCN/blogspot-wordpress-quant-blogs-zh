    Index against the SPX. As regular readers are aware, I have been concerned about
    the lack of broad based capital expenditures during the current mid-cycle phase
    of the US expansion. I therefore started monitoring the relative performance of
    a CapEx Index, consisting of an equal weighted index of cap-weighted Industrial
    stocks (XLI), equal-weighted Industrial stocks (RGI), because I wanted to measure
    Industrial performance without the dominance of heavyweight GE, and semi-conductor
    stocks (SMH), as they are represent a key component of the highly cyclically sensitive capital
    goods business, relative to the SP 500.

    lagged. But the MCHP announcement was the shocker that made the story of slowing
    global growth that much more real. Moreover, it highlights the transmission mechanism
    of how slowing non-US growth can affect US companies.

    not just restricted to the US. The chart below shows the relative returns of European
    Industrials (they're called "engineering companies" over there) against DJ Europe
    in the top panel and equal-weighted Industrial stocks vs. the SPX in the bottom
    panel. Note how the patterns of relative weakness parallel each other, which signals
    a broad based weakness in this sector.

    weakness is the MACD crossover, shown in the bottom panel. Past instances of MACD

    such as the Greek default crisis of 2010, the eurozone crisis and Washington budget
    impasse of 2011\. This time, there appears to be no broad based consensus of a
    fundamental reason for the market weakness. That leads me to believe that we are
    seeing a correction in risk appetite, which is generally not the pre-condition
    for a bear market or even a major correction. Most likely, the magnitude of this
    pullback will be of the 5-10% variety.

    200 dma readings have descended to pre-2012 levels, which was before the current

    a deeper oversold reading before the current bout of weakness is over.

    Rydex bear and money market fund flows as a % of total fund flows. When the line
    is high, it indicates excessive bearishness and when it is low, excessive bullishness.
    On one hand, fund flow readings are consistent with levels seen in recent interim
    bottoms of the last 5 years. On the other hand, we saw increasing bullishness
    as the market declined on Thursday and Friday, indicating that Rydex investors
    were buying into weakness. Since sentiment indicators are not precise market timing
    indicators, I interpret these conditions as the stock market getting near a bottom,
