    capitulative action in individual large-cap components. It has been a reliable
    indicator of exhaustive movement and has frequently been followed by a substantial
    short-term bounce in the S&P 500\. Readings above 10 have been a fairly rare occurrence
    with only 16 instances in 13 years between 1995 and 2007\. They’ve become more
    frequent recently, though. This is the third time the indicator has moved to 10
    or higher in the last 5 months.

    or higher and then selling when the indicator closes back at 3 or lower would
    have been profitable 100% of the time. The indicator is currently 17 for 17\.
    This does not mean it will work this time. It also does not mean there won’t be
    significant downside before the expected bounce ensues.

    after a 10+ CBI reading. I’d suggest reviewing it.

    ensued under the following conditions: 1) The SPX is trading at a 50-day low.
    2) The CBI moves up to 10 or higher. Seven of the past 17 CBI spikes have occurred
    when then SPX is at least at a 50-day low. Of these seven times, the longest the
    market has continued to drop before beginning a substantial bounce was 3 ½ days.
    The lowest close was 3 days later. The lowest low was 4 days later. Interestingly,
    these were the July 2002 and September 2001 instances listed in the “How Bad Can
    It Get?” study.'

    suggesting a multi-week low should be made by the end of the week.
