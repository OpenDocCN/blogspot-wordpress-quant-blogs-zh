    of 2013 was, at $11.3 billion, the biggest fortnightly inflow since April 2000\.
    Including exchange traded equity funds (ETFs), the number tops $18 billion - well
    over twice the flow to equivalent bond funds.

- en: Investors’ appetite for risk in their portfolios is now at its highest in nine
    years, while an increasing number judge equities as undervalued – particularly
    in Europe. Moreover, investors have reduced cash holdings to 3.8 percent from
    4.2 percent in December. This marks the most positive reading of this measure
    of willingness to hold riskier investment assets since April 2011, though it has
    not reached levels that would represent a contrarian sell signal.

- en: I appreciate that there is powerful positive momentum underlying this rally
    and many of the macro headwinds have turned into tailwinds (i.e., Chinese hard
    landing becoming a soft landing; the ECB taking tail risk off the table; US fiscal
    cliff confrontation averted).   However, with the bears throwing in the towel,
    I am inclined to take some profits and take some chips off the table in the short
    term. We've come too far too fast. With bullish sentiment at such extremes, a
    corrective pullback is highly probable in the short term.
