- en: Since the financial crisis of 2008, an explosion of research has aimed to understand
    what makes financial markets prone to sporadic crises. The potential sources of
    trouble are many, including debt and leverage, financial concentration and the
    problem of “too big to fail,” as well as perverse incentives for bankers to take
    on large risks. Markets go wrong in any of a thousand ways, and, unfortunately,
    it seems that understanding each one requires intimate familiarity with the fine
    details of the financial architecture, contracts, legal regulations, individual
    incentives and so on.

    Network scientists know that the topology of a network – the pattern of links
    or relationships that hold it together – can have a decisive influence on its
    properties. In the context of financial networks, [new research](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14416)
    suggests that subtle changes in network topology may be the key to understanding
    a common pathway by which financial markets become unstable. For all the forbidding
    complexity of the modern financial system, they suggest, instability tends to
    follow from the emergence of particular cycles or closed circuits of dependence
    within the network topology, as these tend to amplify disturbances or distress.

    and not meant as a recipe for detailed practical policy. But it does help clarify
    a basic mechanism that drives instability, and offers broad insights on the kinds
    of policies that could avoid it.

- en: First, a little background. Some of the motivation for this work comes from
    the history of thinking in ecology. Back in the 1970s, ecologists widely believed
    that the stability of an ecosystem would generally be enhanced by increasing complexity,
    as reflected in the presence of a large number of interactions between a diverse
    set of species. But the theoretical ecologist Robert May overturned this intuition,
    at least partly, by showing in simplified network models of food webs that complexity
    can in some cases undermine stability. His analysis indicated that networks with
    a larger number of interactions could be less stable, and inspired ecologists
    to begin searching for possible new factors that might account for ecosystem stability
    – for example, the presence of specific topological motifs within food webs.

    to the UK Government – joined with the Bank of England's Andrew Haldane [in arguing](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v469/n7330/abs/nature09659.html)
    for the relevance of this insight to the stability of financial  systems as well.
    Financial networks have grown enormously more complex in the past 30 years, and,
    as May and Haldane noted, the pre-crisis literature in economics and finance mostly
    viewed this as a good thing. Traditional thinking held that more complexity, achieved
    through a wider spectrum of financial instruments, greater diversification and
    wider spreading of risks, would improve stability. Yet May and Haldane pointed
    to a handful of studies, mostly in the last decade, linking rising complexity
    with increasing instability.

    less “radical,” although the story also remains unsatisfyingly complicated. Models
    serving as examples tend to include fairly intricate details of how financial
    institutions interact – particulars of contracts, for example, or mechanisms for
    debt default resolution. Do such details always play a decisive role? Or is there
    a simple and general story about how changes in network topology create instability
    that stands above the details?

    What Marco Bardoscia and colleagues do is to study a class of models of the Interbank
    network, and probe the stability of the network as they vary two parameters characterizing
    its complexity. These are 1) market integration, reflecting the number of banks
    participating in the financial system, and 2) diversification, referring to the
    proliferation of financial contracts. Importantly, the study doesn't test stability
    in the usual way of running stress tests and estimating the total losses likely
    to amount from some assumed shocks to the system. This approach requires specific
    assumptions on the nature of the financial contracts and mechanisms of distress
    propagation, making it difficult to draw general conclusions.

    pathways in the network can create mechanisms that tend to amplify small disturbances,
    rather than dampening them away. For example, the figure below illustrates how
    the network goes from being stable to unstable just due to gradual diversification,
    normally thought of as beneficial for risk management. It shows a network eigenvalue
    λ[max] reflecting whether the propagation dynamics of the network dampen (λ[max]
    < 1) or amplify (λ[max] > 1) small disturbances. The researchers used the balance
    sheets of the top 50 listed banks in the European Union as a starting point, and
    then simulated a process in which banks gradually increase the degree of diversifi
    cation by creating further exposures towards additional counterparties. They carefully
    rebalanced the network at each stage to keep the assets and liabilities consistent
    with the original balance sheets and the interbank leverages of all banks fixed.
    As the degree of diversi fication increases, a bank's exposures spread out across
    ever more counterparties. Even though the total interbank exposure of each bank
    remains constant, the banking system eventually goes unstable, and it doesn't
    even take a lot of diversification to make it happen. As the figure shows, instability
    first arises when contracts link together just 3% of all the possible pairs that
    could in principle be linked.

- en: This example illustrates the transition from stability to instability as complexity
    increases through diversification. The paper equally establishes that a simular
    transition takes place if complexity rises just through an increase in the number
    of banks.

    tend toward instability. A financial system can go unstable as the number of banks
    increases, or as the number of contracts among banks increases, even if the individual
    leverage of banks does not increase. In either case, instability appears as a
    holistic, network effect, even though each bank individually has an unchanging
    risk profi le. The implication: financial policies that seem wise from the point
    of view of the risks to individual banks can actually – and counter-intuitively
    – increase fi nancial instability to the whole system.'

- en: The paper also goes into some detail on the origin of such instability, which
    lies in the fact that in both processes banks get increasingly involved in multiple
    cycles (i.e. closed chains) of contracts. This is an interesting technical detail
    that I won't get into, although such factors might well prove useful as targets
    for monitoring by authorities. In any event, it's clear that systemic risk cannot
    be reduced through measures long thought to reduce risks in standard economics.
    Banking proliferation and diversification, if excessive, can create worse problems
    than they solve.
