    entered the journalism hack zone. If you presume your audience may not understand
    what a derivative is, it''s safe to say your article''s claim that some old or
    obscure insight has some really important implications for the future of economic
    science, is probably considered via the noob criterion: if I were reasonably intelligent
    but had no clue about finance, would this sound cool? This vetting process leads
    to countless redundant articles on behavioral finance, efficient markets, and
    hubris that people may read and enjoy, but does not increase anyone''s understanding
    of finance.'

    may run off track." OK, do tell!

    been around for at least 30 years. Sure, now we can model fMRI that shows what
    part of the brain lights up when we lose money, but that has not shown anything
    other than that there is a biological substrate to human thought, which I don't
    think anyone ever doubted. It isn't obvious how these facts are related to some
    better model of finance, because it's not like thousands of smart people haven't
    been working with them for decades. Of course economists are predicting the effects
    of individuals interacting, and these people have emotions and are not perfect.
    The problem is most of these 'biases' tend to cancel out or are ambiguous. For
    example, there are biases of over and under-extrapolation that will explain both
    mean reversion and momentum.
