- en: The semiconductor group (SOX) is an ideal indicator, as the semis were not directly
    impacted by the mortgage and banking meltdown. The chart below shows the relative
    performance of SOX against the S&P 500 Technology Index. Technology had led much
    of the rally since late last year and this relative chart shows the performance
    of the more cyclical semiconductor group against broader Technology stocks.

    bound relative to Technology stocks. Despite Intel’s positive report last week,
    there is no sign of a recovery from this cyclically sensitive industry.
