# Quantitative Trading: Futures markets have no effect on spot prices

NYTimes columnist and Princeton economist Paul Krugman has previously (see my link

[here](http://epchan.blogspot.com/2008/05/are-high-oil-prices-due-to-hedge-fund.html)

) argued that the trading of oil futures should have no effect on spot oil prices, contrary to what many politicians and pundits think.

[Here](http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/21/calvo-on-commodities/)

is his latest elaboration of that argument.
