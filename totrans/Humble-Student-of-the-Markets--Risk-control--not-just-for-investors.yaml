    be careful not to stage this stunt in a jurisdiction where there is a "stand your
    ground" law. Let's just suppose that a so-called weapon carrying patron came upon
    this scene. Would he feel justified to shoot the actress playing the Carrie-like
    character, especially if he saw the demonstration that she had unknown psychic
    powers and he felt that his personally safety was threatened?
