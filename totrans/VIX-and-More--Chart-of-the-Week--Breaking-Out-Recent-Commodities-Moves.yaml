    looks at [commodities](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/commodities),
    where base metals (blue line) and energy (red line) began to bottom just after
    the middle of February, about 2 ½ weeks before stocks put in a bottom. Interestingly,
    agriculture (green line) bottomed on March 2^(nd), just before stocks found their
    bottom. Precious metals, which marches to the beat of a very different drummer
    during periods of economic stress, bottomed back on November 12^(th) and made
    its most recent high on February 23^(rd), just as base metals and energy began
    to rally.

- en: The chart below captures the action in four commodity sub-sector ETFs since
    February 17^(th). The chart shows the base metals ETF ([DBB](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/DBB))
    to be the strongest performer during this period. While DBB has faltered in the
    past few days, energy ([DBE](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/DBE))
    has surged. Agriculture ([DBA](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/DBA))
    has recently joined the bull party and with concerns about rising interest rates
    heating up, even precious metals ([DBP](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/DBP))
    have started to rally as well.

- en: It would not surprise me if 3-4 of these commodity sub-sector ETFs outperform
    the S&P 500 index for the rest of 2009\. At the very least, they could provide
    some important portfolio diversification and a potential hedge against inflation.
