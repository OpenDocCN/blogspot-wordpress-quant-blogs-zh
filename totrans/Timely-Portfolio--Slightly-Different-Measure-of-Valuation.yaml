- en: I grow tired of the tried and true standard measures of valuation, and from
    time to time I try to think of alternate methods.  One thought was to analyze
    [Ken French’s Market(ME) to Book(BE) Breakpoints by percentile](http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/Data_Library/det_me_breakpoints.html). 
    We can see by year at what level is a stock considered cheap relative to the universe. 
    As these breakpoints move higher, the market is willing to pay a higher price. 
    In reverse, as these breakpoints move lower, stocks fetch a lower price or can
    be considered cheaper.  Since there are 20 fifth percentiles, a horizon plot can
    provide a good overall look at this measure of valuation.

    1926.

    mean - 1.

    stocks, but of course, there is lots of research to be done.
