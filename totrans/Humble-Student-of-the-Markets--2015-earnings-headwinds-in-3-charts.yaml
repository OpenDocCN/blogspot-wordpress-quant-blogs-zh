    As the chart shows, net margins appear to be peaking for large caps (blue line)
    and they seem to be definitely rolling over in mid and small cap stocks.

    the bottom-up sales-per share (SPS) and earnings-per-share (EPS) estimates for
    the S+P 500 as proxies for expected sales and earnings for the index over the
    next few quarters, profit margin estimates can be calculated by dividing the expected
    EPS by the expected SPS for each quarter. Using this methodology, the estimated
    net profit margins for Q1 2015 through Q4 2015 are 9.8%, 10.4%, 10.7%, and 10.7%.
    These numbers (starting in Q2 2015) are above the net profit margin for Q4 2014
    (10.1%), and are also well above the average net profit margin of 9.4% recorded
    over the past five years.

    in calculation (and interpretation). John Butters takes a snapshot of current
    EPS and sales projections and divide earnings by sales to arrive at quarterly
    margin projections by quarter. He finds that net margins are expected to rise
    on a quarterly basis.

    point, he divides the forward estimate earnings by forward estimated sales to
    arrive at a forward net margin for each point in time. This technique is stylistically
    similar to how John Butters comes up with his forward EPS line (shown in blue)
    in the chart below.

    are likely to affect EPS expectations, I believe that Ed Yardeni has the better
    approach.
