    As the chart shows, net margins appear to be peaking for large caps (blue line)
    and they seem to be definitely rolling over in mid and small cap stocks.

    the bottom-up sales-per share (SPS) and earnings-per-share (EPS) estimates for
    the S+P 500 as proxies for expected sales and earnings for the index over the
    next few quarters, profit margin estimates can be calculated by dividing the expected
    EPS by the expected SPS for each quarter. Using this methodology, the estimated
    net profit margins for Q1 2015 through Q4 2015 are 9.8%, 10.4%, 10.7%, and 10.7%.
    These numbers (starting in Q2 2015) are above the net profit margin for Q4 2014
    (10.1%), and are also well above the average net profit margin of 9.4% recorded
    over the past five years.

  zh: 分析师们也预计利润率在2015年会继续扩大。使用标普500指数的自下而上的每股销售额（SPS）和每股盈利（EPS）估计作为指数未来几个季度的预期销售和盈利的替代指标，利润率估计可以通过将预期的每股盈利除以预期的每股销售额来计算每个季度的利润率。使用这种方法，2015年Q1到Q4的预期净利润率分别为9.8％、10.4％、10.7％和10.7％。这些数字（从2015年Q2开始）高于2014年Q4的净利润率（10.1％），也远高于过去五年平均净利润率9.4％的水平。
- en: Both Yardeni and Butters are correct, the difference can be explained by a difference
    in calculation (and interpretation). John Butters takes a snapshot of current
    EPS and sales projections and divide earnings by sales to arrive at quarterly
    margin projections by quarter. He finds that net margins are expected to rise
    on a quarterly basis.

  zh: Yardeni 和 Butters 都是正确的，他们之间的差异可以用计算（和解释）的差异来解释。John Butters 对当前每股盈利和销售预测数据进行快照，并通过将盈利除以销售得出了按季度的净利润率预测。他发现净利润率预计将会按季度上升。
- en: Ed Yardeni calculates the evolution of the forward net margin. For each data
    point, he divides the forward estimate earnings by forward estimated sales to
    arrive at a forward net margin for each point in time. This technique is stylistically
    similar to how John Butters comes up with his forward EPS line (shown in blue)
    in the chart below.

  zh: Ed Yardeni 计算了前瞻净利润率的演变。对于每个数据点，他将前瞻收益估计除以前瞻销售估计，得出了每个时间点的前瞻净利润率。这种技术在风格上类似于
