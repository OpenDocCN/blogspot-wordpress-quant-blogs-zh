- en: A 45 year old married father of two with a mortgage and a pair of college educations
    to fund. The remote yet persistent threat of a nuclear war is not what keeps him
    up at night. In fact, he might almost see it as a relief should it come. He is
    a bundle of raw nerves, and each day brings even more dread and foreboding than
    the day before. What’s frying his nerves and impinging on his amygdala all day
    long is something far scarier, after all. He, like everyone else, is afraid that
    he doesn’t have a future.

    history, with the masses buying in not out of avarice, but from a mentality of
    abject terror. Robots, software and automation, owned by Capital, are notching
    new victories over Labor at an ever accelerating rate. It’s gone parabolic in
    recent years – every industry, every region of the country, and all over the world.
    It’s thrilling to be a part of if you’re an owner of the robots, the software
    and the automation. If you’re a part of the capital side of that equation.

    stocks are not a gimmick or a fad, they’re a f***ing life raft. Market commentators
    rhetorically ask aloud what multiple should investors pay to own the technology
    giants. That’s the wrong question when people feel like they’re drowning.
