- en: With the [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures)
    for January and February still trading in the 47-48 range, the consensus opinion
    is that a 42 is not sustainable. In fact, supporting that opinion is the flurry
    of activity in the January 70 and 75 calls in the past few minutes, as speculators
    (and perhaps hedgers) jump at the pre-Christmas sale prices on [VIX options](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20options).
