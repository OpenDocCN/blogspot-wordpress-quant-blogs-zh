- en: In recent days, the blogosphere has gotten excited about a potential turnaround
    in gold and gold stocks. Specifically, technicians have pointed to the rally in
    gold (top panel of chart), the gold stock to gold ratio (GDX/GLD, middle panel)
    and the better performance of high-beta silver to gold ratio. All of these point
    to better times for the bullion price.

    to analyze the excitement about the possible technical breakout in gold and gold
    stocks.

- en: First of all, consider the chart above, but with a five-year time horizon. An
    examination of the longer term pattern shows that only the GDX/GLD ratio (middle
    panel) has staged a rally out of a relative downtrend and now displaying a sideways
    basing pattern.

    long-term downtrends. A more bullish interpretation could be that these two ratios
    have rallied out of relative downtrend (dotted lines) and they are now consolidating
    sideways (shown in grey).

    performance for inflation hedges like gold?
  prefs: []

- en: Yes, but other charts of inflationary hedges have not confirmed the upside breakouts
    in gold and gold stocks. The relative performance of TIP to AGG (Barclays Aggregate
    Bond Index) shows that TIPS have started to turn around in relative performance
    against the bond market. However, we have not seen any signs of a breakout.

    the SPX shows a similar pattern of a rally out of a relative downtrend, but XME
    remains in a sideways relative consolidation pattern.

    golds having moved so far so fast, they are a little extended here. I would like
    to wait for more conclusive evidence of upside breakouts before jumping on the
    gold bull story.

    hat if you want, but I would remind readers who are overly dogmatic about gold
    that the ultimate truth about being a gold bug can be found
