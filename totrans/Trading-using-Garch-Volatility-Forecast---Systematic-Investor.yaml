    article [Regime Switching System Using Volatility Forecast](http://quantumfinancier.wordpress.com/2010/08/27/regime-switching-system-using-volatility-forecast/).
    The article presents an elegant algorithm to switch between mean-reversion and
    trend-following strategies based on the market volatility. Two model are examined:
    one using the historical volatility and another using the Garch(1,1) Volatility
    Forecast. The mean-reversion strategy is modeled with RSI(2): Long when RSI(2),
    and Short otherwise. The trend-following strategy is modeled with SMA 50/200 crossover:
    Long when SMA(50) > SMA(200), and Short otherwise.'

    from tseries package and garchFit function from fGarch package. The garch function
    from tseries package is fast but does not always find solution. The garchFit function
    from fGarch package is slower but does converge more consistently. To demonstrate
    the speed difference between garch function and garchFit function I created a
    simple benchmark:'

    forecast volatility I will try to use garch function whenever it can find a solution
    and garchFit function otherwise.
