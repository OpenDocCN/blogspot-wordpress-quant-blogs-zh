    on commodity positions until a spate of commodity-related ETFs began appearing.  Perhaps
    the next frontier for these former “equities only” investors is [currencies](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/currencies).

    zero-sum game, but if anyone doubted their importance, just look how the markets
    have changed since the [dollar](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/dollar)
    reversed its course and started moving up a month ago.

    ETF, the dollar ETF whose formal name is the PowerShares DB US Dollar Bullish
    Fund.  This ETF is based on the Deutsche Bank Long US Dollar Index Futures Index,
    where futures contracts are designed to replicate the performance of being long
    or short the US Dollar against the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian
    dollar, Swedish krona and Swiss franc.  For more details, a good place to start
    is the [UUP fact sheet](http://dbfunds.db.com/USdollar/Pdfs/UUP_UDN_Fact_Sheet.pdf).

    the course of the past month and is now breaking out of a [three year downward
    channel](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/08/eight-year-view-of-dollar.html),
    the dollar’s move is more the result of increasing concerns about foreign economies
    than it is about strength in the U.S. economy.  The bottom line: the U.S. economic
    outlook has not improved over the past month; instead, things have taken on an
    even gloomier tone overseas.'

    tend to react favorably to a rising dollar.  The chart of the UUP shows the dollar’s
    rally off of the July low buffeting the S&P 500 index.
