    breakout level as a bullish signal. In addition, the Trend Model dashboard of

    however, the markets may need a bit more time to consolidate their gains. The
    chart below of the SPX shows that the 5-day RSI, which is useful for swing trading,
    has descended from an overbought condition. Such reading often signal a market
    pullback. However, a glance at the SPX chart in the bottom panel shows that the
    index remains above its breakout levels and support is nearby at 2090-2100, which
    is less than 1% below the current level of 2105.
