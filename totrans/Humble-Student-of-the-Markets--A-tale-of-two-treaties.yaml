    in response from Berlin. Since then, the two partners have quarreled like an old
    married couple nearly every chance they get, bickering over everything from a
    joint budget for the eurozone to the details of the digital services tax on major
    tech companies like Google and Apple and emission limits for nitrous oxide. In
    addition, Germany's aspirations to become a permanent member of the United Nations
    Security Council are only halfheartedly supported by France. "I'm afraid there
    are a ton of issues where we have to get our act together," a government official
    in Berlin complained.

    only a few weeks after the declarations of mutual devotion in Aachen, the two
    countries came within a hair's breadth of a major diplomatic spat.

    order around the world, and Paris views its military as a natural instrument of
