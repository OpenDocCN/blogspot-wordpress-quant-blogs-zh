- en: I am delighted to see that [JunkDEX Tracks Speculative Frenzy in Financials](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/08/junkdex-tracks-speculative-frenzy-in.html)
    and the [JunkDEX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/JunkDEX) itself
    appear to have hit a nerve and have generated such positive feedback.

- en: To some extent, one could argue that the selection of the individual components
    of the JunkDEX was done in a somewhat arbitrary fashion and consequently, the
    performance of the index is somewhat biased by the hand-picked issues that tell
    a particular story.

- en: I already mentioned the exclusion of Freddie Mac ([FRE](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/FRE)),
    largely because the company’s business, financial history and stock performance
    is so similar to that of Fannie Mae ([FNM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/FNM)).
    I also looked at Lehman Brothers ([LEHMQ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/LEHMQ)),
    which gave us the [LEHVIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/06/lehvix.html),
    among other memories. LEHMQ was up 200% on Friday and is up another 50% so far
    today. I even toyed with the idea of General Motors ([MTLQQ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/MTLQQ)),
    but as both of these issues trade on the pink sheets, I did not want to venture
    into that netherworld.

    individual component performance charts for the JunkDEX. The first chart covers
    the full span of the JunkDEX, dating back to the beginning of 2009\. It shows
    particularly strong performance on the part of Fannie Mae and American International
    Group ([AIG](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/AIG)):'

- en: 'The second chart reflects performance in each of the five components over the
    course of the last five weeks. Given the relatively short time frame for this
    data, I find the percentage changes to be even more interesting. While FNM and
    AIG are still the top performers, both Citigroup ([C](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/C))
    and CIT Group ([CIT](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/CIT)) have doubled
    during this period. Bank of America ([BAC](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/BAC)),
    which is weighted down by a market cap of $153 billion, is considerably less nimble,
    yet still has a gain of 37% in the past five weeks:'

    a gain.
