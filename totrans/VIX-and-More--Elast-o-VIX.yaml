    events of last week gave us an opportunity to [examine](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/03/vix-spikes-and-echo-volatility.html)
    what happens when the VIX spikes 30% or more in one day.  For the most part, the
    conclusion was that spikes of this magnitude generally represent a near-term VIX
    top; save some [echo volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/echo%20volatility)
    spikes, they also indicate that the VIX should trend down from a large spike.'

    engine working overtime to snap the VIX back down from the low 20s to 15.  In
    an unprecedented move, the VIX fell over 15% twice within five trading days, dropping
    16% on 2/28 and 19% yesterday.  Interestingly, the last time two 15% drops fell
    in reasonably close proximity was in June 2006, when they were ten days apart.  Prior
    to that, there were only nine 15% drops in the previous 17 years and only two
    of those occurred in the decade leading up to the events of last June.

    number by the end of the trading day, I thought it might be instructive to look
    at the only three times in VIX history that it has fallen 20% in one day: 9/22/93;
    4/15/94; and 6/15/06.'

    I have included here in the past, the chart below takes the three data points
    above and normalizes the aggregate end of day values at 100 for the day in which
    the VIX fell 20% (also indicated with a “0” on the X axis and a vertical dashed
    line through it.)  Here I have included the aggregate pricing data for the five
    days leading up to the 20% VIX drop (-5 to -1) and the twenty days immediately
    following the drop (1 to 20.)

- en: The graph itself should tell the rest of the story.  Personally, I found it
    most interesting that the 20% VIX drop was – at least in this historical context
    – a mean-reverting reaction that reversed three days of increasing volatility
    rather than striking out in a new direction.  Interesting perhaps, but not surprising,
    as it is consistent with one of the [recurring themes](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/02/one-day-20-spikes-in-vix.html)
    in this blog.
