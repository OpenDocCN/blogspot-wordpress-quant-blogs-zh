    by focusing on the first principal component or “PC1.” After rotation has been
    completed it is possible to derive weights or portfolios for each principal component.
    Another good primer on using PCA for asset allocation is written by a reader of
    the blog- Dr. Rufus Rankin. The link for this book is [here](https://amzn.to/2NH5XPz).
    We can separate the PC1 portfolio which represents broad systematic risk by dividing
    it into two dimensions- Offense (Risk On) and Defense (Risk Off)- by isolating
    positive versus negative weights. To form each portfolio you would simply take
    the absolute value of each weight and divide it by the sum of absolute values
    of weights for each of the Offense and Defense portfolio. In this example we will
    use 8 core asset classes for the sake of simplicity- Domestic Equity, Emerging
    Market Equity, International Equity, Commodities, High Yield Bonds, Gold, Intermediate
    Treasurys, Long-Term Treasurys. Here is the PC1 Offense Portfolio using the in
    sample period from 1995-2018 on various ETFs with extensions using indices:'

  zh: 在上一篇文章中，我们展示了如何使用PCA通过关注第一主成分或“PC1”来创建进攻型和防御型投资组合。旋转完成后，可以为每个主成分推导出权重或投资组合。博客读者Dr.
    Rufus Rankin撰写了一篇关于使用PCA进行资产配置的优秀入门文章。该书的链接是[这里](https://amzn.to/2NH5XPz)。我们可以通过将正负权重分离，将代表广泛系统性风险的PC1投资组合分为两个维度——进攻（风险偏好）和防御（风险规避）。要形成每个投资组合，只需将每个权重的绝对值除以进攻和防御投资组合中权重的绝对值之和。在这个例子中，为了简单起见，我们将使用8个核心资产类别——国内股票、新兴市场股票、国际股票、商品、高收益债券、黄金、中期国债、长期国债。以下是使用1995-2018年样本内期间各种ETF及其指数扩展的PC1进攻型投资组合：

    emerging markets have the highest weighting, while international and domestic
    equity have nearly equal weightings. Equity overall has the highest weighting
    in the offense portfolio which is logical. Commodities take second spot while
    assets such as high yield bonds and gold have smaller weightings. In general this
    portfolio makes sense: for the most part when the market goes down and systematic
    risk is very high, all of these asset classes have a tendency to fall. However,
    during a bull market, these asset classes tend to do very well. In contrast when
    we look at the PC1 Defense Portfolio and it looks predictably like the opposite
    of the offense portfolio:'

  zh: 该投资组合显示，一些较为激进的资产类别，如新兴市场，权重最高，而国际和国内股票的权重几乎相等。总体而言，股票在进攻型投资组合中权重最高，这是合乎逻辑的。商品位居第二，而高收益债券和黄金等资产的权重较小。总体来看，这个投资组合是合理的：在大多数情况下，当市场下跌且系统性风险非常高时，所有这些资产类别都有下跌的趋势。然而，在牛市期间，这些资产类别往往表现良好。相比之下，当我们查看PC1防御型投资组合时，它看起来与进攻型投资组合截然相反：

    treasurys that has historically performed quite well during recessionary periods
    or other periods when systematic risk is high. The performance of both the PC
    1 Offense and Defense Portfolios over time is plotted in the graph below.

- en: 'In the graph we can clearly see the inverse correlation between the PC1 Offense
    and Defense Portfolios. Both obviously perform well at different times as we would
    expect. A simple tactical model would be to hold the PC1 Offense portfolio when
    systematic risk is low and to hold the PC1 Defense portfolio when risk is high.
    To do this we can simply use the 200-day simple moving average strategy on the
    PC1 Offense portfolio on a daily basis (generating an equity curve by using the
    weights of PC1 and rebalancing this portfolio monthly) and holding the PC1 Offense
    portfolio when risk is on- the equity curve is above its 200-day sma- and holding
    the PC1 Defense portfolio when risk is off- the equity curve of PC1 Offense is
    below its 200-day sma. We can give this simple strategy a name- “2D Asset Allocation”-
    which represents the two dimensions that we have separated the asset class universe
    into: Offense and Defense. The performance of this strategy is shown below:'

  zh: 从图中我们可以清楚地看到PC1进攻和防御组合之间的负相关性。显然，两者在不同时间表现良好，正如我们所预期。一个简单的战术模型是，在系统性风险较低时持有PC1进攻组合，在风险较高时持有PC1防御组合。为此，我们可以简单地使用PC1进攻组合的200天简单移动平均策略（通过使用PC1的权重并每月重新平衡该组合来生成权益曲线），并在风险来临时持有PC1进攻组合——权益曲线高于其200天sma——在风险消退时持有PC1防御组合——PC1进攻组合的权益曲线低于其200天sma。我们可以给这个简单策略起个名字——“2D资产配置”——它代表了我们将资产类别范围划分为进攻和防御两个维度的做法。该策略的表现如下所示：

    well even during the 2015 period which was difficult for traditional momentum/trend-following
    strategies. Below is a table showing the summary statistics. A good tactical strategy
    will ideally perform better than the buy and hold version of its underlying offense/defensive
    components over a full market cycle. Clearly the 2D Asset Allocation does substantially
    better than either component in isolation.

  zh: 这一简单策略的表现相当不错，甚至在2015年这一传统动量/趋势跟踪策略艰难时期也能表现良好。以下是一张显示摘要统计数据的表格。理想的战术策略应在整个市场周期中优于其基础进攻/防御组件的买入并持有版本。显然，2D资产配置策略远优于单独的任一组件。
- en: '![](img/1eb65a4ed9eb4a868a994c1069e322c3.png)The best part about this strategy
    is that it was by no means “curve-fit” since the 200sma is a well-established
    strategy and is not the optimal strategy on the PC1 Offense portfolio. Using PCA
    to reduce dimensionality and derive this portfolio is a well-established statistical
    practice. The only caveat is that this portfolio was derived “in sample” which
    is less than ideal but no different than the starting place from which traditional
    system developers create trading strategies via backtests. Perhaps a better way
    to do this would be to using a rolling or anchored PCA analysis to derive the
    two portfolios instead on a walk forward basis. The choice of asset class universe
    in this case was designed to capture major asset classes, but the good thing about
    PCA is that you can use just about any asset class universe you want without introducing
    undue bias by choosing an arbitrary subset. In either case, this is a good example
    of how tactical asset allocation can be greatly simplified. Refinements to the
    strategy could include holding a minimum allocation to PC1 Defense for diversification
    purposes or potentially using momentum within the PC1 Offense and Defense portfolios
    to overweight/underweight different holdings. The possibilities are endless.'

  zh: 该策略最佳之处在于，它绝非“曲线拟合”，因为200sma是一个久经考验的策略，并非PC1进攻组合中的最佳策略。利用PCA降低维度并构建此组合是一种成熟的统计实践。唯一需要注意的是，该组合是在“样本内”推导出来的，这虽不理想，但与传统系统开发者通过回测创建交易策略的起点并无二致。或许更好的做法是采用滚动或锚定PCA分析，以逐步推进的方式推导出这两个组合。在此案例中，资产类别范围的设计旨在涵盖主要资产类别，而PCA的优势在于，你可以使用几乎任何资产类别范围，而不会因选择任意子集而引入不当偏差。无论哪种情况，这都是战术资产配置得以极大简化的一个良好例证。对策略的改进可能包括为实现多元化目的而持有PC1防御的最低配置，或可能在PC1进攻和防御组合中运用动量来超配/低配不同持仓。可能性无穷无尽。
