    violin practice, etc. I think if kids want to practice for 3 hours, great. If,
    like me, you hated practicing instruments, it just teaches you to hate it even
    more. By clearly going too far on an otherwise good idea, it makes fun fodder
    for commenters.'

    games deprived them of essential, nay, dominant skills in managing status rivalries,
    negotiating group dynamics, understanding social norms, navigating the distinction
    between self and group. These are the really important skills learned in childhood.

    kind of competence is you can't really monitor them, and what you can't monitor,
    you can't instruct, drill, or correct, other than simple things like teaching
    your kids to say please and thank you, and to see 'getting mad' as basically an
    internal failure. So, while letting your kid play with other kids is essential,
    I don't see it as a more important parenting strategy because kids will naturally
    work these skills without prompting. Math, reading, and writing, are not natural
    activities, and there's a brief window in childhood where one can put these concepts
    into their brain efficiently. As they were discovered a mere 5 millenia ago, our
    monkey brains need external stimuli from outsiders old enough to know they are
    actually important to force us to focus on these skills. On the other hand, our
    brains were made to master speech and social networks, so that doesn't need so
    much guidance.

    and manageable, is a very important distinction. It is far more important your
    kids have common sense than know calculus, but while you do you best every day
    in teaching common sense, it isn't really something to address directly. You can
    and should, however, make them learn their math tables.
