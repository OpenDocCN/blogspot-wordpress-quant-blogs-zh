    [fear](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/fear) starting to leave the
    markets.

- en: As I type this the VIX is down 2.00 and the SPX is down about 15\. The fact
    that the VIX and SPX are both moving down this morning is unusual, but not unheard
    of. What makes the situation even more interesting is that it is happening on
    a Monday, when the VIX typically 'springs ahead' to account for the '[calendar
    reversion](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/calendar%20reversion)'
    effect in which the VIX is priced according to the calendar, but only calculated
    during trading days. The long and the short of this is that market makers tend
    to drop option prices on Fridays in anticipation of the coming weekend and raise
    them on Mondays.

- en: We now have two Mondays in a row without any of the jaw-dropping end-of-the-world
    headlines many investors have come to fear. For that and other reasons, there
    markets seem to be less caffeinated this morning and the VIX is finally starting
    to feel the effects of gravity.
