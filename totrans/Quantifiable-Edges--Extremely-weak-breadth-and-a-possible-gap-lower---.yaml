- en: The IBD Follow Through Day study seems to be generating a lot of interest, and
    I promise I will get back to it shortly. The market looks to be setting up for
    some interesting trading tomorrow morning, though – so I thought I’d focus on
    more pressing issues.

    somewhat unusual and can be a sign of panic. Lowry’s was the first group I’m aware
    of to do extensive study on “90% days” and they have

    this around midnight Dow futures are down 100 points, S&P 500 futures are down
    12 points and Nasdaq futures are down a whopping 32 points. Asian markets are
    also taking it on the chin.

    Going back to 1970, there were one hundred and thrity-two 90% downside days identified

    week looked:'

    There is more downside to come more often than not.

    there have been thirty-six 90% down volume days on the NYSE. Of those 36, only
    5 times has the SPY gapped lower the next morning by more than 0.25%. With a gap
    lower looking likely, I thought it might be worth taking a look at those occurrences:'

- en: The 90% downside day on its own won’t necessarily wash out the market, but when
    combined with gap down open it typically has served to mark at least a short-term
    panic low. Although the sample size for this study is smaller than I typically
    like, should the gap down occur, the consistent and sizable gains in the study
    above indicate that traders should be aware of a potentially large intraday reversal.
