    forums after reading a copy of "Practical Time Series Forecasting," -- 2nd edition,

    and creative data scientist or amateur enthusiast to participate in and learn
    a wealth of new knowledge and tricks from more experienced professionals in the
    field.

    many of the winners that participate in these high purse contests are often from
    the financial world. Take one of my personally inspirational traders, Jaffray
    Woodriff, hedge fund manager of well-known machine learning oriented hedge fund,
    Quantitative Investment Management (better known by its acronym - QIM). I had
    mentioned recently to a surprised friend, that Mr. Woodriff had also participated
    in the more well-known Netflix prediction contest (having been a member of the
    third-place team at one point).

    is the $3,000,000 Heritage Provider --Heritage Health Prize Competition, which
    is an open contest to predict likelihood of patient hospital admission. What particularly
    inspired this blog post is a very useful blog from one of the leading contestants,
    Phil Brierley a.k.a. handle, Sali Mali, who has interestingly joined with the
    marketmaker team, also affiliated with a prediction related fund. Mr. Brierley
    has shared tremendously useful insights about practical methods of attacking the
    problem-- all the way from SQL preprocessing and cleaning to intuitive visualization
    methodologies. I applaud him for his generous sharing of insights to the rest
    of the predictive analytics community.  Although he hasn't posted in a while,
    his journal of thoughts are still highly useful.
