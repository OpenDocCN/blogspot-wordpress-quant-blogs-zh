    Partner Program who all offer capital markets solutions, as well as current and
    former Microsoft employees, customers, and non-partners working with Microsoft
    Capital Markets. Aite Group found that Microsoft''s strategy of developing its
    vertical partnership program may have hurt its reputation, as 55% of partners
    in this program rate their overall satisfaction with Microsoft as mediocre or
    poor. Though Microsoft is criticized for its lack of knowledge of the capital
    markets vertical, it is viewed favorably for its architecture and engineering,
    as well as for its technical support."While Microsoft''s horizontal rivals, including
    IBM and Oracle, were busy building capital markets offerings through acquisitions,
    Microsoft maintained a partner program whereby it supplied the underlying platform
    upon which other software providers could build vertically specific solutions,"
    says [Adam Honoré](mailto:ahonore@aitegroup.com "Email Adam Honoré @ Aite Group,
    LLC"), senior analyst with Aite Group and author of this report. "As a vertical
    strategy, Microsoft is not the feared giant it is perceived to be in many horizontal
    venues. Instead, Microsoft has much work to do before it is perceived as anything
    other than a mediocre performer in its vertical go-to-market strategy." |'
