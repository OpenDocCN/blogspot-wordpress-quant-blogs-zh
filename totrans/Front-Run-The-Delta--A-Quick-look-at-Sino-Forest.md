Lots of

about Sino Forest lately.

[gotten in](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-27/sino-forest-investor-chandler-boosts-stake-to-15-to-become-largest-holder.html)

.  Needless to say, there's been some turmoil in the shares, which happen to be dual listed in the US and Canada.  Shares trade under the tickers

and

[TRE](http://tmx.quotemedia.com/quote.php?qm_symbol=tre&locale=EN)

, and are listed in USD and CAD respectively.  The following are built from trade-and-quote (TAQ) data recorded July 26, 2011\.  

The arbitrage relationship between the implied CAD value of the USD-listed shares and the real CAD-listed shares breaks momentarily during the open.  This deviation from parity meant that the CAD shares could have been sold 15 cents above the relative value of USD shares.
