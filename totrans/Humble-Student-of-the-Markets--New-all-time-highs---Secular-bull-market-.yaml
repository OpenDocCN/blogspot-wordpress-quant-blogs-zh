    never sank to levels befitting a true secular buying point. That’s debatable.
    At the intraday low of March 6, 2009 (the infamous “666”), the SP 500 traded at
    just 10.1x our 5-yr. Normalized EPS estimate—only half a point above the median
    P/E of 9.6x seen at the last four secular bear market lows. Close enough for government
    work, in our view. On the other hand, the SP 500 dividend yield at that historic
    low amounted to just half the median of 6.7% seen at the prior four lows.

    valuation measures will prove to be lasting secular lows. In the context of zero

    to expect valuations to match those seen in conjunction with the double-digit

    a mere five years into the supposed secular upswing. Even the P/E on forward EPS—though

    with subsequent 10-year stock returns, and the least extreme among them (the SP
    500 12-Mo. Trailing P/E) still stands higher than about three-quarters of its
    history—with those earnings lifted by margins higher than 100% of their history.
    Three measures (Price/Cash Flow, Price-to-Book, and Price/Dividend) have moved
    into their ninth historical decile, and the SP Industrials Price/Sales ratio is
    now on a path into late-1990s bubble territory.
