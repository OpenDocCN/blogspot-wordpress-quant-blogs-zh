    first time since 9/11, the prognosis for the VIX over the next month or so is
    as bearish as it has ever been.

- en: Keeping in mind the history above, there are many possible investment approaches
    if one expects history to repeat itself.  Being short volatility or short the
    VIX should be a central portion of that strategy.  [Neutral calendar spreads](http://www.theoptionsguide.com/neutral-calendar-spread.aspx)
    are a relatively conservative approach; [put back spreads](http://www.theoptionsguide.com/put-backspread.aspx)
    would be more appropriate for an aggressive investor.  Those wishing to strictly
    limit risk should probably also be looking at [iron butterfly](http://www.theoptionsguide.com/iron-butterfly.aspx)
    and [iron condor](http://www.theoptionsguide.com/iron-condor.aspx) strategies.

    even more so than in more ‘normal’ markets, one should always plan exits before
    placing any trade and use stops wisely.  Better yet, if you are not used to trading
    options, this is not the time to start experimenting.

    apply to the VIX, not to the broader markets, which are usually negatively correlated
    with the VIX.)
