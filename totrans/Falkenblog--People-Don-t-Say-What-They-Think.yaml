- en: First, teachers were asked if they valued creativity and enjoyed working with
    creative students, and they overwhelmingly answered "yes".

    of creativity of the student and his favorable rating by the teachers. This means
    that the most creative students were the least favorite of the teachers, across
    the entire sample surveyed. Additionally, the students that were rated as favorites
    of the teachers possessed traits that would seem counter-productive to creative
    behavior, such as conformity and unquestioning acceptance of authority. On the
    other hand, these are behaviors that fit well in a classroom setting. Even back
    in 1975, Feldhusen and Treffinger reported that 96% of teachers felt that creativity
    should be promoted in the classroom. However, when asked which students they actually
    liked to teach, they chose the students that were more compliant.

    In this study (as well as in many others), they found that there is a discrepancy
    between what teachers, and schools in general, say they value and desire, and
    what behaviors they actually reward and encourage. Teachers don't want the student
    who is always raising their hand and questioning the assignment; they want the
    student who unquestioningly follows the outline given to them and turns the assignment
    in on time.

- en: Professors love creative students, as demonstrated by those who extend their
    work in predictable yet difficult dimensions. The 'creativity' is evidenced merely
    by embracing their own paradigm shifting work. A truly creative person, like a
    true risk taker, is seen as a crank in real-time, and indeed on average they are.
    But sometimes the cranks are right, at which time they are then seen as geniuses.

    Risk-taking of a regular sort that leads to failure is considered just dumb, or
    worse, full of hubris. Creativity is great if it generates an obviously valuable
    thing, otherwise, it's annoying, and just inappropriate.

- en: I once read an article that accompanied an exposition on the Capital Asset Pricing
    Model, and its implication that expected return was positively related to risk
    (via the 'beta', now an anachronism). They asked a bunch of well-known portfolio
    managers about their greatest risks, and each one was an unqualified success.
    This gives one the feeling that risk is related to return, because in these biased
    samples they are. Kids, and adults, should know that risk-taking usually fails,
    and so the only key is to know when to stop and when to keep trying, learning
    along the way.
