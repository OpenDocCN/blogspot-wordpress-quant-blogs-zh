- en: First, teachers were asked if they valued creativity and enjoyed working with
    creative students, and they overwhelmingly answered "yes".

  zh: 首先，教师们被问到他们是否重视创造力并且喜欢与有创造力的学生一起工作，他们大多数都回答“是”。

- en: Interestingly, there was a significant negative correlation between the degree
    of creativity of the student and his favorable rating by the teachers. This means
    that the most creative students were the least favorite of the teachers, across
    the entire sample surveyed. Additionally, the students that were rated as favorites
    of the teachers possessed traits that would seem counter-productive to creative
    behavior, such as conformity and unquestioning acceptance of authority. On the
    other hand, these are behaviors that fit well in a classroom setting. Even back
    in 1975, Feldhusen and Treffinger reported that 96% of teachers felt that creativity
    should be promoted in the classroom. However, when asked which students they actually
    liked to teach, they chose the students that were more compliant.

  zh: 有趣的是，学生创造力的程度与教师对其的好评之间存在显著的负相关。这意味着整个采样样本中，创造力最强的学生是教师最不喜欢的学生。此外，被教师评为最喜欢的学生具有似乎与创造性行为相背离的特征，如顺从和毫无质疑地接受权威。另一方面，这些行为在课堂环境中确实是合适的。甚至早在1975年，费尔德哈森和特雷芬格报告说，96%的教师认为应该在课堂上促进创造力。但是，当被问到他们最愿意教哪些学生时，他们选择更顺从的学生。

- en: Teachers say they want creativity, but that is not the behavior that is rewarded.
    In this study (as well as in many others), they found that there is a discrepancy
    between what teachers, and schools in general, say they value and desire, and
    what behaviors they actually reward and encourage. Teachers don't want the student
    who is always raising their hand and questioning the assignment; they want the
    student who unquestioningly follows the outline given to them and turns the assignment
    in on time.

  zh: 教师们说他们希望学生有创造力，但实际上却并不重视这种行为。在这项研究（以及许多其他研究）中，他们发现教师和学校普遍认为自己重视和欣赏的东西与他们实际奖励和鼓励的行为的价值观有差异。教师们不希望学生总是举手和质疑作业的行为；他们想要无条件地遵循所给的规定并且按时提交作业的学生。
- en: Professors love creative students, as demonstrated by those who extend their
    work in predictable yet difficult dimensions. The 'creativity' is evidenced merely
    by embracing their own paradigm shifting work. A truly creative person, like a
    true risk taker, is seen as a crank in real-time, and indeed on average they are.
    But sometimes the cranks are right, at which time they are then seen as geniuses.

  zh: 教授们喜欢有创造力的学生，正如那些在可预测但困难的维度上扩展自己的工作所示。这种“创造力”仅仅通过接受自己的范式转变的工作来证明。一个真正有创造力的人，就像一个真正的冒险家，在现实中被视为古怪，实际上他们平均是的。但有时，这些古怪的人是正确的，这时他们就被视为天才。
- en: Like risk-taking, what these creativity lovers mean is, they like positive surprises.
    Risk-taking of a regular sort that leads to failure is considered just dumb, or
    worse, full of hubris. Creativity is great if it generates an obviously valuable
    thing, otherwise, it's annoying, and just inappropriate.

  zh: 就像冒险一样，那些热衷于创造力的人指的是，他们喜欢积极的惊喜。那些导致失败的常规冒险被认为是愚蠢的，甚至更糟糕，充满了傲慢。只有创造出明显有价值的东西时，创造力才是伟大的，否则，它很烦人，而且不合适。
- en: I once read an article that accompanied an exposition on the Capital Asset Pricing
    Model, and its implication that expected return was positively related to risk
    (via the 'beta', now an anachronism). They asked a bunch of well-known portfolio
    managers about their greatest risks, and each one was an unqualified success.
    This gives one the feeling that risk is related to return, because in these biased
    samples they are. Kids, and adults, should know that risk-taking usually fails,
    and so the only key is to know when to stop and when to keep trying, learning
    along the way.

  zh: 我曾经阅读过一篇文章，配合了对资本资产定价模型的阐述，以及其意味着预期收益与风险呈正相关（通过“贝塔”，现在已经成为过时的概念）。 他们询问了一群著名的投资组合经理关于他们最大的风险，而每一个都是毫无保留的成功。
    这让人觉得风险与回报相关，因为在这些偏颇的样本中是这样。 孩子们，以及成年人，应该知道冒险通常会失败，所以唯一的关键是知道何时停止和何时继续尝试，在学习的过程中。
