    overview of the agile release [train](http://scaledagileframework.com/agile-release-train/)
    is worth reading.  Release trains aren’t new, they been around for years in both
    agile and non-agile organisations. Release trains aid in a consistent push to
    production, and work around certain black-out dates when production can’t be touched
    e.g. Christmas, end of month etc.  Sometimes certain train dates are also aligned
    to key business deliverables which although maybe anti-agile is some ways, are
    from a commercial perspective relevant.'

- en: One item that is often not well discussed around agile [iterations](http://scaledagileframework.com/iterations/)
    is pre-iteration dependencies.  Specifically these occur around interface boundaries,
    and the user interface (particularly if its complex).  Complex interactions can
    clearly be broken into smaller stories, but sometimes there are dependencies and
    assets (business workflows etc) that maybe required in preparation prior to entering
    the development [iteration](http://scaledagileframework.com/iterations/).
