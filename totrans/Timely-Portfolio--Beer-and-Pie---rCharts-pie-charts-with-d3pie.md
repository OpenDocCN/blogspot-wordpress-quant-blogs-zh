# Timely Portfolio: Beer and Pie | rCharts pie charts with d3pie

> 来源：[http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2014/07/beer-and-pie-rcharts-pie-charts-with.html#0001-01-01](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2014/07/beer-and-pie-rcharts-pie-charts-with.html#0001-01-01)

In honor of the 4th of July, I thought a quick example of a pie chart on beer using the wonderful new [d3pie library](http://d3pie.org) would be appropriate.  The rCharts binding with d3pie is simply an experiment now, but expect more in the near future.

Using slidify and rCharts, I created a more complete [writeup of the experiment](http://timelyportfolio.github.io/rChartsExtra/d3pie) with [d3pie](http://d3pie.org) if you would like to play with it yourself.
