- en: A quick reminder for anyone holding [VIX options](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20options)
    or contemplating VIX options trades in the next day or two that the last day of
    trading for VIX March options is tomorrow. VIX options expire on Wednesday, with
    [settlement](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20SOQ) at the open
    of trading for SPX options on Wednesday morning. For those that have not done
    so already, I recommend bookmarking the [OCC options expiration calendar](http://www.theocc.com/publications/xcal/xcal2009.pdf),
    which I have included as a permanent link in the right hand column of the blog.

- en: As VIX [options expiration](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/options%20expiration)
    approaches, I am reminded of one trader who likes to go long iron [condors](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/condor),
    usually on Monday or Tuesday, in a bet that the VIX will be relatively quiet prior
    to expiration. The iron condor trade is very similar to [A VIX Butterfly Play](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/02/vix-butterfly-play.html),
    which I described last month (see also [Follow Up to “A VIX Butterfly Play”](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/02/follow-up-to-vix-butterfly-play.html)),
    with one exception that the condors have a wider maximum profit zone, but smaller
    maximum upside. There are some other practical differences between a butterfly
    and condor as well, notably that the condors are less likely to require follow-up
    position adjustments and additional commissions. Perhaps more germane to the trade
    above, it is sometimes appropriate to let condor trades run to expiration, but
    this is rarely a desirable approach for butterflies.

    this morning. I call these pre-expiration trades “expiration condors.”
