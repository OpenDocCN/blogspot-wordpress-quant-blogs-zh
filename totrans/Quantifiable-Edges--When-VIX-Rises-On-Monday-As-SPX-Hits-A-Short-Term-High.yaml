- en: I am seeing a mix of short-term evidence at the moment.  Having not shown anything
    bearish lately, I decided to share the study below, which triggered at the close
    on Monday and hints of a downside edge.  It looks at times during long-term uptrends
    that the VIX closes up on the first day of the week while the SPX is closing at
    a 10-day high.  Most of the time the VIX and SPX will trade in opposite directions.
    The VIX has a natural tendency to fall on Fridays and rise on Mondays.  Due to
    this, Monday is the most common day of the week to see VIX rise in conjunction
    with SPX.  This study appeared in the Quantifinder yesterday afternoon, and I
    have updated all stats below.
