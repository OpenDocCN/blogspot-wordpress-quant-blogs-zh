    with the red line showing confidence for consumers with annual incomes greater
    than $50K and the blue line showing confidence levels for consumers with incomes
    between $35K and $50K. While the two consistently tracked each other relatively
    closely, in the current recovery the confidence gap has been steadily widening.
    We have highlighted this trend numerous times over the years, but as the recovery
    has progressed, the gap has only widened.

    average to smooth out month to month moves. At a current average spread of 30.8,
    the gap is now less than half a point less than its all-time record high of 31.17
    reached in June. One would expect that as we get deeper and deeper into the economic
    recovery, the rising tide would start to lift all boats, but for lower income
    Americans the pickup in confidence has been under pressure. Anyone reading the
    papers in the last several months has read about the widening gap between the
    rich and poor, and these numbers show how it has impacted confidence.
