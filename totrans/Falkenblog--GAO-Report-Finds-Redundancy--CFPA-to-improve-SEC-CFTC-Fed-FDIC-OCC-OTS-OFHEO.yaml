    a new perpetual bureaucracy that will somehow do what the other regulators and
    various state insurance regulators were supposed to do but did not. The solution
    to a conspicuous disaster is to simply add another regulator. A recent nonpartisan

    never have enough government research), Fair Lending and Equal Opportunity (which
    led to the last boondoggle), and tracking complaints (the old suggestion box,
    something that existing agencies could never have accommodated). Their first step
    will probably either be really lame (eg, adding places to initial on mortgage
    applications), or really destructive (making something consumers want illegal,
    thus driving it to less scrupulous markets as in pay-day lending).

    returns and assets under management, so that investors are not duped into some
    fad based on selectively hinted returns released to the press and repeated by
    unskeptical reporters. They could also take over the job of monitoring the performance
    of the rating agencies, so that there's a consistent and unbiased set of data
    on what various ratings mean (currently, the agencies do this themselves, and
    often do not report sub-categories like munis, government debt, or asset-backed
    securities). Yet, I'm sure other agencies have the ability to do these things,
    and for some reason do not, so I'm not optimistic.
