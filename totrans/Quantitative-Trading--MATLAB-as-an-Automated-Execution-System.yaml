- en: As I mentioned before, I now find MATLAB to be a good platform not just for
    backtesting, but for automated execution as well. Of course, not all brokerages
    have API's that connect to MATLAB. My example codes are for submitting orders
    automatically to an Interactive Brokers account.

- en: In general, I find that writing execution programs in MATLAB is a breeze compared
    to C++, Java or even C#. It takes about 1/5 the development time of a C++ program.
    Any performance limitations will probably not be due to MATLAB, but to the latency
    of your brokerage in updating positions and order status.
