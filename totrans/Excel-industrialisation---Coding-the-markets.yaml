    series of posts on Excel VBA Industrialisation](http://blog.alignment-systems.com/search/label/Excel%20Industrialisation)
    on [his blog](http://blog.alignment-systems.com). It’s a topic dear to me, so
    I figured I’d better respond. In his posts JG presents a series of VB Extensions
    based techniques to enable the export of embedded VB from a spreadsheet, so it
    can be version controlled, as well as techniques for error logging and reporting.
    The code is out there on [github](https://github.com/JohnGreenan), and it’s a
    valuable addition to the public domain, especially since there are several commercial
    offerings addressing this space. For instance, [spreadgit](http://spreadgit.com/),
    [ClusterSeven](http://www.clusterseven.com/) and [Finsbury Solutions](http://www.finsburysolutions.com/).
    JG kicks off his discussion in part one by observing that VBA is in the doldrums,
    and that the cool kids are using MEAN, Scala, OCaml or Haskell. Sure, the cool
    kids are never going to use VBA. But that’s not just because other languages are
    cooler, it’s because VBA and the latest programming languages are aimed at completely
    different audiences. Scala, OCaml & Haskell are for developers, and Excel is for
    non developers, end users, business users. The very reason for Excel’s phenomenal
    success and ubiquity is because it enables end users to create software solutions.
    Apparently there are [eleven million professional software developers](http://www.infoq.com/news/2014/01/IDC-software-developers)
    in the world. But even those eleven million can’t meet the world’s demand for
    software, so end users have to generate their own solutions, and they use Excel
    to do it. The result is, as JG points out in the [comments to part six](http://blog.alignment-systems.com/2015/03/excel-vba-industrialisationpart-six.html?showComment=1427590236378#c5959579053154491774)
    in his series: “In many cases the requirement for Excel Industrialisation is for
    a firm with an existing portfolio of ‘000s of spreadsheets that cannot all, in
    a cost-effective manner, be manually rewritten to conform to a coding standard.”'

    of end user developed spreadsheets. However, it solves only part of the problem.
    Another major underlying factor that causes so many spreadsheet problems is their
    manual, desktop operation. Since Excel is a desktop application, Excel spreadsheets
    must be manually operated by their users. Users have to start up Excel, load the
    sheet, key in unvalidated data, hit F9, and then copy & paste or email the results
    out. All of that is error prone. And all of this manual operation is a major factor
    preventing any organised, systematic testing. All of these problems were writ
    large with the [London Whale](http://baselinescenario.com/2013/02/09/the-importance-of-excel/).
    All these problems could be resolved if we could decouple Excel as a development
    environment from Excel as a runtime. It’s great that end users can develop their
    own solutions in Excel, but it’s burdensome and error prone for this solutions
    to be operated manually on desktop PCs. Those solutions should be automated, resilient
    and scalable, and hosted by a server side rumtime. That, of course, is [SpreadServe](http://spreadserve.com/industries/).
