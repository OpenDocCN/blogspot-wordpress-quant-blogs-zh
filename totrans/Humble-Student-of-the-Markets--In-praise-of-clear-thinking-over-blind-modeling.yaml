    work, and they appear to be at a severe competitive disadvantage when trying to
    find a job.*** The concern is that the long-term unemployed may remain on the
    sidelines, ultimately dropping out of the workforce. But ***the data suggest that
    the long-term unemployed look basically the same as other unemployed people in
    terms of their occupations, educational attainment, and other characteristics.***
    And, although they find jobs with lower frequency than the short-term jobless
    do, the rate at which job seekers are finding jobs has only marginally improved
    for both groups. That is, we have not yet seen clear indications that the short-term
    unemployed are finding it increasingly easier to find work relative to the long-term
    unemployed. This fact gives me hope that a significant share of the long-term
    unemployed will ultimately benefit from a stronger labor market.

- en: A final piece of evidence of slack in the labor market has been the behavior
    of the participation rate–the proportion of working-age adults that hold or are
    seeking jobs. Participation falls in a slack job market when people who want a
    job give up trying to find one. When the recession began, 66 percent of the working-age
    population was part of the labor force. Participation dropped, as it normally
    does in a recession, but then kept dropping in the recovery. It now stands at
    63 percent, the same level as in 1978, when a much smaller share of women were
    in the workforce. ***Lower participation could mean that the 6.7 percent unemployment
    rate is overstating the progress in the labor market.***

    such as the EBA's stress tests or Basel standards for banking. On one hand, there
    is an urge to appear evenhanded by applying a one-size-fits-all approach to regulation.
    On the other hand, the banking industry is filled with people whose jobs is to

    owners at a higher rate than residents. Notwithstanding the debate on the merit
    of such a proposal, the implementation of such a scheme is highly problematical

    accountants and other consultants whose job it is to try and get around these

    such a regulatory regime is to set the default property tax rate at a very high

    set it higher at, say, 5% or 10%. Then create a system which grants owner-occupiers

    to each other, otherwise you wind up with a confusing mishmash of rules. Too often,
    regulators approach the problem from a legal framework and spend too much time
    obsessing over the details of a model or a regulatory regime while glossing over
    the intent of the regulations. That`s when you get rules piled on top of rules,
