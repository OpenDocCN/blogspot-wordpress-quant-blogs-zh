hi dave, that is correct–and interestingly enough what we found was that filtering for stocks like BIDU versus ones that were “breaking down” did not improve performance over the long run—in fact for large cap stocks it actually hurt performance. ie the price/52-week high, or even 60 or 30 day highs. in the case of mid cap and smaller cap stocks this was definitely not the case. with smaller/less liquid stocks, the nearness to a short-term or long term high improved returns and reduced risk–likely because liquidity is more sporadic in these names and everyone tends to buy and sell at once.
great comment
cheers
