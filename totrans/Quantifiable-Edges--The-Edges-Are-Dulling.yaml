- en: This was the first study of the currently active bunch to be posted. The exit
    on this study was based on a close above the 10-day moving average. The S&P 500
    accomplished that today, closing the study. The entry was officially at the close
    on Friday the 18th. Since I didn’t post it until Sunday the 20th, anyone who may
    have taken a trade based on this should have gotten a significantly better entry
    price due to the massive gap down on the 22nd. Even assuming the lousy Friday
    the 18th entry this study would have been good for about a 2.2% gain.

    On Thursday I discussed the “profitable 8” exit strategy. This entailed selling
    on drop in the CBI to 3 or lower or the first profitable close of 8 or lower.
    This strategy, while consistently profitable, would have shaved about 0.6% per
    trade off affected trades.

    the first profitable close of 5 or lower or selling when the CBI hit 3\. A “profitable
    5” exit would have affected only 4 instances. Two of them it hurt the return.
    The other two it helped the return. The net effect using a “profitable 5” strategy
    was slightly positive. An exit at today’s close would have netted about 3.3% from
    the 1/22 entry trigger. If the alternate entry on 1/23 was taken it would be a
    1.1% gain. I will continue to update the CBI until it triggers the standard exit
    reading of 3 or less.

    5 days following the reversal up (1/23). After that the market was likely to rally
    – probably after retesting the lows. It’s too soon to draw any real conclusions
    here, yet.

    Even with less than ideal entries, profits should be available. Profit taking
    seems prudent. While certain studies like Reversal Bars and Nasdaq/Russell indicate
    more upside is likely to come, they also indicate extremely high volatility is
    likely. Wednesday will almost certainly see volatility with the Fed decision due.
    There is nothing wrong with letting some profits ride, but I’d suggest traders
    consider taking at least a portion of their holdings off the table now to protect
    gains. Preserve capital and wait for a better edge.
