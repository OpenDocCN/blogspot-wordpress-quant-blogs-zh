    I dare anybody from any other country anywhere, any time, to find me a battle
    with over 50,000 military casualties—and one civvies died. One! It’s incredible.
    People don’t realize how amazing that is. Those were supermen, there’s no other

    even have great handwriting, even the paragraphs work.
