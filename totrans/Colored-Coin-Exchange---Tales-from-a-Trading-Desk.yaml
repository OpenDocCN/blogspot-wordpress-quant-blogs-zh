- en: Traders create an order by creating and signing a transaction to send x coins
    to the exchange, whereas x is the amount and type of coins they intend to sell.
    Unlike usual transactions, this transaction is not sent to the Bitcoin network,
    but to the exchange instead, along with additional information about the order
    (type, asset to buy, limit, etc.). As soon as the exchange receives a matching
    order containing a second transaction, the exchange creates a third transaction
    that sends the exchanged amounts to the two traders. These three transactions
    together form a trade and are sent to the Bitcoin network for execution. The third
    transaction is also sent to the two traders, so they can immediately reuse the
    proceeds for subsequent transactions. Unfilled or cancelled orders are simply
    discarded.
