    sector this week’s but even indirectly, it is hard to come up with a chart that
    isn’t about the banks. So be it.

- en: This week the [chart of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week)
    is a ratio chart of the volume of advancing issues to declining issues for the
    New York Stock Exchange. There is a considerable amount of noise in the short-term
    for this data, so I have used a ten day and 100 day exponential moving average
    to smooth the data, but retain the important trends. The story in this chart is
    the massive surge in [up volume to down volume](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/up%20volume%20and%20down%20volume)
    during the past four days that has pushed the ratio to levels seen only once before,
    in 1997, for my 18 years of data. In the past, extreme up volume relative to down
    volume has usually been a precursor to a bullish move of one to eight months,
    but in the current market environment, there is no guarantee that historical patterns
    will hold.

    for the broader markets not to follow…
