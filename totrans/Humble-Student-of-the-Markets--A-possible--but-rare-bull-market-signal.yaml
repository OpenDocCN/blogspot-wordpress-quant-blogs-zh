- en: A "Breadth Thrust" occurs when, during a 10-day period, the Breadth Thrust indicator
    rises from below 40% to above 61.5%. A "Thrust" indicates that the stock market
    has rapidly changed from an oversold condition to one of strength, but has not
    yet become overbought.

    1945\. The average gain following these fourteen Thrusts was 24.6% in an average

    begin with a Breadth Thrust.'

    in 2009\. Then, it took seven days for the indicator to complete its task.

- en: To be sure, not all setups turn into buy signals, but failed setups are not
    necessarily bearish either. Here is an example from 2011, when the SPX corrected,
    chopped around for a few weeks and flashed a Zweig buy signal setup. The Breadth
    Thrust Indicator almost achieved a buy signal in the 10 day window on day 9, but
    missed. It did manage to get over the 61.5% mark on day 15 - too late. Nevertheless,
    the market did bottom out that summer and proceeded to rise steadily for the next
    four years - until the recent correction.

    episode to flash a buy signal, which would be indicative of a V-shaped bottom.
    The bulls do have the help of the magazine cover (contrarian) indicator in its
    favor. The latest Businessweek cover is full of bears.

    the SPX would be 2163, which would represent an all-time-high.

    of 15 days that it did, then the SPX would have to get to 2130, or a test of the
    previous highs.

    and possibly achievable. I will be monitoring this indicator and report back should
    it flash a buy signal, on or before the end of the 10 trading day window.
