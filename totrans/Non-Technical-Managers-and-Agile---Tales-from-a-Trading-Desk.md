## Non-Technical Managers and Agile

Code Rant offers a view on coconut [headphones](http://mikehadlow.blogspot.co.uk/2014/03/coconut-headphones-why-agile-has-failed.html).  Some great call-outs:

> Current non-technical agile practitioners still don’t understand where the airplanes come from. They stand in their bamboo control towers with their coconut headphones on and wonder why their software projects still fail.
> 
> If your role is simply asking for estimates and enforcing the agile rituals: stand-ups, fortnightly sprints, retrospectives; then you are an impediment rather than an asset to delivery
