    for me to achieve reasonable confidence that inflation will move back to 2 percent
    over time. That said, ***I would be uncomfortable raising the federal funds rate

    were to fall appreciably further, or if survey-based measures were to begin to
    decline noticeably.***

    give a greater clue to the direction of Fed policy than the headline NFP number.
