    assumption that all returns for an instrument are drawn from the same distribution.
    Second, *ignore theoretical probability distributions* and instead let the data
    speak. Although traders do not use such obtuse words, they constantly echo both
    sentiments.

    The 2010 density shows significant negative difference for positive returns larger
    than 0.02, illustrating why the MVP trailed EFA incrementally worse through the
    year. The large negative peak in 2009 goes a long way towards explaining why MVP
    did not outperform EFA during the rush to the financial crisis bottom. Finally,
    MVP for 2007 has a large negative peak and does not compensate with any positive
    peaks.
