    They represent a means of identifying a type of market pattern that isn’t explicitly
    captured by other indicators.  Gaps or laps up or down are large price moves that
    originate on the open and occur on very positive or negative news that catches
    the market off guard. The following set of definitions apply:'

    criteria which was to be used across a wide variety of stocks. Generally speaking
    the results suggested that one should fade the direction of the gap/lap over the
    next few days. That is, there was a mean-reversion effect to gaps/laps. The issue
    that I found with the research was that the % criteria such as: “gap down<-10%
    then buy”, was not normalized by security which tended to lead to distortions.
    For a small biotech, this is actually a small gap, while for a large cap stock
    this is  a major-sized gap. Furthermore, a gap down of -10% in 2008 was commonplace
    even for large caps, while the equivalent gap for a small/volatile stock would
    be -50% or more. Thus, this method is begging to be normalized, and this can be
    done several different ways but we will stick to a simpler example for this post:'

    for different types of gap setups. It is recommended that you look at extremes
    such as >80th percentile, or at the very least>50th percentile/median to conduct
    your analysis. Don’t have any preconceived notions about how gaps or laps should
    behave. Research indicates that this can be very much stock specific, and also
    category specific (ie small cap versus defensive large cap). On balance, there
    should be a mean-reversion effect, but this will vary depending on whether you
    are looking at up or down gaps/laps and also the magnitude of the gap/lap and
    the longer-term trend etc.
