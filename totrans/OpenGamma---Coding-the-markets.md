## OpenGamma

### October 7, 2009

I’m almost tempted to send my CV to [Kirk](http://kirkwylie.blogspot.com/) – his [OpenGamma startup](http://kirkwylie.blogspot.com/2009/10/opengamma-is-hiring.html) sounds very exciting. I’ve got ticks in most of the boxes Kirk lists, except the pricing stuff, where I’m a bit short. If Kirk’s after a credit pricing coder, maybe he should talk to [Noel](http://www.noelwatson.com/blog/default.aspx).

Kirk’s coyness on his funding is intriguing too. Could it be [Sean](http://www.parkparadigm.com/), [Ken](http://www.hedgehogs.net/pg/profile/keny) or [FTV](http://www.ftvcapital.com/index.html) ?
