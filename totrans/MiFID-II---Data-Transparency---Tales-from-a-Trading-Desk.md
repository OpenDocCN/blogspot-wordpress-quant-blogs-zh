# MiFID II – Data Transparency | Tales from a Trading Desk

## MiFID II – Data Transparency

TABB has an [interesting](http://tabbforum.com/opinions/mifid-ii-its-coming-will-you-be-ready?page=2) article on MIFID II – “MIFID II: It’s Coming. Will You Be Ready?”.  I would agree with the article that data fragmentation is going to be an issue.  I suspect many companies will need to undertake some effort to resolve historical data linkage issues.  KYC will probably be one of the areas that companies needs to resolve data issues in based on RegTechFS [article](http://regtechfs.com/get-your-mifid-ii-kyc-checklist-for-2016/) – think data in CRM system (e.g. salesforce) coupled with various other internal databases that all need to be linked together to effectively offer an audit trail of customer interactions.
