# VIX and More: Portfolio A1 Update for 3/11/07

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/03/portfolio-a1-update-for-31107.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/03/portfolio-a1-update-for-31107.html#0001-01-01)

As the graphic below indicates, Portfolio A1 is currently trailing the benchmark SPX return by 1.5%, in large part due to the performance of PCCC, which is down 14.6% since it was purchased as part of the initial group of five holdings on 2/20.  In spite of the poor performance, PCCC continues to be the top rated stock in our portfolio, though it is likely that without some near-term buying support, the RSI component of our stock ranker will force a sale in the next week or two.

It should be noted that the one stock from the original group of five that has been sold, <place st="on">RIO</place>, did bounce back 6.9% in the past week.  The stock that replaced it, RKT, was up 3.9% in its first week in the portfolio. There are no changes to the portfolio this week.

The equity curve, which is starting to look suspiciously like a [duck](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/03/canary-or-canard_09.html) to me, continues to show a high beta performance.

Current portfolio details are as follows:
