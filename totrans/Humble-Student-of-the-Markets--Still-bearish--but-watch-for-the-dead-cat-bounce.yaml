    or no news Thursday after an upside surprise on 1Q GDP and a relatively unsurprising
    FOMC meeting. After the dust settled, the SPX was down about 2% on the day, which
    is highly unusual given the recent low volatility environment that the market
    has been experiencing.

    The prices of none of the usual diversifying asset classes such as Treasuries
    (IEF, TLT) and gold held up well on the day. This is suggestive of a rush to cash
    - a seemingly margin clerk's market where market participants are forced to de-risk
    for institutional reasons. But that explanation doesn't really hold water, as
    the SPX is only about 3% from its all-time high at the close Thursday. I honestly
    have no idea why the markets went risk-off it did on Thursday, but the lack of
    an explanation suggests that the markets are due for a dead-cat bounce in the
    near future.

- en: As I watched stock prices crater throughout the day, a key characteristic about
    the sell-off was the spike in fear levels seen in the option market. The VIX/VXV
    ratio, which is a measure of the term structure of volatility, moved from a normal
    upward sloping curve to inversion in a single day. As the chart below shows, the
    majority of past VIX inversion, which are marked by dotted vertical lines, have
    historically been reasonably low-risk entry points on the long side of the market
    (also see my previous analysis

    in the short-term. The middle panel of the chart blow shows that the VIX Index
    is at or near the top of an upward sloping channel indicating excessive panic.
    In addition, the bottom panel shows the ratio of the small cap Russell 2000 to
    the large cap SPX. Small caps have been very weak in the last few weeks, but the
    RUT/SPX ratio did not make a new low and confirm Thursday's weakness - a supportive
    sign for the dead-cat bounce case.

    index sliced through the 50 day moving average, which typically acts as a support
    zone, as if the support level was non-existent. Such episodes of dramatic weakness
    are indications of severe technical breakdown. Short-term, the SPX is sitting
    just above a minor support zone at the 1925-1930 level which could serve to arrest
    any further near-term weakness.

    and due for a dead-cat bounce. Intermediate term, however, the crystal ball gets
    a little cloudy. I would like to look at how the market behaves at the obvious
    downside targets at the next two Fibonacci retracement levels of about 1900 and
    1865 and how the fundamental backdrop is developing before making further calls
    on market direction.
