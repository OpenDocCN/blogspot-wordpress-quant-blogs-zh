    best guess at what the investment world will look like in the coming year in conjunction
    with the [Bespoke Investment Group](http://www.bespokeinvest.com/)’s [second annual
    roundtable](http://bespokepremium.com/roundtable/).

    the next two options expiration cycles, I find that forcing myself to think in
    terms of a one year time horizon is a daunting task. Still, just going through
    the process and committing some ideas to paper makes this exercise worthwhile
    and fun.

    turned out to be and for better or (more likely) for worse, this has emboldened
    me to be even more provocative and more specific this year, including some outrageous
    comments about [AAPL](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/AAPL).

- en: “*2011 will mark the rise of volatility as an [asset class](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/asset%20class). 
    Part of the reason for this rise will be the runaway success of VIX-based ETNs
    and ETFs, notably the recently launched [XIV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XIV),
    which will prove that volatility vehicles can be good buy-and-hold investments. 
    [XVIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XVIX) will also prove to be
    a popular and successful buy-and-hold ETN and once liquidity improves, [TVIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TVIX)
    will hit a tipping point and become the darling of day traders.”*
