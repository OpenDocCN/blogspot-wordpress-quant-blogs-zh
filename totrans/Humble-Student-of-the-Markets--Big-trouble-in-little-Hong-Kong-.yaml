    Chinese ink brush landscape paintings and a vase of purple orchids. The political
    mood outside, however, was fraught. Democratic protesters were threatening to
    shut down the global financial hub with an "Occupy Central" sit-in if Beijing
    refused to allow the city to freely elect its next leader.'

    Liaison Office in Hong Kong, the mood soured. Pro-democracy lawmaker Leung Yiu-chung
    asked Zhang whether Beijing would allow any democrat to run for the city’s highest
    office.

    blunt response. “***The fact that you are allowed to stay alive, already shows
    the country's inclusiveness,***" he answered, according to two people in the room
    who declined to be named.

    for years and it isn't as important to China as it was in the past.

    Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC), announced an electoral package
    on Aug. 31 that said any candidate for Hong Kong's chief executive in the 2017
    election had to first get majority support from a 1,200-person nominating panel
    – likely to be stacked with pro-Beijing loyalists.

    a way of not mattering to the market until they matter. Should Chinese growth
    weaken in the near future, there will be a temptation to play the nationalism
    card to distract the populace. In that case, the risk of rising geopolitical tensions
    will present tail-risk that is probably not in too many analysts' spreadsheet
    models.
