    services customers. Usually we are a secretive bunch, and many of the larger financial
    institutions do not like to have themselves used as a reference customer. Which
    makes it all the more interesting that Streambase has been able to persuade these
    customers to go public. Not only that, but Streambase has managed to convince
    Penny Crossman of Wall Street and Technology to rewrite their press release into

    proven themselves to be amazingly effective. They have been able to trot out customer
    references, whereas Coral8 and Aleri have not. This gives the

    evaluation. On the other hand, Aleri, the other final CEP product in PhaseCapital's
    evaluation, fared well with its high-performance, multi-threaded server architecture.

    [Progress Apama](http://www.progress.com/apama), [Coral8](http://www.coral8.com/),

- en: It's very interesting that Phase Capital found that Aleri was the highest performing
    CEP engine. This has confirmed something that I have suspected. Aleri has always
    been touting themselves as the most performant of the CEP engines, and has welcomed
    the other CEP vendors to take the Aleri Challenge. However, it may have been the
    lack of spit-and-polish in Aleri's development environment that may have sunk
    it. I have previously blogged here that I thought that Streambase had the best
    development experience and documentation out of all of the other products.

    deploy," Pritchett says.

- en: I have been saying this for a long long time on this blog --- the quality of
    the CEP engine does not matter as much as the entire ecosystem surrounding the
    CEP engine. You can have the best, fastest, most expressive CEP engine and language,
    but if you don't surround it with a compelling ecosystem, then you are sunk. And,
    Mark Palmer understands this.
