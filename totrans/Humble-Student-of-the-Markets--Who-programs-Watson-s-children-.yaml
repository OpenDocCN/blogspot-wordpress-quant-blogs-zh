    they were not exactly off the charts in terms of what we now popularly call emotional

    leads to similar failings. That should not be surprising, because as with the
    Ming, there is little time for anything beyond the task. There is an incredible
    uniformity in the approach to problem solving, and the sorts of problems that
    can be solved. When I was a professor, I had two Korean students who handed in
    identical exam papers. They went so far as to work out the problems in the same
    steps, put a box around each problem, put identical work in the same place in
    the box. They both even underlined each of the answers twice. It was clear to
    me that one of them must have copied in distinctively uncreative fashion from
    the other. When I called them into my office and confronted them with their identical
    work, they really had no idea why I thought there was a problem. They had not
    cheated, they had been trained with painstaking precision to do things in the
    same way. Thus the form of their work was identical, the process of their solutions
    was identical, and their mistakes were as well.

  zh: 我的经验是，这个过程在现代时代保留下来会导致类似的失败。这并不令人惊讶，因为正如在明朝一样，没有时间做任何超出任务之外的事情。在问题解决的方法和对可以解决的问题类型上，存在着令人难以置信的一致性。当我还是教授的时候，有两个韩国学生交上了完全相同的考试试卷。他们甚至用相同的步骤解题，在每个问题周围画了一个框，把相同的工作放在框中的相同位置。他们甚至每个答案都画了两遍下划线。我很清楚，其中一个人一定是创造性地从另一个人那里复制来的。当我把他们叫到我的办公室，拿出他们相同的工作时，他们真的不知道我为什么认为有问题。他们没有作弊，他们被训练得非常精确地以同样的方式做事情。因此，他们工作的形式相同，解决方案的过程相同，他们的错误也相同。
