    . A human judge engages in a natural language conversation with one human and
    one machine, each of which tries to appear human. All participants are separated
    from one another. If the judge cannot reliably tell the machine from the human,
    the machine is said to have passed the test.

    prices is a very different during times of stress compared to normal times. We
    need different models during crisis and non-crisis and need to be careful in drawing
    conclusions from non-crisis data about what happens in crises and vice versa.

    turmoil or crises, the models are least reliable because we cannot get from the
    failure process during normal times to the failure process during crises. At that
    time the data sample is very small and the stochastic process different. Hence
    the models fail.

    use fat-tailed procedures, such as extreme value theory, to assess the risk during
    crises with pre-crisis data. Techniques such as Markov switching with state variables
    may provide a useful answer in the future. At the moment such models are few and
    far between.

    we can look back to the end result in the Ming itself. Those who passed the examinations
    and entered into the elite offices had the classics down cold. But they didn't
    know much else. How could they, given the efforts and focus required of these
    examinations? And while I don't have much to go on, ***my guess would be that
    they were not exactly off the charts in terms of what we now popularly call emotional
    IQ. But the history of the period suggests that for all the laudable screening,
    those who succeeded to office often did not succeed in the office.***

    leads to similar failings. That should not be surprising, because as with the
    Ming, there is little time for anything beyond the task. There is an incredible
    uniformity in the approach to problem solving, and the sorts of problems that
    can be solved. When I was a professor, I had two Korean students who handed in
    identical exam papers. They went so far as to work out the problems in the same
    steps, put a box around each problem, put identical work in the same place in
    the box. They both even underlined each of the answers twice. It was clear to
    me that one of them must have copied in distinctively uncreative fashion from
    the other. When I called them into my office and confronted them with their identical
    work, they really had no idea why I thought there was a problem. They had not
    cheated, they had been trained with painstaking precision to do things in the
    same way. Thus the form of their work was identical, the process of their solutions
    was identical, and their mistakes were as well.
