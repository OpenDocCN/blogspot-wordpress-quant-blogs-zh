    a month ago, I [remarked](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/01/apropos-of-recent-discussion-about.html)
    on some [comments](http://www.thestreet.com/_tscana/markets/activetraderupdate/10334755.html)
    from [Doug Kass](http://www.seabreezepartners.net/team.asp) about how the markets
    looked a lot like 1994, which was a decidedly down year for equities.  Now Bernie
    Schaeffer tells us that the [WABAC machine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Peabody)
    (not to be confused with the highly entertaining internet archives ‘[wayback machine](http://www.archive.org/web/web.php)’)
    should actually be set to 1995, not 1994.'

    a glorious bull run that lasted through until early 2000.  Those who loaded up
    on long positions in 1994 probably had a substantial hole to dig out of before
    they could enjoy the fruits of the 1995 bull – if they didn’t give up entirely
    in the interim.

    Schaeffer makes the case for parallels with the beginning of the 1995 bull as
    follows:'

    recently pointed out in an article that the SPX''s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio
    fell to 17 as of the third quarter of 2006 - lowest since mid-1995\. Meanwhile,
    the SPX has now gone 221 days without a two-percent correction. This compares
    to the 223-day streak experienced in 1995\.*'

    as the CBOE Market Volatility Index (VXO) currently hovers around levels similar
    to those we saw in 1995\. “*'

    choose to match my outlook with one year over the other, I’d pick 1994 over 1995,
    but what do I know, I’m just living in my own little VIX-centric universe…
