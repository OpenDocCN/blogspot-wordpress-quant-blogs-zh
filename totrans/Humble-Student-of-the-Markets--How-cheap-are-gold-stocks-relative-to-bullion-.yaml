    to gold bullion. The above chart shows the ratio of the PHLX Gold & Silver Index
    (XAU), which has a longer history than the popular Amex Gold Bugs Index (HUI),
    to gold bullion. Since the line is near the bottom of its historical range, it
    suggests that gold stocks are a bargain compared to gold.

    **Production costs are rising** The synthetic tracked the actual index reasonably
    well until 2006 (which was, of course, the out of sample period) when the synthetic
    began vastly outperforming the actual index. Delving further into the model, I
    found that the price divergence was explained by rising production costs of shown
    by the actual gold miners. Recent [analysis](http://www.caseyresearch.com/displayArticle.php?id=1899)
    by David Galland of Casey Research confirms this trend of rising costs at major
    producers Barrick and Newmont.'

    deflates the case that gold stocks are cheap compared to bullion because their
    margins are lower. However, higher costs can be explained either by companies
    mining a lower grade of ore in the current high price environment in order to
    preserve their reserves and asset value (which is bullish), or costs escalating
    out of control and squeezing bottom lines (which is bearish).

    recent experience of [NovaGold](http://www.novagold.com/section.asp?pageid=5414)
    at Galore Creek, I would lean towards the latter as a more likely explanation
    of higher costs.**
