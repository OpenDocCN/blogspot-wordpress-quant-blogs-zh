# Humble Student of the Markets: It's not just about the Fed

**Mid-week market update**: The market reaction to the FOMC decision was mostly a yawn. The Fed raised rates by a quarter-point, which was expected, and Powell refused to commit to further hikes while repeating his data dependency mantra.  As a consequence, the S&P 500 was mostly unchanged from before the decision to after the close. However, the 2-year Treasury yield, which is a proxy for Fed Funds expectations, did ease a little. Fed Funds expectations were mostly unchanged, other than the first easing was pulled from the May 2024 FOMC meeting to March.

The market faces far more sources of volatility than just the Fed.
