    (well last month) has an interesting article on RBS – specifically Fred the Shred
    Goodwin.  The Daily Mail has a similar [article](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2408605/Fred-Goodwin-How-RBS-boss-fiddled-bank-headed-45bn-meltdown.html)
    the day before.  I’ve not read the [book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Making-Happen-Goodwin-British-Economy/dp/147111354X),
    Making it Happen: Fred Goodwin, RBS and the Men Who Blew Up the British Economy,
    but can only imagine the entertainment value based on the newspaper articles.'
