    on the problem of scaling up a people intensive dealer/broker activity: sales
    coverage of clients. He considers the problem from the perspective of scaling
    up the number of clients an individual sales person can cover. In my experience
    there’s another angle – moving up the value chain. I see dealers attempting to
    strip out cost by putting more of their vanilla flow business on electronic channels:
    [Bloomberg](http://www.bloomberg.com), [TradeWeb](http://www.tradeweb.com), [Caplin](http://www.caplin.com)
    based single dealer platforms. In my world that flow is European Govt Bonds, US
    Treasuries, vanilla swaps. Autoquoting, autonegotiation and STP mean that trades
    are priced, executed and settled with no manual intervention. A big advance on
    the voice trading of 10 years ago. A few years back I was toubleshooting on the
    desk when I heard one of our market making traders refuse to take a client voice
    inquiry for a small ticket, he just said “do it on Bloomberg !”'

    margin structured deals, thereby scaling up earning power. Of course constant
    competitive pressure pushes back. Products that were bespoke voice trades become
    electronic trades: for example flys, custom swaps, custom structures.'
