- en: I actually wanted to bet on Lesnar, but on bodog.com it looked like I would
    have to risk $5 to make $1, which seemed too expensive. But Lesnar's a local guy,
    and I heard that he really trains hard, and is just a genetic freak in terms of
    strength. His partners said that Lesnar's ju-jitsu has improved considerably so
    Mir has basically no chance of surprising Lesnar with a knee bar like last year.

    dumb as a post. Here's a picture of me giving Frank the business at the Arnold
    Classic in 2005.
