- en: 'First, Turner mentions that the conventional wisdom about the wonderful self-regulating
    efficiency of markets is really a caricature of the real economic theory of markets,
    which notes many possible shortcomings (asymmetric information, incomplete markets,
    etc.). However, he also notes that this conventional wisdom is still what has
    been most influential in policy circles:'

  zh: 首先，特纳提到关于市场的自我调节效率的普遍看法实际上是对真实市场经济理论的夸张，这种理论指出市场存在许多可能的不足（如不对称信息、市场不完整等）。然而，他也指出这种普遍看法在政策圈仍然最有影响力：
- en: .. why, we might ask, do we need new economic thinking when old economic thinking
    has been so varied and fertile? ... Well, we need it because the fact remains
    that while academic economics included many strains, in the translation of ideas
    into ideology, and ideology into policy and business practice, it was one oversimplified
    strain which dominated in the pre-crisis years.

  zh: .. 为什么，我们可能会问，当我们已经有了如此多样化和富有成效的旧经济思维时，我们还需要新的经济思维呢？... 嗯，我们需要它，因为事实依然是，尽管学术经济学包括许多流派，但在将思想转化为意识形态，以及将意识形态转化为政策和商业实践的过程中，危机前几年占主导地位的是一种过度简化的主流。
- en: 'What was that "oversimplified strain"? Turner summarizes it as follows:'

  zh: 那个“过度简化的主流”是什么呢？特纳将其总结如下：
- en: For over half a century the dominant strain of academic economics has been concerned
    with exploring, through complex mathematics, how economically rational human beings
    interact in markets. And the conclusions reached have appeared optimistic, indeed
    at times panglossian. Kenneth Arrow and Gerard Debreu illustrated that a competitive
    market economy with a fully complete set of markets was Pareto efficient. New
    classical macroeconomists such as Robert Lucas illustrated that if human beings
    are not only rational in their preferences and choices but also in their expectations,
    then the macro economy will have a strong tendency towards equilibrium, with sustained
    involuntary unemployment a non-problem. And tests of the efficient market hypothesis
    appeared to illustrate that liquid financial markets are not driven by the patterns
    of chartist fantasy, but by the efficient processing of all available information,
    making the actual price of a security a good estimate of its intrinsic value.

  zh: 超过半个世纪以来，主流的学术经济学一直关注通过复杂的数学探索如何在市场中互动的经济理性人。得出的结论似乎是乐观的，确实有时过于乐观。肯尼斯·阿罗和 Gerard
    Debreu 说明一个具有完全市场集合的竞争性市场经济是帕累托有效的。新古典宏观经济学家如罗伯特·卢卡斯说明，如果人类不仅在偏好和选择上理性，而且在预期上也理性，那么宏观经济将强烈倾向于均衡，持续的自愿失业成为一个非问题。而有效市场假说的测试似乎说明，流动性金融市场并非由图表幻想的模式驱动，而是由所有可用信息的有效处理驱动，使得证券的实际价格是其内在价值的良好估计。

    of markets seem to have made little progress in getting into the minds of policy
    makers, thwarted by ideology and the very simple story espoused by the conventional
    wisdom. Insidiously, the vision of efficient markets so transfixed people that
    it was assumed that the correct policy prescriptions must be those which would
    take the system closer to the theoretical ideal (even if that ideal was quite
    possibly a theorist''s fantasy having little to do with real markets), rather
    than further away from it:'

  zh: 换句话说，所有显示市场存在许多局限性的经济理论的细微差别似乎并没有在政策制定者的脑海中取得多大进展，因为它们被意识形态和传统智慧所拥护的非常简单的说法所阻碍。不知不觉地，这种对有效市场的看法使人们着迷，以至于认为正确的政策处方必须是那些使系统更接近理论理想（即使这个理想很可能是与真实市场无关的理论家的幻想）的措施，而不是远离它：
- en: 'What the dominant conventional wisdom of policymakers therefore reflected was
    not a belief that the market economy was actually at an Arrow-Debreu nirvana –
    but the belief that the only legitimate interventions were those which sought
    to identify and correct the very specific market imperfections preventing the
    attainment of that nirvana. Transparency to reduce the costs of information gathering
    was essential: but recognising that information imperfections might be so deep
    as to be unfixable, and that some forms of trading activity might be socially
    useless, however transparent, was beyond the ideology...'

  zh: 因此，政策制定者主流的 conventional wisdom 并不是相信市场经济实际上已经达到了 Arrow-Debreu 涅槃境界——而是相信唯一合法的干预措施是那些旨在识别并纠正阻碍达到这种涅槃境界的非常具体的市场不完善之处。透明度以降低信息收集成本是必不可少的：但认识到信息不完善可能如此深重以至于无法修复，并且某些交易活动即使透明也可能对社会无用，超出了意识形态的范畴...
- en: Turner goes on to argue that the more nuanced views of markets as very fallible
    systems didn't have much influence mostly because of ideology and, in short, power
    interests on the part of Wall St., corporations and others benefiting from deregulation
    and similar policies. I think it is also fair to say that economists as a whole
    haven't done a very good job of shouting loudly that markets cannot be trusted
    to know best or that they will only give good outcomes in a restricted set of
    circumstances.Why haven't there been 10 or so books by prominent economists with
    titles like "markets are often over-rated"?

  zh: 特纳进一步论证，市场作为非常易错系统的更细腻的观点并没有产生多大影响，这主要是因为意识形态以及华尔街、公司和从去监管及类似政策中受益的其他方面的权力利益。我认为公正地说，经济学家整体并没有做好大声疾呼市场不能被信任知道最好，或者只有在有限的情况下它们才会给出良好结果的工作。为什么没有出现10本左右由著名经济学家撰写的书，书名比如“市场常常被高估”呢？
- en: 'But perhaps the most important point he makes is that we shouldn''t expect
    a "theory of everything" to emerge from efforts to go beyond the old conventional
    wisdom of market efficiency:'

  zh: 但他所提出的最重要的观点之一是，我们不应该期望从超越市场效率的旧有传统智慧的努力中产生一个“万有理论”：
- en: '...one of the key messages we need to get across is that while good economics
    can help address specific problems and avoid specific risks, and can help us think
    through appropriate responses to continually changing problems, good economics
    is never going to provide the apparently certain, simple and complete answers
    which the pre-crisis conventional wisdom appeared to. But that message is itself
    valuable, because it will guard against the danger that in the future, as in the
    recent past, we sweep aside common sense worries about emerging risks with assurances
    that a theory proves that everything is OK.'

  zh: ……我们需要传达的关键信息之一是，虽然好的经济学可以帮助解决具体问题并避免具体风险，可以帮助我们思考对不断变化问题的适当应对，但好的经济学永远不可能提供危机前传统智慧所表现出的那种确定、简单和完整的答案。但这个信息本身是有价值的，因为它将防止未来像最近过去那样，我们用理论证明一切都很顺利的保证，将常识担忧
    about  emerging risks 一扫而空。

- en: Larry Kotlikoff indeed, echoing Irving Fisher, believes that a system of leveraged
    fractional reserve banks is so inherently unstable that we should abolish banks
    and instead extend credit to the economy via mutual loan funds, which are essentially
    banks with 100% equity capital requirements.8 For reasons I have set out elsewhere,
    I’m not convinced by that extremity of radicalism.9 ... But we do need to ensure
    that debates on capital and liquidity requirements address the fundamental issues
    rather than simply choices at the margin. And that requires

    ...但我们确实需要确保关于资本和流动性要求的辩论解决根本问题，而不仅仅是边际选择。而这需要
