    and re-reading; here are a few short highlights that caught my attention.

    efficiency of markets is really a caricature of the real economic theory of markets,
    which notes many possible shortcomings (asymmetric information, incomplete markets,
    etc.). However, he also notes that this conventional wisdom is still what has
    been most influential in policy circles:'

    has been so varied and fertile? ... Well, we need it because the fact remains
    that while academic economics included many strains, in the translation of ideas
    into ideology, and ideology into policy and business practice, it was one oversimplified
    strain which dominated in the pre-crisis years.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For over half a century the dominant strain of academic economics has been concerned
    with exploring, through complex mathematics, how economically rational human beings
    interact in markets. And the conclusions reached have appeared optimistic, indeed
    at times panglossian. Kenneth Arrow and Gerard Debreu illustrated that a competitive
    market economy with a fully complete set of markets was Pareto efficient. New
    classical macroeconomists such as Robert Lucas illustrated that if human beings
    are not only rational in their preferences and choices but also in their expectations,
    then the macro economy will have a strong tendency towards equilibrium, with sustained
    involuntary unemployment a non-problem. And tests of the efficient market hypothesis
    appeared to illustrate that liquid financial markets are not driven by the patterns
    of chartist fantasy, but by the efficient processing of all available information,
    making the actual price of a security a good estimate of its intrinsic value.

    of markets seem to have made little progress in getting into the minds of policy
    makers, thwarted by ideology and the very simple story espoused by the conventional
    wisdom. Insidiously, the vision of efficient markets so transfixed people that
    it was assumed that the correct policy prescriptions must be those which would
    take the system closer to the theoretical ideal (even if that ideal was quite
    possibly a theorist''s fantasy having little to do with real markets), rather
    than further away from it:'

    not a belief that the market economy was actually at an Arrow-Debreu nirvana –
    but the belief that the only legitimate interventions were those which sought
    to identify and correct the very specific market imperfections preventing the
    attainment of that nirvana. Transparency to reduce the costs of information gathering
    was essential: but recognising that information imperfections might be so deep
    as to be unfixable, and that some forms of trading activity might be socially
    useless, however transparent, was beyond the ideology...'

- en: Turner goes on to argue that the more nuanced views of markets as very fallible
    systems didn't have much influence mostly because of ideology and, in short, power
    interests on the part of Wall St., corporations and others benefiting from deregulation
    and similar policies. I think it is also fair to say that economists as a whole
    haven't done a very good job of shouting loudly that markets cannot be trusted
    to know best or that they will only give good outcomes in a restricted set of
    circumstances.Why haven't there been 10 or so books by prominent economists with
    titles like "markets are often over-rated"?

    can help address specific problems and avoid specific risks, and can help us think
    through appropriate responses to continually changing problems, good economics
    is never going to provide the apparently certain, simple and complete answers
    which the pre-crisis conventional wisdom appeared to. But that message is itself
    valuable, because it will guard against the danger that in the future, as in the
    recent past, we sweep aside common sense worries about emerging risks with assurances
    that a theory proves that everything is OK.'

    fractional reserve banks is so inherently unstable that we should abolish banks
    and instead extend credit to the economy via mutual loan funds, which are essentially
    banks with 100% equity capital requirements.8 For reasons I have set out elsewhere,
    I’m not convinced by that extremity of radicalism.9 ... But we do need to ensure
    that debates on capital and liquidity requirements address the fundamental issues
    rather than simply choices at the margin. And that requires
