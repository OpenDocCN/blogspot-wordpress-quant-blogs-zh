# VIX and More: Rohan Clarke on the VIX and Put to Call Ratios

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/12/rohan-clarke-on-vix-and-put-to-call.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/12/rohan-clarke-on-vix-and-put-to-call.html#0001-01-01)

With the favorable response I received on two recent posts, [Edward Hugh and a Fistful of Euros](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/11/edward-hugh-and-fistful-of-euros.html) and [Market Psych Offers Language-Based Fear Index](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/12/market-psych-offers-language-based-fear.html), I thought it might be a good time to highlight the work of another blogger who I believe deserves a wider audience and whose content nicely complements what readers can find here.

The blogger is Rohan Clarke and his blog is known as [Data Diary](http://www.datadiary.com.au/) and also carries the tag line, “An investor’s diary of economic data, corporate earnings and market sentiment.” While Clarke is based in Australia, his posts betray a broad range of geographical and intellectual interests. His latest missive, from earlier today, [Betting on Zero](http://www.datadiary.com.au/2010/12/15/betting-on-zero/), tackles inexpensive portfolio hedges, the VIX and [put to call](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/put%20to%20call) ratios.

For another insightful blog from Down Under, readers might also wish to check out [billy blog](http://bilbo.economicoutlook.net/blog/), where I can guarantee that Bill Mitchell’s take on the global economy and economic issues in Australia will give you something to think about, whether you agree with his perspective or not.
