    a bull market can last longer than any of us can reasonably expect – and then
    end more abruptly than even the most cautious bulls suspect. The St. Louis Fed
    Financial Stress Index is at its lowest ebb since they began calculating the index.
    How much lower can it realistically go? The answer is that no one really knows.

    about which you might answer positively, with a full-throated yes, in that regard.)

    may predict future financial instability and that policymakers should take this
    into account and respond to low risk premiums by adopting less accommodative monetary
    policy than would otherwise be justified by economic conditions. But before we
    conclude that the economic cost of a potentially sharp increase in bond risk premiums
    justifies less accommodative monetary policy, we should be certain that financial
    instability is in fact more likely to arise when bond risk premiums are low. ***This
    study casts doubt upon the hypothesis that low levels ******of bond risk premiums
    increase the likelihood of destabilizing sharp increases. To the contrary, the
    past 60 years of data suggest that large increases in bond risk premiums are independent
    of the recent level or change in risk premiums or the real federal funds rate.***

    to promote financial stability through adjustments in interest rates would increase
    the volatility of inflation and employment. As a result, ***I believe a macroprudential
    approach to supervision and regulation needs to play the primary role***. Such
    an approach should focus on "through the cycle" standards that increase the resilience
    of the financial system to adverse shocks and on efforts to ensure that the regulatory
    umbrella will cover previously uncovered systemically important institutions and
    activities. These efforts should be complemented by the use of countercyclical
    macroprudential tools, a few of which I will describe. But experience with such
    tools remains limited, and we have much to learn to use these measures effectively.'

    you move into a house filled with 19yr old derelict degenerates, there’s no going
    to sleep early.” But refusing to cut and run, he traded out of the position. “I
    figured if these morons were going to keep me up till 2am listening to Pearl Jam,
    they were going have to pay.” So he started a casino in the frat-house basement.
    That stank of stale beer and Skoal. But quickly overflowed with drunken gamblers,
    baseball caps turned backwards, drinking, dipping, crowded around blackjack tables.
    And indeed, they paid. Consistently. Reliably. He emerged from that basement stench
    to get his diploma. Tossed his cap. And headed to the ultimate casino. Wealthier.
    Wiser. “Built my entire business around buying carry, you’ll never meet someone
    who loves it more than me,” he said. I politely refused to take the other side.
    “So the fact that I can’t bring myself to buy this stuff anymore is very bad news
    for other guys.” But calling the end of a bull market is rather different from
    calling the beginning of a bear. The last great credit debacle in the US was the
    S+L crisis. Which was followed by an 8yr recovery. The 2008/09 crisis was far
    more severe and will be followed by a much longer, lackluster recovery. That’s
    how economies recover from financial crises – and we’re only 5yrs into this one.
    “We’re approaching an infection point, the past 5yrs have been fantastic for financial
    assets, for carry, but not great for the real economy, and that relationship is
    now in the process of reversing.” ***So he’s jumping on this credit cycle’s final
    trade. Buying every illiquid thing left, securitizing the crap, marking it up,
    creating new carry instruments. “To sell to some drunk idiots.”***
