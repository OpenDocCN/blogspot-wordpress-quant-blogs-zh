    Irish and Ghanaian parents who qualify too. Conversely, I know some mothers of
    Chinese heritage, almost always born in the West, who are not Chinese mothers,
    by choice or otherwise. I'm also using the term "Western parents" loosely. Western
    parents come in all varieties.

    rearing has been used since the days of Sparta. Hard effort, perseverance, duty,
    honor...and family - these are all attributes of the "Chinese" mother model advocated
    by Amy Chua.

    want to mold your child. During the 1980's, when Japan was ascendant, many analysts
    pointed to the rote learning and the discipline of the Japanese education system
    (which is similar in approach to the Chinese, Korean, etc.) What happened next?

    at spawning creativity. Consider how many Nobel Prizes have been won by Japanese
    scientists compared to westerners. (But then how many world leading pianists or
    Bill Gates does the world need?)

    and play dates. On the other hand, she plays the cello and the oboe, both of which
    aren't easy instruments. We optimize her activities to her strengths. She is a
    singer. She dance and acts, with the objective of the "triple threat" for musical
    theatre.

    right tools for her adult life, e.g. study skills. Performing arts isn't about
    making her a world famous child actor, but more about learning presentation and
    social skills - sort of a modern day finishing school.
