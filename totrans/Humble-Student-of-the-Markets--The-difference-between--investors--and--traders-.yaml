    which indicated that the macro backdrop was tilted bullishly. However, there was
    a small minority whose comments ran to the tone of the post being ridiculous advice.

    the community of traders. I would like to take this post to distinguish between
    my two personas, namely my inner trader and inner investor.

    many challenges, not the least of which are the wild daily and overnight swings
    in asset prices.

    more longer term view. The typical "investor" and can only check the market briefly
    during the day and only trades occasionally. They certainly do not have the time,
    resources or inclination to be fret over and trade swings in overnight stock index
    futures.

    investor hasn't really been hurt very much. That's because the bond market has
    acted as a very good diversifier, unlike 2008 when market contagion leaked into
    the credit markets.

    stocks and 40% bond allocation. He invests the stock portion into SPY and the
    bond portion into AGG. The simulation assumes that all income is re-invested back
    into the ETF of the respective asset classes (SPY dividends to SPY and AGG income
    into AGG). Once a year on December 31, he re-balances the portfolio back to the
    target 60-40 weight.

    September 2003, when the data series for AGG began. As of Tuesday, August 25,
    2015, the worst day of the stock market drawdown so far, the portfolio was underweight
    its stock benchmark by only 2.2%, which means that the bond market rallied enough
    to make up most of the losses suffered by equities. Contrast that with past experiences
    in 2008 when the equity weight cratered, or even the correction of 2011 when bond
    diversification had a less adequate effect.
