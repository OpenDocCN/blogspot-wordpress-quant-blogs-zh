    he said a two-speed Europe -- the euro zone moving ahead more rapidly than all
    27 countries in the EU -- was the only model for the future.

    to reinforce euro zone integration and could potentially open a window to make

    She had the story leaked to throw panic into the markets to pressure the German
    hardliners within her government and the Bundesbank. In that way, it would give
    her political cover to give Mario Draghi the nod to start monetizing debt.

    typical European fashion, there seems to be a lot going on behind the scenes with
    different factions of the elite jockeying for position. The good thing is that
    the Germans are actually having a hard internal debate of what they want out of
    the EU and the eurozone.
