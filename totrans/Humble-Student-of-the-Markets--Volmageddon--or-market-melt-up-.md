# Humble Student of the Markets: Volmageddon, or market melt-up?

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2020/08/volmageddon-or-market-melt-up.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2020/08/volmageddon-or-market-melt-up.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models**

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post,

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The

**Trend Asset Allocation Model**

is an asset allocation model which applies trend following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or contraction (bearish)?"

My inner trader uses a

**trading model**

, which is a blend of price momentum (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa). Subscribers receive real-time alerts of model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of the those email alerts are updated weekly

. The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that began in March 2016 is shown below.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Sell equities*
*   Trend Model signal: Neutral*
*   Trading model: Bullish*

**An unusual correlation**

An unusual condition has occurred in the last week, as both stock prices and the VIX Index have been rising together. The VIX has been making a saucer bottom, which could be setting up for a volatility surge, and lower stock prices. While past episodes of high correlation have resolved in short or medium term pullbacks, there have been other occasions, such as late 2017, when these signals marked market melt-ups.

Are we poised for a Volmageddon, or a market melt-up?
