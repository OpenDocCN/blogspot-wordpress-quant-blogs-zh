# Pre-Flight Java Coding – Clone() | Tales from a Trading Desk

## Pre-Flight Java Coding – Clone()

So after a very minor break, its back to the airport cycle of work life, which in itself bring a degree of fun and games 😉  Before flights, I like to ensure I’ve got enough reading and coding material.  Hence today, its a bit of pre-coding to ensure I’m ready for tonight’s flight, and a re-cap to the coding challenge I was working on a few weeks ago.  Very quickly this morning I ran into the classic clone() [method](http://javanirvana.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/why-clone-method-is-protected.html) [madness](http://howtodoinjava.com/2012/11/08/a-guide-to-object-cloning-in-java/) of Java.

> Citation From **Josh Bloch’s Effective Java**:
> *“The Cloneable interface was intended as a mixin interface for objects to advertise that they permit cloning. Unfortunately it fails to serve this purpose … This is a highly atypical use of interfaces and not one to be emulated … In order for implementing the interface to have any effect on a class, it and all of its superclasses must obey a **fairly complex, unenforceable and largely undocumented protocol***

So with a sensible(ish) clone method written, I’m ready for a bit of reactive coding tonight, which if I have time will also incur some DAG work on the server.
