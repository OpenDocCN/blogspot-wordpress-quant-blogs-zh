    has only just decided to create a Financial Services Unit. It‚Äôs common knowledge
    that JPMC has been using Platform for years, and has essentially helped tune Platform‚Äôs
    thoughts on Financial Services usage. So why has it taken so long to create the
    unit? Has the credit-crunch in 2008 offered Platform an opportunity to expand
    into other banks and displace DataSynapse?

    [Healthcare](http://blogs.msdn.com/martharotter/archive/2008/05/08/new-shiny-silverlight-2-healthcare-demo.aspx)
    demo. I agree its a cool demo (shame its not FS centric üôÇ ), however until we
    get close to Silverlight 2.0 RTM and begin to see what performance Microsoft can
    actually achieve in the browser, we in a similar place to early WPF ‚Äì cool stuff,
    but the performance is ‚Ä¶. With the Silverlight push well underway, its nice to
    see Microsoft facing off Flex in the game authoring arena ‚Äì Silverlight Popfly
