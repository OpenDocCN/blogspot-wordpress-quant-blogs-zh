- en: In [Fear Index Now Inverse to VIX](http://www.zerohedge.com/article/fear-index-now-inverse-vix),
    Zero Hedge recently put forth the idea that the VIX is “being gamed by volatility
    sellers” and may be “the most behind the scenes manipulated index.”

- en: Several readers have asked me to comment on this. In short, I do not believe
    the VIX is being gamed to any significant extent. Among the volatility data I
    watch are the correlations across the various major volatility indices, including
    the VIX, [VXN](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXN) (for the NASDAQ-100),
    [RVX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/RVX) (for the Russell 2000),
    [VXO](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXO) (for the S&P 100 index)
    and [VXD](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXD) (for the Dow Jones
    Industrial Average.) Historically, the lowest of these correlations has been the
    two market cap extremes, a 97% correlation between the RVX and the VXO. Frankly,
    I have not seen much of a deviation from historical patterns over the course of
    the past few weeks. The charts below show all five volatility indices over the
    course of the past one month (top) and three months (bottom). If there is any
    evidence to support the VIX as deviating from the other volatility indices, I
    don’t see it.

- en: Note that because the VXO does not have any options or futures associated with
    it, gaming that volatility index would likely be the most difficult and expensive
    of the group. Also consider that because the components of the VXO have the largest
    market caps of any of the volatility indices, one would expect changes in the
    VXO to be less dramatic than those of the other indices that are populated by
    smaller and more volatile companies.
