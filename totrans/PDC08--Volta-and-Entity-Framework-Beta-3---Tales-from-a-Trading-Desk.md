> Êù•Ê∫êÔºö[https://mdavey.wordpress.com/2007/12/06/pdc08-volta-and-entity-framework-beta-3/#0001-01-01](https://mdavey.wordpress.com/2007/12/06/pdc08-volta-and-entity-framework-beta-3/#0001-01-01)

## PDC08, Volta and Entity Framework Beta¬†3

It comes as no real surprise that [PDC08](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-gb/events/bb288534.aspx) is going to happen ‚Äì with PDC07 cancelled, and .NET Framework ‚Äú4‚Äù announced as part of Oslo a PDC was needed.

[Volta](http://blogs.msdn.com/wesdyer/archive/2007/12/06/volta-and-you.aspx) is [available](http://labs.live.com/volta/) in the Microsoft Live labs. [Video](http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=324060#324060) here together with [pdf](http://research.microsoft.com/~emeijer/Papers/DemocratizingTheCloudOOPSLA2007.pdf).

I know a few colleague will be happy about the [Entity Framework Beta 3](http://blogs.msdn.com/adonet/archive/2007/12/05/ado-net-entity-framework-beta-3-rleased.aspx) release üôÇ ‚Äì they can finally move to VS 2008 RTM
