- en: Portfolio A1 rallied vigorously last week and now leads the benchmark SPX by
    1.7%.  Four of the five holdings (all but NTY) are within 3% of their 52 week
    highs, with <state st="on"><place st="on">TEX</place></state> logging a new all-time
    high on Friday.

    strongly resemble a [duck](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/03/canary-or-canard_09.html),
    although as portfolio performance improves I am ever hopeful that we can fly out

    the top 5,000 at the [CNBC Million Dollar Portfolio Challenge](http://contests.cnbc.com/milliondollar/contestmain.do).
    I am currently in the top 2% of all contestants for this challenge, using a discretionary
    trading system that has recently made strong gains in natural gas and copper.
    My goal is to be comfortably in the top 1% and taking a run at the money when
    the contest ends on May 14\. I will pass along any news of interest as it develops.)
