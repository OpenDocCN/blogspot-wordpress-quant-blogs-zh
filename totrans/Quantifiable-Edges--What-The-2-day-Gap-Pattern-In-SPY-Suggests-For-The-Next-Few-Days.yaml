- en: Unfilled gaps can be a signal of strength in the direction of the gap.  But
    when they are quickly reversed by a sign of weakness that can suggest the first
    move was false.  Friday's unfilled gap up in SPY was a sign of strength.  Monday's
    unfilled gap down was a sign of weakness.  This suggests Friday's move was false.
     Unfilled gaps down that directly follow unfilled gaps up have historically led
    to further short-term weakness.  This can be seen in the study below.

    Wednesday's Fed Day, and European news flows there are a lot of outside forces
    that could impact the market over the next few days.  But the action over the
    last 2 days will likely weigh on the market.
