# Magmasystems Blog: Two New User Groups on LinkedIn

> 来源：[http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2009/05/two-new-user-groups-on-linkedin.html#0001-01-01](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2009/05/two-new-user-groups-on-linkedin.html#0001-01-01)

I just created two new User Groups on LinkedIn.

1)

[Microsoft Complex Event Processing](http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=1990928)

This is for discussions surrounding the new Microsoft CEP (aka Orinoco) product.

2)

[Aleri](http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=1990926)

This is for the newly combined CorAleri product. We can discuss the legacy Coral8 and Aleri products, and discuss the parts of the CorAleri roadmap that are not under NDA.

If these groups interest you, please feel free to join.
