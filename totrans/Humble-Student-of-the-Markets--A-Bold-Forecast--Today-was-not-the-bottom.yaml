    the Dow cratered over 400 points, but closed the day down only 173, or 1%.

    bottom. As the chart below shows, two of my trifecta of bottom spotting indicators
    are flashing oversold signals (see  the discussion in

    was approximately the same level as the open. Such Japanese candlestick formations
    are often indications of market indecision and can mark reversals. Moreover, the
    pattern where the market trades falls at the open and rallies near the end of
    the day to close at or near the high is also a sign of bearish exhaustion - another
    bullish sign.

    Wednesday, October 15, 2014, was not the bottom of the market decline. While the
    market is very oversold and we are likely to see a market bottom within days,
    the bulls will have to be prepared for more pain in the near future.

    bottom. Consider this chart below of the relative performance of the different
    major sectors against SPY for the day. If I told you that the market action in
    a day was marked by downside leadership was in Financials and Utilities,  and
    traditional high octane sectors and groups, like small and mid caps and NASDAQ,
    outperformed, would you expect to see a day where the major averages were down
    over 2% at the worst points of the day? These are not the normal signs of a panic
    capitulation sell-off.

    200 dma without even a pause, we can definitely conclude that we are not in the
    steady uptrending market of the past two years. Perhaps better analogues of the
    current market weakness can be found in the pre-2012 period, in the market sell-offs
    of 2010 and 2011.

    episodes of that time. As the chart below of 2010 shows, notwithstanding the unusual
    Flash Crash, there were two instances circled in red of dojis or hammers, where
    the market fell at the open but rallied to close above the open. Neither case
    marked the bottom of the decline.

    the bottom of the decline.

    that the kind of market action we saw today, especially with the unusual nature
    of the leadership, do not indicate that the stock market bottomed today. For a
    true capitulation bottom, we may need to see a "margin clerk" market, where everything
    goes down on high volume, all sectors including gold, and correlations converge
    to 1.

    be painful and the doctor tells you, "You're going feel a bit of a pinch"? I am
    afraid that's what going to happen to the bulls for the next few days.
