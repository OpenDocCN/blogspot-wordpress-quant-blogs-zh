    most of whom are in the brokerage community, who believe that the investment management
    process is straightforward. You just need to pick the right things: the right
    stocks, the right sectors, countries, themes, etc. The rest is just the “messy”

    example of this would be an index fund. If it's an active mandate and the client
    has already done a lot of work, this may be a highly customized benchmark.

    plan or deferred compensation plan of a small group of executives in a company.
    Ideally, you should build some sort of timing model to understand when the asset
    class or your selection process gets into trouble and minimize risk during those
    environments. If you don’t have a timing model, figure out how much tolerance
    for loss the client has and then position your benchmark between cash and the
    market. Translate your risk tolerance estimate into weights of the relative importance
    of these two components.

- en: The answer (3) is very typical of an institutional mandate. It is a sad truth
    in life but in general, only top-quartile managers get new assets and bottom-quartile
    get dropped. As an example of the importance of the competitor positions, during
    the 1990s most international equity managers were vastly underweight Japan compared
    to the EAFE index. As a result most managers handily outperformed the stated benchmark
    of EAFE as Japan had been a laggard during that period. It was therefore important
    to know the median manager weight in Japan was during that period for EAFE-mandate
    managers.

    managers in his asset class, and estimated these competitors’ exposures. He then
    pegged the benchmark and portfolio to the average macro exposure of these two
    competitors (see the sidebar entitled *Reverse Engineering a Manager's Macro Exposure*
    for an example of how to estimate competitor position weights).
