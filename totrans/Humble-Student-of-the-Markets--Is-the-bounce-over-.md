# Humble Student of the Markets: Is the bounce over?

**Mid-week market update**

: One of the concerns I had after last Friday's market turnaround was that a bounce had become the consensus view. Virtually every technical analyst was calling for a bear market rally, followed by further weakness. It sounded too easy. Either the bounce was going to fail, or the market was going to roar to new highs.

The market followed through Friday's strength with a 2% gain in the S&P 500 yesterday (Tuesday), but managed to give it all back and more today. The hourly S&P 500 chart exhibited a possible upside breakout through an inverse head and shoulders pattern, which was thwarted by today's weakness. While there is nothing worse than a failed breakout, it could be argued that the market is in the process of forming the last shoulder of the formation. 

In light of today's market action, is the bounce over?
