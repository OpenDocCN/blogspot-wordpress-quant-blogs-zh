    Psychology took a look at which disciplines children and adults thought were the
    most difficult to learn. For the most part, people of all ages think psychology
    is easy and physics is hard. That bias begins early and changes some, but not
    much, the older we get.

    that what we consider hard, like chess and multiplication, is easy for a computer.
    What we consider easy--like recognizing emotions on faces, or visually distinguishing
    between a dog and a cat--a computer finds quite difficult. What is hard for us,
    is only because we know the right answer, and know how difficult it is to do the
    logic in our head. Most thoughts we take for granted are really quite complex,
    yet because we can't even begin to write down how we do it, we do not realize
    it.

    our progress has been much slower here than in these areas. An educated man knows
    a lot more math or physics than a child or hunter-gatherer; he does not know much
    more about what causes business cycles. Figuring out why Haiti is so poor, or
    how interest rates affect investment, is really difficult. However, it is easy
    for someone to articulate an answer to hard social issues that is not obviously
    wrong, which makes it easy to think one knows the answer. A wrong math or physics
    answer, is clearly wrong, and if you have worked with people who knows something
    quantitative you learn quite quickly how ignorant you are in that area.

    generally means you just don't know what you don't know.
