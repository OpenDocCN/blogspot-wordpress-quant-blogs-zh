> 来源：[https://quantivity.wordpress.com/2010/01/12/how-to-learn-algorithmic-trading-part-3/#0001-01-01](https://quantivity.wordpress.com/2010/01/12/how-to-learn-algorithmic-trading-part-3/#0001-01-01)

Third in a series on learning quantitative / algorithmic trading, this post focuses on financial modeling and analysis, assuming understanding of financial mathematics from [Part 2](https://quantivity.wordpress.com/2010/01/12/how-to-learn-algorithmic-trading-part-2/) and overview of quantitative trading from [Part 1](https://quantivity.wordpress.com/2010/01/10/how-to-learn-algorithmic-trading/). After digesting these, readers should be capable of both building interesting systematic trading systems and understanding microstructure dynamics that drive modern market making (sell side) and large block trading (buy side).

Thanks to [awwthor](http://awwthor.wordpress.com/), quant.this, [Josh Ulrich](http://blog.fosstrading.com/), [Gappy](http://www.twitter.com/gappy3000), and Bjørn for their comments and recommendations on the original post. As with the preceding two posts, the following is intended to inform *retail quantitative trading with a bias to equity, exchange-traded derivatives, and FX*.

Begin with standard introductory financial time series asset dynamics, volatility, and forecast modeling:

*   Analysis of Financial Time Series, by Tsay: standard applied time series text for financial econometrics
*   Market Models: A Guide to Financial Data Analysis, by Alexander: excellent introduction to financial modeling and forecast
*   Asset Price Dynamics, Volatility, and Prediction, by Taylor: classic text on financial modeling and forecast

Proceed to modern portfolio theory and financial engineering:

*   Modern Portfolio Theory and Investment Analysis, by Elton *et al.*: standard text on modern portfolio theory
*   Options, Futures and Other Derivatives, by Hull: standard reference for introductory financial engineering
*   Active Portfolio Management, by Grinold & Kahn: standard introduction to quantitative portfolio management by the BGI guys who invented it
*   Principles of Financial Engineering, by Neftci: intermediate financial engineering

Continue on to volatility for options and correlation / dispersion for arb:

*   Volatility and Correlation, by Rebonato: excellent coverage of volatility and correlation
*   Volatility Trading, by Sinclair: volatility arbitrage by a retail practitioner
*   Volatility Surface, by Gatheral: theoretical coverage of vol models, by well-known researcher
*   Options as a Strategic Investment, by McMillan: classic introductory text on derivative hedging and volatility trading
*   Option Volatility & Pricing, by Natenberg: dated practitioner introduction to volatility trading

Finally, delve into high-frequency & market microstructure to enjoy foundations of modern buy and sell sides:

*   Trading and Exchanges: Market Microstructure for Practitioners, by Harris: practitioner introduction to stylized financial microstructure effects
*   An Introduction to High-Frequency Finance, by Dacorogna *et al.*: theoretical and dated practitioner introduction to HF, with emphasis on FX
*   Empirical Market Microstructure, by Hasbrouck: intermediate equity market microstructure, with coverage of standard theoretical models
*   Microstructure Approach to Exchange Rates, by Lyons: intermediate FX market microstructure, covering both theory and empirical models (bit dated)
*   Market Microstructure Theory, by O’Hara: classic introduction to microstructure theory; now dated
*   Optimal Trading Strategies, by Kissell and Glantz: practitioner introduction to market impact and optimal execution

From here, readers can happily delve into the journal literature.
