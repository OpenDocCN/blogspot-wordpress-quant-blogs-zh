# Magmasystems Blog: The First Annual Fluffies for CEP

> 来源：[http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2008/07/first-annual-fluffies-for-cep.html#0001-01-01](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2008/07/first-annual-fluffies-for-cep.html#0001-01-01)

Tim Bass wrote an excellent post the other day in which he questioned the categorization process around “Streaming Databases” and “Complex Event Processing” products.

Tim’s post inspired me to write something that I have been meaning to write for a very long time. This has to do with how some

CEP

products have won "Fluff" awards over the past few years.

In this (

[http://www.coral8.com/news/pr/145.html](http://www.coral8.com/news/pr/145.html)

) press release, Coral8 announced that they have won the 2007 Jolt Award. According to the press release,

*“The Coral8 Engine was selected from among 26 product nominations in the Database Engines and Data Tools category by a **renowned team of judges** that select Jolt award winners based on how nominees have made it faster and easier to create data-centric applications.”*

In this (

[http://www.aleri.com/news/press-releases/details/?pressID=32](http://www.aleri.com/news/press-releases/details/?pressID=32)

) press release,

Aleri

trots out the fact that they won the 2008 Jolt Award, which I assume tells people that

Aleri

is now better than the 2007 Jolt winner.

*“Being recognized by Jolt’s **renowned panel of judges** consisting of industry insiders, columnist, and technology leaders demonstrates the impact that our complex event processing software has had on the industry,” said Don DeLoach, CEO of Aleri.* 

Both

Aleri

and Coral8 were graded by a

***“renowned panel of judges”***

. I guess that Terry and Don both drank the Jolt

Kool

-Aid (sic) that day :-)

Another award that was just won by Coral8 was from Windows in Financial Services magazine, which is a free magazine given out to people in the financial community. This magazine has absolutely no technical content, and reads like one large advertisement for Microsoft.

*“Coral8 was a clear choice for the 2008 WFS Innovator Award because of their demonstrated leadership in providing solutions that deliver results,” said Windows in Financial Services publisher Joe Viviani. “We evaluated companies of all sizes and the companies selected delivered ground-breaking applications and platforms that better serve the securities industry.”* 

Who did the judging for this award? What were the criteria? It was interesting to see that Coral8 was the only

CEP

vendor that was showing off their wares at the Microsoft booth at

SIFMA

. Did

WFS

magazine happen to consider

Apama

? How about

Streambase

? (Oops … sorry

WFS

readers ...

Streambase

is written in Java)

Just who are these judges? According to Don, they are columnists and technology leaders. Wow! With respect to my journalistic colleagues like Greg

McSweeny

, when was the last time a columnist cracked open Coral8, wrote some

CCL

, and forced market data feeds into the pipe. Have any of these “technology leaders” taken

Aleri

and built and end-to-end application with it? Most of the columnists I know have trouble understanding the things that they write about.

What were the criteria that these renowned judges used to benchmark the systems? They should let us know, because this might mean that we don’t need the

Stac

Council anymore. The

CEP

working group of the

Stac

Council spends a few hours a few trying to work out comprehensive and objective testing specs for

CEP

products. The

Stac

Council is comprised of the chief architects of most of the

CEP

vendors, plus several customers from Capital Markets firms.

I can imagine the reaction of people like Jon/Jack/Scott from

Aleri

, Mark/Bob from Coral8, and Thomas from

Esper

when they read about these Jolt awards. These people have worked hard to provide compelling architectures, and awards like these Jolt Awards tend to marginalize their work.

I am not picking on Coral8 and

Aleri

here. I love both companies, and both have great products, great technical staffs, and CEO’s who are passionate about their products. What I find disturbing is the fact that they are giving credence to awards that, to me, seem like pure fluff. I talk to my colleagues at our competitors about their evaluation processes, and believe me when I tell you that the Jolt or

WFS

awards have zero impact on our evaluation process. These awards also marginalize the hard work of

Stac

to provide real benchmarks that companies can use when evaluating these products.

Awards are fine when the judging process is transparent to all. Until then,

CEP

vendors should not insult their customers by crowing about fluff. It works to your

detriment

rather than to your advantage.
