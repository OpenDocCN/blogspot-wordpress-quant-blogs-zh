# VIX and More: TVIX Topples VXX as Highest Volume VIX ETP

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2012/02/tvix-topples-vxx-as-highest-volume-vix.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2012/02/tvix-topples-vxx-as-highest-volume-vix.html#0001-01-01)

With just a few minutes before the close, it is now almost certain that [TVIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TVIX) (VelocityShares Daily 2x VIX Short-Term ETN) is going to dethrone [VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX) as the most heavily traded [VIX exchange-traded product](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20ETN) (ETP), with TVIX trading 29 million shares and VXX at 25 million.

VXX, which [just celebrated its third birthday](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2012/01/vxx-celebrates-third-birthday.html) at the end of January has reigned supreme in volume and assets since the first week it was launched. TVIX has a long way to go before it matches VXX in terms of assets, but the gap is narrowing quickly.

Based on some questions I have received from retail investors, it seems as if many who are new to the TVIX party do not understand the nuances or even the basics of this product – so it looks like another round of education is in order.

For the record, not only has TVIX dethroned VXX, but VelocityShares has also overtaken Barclays/iPath as the #1 provider of VIX-based ETPs in terms of volume. It will be interesting to see how Barclays addresses this in terms of future products.
