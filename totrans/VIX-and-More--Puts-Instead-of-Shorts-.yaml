    Exchange](http://www.ise.com/) ([ISE](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/ISE))
    during the first two hours of today’s trading. Keep in mind that the ISEE is a
    “call to put” ratio, not the “[put to call](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/put%20to%20call)”
    ratio reported by the CBOE.

- en: As reflected in the table, right out of the gate there was a flood of calls
    for indices, ETFs, and individual stocks. Note that in the last hour or so, the
    activity has tilted heavily toward the put end of the spectrum, as the call to
    put ratios have dropped dramatically. It is difficult to differentiate between
    hedging and speculation in these transactions, but now that options spreads seem
    to be tightening and implied volatility is dropping sharply, I suspect those looking
    to get [short](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/short%20selling) financials
    and any other part of the market may be leaning toward puts.

    shorting regulations.
