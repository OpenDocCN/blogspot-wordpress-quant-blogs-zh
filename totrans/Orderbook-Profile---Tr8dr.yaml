- en: I haven’t posted for quite a while as have been busy getting a new high-frequency
    venture off the ground.   We started trading 2 weeks ago so will start posting
    periodically again.

- en: There is some modeling crossover between the medium-daily frequency to high-frequency
    space, but of course each of these areas has their own characteristics.

- en: The highest profit-per-trade strategies focus on short-term cross-asset relationships,
    MR, and long-run mean prediction.   These strategies have holding periods in minutes,
    anywhere from 5-20 minutes generally.  That said, there is a whole world of opportunity
    at the higher frequencies.    In some cases the profit after transaction cost
    may only be a couple 10ths of a basis point, but with a very high win/loss ratio.

- en: For some of the simpler HF strategies, interpreting the order book and the flows
    in and out are key.   Here is a sample order book profile showing the longevity
    of orders in the book versus initial positioning relative to the inside price
    (as-of just before placement).  +pips are outside of the inside price and -pips
    are better than inside (i.e. better than best bid or ask as appropriate).

    to inside + 3 pips.   More interesting is to look at the higher frequency activity
    in a subset of this:'

- en: We can use this to see where most of the activity is occurring.   With a bit
    more analysis get an idea of what other algorithms are doing and their frequency
    in the market.    Seeing how this changes with market time and regime is also
    telling..

- en: In the above density graph it is easy to see that +5/10ths pip is a popular
    target for HF algorithms in this sample, for order durations 1ms and larger.  There
    is also something interesting going on with orders < 1ms (basically a place followed
    closely by a cancel).   One can then trace through order streams against targets
    like these and get a view on other games in town.
