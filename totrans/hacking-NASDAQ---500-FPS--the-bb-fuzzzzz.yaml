    kinda cool but how does that translate to bids/offers/price/blah? the answer...
    it depends but does give an general feel for how fast the market moves.

    axis is change in best bid, vertical axis is time since midnight in nanosecconds

- en: Its kind of interesting as can see the general shape of the level ticks, the
    constant fuzzz on the best bid. Probably the most interesting thing at this level
    is the clearly visible steps and curve of the cumulative time. With the pre open
    step, few steps towards market open, the long flat string of activity at the open
    then slowing down during the middle, where as you can see the slight curve near
    the end. What i find interesting is the bursting near the close is quite different
    than the open - seems theres less changes in the best bid/offer but needs further
    investigation.

    algos at play,, how fascinating! Lets zoom in on some fuzzzzzzz

- en: where can see the fuzz in the middle has new price levels every ~50usec (vertical
    axis is in nanoseconds), which is pretty dam quick. Remember these are *new* best
    bid on the horizontal axis and not the raw ticks. e.g. when a new better price
    level is seen, or an existing price level is destroyed.

- en: So whats the fuzz doing? either generating noise on the best bid/offer in an
    attempt to fool other algos theres a new price level? possibly. Or could be the
    famous iceburg/pegged orders where you only display a fraction of shares, then
    replenish the bid/offer when someone grabs em. My guess is the latter here, easy
    test is add executed quantity but..fun for some other  day.
