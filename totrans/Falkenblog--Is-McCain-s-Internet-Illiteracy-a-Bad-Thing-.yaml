- en: distributions are presumed perfect by people who use them, many people learn
    just enough to make them dangerous. The most common statistical vice is judging
    models primarily by their R2's, and those are people who know a little, but only
    a little, about econometrics. Or people who apply a train-test-validate approach,
    repeatedly, find the highest 'validation' result and think it was all 'out of
    sample.' MBAs learn that beta is a measure of risk, and returns are a linear function
    of beta. They are sheep to be shorn. I think I didn't really understand statistics
    until I TA'd for the course three times.

    Ideally, a decider knows a lot. But choosing between a decider who know's nothing
    and a little on a subject? I think I'd take the complete ignoramus, he would be
    more cautious.
