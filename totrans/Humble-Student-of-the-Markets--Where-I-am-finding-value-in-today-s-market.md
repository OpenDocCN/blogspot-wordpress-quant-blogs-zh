# Humble Student of the Markets: Where I am finding value in today`s market

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2016/03/where-i-am-finding-value-in-todays.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2016/03/where-i-am-finding-value-in-todays.html#0001-01-01)

I was playing around with

[Relative Rotation Graphs](https://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:chart_analysis:rrg_charts)

 (RRG) on the weekend with a focus on changes in sector leadership (see my previous post

[RIP Recession. Reflationary resurrection next?](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/03/06/rip-correction-reflationary-resurrection-next/)

). RRG charts measure how a stock or sector is performing relative to a benchmark on a short and long term basis as a way of better understanding the evolution of market leadership. An idealized rotation cycle would see a stock or sector rotate in a clockwise fashion starting at the lower right quadrant (weakening) to the lower left (lagging) to upper left (improving) and to the top right (leading).

When I turned the lens from sector leadership to market styles, or factors, I got a big surprise.

I am reminded of a variation on an old adage:
