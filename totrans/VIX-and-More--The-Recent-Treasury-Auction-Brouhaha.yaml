    my intent was to provide some background information on [Treasury auctions](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Treasury%20Auctions)
    that might be appropriate to get an equity-centric investor up to speed on the
    basics.

    as consisting entirely of stocks, but if we have learned anything in the past
    year, it is that erecting artificial boundaries to one’s investment knowledge
    dramatically increases the risk of getting blindsided in any asset class.

    of a number of readers, let me turn to some interesting recent developments that
    have created quite a stir in the bond circles.

    of the financial crisis. One of the early flash points was the deterioration and
    eventual government bailout of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. At that time, approximately
    10% of China’s GDP was invested in bonds issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,
    which was probably the reason why Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson felt the need
    to explain:'

    system that a failure of either of them would cause great turmoil in our financial
    markets here at home **and around the globe**.* [emphasis added]”

    Treasury debt held by foreign nations. Since the beginning of the financial crisis,
    there have been rumblings that interest in U.S. debt may be waning in the Treasury’s
    two largest customers – an issue that was summarized nicely by Keith Bradsher
    of the New York Times at the beginning of the year in [China Losing Taste for
    Debt from U.S.](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/08/business/worldbusiness/08yuan.html)
    The most recent data available show that China, the largest customer of U.S. Treasury
    securities, reduced its holdings from $801.5 in May to $776.4 in June.'

    in which it reports data from indirect bidders on June 1^(st). In [Is Foreign
    Demand as Solid as It Looks?](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124588934703850877.html#articleTabs%3Darticle)
    Min Zeng of the Wall Street Journal claimed that the new reporting standards which
    expanded the definition of indirect bidders made it more difficult to determine
    the level of foreign demand.

    comes from Chris Martenson, whose [The Shell Game – How the Federal Reserve Is
    Monetizing Debt](http://www.chrismartenson.com/blog/shell-game-how-federal-reserve-monetizing-debt/25806)
    makes the case that the Federal Reserve is using a custody account to enable foreign
    central banks to swap agency debt for Treasury debt. If this turns out to be the
    true, it will undoubtedly have some very interesting implications.
