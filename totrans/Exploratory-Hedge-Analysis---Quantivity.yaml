    analysis in finance—as the fine texture of the real world differs from both mathematical
    formalisms and standard mental models. Indeed, alpha hides in the *divergence*
    between model and reality.

    ample returns well outside the dispersion ellipsoids, consistent with previous
    posts. Bottom left plot illustrates returns split by sign, demonstrating divergence
    in fit between positive and non-negative returns. Bottom right plot illustrates
    divergence between returns under and over 0.5 standard deviations, whose fit is
    quite similar.

    with CRM return tails going out to +/- 10%. Cross correlation in top right plot
    exemplifies both forward and backward linear dependence for absolute returns,
    consistent with previous post on autocopulas. Difference ratios in bottom left
    plot illustrate empirical beta ranges from 1 to *several hundred*, irrespective
    whether returns are measured daily, weekly, or monthly—*this corroborates difficulty
    of proxy hedging with linear instruments*. These ratios provide the first evidence
    that late-2010 was perhaps even more anomalous for this pair than 2008, which
    is quite remarkable. Finally, bottom right plot illustrating return ROC further
    juxtaposes the comparison, as the ROC of both CRM and QQQ was dramatically higher
    in 2008 than 2010.

    (VR) for all roll durations are maximized over the 12 months beginning in August
    2010\. Contrast those ratios with the *nearly flat VR, at all durations, during
    the financial crisis*. The bottom plot provides one dimension of insight into
    this comparative behavior, illustrating that proxy correlation behaved inversely
    during these two periods: correlation was maximized during the finance crisis
    and minimized during 2010/2011.'

    correlation exhibits *monotonic smoothing* as lag window increases (conceptually
    similar to low-pass filtering), as exemplified by correlation progressive decreasing
    with black (daily), red (bi-weekly), blue (monthly), and green (quarterly). In
    contrast, the roll variance ratio exhibits no such scaling (monotonic or not).
    For example, early 2007 exhibits 60-day VR *exceedingly* all period periods. Similarly,
    the monthly VR frequently exceeds the biweekly VR.'
