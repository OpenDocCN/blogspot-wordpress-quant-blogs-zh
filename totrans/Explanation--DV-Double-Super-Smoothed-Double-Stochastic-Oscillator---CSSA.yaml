    I try to avoid getting too technical most of the time, and spare readers the dry
    explanations for my indicator refinements, but in this case things are simpler
    to appreciate. The stochastic in its typical form is not per se an overbought/oversold
    oscillator because it in fact is just a simple measure of where the current price
    is relative to its highs measured in terms of the length of the stochastic–which
    in this case is 10 days. Most traders are aware that stochastics–unlike RSI and
    other oscillators—spend most of their time at peaks and valleys. Additionally,
    stochastics tend to completely top or bottom out as new price highs and lows are
    made even in quiet conditions. This makes it difficult to 1) differentiate trend
    from exhaustion points and 2) know when to use a signal.

    where the current stochastic reading is in relation to the past. Thus the double
    stochastic is now a de-trended oscillator which now mainly takes into account
    the cyclicality of price movement for the underlying stock or index. For example,
    if the 1st stochastic rarely went below 50, then the double stochastic would convert
    50 to a value close to zero to account for the fact that this is a relative low.
    The same thing applies with persistently high numbers. The additional smoothing
    also helps to slow down the signals and reduce error. The resulting indicator
    looks almost like a sine wave, which is exactly what it is supposed to do. Using
    further technical refinements and more complex math, one can actually derive a
    lot of information about cycles and create price projections using the double
    stochastic. But that is beyond the scope of this article.
