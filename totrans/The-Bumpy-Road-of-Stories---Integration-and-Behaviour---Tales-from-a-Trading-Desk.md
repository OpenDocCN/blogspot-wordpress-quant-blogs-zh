## The Bumpy Road of Stories – Integration and Behaviour

Many teams at some point down the agile bumpy road of retrospectives have encountered some of the following experiences:

*   Ill formed stories due to lack of understand what a story is
*   Confusion over story vs. epic
*   Believing a tool will provide the agility to a team over core agile practices
*   Writing technical stories, and realises no real business ROI is delivered
*   Writing stories with no acceptance critieria
*   Writing stories that are UX/UI bias

As some point most applications have to interface to other systems – up or down stream.  This leads nicely into the next set of problems teams often encounter:

*   Technical stories re-appear
*   Realisation that the original stories were to UX/UI bias
*   Acceptance criteria lacked full end to end coverage

This leads to a nice “old” posting from Mountain Goat, on writing back-end system [stories](http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/writing-user-stories-for-back-end-systems) – “As a bank”.  Which brings us nicely back to the age old What’s in a [Story](http://dannorth.net/whats-in-a-story/)?

> *It starts at the outside by identifying business outcomes, and then drills down into the feature set that will achieve those outcomes. Each feature is captured as a “story”, which defines the scope of the feature along with its acceptance criteria*
