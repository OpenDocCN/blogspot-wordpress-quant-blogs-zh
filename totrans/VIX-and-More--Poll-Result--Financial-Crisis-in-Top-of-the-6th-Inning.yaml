    in the first ever VIX and More poll, which asked readers, “What inning is it for
    the financial crisis?”'

- en: The results of the poll are shown at the right. The median response puts the
    crisis in the early part of the sixth inning; the mean response has it split between
    the fifth and sixth inning; and the most common response was the seventh inning.

    in the financial crisis did not change at all following Thursday’s rumors and
    Friday’s announcement concerning the [Troubled Asset Relief Program](http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2008/09/paulson-transcript-troubled-asset.html)
    or TARP.

    and will consider resurrecting this feature periodically in order to get a better
    sense of what the blog's readership is thinking about important issues.
