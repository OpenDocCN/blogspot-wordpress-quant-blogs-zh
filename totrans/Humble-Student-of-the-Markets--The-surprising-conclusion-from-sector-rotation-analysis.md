# Humble Student of the Markets: The surprising conclusion from sector rotation analysis

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2018/07/the-surprising-conclusion-from-sector.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2018/07/the-surprising-conclusion-from-sector.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models**

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post,

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The

**Trend Model**

is an asset allocation model which applies trend following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or contraction (bearish)?"

My inner trader uses the trading component of the Trend Model to look for changes in the direction of the main Trend Model signal. A bullish Trend Model signal that gets less bullish is a trading "sell" signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading "buy" signal. The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. The turnover rate of the trading model is high, and it has varied between 150% to 200% per month.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Buy equities*
*   Trend Model signal: Neutral*
*   Trading model: Bullish*

**What sector will lead?**

The bulls appear to have taken control of the tape. The SPX is exhibiting a bullish cup and saucer formation. If it achieves a decisive breakout at 2800, the upside target is about 2950*. In all likelihood, the upside breakout will occur, as there is strong breadth support as small cap, midcap, and NASDAQ indices all achieved all-time highs last week.

As US stock prices are poised for fresh highs, one of the key questions is the nature of the leadership that investors should expect. A standard approach of using Relative Rotation Graph charting yielded some answers, but a further factor-based analysis indicated a surprising level of risk exposure.

*I had previously published an upside target of 3050 in a past versions of the cup and handle analysis. The 3050 figure was a arithmetic error. My apologies for the mistake.*
