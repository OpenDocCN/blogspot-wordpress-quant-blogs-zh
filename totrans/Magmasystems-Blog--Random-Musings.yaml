- en: Coral8 just released version 5.3\. We asked them for a KDB+ adapter, and they
    delivered. It was our opinion that KDB+ is used so frequently in capital markets
    firms that it made perfect sense that the coral8 developer should be able to read
    data from KDB as easily as they can read data from Oracle or SQL Server. Right
    now, you still need to write Q queries in Coral8's KDB adapter in order to fetch
    data from KDB+ .... I was hoping for a way that a developer can write a simple
    SQL statement and have the KDB adapter translate the query into Q, but that will
    have to wait for a future version. We ask them to write this stuff and make it
    available in their core product in the hopes that a lot of people use it, debug
    it, and ask Coral8 for more enhancements. They did a very basic version, and it
    will be enhanced per customer demand.

  zh: 珊瑚8刚刚发布了5.3版本。我们要求他们提供一个KDB+适配器，他们做到了。我们认为KDB+在资本市场公司中使用如此频繁，因此珊瑚8开发者能够像读取Oracle或SQL
    Server数据一样轻松读取KDB数据是合情合理的。目前，你仍然需要在Coral8的KDB适配器中编写Q查询，以从KDB+获取数据……我本希望有一种方法，开发者可以编写一个简单的SQL语句，让KDB适配器将查询翻译成Q，但这将留待未来版本。我们要求他们编写这些内容，并将其作为核心产品的一部分提供，希望很多人使用它，调试它，并要求珊瑚8提供更多的改进。他们做了一个非常基础的版本，并将根据客户需求进行改进。
- en: Coral8 also released a Reuters market data adapter, and from what I understand,
    it will be offered as a separate product that costs a not-too-trivial amount of
    money. Our internal framework has built-in market data adapters, so we won't be
    leveraging the Coral8 adapter, especially since it seems like a very vanilla adapter.

  zh: 珊瑚8还发布了一个路透市场数据适配器，据我所知，这将作为一个单独的产品出售，价格不菲。我们内部的框架已经集成了市场数据适配器，所以我们不会利用珊瑚8的适配器，尤其是它看起来非常普通。
- en: It is good that Coral8 has become aware of all of the various adapters needed
    for firms that do trading. It has been about 6 months since we had to explain
    what a FIX message was to the Coral8 people, and they have caught on pretty quickly.
    Coral8 probably had the least amount of captial markets experience of any of the
    CEP vendors, and they are rapidly catching up.

  zh: 珊瑚8意识到为从事交易的公司提供各种适配器是件好事。大约六个月前，我们不得不向珊瑚8的人解释FIX消息是什么，他们很快就掌握了。珊瑚8可能是所有CEP供应商中资本市场经验最少的，但他们正在迅速迎头赶上。
- en: I read with interest the "exciting announcement" that the banking products side
    of Aleri were bought by Wall Street Systems. I don't know quite what to make of
    this. Was this a much-needed infusion of capital? Does Aleri really want to concentrate
    solely on CEP? Was the banking side of Aleri under-performing? I had lunch yesterday
    with a vendor of products that are sold into the capital markets space, and the
    vendor mentioned that the main CEP products that are evaluated are Apama and Streambase,
    with Coral8 gaining more and more interest. Combined with the difficulty of seeling
    into capital markets right now, I wonder if this is the first shoe to drop at
    Aleri.

  zh: 我阅读了Aleri的银行产品被Wall Street Systems收购的“激动人心”的消息，心情复杂。这是资本的急需注入吗？Aleri真的想专注于CEP吗？Aleri的银行业务表现不佳吗？我昨天和一个为资本市场提供产品的供应商吃了午饭，供应商提到目前主要评估的CEP产品是Apama和Streambase，而Coral8越来越受到关注。结合目前进入资本市场的困难，我不禁怀疑这是Aleri第一个要解决的问题。
- en: (A note to PR agencies and Aleri newsletter writers ... you must think that
    the lives of your readers are pretty drab if you consider the above announcement
    to be "exciting".... you need to get out of your offices and see what kind of
    party animals your potential customers are!)

- en: Sprint 2 has completed, and we are starting up Sprint 3\. One of the things
    that is weighing heavily on my mind is the subject of entitlements and Derived
    Events. Certain users should not see certain derived events at all. Certain users
    should only see the partial contents of certain derived events.

  zh: 第二阶段（Sprint 2）已经完成，我们即将开始第三阶段（Sprint 3）。让我心事重重的一个问题是权益和派生事件（Derived Events）的主题。某些用户根本不应该看到某些派生事件。某些用户只能看到某些派生事件的部分内容。
- en: There is no standard entitlements framework out there. Every IB that I have
    been with has had multiple custom-built entitlement frameworks. Morgan Stanley
    had at least 3, and 2 years ago, there was a group that had just been formed in
    order to build the mother of all entitlement frameworks.

  zh: 目前还没有统一的标准权益框架。我所了解的每一个投资银行（IB）都有多个定制的权益框架。摩根士丹利至少有3个，两年前，有一个团队刚刚成立，目的是构建最强大的权益框架。
- en: Our entitlements framework needs to work hand-in-hand with our message bus.
    Most CEP applications are fairly simplistic, and their output goes into a single
    system, so there is no need for entitlements. Other CEP applications want to publish
    everything out to everyone ... a surveillance-type CEP application might be crippled
    if its output is only going to the security guard who is in the middle of a doughnut
    break. We can't let the prop traders see agency flow, and vice-versa. We can't
    let certain people on a single desk see what others on the desk are doing ...
    but the head of the desk should be able to see everything, and if the head of
    the desk is on vacation, the notifications should be transmitted to a chain of
    proxies.

  zh: 我们的权益框架需要与我们的消息总线紧密协作。大多数CEP应用相当简单，它们的输出进入一个单一系统，所以不需要权益管理。其他的CEP应用希望把所有内容都发布给所有人...
    一种监控型的CEP应用如果其输出只发送给正在吃甜甜圈休息的保安，那它可能就会被削弱。我们不能让交易员看到代理流量，反之亦然。我们不能让单一桌面上的某些人看到其他人正在做什么...
    但是桌子的负责人应该能够看到一切，如果桌子的负责人正在休假，通知应该通过一系列代理传输。
- en: It would be great if this kind of feature was built into a CEP engine ... given
    a derived event and a list of fine-grained entitlements, produce a "recipient
    list" of what message bus topics we send the derived event to.
