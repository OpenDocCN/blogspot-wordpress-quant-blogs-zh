    unease about the state of the market in many traders and investors. Clearly a
    sub-20 VIX was underestimating the risks in the current and future market environment,
    they thought. When the VIX dipped below 18.00 that unease intensified and now
    with the VIX hovering around the 15.00 range and I can sense that quite a few
    are ready to grab the nearest pitchfork and riot about the inhumanity of the wayward
    VIX.

    macroeconomic and other factors that pose real threats to the economy and to stocks,
    but I also believe that investors have become so fixated on some of the past problems
    that [availability bias](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/availability%20bias)
    and [disaster imprinting](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/disaster%20imprinting)
    has clouded their judgment to the extent that they cannot separate the current
    market environment from the ghosts of markets past.

    had a sharp market selloff and a subsequent bounce that lasted three years. The
    graphic below shows the percentage change in the SPX as well as the absolute VIX
    level in the three years following the October 2002 lows in the SPX as well as
    the three years following the March 2009 lows. Note that from 2002-2005, the SPX
    rallied about 53%; the current rally in the SPX from the March 2009 close is over
    100%.

    in 2009\. Note that in both instances, the VIX had made it into the teens within
    one year of the beginning of the bull move. As the 2002 bull bounce continued,
    however, the VIX plummeted, spending a great deal of time in the 10-13 range,
    with a median value of 15.30 in the first three years of that bull market. The
    rally off of the 2009 bottom has been a different animal altogether, however,
    with forays down to the 15s being extremely rare (though it did happen on occasion
    in 2010 and 2011) and a median VIX of 22.84 during that same initial three years
    of the bull market.

    concede that the current rally is a bone fide bull market) and every wall of worry
    is made of different types of stones, but at some point investors need to come
    to terms with the reality of a VIX of 15, particularly when we are looking at
    realized volatility that has been [sub-10](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/sub-10)
    for the last two months.
