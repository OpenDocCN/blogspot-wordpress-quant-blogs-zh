    be good in some instances, when dealing with my capital I usually try to keep
    it simple but I try to always steer clear from intellectual laziness.

    of parametric statistics when dealing with market data. A good thing to do before
    using a certain method or model is always to do a little research on the underlying
    assumptions. If they don’t fit our data, then we know we have to be more careful,
    however they can still be quite useful, do not automatically disregard a method
    or model when your assumptions aren’t met.

    model. It is widely used in academia. It is actually quite hard to find a finance
    paper without the mention of regression in a certain way or form. That’s just
    what we do, we like to try and model phenomenon in simple and elegant ways. It
    is often used in its simplest form; the ordinary least square model that you of
    you may know as the linear regression. I am sure that most of the readers of this
    blog used it before in some fashion. I also think that some may have used it without
    really paying attention to some of its assumptions.'

    need to address before we blindly apply it. The big two for financial time series
    are number 3 and 4\. See the post series on GARCH modeling for a more specific
    discussion on the matter [here](https://quantumfinancier.wordpress.com/2010/09/12/381/).

- en: The point here is not to invalidate the least squares method at all; I use it
    frequently. The point is to show that sometimes assumptions can be really restrictive
    and need to be considered regardless of what method or model you want to use,
    and also remember that sometimes, the path of least resistance in trading is not
    always the best. A good habit when stumbling upon a new promising tool for your
    trader’s toolbox is to dig a bit more and understand the underlying process and
    the assumptions you make every time you use it. It is also a nice plug for the
    non-parametric and non-linear statistical methods, who usually tends to have looser
    base assumptions.
