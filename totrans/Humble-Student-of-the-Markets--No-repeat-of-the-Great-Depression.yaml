    of the Great Depression were a sharp hike in interest rates in October 1931 and
    a decline in the overall price level of 10% per year in 1931 and 1932\. Whatever
    else happens, I don't expect those particular mistakes to be repeated by the Bernanke
    Fed.

    embraced around the world, which is highly encouraging for the long-term macroeconomic
    backdrop. The fact that the EU, which has a history of bickering and isn’t known
    for being friendly to open markets, is negotiating free trade deals around the
    world is a bit of a surprise to me.
