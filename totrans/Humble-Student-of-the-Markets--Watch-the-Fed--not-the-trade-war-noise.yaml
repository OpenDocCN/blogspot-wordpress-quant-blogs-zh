    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    signal. A bullish Trend Model signal that gets less bullish is a trading "sell"
    signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading
    "buy" signal. The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of
    the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. The turnover rate
    of the trading model is high, and it has varied between 150% to 200% per month.

    security reasons. The initial announcement shocked the market, but the Trump administration
    eventually walked back most of their effects by providing exemptions for Canada,
    Mexico, the EU, Australia, Argentina, Brazil, and South Korea. Um, those exemptions
    account for over half of American steel imports. What "national security" considerations
    are we referring to?

    by the Trump administration, but the tweaks were only cosmetic in nature. The
    South Koreans agreed to two concessions. In return for an indefinite exemption
    from the steel and aluminum tariffs, Seoul agreed to a steel export quota to the
    US, but the quotas are toothless because they are contrary to WTO rules and could
    be challenged at anytime. In addition, South Korea doubled the ceiling on American
    cars that don't conform to Korean standards which could imported into that country.
    The ceiling increase was meaningless because US automakers were not selling enough
    cars under the old ceiling. In other words, the KORUS free trade deal was a smoke
    and mirrors exercise and a face saving out of a potential trade war.

    in principle in place by the Peru Summit of the Americas that begin April 13 next
    week. How much leverage will the American side have if the other negotiators know
    that Trump wants a deal by next week? Much work needs to be done before an agreement
    in principle can be made, but watch for more climbdowns and a declaration of "victory"
    by the White House.

    error where it tightens into a weakening expansion and crashes the economy. Recessions
    have invariably translated into equity bear markets in the past. That's why investors
    should look past the trade war noise and focus on monetary policy.
