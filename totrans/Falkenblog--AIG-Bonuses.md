# Falkenblog: AIG Bonuses

> 来源：[http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2009/03/aig-bonuses.html#0001-01-01](http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2009/03/aig-bonuses.html#0001-01-01)

A lot of outrage over $450MM in bonuses, but with 115,000 employees, that's only about 4k per employee. Some are contractual payouts from revenues, such as commissions. I don't see how you can stop this.

Now, for those managing people who generate revenues, or managing people who manage people, I agree that these people's bonuses might be inappropriate. But if your base salary is $100k plus x% of commissions, I don't that's excessive or problematic.
