- en: While losing the popular vote in five of the last six presidential elections,
    the flaws of this mentality have become apparent. First, if opposing government
    is your primary objective, it’s hard to have a positive governing program.

    opposed the Dodd-Frank financial regulation law but never offered an alternative.
    The party opposed Obamacare but never offered a replacement. John Podhoretz of
    Commentary added that as soon as Republicans start talking about what kind of
    regulations and programs government should promote, they get accused by colleagues
    of being Big Government conservatives.

    to Republican success is to have a smarter kind of state, not a smaller one.  A
    vote-seeking Republican probably should adopt this attitude if he wants to be
    elected.

    Bush II gave us more (and compassionate) government, and he failed not because
    he wasn't sincere, but because more government is never smarter. Dodd-Frank and
    Obamacare just add more bureaucracy to sectors that already are over and mis-regulated.
