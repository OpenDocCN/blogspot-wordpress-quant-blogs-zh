    this erstwhile catchphrase of the infant Chinese republic? How could a thinking
    people accept this and a host of other bald statements at face value, without
    so much as a raised eyebrow or a silently murmured really?...As early as 1942,
    seven years before the founding of the People''s Republic, Chairman Mao was explaining
    to government leaders and intellectuals that the purpose of art and culture was

    up controversy. Typically the statement is so absurd that only the most noobish
