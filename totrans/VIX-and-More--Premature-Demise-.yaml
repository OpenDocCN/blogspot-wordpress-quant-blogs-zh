    track of [how well gurus forecast the future](http://www.cxoadvisory.com/gurus/)
    of the markets and has concluded that as a group, the success of guru predictions
    averages a little worse than a coin flip.

    [Van Kampen Investments](http://www.vankampen.com/index.asp) from predicting that
    the VIX “[may become as relevant as yesterday’s news.](http://www.vankampen.com/vksite/news/commentary/insightline071607.asp)”  Schumacher
    cites the elimination of the short selling “uptick rule” ([Rule 10a-1](http://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2007/34-55970fr.pdf)
    of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934) as the culprit and argues that unencumbered
    short selling will lead to increased short sales and a corresponding decrease
    in demand for puts.

    the key question is one of scale, which quickly calls up issues of leverage, liquidity
    and transaction costs.  My best guess is that the end of the uptick rule will
    have a negligible impact on put volume, as short sellers continue to favor the
    highly leveraged bets on baskets of large stocks that puts make possible.  I also
    suspect that most market players ultimately believe blanket portfolio insurance
    is cheaper and more effective than point insurance – and the weaving together
    of a constantly moving thousand point quilt.

    the popularity of any instrument that is setting new volume records, as VIX options
    did [less than a week ago](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/07/new-vix-options-volume-record-yesterday.html),
    just a couple of days after the uptick rule was eliminated.

    becoming a better trader.  If he’s wrong, I sure hope he has hedged his position
    with puts…
