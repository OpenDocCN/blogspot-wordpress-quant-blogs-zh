- en: As the financial world holds its breath and waits for the US jobs number release,
    I thought that it would be instructive to put some context to the process of investing.
    Too often, people get overly distracted by the latest economic release, or about
    what's happening to the latest hot stock and don't pay enough attention to why
    they are investing.

- en: Here is an example. I recently spoke to a serial entrepreneur who had sold one
    of his businesses and netted a substantial sum of money. It has been sitting in
    a bank account receiving daily interest and he didn't know what to do with it.
    He is financial well established, has several children and grandchildren. As part
    of his tax planning, he moved some of the funds are into foundation(s). He then
    complained that he and his wife had been inundated with proposals from private
    bankers and financial advisors but found many of the proposals overly self-serving.
    He was simply at a loss of what to do.

- en: In terms of setting investment policy, I am a great fan of using an asset-liability
    management (ALM) framework for pension funds and foundations. The proper approach
    is to create a custom liability benchmark and then set investment policy in accordance
    to that benchmark. The custom liability benchmark is a way to force the organization
    to define its investment goals in an explicit way. Variance from the benchmark
    is considered to be active management and needs to be justified.
