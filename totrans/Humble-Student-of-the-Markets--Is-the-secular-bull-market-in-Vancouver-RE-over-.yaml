    because the topic isn't within the scope of this blog and I don't have much in
    the way of unique insights. However, I have a personal interest since I live here.
    In addition, several items came across my desk that piqued my interest.

    Vancouver’s housing markets. Standard tests find significant correlations between
    the country’s real GDP growth and three important market yardsticks: existing
    home sales, existing home price growth and total housing starts. By contrast,
    local employment growth is significantly correlated to none of these and the five-year
    rate related to only the resale variables. This could mean that a substantial
    proportion of Vancouver real estate purchasers do not need local jobs to buy any
    home (new or existing) and that many do not need a mortgage to buy a new home.
    On the other hand, better economic health in China gives its residents wealth
    to spend on Vancouver housing.'

    suggests that Vancouver property prices have been buoyed over the last couple
    of decades by several waves overseas buyers. The first was from Hong Kong, followed
    by the Taiwanese and now the Mainland Chinese.
