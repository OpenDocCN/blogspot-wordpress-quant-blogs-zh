- en: Smart beta products are a disruptive financial innovation with the potential
    to significantly affect the business of traditional active management. They provide
    an important component of active management via simple, transparent, rules-based
    portfolios delivered at lower fees. They clarify that what investors need from
    their active managers is pure alpha—returns beyond those from static exposures
    to smart beta factors. To effectively position themselves for this evolution in
    active management, asset managers need to understand the mix of smart beta and
    pure alpha in their products, as well as their comparative advantages relative
    to competitors in delivering these important components.
