- en: The beauty of EVIX and EXIV is that these products create so much flexibility
    for investors who maintain a global, cross-asset class view of volatility.  In
    the run-up to the first round of the French election, for example, VSTOXX spiked
    dramatically and pushed the VSTOXX:VIX ratio below 1.00, creating some interesting
    arbitrage opportunities and/or pairs trades in the process.  Now investors can
    trade euro zone volatility against U.S. volatility, use targeted hedges for risk
    that is specific to the euro zone or speculate more easily about the direction
    of volatility in the euro zone.

    of the breadth of volatility products.  If you would like a diverse tapestry of
    volatility products in the future, it would not hurt to “buy local” volatility
    ETPs rather than sticking to the handful of already successful products.  If you
    don’t vote with your feet, you had better be happy playing in a small and rather
    limited sandbox.  I am fond of saying, “In volatility, there is opportunity!”
    – but that opportunity is a function of the richness of the various volatility
    product platforms.
