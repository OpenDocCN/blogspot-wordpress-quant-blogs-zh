- en: Several readers noted that options on leveraged ETFs seemed like a recipe for
    disaster, as if no good could possibly come from piling leverage on top of leverage.
    While I certainly understand the sentiment, this type of thinking is typical of
    investors who have little or no experience in options. To the investor who is
    not versed in options, the options world often seems to be limited to an occasional
    covered call or an out-of-the-money call that is barely distinguishable from a
    lottery ticket – and seems to pay out just about as often.

    they are an excellent way to define, limit and manage [risk](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/risk).
    Yes, one can buy a put to provide protection for a long stock protection, but
    in the absence of owning the underlying (be it as stock, ETF, index or whatever),
    options traders are particularly fond of creating multi-leg options positions
    where the downside risk is known at the beginning of the trade and does not waver
    as long as the position is maintained.

    for [FAS](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/FAS), perhaps the most notorious
    of the [Direxion](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Direxion) triple
    ETFs, in the table below. With a current mean implied volatility of 126, FAS is
    a highly volatile ETF. FAS is so volatile that even with only 17 trading days
    remaining in the June calls, it is possible to sell the June 15 calls, which are
    70% out of the money, for 0.05\. The June 11 calls, which are 24.4% out of the
    money, can be sold for 0.40.

- en: In terms of risk management, let’s say that an investor does not believe that
    FAS is going to rise more than 24% in the next 3 ½ weeks, so he or she decides
    to sell the June 11 calls, but hedge that position by buying an equal amount of
    the June 13 calls at 0.15\. This is a [bear call spread](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/bear%20call%20spread)
    and will net $25 for each option contract, with a maximum loss of $175 per contract
    (not including commissions). The trade makes money if FAS expires at 11.25 or
    less, which means that the position can absorb up to a 27.2% gain in FAS. The
    trade offers odds of 7-1 ($175 to $25) and the maximum risk is defined up front
    and cannot change during the life of the trade.

    ETFs. There are many other potential examples.

- en: The bottom line is that options trades can be structured in such a manner that
    they are much *less* risky than stock trades, even if the options are on volatile
    securities such as triple ETFs.

    standardized on the options tools and graphics available through optionsXpress.
