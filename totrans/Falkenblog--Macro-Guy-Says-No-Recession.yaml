    what I'm seeing anecdotally, as business outside of housing seems at full speed.

    used a Kalman filter, just like real rocket scientists--the model failed to predict
    the 1990-1991 recession, and an updated version of the model then failed to predict
    the 2001 recession. Stock and Watson (

    is hard to predict recessions because each is caused by a unique set of factors.
    For instance, housing and durable goods consumption was strong proceeding and
    throughout the 2001 recession, as the decline was focused on IT manufacturing.
    By contrast, in the 1990-1991 recessions, housing and durable goods spending slowed
    considerably. As Stock and Watson say, "without knowing these shocks in advance,
    it is unclear how a forecaster would have decided in 1999 which of the many promising
    leading indicators would perform well over the next few years and which would
    not". Indeed.
