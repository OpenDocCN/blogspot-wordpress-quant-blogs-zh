    realize. The global financial crisis today highlights serious deficiencies our
    true understanding of the subject. Multi-asset and large-scale risk allocation
    is a highly dimensional problem for which there is no closed-form solution. The
    integration of both qualitative and quantitative considerations are necessary
    in the context  of an adequate solution. As with most cases in the investment
    world, the approach is always polarized towards philosphical preference : Discretionary
    portfolio managers realize the limitations of basic numerical solutions and how
    to apply “common sense” to capture these deficiencies. The drawback is that they
    tend to substitute rules of thumb that lack rigor, accuracy, or sufficient complexity.
    In contrast, “quants” often fail to account for both common sense and the violation
    in the assumptions underlying their models that are present in real-life problems.
    To their credit, they use models that are far more capable of handling such complex
    problems in an unbiased manner.'

    of assets, it is also about the relationships between those assets, the relative
    risk contribution of those assets, and also possibility of a sudden large loss
    or default. This is by no means a complete accounting, which is beyond the scope
    of this post. There is a much simpler formula that is straightforward to derive
    from portfolio mathematics that neatly captures many of the nuances of diversification
    and its contribution to risk reduction in a portfolio context:'

    assets is insufficient for calculating portfolio risk– but this is still not clear
    enough to describe the levers that drive portfolio risk. We know that actual portfolio
    risk is always less than the average portfolio risk across assets as long as the
    correlation between assets is less than perfect.  The difference can be described
    as the *risk reduction due to diversification*.

    risk is reduced in a portfolio format?  Lets assume  that the standard deviation
    of all assets are approximately the same and have a value of 20% annualized. This
    means that the average risk or variance is 4%. The average SDP (standard deviation
    product) is also equivalent to 4%  since all assets have a standard deviation

    “K” and 3) the average correlation between assets. The constant “K” can be thought
    of as an inverse multiplier(1/number of assets) that weights the contribution
    of average asset risk  to portfolio risk as a function of the number of assets
    in the portfolio. The higher “K” is, the less important the average asset risk
    is and the more important the average correlation between assets becomes. Other
    things being equal, the more assets in the portfolio at a given level of average
    correlation will reduce risk at the portfolio level.  The constant “K” becomes
    quite small with even 10 assets, making the contribution of the first term of
    the equation less important.  In fact for large data sets with greater than 50
    assets, the portfolio risk formula can actually be roughly approximated by :'

    that have a low average correlation. To maximize this effect, we need to ensure
    that we have a lot of assets and also use assets that have similar risks (or one
    can create equivalent asset risks  through volatility sizing).  It is this general
    intuition that drives portfolio algorithms that seek to maximize diversification
    or minimize portfolio correlations……………….
