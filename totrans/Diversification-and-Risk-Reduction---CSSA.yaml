    realize. The global financial crisis today highlights serious deficiencies our
    true understanding of the subject. Multi-asset and large-scale risk allocation
    is a highly dimensional problem for which there is no closed-form solution. The
    integration of both qualitative and quantitative considerations are necessary
    in the context  of an adequate solution. As with most cases in the investment
    world, the approach is always polarized towards philosphical preference : Discretionary
    portfolio managers realize the limitations of basic numerical solutions and how
    to apply “common sense” to capture these deficiencies. The drawback is that they
    tend to substitute rules of thumb that lack rigor, accuracy, or sufficient complexity.
    In contrast, “quants” often fail to account for both common sense and the violation
    in the assumptions underlying their models that are present in real-life problems.
    To their credit, they use models that are far more capable of handling such complex
    problems in an unbiased manner.'

    of assets, it is also about the relationships between those assets, the relative
    risk contribution of those assets, and also possibility of a sudden large loss
    or default. This is by no means a complete accounting, which is beyond the scope
    of this post. There is a much simpler formula that is straightforward to derive
    from portfolio mathematics that neatly captures many of the nuances of diversification

    assets is insufficient for calculating portfolio risk– but this is still not clear
    enough to describe the levers that drive portfolio risk. We know that actual portfolio
    risk is always less than the average portfolio risk across assets as long as the
    correlation between assets is less than perfect.  The difference can be described
    as the *risk reduction due to diversification*.

  zh: 从这个公式清楚地看出，跨资产的平均标准偏差不足以计算投资组合风险-但这仍然不足以描述驱动投资组合风险的杠杆。我们知道，只要资产之间的相关性不完美，实际投资组合风险总是小于跨资产的平均投资组合风险。差异可以描述为由于分散化而导致的*风险降低*。

  zh: 我们如何将以上的投资组合风险公式翻译成易于理解的投资组合格式以了解风险是如何在投资组合中减少的？假设所有资产的标准偏差大约相同，并且年化值为20%。这意味着平均风险或方差为4%。由于所有资产的标准偏差都为20%，因此平均SDP（标准偏差乘积）也等于4%。这意味着投资组合风险公式可以轻松地表示为：

    “K” and 3) the average correlation between assets. The constant “K” can be thought
    of as an inverse multiplier(1/number of assets) that weights the contribution
    of average asset risk  to portfolio risk as a function of the number of assets
    in the portfolio. The higher “K” is, the less important the average asset risk
    is and the more important the average correlation between assets becomes. Other
    things being equal, the more assets in the portfolio at a given level of average
    correlation will reduce risk at the portfolio level.  The constant “K” becomes
    quite small with even 10 assets, making the contribution of the first term of
    the equation less important.  In fact for large data sets with greater than 50
    assets, the portfolio risk formula can actually be roughly approximated by :'

  zh: 投资组合风险显然是三个因素的函数：1）平均资产风险，2）常数“K”，以及3）资产之间的平均相关性。常数“K”可以被看作是一个倒数乘数（1/资产数量），它根据投资组合中的资产数量将平均资产风险对投资组合风险的贡献加权。常数“K”越高，平均资产风险的重要性就越小，资产之间的平均相关性就越重要。其他条件相同，投资组合中资产数量越多，给定平均相关性水平的情况下，将降低投资组合风险。即使只有10种资产，常数“K”也会变得非常小，使得方程的第一项的贡献变得不那么重要。事实上，对于具有超过50种资产的大型数据集，投资组合风险公式实际上可以被粗略近似为：

    that have a low average correlation. To maximize this effect, we need to ensure
    that we have a lot of assets and also use assets that have similar risks (or one
    can create equivalent asset risks  through volatility sizing).  It is this general
    intuition that drives portfolio algorithms that seek to maximize diversification
    or minimize portfolio correlations……………….

  zh: 这是直观的-为了降低投资组合风险，我们需要找到平均相关性低的资产。为了最大化这种效果，我们需要确保拥有大量资产，并且还要使用风险相似的资产（或者可以通过波动率大小创建等效资产风险）。正是这种一般直觉推动了寻求最大化分散化或最小化投资组合相关性的投资组合算法………………。
