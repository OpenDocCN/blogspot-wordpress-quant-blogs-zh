I have pointed out before that the last time the 10-year Treasury yield was at these levels, the S&P 500 was trading at a forward P/E of 14-16\.

Either the discount rate has to fall, which expands P/E ratios, or earnings have to rise.

Since global central bankers are engaged in a tightening cycle, the prospect of falling rates is off the table. In that case, what's the outlook for earnings?
