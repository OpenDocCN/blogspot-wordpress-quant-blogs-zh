# VIX and More: Second Highest VIX Close Ever: 69.25

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/10/second-highest-vix-close-ever-6925.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/10/second-highest-vix-close-ever-6925.html#0001-01-01)

The VIX spiked to 69.47 at 4:07 p.m. ET, just a few minutes after the equity markets closed (the VIX is calculated up until 4:15 p.m. ET, when index options trading ends) and settled at 69.25 for the day.

This makes today the second highest close ever for the VIX, behind the [69.95 from last Friday](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/10/two-more-vix-records.html).

To put things into perspective:

*   the VIX's 10 day moving average is now 56.69

*   the VIX October futures settled today at 58.00
