- en: After giving it fairly [prominent play](http://ronsen.blogspot.com/search?q=SPX%3AVIX)
    over the past few months at [Technically Speaking](http://ronsen.blogspot.com/),
    Ron Sen asks whether the SPX:VIX ratio chart works effectively as a risk metric.

- en: Many people seem to be giving up on the VIX lately, but the SPX:VIX ratio is
    a special case.  Part of the problem with this ratio is that it compares one trending
    number with another one that oscillates.  Using Ibbotson data as a guide, we can
    assume -- over the long term at least -- that the SPX should return about 10%
    per year, while the VIX should oscillate around a stable mean.  Interestingly,
    if you add a 10% trend line to the SPX:VIX ratio chart going back to 1991 in order
    to compensate for this, you will discover that 15 ½ years later, the trend line
    almost perfectly bisects the current Bollinger bands.

    the SPX:VIX ratio has rarely strayed far from the values predicted by the 10%
    trend line

- en: the current deviation above the trend line is matched only by mid-2000, early
    1994 and late 1995 – three periods that turned out to be the beginning of a deep
    bear, a mild bear and a strong bull market

- en: I think the SPX:VIX ratio is indeed a useful risk metric, but I recommend using
    it in a manner that compensates for the long-term bullish bias in stocks and/or
    that focuses largely on the relative peaks and valleys.

- en: At the moment, I think the SPX:VIX ratio is flashing a mild warning sign, but
    ultimately where you come down on the ratio is probably more dependent upon what
    you think about reasons for the historically low VIX than the historically high
    SPX.
