    in the Globe and Mail entitled [Why this rally will end in tears](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/economy/economy-lab/david-rosenberg/why-this-market-rally-will-end-in-tears/article1874891/):
    Last week, Rosenberg called the current state of the financial market a [Wile
    E. Coyote market](http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2011/01/wile-e-coyote-market/),
    or a market that seemingly ignores the major macro-economic risks that could blow
    up the global economy.'

    spasms can go further than anyone thinks. But after the U.S. market staged a monstrous
    80-per-cent-plus rally from its March, 2009, lows (the most pronounced bounce
    in such a short time since 1955), it has become seriously overextended. Meanwhile,
    practically every pundit is extrapolating the recent trend into the future because
    that is the easy thing to do.

    risks. But the risks are there. I recall all too well the 2003-07 bear market
    rally – yes, that is what it was. It was no long-term bull run such as 1949-1966
    or 1982-2000\. It was a classic bear market rally, and it ended in tears because
    what drove the market upward was phony wealth generated by a non-productive asset
    called housing alongside widespread financial engineering, which triggered a wave
    of artificial paper profits.

    risks to this upturn, most of the risks in his outline are economic in nature
    and could be addressed by central bank action. In such a case, the question for
    investors has to be: Were any of these negative outcomes were to occur, would
    the Bernanke Fed respond with another round of quantitative easing? In other words,
    is there a Bernanke Put in the market?'
