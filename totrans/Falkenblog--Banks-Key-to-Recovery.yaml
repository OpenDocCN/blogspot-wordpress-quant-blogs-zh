     I'm a big believer that banks are key to this recovery, but I'm skeptical that
    bailouts are actually helpful.  That is, the best way to add a lack of focus to
    a bank is to make it even more beholden to 'the public'. A restructuring or default
    would be preferred, because then the pain is allocated to investors, and so new
    owners can start over without any baggage from prior favors from politicians and
    just maximize profits (there's a good reason to think this is what banks should
    be doing, but I understand many find that argument incomprehensible).

    like in a Merton model, but as a barrier option on a firm, the vega actually becomes
    negative when the firm value is sufficiently low.  This would mean banks go from
    taking on new projects to maximize equity value, to shedding projects.

    some relevance to our rather unusually soft recovery.
