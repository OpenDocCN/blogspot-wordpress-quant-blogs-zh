- en: Strong, persistent moves often do not roll over immediately.  Real persistency
    can set up a situation where strength begets more strength.  An example of that
    concept was triggered with Friday’s setup, where we had the 1st down day after
    5 consecutive higher closes.

- en: Initially there appears to be a moderate inclination for a bounce.  Once you
    get out 9-10 days the upside edge appears very substantial.  Based on this, there
    appears a good chance that the dip that started Friday may not get too far before
    the market again moves higher.
