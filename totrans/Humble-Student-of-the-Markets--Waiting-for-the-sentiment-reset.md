# Humble Student of the Markets: Waiting for the sentiment reset

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2021/02/waiting-for-sentiment-reset.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2021/02/waiting-for-sentiment-reset.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models**

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post,

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The

**Trend Asset Allocation Model**

is an asset allocation model that applies trend following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or contraction (bearish)?"

My inner trader uses a

**trading model**

, which is a blend of price momentum (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa). Subscribers receive real-time alerts of model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of the email alerts are updated weekly

. The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that began in March 2016 is shown below.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Buy equities*
*   Trend Model signal: Bullish*
*   Trading model: Neutral*

**In need of a washout **

While I am a long-term equity bull, sentiment models are extremely stretched in this market and in desperate need of a reset. The latest BoA Global Fund Manager survey shows that institutional risk appetite is at historically high levels.

Retail risk appetite is even more stretched. The CBOE equity put/call ratio (CPCE), which tends to measure retail sentiment, is extremely low indicating excessive bullishness. By contrast, the index put/call ratio (CPCI), which measures institutional hedging activity, has been rising indicating cautiousness. Such high spreads between CPCE and CPCI have resolved themselves with market pullbacks in the past.

This is insane! When's the sentiment reset?
