    expected loss increases over a default rate, that is, the total return is higher
    for junk bonds than for investment grade bonds; risk begets return and all that.
    But consider that the Merrill Lynch High Yield Index had a 6.75% return from 1987
    through Sep 2008, whereas the Merrill Lynch Investment Grade Index had a 6.49%
    annualized return. That's 26 basis points difference in return, unadjusted for
    risk, in an index. Add the transaction costs, and the returns to the junk bond
    index are lower than for investment grade, yet academics seem unaware of this.

    points. Bloomberg benchmark curves, and data I had at Moody's, would estimate
    a 405 basis points spread from 1991 to 2005, so I have no idea where they are
    getting their data. Hull et al mention Merrill, but I'm not sure which index.
    It's wrong.

    grade credit default swaps are largely connected to the worst economic states,
    suggesting that they should trade at significantly higher yield spreads than single-name
    bonds with identical credit ratings. Surprisingly, this implication turns out
    not to be supported by the data.

    tour of finance seminars never seemed to flag the absence of a risk premium in
    junk bonds, which makes their paper''s premise moot. What are its potentially
    perverse incentives? They point out that AAA CDOs have more cyclicality than AAA
    for regular bonds, but the correlation of the AAA security is hardly as important
    or interesting as its default rate point estimate. They get an irrelevant answer,
    that people are arbitraging a risk-premium that doesn''t exist. It''s just wrong
    on so many levels: the risk premium does not exist in the collateral where it
    really matters in CDOs (junk), or the tranches; the marginal players in these
    deals are the equity owners of the deals, not the AAA investors; AAA ABS has higher
    returns than straight corporate AAA rated debt so the arb there is absent (especially
    as AAA ABS will take a generation to gain credibility as truly AAA again).'

    0.7 moneyness is not). Just wrong.
