    about has nothing to do with Google helping anyone. The hazards of writing and
    the production process. But ignore that -- I think the subject matter is important,
    and I wanted to offer some further information on what I wrote about there, and
    a link to the original research.

    the analysis of global financial risks what Google did for web search -- make
    it really possible to determine which elements in the network matter most.

- en: The essential insight of the PageRank algorithm is that in any network of things
    that make references to each other -- web pages through hypertext links, or scientific
    papers through citations, for example -- each element effectively votes for other
    importance of other elements by linking to them. Hence, the most important web
    pages, Page and Brin reasoned, should be those drawing links from many other pages,
    especially from other really important pages. The best scientific papers should
    be those that get those most references, especially from other profoundly important
    scientific papers (rather than from papers no one ever reads).

- en: To calculate the PageRank of a web page (or a scientific paper), you have to
    look at all the web pages that link to it. The page gets a higher PageRank in
    so far as many other pages link to it, especially if those other pages are important,
    i.e. are pages that have many other web pages linking to them, especially other
    important web pages. The definition is obviously circular -- you have to know
    which pages are important in order to be able to calculate which pages are important.
    That may seem useless, but this problem is easy to sort out mathematically (it's
    just some linear algebra).  That's what Google algorithm does, and it can be done
    with lots of computing power, which makes Google so powerful (this is of course
    only part of the recipe of the search engine).

    that present the greatest risks to the financial system are those that, if they
    fail, would cause the widest spread of economic distress. Naturally, you would
    tend to have a high DebtRank if you are linked by loans and other financial ties
    to other firms with high DebtRank -- the same circularity again.

    the DebtRank using real data (a partial network of financial ties between institutions
    based on public information). This is what Battiston and colleagues have done,
    and it shows some surprises. At the peak of the financial crisis, for example,
    DebtRank measures for the largest 20 or so banks show that simple bank size just
    isn''t as important as we''ve come to think. Institutions such as Barclays, Bank
    of America, JP Morgan and Royal Bank of Scotland presented more systemic risk
    than did Citigroup or Deutsche Bank, despite being significantly smaller in total
    assets. Wells Fargo stands out even more: It presented as much systemic risk as
    Citigroup, despite having only a quarter of the assets.'

    incomplete. But it shows quite clearly how the phrase "too big to fail" is slightly
    misleading. We need to worry about which institutions are too central to fail,
    or really a mixture of too big and too central, and this is what something like
    DebtRank lets you get at.

    will require much more public knowledge of the links between institutions, most
    of which are currently not public. For more information, I suggest looking at
    the web site of the European project FOC (Forecasting Financial Crises), in which
    this research took place. In particular, you may want to have a look at the
