- en: With the launch of the subscriber newsletter, I am in the process of making
    decisions about what content is directed toward the blog and what content is reserved
    for the newsletter. I suspect that blog readers should see very little in the
    way of changes, though I have dropped the weekly update to the Portfolio A1, which
    did not seem to be generating a great deal of interest.

  zh: 随着订阅者通讯的推出，我正在决定将哪些内容定向到博客，哪些内容保留给通讯。我怀疑博客读者几乎看不到任何变化，尽管我已经取消了对A1投资组合的每周更新，因为这似乎没有引起太多兴趣。
- en: I also used to do a weekly VIX and [VWSI](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VWSI)
    update, with a few snippets about market activity thrown in. These will remain,
    albeit not necessarily with the same level of commentary about put to call ratios
    and other market sentiment indicators.

  zh: 我以前还每周更新VIX和[VWSI](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VWSI)，并附带一些关于市场活动的片段。这些内容将继续存在，尽管可能不再有关于看涨期权和看跌期权比率以及其他市场情绪指标的同等评论水平。
- en: Speaking of which, the VIX lost 0.91 (3.4%) last week to close at 25.71\. During
    the course of the week, the VIX oscillated in a tight range between 24.75 and
    27.04\. This is the narrowest weekly range for the VIX since the year began (actually
    the smallest range in percentage terms since the week before the 2/27/07 VIX spike),
    and the VWSI responded to the slow week in volatility by ticking up from zero
    to +1.

  zh: 谈到这一点，上周VIX下跌了0.91（3.4%），收于25.71。在整个周内，VIX在24.75和27.04之间的范围内波动。这是自年初以来VIX的最窄周范围（实际上是自2/27/07
    VIX飙升前一周以来的最小范围，以百分比计算），而VWSI则在波动率低迷的一周里从零上升到+1。
- en: I have had several readers comment about the possibility of an impending VIX
    spike, but these are notoriously difficult to predict. Further, with the constant
    drumbeat of gloom and doom, I find it difficult to believe that there are many
    out there who might consider buying puts, but have not already done so. If there
    is to be another VIX spike, there must be a sufficient element of surprise to
    cause a panic, yet each new negative headline or financial implosion scenario
    probably does more to reduce the pool of future put buyers than anything else.
    For that reason, I see a VWSI of +1 to be entirely plausible, even when the VIX
    has been drifting down in the face of continued uncertainty.

  zh: 我有几位读者评论即将出现的VIX飙升的可能性，但这些飙升众所周知是很难预测的。此外，随着不断传出的阴暗和厄运，我很难相信还有多少人可能会考虑购买看跌期权，而尚未这么做。如果要发生另一次VIX飙升，就必须有足够的意外因素引起恐慌，但每一条新的负面头条或金融崩溃场景可能都会减少未来看跌期权买家的数量。因此，我认为即使在VIX在持续不确定性面前下跌的情况下，VWSI达到+1也是完全可能的。
