- en: He doesn't understand that civility is **more** important the greater the stakes,
    because they are helpful and takes discipline. It's easy to lose it and just start
    calling someone names, questioning their motives, but this is just appealing to
    your base emotions, as highlighted by the behavior people with their frontal lobe
    activity reduced (i.e., drunk people). On the other hand, on issues that are not
    important, well, it's easy to be gracious about things that don't matter because
    it takes no effort, there's nothing to restrain, there's no cost of doing so because
    you don't care if you 'lose'. If you are trying to bring a crowd to your point
    of view, manners are very helpful, they are a better sign of good faith argumentation.
    If you are just being angry, this can help incite a predisposed mob, but little
    else because everyone knows that someone highly emotional is not reasoning at
    all, just rationalizing. Sure, we all do it, but if we don't at least pretend
    not to, we clearly are not coming close to the rational objective we all aspire
    to in less heated environments.
