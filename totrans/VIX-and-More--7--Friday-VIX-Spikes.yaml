- en: So the VIX jumped 7% on Friday.  Considering that the VIX also managed to set
    a new low for the 100 day SMA for the 34^(th) consecutive day, it is a little
    early to declare the recent period of low volatility to be over.  Still, Friday’s
    move warrants closer inspection.

  zh: 所以VIX在周五跳升了7%。考虑到VIX还设法连续第34天创下100天SMA的新低，现在就宣布近期低波动期已经结束还为时尚早。不过，周五的走势值得进一步关注。

    reading is right in the lower middle of the range for where we “should be,” based
    on [historical precedent](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/02/bouncing-back-from-sub-10-vix.html)
    13 days removed from the 9.89 close on January 24^(th).

  zh: 查看VIX从低于10的收盘价反弹的情况，当前的11.10读数正好位于我们“应该”所在的较低中位数范围内，基于[历史先例](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/02/bouncing-back-from-sub-10-vix.html)从1月24日收盘价9.89反弹13天后。

    a 7% spike in the VIX unusual?  Not really.  It happens about once every two weeks,
    on average.  Interestingly, a 7% jump occurs just 5.2% of the time on Fridays,
    but 10.2% of the time on any other day of the week.  Monday sees the most volatility,
    a subject I will tackle in this space in the near future.'

- en: 'Getting back to the 7% rise on Fridays, as the adjacent composite graphic shows,
    there is typically a small (0.6%) follow-through on the day after the +7% Friday,
    with a gradual lessening of volatility over the course of the next 1 ½ weeks.  The
    data for the high closes over the two weeks following these 45 Friday 7% spikes
    also supports the idea of the Friday spike and Monday follow-through as being
    the high point in this sequence is: fully 27% of the time, the Friday closed held
    up as the high close over the next two weeks; another 20% of the time, the Monday
    close turned out to be the high close during this period.'

  zh: 回到周五7%的跳升，正如旁边的复合图形所示，通常在+7%周五之后的第二天会有一个小幅（0.6%）的跟进，接下来的一周半时间内波动性逐渐减弱。在接下来的两周内，这些45个周五7%跳升的高收盘价也支持了周五跳升和周一跟进是这个序列的高点：在27%的时间里，周五的收盘价保持为接下来两周的高收盘价；在另外20%的时间里，周一的收盘价在这个时期内成为最高收盘价。

    after the initial move, so if Wednesday’s retails sales numbers or Bernanke's
    testimony does not put a scare into the markets and keep them on edge, the VIX
    spike will likely already have been trampled by the next bull leg.
