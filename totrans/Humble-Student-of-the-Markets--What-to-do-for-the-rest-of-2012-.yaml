    the traders to try to catch the breakouts or breakdowns.

    slowdown". Consider this relative performance chart of the Morgan Stanley Cyclical
    Index (CYC) against the market. Cyclical stocks have been in a relative downtrend
    since February. The message of the market from relative underperformance of the
    cyclical sector says "cyclical downturn".

    story. This sector had been the leaders for quite some time, but this sector is
    now rolling over on a relative basis, which is not a good sign for the risk-on,
    high beta trade.

    any leadership either. The relative performance of the equal-weighted NASDAQ 100,
    which takes out the effects of heavyweight and market darlings such as Apple,
    has been rolling over on a relative basis.

- en: If we were to only look at the relative performance of US sectors, the story
    would look dire. However, an analysis of globally cyclically sensitive indicators
    don't tell the same story of a cyclical downturn. The chart of Dr. Copper, for
    example, is showing signs of stabilization. The price of the red metal stopped
    going down in June and has started to consolidate sideways - indicating that the
    one big consumer of commodities, i.e. China, may be starting to bottom.

    Canadian economies are similar in their commodity exposure. The only difference
    is Australia is more sensitive to Chinese demand while Canada is more sensitive
    to American demand. The rally in the AUDCAD rate is an indication that the growth
    expectations are turning around on the Chinese economy compared American one.

    of the cyclically sensitive South Korean market, or economy. The chart below of
    the relative performance of the Korean ETF against the MSCI All-Country World
    Index ETF (ACWI) shows Korea to be range bound on a relative basis. The relative
    performance of Korea against ACWI stands in marked contrast to the relative performance
    of the CYC against the SPX shown above.

    to turn bearish. My take is that the leadership will start to shift away from
    US equities to stocks more exposed to the global cycle. The most likely scenario
    is that US stocks will follow the election cycle and continue to grind upward,
    though in a highly choppy fashion.
