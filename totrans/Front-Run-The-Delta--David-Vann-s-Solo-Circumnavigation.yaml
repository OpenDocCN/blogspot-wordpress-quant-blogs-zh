    a boat that will sail nonstop around the world, covering twenty-five thousand
    miles in four months. It will have to sail fast in light air in the equatorial
    regions and also survive fifty-foot seas and hundred-knot winds in the terrifying
    Southern Ocean as I sail around Antarctica. And I''m building the boat myself,
    quickly, in a month or two, so it''s flat bottomed, with straight sides, and as
    skinny and light and simple as possible."'
