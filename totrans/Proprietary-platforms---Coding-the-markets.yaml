    days. JP Morgan has [JPMorganExpress](https://jpmorganexpress.jpmorgan.com/jpm/flowbiz/jpex/01.html),
    Lehman has [LehmanLive](https://live.lehman.com), and DrKW has [Revolution](https://www.drkwrevolution.com/Default.aspx).
    I have a hard time understanding who uses these, and why. If I'm a buy side trader,
    say a pension fund manager, and I need to buy 100m 10yr EuroGovies, why would
    I use a proprietary platform ?  Surely I'd go to [TradeWeb](http://www.tradeweb.com/default.aspx)
    or [Bloomberg](http://www.bloomberg.com/index.html), and do a multi dealer RFQ
    to get the best price ?

    But the buy side guys get performance bonuses too, don't they ?

    used Java applets to get interactive trading functionality into the browser. The
    DrKW offering looks Javaish too. I wonder if anyone's considering building a browser
    trading client with AJAX, or with the Adobe/Macromedia [Flash/RIA](http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Flex_Enterprise_Services:resources:articles:Architecting_RIA's_with_Flex_Data_Services)
    platform used by [Pandora](http://www.pandora.com) ?
