# Humble Student of the Markets: Inflation, here is thy sting

Last Thurday, David Rosenberg wrote a headline entitled Inflation,

[Where is Thy Sting?](https://ems.gluskinsheff.net/Articles/Breakfast_with_Dave_121610.pdf)

(subscription required). He outlined his bull case for bonds by showing the chart below of core CPI and went on to comment that there are many disinflationary and deflationary forces at work in the economy.

The mistake that economists like Rosie and central bankers make, IMHO, is to look at core CPI, or the Consumer Price Index ex-food and energy. Inflation is happening in hard assets, i.e. commodity prices. QE2 is blowing a hard asset bubble and it is precisely this blinkered view of measuring inflation as inflation ex-inflation that created the conditions for the last financial crisis.

My

[Inflation Deflation Timer Model](http://www.qwestfunds.com/publications/newsletters_pdf/newsletter_november_2009.pdf)

defines inflation as commodity inflation. It is in commodity and hard asset prices that we see inflation. Take a look at the point and figure chart of the CRB Index, which shows the reflation in commodity prices much more clearly.

**Inflation stinging in emerging market economies**

The sting of inflation is showing up in the emerging market economies, where rising food prices are stinging the consumer. (Oh sorry I forgot, food inflation isn't inflation!)

China has a de facto USD peg and that policy means that, in the absence of other action, US monetary policy is Chinese monetary policy. The tsunami of liquidity that the Fed loosened on the markets is washing up on Chinese shores, where it has resulted in

 (see the satellite photos

). What's more, all that liquidity sloshing around has fueled a boom in Chinese antiques, where stories of record prices paid for

and for

abound.

That is where inflation is stinging. Asset bubbles never end well. The latest round of QE is just a case of pouring gasoline on the fire.

**Commodity prices are the canaries in the mine**

Eventually, Rosie will be right. I wrote before that today's conditions feel like

[late 2007/early 2008](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2010/12/europe-2010-subprime-2007.html)

. Tactically, we are seeing a commodity price blowoff and

[world stock markets are rallying](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2010/12/bullish-tour-around-world.html)

. For now, the path of least resistance is up.

Commodity prices are the canaries in the mine. The CRB is facing a technical hurdle of double-top resistance. How that chart pattern resolves itself is an important "tell" of where the markets move in the near term. Longer term, should any of the economic timebombs blow up, the path of commodity prices will also be an important important signal of the market direction, of whether it is a Dubai-event to be shrugged off or a Russia event that brings down the house of cards.
