    Those are the presence of excessive leverage and high valuation. The NASDAQ bubble
    that ended in 2000 was financed mainly by equity with little leverage and therefore
    the ensuing economic damage was relatively contained. By contrast, the 2008 downturn
    was financed by excessive leverage caused by real estate speculation. That result
    was a global financial crisis that the world is still trying to recover from,
    seven years later.

    into a major bear market. In 1987, the Fed tightened into a market crash. In 2000,
    the withdrawal of Y2K liquidity may have been the spark that ended the NASDAQ
    bubble.

    as the Fed prepares to hike interest rates in mid-2015\. In the past, however,
    the first rate hike has not sparked bear markets as the negative effects of rising
    interest rates have been offset by the positive effects of an acceleration in

    who analyzed forward PE ratios instead of trailing PEs. The team at Goldman Sachs
    indicated that current SPX forward PE of 16.7 is high by historical standards,
    but the median forward PE of 17.6 is even higher as it in the top 2% of history
    from 1976.

    interest rates are very low compared to the study period shown by Paulsen and
    Goldman Sachs. While market multiples aren`t low by historical standards, stocks
    can continue to rise as long as earnings continue to rise. The analysis from Wells
    Capital Management showed that the market was expensive in 2005 across the board
    as well, but the market did not peak several years later. The grey bars depict
    the PE valuation percentiles (a low percentile is expensive compared to its own
    history) in 2005 and the black bars in 2014.

    carefully how forward EPS estimates change in the near future. This chart from
    John Butters at Factset (annotations in red are mine) show that past pauses in
    EPS growth have coincided with either corrections or bear markets. I believe that
    forward EPS should get revised upwards soon because of the boost from lower oil
    prices, but we need to see how that evolves as I am cognizant of the fact that
    US large caps are vulnerable to the negative effects of a rising USD (see my recent

    in the world sparking a financial crisis. Not all financial crisis spread and
    cause bear markets. For example, the market shrugged off the Dubai default of
    2010, which occurred during a period when the financial system was still frail

    China has always been a wildcard, largely because its economy is so opaque. I
    believe that China risks are relatively low in the medium term as the current
    regime has undertaken to enact reforms. Should the Chinese economy really tank,
    Beijing have also shown the flexibility to stimulate and kick the can down the
    road. That strategy works as long as the road is long - and it seems to be at
    the moment.
