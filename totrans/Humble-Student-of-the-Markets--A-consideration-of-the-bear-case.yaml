    Those are the presence of excessive leverage and high valuation. The NASDAQ bubble
    that ended in 2000 was financed mainly by equity with little leverage and therefore
    the ensuing economic damage was relatively contained. By contrast, the 2008 downturn
    was financed by excessive leverage caused by real estate speculation. That result
    was a global financial crisis that the world is still trying to recover from,
    seven years later.

    bubble.
