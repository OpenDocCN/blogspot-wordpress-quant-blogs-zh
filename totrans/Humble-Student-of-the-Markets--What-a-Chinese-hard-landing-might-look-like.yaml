    right steps in the right direction. Open up the economy to more market forces
    as a way of reducing the domination of the SOEs on the economy and to end the
    financial repression of the household sector; rural land reform and the ending
    of the one-child policy as a way to squeeze more out of the labor force; and political
    and administrative reform to reduce the effects of corruption and crony capitalism.
    These steps are all to be lauded, but in the context of a growing investment and
    credit bubble, they may be too little too late.

    role”](http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2013-11/12/c_132882172.htm) in

    growth has been driven by unsustainable overinvestment](http://blogs.cfr.org/geographics/2012/12/05/laborchina/).
    Since growth in recent years has slowed virtually to match the 7.5% target that
    had been set for 2012 and 2013, we doubt that a 7% target can be met over the
    coming several years without the government steering lending and investment even
    more aggressively towards manufacturing and construction, where the bubble-evidence
    is most compelling.

    to re-focus growth to the Chinese consumer, relative wages would remain sticky
    upwards and Chinese labor would become less competitive compared to its global
    counterparts. Such a scenario would be incredibly bullish for the American economy.
    With commodity prices falling, which imply lower input prices and higher profit
    margins, and more competitive labor rates, which imply more onshoring of production
    and a boost for the US consumer, a Chinese hard landing could conceivably spark
    an American Renaissance.'

    rates fall because of mass unemployment and falling consumer inflation rates and
    make Chinese production more competitive. In that case, American corporate bottom

    from a collapse in the Chinese economy and financial system, another impossible
    to forecast effect is how risk premiums would be affected in the wake of such
    a crisis. We saw in the May-September period when the emerging market economies
    caught a case of "Taperitis", risk premiums on EM bonds surged and several EM
    countries were on the verge of a currency crisis. Should China experience a hard
    landing, what would happen to EM risk premiums? If they were to skyrocket, can
    we be assured that no TBTF bank isn't exposed to EM bond markets and currencies
    in a way that would cause a Lehman-like panic?
