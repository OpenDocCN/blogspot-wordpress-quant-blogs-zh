# Humble Student of the Markets: How the Election held the market hostage

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2020/10/how-election-held-market-hostage.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2020/10/how-election-held-market-hostage.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models**

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post,

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The

**Trend Asset Allocation Model**

is an asset allocation model which applies trend following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or contraction (bearish)?"

My inner trader uses a

**trading model**

, which is a blend of price momentum (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa). Subscribers receive real-time alerts of model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of the email alerts are updated weekly

. The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that began in March 2016 is shown below.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Sell equities*
*   Trend Model signal: Neutral*
*   Trading model: Bearish*

**The stealth hostage taker**

For several months, the market has been gripped by a stealth hostage crisis. The uncertainty of a contested election has gripped the market, and risk premiums have spiked as a result. 

The fever seems to be partially fading. Google searches for "contested election" have fallen dramatically.

I have also been monitoring option market's implied volatility (IV) since late September. For much of this period, IV spiked just after the election, and remained elevated into mid-December and beyond. 

These unusual option market conditions have created confusion among traders, which can lead to erroneous interpretations of market sentiment.
