# Magmasystems Blog: The Coral8 Community

> 来源：[http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2008/06/coral8-community.html#0001-01-01](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2008/06/coral8-community.html#0001-01-01)

During the Coral8 dinner the other night, I told Terry Cunningham that a stronger sense of community would help their product. There are two things that I would like to see:

1) An annual user conference. This can coincide with the annual Gartner Conference on CEP. This year's Gartner conference is in Stamford, Connecticut, which is very close to all of the Wall Street firms (and the home to many hedge funds).

One of the Coral8 customers at the dinner was extoling the virtues of Parallel Queries. Another user was giving tricks and tips for pumping in massive amounts of data into Coral8\. Plus, some of the non-financial customers of Coral8 are doing some pretty cool things with event processing. There are a number of compelling stories that can be told at a users conference.

2) A user forum on the Coral8 website.

Oh ... and a full-time New York-based sales engineer would be fantastic, but I know that Coral8 is working hard on that. However, you need to be able to pass Mark's tech screening, so study up!
