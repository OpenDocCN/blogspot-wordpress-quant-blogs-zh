    [Gustav](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Gustav) became a tropical
    storm, then a [hurricane](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/hurricanes),
    and is now back to being a tropical storm – at least for the time being. Most
    models have Gustav reaching hurricane strength again later today, perhaps as soon
    as the next [National Hurricane Center](http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/) (NHC) update,

    positions facing an uphill battle against time decay in the current highly speculative
    environment. As a result, spreads and short volatility plays should look more
    attractive as alternatives.
