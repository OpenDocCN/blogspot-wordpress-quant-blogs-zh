    “[Beating the Averages](http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html)” some time ago. So
    I was intrigued to read his [thoughts on philosophy](http://www.paulgraham.com/philosophy.html),
    and gratified to discover he was a philosophy undergrad himself, as I was. His
    essay reminded me of Freddie Ayer’s opening to Language, Truth & Logic: “The traditional
    pursuits of philosophers are, for the most part, as unwarranted as they are unfruitful”.'

    since I think the most basic question of metaphysics & ontology – “what kind of
    things are there ?” – is the same question we ask ourselves when embarking on
    a new design. So software design is applied ontology.

    whose adherents kick up a load of dust, then complain they can’t see”.'

- en: I think Graham’s problem with philosophy stems from the fact that he started
    with it. It’s probably better to master a technical discipline, then philosophize
    about it – witness Taleb, Soros, Niederhoffer on markets. Or Naur on computing.
