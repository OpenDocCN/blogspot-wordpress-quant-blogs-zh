    indicator,flashed a sell signal several days ago as it retreated from an overbought
    reading into neutral territory. This "should" have pushed the index down further,
    especially with the slightly hawkish tone from the Fed today. The logical initial
    support level is the mid-Bollinger Band, or 20 day moving average (dma), which
    is rising quickly but current stands at 2140\. The next support would the the
    breakout level at about 2120.

    the market below the tight consolidation range. A market with a weaker tone would
    have fallen to at least test the initial support level, but it hasn't. The key
    question for traders is, "Is this consolidation or corrective period over?"
