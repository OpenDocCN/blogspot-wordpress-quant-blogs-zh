- en: The last few days have certainly been scary for those who were heavily long. Knowing
    how to handle these kind of situations is what separates the men from the boys.
    As the market started turning south in the very early stages Jeff Pietsch of Market
    Rewind highlighted the importance of hedging [http://marketrewind.blogspot.com/2010/01/portfolio-x-ray-keeping-dubble-out-of.html](http://marketrewind.blogspot.com/2010/01/portfolio-x-ray-keeping-dubble-out-of.html). The
    ETF Rewind exposure tool mentioned in the article is something that all the best
    hedge funds like  Renaissance Technologies use on a daily basis to reduce risk and
    stay consistent.  Another great example comes from  Charles Kirk [http://www.thekirkreport.com/](http://www.thekirkreport.com/) who
    is another veteran market pro. I really like how he handled things and it struck
    me as being very sensible. Charles had *trailing stops on all of his positions*
    which is something he always emphasizes as a key risk management tool to preserve
    profits and protect you from big losses.  He happened to get stopped out during
    this pullback–finding himself sitting on a lot of cash. He took a day off to reflect
    and think about what to do next and came out with a special report the next day after
    spending a long time collecting his thoughts. This disciplined, common-sense approach
    is a timeless quality of all the successful market speculators of the past like
    Nicholas Darvas and William O’Neil.

    was lucky/fortunate enough to have a couple winning days during this period. As
    a consequence perhaps I can offer some simple and objective advice:'

    what you wished you did etc. A soldier in the middle of a war would have no time
    or use for recriminations and neither should you.

    P/L you have or currently had are irrelevant. Make the best decision for the present.
    The market is oversold in the short-term, if you were a short-term swing trader
    you would be long here and waiting to sell on a bounce. If you are holding a concentrated
    portfolio of risky stocks, swap that out for a position in a major index like
    the QQQQ to avoid catastrophic losses and wait to sell on that bounce.

    up take an index position to play the upside. If the market and your favorite
    stocks threaten to break new highs you can now set some buy targets. THIS TIME
    make sure to set initial and trailing stops.

    still technically in a bull market– the S&P500 is above its 200ma and the trend is
    still higher(200ma is still rising).

    a matter of time until this happens, and this correction could be the start of
    a move that reaches this point.

    Golden Cross a 50sma/200 sma crossover. This is your official signal that the
    game is over and the bear has truly returned.

    or near the 200sma AND the VIX is very low compared to all readings over the past
    year the market is vulnerable for correction.  This is a time to purchase cheap
    puts or out of the money calls on the VIX to protect your long positions IN ADDITION
    to having trailing stops.

    is near/at/or goes above 70 which happened on January 11th and gave you plenty
    of time. Previous corrections this year have followed the market reaching these
    levels. My recommendation is to use ETF Rewind’s exposure tool tool to sell short
    the appropriate ETFs to balance your risk so you are only exposed to alpha–the
    outperformance of your favorite stocks versus the market, instead of being exposed
    to the monster that is the market beta when things go south.
