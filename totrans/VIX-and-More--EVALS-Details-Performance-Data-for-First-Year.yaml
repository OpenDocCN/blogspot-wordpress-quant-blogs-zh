    Newsletter](http://vixandmoresubscriber.blogspot.com/) and [EVALS](http://vixandmoreevals.blogspot.com/)
    to an absolute minimum in this space, but lately EVALS has become such a phenomenon
    that I decided it would be easier to discuss it here rather than to continue to
    the answer the large volume of questions about this service that inevitably clog
    up my inbox.

    recommend that readers who are interested in more information visit the [EVALS
    blog](http://vixandmoreevals.blogspot.com/) and start with today’s post, [EVALS
    One Year Summary and Performance Update (+74.13%)](http://vixandmoreevals.blogspot.com/2012/12/evals-one-year-summary-and-performance.html).

    ETPs. In the first year of operation, the EVALS model portfolio traded 12 different
    VIX and volatility-based ETPs a total of 81 times. Some 63.6% of all closed trades
    were winners and the average winner gained 5.4 times as much as the average loser
    lost, with a median holding period of 60 days.

    Sharpe ratio of 1.65 in the first year, a Sortino ratio of 2.39 and a Schwager
    Gain to Pain ratio of 2.91\. More information and performance data can be found
    on the [EVALS blog](http://vixandmoreevals.blogspot.com/). Also of interest may
    be the following equity curve, which shows the one-year performance of a hypothetical
    model portfolio consisting of $100,000 that was invested in EVALS and the S&P
    500 on the November 17, 2011 launch date.

    is in the newsletter and what finds its way to the blog, I have updated what I
    call the content pyramid, which hopefully will be (mostly) self-explanatory.
