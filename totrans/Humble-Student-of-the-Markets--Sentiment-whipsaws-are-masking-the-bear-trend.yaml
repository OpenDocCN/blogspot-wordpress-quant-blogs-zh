    to changes in the USD. The S&P 500 has shown a close inverse correlation to the
    greenback. Now that the USD has decisively violated trend line support, does that
    mean that it's time for investors to stampede into a risk-on trade?

    major central banks, which would narrow interest rate differentials and weaken
    the dollar? Will other central banks out-hawk the Fed?
