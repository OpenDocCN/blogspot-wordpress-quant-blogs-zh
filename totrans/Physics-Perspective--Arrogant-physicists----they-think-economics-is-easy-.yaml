- en: . It's a fair question, and I suppose it must seem strange -- perhaps irritating
    -- to see people interloping from a foreign field, fully convinced that they'll
    be able to help out even without formal economics training. Chris thinks the physicists
    often believe, mistakenly, that they're mathematically superior to economists,
    and so might be able to sort out some big problems quite easily.
