- en: The recent run up of commodity prices such as wheat, corn, and oil, have made
    many people very wealthy. Just being long these assets has generated large returns.
    As one might expect, there has been an explosion in funds that specialize in commodities.

    that the average commodity fund performance has been pretty good. And given that
    commodity prices have risen steadily over the past 4 years, these funds must have
    been net long commodities, on average. Over the past 60 months, if we assumed
    oil should rise at the risk free rate, we experienced a 1 in 5000 event as prices
    have risen over 3 fold. So clearly, many fund managers in this space have merely
    been long, and rewarded considerably. Smart or lucky? I'm sure a little of both,
    but mostly the latter.

    used to work with this guy Ryan Gilbertson (don't know him well, but he is as
    described in the article, quite the cowboy), who is now CFO of Northern Oil &
    Gas. As he told

    about oil. But he says Northern will succeed because he and Reger weren't in business
    during the busts of earlier decades, so they aren't gun-shy today.

    they could, even as prices rose.

- en: So basically, he's saying they are successful (risen 300% in past year and a
    half), because they have just been more aggressive out of ignorance. This reminds
    me of a paper by DeLong, Shfleiffer, Summers, and Waldeman (Noise Trader risk
    in financial markets,1990), where less informed investors earn the highest (and
    lowest) rates of return on their total portfolios because they irrationally believe
    they have a more favorable risk-return opportunity and hence invest in securities
    with a higher return. In effect, their ignorance effectively diminishes their
    risk aversion, and in the long run allows a lucky few of them to reap the financial
    rewards that would accrue to the less risk averse (one could call it the ‘Forrest
    Gump’ effect). As opposed to speculation weeding out the irrational traders and
    making only the best opinions matter, the irrational can dominate the class of
    winners.

    risk controls out the window over the past 5 years have done the best. I think
    it's like the internet bubble, or any bubble. The question you have to ask is,
    is this 1998 (big up year ahead), or 1999 (the opposite)?
