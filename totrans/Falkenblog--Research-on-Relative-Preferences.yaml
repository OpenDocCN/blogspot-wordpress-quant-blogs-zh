- en: An economist at the University of Bonn has shown that test subjects who receive
    a given reward for a task enjoy it significantly more if other subjects fail or
    do worse—a finding that upends traditional economic theories that absolute reward
    is a person’s central motivation.

- en: Despite the importance of distinguishing the roles of absolute and relative
    income levels for subjective well-being, and thus for human decision-making, the
    underlying neurobiological basis of social comparison is not well understood...Similarly,
    context dependency of ventral striatal responses in humans has been demonstrated
    with fMRI...Our study introduces two critical new aspects of relative reward processing
    in the ventral striatum. First, it shows that social context is an important factor
    for reward processing. Second, in contrast to previous studies, the differences
    in reward activation cannot be explained by a mismatch between expected and received
    reward.

- en: Students in the award treatment were offered a congratulatory card from the
    organization honoring the best performance. The award was purely symbolic in order
    to ensure that any behavioral effect is driven by non-material benefits. Our results
    show that students in the award treatment outperform students in the control treatment
    by about 12 percent on average.
