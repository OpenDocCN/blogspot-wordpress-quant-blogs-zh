    June and went to a “deflation” reading in early August, in the space of about
    five weeks. Financial markets were already tanking during the July transition
    period when the model reading was “neutral”. As the model went to “deflation”
    signal, the markets panicked and went into freefall because of the Lehman crisis
    and virtual all asset classes got clobbered.

    US Treasuries during the Lehman crisis and then rotated back into risky asset
    classes as the crisis ebbed, I remain concerned about the current backdrop of
    market psychology and macro-economic landscape. Today, we have a similar situation
    where model readings are potentially transitioning quickly from an “inflation”
    to “deflation” reading, which is highly unusual, and financial markets are jittery
    and under stress.

    have very specific implications. In medicine, an Aunt Minnie is a particular set

    disease, even if each of the individual symptoms might be fairly common. Last
