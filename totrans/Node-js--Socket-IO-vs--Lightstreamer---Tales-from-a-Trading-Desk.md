Lightstreamer take an interesting [tack](http://blog.lightstreamer.com/2013/05/benchmarking-socketio-vs-lightstreamer.html) with Node.js, and provide a view of Socket.IO vs Lightstreamer, offering the view that features and performance are a reason to consider such and option.  Curious to see if any of the other web streaming contenders take a similar approach with Node.js
