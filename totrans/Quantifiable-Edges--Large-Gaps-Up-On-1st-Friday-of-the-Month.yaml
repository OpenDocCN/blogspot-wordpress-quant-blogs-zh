- en: The employment report nornally comes out on the 1st Friday of the month.  Today's
    report is helping to trigger a large gap up in the SPY.  I looked back at other
    times since 2003 where the SPY gapped up more than 1% on the first Friday of the
    month.

- en: Results here are a little dissapointing in that they don't seem to suggest much
    of an edge in either direction.  Also a little surprising is that the employment
    report hasn't triggered more big gaps up.  In any case, I'll keep this test in
    mind in the future in case a more definite edge appears to emerge, but I'm not
    basing any trades on it right now.
