    used commodity prices as the canaries in the coalmine of global growth and asset
    inflationary expectations. True, the CRB Index has staged an upside breakout and
    has been in an uptrend since early July, but some of the upside in the commodity
    complex can be explained by the rally in agricultural products because of the
    drought.

    clear path to get the ECB to the printing press promised land. If so, it is a
    very, very big game-changer. As I have stated often, if the ECB becomes the Fed,
    then the deflation fear trade, and all of its main consequences (e.g., indiscriminate
    government bond buying), are over, and the next big idea is going to be inflation.

    but that is where we are heading. Certainly, all those people who are concerned
    about deflation due to a banking and government bond market collapse in Europe
    will stop worrying about those things and will unwind positions put on to protect
    them from what they used to be afraid of.

    of the ECB's transformation. However, there is no guarantee the Europeans won't
    be able to bumble along for a while until there is another crisis that forces
    their hand. Nevertheless, the bottom line is that, either willingly or because
    it is being forced by markets, the ECB is developing the rationalization and techniques
    it will use to become the Fed.
