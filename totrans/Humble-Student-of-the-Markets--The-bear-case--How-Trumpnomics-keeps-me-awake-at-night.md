# Humble Student of the Markets: The bear case: How Trumpnomics keeps me awake at night

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2016/12/the-bear-case-how-trumpnomics-keeps-me.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2016/12/the-bear-case-how-trumpnomics-keeps-me.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models**

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post, 

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The 

**Trend Model**

 is an asset allocation model which applies trend following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or contraction (bearish)?"

My inner trader uses the 

**trading component**

 of the Trend Model to look for changes in direction of the main Trend Model signal. A bullish Trend Model signal that gets less bullish is a trading "sell" signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading "buy" signal. The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. Past trading of the trading model has shown turnover rates of about 200% per month.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Buy equities*
*   Trend Model signal: Risk-on*
*   Trading model: Bullish*

*The performance chart and model readings have been delayed by a week out of respect to our paying subscribers.* **Update schedule**

: I generally update model readings on my

 on weekends and tweet mid-week observations at @humblestudent. Subscribers will also receive email notices of any changes in my trading portfolio.

**Trumponomics: The bear case**

In last week's post (see

[How Trumponomics could push the SPX to 2500 and beyond](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/12/17/how-trumponomics-could-push-the-sp-500-to-2500/)

), I laid out the bull case for stocks under a Trump administration and how stock prices could appreciate 20% in 2017, assuming everything goes right. This week, I outline the bear case, or how Trumponomics keeps me awake at night.

Candidate Trump has said many things on the campaign trail, some of which are contradictory. President-elect Trump's cabinet is taking shape and we are now getting some hints about policy direction. Nevertheless, there are a number of contradictions in his stated positions whose unexpected side-effects that could turn out to be equity bearish:

*   Legislative tax cut disappointment 
*   A contradiction in fiscal policy vs. trade policy
*   Geopolitical friction with China
*   Rising geopolitical risk
*   Loss of market confidence
*   A possible collision course with the Federal Reserve

In this post, I will discuss each of these points, and I will end on how I believe these contradictions are likely to be resolved by the market.
