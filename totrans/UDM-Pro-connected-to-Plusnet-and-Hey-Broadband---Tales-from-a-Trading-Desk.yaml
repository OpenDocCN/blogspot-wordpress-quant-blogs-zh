    my area of the woods, Three weeks ago, I‚Äôve finally had the fibre installed into
    my house but took a few weeks to resolve the connectivity issues üò¶ Here‚Äôs a summary
    to help anyone else following in my footsteps:'

- en: I‚Äôve been running with [Plusnet](https://www.plus.net/) broadband for a long
    time. The broadband comes in on a copper phone line, into an OpenReach bridge,
    and from the bridge to a Plusnet 4 port router. Previously I had the router connected
    into Port9 (default) of the UDM Pro (WAN). This works fine, until you decide you
    want a static IP address, at which point you need to connect the OpenReach bridge
    directly into WAN which is the default Port9, and go via the UDM Pro dashboard,
    settings/internet, select Default (WAN) and in the advance section, select manual,
    and for IPv4 Connection select PPPoE, and sent the Plusnet username and password.
    This should allow the [UDM Pro](https://store.ui.com/collections/unifi-network-unifi-os-consoles/products/udm-pro)
    to PPPoE to Plusnet.

    Fibre install, and get a bearing on the quality of service. Plusnet has delivered
    a good quality of service over the last n years, but doesn‚Äôt offer fibre in my
    area.

    model, which in non bridge install, would connect to a wifi router. I opted for
    bridge mode, with a static IP, and therefore didn‚Äôt need the wifi router. UDM
    Pro Port10 (WAN2) is the port that requires the ethernet cable from Fibre bridge
    modem. Once this is connected, UDM Pro dashboard, settings/internet, select Backup
    (WAN2) advance settings needs to have PPPoE enabled, with the appropriate username
    and password. If you want to view the logs whilst the PPPoE is enabled, SSH into
    the UDM Pro from any machine on your LAN, and tail /var/log/message. You may also
    want to ifconfig and route -n to check the interface is setup as expected on a
    successful connection. Errors I experience during the initial setup of the service
    ranged from failing to find remote host, Unsupported address family, Misformatted
    DNS reply and Unable to complete PPPoE Discovery'

    with IP addresses above the Gateway IP. You should be able to run Speed Tests
    for both internet connections (WAN/WAN2) from the UDM Pro dashboard (bottom right),
    by selecting WAN or WAN2 and then selecting Speed Test.

- en: I ran into two issue during the overall install of fibre. Hey!Broadband hasn‚Äôt
    setup the bridge modem correctly. I diagnosed this by using a laptop, and PPPoE‚Äôd
    to the bridge modem, and reporting the issues I saw. Post a successful PPPoE connecting,
    I saw DNS resolution issues on the bridge modem or further back into Hey!Broadband‚Äôs
    network. Reporting this to TechSupport resolve the issue at 6.40am the following
    morning ‚Äì effectively they assigned me a new static IP

- en: Between a successful PPPoE connection, and resolved DNS issues, I wanted the
    OpenReach PPPoE to work from Port10 (WAN2), since it was going to be the failover.
    The reason for this turned out to be that Port10 can‚Äôt downgrade to 100Mb, which
    is the max connection the OpenReach bridge can achieve. Effectively I now had
    Port9 (WAN) Plusnet, and Port10(WAN2) Hey!Broadband Fibre, which is the wrong
    way around from a failover, and default UDM Pro setup. To resolve this I went
    into the UDM Pro [Port Management](https://help.ui.com/hc/en-us/articles/360008365334-UniFi-Configure-Port-Remapping),
    and swapped WAN to Port10 and WAN2 to Port9\. Solved

- en: With the above failover configuration in place, PPPoE connected, but the DNS
    issues unresolved, the UDM Pro failed over to WAN2, and the slower Plusnet broadband.
    Sometimes between 1am and 6:40am, Hey!Broadband resolve the DNS/PPPoE issues,
    and UDM Pro failed back to WAN.
