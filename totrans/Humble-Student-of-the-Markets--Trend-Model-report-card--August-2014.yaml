    asset allocation, model which uses trend following techniques as applied to commodity
    and global stock market prices to generates a composite Risk-On/Risk-Off signal
    (risk-on, risk-off or neutral). I have begun updating readers on the Trend Model
    signals on a weekly basis (for the last comment, see

    of the signal, which are indicated by the arrows, overlaid on top of a chart of
    the SP 500\. You can think of the blue up arrows, which occurred when the trend
    signal changed from negative to positive, as buy signals and the red down arrows,
    which occurred when the trend signal changed from positive to negative, as sell
    signals. Note that this is a real-time (not back-tested) signal record.

    interesting, there is no substitute for actual performance. As a proof of concept,
    I started to manage a small (about 100K) account that traded long, inverse and
    leveraged ETFs on the major US market averages and, on occasion, sector and industry
    ETFs. Trading decisions were based on Trend Model signals combined with some short-term
    sentiment indicators. The inception date of the account was September 30, 2013
    and the chart below represents an interim report card of that account.

    is intended to be an absolute return vehicle. While I do show the SPY total return,
    which includes re-invested dividends, for illustrative purposes, the SP 500 is
    not an appropriate benchmark for measuring the performance of this modeling technique.

    which matched the SPY total return of 3.9%.  The account was up 17.2% YTD and
    31.2% from inception, which amounts to a track record of only 11 months. However,
    I would also like to point out that turnover averaged about 180%

    such as a market correction. While I cannot say that it passed the correction
    test, it seemed to scored a solid mark in its August mid-term. Market participants
    saw a minor equity market pullback in August, with the SPX down about 4%, though
    small cap stocks were down considerably more.

    market in August. The sentiment models were able to pick up critical turning points
    in the pullback by calling the top in late July (see

- en: While these results are promising, I consider the Trend Model to be untested
    by stressful markets. The stock market has more only less steadily risen in the
    test period that began in September 2013 and, though the Trend Model returns during
    the minor August pullback was encouraging, we have yet to see how this model behaves
    when the stock market undergoes the stress of either a major correction or bear
    market.
