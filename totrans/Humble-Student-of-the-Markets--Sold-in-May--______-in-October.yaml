    is more volatile than the rest of the economy, and it therefore accounts for a
    large part of the quarterly swings in global activity. Furthermore, the marked
    weakness of manufacturing in the middle of 2015 raised serious concerns about
    global recession risks. It therefore offers a good cross-check for our nowcast
    estimates for overall economic activity.

    is that the growth rate has now bounced to a monthly rate of 0.2 per cent, up
    from zero in 2015 Q2\. While many commentators have been worrying about industrial
    growth in China, t***he main contributor to recent fluctuations in global industrial
    growth has been the US, where the collapse in the energy sector, and inventory
    shedding in the manufacturing sector, have had a marked effect. As these negative
    impacts on growth have faded, the global industrial sector has bounced back a
    little, which is reassuring.***
