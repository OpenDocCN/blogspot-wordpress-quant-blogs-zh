    which looked at [Implied Volatility of DJIA Components: Now vs. 52 Week High](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/09/implied-volatility-for-djia-components.html),
    received enough interest to warrant a follow-up that examines the current [implied
    volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/implied%20volatility)
    vs. the 52 week high IV of the 19 financial institutions which were subjected

    to their 52 week implied volatility highs, with GM omitted. While not captured
    in the graphic, I find it interesting that the two institutions whose current
    IV is the lowest compared to the high IV are Morgan Stanley ([MS](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/MS))
    at 12.7% of the 52 week high and Goldman Sachs ([GS](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/GS))
    at 18.9% of the 52 week high. Those institutions whose current IV is closest to
    the 52 week high (in percentage terms) are BB&T ([BBT](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/BBT))
    at 36.3% and Regions Financial ([RF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/RF))
    at 34.6%.

    it appears as if the investment banks are healthiest and have shed the most risk,
    while regional banks have undergone a much more measured healing process – about
    what one might expect. Clearly this is a story of multiple different pathways
    back to financial health.
