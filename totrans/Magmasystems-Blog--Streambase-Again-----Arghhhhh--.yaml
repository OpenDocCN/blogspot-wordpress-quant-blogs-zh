- en: on Streambase's recent customer win has gotten some people pretty ticked off.
    I have received some private messages from a few of the CEP vendors who are crying
    foul. Nobody wants to appear that they have sour grapes against the Streambase
    win, but of course by contacting me, they know that I will pursue the issue in
    the interest of fairness and transparency.

    that Phase Capital had evaluated all of the major CEP vendors. Penny had written
    the following:'

    [Progress Apama](http://www.progress.com/apama), [Coral8](http://www.coral8.com/),
    [Aleri](http://www.aleri.com/) and [StreamBase](http://www.streambase.com/).What
    some of the CEP vendors are claiming is that Phase Capital had never downloaded
    copies of their products for evaluation, nor contacted the CEP vendor with any
    questions.

    you need to fill out a registration form. Some of the CEP vendors won't even let
    you download a copy from their website ... they want to pre-certify you by paying
    you a personal visit.

    some of the products. Did they do part of their evaluation from going over a publically
    available list of features? Did they get information from blogs such as this one?
    Did they download the product under another name? Did they have a third-party
    consultant do the evaluations?

    and Technology to ask his writer, Penny Crossman, to substantiate what she wrote
    in her article concerning the competitive evaluation that Phase Capital did between
    the various CEP products. Penny is the designated beat reporter for the CEP industry,
    so I would like to see a bit of investigative journalism from her on this matter.
    Otherwise, serious doubts would still remain as to Phase Capital's evaluation
    process.
