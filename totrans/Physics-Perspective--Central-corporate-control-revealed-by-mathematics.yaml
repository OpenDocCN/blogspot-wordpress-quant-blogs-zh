    contacted by *New Scientist* say it is a unique effort to untangle control in
    the global economy. Pushing the analysis further, they say, could help to identify
    ways of making global capitalism more stable.

    Institute of Technology in Zurich, is the first to go beyond ideology to empirically
    identify such a network of power. It combines the mathematics long used to model
    natural systems with comprehensive corporate data to map ownership among the world's
    transnational corporations (TNCs).

    and this is a beautiful piece of work. If you know a little about natural complex
    networks, then the structures found here actually aren't terrifically surprising.
    However, they are interesting, and it's very important to have the structure documented
    in detail. Moreover, just because the structure observed here is very common in
    real world complex networks doesn't mean its something that is good for society.
