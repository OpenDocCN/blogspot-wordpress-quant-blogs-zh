    ushered in a new era of highly liquid trading vehicles with narrow bid-ask spreads
    and exceptionally high intraday volatility. When FINRA (Financial Industry Regulatory
    Authority) implemented [more stringent margin requirements](http://www.finra.org/web/groups/industry/@ip/@reg/@notice/documents/notices/p119906.pdf)
    for leveraged ETFs back on December 1, 2009, some of the luster came off of these
    products, particularly for the day trading crowd.

    ETN ([VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX)) earlier in 2009,
    I thought it was just a matter of time before VXX became part of that elite group
    of nitroglycerin-fueled fueled rocket pairs that were led by [FAS](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/FAS)
    and [FAZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/FAZ) and supported by [TNA](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TNA)
    and [TZA](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TZA). Sure enough, interest
    in VXX surged in December 2009 and by January the ETN was eclipsing the daily
    volume of all but FAS and FAZ.

    of an inverse pair that would make it easier to go long and short volatility without
    having to short VXX and deal with “availability to short” issues.

    (the Barclays ETN+ Inverse S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN) is proof that VXX
    now has a viable inverse counterpart, with bid-ask spreads and liquidity that
    make it an attractive day trading vehicle. XXV traded 715,872 shares today, reaching
    that volume level in one third the time it took to attract the same interest.
    VXX took almost four months to reach one million shares in a single session; my
    guess is that XXV hits that mark before the week is through.

    VXX, it should be noted that in its first two weeks, XXV has underperformed a
    comparable short VXX position in all but one trading session.
