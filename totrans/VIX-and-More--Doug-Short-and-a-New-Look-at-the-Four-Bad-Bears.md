# VIX and More: Doug Short and a New Look at the Four Bad Bears

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/08/doug-short-and-new-look-at-four-bad.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/08/doug-short-and-new-look-at-four-bad.html#0001-01-01)

While we are waiting to see what the FOMC has to say, I thought I would use this lull to highlight the work of [Doug Short](http://www.dshort.com/), which can be found at [dshort.com](http://dshort.com/).

Yesterday, in [The Road to Recovery](http://www.dshort.com/articles/2009/road-to-recovery.html), Doug looked at the profile of recoveries from four strong bear markets. Given the relative ease with which stocks have recovered from their March lows (see chart below), Doug adopts a skeptical tone (which I share) about the path forward for stocks:

> *“Our current market is now 47% above the March 9th low. It has significantly outperformed the 1974 and 2002 rebounds over the equivalent period, and it briefly surpassed the 48% rally in the 1929 Dow. Will it continue to show resilience?”*

For a related post and graphic that puts the above in a different perspective, readers are encouraged to check out Doug’s [The “Real” Mega-Bear Quartet 2000](http://dshort.com/articles/2009/mega-bear-2000.html).
