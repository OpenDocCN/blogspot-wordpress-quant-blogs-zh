- en: A trolley has lost its brakes, and is about to crash into 5 workers at the end
    of the track. You find that you just happen to be standing next to a side track
    that veers into a sand pit, potentially providing safety for the trolley's five
    passengers. However, along this offshoot of track leading to the sandpit stands
    a man who is totally unaware of the trolley's problem and the action you're considering.
    There's no time to warn him. So by pulling the lever and guiding the trolley to
    safety, you'll save the five passengers but you'll kill the man.

    a bridge under which it will pass, and you can stop it by dropping a heavy weight
    in front of it. As it happens, there is a very fat man next to you – your only
    way to stop the trolley is to push him over the bridge and onto the track, killing
    him to save five. Should you proceed?

- en: I think a good resolution is that in the second case there is a significant
    probability that one does not save the 5 men, and instead merely kills the fat
    man. I've never pushed a fat man in front of a trolley, but I suspect most would
    simply run right over him and keep going. In the first case, if you  killed the
    one man you definitely save the five men, it's not possible to kill both the one
    man and the five men by switching tracks. In the other case the probability is
    clearly less than 1, perhaps only 0.1\. That's the difference. As a rule, acting
    on a theory and killing x people with certainty to perhaps save 5x people is morally
    wrong, mainly because these theories are often wrong, so all you do is kill x
    people (eg, a lot of evil is legitimized as breaking eggs to make an omelette,
    but then there's no omelette). The move from certainty to mere 'highly likely
    in my judgment' is huge.
