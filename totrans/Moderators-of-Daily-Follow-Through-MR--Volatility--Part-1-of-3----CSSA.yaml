- en: Today we will take a look at one of the different factors that affect the performance
    of a standard daily follow-through mean-reversion strategy. As a refresher, the
    strategy assumes that you buy after down days, and go short after up days. Since
    early 2000, mean-reversion following up or down days has been the dominant paradigm
    in financial markets–especially for the broad market indexes. This is also a very
    good proxy for how well other short-term MR indicators such as RSI2 or DV2 will
    perform under similar circumstances.

    a look at implied volatility as well. Finally, in subsequent posts, i will combine
    these factors to have a better understanding of their impact on classic daily
    follow-through MR. Broadly, this series of posts will also cover the impact of
    volume as well as the impact of trend strength or R-squared. I will combine all
    of these factors to create a matrix that helps better predict when to bet on mean-reversion
    and when to bet on continuation from today’s closing direction in the market.
    This will help disentangle the sources of MR returns, and also broaden our understanding
    of how today’s market is functioning.

    follow-through MR.  I used 3000 bars of data on the SPY (S&P500) as a test sample
    ending last week. I classified high volatility as being in the 75th percentile,
    and low volatility as being in the 25th percentile, both with a lookback of 1-year.
    Average volatility was anything that fell in between those two levels. For comparison,
    i used both 10-day and 100-day historical volatility. Here are the results:'

    daily follow-through MR strategy. In contrast, the worst environment for daily
    follow through is the average volatility environment, followed by environments
    with low volatility. 10-day volatility was a far more superior moderator of returns
    than the 100-day lookback.  It pays to wait for short-term volatility to bet on
    mean-reversion, and at present historical volatility is in the 17th percentile.
    When volatility is low, the return to following the long term trend (1-year average)
    is superior to daily follow through MR. This suggests that continuation is more
    probable than reversion on balance, even though the market is overbought on a
    variety of metrics.

    volatility was lower or higher in relation to the 100-day volatility over the
    past year in different volatility regimes. I took the 10-day minus the 100-day
    and looked at the percentile ranking of the difference over the past year (technically
    above/below average is actually the median).

- en: It seems apparent that in high volatility environments, follow-through returns
    are more consistent when the 10-day is lower in relation to the 100-day–ie you
    want to buy high volatility environments when volatility is slowing down. In contrast,
    in low volatility environments you want to buy when volatility is speeding up.
    Logically this makes sense, as it is risky to fade market direction into high
    and accelerating volatility, and also it is risky to fade extremely quiet markets
    (low volatility, low 10d/100d vol)  which are prone to major breakouts/breakdowns.

    and long-term volatility is an important moderator of daily follow through MR
    returns. A simple contigency matrix can help traders better understand when it
    is likely to work, and when it is not reliable.
