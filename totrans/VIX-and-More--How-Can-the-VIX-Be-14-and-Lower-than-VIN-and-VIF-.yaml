    why the VIX is down more than 5%, hovering around the 14.00 level, when the SPX
    is down 0.4% and all the major market averages are deeply in the red. More serious
    students of the VIX will also note that this drop in the VIX comes on a Monday,
    when the typical VIX “[calendar reversion](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/calendar%20reversion)”
    is generally responsible for about a 1% pop in the volatility index.

    VIX: the roll. Quoting directly from the source, the [CBOE Volatility Index (VIX)
    White Paper](http://www.cboe.com/micro/vix/vixwhite.pdf), we find these two important
    nuggets from pages 4 and 9, which I have presented here sequentially for easier
    consumption:'

    in the first and second SPX contract months. ‘Near-term options must have at least
    one week to expiration; a requirement intended to minimize pricing anomalies that
    might occur close to expiration. When the near-term options have less than a week
    to expiration, VIX ‘rolls’ to the second and third SPX contract months. For example,
    on the second Friday in June, VIX would be calculated using SPX options expiring
    in June and July. On the following Monday, July would replace June as the ‘near-term’
    and August would replace July as the ‘next-term.’”*'

    more than 30 days to expiration. The same formula is used to calculate the 30-day
    weighted average, but the result is an extrapolation of σ² 1 and σ² 2; i.e., the
    sum of the weights is still 1, but the near-term weight is greater than 1 and
    **the next-term weight is negative** (e.g., 1.25 and – 0.25).”* [Emphasis added]'

    and [VIF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIF) back in March 2011
    ([VIN, VIF and an Obsolete VIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2011/03/vin-vif-and-obsolete-vix.html)),
    I was stunned to learn how few investors, including savvy and experienced VIX
    fanatics, were completely unaware of these indices. At the time, the CBOE did
    not even refer to VIN and VIF on their web site, but they have since added a [splash
    page](http://www.cboe.com/micro/vin/) for these two indices, along with the following
    brief comments:'

- en: 'Getting back to the roll, the SPX options contract months roll forward one
    month today, so that the nearer-term month (VIN) moves from August to September
    and the farther-term month (VIF) moves from September to October. More importantly,
    per the bolded text from the VIX white paper above, today’s VIX calculations sum
    more than 100% of the VIN and a ***negative number*** for VIF. This is the reason
    why the VIX is less than the two components used in its calculation: VIN and VIF. 
    In summary, the bigger the difference between the VIN and the VIF (and right now
    that difference is a very large 9.4%), the more likely the VIX is going to be
    substantially depressed following the VIX roll.  Also, as we move toward the expiration
    of VIX options on August 22nd, the distortions from the negative VIF component
    used in the VIX calculations should gradually diminish, as the VIF weighting moves
    toward zero and then becomes a positive number.'

    the CBOE’s VIX White Paper is the best place to start; the links below might also
    provide additional insight.
