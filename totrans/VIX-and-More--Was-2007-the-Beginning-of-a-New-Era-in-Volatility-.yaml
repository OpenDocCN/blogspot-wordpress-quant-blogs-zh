- en: From the chart below, it certainly looks as if 2007 was the beginning of a new
    [volatility macro cycle](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20macro%20cycles).  It
    also looks as if the rate of change in volatility over the course of 2007 is unsustainable
    going forward – or at least inconsistent with the slope of volatility macro cycles
    during previous cycles.  I am not going to make a specific long-term [volatility
    forecast](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/volatility%20forecast) for
    2008, but it would not surprise me if volatility flattened out in the low to mid-20s
    range in much the same manner that it did from late 1998 to early 2002.

- en: While VIX macro cycles are somewhat dependent upon a subjective determination
    about the beginning and ending dates for each cycle, it should be noted that these
    cycles tend to last a minimum of two years, suggesting that the current rise in
    volatility should persist through all of 2008, even if the rate of rise in volatility
    begins to slow.

    watch in 2008; *VIX and More* has a front row seat to watch the action and provide
    the play-by-play and color commentary as appropriate.
