    is long-term cautious but short-term bullish, with a long-term bullish but short-term
    cautious stance. First, Belski explained his bullishness based on the thesis that
    we are seeing a secular bull market after a Lost Decade and therefore long-term
    equity return expectations of 10% are plausible (via

- en: 'Secular Bull Markets Are Born Out of Lost Decades: Based on historical evidence,
    stocks typically enter a very long period of expansion after emerging from a period
    of negative 10-year holding period returns. We found that, on average, these periods
    last for roughly 15 years and deliver average annual returns of about 16%. Given
    that 10-year holding period returns emerged from negative territory a little over
    five years ago and currently stand at 5.5%, it is not unreasonable to assume that
    there is about 10 years and 10% of average annual returns left to the current
    bull market should performance follow historical patterns.'
