    rally to test the old highs seen in the SPX. Initially, I was somewhat concerned
    that both the slope of the term structure of the VIX and the VIX Index itself
    was falling very quickly. This was leading very quickly to a short-term overbought
    condition. As the chart below shows, such behavior is typical of oversold rallies
    when the VIX term structure exits an inversion (dotted vertical lines) and bulls
    should not be concerned about the rapidity of the improvement in these indicators.

    not start with sentiment readings at such bearish levels. Barring some catastrophic

    we can look forward to possible hints of new directions in Federal Reserve policy

    breakout from an inverse head and shoulders (IHS) formation. The Ukraine tension
    related pullback Friday saw the index retreat to successfully test the neckline
    of the breakout. The measured target of the IHS is 1985, which is roughly a test
    of the old highs in the index.

- en: As a way to describe the economy, Goldilocks was formulated back in the 1990s,
    when the Fed was relatively well behaved and the economy was expanding. Today,
    I call it "Goldilocks cubed" because we have what actually may be an accelerating
    economy, with the Fed and Treasury rates well-behaved and perceptions about risk
    declining. ***Market valuations depend on growth, bond rates, and perceptions
    of risk, and all three of those are going in the direction that actually expands
    the price/earnings multiple.*** At the same time, earnings are expanding, and
    that's a recipe for another leg up in the market. In terms of economic expansion,
    we have been stuck in this 2% growth range since 2008-09\. But we think something
    has happened and that animal spirits have returned. We've had these sky-is-falling
    moments, and every time we get through one of them, more and more people come
    out of their caves and say, "Maybe the sky is not really going to fall."
