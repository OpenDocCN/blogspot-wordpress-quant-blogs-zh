    employment should not have ballooned the way it did in the boom years and now
    the downward adjustment is going to be painful for a lot of people, many of whom
    didn't make the obscene amounts of money reported in the press.

- en: A few years ago, I managed equity market neutral portfolios at a firm that was
    mainly known for commodity trading using trend following techniques, which are
    well described by [Michael Covel](http://www.michaelcovel.com/) in his book [Trend
    Following]. During my tenure there I noticed that while the commodity positions
    were spread out among various futures contracts they often amounted to a few macro
    bets (i.e. on interest rates, on the US$, etc.) I came to the conclusion that
    ***these models were identifying macroeconomic trends that are persistent and
    exhibit serial correlation, which creates investment opportunities for patient
    long-term investors.*** For example, if the Fed is raising rates the odds are
    they will continue to raise rates until they signal a neutral or easing bias,
    i.e. there is a trend to interest rates, which is information that investors can
    use. ***The key risk in this class of models is knowing when to exit the trend,
    as short and long term reversals can be devastating to the bottom line.***
