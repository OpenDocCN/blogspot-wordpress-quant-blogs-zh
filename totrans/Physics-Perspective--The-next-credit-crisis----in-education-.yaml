    this rise has been. The figure shows two curves, red for student loan debt, blue
    for overall household debt. The latter itself went through a rather explosive
    growth from 1999-2008, yet doesn''t come close to matching the rate of growth
    in student loans:'

    average period in history for household debt. This period included the inflation
    of a housing bubble so gigantic that it caused the financial sector to collapse
    and led to the worst recession since the Great Depression. But that other debt
    growth? It's dwarfed by student loan growth.

    revolving home equity, then from the first quarter of 1999 to when housing-related
    debt peaked in the third quarter of 2008, the sum increased from $3.28 trillion
    to $9.98 trillion. Over this period, housing-related debt had increased threefold.
    Meanwhile, over the entire period shown on the chart, the balance of student loans
    grew by more than 6x. The growth of student loans has been twice as steep.

    Indiviglio goes on to ponder what happens when the bubble bursts, but there isn't
    an obvious endgame.

    high-minded aim to make education possible to ever more people but the chance
    to make an easy profit on loans guaranteed by the US government.

    up their share of the easy credit, and of course there's been an explosion in
    for-profit college companies such as the Education Management Corporation. That
    company appears to be to the education bubble what Countrywide was to the housing
    bubble -- a facilitator pushing clients into loans regardless of need, solely

    40% owned by Goldman Sachs.
