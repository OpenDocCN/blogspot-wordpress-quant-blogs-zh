    been part of this “stuff”. [Natixis](http://www.quartetfs.com/casestudies/activepivotnatixiscasestudy.pdf)
    has a case study that provides information on how it achieved real-time/intra-day
    risk coupled with P&L using various products, including [Gigaspaces](http://vehera.jsn-server7.com/LiddleBlog/?p=440).
    Like most problems, the solution is either a complete custom build, a product
    or a hybrid. I suspect however that all real-time risk solutions need an in-memory
    cube to stand any chance of delivering the data in real-time. It’s a shame Natixis’s
    case study doesn’t provide a hint as to the latency from booking a trade to seeing
    the risk update on a traders desktop.

- en: '[CEP](http://www.quartetfs.com/activepivot+real+time+olap+cube.html) also would
    appear to be important in the real-time risk space. Aleri [Live](http://www.aleri.com/products/aleri-live-olap)
    OLAP is one such product that what offers [real-time](http://www.aleri.com/solutions/capital-markets/real-time-profit-loss)
    P&L. Aleri’s CEP engine is pretty good, but I don’t have a view on their Live
    OLAP server. I believe Aleri have had the Live OLAP product for a while, hence
    it would be curious to know if they have seen an uptick over the last year. Microsoft
    might also want to consider how it positions StreamInsight given that the group
    site inside the SQL Server team – StreamInsight coupled to [Analysis Server](http://www.microsoft.com/sqlserver/2005/en/us/Analysis-Services.aspx)
    would at least put them into the Aleri Live OLAP space.'

    Buy-Side [Technology](http://db.riskwaters.com/public/showPage.html?page=867170)
    has an interesting view; “Although real-time risk management is still only possible
    in theory, the vendor has seen a large increase in interest in this area since
    the end of February. The firms looking to adopt this type of risk calculation
    are mostly large and mid-tier banks”.'
