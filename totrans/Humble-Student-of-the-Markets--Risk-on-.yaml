- en: The equity rally is part of the overall “buy risk” trade that investors have
    been engaged in for the past few months. A clue to its longevity is to look at
    other markets to see how they are faring, so that we can understand whether the
    bull or the bear is in control.

    and therefore fueled the rally in prices. Despite the crack in the Shanghai market,
    it is interesting that commodity prices, in aggregate, remain in a fragile uptrend.

    This trade is now testing its uptrend line, but until that line is breached, the
    bulls should be given the benefit of the doubt.

    property purchase in a low yielding currency like the Swiss Franc? Here is the
    Hungarian Forint/Swiss Franc exchange rate. Interestingly, FX traders had been
    in that trade since early March. It breached its uptrend line mid-August and it
    appears to be in the process of rolling over.

    are now testing their uptrend lines. If they get breached, then it is a clear
    sign that the bears have won the upper hand.
