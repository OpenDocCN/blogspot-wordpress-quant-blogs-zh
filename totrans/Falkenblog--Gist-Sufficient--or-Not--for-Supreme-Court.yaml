- en: In dissent, Justice John Paul Stevens wrote that the majority "would have us
    believe that over 200 years ago, the Framers made a choice to limit the tools
    available to elected officials wishing to regulate civilian uses of weapons";
    such evidence "is nowhere to be found." Stevens infers the second amendment allows
    laws so draconian as to be an outright ban, effectively, on having a working gun
    in your personal residence. In contrast, earlier this month the Supreme court
    ruled that the death penalty violated the prohibition on "cruel and unusual punishment".

    negate someone's right because the specifics of the prohibition are 'nowhere to
    be found' in the Constitution, even though it's clearly the gist of the second
    amendment. In another case, the government's ability to apply the death penalty
    in cases of rape are nowhere to be found, but it is implied via the vague language
    prohibiting 'cruel and unusual punishment'.

- en: I'm for abortion and guns, and think you ought to only kill those who commit
    murder (so that a rapist knows his punishment can get worse if he kills his victim),
    but that's besides the point. For some justices the second amendment can be parsed
    into a baning guns in practice because such a specific ban was not mentioned,
    but a ban on abortions is not permitted via the mention of a 'right to privacy',
    or that death penalties for non-capital offenses are implied by the phrase 'cruel
    and unusual'. It seems the Constitution's is either sufficiently vague as to grant
    a right (to have an abortion, to not allow the death penalty), or not sufficiently
    detailed as to not grant a right (to bear arms). Details are necessary, or not,
    when reading the constitution, depending on who's ox is being gored.
