    Baa bonds, riding up 3 years on the yield curve, but that's it. After that risk
    is something we take with negative expected returns, because risky assets play
    into our overconfidence, signaling, and other outside-the-box needs. (regular
    chart is the conventional academic wisdom from Cam Harvey's

    is superior to the standard Corporate Finance course you will learn in college
    or graduate school. This is because they neglect to mention the fundamental theory
    that risk and expected return are positively correlated, is an empirical failure.
    Professors have been very successful at presenting the CAPM and its spawn as a
    triumph of the social sciences, in a way similar to how macroeconomists used to
    present Keynesian macro models before the Phillips curve started to do multiple
    backflips. The profs are filled with wishful thinking based on ever more obscure
    econometric tests that prove their big idea works, a science no less than thermodynamics.
    It doesn't work, not even as an approximation. You have a finite life, don't waste
    it on theories theories popular among professors but not practitioners. Plus,
