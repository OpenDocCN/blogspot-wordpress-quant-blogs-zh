    Protect Our Gun Rights, which has raised $1.1 million and has its own measure
    on the ballot to try to block background checks.

    incremental steps to better the world with small but high impact contributions
    to worthy causes. The tragedy of gun violence in America is deplorable. However,
    your latest contribution marking an approach towards gun control political advocacy,
    regardless of your intent, cannot be regarded as a high impact act given the entrench
    gun culture in American society.

    qualified could be allowed to own a gun. Just as car ownerships are required to
    have insurance, gun owner should be required to carry a large level of liability
    insurance in case the guns under his control are used improperly.

    Insurance companies are in the business of pricing risk and they should be able
    to price the cost of gun ownership properly. That way, the market can create barriers
    to the "crazies" owning guns.

    the "right kind" of gun ownership, i.e. responsible ones, will be largely unaffected.
    In America, everyone who is qualified is allowed to own a car, but not everyone
    is owns one because of the costs involved. Under this proposal, the free market
    would tend to weed out the higher risk cases.

    have responsibilities in the operation of a vehicle and laws requiring liability
    insurance. If we apply the same principles used for cars to guns and allow the
    market to price the risk of gun ownership, it is a proposal that could see strong
    bipartisan support from both sides of the gun control debate.
