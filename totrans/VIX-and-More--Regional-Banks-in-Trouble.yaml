- en: While the first six weeks of 2009 have seen pockets of bullishness in stocks,
    one sector that has been notably absent from the occasional bursts of buying activity
    has been financials. Within the financial sector, the weakest of the weak has
    been regional banks, which will see little in the way of benefits from TARP 2.0
    and stand to lose a great deal if the consumer credit crisis continues to deepen,
    as almost everyone now expects will be the most likely scenario.

    year, the S&P 500 index has given up about half of the gains it has made since
    the November 21^(st) bottom. The regional banks, on the other hand (represented
    here by [KRE](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=KRE), an ETF), have fallen sharply
    below their November lows and are now even below the lower lows of January and
    early February.

    ahead of them. I have seen estimates that 10% or more may even fail before the
    economy can be nursed back to health.

- en: If regional banks continue to reflect deteriorating valuations, I find it hard
    to believe that the broader market will be able to shake off this concern and
    manage a significant rally. At the very least, I would expect the market to be
    no better than range bound at least until the stocks of regional banks can be
    taken off of life support.
