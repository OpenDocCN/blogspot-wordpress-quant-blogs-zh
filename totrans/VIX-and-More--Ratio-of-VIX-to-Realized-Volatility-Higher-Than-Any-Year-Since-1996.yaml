    I think it is important to add some context in the form of several observations
    about the relationship between the VIX and the [historical volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/historical%20volatility)
    (HV) of the S&P 500 index. In the absence of any information about the future,
    it turns out that historical volatility (a.k.a. [realized volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/realized%20volatility)
    or statistical volatility) can provide a reasonably accurate measure of future
    volatility. In fact, it is more difficult than one might imagine to incorporate
    information about the future to come up with a better estimate of future volatility
    than what can be gleaned just by extrapolating from recent realized volatility.

    future realized volatility. In fact, in the 23 years of VIX historical data, there
    was only one year – 2008 – in which realized volatility turned out to be higher
    than that which was predicted by the VIX.

    future volatility. From 1990-1996, for instance, the VIX overshot realized volatility
    by an average of 49%. Since 1997, the magnitude of that overshoot has dropped
    dramatically, to about 24%, as investors apparently began to realize that they
    had been overpaying for portfolio protection in particular and for options in
    general.

    10-day historical volatility in the SPX by 47% – the biggest cushion since 1996\.
    Not surprisingly, low realized volatility tends to depress the VIX and the front
    end of the VIX futures [term structure](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/term%20structure)
    in general. For that reason, the unusually low average 10-day historical volatility
    of 12.25 experienced so far in 2012 can serve as a partial explanation for the
    steepness of the VIX futures term structure (extreme [contango](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/contango))
    yet given the history of even lower volatility numbers during 2004-2007, the low
    historical volatility for 2012 is at best a very small portion of the full explanation.
    Two better potential explanations for the steep VIX futures term structure are
    the psychology of the 2008 financial crisis and its aftermath (i.e., [disaster
    imprinting](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/disaster%20imprinting),
    [availability bias](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/availability%20bias),
    the recency effect, etc.) and expectations of future higher volatility due to
    a geopolitical and macroeconomic overhang that has generated a much higher level
    of anxiety about future prospects than in more uneventful economic times. Then,
    of course, there is the issue of the role of mushrooming growth in VIX exchange-traded
    products as an influence on the VIX futures term structure.

    in this series is a discussion of the evolution of the VIX futures term structure.
