    indicator has generated buy signals. The blue lines indicate past episodes when

    and 52-week lows (red). Most recently, the new low count has spiked to extraordinarily
    high levels and then retreated. I have marked with vertical lines the past occurrences
    of this condition in the last four years. Each of those episodes were associated
    with V-shaped bottoms and subsequent rallies to new highs in the SPX.

    it would provide a good entry point for traders who missed have missed this powerful
    rally to get long.
