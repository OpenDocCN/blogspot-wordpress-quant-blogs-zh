    keystrokes and maybe even a few tweets with the compendium below.

    the graphics below originate from [LivevolPro.com](http://livevolpro.com/) and
    provide a graphical history of Apple ([AAPL](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/AAPL))
    earnings from July 2010 to the present.

    but since everyone else does and the markets have one priced in, it may be helpful
    to put the current situation into historical context.
