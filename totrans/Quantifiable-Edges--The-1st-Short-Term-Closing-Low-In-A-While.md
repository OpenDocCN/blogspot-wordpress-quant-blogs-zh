# Quantifiable Edges: The 1st Short-Term Closing Low In A While

The market had gone quite a while without a pullback before the last 2 days.  Monday, for the 1st time in a while, SPY closed at a 5-day low.  The study below looks at at other instances of SPY closing at a 5-day low after going at least 2 weeks without one.

Results here suggest a decent upside edge.
