    I think its fun to go over one article in there. Ang, Bekaert, and Wie, have an
    article called

    a theory, but a framework. A theory is a testable hypothesis, it generates predictions,
    restricts what can happen, and is testable. A framework is like string theory
    with its 10^500 different universes: one of them works!'

    really crazy from 1970-1981 when inflation was increasing and real yields were
    negative, and so a parameter that basically gets that separated helps. In a sense,
    the fact that people didn''t anticipate the increase in inflation in the 1970''s,
    or its decline in the 1980''s, is modeled via this little trick, but I don''t
    think reifying this makes it any clearer. As per regime switching in general,
    watch out: macro data has a handful of turning points: 1973 for productivity,
    1981 for inflation, the 5 recessions since 1970\. Let my model ''know'' those
    and the model y=constant works pretty well. The model is a function of three more
    parameters: the inflation rate, a ''latent'' factor, and a risk factor--the latter
    two being unobservable.'

    slope. But the upward slope of the yield curve is only for the first 1-3 years,
    so for some reason, the 'inflation risk premium' they assert that causes this
    is only applicable for 1-3 years, after that, it goes away. But they offer 1 to
    6 (!) regimes, as if, take your pick! They like that their model shows that nominal
    yields are more upward sloping than real yields, though the Treasury Inflation
    Index yields look pretty parallel to the nominal curve to my eyes. They find that
    80% of the yield curve volatility is from the inflation rate an the inflation
    risk premium, even though the 10 year TIPS rate has about 87% of the nominal rate
    since 2002 (data in FRED).

    the varying price of risk, and the regime switching, as evidence of its richness.
    When the key attractiveness of a model is that it can accommodate the data we
    all know so well with unobservables, what is the point? Inflation, fine, but latent
    factors and the time-varying risk parameters is simply the data, because there
    is very limited intuition for these, they are fit to the data. Now if they found
    they could pull out a risk factor here, and use it to explain equities, that would
    be neat. But this model is classic academic research.
