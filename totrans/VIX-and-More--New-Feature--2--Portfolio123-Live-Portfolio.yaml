    it will come as no surprise to anyone that I have an investing life outside of
    the VIX.  Frankly, I am of the opinion that where the markets are concerned, it
    is important to utilize a broad-brush approach, if not a multidisciplinary perspective,
    as is advocated so eloquently by [Michael Mauboussin](http://www.leggmason.com/funds/knowledge/mauboussin/mauboussin.asp)
    of [Legg Mason Capital Management](http://www.lmcm.com/).

    I thought I would set up a real-time example and use that opportunity to shine
    a little light on [Portfolio123](http://www.portfolio123.com/index.jsp).  My relationship
    to Portfolio123 is this: after paying a lifetime membership to [Silicon Investor](http://www.siliconinvestor.com/)
    in 1998, it wasn’t until 2004 that I ponied up another subscription fee, this
    time for Portfolio123.com.  I have been a satisfied customer ever since.  (For
    those who may be interested in kicking Portfolio123’s tires a little – and I recommend
    that you do – [Harry Domash](http://www.winninginvesting.com/) [reviewed](http://www.portfolio123.com/article041804.html)

    and will briefly update and also use as a thought starter of sorts each weekend.  The
    stock selection portion of the portfolio shares some common ancestry with P123’s
    stalwart [Balanced4](http://www.portfolio123.com/rank_details2.jsp?nodeid=0&rankid=361)
    stock ranking system.  I will provide additional details about the mechanics of
    this portfolio and system in subsequent weeks.  For now, suffice it to say that
    this is a five stock portfolio that is rebalanced each weekend; the stocks selected
    below for initial purchases are required to be priced at $10.00 or more at the
    time of purchase, trade an average of 300,000 shares per day, and have a minimum
    market capitalization of $250 million.
