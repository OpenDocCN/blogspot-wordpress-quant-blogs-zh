- en: Here is a real head scratcher that`s been bothering me for the past several
    weeks. I have had a number of discussions with investment professionals and I
    have had no satisfactory answer. Why does the NAAIM survey of equity exposure
    experience such wild swings (chart via

- en: As the chart shows, the NAAIM equity exposure index has swung wildly from under
    20% to over 80% in the past four years. These kind of volatility is more consistent
    with panic and euphoria of swing traders or reflect the risk tolerance of hedge
    funds than plain vanilla individual investor investment mandates.

- en: Most professional investors would have a process where they establish an investment
    objective for their client, with an asset allocation benchmark, e.g. 50% stocks,
    50% bonds. They would then vary their exposure by 5-10% around that benchmark.
    Under extreme market conditions, a typical target variance from benchmark might
    be 20% from policy weight.

- en: The wild variation of the NAAIM survey sample can be explained in two ways.
    First, it could be the result of passive drift. In a raging bull market, equity
    weights could creep up to a level way beyond target weight. Conversely, in a devastating
    bear market, equity weights could plummet to extremely low levels.

- en: As well, the swings in NAAIM equity weights could be the result of active decisions
    by the managers to buy or sell equities. However, it is hard for me to comprehend
    that in the space of last few weeks that the NAAIM managers panicked and sold
    their equity positions down to historically low levels and then panicked again
    to buy back into the stock market. Do they have a process, or are they just flying
    by the seat of their pants?

    should not have been a disaster. US large caps, as measured by the SP 500, down
    about 10% peak-to-trough and small caps seeing a substantially higher draw-down,
    but the bond market rally has offset much of those losses.
