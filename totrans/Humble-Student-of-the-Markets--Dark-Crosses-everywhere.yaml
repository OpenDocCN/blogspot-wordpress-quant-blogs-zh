- en: I reviewed many of the world's stock market charts this weekend and what I found
    were numerous Dark Crosses where the 50-day moving averaged and crossed under
    the 200 day-day moving average. These are ominous signs indicating the overall
    trend has turned south. In fact, most Dark Crosses had occurred in either June
    or July and US equities were one of the last markets to experience a Dark Cross.
    In fact, only one stock market, the Russian one, hadn't seen a Dark Cross marking
    a technical downtrend but it had experienced a pattern of broken support.

    and violations of support levels can't be good news for the bulls. The weight
    of the evidence indicates that a bear market has begun.
