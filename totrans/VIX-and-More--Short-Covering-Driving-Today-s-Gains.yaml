    rallies is to create a portfolio consisting of stocks and ETFs for which there
    is a large outstanding [short interest](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/short%20interest).

    put together one such portfolio yesterday, using the [Finviz.com screener](http://finviz.com/screener.ashx)
    to identify high volume securities where short positions are a large percentage
    of the float.

    an average of 11.8% halfway through today’s session, suggesting that short covering
    is fueling a large portion of today’s rally. Note that 7 of the 10 holdings are
    up more than 11% today, led by Deutsche Bank ([DB](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/DB))
    and MGM Mirage ([MGM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/MGM)).
