    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    in the direction of the main Trend Model signal. A bullish Trend Model signal
    that gets less bullish is a trading "sell" signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend
    Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading "buy" signal. The history of
    actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of the trading model are shown by
    the arrows in the chart below. The turnover rate of the trading model is high,
    and it has varied between 150% to 200% per month.

    into an investment process. Trend following systems that employ one or more moving
    averages work well longer term, but they have the disadvantages of being slow
    (by design), and they can produce false positives which whipsaw during trendless
    periods.

    bear markets, but at the cost of numerous whipsaws, which are circled.

    If you could cut off the left tail of the return distribution and avoid the really
    ugly losses, you could run a slightly more aggressive asset mix and receive a
    higher expected return with lower risk. For example, if the standard risk-return
    analysis dictates a 60% stock and 40% bond asset mix, you could change it to a
    70/30 mix with this model, and get downside risk similar to the 60/40 portfolio.
    To be sure, this system isn't perfect, and anyone using such a model will have
    to incur "normal" equity risk, and it would not have kept you out of the market
    in the 1987 Crash.

    factors that are not captured by the Recession Watch indicators are sufficiently
    negative for me to call for a recession to start in late 2019 or early 2020\.
    The combination of weak stock prices and a recessionary call therefore changes
    my Ultimate Market Timing Model to a sell signal.

    an acceptable level of equity risk for a long-term asset allocation model for
    patient money. Investment oriented accounts should move to a maximum defensive
    posture. Tactically, the market is very oversold and poised for a relief rally.
    Investors should take advantage of any strength to reduce equity risk. Traders
    may want to position themselves for the anticipated advance into year-end.
