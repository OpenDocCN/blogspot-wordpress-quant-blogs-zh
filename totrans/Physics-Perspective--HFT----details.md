# Physics Perspective: HFT -- details

An Op-Ed I wrote for Bloomberg on high-frequency trading

[finally appeared today](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-05/with-high-speed-trading-market-cannot-hold-commentary-by-mark-buchanan.html)

after a short delay due to a Bloomberg backlog. I meant for there to be a link in the article to further discussion here of some of the details of Andrew Haldane's argument, but that link is not yet in place at Bloomberg because of a mix up. It should be fixed later today. Meanwhile, for anyone visiting here from Bloomberg the further discussion I've given on Haldane's work can be found

Sorry for the confusion!
