- en: about a man who found $45k hidden in a house he bought from the family of an
    old man who recently died. He did the good thing, and gave the money to his family.
    Back in the 1970's, my family moved into a rather unique new house in a suburb
    of Cleveland Ohio. It was reputedly constructed by a mafia man, and had a fun
    rec room we called 'the ballroom' because it had floors for dancing with speakers
    and a bar with mirrors at one end. We bought it for $80k, which was slightly above
    market in my neighborhood, but nothing one would consider rich (not a prime residential
    neighborhood).

  zh: 关于一个男人在他从最近去世的老人家族购买的房子里发现了45k美元的故事。他做了正确的事情，把钱交给了他的家人。回到20世纪70年代，我的家人搬进了俄亥俄克利夫兰郊区一栋相当独特的新房子。据说这所房子是由一位黑手党成员建造的，里面有一个我们称之为“舞厅”的有趣游乐室，因为里面有可以跳舞的地板、扬声器和一个带镜子的酒吧。我们花了$80k买下它，这在我所在的社区中略高于市价，但并不算什么富裕（并不是一个高档住宅区）。
- en: In any case, a couple years after we bought it, my dad was trimming the house,
    and found a $10 bill coming out of the molding connected to the roof. He went
    into the attic, looked in the floorboard near this $5, and found $5k in cash that
    were all dated from the 1950s. We didn't give it back, because it literally had
    blood on it, implying that its exposure might be unappreciated by the former homeowners.
    I remember how fun it was freshening up the old bills with a laundry iron. My
    mom's second career after raising me and my siblings was as an IRS agent, and
    she made me report my summer lawn mowing income, so this was her one little transgression
    against The Man.

  zh: 无论如何，我们买这所房子几年后，我爸爸修理房子时，在连接屋顶的模制上发现了一张$10的钞票。他进了阁楼，在这张$5附近的地板上找到了一大叠五十年代的现金，总值$5k。我们没有退还它，因为上面真的有血迹，表明前房主对其接触可能并不感激。我记得用洗衣熨斗给旧钞票润色是多么有趣。我妈妈在抚养我和我的兄弟姐妹之后的第二份职业是国税局的一名雇员，她让我报告了我夏天给别人割草的收入，所以这是她对那个人的一点小违反。
