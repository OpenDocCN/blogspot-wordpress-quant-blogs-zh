- en: about a man who found $45k hidden in a house he bought from the family of an
    old man who recently died. He did the good thing, and gave the money to his family.
    Back in the 1970's, my family moved into a rather unique new house in a suburb
    of Cleveland Ohio. It was reputedly constructed by a mafia man, and had a fun
    rec room we called 'the ballroom' because it had floors for dancing with speakers
    and a bar with mirrors at one end. We bought it for $80k, which was slightly above
    market in my neighborhood, but nothing one would consider rich (not a prime residential
    neighborhood).

- en: In any case, a couple years after we bought it, my dad was trimming the house,
    and found a $10 bill coming out of the molding connected to the roof. He went
    into the attic, looked in the floorboard near this $5, and found $5k in cash that
    were all dated from the 1950s. We didn't give it back, because it literally had
    blood on it, implying that its exposure might be unappreciated by the former homeowners.
    I remember how fun it was freshening up the old bills with a laundry iron. My
    mom's second career after raising me and my siblings was as an IRS agent, and
    she made me report my summer lawn mowing income, so this was her one little transgression
    against The Man.
