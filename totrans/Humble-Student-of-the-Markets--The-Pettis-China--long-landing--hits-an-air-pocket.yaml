    choose a "long landing", in which growth rates drop sharply but in a controlled
    way such that unemployment remains reasonable even as GDP growth drops to 3% or
    less, or it will choose what analysts will at first hail as a soft landing - a
    few years of continued growth of 6%-7% - followed by a collapse in growth and
    soaring unemployment.

    and destabilizing contraction in growth. Rather than hail the soft landing as
    a signal that Beijing is succeeding in managing the economic adjustment, it should
    be seen as an indication that Beijing has not been able to implement the reforms
    that it knows it must implement. A "soft landing" should increase our fear of
    a subsequent "hard landing". It is not an alternative.

    consisted of liberalizing reforms that undermined the Communist elite and which
    were strongly opposed by them. Because power was highly centralized under Deng
    Xiaoping, however, including a loyal PLA, he and the reform faction were nonetheless
    able to force through the reforms.

    relationship to the interests of the Chinese elite. Because they involved the
    accumulation and distribution of resources to favored groups whose role was to
    achieve specific economic targets, they helped to reinforce the wealth and power
    of a new elite, many of whose members were, or were related to, the old elite.
    Not surprisingly this new elite strongly supported the growth model imposed by
    Beijing during these stages.

    to embark. In an important sense it involves liberalizing reforms similar politically
    to those that Deng imposed during the 1980s, making it vitally important to their
    success that the current administration is able to centralize power and create
    support to overcome the inevitable opposition, which it seems to be doing.

    the problem of excess credit creation, I nonetheless think it is moving in the
    right direction. For now I would give two chances out of three that Beijing will
    manage an orderly “long landing”, in which growth rates continue to drop sharply
    but without major social disruption or a collapse in the economy. In this issue
    of the newsletter I want to write out a little more explicitly what such an orderly
    adjustment might look like.

    Plenum objective of rebalancing from credit-driven infrastructure driven growth
    to the consumer driven growth. This involves the ending, or at least, the reduction
    of financial repression, which lowered the cost of capital for SOEs at the expense
    of the household sector as regulated banking interest rates were driven to below
    zero in real terms by the central government.

    bank credit overuse capital, and use it very inefficiently. They would be irrational
    if they didn’t, especially if their objective was not profit but rather to maximize
    employment, revenues, market share, or opportunities for rent capture (as economists
    politely call it).

    the benefits of growth are distributed in ways that are not only unfair but must
    create imbalances. Because low-risk investments return roughly 20% on average
    in a country with 20% nominal GDP growth, financial repression means that the
    benefits of growth are unfairly distributed between savers (who get just the deposit
    rate, say 3%), banks, who get the spread between the lending and the deposit rate
    (say 3.5%) and the borrower, who gets everything else (13.5% in this case, assuming
    he takes little risk – even more if he takes risk).

- en: This “unfair” distribution of returns is the main reason why the household share
    of income has collapsed from the 1990s until recently. I calculate that for most
    of this century as much as 5-8% of GDP was transferred from households to borrowers.
    The IMF calculated a transfer amount equal to 4% of GDP, but said it might be
    double that number, so we are in the same ballpark. This is a very large number,
    and explains most of why the growth in household income so sharply lagged the
    growth in GDP.

    total production of goods and services (at the expense of the elite, of course,
    who benefitted from subsidized borrowing costs) and so not only will they not
    be hurt by a sharp fall in GDP growth, but their consumption will increasingly
    drive growth and innovation in China.

    and more predictable legal system on businesses, reduce rent-capturing by oligopolistic
    elites, reform the financial system (both liberalizing interest rates and improving
    the allocation of capital), and even privatize assets, 3-4% GDP growth can be
    accompanied by growth in household income of 5-7%. Remember that by definition
    rebalancing means that household income must grow faster than GDP (as happened
    in Japan during the 1990-2010 period).

    cause social disturbance or even chaos because of angry, unemployed mobs is not
    true. If Chinese households can continue to see their income growth maintained
    at 5% or higher, they will be pretty indifferent to the seeming collapse in GDP
    growth*** (as indeed Japanese households were during the 1990-2010 period). Second,
    because consumption creates a more labor-intensive demand than investment, much
    lower GDP growth does not necessarily equate to much higher unemployment.

    pace in order to maintain social cohesion for Chinese society. As long as the
    average household sees a decent increase in its standard of living, Beijing can
    keep a lid on social tension and maintain the Mandate of Heaven.

    interviews with vendors across commercial categories and triangulating the interview
    data with what we can see from the statistics. In each case, cities that have
    seen a decline in property sales almost immediately see a decline in spending
    in the industries we survey, with the sharpest downturns generally in property-related
    categories such as furniture and building materials. Next-weakest are usually
    consumer electronics and white goods, then food, while there is often growth left
    in clothing and personal care. ***The near identity between property and the consumer
    economy indicates that a slump in property must lead to a spike in investment
    in order to buoy the preferred areas.***
