- en: Diversification will give some protection during slight or even moderate market
    perturbations. When a real disaster hits, supposedly diversified investments are
    subject to similar losses as concentrated positions because our portfolio constructs
    do not include sufficient non-correlating assets. In other words, in major sell-offs,
    everything moves together, albeit at varying rates. Losing less than market averages
    is not a comforting factor when your portfolio is down 30% to 50%.

    the major stock market declines (1987 and 2008), systematic, trend-following systems
    garnered returns that could have made a significant and positive impact on portfolio
    performance. In 2008, BarclayHedge’s Systematic Index, a weighted average of some
    448 CTA’s, rose 18.6% while the S&P500 declined precipitously (-38.5%). Genesis
    Futures’ NT4 system adheres to this paradigm.

    investor can have his cake and eat it too. You get positive returns when other
    markets are bad and returns roughly in line with other asset classes during other
    times.
