- en: I don't often discuss trade idea results from the subscriber letter here on
    the blog. In fact, I checked and it looks like the last time I did so was a little
    over two years ago. I used to do it more often, but I fell out of the habit. Also
    while I've always posted and tracked trade ideas in the subscriber letter, it
    isn't the main focus of the service. I don't consider Quantifiable Edges to be
    a stock picking service. I consider it one where traders can gain market and trading
    knowledge through the published research, systems, and tools. The objective is
    to provide tools and instruction to help traders improve their own trading and
    results.

  zh: 我不建议交易仓位大小，也永远不会建议交易想法代表任何完整的投资组合策略。它们就是它们——关于某些股票或ETF历史上提供统计优势的想法。
- en: All of the trade ideas are in either highly liquid ETFs or in highly liquid
    large cap stocks (almost exclusively S&P 100 components). I do this so that executing
    trades and getting fills at reasonable prices is not an issue. I think the most
    frustrating aspect of following trade ideas offered by another person (not that
    I'm encouraging that, but I know it happens) is not being able to get into or
    out of the trades that they suggest at a similar price. I’ve addressed this problem
    with limit prices and highly liquid securities.

  zh: 所有交易想法都集中在高度流动的ETF或者大型市值股票上（几乎完全是标普100成分股）。这样做是为了确保执行交易和以合理价格获得成交不是问题。我认为在跟随他人提供的交易想法时最令人沮丧的是（我不是鼓励这样做，但我知道这种情况会发生），无法以相似的价格进入或退出他们建议的交易。我通过限价和高度流动的证券解决了这个问题。

- en: '*All trade ideas ever tracked in the Quantifiable Edges Subscriber Letter may
    be found on this spreadsheet. I don’t suggest position sizes. The primary reason
    for this is I’m not acting as a financial advisor. I don’t feel it is appropriate
    to suggest allocation sizes without understanding someone’s financial situation
    and risk tolerance. Even for my own trading I run different portfolios with different
    levels of aggressiveness. For instance, my most aggressive may use options to
    sometimes get 300-400% leveraged. Other portfolios on the other hand normally
    take much more conservative stances and some rarely reach or exceed 100% exposure.'
  id: totrans-24

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: '*在Quantifiable Edges订阅通讯中跟踪的所有交易想法都可以在这个电子表格中找到。我不建议头寸大小。主要原因是，我没有担任财务顾问。我觉得在没有了解某人的财务状况和风险承受能力的情况下，建议分配大小是不适当的。即使是我自己的交易，我也运行不同激进程度的多个投资组合。例如，我最激进的可能使用期权有时达到300-400%的杠杆。另一方面，其他投资组合通常采取更加保守的立场，有些很少达到或超过100%的敞口。'
- en: Since I don’t suggest position sizes this is should not be considered a performance
    report, but rather a trade idea scorecard. Therefore, no matter how objective
    I try to be the reporting of the results is always going to be skewed depending
    on how you approach the trades. For instance, I always recommend scaling into
    the Catapult positions in 3 parts, whereas the “System” trades (whatever system
    I unveil other than Catapult) are normally one entry. The “Index” trades I normally
    recommend scaling into as well. For my own trading I trade much larger size with
    the index trades than any of the individuals. I also control my exposure by limiting
    the total amount invested per day. As I mentioned, this will vary depending on
    the account I’m trading. My most aggressive account I may put in up to 100%/day
    and get heavily leveraged using options. A more conservative account may max out
    at 15%-20% per day.

  zh: 由于我不建议设定持仓大小，所以这不应该被看作是一个业绩报告，而更是一个交易想法的记分卡。因此，无论我如何努力保持客观，结果的呈现总是取决于你对待交易的方式。例如，我总是建议分三次进入Catapult的仓位，而“系统”交易（除了Catapult之外的任何我公布的系统）通常只有一次入场。我通常也建议对“指数”交易进行分批进入。就我自己的交易而言，我交易的指数仓位的大小远大于个别的交易。我还通过限制每天总投资额来控制我的风险。正如我提到的，这会根据我交易的账户类型而有所不同。我最为积极的账户可能会每天投入高达100%，并使用期权进行高度杠杆操作。而更为保守的账户可能每天最多只能达到15%-20%。
- en: It’s unlikely anyone would have taken all of the trades with equal amounts,
    so personal results would vary greatly depending on the trader’s approach. Simply
    adding up the results of the individual triggers as I do is an admittedly poor
    representation of returns. A net positive or negative does not necessarily mean
    a person following the ideas would have made or lost money during the period measured.
    And the sum total is certainly not representative of what a portfolio would return.
