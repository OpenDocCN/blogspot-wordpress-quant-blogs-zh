# Magmasystems Blog: Aleri and STAC

Congrats to Aleri for being the first CEP vendor to volunteer their product to undergo scrutiny from

[STAC Research.](http://www.stacresearch.com/)

STAC first announced this program at last September's Gartner CEP Summit, but I am surprised that none of the other CEP vendors have joined this program. Aleri's participation means one of two things ---- they are very confident in the power of their CEP engine and/or they are willing to pony up the participation fee.

I am interested to see the test cases that STAC comes up with. Hopefully, these test cases will be created by an impartial party.
