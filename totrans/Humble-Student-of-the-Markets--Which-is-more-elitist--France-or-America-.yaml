    the world. Given the rates of taxation, and the difficulty of being fired, most
    people still do a fair amount of work and they do it fairly well. If that's not
    a work ethic, what is?

    This is one reason, not always voiced as such, why immigration in such an issue

    whether it be for clothing, music, food, or for that matter Hollywood movies and
    American blues and jazz. The French government tries to influence this activity,
    or put up some nominal protectionist measures, but for the most part this French
    specialty and strength remains unregulated. It helps account for the very high
    living standard there.

    of dimensions for status competition. Very often there is one right way to do
    things, to dress, and so on. But that's also part of what makes the place work.

    the undue inﬂuence of corporate America on the government, and hence the laws,
    taxes, and social policies of the country.  This has occurred to such a degree
    that there seems little real independence in Congress, with most Congressmen answering
    ﬁrst to the desire to be reelected and the consequent need to obtain funding from,
    shall we say, sponsors, and the need to avoid making powerful enemies.  “Well,
    Senator, we have $10 million here, which can either be used to point out how wise
    and desirable you are for your sensible vote on the upcoming energy bill or, alternately,
    can be used to point out how un- American and anti-job you are.  Your call.”'

    runs a close second to the energy industry.  In the last 10 years or so, their
    machine, led by the famously failed economic consultant Alan Greenspan – one of
    the few businessmen ever to be laughed out of business – seemed perhaps the most
    effective.  It lacks, though, the multi-decadal attitude-changing propaganda of
    the oil industry.

    enormous proﬁt of their industry.  Even with the biggest-ever ﬁnancial ﬁasco,
    entirely brought on by the collective incompetence they produced (“they” being
    the ﬁ nancial regulators and the ﬁnancial industry leaders working together in
    some strange, would-be symbiotic relationship), reform is still difﬁ cult.  Even
    with everyone hating them, the ﬁ nancial industry comes out smelling like a rose
    with less competition, proﬁ ts higher than ever, and not just too big to fail,
    but bigger still.
