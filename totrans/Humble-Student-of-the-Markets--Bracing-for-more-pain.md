# Humble Student of the Markets: Bracing for more pain

In theory, stock prices should be poised to rally. The SPX is testing a key support zone dating back to October 2014 and it is experiencing positive divergences on the 5 and 14 day RSI. If it did bottom here, the initial target would be the first Fibonacci retracement level at about 1935, with further resistance at about 1975 and 2010.

The bulls are set up for some short-term disappointment. I wrote on Sunday that I expected further stock market weakness ahead for this week because momentum was weak and readings were not oversold (see
