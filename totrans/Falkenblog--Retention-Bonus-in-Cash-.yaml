- en: AIG paid 22 people over $2MM each as retention bonuses, even though they worked
    in the Financial Products Division that basically sets the standard for bad investing.
    If you want a key employee to stay, your pay is in exchange for future services.
    If they have the option to leave right after the bonus, this is not a retention
    bonus, but rather, a bonus for performance, such as a percent of commissions or
    revenues generated.

  zh: AIG给22个人各支付超过$2MM的现金留任奖金，即使他们是在基本上设定了糟糕投资标准的金融产品部门工作。如果你想要一名关键员工留下，你支付的是以后服务的报酬。如果他们在领取奖金后立即离开的选项，这不是留任奖金，而是绩效奖金，比如佣金或创造的收入的比例。
- en: Thus, it makes zero sense to pay someone cash as a retention bonus. You should
    pay them in restricted stock, or call it something else. As part of a unit that
    basically bankrupted the company, I do not see any reason why one should pay a
    premium for these people, because when a unit like that fails so massively, the
    option to cherry pick trades that made money and lobby for a piece of those profits
    is worthless. The Financial Products group is so worthless, such tendentious pleading
    should fall on deaf ears. Further, paying them cash makes no sense for shareholders.
    It seems like an "

  zh: 因此，给某人现金作为留任奖金是毫无意义的。你应该用受限股票支付他们，或者称其为其他什么。作为基本上使公司破产的部门的一部分，我看不出有什么理由为这些人付出溢价，因为当这样的部门如此彻底地失败时，精选赚钱的交易并游说获得这些利润的机会是毫无价值的。金融产品组是如此无价，这样的刻意恳求应该不予理睬。此外，给他们现金对股东没有意义。这似乎是对股东的一种“”

- en: 'This just highlights the ability of corporate insiders to appropriate value
    from shareholders. I wouldn''t give them a special tax, as a government agent
    I would just liquidate the company, unless they can pay back my investment immediately.
    The franchise value should go to zero, and debt holders may bear some losses.
    If this happens, perhaps insiders will not try this as much in the future, because
    capital providers would care about such things. In this market there are a lot
    of smart people, knowledgeable about derivatives and financial products, looking
    for work. The notional amounts are scary, but it is straightforward, and the current
    management is clearly not operating in ''good faith'', and once you know that,
    you need to excise them asap. Breaking promises is warranted because basically
    this company is bankrupt, and employees are unsecured creditors. In the same way
    I think Ford and GM need to abrogate their old UAW contracts, AIG should abrogate
    million dollar cash retention bonuses. Both are not in the capital provider''s
    best interest, and as these people need capital, it should present such firms
    with a choice: adjust your contracts or get in line with everyone else to pick
    over the company''s assets.'

  zh: 这只是凸显了企业内部人员占用股东价值的能力。我不会给他们特别的税收，作为政府代理，我会立刻清算公司，除非他们能立刻偿还我的投资。特许经营价值应该归零，债权人可能会承担一些损失。如果发生这种情况，也许内部人员以后就不会这样频繁尝试，因为资本提供者会在乎这样的事情。在这个市场上，有很多聪明人，精通衍生品和金融产品，正在寻找工作。名义金额让人感到害怕，但一切都很直接，目前的管理很明显没有在“善意”下运作，一旦你知道了这一点，你需要尽快将他们清除掉。违约是正当的，因为基本上这家公司破产了，雇员属于无担保债权人。同样，我认为福特和通用汽车需要取消他们旧的美联汽车工会合同，AIG应该取消百万美元现金留任奖金。这两者都不符合资本提供者的最佳利益，因为这些人需要资本，这应该让这些公司面临一个选择：修改你们的合同，或者和其他人一样排队挑选公司的资产。
