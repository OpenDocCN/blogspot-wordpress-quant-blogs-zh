    with the strong momentum that the market has displayed. Ari Wald recently pointed
    out that the market is experiencing a "good overbought" condition (my words, not
    his) that has the potential to carry the market much higher.'

    The SPX is trading above its upper weekly Bollinger Band (BB). Past episodes,
    when viewed in isolation, have been relative benign. The market has either continued
    grind upwards, or move sideways. That said, I am monitoring the weekly RSI-14
    indicator when the market is above its upper BB. Past breaks below the 70 after
    an overbought reading have seen the market pull back. (Note that the weekly RSI
    reading remains above 70, and therefore no sell signal has been generated.)

    of breaking down. Such a development could be a signal of near term market weakness.
