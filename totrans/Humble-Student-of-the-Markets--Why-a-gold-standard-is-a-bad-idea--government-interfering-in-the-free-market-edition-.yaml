    that the government, or some other authority, is interfering with free market

    interference in the free market. The tale begins in the 1600s, when England was
    on a bi-metal gold and silver standard:'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A bi-metallic standard is a monetary system consisting of two metals—usually
    gold and silver— where the government or the mint fixes the price between the
    two metals. As a hypothetical example, the mint might determine that 1 ounce of
    gold = £1 and 1 ounce of silver = 1¢. Therefore, 1 ounce of gold = 100 ounces
    of silver. The key to making a bi-metallic standard successful is two-fold. First,
    the mint and the public must be willing to buy or exchange 100 silver coins for
    a gold coin, and vice versa. This is called maintaining mint price parity. But
    just as importantly, the mint must be willing to buy gold and silver bullion from
    the commodity markets for £1 per ounce of gold and 1¢ per ounce of silver, respectively.
    This is called maintaining market price parity to the mint price. If external
    forces change the market price of the underlying metal—for example, if a gold
    rush causes gold to flood the market, forcing the market price for gold down—the
    mint must decide whether to continue buying gold bullion at an inflated price
    or to change the fixed rate between the gold and silver coins through a re-coinage.

- en: When the market price of silver began to rise in the 1690s relative to the mint
    price, silver started flowing from England to the European Continent. So while
    the difference between the mint price and the market price fueled the incentive
    to clip silver coin and sell the clippings in the continental commodity markets,
    the poor mint quality made it even more difficult to detect a clipped coin, leading
    to a situation reminiscent of the [Kipper und Wipperzeit](http://www.atl-res.com/finance/LARKIN2.pdf) crisis
    of the 1620s described in our earlier [post](http://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2013/06/crisis-chronicles-300-years-of-financial-crises-1620-1920.html).
    At the same time, the Royal Mint was paying more than market price for gold bullion,
    so gold bullion began to flow from the Continent to England.

- en: By 1695, high-value gold coins were plentiful in England but there was a notable
    shortage of small-denomination silver coins, creating a monetary contraction.This
    led to a dual problem. First, the monetary contraction inhibited the ability to
    pay the armies engaged in the Nine Years’ War. Second, because silver was used
    for small-denomination subsidiary coins, the coin shortage impeded everyday transactions
    between individuals. The Bank of England did not have the authority to intervene
    in the markets, so a “Commission on the Coinage” was chartered from 1694 to 1695
    to deal with the crisis.

- en: In January 1696, the Act for Remedying the Ill State of the Coin of the Kingdom
    stipulated that by May 4, clipped coin would no longer be legal tender, and by
    June 24, clipped coin would no longer be accepted for tax payments. But the Royal
    Mint was woefully unprepared to replace the monetary base and had only minted
    about 15 percent of the silver coin needed for the exchange. Compare this to the
    preparation for issuing the euro, when European central banks stockpiled roughly
    350 coins per capita in anticipation of the euro launch. While the milled-edge
    design used in the re-coinage prevented further coin clipping, it didn’t address
    the ongoing attack on silver coinage by seventeenth-century arbitrageurs and the
    continuing silver outflows. These problems resulted in depositors flocking to
    the Bank of England on May 4 to demand specie. By May 6, the Bank of England was
    forced to forestall debt payments, and it was not able to resume payments until
    October, when it received a loan from the Dutch government...

    the only remaining liquidity in the market, with the Duke of Beaufort famously
    being forced to pay for a dinner by entering his name in a book at the height
    of the crisis. The crisis ultimately spurred a new era of economies driven by
    a broad set of financial instruments, not just specie, and laid the foundations
    for the later development of “fiat money,” which is backed by full faith and credit
    in the issuing government, as we’ll explore in a future post on the Continental
    Currency Crisis.

    price between gold and silver, the government imposed a fixed exchange rate and
    crisis ensued. What is instructive is that this occurred in the context of a hard
    currency economy based on precious metals.

    fiat currency system with a commodity based system as a brake on government spending,
    these kinds of unintended consequences are of the "we had to raze the village
