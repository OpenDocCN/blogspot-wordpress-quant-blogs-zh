    to telephones, railroads, or canals – has been accompanied by early massive hype
    and a stock market bubble as investors focus on the ultimate possibilities of
    the technology, pricing most of the very long-term potential immediately into
    current market prices. And many such revolutions are in the end often as transformative
    as those early investors could see and sometimes even more so – but only after
    a substantial period of disappointment during which the initial bubble bursts.
    Thus, as the most remarkable example of the tech bubble, Amazon led the speculative
    market, rising 21 times from the beginning of 1998 to its 1999 peak, only to decline
    by an almost inconceivable 92% from 2000 to 2002, before inheriting half the retail
    world!

    investor problem of being too early and overly reliant on valuation for his views.
    I reiterate my view that it’s still early in the bull cycle for AI stocks (see
