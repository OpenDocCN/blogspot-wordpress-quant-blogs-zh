    to limber up for [Taleb’s lecture](https://etrading.wordpress.com/2007/04/23/the-black-swan/)
    next week. [Popper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Popper) has a couple of
    famous trading adherents: [Soros](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soros) and [Taleb](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soros).
    [Popper’s key idea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Popper#Philosophy_of_Science)
    is that science proceeds by falsification, not verification. For example, the
    observation of a single black swan falsifies the hypothesis that “all swans are
    white”. Falsifiability is what distinguishes scientific conjecture from other
    disciplines that merely claim to be scientific. [Kuhn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Samuel_Kuhn),
    in the [Structure of Scientific Revolutions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Samuel_Kuhn#The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions_.281962.29),
    points out that many other factors beyond falsification, including social ones,
    determine which theories scientists advocate.'

    outlook. If you have a hypothesis about the market that conjecture becomes directly
    open to falsification when you put a trade on. If the trade loses money, your
    hypothesis is falsified.

    isn’t advocated by philosophically minded traders with a strong empirical bent,
    like Taleb and [Niederhoffer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Samuel_Kuhn#The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions_.281962.29).
    However, I would expect it to be sympathetic for market theorists who adress human
    factors more directly, as per behavioural economics. And I’d expect [Feyerabend’s
    epistemological anarchism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyerabend#Work_regarding_the_nature_of_scientific_method)
    to be appealing to philosophically minded traders who are agnostic about styles
    and methods. After all Feyerabend tells us there can be no rules for conducting
    scientific investigation, falsifiability or otherwise. The only possible rule
    is “anything goes!” Translated into trading that means we can entertain technical
    analysis, growth, value, momentum, contrarian or Niederhoffer’s ever changing
    cycles. Anything goes – the only thing that counts is what makes money.
