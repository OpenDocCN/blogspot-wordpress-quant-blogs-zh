# Typesafe Activator Coolness | Tales from a Trading Desk

## Typesafe Activator Coolness

Many months ago Typesafe open [sourced](https://www.typesafe.com/blog/typesafe-activator-is-now-open-source) [Activator](http://typesafe.com/activator).  Although it may seem like this posting is late to the party, which it is 🙂 , the posting was written some months back, I just kept forgetting to push the publish button.  Hence, although late, its worth mentioning that Activator is cool.  Templates cover the usual basic intro, coupled with an appropriate finance template, Akka, WebSocket and Angular.JS.  Excellent stuff if your into Akka 😉
