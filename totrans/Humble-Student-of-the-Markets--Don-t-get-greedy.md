# Humble Student of the Markets: Don't get greedy

In my last post, I wrote that (see

):

While I still believe that equities will continue to grind upward, stocks appear to be a little extended in the short-run. My inner trader tells me to pull in my horns, raise a little cash and wait for a better entry level. This is strictly a tactical trading call with a time horizon of a week or so.

The chart of the SPX shows that the market has been exhibiting the bullish pattern of higher highs and high lows since early June. In the short-run, however, the market is now testing secondary resistance (dotted line) and faces further resistance at about 1% higher from current levels.

My short-term overbought/oversold indicator of the risk-on/risk-off trade shows the risk-on trade in overbought territory.

While an overbought market can get more overbought and there is further potential upside of 1% in the broader averages, the risk/reward ratio at this point is not tilted favorably for the bulls. I would rather wait for a better entry point if I had fresh cash and an aggressive trader may even wish to either lighten up positions or even possible go short in anticipation of lower prices in the near future.

Remember - this is a trading call only. Know your risk tolerances and adjust your positions accordingly.
