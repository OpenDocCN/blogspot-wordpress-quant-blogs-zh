    that whipsaw. Nevertheless, I must therefore respect the discipline of a well-defined
    investment process and re-orient the model portfolio to inflation hedge and growth
    vehicles, such as resource and emerging markets stocks.

    have in the past been better than my own opinion. Therefore I have opted to rely
