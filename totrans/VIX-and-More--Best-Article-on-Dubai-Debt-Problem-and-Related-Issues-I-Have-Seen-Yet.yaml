- en: I think the best way to look at crises (both big and small) is to think of them
    as learning opportunities. In the last year or so, many investors whose investing
    universe was narrowly bound by stocks have now become conversant in [credit default
    swaps](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/credit%20default%20swaps),
    the [TED spread](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TED%20spread), [the
    dollar](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/dollar), the carry trade,
    bank capital ratios and a whole host of concepts and statistics that they didn’t
    know existed in 2007.

    also be a learning trigger. Not familiar with the [political structure of the
    United Arab Emirates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates#Government_and_politics)?
    the [history of sovereign default](http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/chapters/0262195534chapm1.pdf)?
    [the principles of Islamic banking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_banking)?
    Now is an excellent time to learn – and perhaps profit – from becoming better
    informed about these issues.

    who are on top of the situation and whose work I was not previously aware of.
    One such instance is Bill Mitchell’s [Billy Blog](http://bilbo.economicoutlook.net/blog/),
    where I encountered [Dubai Is Not a Case of Sovereign Debt Default](http://bilbo.economicoutlook.net/blog/?p=6358),
    one of the best articles I have yet read on the Dubai situation. As for the author,
    how can you not like someone who provides a handy ([Political Compass](http://www.politicalcompass.org/test))
    plot of his ideology, an email address and a cell phone number on his blog? Mitchell
    describes himself as a professional musician who also just happens to be a Research
    Professor in Economics and Director of the Centre of Full Employment and Equity
    at the University of Newcastle, NSW Australia.

    you made directional bets on prices or volatility today, I hope at the very least
    you expanded you knowledge base and sources of information in order to give you
    a better perspective on events as they unfold next week and going forward.
