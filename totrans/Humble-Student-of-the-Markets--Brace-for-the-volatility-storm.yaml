    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

- en: Until the market sold off last Thursday, the VIX and SPX had been rising together.
    The 10-day correlation of the VIX and SPX spiked to over 0.7, which is highly
    unusual as the two indices tend to be negatively correlated with each other (top
    panel).

- en: The rise in implied volatility, as measured by the VIX Index, was not matched
    by rising realized volatility. The second panel in the chart below shows the width
    of the SPX Bollinger Band as a proxy for implied volatility, which has been tame.

    upwards sloping. The spread between 9-day, 1-month, and 3-month implied volatility
    was uniformly high by historical standards.

    While stock volatility has surged, bond market volatility remains tame. What's
    going on?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Historically, high correlations between SPX and VIX have usually led to market
    sell-offs. Under a minority of circumstances, they have also signaled market melt-ups.
    How can we explain these unusual conditions in the option market?
