# Front-Run The Delta: Wal-Mart's Good News?

> 来源：[https://frontrunthedelta.blogspot.com/2007/11/wal-marts-good-news.html#0001-01-01](https://frontrunthedelta.blogspot.com/2007/11/wal-marts-good-news.html#0001-01-01)

It seems ironic that this morning's rally is being credited to Wal-Mart for their

["better-than-expected" profits](http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/071113/wall_street.html?.v=15)

and a hint that the holiday shopping season "might be stronger than anticipated." Ironic in the sense that the market is getting reassurance from a brand known for their low prices and lower/middle-income customer.

Wouldn't a profit increase from a low-cost store be more conducive to harder times for middle America and the possibility, rather, in all likelihood, the probability, of a recession?

I'm betting Wednesday's PPI and Thursday's CPI data will erase today's gains.
