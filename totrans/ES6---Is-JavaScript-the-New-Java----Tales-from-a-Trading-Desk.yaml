- en: I’ve been to a few JavaScript meet-ups recently – some public, some internal.
     What’s clear is that [ES6](http://es6-features.org/) will be a breath of fresh
    air for [JavaScript](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features) – anyone Java software
    engineers looking at ES6 code will feel more at home.  Likewise any [ActionScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript)
    Flex developers will also feel a bit of deja vu.  With Node.js, and the browser
    language war won by JavaScript, one can’t help but wonder how JavaScript server
    side will evolve over the next few years within organisation that have historically
    only accepted JVM based languages.

- en: On the topic of JavaScript libraries and frameworks, there is an overwhelming
    number to [choose](https://www.lullabot.com/blog/article/choosing-right-javascript-framework-job)
    from, which in many ways requires a team to decide based on prior experience or
    spend time trying out options before venturing down a JavaScript road.  SDTimes
    offers some [views](http://sdtimes.com/the-future-of-javascript-is-almost-now/)
    on this subject – “The future of JavaScript is (almost) now”.  As I blogged about
    previous, [React](http://devdactic.com/pick-javascript-framework/) Native looks
    very interesting.  Paiza Engineering Blog offers a [view](http://engineering.paiza.io/entry/2015/03/12/145216)
    on Data binding code in 9 JavaScript frameworks.
