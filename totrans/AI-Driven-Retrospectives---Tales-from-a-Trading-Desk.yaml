- en: With the drive of AI and chatbot recently, its of no surprise to find [ScrumBot](https://www.scrumbot.co/). 
    What I think would however be more interesting is to hook the bot into a wider
    array of data outside of the Slack/Hipchat/Microsoft Teams world, maybe levering
    product metrics, as well as SDLC metrics.  [Standuply](https://standuply.com/)
    appears to hint at this via the third party metrics integration.  I suspect if
    the bot could leverage a appropriate metrics, its would be powerful not only from
    a retrospective, but also from a pair engineering experience as well
