- en: As a discretionary trader, I sometimes like to act on my gut before I get the
    proper confirmation signal to enter or exit a position. The bottom line is that
    I don’t mind being early and I don’t mind being wrong, as long as the economics
    of my gut is positive on balance.

    I was completely unfamiliar with. In fact, in [New Options Blog: masteroptions.com](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/07/excellent-new-options-blog.html),
    I had the nerve to call Dean Mouscher’s blog “a must read” after only two posts.
    Well, bloggers come and go, but if masteroptions.com were a stock, I think my
    IPO price would have at least doubled or tripled by now, based on the number of
    readers who thanked me for the recommendation.'

    and includes a new 16-minute video that details some of the essentials of the
    VIX, with an emphasis on [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures).
    Between Dean’s video and [My Ten Things Everyone Should Know About the VIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/04/ten-things-everyone-should-know-about.html),
    someone who is new to the VIX can get up to speed very quickly.

    SEC/CFTC regulatory split is responsible for quotes for VIX options erroneously
    using the cash VIX instead of VIX futures as the underlying for calculating VIX
    implied volatility (see [Calculating the Implied Volatility of the VIX](file:///C:%5CUsers%5Cwjl%5CDocuments%5C__Personal%5CFinance%5CVIX%5CVIX%20and%20More%5Cnd%20the%20potential%20fo)
