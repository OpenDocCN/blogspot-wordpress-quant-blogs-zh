    for some excellent spadework involving [yesterday’s proxy filing](http://sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/87565/000095015208009644/l32892bdef14a.htm)
    for plastics company A. Schulman ([SHLM](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=SHLM)).
    In [“Gone Fishing – Seriously…”](http://www.footnoted.org/perk-city/gone-fishing-seriously/)
    Leder flagged the section I have highlighted below in bold italics, but I thought
    it might be even more interesting to put the outlandish excerpt in the context
    of the broader scope of original document. The quotation is lifted from page 26
    from a section with the title “Perquisites and Personal Benefits*.”*'

  zh: '![](img/793aac74e88eb30f1d334387c7633be7.png)感谢Michelle Leder在[footnoted.org](http://www.footnoted.org/)上的出色工作，她分析了[昨日提交的代理申报书](http://sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/87565/000095015208009644/l32892bdef14a.htm)，涉及塑料公司A.
    Schulman ([SHLM](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=SHLM))。在[“Gone Fishing – Seriously…”](http://www.footnoted.org/perk-city/gone-fishing-seriously/)一文中，Leder标出了我下面用粗体斜体标出的部分，但我认为将其与原文的更广泛内容结合起来可能会更有趣。这段引用来自第26页，标题为“Perquisites
    and Personal Benefits*。”*'
- en: “In April of 2008, the Compensation Committee eliminated most perquisites and
    personal benefits that previously had been extended to our North American Named
    Executive Officers, such as providing automobiles and related costs, and increased
    their base salaries as compensation for foregone benefits ($32,000 for Mr. Gingo
    and $8,000 for Mr. DeSantis). No changes were made to the perquisites provided
    to our European Named Executive Officers, as such perquisites are more in line
    with European compensation practices. We continue to maintain a founders’ membership
    at Firestone Country Club, which membership entitles us to designate five persons
    as members, one of whom is Mr. Gingo. The Compensation Committee believes that
    this membership is a cost-effective method of providing business related entertainment
    to our customers and business partners. The Compensation Committee also determined
    to continue reimbursing a Named Executive Officer for temporary housing expenses
    because the continued uncertainty relating to activist shareholders’ demands makes
    it difficult to require the Named Executive Officer to permanently relocate to
    Northeastern Ohio.

    Country Club的创始人会员资格，该会员资格使我们能够指定五人为会员，其中一人为Gingo先生。薪酬委员会认为，这种会员资格是一种成本效益高的方法，为我们客户提供业务相关的娱乐。薪酬委员会还决定继续报销一名高管的临时住房费用，因为与积极股东要求的持续不确定性相关，难以要求高管永久搬迁到俄亥俄州东北部。

    a lease on a private airplane was no longer a cost-effective method for providing
    business-related transportation to our Named Executive Officers and Directors.
    The airplane was used only for business-related travel, and personal use was not
    permitted. With the termination of the lease on the airplane, it also became increasingly
    difficult and cost prohibitive to access our Canadian fish camp. Consequently,
    the fish camp, which was only used for business entertainment purposes, was offered
    for sale during 2008\. The only offer to purchase the fish camp came from Terry
    L. Haines, our former Chief Executive Officer and President. Ultimately we negotiated
    with Mr. Haines to sell the fish camp for a purchase price of $55,000 and the
    transaction closed during fiscal year 2009.***'

  zh: 在2008财年期间，薪酬委员会认为维持一架私人飞机的租赁不再是一种提供给我们的高管和董事有关商务交通成本效益的方法。这架飞机只用于商务旅行，不允许个人使用。随着飞机租赁的终止，也越来越难以且成本过高地访问我们的加拿大鱼营地。因此，这个仅用于商务娱乐目的的鱼营地，在2008年被提名为出售。唯一的购买鱼营地的报价来自我们的前首席执行官兼总裁Terry
    L. Haines。最终，我们与Haines先生协商，以55,000美元的价格出售了鱼营地，并在2009财年期间完成了这笔交易。
