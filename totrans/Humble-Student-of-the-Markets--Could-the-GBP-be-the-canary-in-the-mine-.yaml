    growth in what I considered to be wealth creating assets over the last ten years
    which could explain GDP growth; manufacturing, commodity extraction, export of
    services, and tourism (no net growth).'

    the source of all of the GDP growth of the last ten years. This debt, in conjunction
    with the multiplier effect, along with upwards levers such as immigration, created
    an illusion of growth in wealth. It led to the 'post industrial', 'service economy'.
    My argument was that this was completely unsustainable, and that a collapse in
    asset prices would signal a self-reinforcing downward spiral in the economy, driven
    by a collapse in consumer sentiment (a massive belt tightening) leading to the
    collapse of the service economy, higher unemployment, more belt tightening and
    so forth into a downward spiral.

    and monetary policies, it is possible that the USD does not fall against other
    currencies. Instead, inflationary expectations show up in commodity prices, inflation-indexed
    bonds and the long end of the yield curve.

    from the same problems, then one way that these pressures manifest themselves
    would be a fall in the GBP, which is not a significant reserve currency the same
    way the USD is.
