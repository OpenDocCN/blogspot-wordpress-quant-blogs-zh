    Halifax announcing yesterday that there was a 1.5 per cent fall in house prices
    between January and February, and with the slow economic recovery now on course
    to depress sentiment for the rest of the year.

    not by the central government directly, but by local governments, including cities,
    counties, and provinces. For the most part, however, they have limited funds and
    face official restrictions on their ability to borrow directly. To circumvent
    these limits, they set up special investment vehicles to borrow the money instead.
    Because these debts are supposedly guaranteed by the local governments (meaning
    they would step up to pay if the immediate borrower couldn’t), banks and other
    lenders tend to treat the loans as essentially risk-free. Northwestern University
    Professor Victor Shih calculates that local governments have already accumulated
    RMB 11 trillion (US$ 1.7 trillion) in outstanding debt, with RMB $13 trillion
    (US$ 1.9 trillion) in available credit lines, belying China’s low reported levels
    of public debt.

    all guarantees local governments have provided for loans taken by their financing
    vehicles as concerns about credit risks on such debt surges.” (According to the
    report, the Ministry of Finance is also drafting rules to ban local governments
    from issuing any more such guarantees in the future). Without the guarantees in
    place, ***Shih believes, China could face a “gigantic wave” of bad debts and halted
    projects***.

    landing, but fiscal and monetary authorities have had a nasty habit of overshooting
    and turning intended soft landings into hard landings. What happens to risk aversion
    should the US consumer slows (even more) at the same time that China slows? What
    does that do to the risk of a Chinese hard landing?
