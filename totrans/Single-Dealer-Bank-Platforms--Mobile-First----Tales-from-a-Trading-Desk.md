## Single Dealer/Bank Platforms: Mobile First?

Not sure that Wall Street & Technology’s article on [Mobile First](http://www.wallstreetandtech.com/it-infrastructure/wall-street-moving-toward-a-mobile-first/240149559) is telling us anything new that we didn’t know about the uptake of mobile devices in finance.  What will be interesting to watch is how quickly any of the existing Single Dealer/Bank Platform built using “legacy” Adobe Flex/Microsoft Silverlight technology migrate to mobile native/HTML5 solutions to get on the mobile bandwagon
