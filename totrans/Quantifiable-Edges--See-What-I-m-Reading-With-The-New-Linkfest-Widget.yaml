- en: I’ve added a new feature on the right hand column of the blog. One thing I’ve
    done a poor job of over time is posting links. It seems I only manage to get linkfest
    posts up once every couple of months. I do read a fair amount that I believe is
    worth sharing, but putting together posts full of links is arduous and I rarely
    get around to it. Fortunately I’ve now found a way to share some of the things
    I find most interesting on a daily basis.

    contains links to the work of others. You can see the last five posts from my
    reader that I decided were worth sharing.

    update it with fresh links as I read them.
