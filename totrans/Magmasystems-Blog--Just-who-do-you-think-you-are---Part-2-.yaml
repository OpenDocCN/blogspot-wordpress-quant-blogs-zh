- en: While doing my PHD studies at NYU, I was teaching computer science at Baruch
    College (part of the City University of New York system). I bumped into one of
    my old college buddies in the halls.... he was going for his MBA at Baruch. He
    told me that he and two friends were going to quit ValueLine and form their own
    company. He wanted to know if I might be interested in writing one of the first
    word processors for Unix.... I would write it, they would market it, and we would
    share the profits. Sounds good.

    Zenith CRT and 300 baud modem, I managed to crank out a respectable word processor....
    Initially named WPScribe. We showed the product at the very first Unix Expo in
    New York in October of 1984.

- en: The newly formed company did not last long. The profits that we made were consumed
    by the founders on the excesses of the 1980's. This left me without a marketing
    arm for my word processor (which, thankfully, I had the foresight to copyright
    in my name).
