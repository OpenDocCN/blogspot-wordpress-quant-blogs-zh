- en: One thing that struck me as clever with the HHT was the use of projecting a
    spline across the minima and maxima for a given harmonic.   In effect this defines
    the envelope for the series for a given harmonic (level of decomposition).   A
    posteri, the mean or mode should be more or less equivalent to the average of
    the envelope splines.   Interesting!

- en: This is a very appropriate way to model the mean within the context of mean-reversion
    (ie oscillations around the mode within an envelope).   Instead of trying to model
    the mean directly as a stochastic process, why not model the envelope — this is
    more appropriate as we can fit the envelope into our view of mean reversion.

- en: '**Version 1** I used a regressor to estimate the mean and connected minima
    and maxima with a spline for the envelope.  The approach has issues (such as what
    sort of bias does the mean regressor have with respect to the data).   There are
    some issues below:'

- en: '**Version 2** I took a dfference approach, estimating the inflection points
    with a regressing “oscillator”  (in green) and determining the mid-points between
    minima and maxima to produce a spline representing the mode (blue).   So far looks
    good.   Edge cases, consolidation, and jumps need to be considered:'
