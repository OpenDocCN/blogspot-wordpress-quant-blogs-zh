- en: The last hour rally has been common lately. The last hour is often viewed as
    the “smart money” hour, when institutions place many of their trades. Some indicators
    track either just last-hour movement or 1st hour and last hour. While the market
    has consolidated the SPY has moved up in the last hour for 4 days in a row now.
    I looked at other situations like this.

- en: Strong moves in the last hour are often interpretted as bullish. My rather simple
    test here shows no evidence of that going forward over the next week. I intend
    to explore the last hour concept in greater detail in the future.
