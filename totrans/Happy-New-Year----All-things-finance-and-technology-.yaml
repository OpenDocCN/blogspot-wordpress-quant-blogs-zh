    year and I’ve resolved that in 2013 I’m going to turn over a new leaf. I’m planning
    to write a series of posts on what I call ‘open finance’. My first post will introduce
    the powerful and elegant open-source C++ library, QuantLib (www.quantlib.org).
    In subsequent posts, I will demonstrate how QuantLib can be used to implement
    a variety of fundamental financial calculations. I’ll also throw in some C++ 11
    syntax to spice things up a bit. Stay tuned!
