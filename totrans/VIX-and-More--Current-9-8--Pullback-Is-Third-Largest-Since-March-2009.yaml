- en: A little more than two hours into today’s trading session, the S&P 500 index
    appears to have stabilized. Using this morning’s low print of 1282.94, the maximum
    peak-to-trough loss in the SPX is now 139.44 points – a 9.8% decline from the
    April 2^(nd) high of 1422.38.

    since stocks bottomed in early March 2009\. Note that the current pullback is
    the third largest in terms of magnitude as well as peak-to-trough duration, which
    stands at 41 days as of today.

    Look at the Pullbacks of the 2009-2012 Bull Market](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2012/05/look-at-pullbacks-of-2009-2012-bull.html)
    should help to put the current pullback into better perspective.

    replicate the 21.6% decline from 2011 or the 17.1% pullback from 2010, a comparable
    decline in percentage terms would put the SPX at 1115 and 1178, respectively.
