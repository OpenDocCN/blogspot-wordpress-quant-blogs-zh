    time is important. The distribution tends to be stable over longer periods and
    unstable over shorter periods.

    One may want to take a blend of distributions measured over different time periods,
    combined as basis functions with weights summing to 1.

- en: The interesting bit is predicting the distribution forward with some statistical
    accuracy. The order book and momentum indicators should tell us something about
    how the distribution is going to transform over the next period or based on when
    a certain price level is achieved.

    data. There are many different functions we could use, so we use a GP approach
    to play with the permutations.
