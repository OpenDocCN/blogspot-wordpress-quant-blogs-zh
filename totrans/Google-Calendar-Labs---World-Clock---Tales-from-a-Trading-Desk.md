## Google Calendar Labs – World Clock

Yet again ran into issues using the World Clock experimental feature in Google Calendar.  Basically the world clock feature appears to be unaware of daylight saving changes in regions. The latest being the start of Daylight Saving time in the USA.  Net out, scheduling a conference call for 1:30pm NYC caused me to miss the call 😦
