    gas -- which has been heated up to the point where the atoms come apart. At high
    enough temperature, the energy binding an electron to the nucleus (a single proton
    in this case) to form an atom is overwhelmed by the kinetic energy in collisions.
    The result is a hot gas of charged electrons and nuclei (protons), in which the
    particles, being charged, now interact over extended distances, unlike in normal
    gases where particles only interact when they undergo direct collisions.

    gases, whether the plasma is in the Sun or the Earth's upper atmosphere, in a
    nuclear reactor, the interstellar medium, or in a particle beam racing around
    an accelerator. The basic properties of a plasma in equilibrium -- say, held at
    a fixed temperature in a glass tube -- were worked out (at least approximately)
    long ago, although the physics is still so rich that many subtle mysteries remain.

    of equilibrium, things get infinitely more complicated. Natural plasmas not held
    in fixed and unchanging conditions do all kinds of surprising things -- mostly
    involving natural instabilities driven by positive feed backs.

    energy from nuclear fusion. The recipe for success seems simple: heat up some
    hydrogen gas to enormous temperatures and you create conditions in which colliding
    hydrogen nuclei will fuse together to form heavier nuclei. As an aside, you can''t
    use ordinary hydrogen, but have it''s isotopes, deuterium or tritium, the nuclei
    of which contain a proton and either one or two neutrons. These things can fuse
    together into unstable nuclei, which decay, ultimately creating nuclei of the
    stable element helium, with two neutrons and two protons. Lots of energy is given
    off in the process, so the reaction can be self-sustaining.'

- en: Lots of fusion requires nothing but high temperature (so the collisions are
    very energetic) and high density (so there are lots of collisions). So you put
    a mixture of deuterium and tritium into a container, heat it up and compress it,
    and there you go -- cheap, virtually inexhaustible energy. The only problem --
    and it's a very big problem -- is making the damned plasma behave itself as you
    try to do this.

    tritium in it, and blast it from all sides with extremely high intensity x-rays.
    This violent bath vaporizes the pellet surface, producing plasma that explodes
    outward, compressing the rest of the pellet inward and creating extreme densities
    and temperatures. Through further mechanisms -- colliding shock waves and such
    -- you hope to get a fair number of nuclei colliding with sufficient energy to
    undergo fusion, giving off still more energy.

    below illustrates the typical problem -- as the dense hot plasma rushes inwards,
    the spherical symmetry inevitably gets spoiled by growing ripples. These are caused
    mostly by the so-called Rayleigh-Taylor instability that happens whenever a lighter
    fluid pushes on a heavier fluid. As the waves get bigger, this first instability
    causes secondary instabilities of other kinds. In the figure below, the initially
    nice symmetry gets hopelessly ruined and different parts of the compressing system
    get mixed together, which undermines the process that would have given high temperature
    and density. Interestingly, what happens in inertial confinement fusion during
    implosion (left image) is very close to what happens during a supernovae explosion
    (right image).

    instability soon creates a cascade of other instabilities, and the situation becomes

    nuclei compressed and heated in a spherically symmetric situation. The system
    in fact is remarkably simple. But natural instabilities -- mechanisms that make
    small differences and imbalances grow into much larger ones -- make it's behaviour
    anything but simple. Fifty years of intense research and engineering on inertial
    confinement fusion still hasn't managed to tame these problems. The plasma always
    finds another way to do something surprising that no one predicted.

    Systems that are conceptually simple -- a beam of one single kind of particle
    flying around a circular ring in an accelerator -- can go unstable in hundreds
    of ways. There used to be a book (now out of print, I think) called the Handbook
    of Plasma Instabilities, which tried to list and describe all the stereotypical
    ways that a plasma in different simple situations will do something surprising
    and unexpected because of positive feed backs. It was about 800 pages long. Every
    entry testified to some situation in the past in which physicists or engineers
    had tried to do something with a plasma, only to find that it refused to go along
    -- its stable behaviour giving way, often explosively, to some wobbling or mixing
    or unexpected heating and so on.

    some charged particles held in a bottle -- has an extraordinarily rich set of
    dynamics because of natural non-linearities and interactions and the positive
    feed backs to which they lead. In the case of plasma, we know the laws of behaviour
    for the individual particles with perfect accuracy (Newtonian mechanics with corrections
    from quantum mechanics when necessary). Even so, these systems still surprise
    as as much as they do what we expect.

    with systems made of people driven by thoughts and emotions and interactions with
    other people. We surely don't know with perfection the laws of behavior of these
    people -- we have a few crude rules offering guidance to how they sometimes behave
    or might behave. Humans being among the most complex things in the universe, we
    should surely expect these systems to present a much richer set of possibilities
    than a simple plasma. Indeed, we know that markets and other economic systems,
    historically, have routinely acted in surprising ways and caused crises of many
    different kinds. Even so, theories in economics and finance have until very recently
    been centered almost entirely on the study of equilibrium systems, with positive
    feed backs rarely being considered.

    by physicists and others aimed at modeling and understanding natural instabilities
    in economic systems. The list of instabilities likely to be found will probably
    be a lot longer than the list in plasma physics. In my talk in Durham, I'm going
    to take a stab at making a similar (crude and very incomplete) list of some economic
    and financial instabilities. As in plasma physics, we should find instabilities
    acting on many timescales -- from milliseconds up to years. We should find some
    that act through fairly mechanical processes (laws which compel certain behaviours),
    and others working on the basis of natural human psychological and decision making
    tendencies (learning, speculation and so forth). We'll find some that take off
    through the actions of only a few parties (hedge funds, for example, during the
    "Quant Meltdown" of August 2007) and others driven by large-scale network effects.
