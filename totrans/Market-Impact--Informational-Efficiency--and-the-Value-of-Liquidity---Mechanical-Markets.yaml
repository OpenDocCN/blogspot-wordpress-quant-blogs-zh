    order flow do exist, but does that mean an outright ban on HFT would reduce trading
    costs? It’s hard to know the answer to that question, but it may be helpful to
    consider how instruments receive added value from financial markets.

    of obvious when you only consider first order effects; if a short term trader
    buys low and sells high, then the money they made has to come from their counterparties
    somehow. By this logic, if one type of trader consistently makes money, then they
    are doing so directly at the expense of the rest of the market. This view makes
    less sense when markets are sufficiently mature.

    and the expectation of continued liquidity. That liquidity is worth something.
    For long-term traders, a liquid marketplace makes it easy to find a partner to
    trade with. Imagine, for example, how much you would save when selling your home
    if you didn’t need a broker to find buyers. Liquidity also raises the value of
    assets themselves; in essence, something is worth more to you if you know that
    you can readily sell it later. How much more though? If a prospective buyer knew
    a home could be later sold without paying a 3% broker fee, then maybe they’d consider
    bidding 1% higher for it. In financial markets, the classic example of this phenomenon
    is the premium that on-the-run treasuries command in comparison to those that
    are off-the-run: A 30-year bond with only 10 years left until maturity generally
    trades at a lower price than a freshly issued 10-year bond, even though the two
    bonds should make payments that are effectively identical. The reason suspected
    for this discount is that the fresh 10-year is more actively traded and easier
    to sell if desired.'

    A put option offers its owner the ability to sell an asset in the future at a
    pre-determined price. Liquidity offers the owner of an asset the ability to sell
    in the future at the prevailing market price, whatever that may be. That difference
    is important – but even though the “option” associated with liquidity has an “exercise
    price” that floats with the market price, it is still worth something. Consider
    that investors pay their brokers for guaranteed executions at (or worse than)
    the market price. Or consider the existence of [trade-at-settlement](http://www.cmegroup.com/confluence/display/EPICSANDBOX/Trade+at+Settlement+-+TAS)
    products, where one party will pay another in order to guarantee an execution
    at the day’s settlement price (a measure of market price). A liquid security thus
    has an embedded put option that should increase its value. [[1](#bottom1impact)]
    Options, of course, increase in value when volatility rises. The price of liquidity
    appears to do the same, for instance on p.42 of [this paper](http://www.federalreserve.gov/Pubs/feds/2006/200628/200628pap.pdf),
    you can see that the on-the-run premium tends to be higher during times of high
    volatility. [[2](#bottom2impact)] [[3](#bottom3impact)] [[4](#bottom4impact)]

    and market impact. The spread is a measure of how much market-makers need to be
    compensated for the risk of trading with a counterparty large enough to move the
    price. Market impact is the change in price that occurs after a trade. Since large
    traders often split their transactions into many small child orders, market impact
    means that the latter part of these orders are executed at a less favorable price.
    Very roughly speaking, small traders are expected to have the bid-ask spread as
    their primary transaction cost and large traders are expected to have market impact
    as theirs. One common view is that these large traders are “informed” and their
    favorable information is why market-makers lose money when trading with them.

    funds. [[6](#bottom6impact)] [[7](#bottom7impact)] When stocks are expected to
    be incorporated into an index like the S&P 500, their prices rise in anticipation.
    And stock prices tend to fall when they are expected to be deleted from a popular

    made, funds that strictly follow an index will trade shares only after prices
    change, costing them money. [[8](#bottom8impact)] Some portion of these anticipatory
    price moves revert after the actual index changes are finalized (and large funds
    have completed their rebalancing) – which means that at least part of this expense
    is not in exchange for something of value, such as the added liquidity that index

    trades) move the market price at all? The standard adverse selection model would
    say that less aggressively priced orders in the order book are from market makers
    requiring compensation for the risk of being run over by large, informed traders.
    If that model were complete, an informational change would be the only reason
    a price should ever move. This view is a vestige of the Efficient Market Hypothesis
    (EMH). In reality, prices move in response to changes in supply and demand, even
    if those changes aren’t related to any new information. Consider a really simple
    model, where traders each have their own point estimate for the “intrinsic value”
    of a stock. Unless everybody has the same estimate, when somebody buys more stock
    than traders with the lowest estimate are willing to sell, the market price will
    rise. This is another way to think of an order book. [[10](#bottom10impact)] The
    EMH idea that traders without any information should not be able to significantly
    move prices is like saying that there are trillions of dollars of undeployed capital
    backed by first-rate analysis just waiting for stocks to move a few basis points
    before trading them. That description doesn’t sound like reality, but who knows,

- en: Because market impact is such an important force in our markets, detecting institutional
    order flow could be very lucrative. Market makers moving their quotes out of the
    way of suspected order flow is order anticipation. Trading in the direction of
    suspected order flow is also order anticipation, though some label it “front-running”.
    In public discourse lately, there’s been some tendency to claim that order anticipation
    is fundamentally the domain of HFT. This is clearly wrong. The connection between
    stock index changes and anticipatory price moves has a time scale of days, and
    has been a measurable effect for decades. Similarly, there was [suspicion](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-04-23/predatory-traders-front-ran-bill-ackman-s-botox-buy)
    recently that Pershing Square’s toehold purchase of Allergan shares suffered from
    order anticipation. Again, these price moves occurred over the scale of days,
    and as can be seen in an [analysis](http://neumann.hec.ca/cref/sem/documents/090918.pdf)
    by Betton, Eckbo, and Throburn, there is nothing new about toehold purchases exhibiting
    large price impact. [[11](#bottom11impact)] It’s hard to know how much of this
    impact is due to anticipatory trading or just supply and demand. Separating these
    two effects is particularly difficult because herding among traders is common
    and arguably a form of order anticipation itself. Traders’ tendency to make similar
    decisions simultaneously (herding) has an important influence on market impact,
    as discussed (among other things) in a [wonderful empirical study](http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.2152)
    by  Zarinelli, Treccani, Farmer, and Lillo. It’s also hard to dismiss order anticipation
    as unhealthy for markets. If liquidity providers were not able to price the risk
    of their counterparty being part of a takeover attempt, trading could become extremely

    encryption offers some additional insight. Loosely speaking, encryption is cheap
    and decryption is very challenging. If there’s sufficient background noise in
    which to camouflage an “encryptor’s” signal, then probably there isn’t much a
    “decryptor” can do to find that signal. Obviously, we can conceive of legal or
    market structures that would tilt the balance of power completely towards the
    “decryption” camp – like if the law required traders to announce their intentions
    before taking action. But, for common market structures, I suspect that it isn’t
    too hard to be almost “maximally” encrypted, that is, to have one’s orders disguised
    to the point where investing more in encryption isn’t going to measurably affect
    their detectability. I’m not claiming that everybody is this careful; there are
    plenty of examples of [sloppy trading](https://mechanicalmarkets.wordpress.com/2015/04/30/market-data-patterns-order-anticipation-and-an-example-trading-strategy/).
    But my intuition is that currently the majority of market impact comes from price
    inelasticity, not order anticipation. That said, I think it’s worthwhile to consider
    whether there are palatable market structures that allow orders to be better concealed.

    is high. Those increased profits could be partly due to the higher value of liquidity
    and a commensurate rise in demand for it. The entire financial sector is in some
    sense engaged in the business of selling option-value. One view of banks is that
    they make money via shorting liquidity: by holding assets (particularly fixed
    income) to maturity and riding out fluctuations in market value, they are rewarded
    with a small profit. And one argument against strict mark-to-market accounting
    is that it doesn’t properly encapsulate this aspect of banking. Another perspective
    is that when banks have shorted “too much” liquidity and the price of that liquidity
    has risen (i.e. volatility has gone up and the “option-value” component of liquidity
    is expensive), they tend to rely on governments and central banks to sell them
    additional liquidity cheaply in order to survive. If you consider this government

    [this analysis](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2291720) by
    Waelbroeck and Gomes. They used a dataset of institutional transactions with (most)
    “cash flow” trades separately marked. “Cash flow” trades are due to client inflows
    and outflows which are (probably) not reflective of fund managers’ decisions.
    When they exclude these “cash flow” trades, they find that, on average, returns
    are quite close to transaction costs for different portfolio managers (figure
    4, p23). They also find costs and returns are roughly in balance for transactions
    of different sizes (figures 12a and 12b, p41).'

    that the chat room traders sometimes did one, and sometimes the other, means that

    when they suspected that their counterparty bank would hedge in a low-impact fashion.
    When that was the case, the alleged manipulators could do their high-impact trading
    while their counterparty, on the opposite side, would do low-impact trading. When
    they suspected a rival bank would trade in a high-impact fashion, they might do
    the opposite. I’m not saying they were successful at this, but our markets may
    well allow a high-impact entrance and a low-impact exit, in contradiction with
    a sort of efficiency. Jim Gatheral calls this type of market efficiency, which
    renders manipulation impossible, a “[no-dynamic-arbitrage principle](https://math.nyu.edu/financial_mathematics/content/02_financial/2008-6.pdf).”
