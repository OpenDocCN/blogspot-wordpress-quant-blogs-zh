    posting generated a lot of interesting comments.  Overall, I think that UX in
    some organization is struggling with change – change due to baggage associated
    with how the information architects and designers have historically worked, and
    the tooling they have come to rely on.

    around agile – [Fitting Big-Picture UX Into Agile Development](http://uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com/2012/11/06/design-spikes-fit-big-picture-ux-agile-development/)
    offers some interesting views.  Likewise UX Matters offers [Is UX Strategy Fundamentally
    Incompatible with Agile or Lean UX?](http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2012/07/is-ux-strategy-fundamentally-incompatible-with-agile-or-lean-ux.php)
    and [When Agile and User Experience Click](http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2013/01/when-agile-and-user-experience-click.php). 
    Net out is that UX really has to be made to work with Agile, since today the only
    sensible way to develop software applications is from following an agile process. 
    Big design up front prior to development leveraging Sketches and Wire Frames (WF)
    in my view almost always leads to issues being found in development due to design’s
    not quite working 100%, or client finally having a working application and realizing
    that due to incomplete prototyping/user testing/or whatever, the original design
    the client “approved” wasn’t actually what they wanted.

    test certain ideas/patterns/frameworks prior to building the final solution. 
    In the UX space, as referenced in the articles above, design spikes should be
    expected.

    may need to re-evaluated on certain types of projects as it can sometimes be constraining
    to the overall delivery of the clients solution and thus the agility of a team.

    raising further thoughts around the UX process and PSD’s – particularly the reasoning
    to capture and “approve” how a design will respond in a static tool – Photoshop. 
    It’s interesting to see David reference [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) –
    who used Compass at Gloople?  Designers/Developers/both?'

    – pencil, paper, Photoshop, prototyping applications, etc.  For each project UX
    need to think about breaking the [shackles](http://cabgfx.com/2012/03/16/removing-waste-in-your-design-process/)
    they have previously be used to, and consider new way of delivering [responsive](http://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/responsive-web-design)
    solutions to clients.
