    action to motivate people, and competition. Without competition, self interest
    leads to monopolies and sloth, but workers compete with other workers, and companies
    compete with other companies, we get better workers and widgets.'

    good idea. Yet it is highly instructive what progressives think about competition
    and markets, that they approve of only highly constrained competition that basically
    neuters it. In Minnesota, we have 3 health care providers, and they all have highly
    regulated choice offerings. We have

    small payment for an uncertain large payment; in this case, I''m paying for many
    things I''ll certainly never use. If providers all have to provide identical service

    and so gave us all food insurance. We paid a special food contribution (not a
    tax!), and we were all entitled to a buffet offered by 3 different private companies.
    The buffet has to include traditional American fare, as well as Chinese, Mexican,
    Italian, Korean (dog), etc.--68 mandates in all. Most people don't want all the
    choices they pay for, but as they don't pay when they eat most people do not notice
    they are paying for things they don't eat. Now, as the food budget as a percent
    of GDP in America grows, and Americans are not any healthier than other developed
    countries, people ask, hey, can I just buy what I want to eat? The government
    tells you 'no', that is just a

    competition. This is what progressives think of as 'the market'. They convince
    themselves things will get better if they have even more top-down control (single
    payer) because then they could implement technological and logistic innovations
    (cutting out the darn middle man) that will lower costs, all the while keeping
    health care employment levels and compensation rates the same. One might be tempted
    to say, it can't get worse than the status quo, but that what the Russians said
    in 1917, and boy were they wrong.
