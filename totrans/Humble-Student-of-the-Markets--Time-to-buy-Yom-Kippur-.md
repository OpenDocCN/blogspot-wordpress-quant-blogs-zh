# Humble Student of the Markets: Time to buy Yom Kippur?

**Mid-week market update**

: There is a trader's adage, "Sell Rosh Hashanah, Buy Yom Kippur". As many in the Wall Street community are Jewish, staying out of the stock market during the Jewish high holidays may make some sense. Jewish traders and investors wind down at rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, and return after Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, which is today.

Indeed, this year's market weakness began just around Rosh Hashanah. Moreover, the market's decline was halted yesterday right at trend line support, and rallied today.

Is it time to buy Yom Kippur.
