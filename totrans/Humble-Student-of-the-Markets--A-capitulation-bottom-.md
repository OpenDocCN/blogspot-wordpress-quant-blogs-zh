# Humble Student of the Markets: A capitulation bottom?

**Mid-week market update:**

In my weekend post (see

[Buy the dip!](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2017/04/09/buy-the-dip-2/)

), I wrote that despite my tactical bullishness, "traders need to allow for a brief rally, followed by a sharp drop to a washout low before this shallow correction is over". We are finally seeing signs of an oversold market and a short-term capitulation.

There were a number of signs of a short-term bottom. On Monday, the VIX Index closed above its upper Bollinger Band (BB), indicating an oversold condition for the market (see 

[Three bottom spotting techniques for traders](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2017/03/22/three-bottom-spotting-techniques-for-traders/)

). As well, the SPX has been testing support located at its 50 day moving average (dma) in the last two days.
