    like unwieldy acronyms. The intent of this indicator is to gauge the future movements
    of the VIX in the coming week or so. In fact, the indicator has proven to be a
    useful tool for predicting VIX moves in the 1-4 week period. For better or for
    worse, I will not be trotting out a bunch of statistics to demonstrate how well
    the VWSI would have performed over various backtesting periods. Instead, consider
    the following scatter plot showing the two week ROI on various VWSI scores from
    2006 as reasonably representative of the predictive power the VWSI:'

    memory of the previous week’s scores. Therefore, even while the value of a score
    may have tradeable implications for a 1-4 week period, a new score is constructed
    from scratch each week. As a result, extreme VWSI scores rarely persist for more
    than one or two weeks.

    particularly if you keep in mind that the "bullish" and "bearish" labels apply
    to the VIX, not to the broader markets, which are usually negatively correlated
    with the VIX. The reading for the week ending 2/16/07 is +1, which is considered
    to be in the neutral zone. Last week’s VWSI reading was an even zero.
