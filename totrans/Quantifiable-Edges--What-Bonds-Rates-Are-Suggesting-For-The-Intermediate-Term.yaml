- en: The fact that bond rates were hitting a new high along with stocks on Monday
    is notable. Below is a study that last appeared in the 12/23/09 Subscriber Letter
    that examined this.

- en: Generally, higher interest rates make bonds a more attractive investment. This
    may lead people to forsake stocks in favor of lower risk returns with improved
    yield. Implications of this study appear to be longer-term in nature than we usually
    see. Traders may want to keep this study in mind in the coming weeks.
