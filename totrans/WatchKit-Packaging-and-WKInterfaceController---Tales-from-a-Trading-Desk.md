## WatchKit Packaging and WKInterfaceController

Having spent the last few (late) night with Xcode playing with WatchKit apps, there are a few interesting takeaways for any new WatchKit developers:

*   Packaging of WatchKit apps is nicely explained by this diagram ‚Äì target [structure](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/General/Conceptual/WatchKitProgrammingGuide/ConfiguringYourXcodeProject.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014969-CH2-SW1).¬†¬† The storyboards are separate from the actual WatchKit code (WKInterfaceController etc).¬† More interestingly, and least well publicised is the fact that Apple Watch also uses wifi if possible, [together](http://www.raywenderlich.com/94672/watchkit-faq) with the default Bluetooth LE to communicate with its paired iPhone.
*   Actions and [Outlets](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/General/Conceptual/Devpedia-CocoaApp/Outlet.html) work as you‚Äôd expect ‚Äì Control-Drag the UI widget from the storyboard into the [Assistant](http://www.raywenderlich.com/89562/watchkit-tutorial-with-swift-getting-started) editor page that contains the WKInterfaceController derived code, and the outlet will automatically be created and bound.¬† Essentially creating an IPC channel over Bluetooth to the paired iPhone üôÇ
*   Shared app group‚Äôs are relevant if you want the two processes to access the same files or data (e.g. preference)
*   [openParentApplication](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/WatchKit/Reference/WKInterfaceController_class/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/clm/WKInterfaceController/openParentApplication:reply:) looks like effectively an RPC call between the WatchKit extension sandbox process and the parent iOS process.
*   This tutorial offers [assistance](http://www.raywenderlich.com/96741/watchkit-tutorial-with-swift-tables-glances-and-handoff) on adding Glances and Handoff functionality to your WatchKit app.
