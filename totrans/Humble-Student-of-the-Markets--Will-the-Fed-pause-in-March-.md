# Humble Student of the Markets: Will the Fed pause in March?

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2019/01/will-fed-pause-in-march.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2019/01/will-fed-pause-in-march.html#0001-01-01)

In the wake of Powell's statements last Friday, the market now expects no changes in the Fed Funds rate this year, with a slight chance of a rate hike.

Contrast those expectations with the dot plot, which has penciled in two rate hikes this year.

The history of Fed policy is slow incremental changes. Has the market gone overboard on the dovish when it expects a change from two hikes to no hikes?

**A Special Announcement**

We told you so. We told you the market was going down.

Here is the track of

***Humble Student of the Markets***

, where we are neither perma-bulls nor perma-bears. Most recently, we have been correctly bullish since the correction of 2015, and turned cautious in August 2018 (see

August 5, 2018).

We were also timely at the 2009 bottom. We issued a call to buy beaten up low-priced stocks with high insider buying a week before the ultimate bottom (see
