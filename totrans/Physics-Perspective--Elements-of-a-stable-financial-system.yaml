- en: by Michael Cohrs of the Bank of England is worth a quick read and offers some
    pretty encouraging signs that authorities -- in the UK, at least -- are moving
    (slowly) toward financial regulations that seem pretty sensible and might really
    help avoid future crises or make them less frequent. I read it as a kind of wish
    list, but of wishes that are fairly realistic.

    greater awareness of economic and financial history, with the idea that we might
    prepare our minds better for the natural instabilities that seem to create crises
    so frequently:'

    develop better processes for anticipating the next problem – whether the problem
    is an asset bubble, poor risk mismanagement or a flawed or misunderstood financial
    product. And these are important steps to take. But it seems to me there is an
    inherent tendency for policymakers to re-fight the last war. As I said above,
    I am a believer that understanding the past provides a foundation on which to
    assess the future. But we shouldn’t pretend we can eliminate financial crises
    completely. Nor that the next crises will necessarily be a carbon copy of the
    last one.

    has its roots in the issues one sees in the financial crises of the past couple
    of hundred years or so. Virtually every type of financial institution has been
    the cause of a crisis at some point in history – country banks back in 1825, universal
    banks in 1931, small banks in the 1970s, savings and loan companies in the 1980s,
    international banks in the 1980s and 1990s (debt crises in Latin America and Asia
    respectively), and even a hedge fund in 1997.

    of 2007/2008\. The roll call included insurance companies (although thankfully
    not those in the UK) alongside investment banks as well as some more traditional
    commercial and mortgage banks. I find it hard to see a common thread (other than
    high leverage ratios) amongst the types of institutions that struggled or the
    mistakes that they made. It is not clear that the reforms we are putting into
    place today would have, or could have, averted all the problems faced in these
    crises. Therefore, experience tells me its origins are unlikely to be in an institution
    and from a product that is obvious to us now. ... I realize this uncertainty is
    rather unhelpful.

    that now , as we know how things can go wrong, we can probably perform a few engineering
    tricks and hence avoid further problems in the future. This was the facile belief
    furthered in the decade prior to the past crisis, especially in basic textbooks
    of economics and finance and research papers furthering belief in the inevitable
    "spiral to efficiency" of modern markets (infamously described in

    making finance more "sustainable." These include establishing simple rules by
    which large institutions can be wound down and let fail safely when they ought
    to (this might include using penalties or taxes to establish insurance funds beforehand
    to handle such events), making financial institutions LESS CONNECTED and changing
    the culture of finance as well so that financial institutions themselves "ensure
    they can be regulated." Ok, that final one may be a rather huge challenge.

    these things. Let's hope they can manage to put some of these principles in place,
    especially in some globally consistent way.
