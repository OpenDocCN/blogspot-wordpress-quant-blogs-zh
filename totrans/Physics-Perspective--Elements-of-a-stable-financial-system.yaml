- en: At the heart of much of the current policy debate is how the FPC, PRA and FCA
    develop better processes for anticipating the next problem – whether the problem
    is an asset bubble, poor risk mismanagement or a flawed or misunderstood financial
    product. And these are important steps to take. But it seems to me there is an
    inherent tendency for policymakers to re-fight the last war. As I said above,
    I am a believer that understanding the past provides a foundation on which to
    assess the future. But we shouldn’t pretend we can eliminate financial crises
    completely. Nor that the next crises will necessarily be a carbon copy of the
    last one.

  zh: 在当前许多政策辩论的核心是如何让金融政策委员会（FPC）、审慎监管局（PRA）和金融行为监管局（FCA）建立更好的流程来预见下一个问题——无论这个问题是资产泡沫、糟糕的风险管理、有缺陷的或是被误解的金融产品。这些都是重要的步骤。但似乎政策制定者有一种内在的倾向，那就是重蹈覆辙。如我前面所说，我相信了解过去可以为评估未来提供一个基础。但我们不应该假装我们能够完全消除金融危机。也不应该认为下一次危机一定会完全复制上一次。
- en: My anxiety about getting financial regulation to better mitigate future risks
    has its roots in the issues one sees in the financial crises of the past couple
    of hundred years or so. Virtually every type of financial institution has been
    the cause of a crisis at some point in history – country banks back in 1825, universal
    banks in 1931, small banks in the 1970s, savings and loan companies in the 1980s,
    international banks in the 1980s and 1990s (debt crises in Latin America and Asia
    respectively), and even a hedge fund in 1997.

  zh: 我对金融监管能更好地缓解未来风险的担忧源于过去一两百年金融危机中看到的问题。在历史上，几乎每种类型的金融机构在某个时刻都曾是危机的原因——1825年的乡村银行、1931年的全能银行、1970年代的小银行、1980年代的储蓄贷款公司、1980年代和1990年代的国际银行（分别对应拉丁美洲和亚洲的债务危机），甚至1997年还有一个对冲基金。
- en: Pretty much all types of financial institution got involved in the problems
    of 2007/2008\. The roll call included insurance companies (although thankfully
    not those in the UK) alongside investment banks as well as some more traditional
    commercial and mortgage banks. I find it hard to see a common thread (other than
    high leverage ratios) amongst the types of institutions that struggled or the
    mistakes that they made. It is not clear that the reforms we are putting into
    place today would have, or could have, averted all the problems faced in these
    crises. Therefore, experience tells me its origins are unlikely to be in an institution
    and from a product that is obvious to us now. ... I realize this uncertainty is
    rather unhelpful.

    that now , as we know how things can go wrong, we can probably perform a few engineering
    tricks and hence avoid further problems in the future. This was the facile belief
    furthered in the decade prior to the past crisis, especially in basic textbooks

- en: Cohrs goes on to discuss a number of ideas all being pursued with the idea of
    making finance more "sustainable." These include establishing simple rules by
    which large institutions can be wound down and let fail safely when they ought
    to (this might include using penalties or taxes to establish insurance funds beforehand
    to handle such events), making financial institutions LESS CONNECTED and changing
    the culture of finance as well so that financial institutions themselves "ensure
    they can be regulated." Ok, that final one may be a rather huge challenge.
