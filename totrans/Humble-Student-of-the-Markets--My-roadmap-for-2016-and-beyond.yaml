    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    thought that it would be useful for me to review my outlook for the remainder
    of 2016 and into early 2017\. I would characterize it as a roadmap, rather than
    a forecast, as there are far too many moving parts for this to be an actual forecast.

- en: My base case scenario calls for the US equity market to form a cyclical top
    in 2016\. The market is likely to rise and make marginal new highs this year,
    led by late cycle sectors such as capital goods and resource extraction. As inflationary
    pressures become evident, the Fed will respond with a series of rate hikes, which
    have the potential to push the American economy into recession. With European
    growth still fragile and Chinese growth decelerating and beset by a debt overhang,
    such Fed actions could drag there rest of the world into recession as well. Risky
    assets such as stocks would not behave well in such an environment and a major
    downleg in stock prices is well within the realm of possibility.

    my roadmap. On one hand, the lack of gross under-valuation is unlikely to see
    stock prices rally significantly for the rest of this year. On the other hand,
    past history has shown that the market has been able to advance even under adverse
    conditions of over-valuation. Therefore a scenario of modest market gains, followed
    by a loss of macro momentum from changes in Fed policy, is well within the realm
    of possibility.'
