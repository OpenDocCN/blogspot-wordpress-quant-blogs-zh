    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    thought that it would be useful for me to review my outlook for the remainder
    of 2016 and into early 2017\. I would characterize it as a roadmap, rather than
    a forecast, as there are far too many moving parts for this to be an actual forecast.

- en: My base case scenario calls for the US equity market to form a cyclical top
    in 2016\. The market is likely to rise and make marginal new highs this year,
    led by late cycle sectors such as capital goods and resource extraction. As inflationary
    pressures become evident, the Fed will respond with a series of rate hikes, which
    have the potential to push the American economy into recession. With European
    growth still fragile and Chinese growth decelerating and beset by a debt overhang,
    such Fed actions could drag there rest of the world into recession as well. Risky
    assets such as stocks would not behave well in such an environment and a major
    downleg in stock prices is well within the realm of possibility.

  zh: 我的基本情景预测是，美国股票市场将在2016年形成一个周期性顶部。今年市场可能会上涨并创下边缘新高，由资本商品和资源提取等后期周期性行业引领。随着通胀压力变得明显，美联储将回应一系列加息，这有可能将美国经济推入衰退。由于欧洲增长仍然脆弱，中国增长放缓且受到债务过剩的困扰，这样的美联储行动可能会将世界经济拖入衰退。在这种环境下，风险资产如股票表现不会好，股票价格的大幅下跌完全是在可能的范围之内。

    my roadmap. On one hand, the lack of gross under-valuation is unlikely to see
    stock prices rally significantly for the rest of this year. On the other hand,
    past history has shown that the market has been able to advance even under adverse
    conditions of over-valuation. Therefore a scenario of modest market gains, followed
    by a loss of macro momentum from changes in Fed policy, is well within the realm
    of possibility.'

  zh: 这表明市场正在大约公平价值进行交易，与我的路线图是一致的。一方面，缺乏显著的低估不太可能导致股票价格在今年剩余时间大幅上涨。另一方面，过去的历史表明，即使在高估的不利条件下，市场也能够前进。因此，一个温和的市场上涨，随后因美联储政策变动而失去宏观动力的情景，完全是在可能的范围之内。
