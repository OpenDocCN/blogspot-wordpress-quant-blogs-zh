    asset allocation, model which uses trend following techniques as applied to commodity
    and global stock market prices to generates a composite Risk-On/Risk-Off signal
    (risk-on, risk-off or neutral). I have begun updating readers on the Trend Model
    signals on a weekly basis and via Twitter @humblestudent as new developments occur.

    of the signal, which are indicated by the arrows, overlaid on top of a chart of
    the SP 500\. You can think of the blue up arrows, which occurred when the trend
    signal changed from negative to positive, as buy signals and the red down arrows,
    which occurred when the trend signal changed from positive to negative, as sell
    signals.

    there is no substitute for actual performance. As a proof of concept, I started
    to manage a small account that traded long, inverse and leveraged ETFs on the
    major US market averages and, on occasion, sector and industry ETFs. Trading decisions
    were based on Trend Model signals combined with some short-term sentiment indicators.
    The inception date of the account was September 30, 2013, For more details on
    how the Trend Model or how the account is managed, see my post

    is intended to be an absolute return vehicle. While I do show the SPY total return,
    which includes re-invested dividends, for illustrative purposes, the SP 500 is
    not an appropriate benchmark for measuring the performance of this modeling technique.

    of twists and turns". The rest of 2015 will be a key test for this model and trading
    strategy if the environment is to be as volatile as I expect it to be.

    to be promising for this model longer term. I am comfortable with attributing
    the recent return hiccup as a characteristic of a difficult environment for this
    class of model, rather than anything fundamentally wrong with the modeling approach.
