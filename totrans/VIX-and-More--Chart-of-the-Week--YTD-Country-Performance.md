# VIX and More: Chart of the Week: YTD Country Performance

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/09/chart-of-week-ytd-country-performance.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/09/chart-of-week-ytd-country-performance.html#0001-01-01)

In this week’s [chart of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week), I wish simply to make two points:

1.  If you are focusing your investments in U.S. stocks, you are likely underperforming 80% of the global investment world so far in 2009

2.  [FINVIZ.com](http://finviz.com/) has some excellent summary graphics for geographical and sector/industry group performance and other metrics

The chart below is one such example.

The quick takeaway? Get global!
