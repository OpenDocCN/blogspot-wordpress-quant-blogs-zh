    that panic episode, investors found that asset class return correlations converged
    to 1. All assets moved together because it was one giant risk trade. Even balanced
    funds failed to diversify risk.

    or panic episodes, I analytically identified assets, i.e. risk-free US Treasuries,
    as the safety trade - without reference to any historical correlations.

    is not prone to the same risks as the others you already hold, then buying it
    will reduce your overall risk. If it is subject to exactly the same risk, then
    buying it is pointless, even if it is in a different asset class or country. Rather
    than balance between stocks and bonds, for example, it might be better to balance
    the risks of inflation and deflation, which both affect stocks and bonds. Diversification
    itself is as good an idea as ever. You should not put all your eggs in one basket.
    But in the globalized world, you can put your egg into a different country an
    still find that it is in the same basket.

- en: The postmodern quantitative techniques suggested as extensions of mean-variance
    analysis, however, exploit diversification as a general method. ***Although diversification
    is most effective in extracting risk premia over reasonably long investment horizons
    and is a key component of sound risk management, it is ill-suited for loss control
    in severe market downturns***. Hedging and insurance are better suited for loss
    control over short horizons. ***In particular, dynamic asset allocation techniques
    deal efficiently with general loss constraints because they preserve access to
    the upside***. Diversification is still very useful in these strategies, as the
    performance of well-diversified building blocks helps finance the cost of insurance
    strategies.

    dampens volatility and returns? Or during extreme crisis events when standard
    diversification techniques break down?
