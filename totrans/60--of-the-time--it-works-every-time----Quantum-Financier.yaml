- en: The blogosphere is a very interesting microcosm of the trading world. Many of
    my older readers will no doubt remember the glory days of “short-term mean-reversion”.
    By which I mean of course the multitude of posts (including several from yours
    truly), about RSI2, DV2 and the like. Around 2010 this type of strategy was quite
    successful and many people put their twist on it posting their results.

    trust of the community turned to the relatively new volatility ETF space. It was
    glorious; backtests were run, strategies were tweaked, whole websites tracking
    the strategies popped up and simulated equity curves went to the moon. Life was
    great. Then on Monday 2018-02-05 the music didn’t just slow down, it stopped.
    $XIV, the workhorse of many such strategies, there is no nice way to say this;
    blew up. From what I can see, its demise was met with mixed emotions. Twitter
    traders with $0.00 AUM knew it all along and were obviously already short $XIV
    from the high for size. People with subscription strategies either patted themselves
    on the back for side-stepping the reaper *this time*, or went AWOL to avoid having
    to take ownership for the losses incurred by their subscribers. My personal favorite
    are people selling strategies that usually held $XIV shares as their de-factor
    short-volatility security declaring that its demise is a non-issue; $UVXY will
    do the trick just as well!

    The idea that because it was side-stepped this time the next face-ripping event
    will as well is simply preposterous. Selling volatility is something you do with
    other people’s money. It’s a great business, you pocket the recurring fees and
    performance incentives and when the music stop and you lose your client’s money
    they take all the loss. As Ron burgundy would put it, 60% of the time, it works
    every time. We would all be so lucky to find such asymmetric payoff propositions
    for ourselves, I share in the wins now, you get the blowout later, thanks for
    playing.

- en: The vast majority of such systems I have encountered in the blogosphere were
    based on term structure signals to determine whether long or short volatility
    exposure has tailwind. In this particular instance, thankfully for some, the signal
    to get out of the short happened before the spike. Why should it do that next
    time, or the time after that?

- en: I’d love to hear your thinking on the subject, esteemed reader. I know short
    volatility is a popular trade and has been for some time. Are you still going
    to do it? Are you worried about events such as the one form this past couple days
    being an issue in the future? Do you want to pay me a monthly fee for putting
    you in a trade that has an expected value of 0?

  zh: 亲爱的读者，我很想听听你对这个问题的想法。我知道做空波动性是一种受欢迎的交易方式，而且已经有一段时间了。你还打算继续吗？你是否担心像过去几天那样的事件会成为将来的问题？你愿意每月向我支付费用，让我帮你进行一笔预期价值为
    0 的交易吗？
- en: I would be down with that if I could sleep at night knowing you take all the
    risk and I will be the only one left with any profits to show for when the chips
    land at the end. Unfortunately, I could not live with myself. For those interested,
    you can look on collective2 but make sure you filter the strategies by performance
    excluding this week.

  zh: 如果我能安心睡个好觉，知道你承担所有的风险，而我将是唯一一个在最后收获利润的人，我会欣然接受这一切。不幸的是，我无法自欺欺人。对于那些感兴趣的人，你可以在
    collective2 上查看，但请确保通过绩效来筛选策略，不包括本周的。
