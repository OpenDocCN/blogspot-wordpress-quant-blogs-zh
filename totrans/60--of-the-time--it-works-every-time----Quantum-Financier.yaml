- en: The blogosphere is a very interesting microcosm of the trading world. Many of
    my older readers will no doubt remember the glory days of “short-term mean-reversion”.
    By which I mean of course the multitude of posts (including several from yours
    truly), about RSI2, DV2 and the like. Around 2010 this type of strategy was quite
    successful and many people put their twist on it posting their results.

  zh: 博客圈是交易世界的一个非常有趣的微观宇宙。我的许多老读者毫无疑问会记得“短期均值回归”的辉煌时期。当然，我指的是包括几篇我的在内的大量帖子，涉及RSI2、DV2等内容。大约在2010年，这种策略相当成功，许多人都对此加以改进，并发布了他们的结果。
- en: Then while this humble publication went into hibernation the collective brain
    trust of the community turned to the relatively new volatility ETF space. It was
    glorious; backtests were run, strategies were tweaked, whole websites tracking
    the strategies popped up and simulated equity curves went to the moon. Life was
    great. Then on Monday 2018-02-05 the music didn’t just slow down, it stopped.
    $XIV, the workhorse of many such strategies, there is no nice way to say this;
    blew up. From what I can see, its demise was met with mixed emotions. Twitter
    traders with $0.00 AUM knew it all along and were obviously already short $XIV
    from the high for size. People with subscription strategies either patted themselves
    on the back for side-stepping the reaper *this time*, or went AWOL to avoid having
    to take ownership for the losses incurred by their subscribers. My personal favorite
    are people selling strategies that usually held $XIV shares as their de-factor
    short-volatility security declaring that its demise is a non-issue; $UVXY will
    do the trick just as well!

  zh: 然后，当这个谦逊的出版物进入休眠时，社区的集体智囊团转向了相对较新的波动率ETF领域。那是光辉的时刻；进行了回测，调整了策略，整个网站跟踪策略的情况涌现出来，模拟的股权曲线飙升。生活是美好的。然后，在2018年02月05日星期一，音乐不仅放慢了，而且停止了。$XIV，许多此类策略的工作马，没有好的方式来说这件事；崩溃了。从我看到的情况来看，它的终结引起了不同的情绪。推特交易者没有资产管理规模，早就知道一切，并且显然已经从高处大规模做空了$XIV。订阅策略的人要么为此次绕过死神而自我陶醉，要么消失得无影无踪，以避免为他们的订户蒙受的损失负责。我个人最喜欢的是，那些通常持有$XIV股票作为其事实上的短期波动性证券的人宣称，它的终结不成问题；$UVXY同样有效！
- en: This demonstrate such a blatant lack of trading IQ I struggle to put into words.
    The idea that because it was side-stepped this time the next face-ripping event
    will as well is simply preposterous. Selling volatility is something you do with
    other people’s money. It’s a great business, you pocket the recurring fees and
    performance incentives and when the music stop and you lose your client’s money
    they take all the loss. As Ron burgundy would put it, 60% of the time, it works
    every time. We would all be so lucky to find such asymmetric payoff propositions
    for ourselves, I share in the wins now, you get the blowout later, thanks for
    playing.

  zh: 这展示了如此明显的交易智商缺失，我很难用言语表达。由于这次被绕过了，下一次面瘫事件也会被绕过的想法简直荒谬。卖出波动率是你用别人的钱做的事情。这是一项很棒的业务，你可以获得持续的费用和绩效激励，当音乐停止时你失去了客户的钱，他们承担所有的损失。正如Ron
    Burgundy所说，60%的时间，它每次都有效。我们都会很幸运，找到这样的非对称回报提议，我现在分享胜利，你以后遭受重创，谢谢参与。
- en: The vast majority of such systems I have encountered in the blogosphere were
    based on term structure signals to determine whether long or short volatility
    exposure has tailwind. In this particular instance, thankfully for some, the signal
    to get out of the short happened before the spike. Why should it do that next
    time, or the time after that?

  zh: 我在博客圈中遇到的大部分这类系统都是基于期限结构信号的，以确定是做多还是做空波动率暴露是否有追随风。在这个特定情况中，值得庆幸的是，短期退出的信号发生在暴涨之前。为什么下次会这样做，或者下下次呢？
- en: I’d love to hear your thinking on the subject, esteemed reader. I know short
    volatility is a popular trade and has been for some time. Are you still going
    to do it? Are you worried about events such as the one form this past couple days
    being an issue in the future? Do you want to pay me a monthly fee for putting
    you in a trade that has an expected value of 0?

  zh: 亲爱的读者，我很想听听你对这个问题的想法。我知道做空波动性是一种受欢迎的交易方式，而且已经有一段时间了。你还打算继续吗？你是否担心像过去几天那样的事件会成为将来的问题？你愿意每月向我支付费用，让我帮你进行一笔预期价值为
    0 的交易吗？
- en: I would be down with that if I could sleep at night knowing you take all the
    risk and I will be the only one left with any profits to show for when the chips
    land at the end. Unfortunately, I could not live with myself. For those interested,
    you can look on collective2 but make sure you filter the strategies by performance
    excluding this week.

    collective2 上查看，但请确保通过绩效来筛选策略，不包括本周的。
