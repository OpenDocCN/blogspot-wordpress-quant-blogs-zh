- en: I get the feeling that we are approaching the end of an era. Independent central
    banks appeared to solve the problem of defeating inflation, but there was always
    a democratic issue. We have now reached the stage when central banks are being
    asked to do things that politicians know that the electrorate would not be willing
    to support, a trend that arguably goes back to the Mexican bailout of the mid-1990s.
    It does not seem sustainable.

    and keeping banks on life support as Europe’s debt crisis persists." Now those
    warnings of those risks may be materializing as beyond Ireland lie the other periphery eurozone

- en: One of the roles of monetary policy played by central banks is to act as a counterweight
    to fiscal policy, which tends to be more politically driven. While I have expressed
    my own concerns about the effectiveness of QE2 and I do believe that the Fed's
    operations are overly opaque and audits may be beneficial, I would nevertheless
    support the principle of central bank independence.

    policy can no longer be the counterweight to fiscal policy. Down that road is
    economic instability, banana republics and Zimbabwe.
