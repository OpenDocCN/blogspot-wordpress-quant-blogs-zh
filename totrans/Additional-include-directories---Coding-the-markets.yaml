- en: The extra include directories one adds working with a large C++ codebase in
    Visual C++ were a real pain in VC6.  The project settings had a small one line
    edit field. Often it was easier to ctrl-C/ctrl-V to a real editor to change the
    include path. Now VC8 has added a little ellipsis button at the end of the edit
    field which brings up a nice dialog, rather like Tools/Options/Directories always
    had. So simple, but it makes so much difference to working in the IDE.
