# WPF BDD – Options? | Tales from a Trading Desk

## WPF BDD – Options?

I’m back in WPF land for a bit of a code kick around – another aeroplane coding challenge.  Thus, since its the usual spike project, I thought I might as well update to Visual Studio [2013](http://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs).  Given I’ve for Scala/Java on the server side of my spike with the usual cukes behaviour testing, I’m at the junction of deciding what [BDD](http://www.natontesting.com/2011/08/27/step-by-step-example-of-bdding-a-wpf-app-with-cucumber-rspec-ironruby-and-bewildr/) framework to use in WPF land.  Nat’s somewhat old article on BDD, “Step-by-step example of BDD’ing a WPF app with Cucumber, RSpec, IronRuby and Bewildr” provides one option.  Other old BDD options include [Aubergine](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/43632/Getting-started-with-BDD-Behavior-Driven-Developme) and [NSpec](http://nspec.org/).

So I’m guessing I should go the [NSpec](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dn385712.aspx) road for my WPF application, especially as Ted has an [article](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dn385712.aspx) on NSpec in the MSDN September 2013.
