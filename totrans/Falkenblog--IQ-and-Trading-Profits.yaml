    (Linnainmaa & Keloharju), took data from Finnish military IQ tests, and combined
    them with transactional data on the Helsinki Stock Exchange. The paper is cleanly

- en: This study analyzes whether high IQ investors exhibit superior investment performance.
    It combines equity return, trade, and limit order book data with two decades of
    scores from an intelligence test administered to nearly every Finnish male of
    draft age. Controlling for wealth, trading frequency, age, and determinants of
    the cross-section of stock returns on each day, we find that high IQ investors
    exhibit superior stock-picking skills, particularly for purchases, which earn
    up to 11% more per year than the purchases of below average IQ nvestors.

    of an asset's risk, it was a function of the investor's smarts? It seems plausible,

    Gold, day-trading, futures, are not really attractive in themselves, but rather
    if they are consistent with your relative skills.

    point return advantage, looking at their picks on day t-2, and return on day t.
    This annualizes to 11% (252*.00044), but that isn't very realistic, because you
    can't trade that much. The advantage peters out, as after two months the return
    advantage is only 0.5 basis points.

    to make sense, but one should remember investing is not a sprint, but a marathon.
    Grinblatt and company show higher IQ investors are more diversified, and trade
    less, than their stupid counterparts, so it does seem like those who trade benefit
    from smarts.

    because everyone in this paper is trading all the time, for edges of basis points,
    when the transaction cost merely on the bid-ask is 100 basis points. The really
    really smart (wise?) people do not gamble at all, because they know the long-run
    house edge kills any edge they might have. In trading, trying to make money with
    trade horizons less than a year, the only way to make consistent money is to be
    an insider, why brokers have nice yachts ('
