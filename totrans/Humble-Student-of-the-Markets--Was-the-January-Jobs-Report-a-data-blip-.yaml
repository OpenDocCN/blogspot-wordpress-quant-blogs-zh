- en: I've been trying to make sense of the blowout January Jobs Report. BLS reported
    a Nonfarm Payroll gain of 517,000, which was an off-the-charts surprise compared
    to market expectations of 185,000\. Whenever large surprises occur, it makes me
    think that the report represents a data blip.

    adjusted NFP report (blue). The non-seasonally adjusted figure (red) shows that
    January usually sees large layoffs, and job losses were lower than normal.
