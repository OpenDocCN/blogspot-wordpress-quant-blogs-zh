    but totally caught Wall Street flatfooted, there's a lot of tut-tut-ing about
    how they should have known that unexpected things can happen. In the latest,

    Wall Street firms made the same mistake suggests that it was not obvious--these
    people may be rich and morally inferior to pundits, but that does not make them
    stupid. On the outside, I'm not sure how anyone was to know these firms all were
    making this trade, and I hope transparency aimed at that end is part of any new
    regulation. But "not expecting the unexpected", if not a tautology, means in practice
    we under appreciate tail events.

    200 at the money, to 350 for out-of-the-money puts, which indicates a massive
    amount of market expectations of a large jump to zero. Methinks that the market
    if anything is too enamored with tail events.

    asymmetric distributions, in general. The essence of systematic risks is more
    nuanced than that.
