# Quantitative Trading: My new book on Algorithmic Trading is out

> 来源：[http://epchan.blogspot.com/2013/05/my-new-book-on-algorithmic-trading-is.html#0001-01-01](http://epchan.blogspot.com/2013/05/my-new-book-on-algorithmic-trading-is.html#0001-01-01)

A reader (Hat tip: Ken) told me that my new book

[Algorithmic Trading: Winning Strategies and Their Rationale](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1118460146/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1118460146&linkCode=as2&tag=quantitativet-20)

 is now available for purchase at Amazon.com. The difference with my previous book? A lot more sample strategies with an emphasis on their "rationale", and more advanced techniques. It covers stocks, futures, and FX. A big thank-you to my editors, reviewers, and you, the reader, for your on-going support.

And when you are done with it, please post a review on Amazon whether you like it or hate it!

Also, I am now offering a live online course on

[Backtesting](http://www.epchan.com/my-workshops/)

 in June. It covers in excruciating details the various nuances of conducting a correct backtest and the numerous pitfalls one can encounter when backtesting different types of strategies and asset classes. For syllabus and registration details, please visit my
