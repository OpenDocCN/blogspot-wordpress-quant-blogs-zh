      During the trip, I’ve been thinking further about the following problem:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We are interested in determining a representative distribution for some financial
    factor
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: suppose we start with start with a “universal” high-dimensional joint distribution
    of all random variables that might possibly have relevance to the probability
    of some financial factor
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: suppose that the number of variables in the universal joint distribution is
    high enough that the distribution is sparse relative to the sampled data.  We
    need to reduce the number of degrees of freedom.

    representative modes and distribution shape?

- en: We should expect clustering around 1 or more modes
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Variables with little impact will not introduce new modes or substantially alter
    the shape of the distribution
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Adding a new low-impact variable (dimension) should just stretch the existing
    modes uniformly along the new dimension

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: applying a measure to each, determining the degree of information within, select
    one that maximizes information and penalizes for number of variables
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first step can possibly be shortcut by reducing incrementally, but may not
    find the global optimum.   The notion of “information” also needs to be defined.
      I’ll post more later on this.

- en: Another approach would be to formulate as an expectation maximisation problem,
    but I have not worked out how this would be done.
