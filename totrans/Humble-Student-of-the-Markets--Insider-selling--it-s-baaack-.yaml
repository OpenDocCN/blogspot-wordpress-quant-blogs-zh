    Explanation #2 is a perfectly plausible reason for the rash of insider activity
    as 2012 draws to a close. In that case, I would wait for the insider activity
    data in January to see if insiders are indeed selling because of deteriorating
    corporate fundamentals, or for tax related reasons.'

    way, we have an update on insider activity from Vickers - and it's bad news for
    the bulls. The ratio of insider sales to buys has surged from 6.67 to 1 in December,
    which was already at levels for bulls to be concerned, to over 9 to 1 today, according

    Street. "Insiders are waving the cautionary flag in an increasingly aggressive
    manner."'

    sell-buy ratio from Vickers stands at 5-to-1, also the most bearish since early
    2012\. What's more, the last time this ratio was at these levels was June 2011,
