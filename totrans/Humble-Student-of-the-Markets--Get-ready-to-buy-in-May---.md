# Humble Student of the Markets: Get ready to buy in May...

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2024/02/get-ready-to-buy-in-may.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2024/02/get-ready-to-buy-in-may.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models** 

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post, 

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The 

**Trend Asset Allocation Model**

 is an asset allocation model that applies trend-following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity prices. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. The performance and full details of a model portfolio based on the out-of-sample signals of the Trend Model can be found

[here](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/trend-model-report-card/)

.

My inner trader uses a 

**trading model**

, which is a blend of price momentum (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa). Subscribers receive real-time alerts of model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of the email alerts is updated weekly

. The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that began in March 2016 is shown below.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Buy equities (Last changed from “sell” on 28-Jul-2023)*
*   Trend Model signal: Bullish (Last changed from “neutral” on 28-Jul-2023)*
*   Trading model: Neutral (Last changed from “bullish” on 24-Jan-2024)*

#### A 2024 Roadmap

A combination of factors is converging to draw a stock market roadmap for 2024\. Instead of the more familiar seasonal pattern of “sell in May and go away”, I would advocate a strategy of buying in May. The main factors that affect this roadmap are election year seasonality and the timing of the first rate cut.

Historically, the market has traced out a choppy pattern until May, followed by a rally into September, a pause and a rally into year-end. The market has so far outrun its seasonal pattern in 2024, with the warning that February has historically been weak during election years, according to
