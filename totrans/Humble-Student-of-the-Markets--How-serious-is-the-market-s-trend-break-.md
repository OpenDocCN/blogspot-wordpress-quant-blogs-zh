# Humble Student of the Markets: How serious is the market's trend break?

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2024/04/how-serious-is-markets-trend-break.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2024/04/how-serious-is-markets-trend-break.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models** 

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post, 

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The 

**Trend Asset Allocation Model**

 is an asset allocation model that applies trend-following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity prices. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. The performance and full details of a model portfolio based on the out-of-sample signals of the Trend Model can be found

[here](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/trend-model-report-card/)

.

My inner trader uses a **trading model**, which is a blend of price momentum (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa). Subscribers receive real-time alerts of model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of the email alerts is updated weekly [here](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/trading-track-record/). The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that began in March 2016 is shown below.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Buy equities (Last changed from “sell” on 28-Jul-2023)*
*   Trend Model signal: Bullish (Last changed from “neutral” on 28-Jul-2023)*
*   Trading model: Bearish (Last changed from “neutral” on 15-Mar-2024)*

#### What rotating correction?

It finally happened. I’ve been warning about the extended nature of the market advance since late January, and the pullback seems to have begun. The S&P 500 violated a rising trend line that stretches back to November last Thursday. Friday’s market rebound didn’t help as it left the index below the rising trend line.

At the same time, market breadth hadn’t broadened out since mid-January. While I had hopes that market weakness in one group would be offset by strength in another, the rotating correction scenario isn’t working out.

Initial support for the S&P 500 can be found at the 50 dma at about 5080, with secondary support at the NVIDIA earnings report price gap at around 5000 and strong support at the breakout turned support at about 4800.
