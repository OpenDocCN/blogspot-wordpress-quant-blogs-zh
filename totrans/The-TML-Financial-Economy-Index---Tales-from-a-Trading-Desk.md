## The TML Financial Economy Index

Each morning I walk past a TM Lewin shirt [shop](http://www.tmlewin.co.uk/) – its mostly the shop near Bank subway.  Like so many shops, TM Lewis have the usual offer/sale marketing in the window. Over the last 2 years based on non-statistical data 🙂 I’ve come to the conclusion that you can tell how well the UK economy is doing based on the current “sale” price of shirts.  The general shirt “sale” index seems to fluctuate between 5 shirts for £100, and 1 shirt for £80.  Anyway, curious if anyone else has their own made-up commute index 🙂
