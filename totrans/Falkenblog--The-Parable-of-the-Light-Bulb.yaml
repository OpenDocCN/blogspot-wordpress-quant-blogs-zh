    old. We were on vacation in our family truckster and I was just thinking to myself
    for hours looking out the window at the scenery going by. I came to the realization
    that life was meaningless, and I just felt incredibly depressed for the next couple
    of hours. While I generally just avoided the issue growing up, eventually I reconciled
    my nihilism using the standard rationale that we create meaning by finding interesting
    things to do and doing them well--World of Warcraft, baking, discussing philosophy,
    parenting. This puts your life into a network of interactions valued by others--perhaps
    only those in the future--that makes your life part of a story as opposed to a
    random sequence of events.

    something that over time producers less enjoyment because of its irrelevance to
    others; no one wants to be the guy who spent his whole life becoming expert in
    something later found to be a dead end, not valued by anyone. This is a nontrivial
    problem for academics who receive the weak signal of peer enthusiasm, as fads
    are just as common in academics as in financial markets, and many times I have
    heard people working on abstruse theory note that

    doing this, as I doubt women's studies professors, string theorists, or those
    doing Global Warming research will find their output valued, but any middle aged
    practitioner has the equivalent of golden handcuffs and can't reject his life's
    work. It must have been awful to have been a 50 year old Marxist in 1989\.

    and put in the cabinet for months and months. Alone and in the dark, in a way,
    it could feel that life, alone and in the dark, is a stupid, futile, pointless
    exercise.

    all of a sudden it becomes useful; it serves a purpose, and all of the parts and
    pieces work together harmoniously to serve as a conduit for light. It is now doing
    what it was designed for, it is performing the job it was built for. This might
    be the same as what can happen with human beings.

    It would be like the lightbulb taking up yoga or canvas painting in an effort
    to "create" meaning. While this might work for a little while as a temporary distraction
    and amusement, the light bulb would not experience permanent relief until it became
    plugged into the socket, or performed the exact function it was built for.
