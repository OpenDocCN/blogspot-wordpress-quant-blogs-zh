    up with markets and ascribing the problem to weird unexplainable reasons such
    as portfolio derivative re-balancing and negative drift. I thought it would be
    nice to revisit the concept of path asymmetry. Although there are many different
    definitions of price asymmetry (econometrics for example), in this case I'm simply
    referring to the asymmetrical nature of percentage price movements vs dollar movements
    and their final cumulative outcome given any arbitrary path.

    underlying series may move a certain direction, yet, both the ultra short and
    ultra long series both finish below the underlying over the long run. What exactly
    is path asymmetry? Some traders might be familiar with the notion that if you
    lose some percentage of your account, like 50%, that you need more than 50% to
    make up for the loss. That is an example of path asymmetry (I should note someone
    also mentioned it's an example of Seigel's paradox).

    2x counterparts. Suppose a stock moves from 100dollars to 80 and back to 100 again--
    break-even. The move from 100 to 80 on a percentage basis, was a 20% loss. However,
    to recoup that amount, we need to solve for 80*(1+x)=100; the answer is 25%, not
    20%. This means even though the dollar amount is identical for both moves (20dollars
    down and up), the %amount is not. That is an example of path asymmetry. How does
    this affect the 2X ultra Leveraged ETFs? Well, since each ETF is designed to track
    twice the daily move of the underlying, the the +2x ETF will move 40% down, then
    it will move 50% back up, for a net dollar ending value of 90 dollars. The -2x
    ETF will move up 2x or 40% to 140, and then retrace -50% leaving it at only 70
    dollars. Notice in both cases, each ultra ETF ends up below the underlying price.
    It is the simple mechanics of path dependency and asymmetry that account for this,
    even with perfect 2x leveraging. It is important to take into account path dependencies
    when dealing with any leveraged product, including hedging.

    which does add merit to the original question. More on this is explained succinctly
