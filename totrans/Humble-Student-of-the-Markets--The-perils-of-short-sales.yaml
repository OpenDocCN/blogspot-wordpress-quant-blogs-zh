    output to initiate short positions, instead of switching to another asset class.
    (To review, the model is an asset allocation model that uses trend following principles
    to switch between asset classes, namely commodities, the inflation hedge, US Treasury
    long bond, the deflation hedge, and equities, the neutral position.)

    go short for risk control reasons. Simply put, asset classes tend to be more volatile
    when they are in bear markets and rallies tend to be vicious, such as the current
    one in response to the European rescue package. Thus, the investor pays for higher
    returns (even if he is right) in the form of higher volatility. Short sales are
    more suitable for traders seeking to make a directional bet for short-term profit,
    or for hedgers, e.g. paired trading.'

    after a signal is given at the closing price and there are no commissions or trading
    costs. If the model goes to cash, a 0% return is assumed. Returns on the S&P 500
    are total returns, as proxied by SPY. The chart below shows the results of the
    backtest, which began on December 31, 1999 and goes to the present. For the entire
    period, a buy and hold strategy would have returned -0.2%. If you had used the
    timing model only to go long, the return would have been 0.5%. A long and short
    strategy performed best at 2.7%.

    classes of models are good at avoiding much of the brutal downdrafts of bear markets.
    The long only strategy beat the buy-and-hold strategy by 0.7%, but downside volatility
    was significantly lower than the benchmark. While the long/short strategy was
    the best, that performance was achieved at the price of much greater volatility.
    The incremental volatility was experienced during periods when the model went
    short, i.e. during bear markets.

    should be intuitively obvious to traders. After all, the VIX Index, which is a
    measure of implied volatility, tends to rise when the stock market is falling.

    classes. The chart below shows the standard deviation of different asset classes
    for different assets over differing time periods: DJIA (from 1928 to the present),
    AGG as a proxy for the US bond market (from 2003) and the CRB Index (from 1999).
    [Yes I know the time periods are different and I am not exactly comparing apples
    to apples, but I want to study the behavior of different asset classes during
    bull and bear phases.] I defined a bull market as when the index was above its
    200 day moving average and a bear market as when it was below.'

    than bull markets. Technicians have an adage that confirms this observation: "Bottoms
    are events. Tops are processes." In other words, the price action at bottoms tend
    to be emotional, spiky affairs - which is what account for the volatility.'

    Even if the shorts are right, their higher returns come at the price of greater
    volatility.

- en: In an asset allocation model such as the Inflation-Deflation Timer, a better
    way to get higher risk-adjusted returns is to move into a more favorable asset
    class when the trend following model flashes a “go short” signal. For instance,
    an investor can get better risk-adjusted buying the negatively correlated asset,
    such as the US Treasury long bond, instead of shorting commodities when we see
    a “deflation” signal.
