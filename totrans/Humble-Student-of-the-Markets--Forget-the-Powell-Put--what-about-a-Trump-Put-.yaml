- en: I have been engaged in a running debate about the possibility of a Trump Put
    in the market. My friend believes that Trump is likely to pull back from a full-scale
    trade war with China, as it would tank the stock market and increase the likelihood
    of a recession. The Republicans lost the House in 2018 with the unemployment rate
    at 3.7%. A recession in 2019 or 2020 will not only lose them the White House,
    but probably both houses of Congress. Trump wants to avoid that scenario at all
    costs.

    Xi Jinping, Mr. Trump has questioned why the markets weren’t reacting more positively
    to the news of the potential breakthrough with Beijing. In consulting with advisers,
    he remained convinced that the volatility wasn’t his own doing, but rather, the
    product of the Federal Reserve’s plan to raise the benchmark interest rate.

    is sensitive to the market and economic disruptions that his trade policies can
    generate. That sensitivity may suggest that there are limits on how he will push
    those policies.”
