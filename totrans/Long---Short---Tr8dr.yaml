- en: I noticed that BIDU, one of the stronger stocks in the chinese market has outperformed
    FXI consistently both with upside and downside market moves. In other words, when
    the market is in a strong downward trend (as it is now), BIDU has gone down less
    than FXI. When the market was appreciating BIDU outperformed FXI.

    short FXI. Should yield return in an upward or downward trending market.'
