- en: The graphic below is a histogram that reflects the frequency distribution of
    daily returns in the S&P 500 index (SPX) since the March bottom. I have shaded
    in gray the column that represents gains which have fallen in the -1% to +1% range.
    These are relatively neutral days. The preponderance of green reflects the fact
    that in the past three months, the relatively few down days have tended to be
    small drops. On the other hand, positive days have includes more small gains in
    the 1-2% range, many more larger gains in the 3-4% range, and a couple of exceptionally
    large gains of 7.08% and 6.37%.
