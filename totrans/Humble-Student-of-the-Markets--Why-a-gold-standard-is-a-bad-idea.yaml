    The hard money crowd, for example, has called for the return of the gold standard.

    to an global downturn of unprecedented proportions and doom future generations
    to heightened economic volatility.

    in a bank. The bank would issue you a receipt and you could use that paper receipt
    for trade and commerce. The bank would lend out your deposit of gold to others.
    This was credit creation, which expanded the money supply. For every ducat lent
    out, that ducat would usually wind back up in the banking system, creating another
    ducat available to be lent out. Even with the imposition of reserve requirements
    that constraine the amount of loans they could make based on their deposit base,
    this form of fractional bank lending expanded credit and created enormous number
    of jobs and raised prosperity.

    a temptation to debase the currency. The current episode of paper money debasement
    began in earnest when Richard Nixon took the U.S. off the gold standard and the
    world went to a Dollar standard for monetary reserves. The trouble was, the U.S.
    Dollar wasn’t based on anything, other than the good name of the U.S. government.

    in debt. It is about to print money to try to climb out of its hole. This consensus
    has been supported by pretty much all of the central banks and governments around
    the world. Some analysts have argued that the imposition of a gold standard would
    create the discipline on the monetary authorities from debasing the currency in
    this manner.

    gold at a fixed rate. Anyone could turn in their Dollars, euros, Yens, Pound Sterling
    and so on, to the appropriate central bank and get gold at a fixed gold price.
    Such a monetary regime also implies a fixed exchange rate arrangement like Bretton
    Woods. Instead of allowing the market to determine currency prices, the world
    would return to fixed exchange rates and periodic exchange rate revaluations.
    Is that really the regime that we want to return to?

    is based on the elegant formula MV = PQ. Holding V (monetary velocity) constant,
    changes in money supply directly changes the GDP level. Under a gold standard,
    money supply is restricted by the supply of gold, based on world mine output.

    redeem their paper currency for gold, the money supply would collapse and the
