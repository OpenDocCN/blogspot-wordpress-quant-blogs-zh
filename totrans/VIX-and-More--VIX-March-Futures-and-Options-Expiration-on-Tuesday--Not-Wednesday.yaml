    and [options](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20options) expiration
    for March falls on *next Tuesday*, March 18^(th), not the typical Wednesday. This
    means that the VIX special opening quotation ([SOQ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20SOQ))
    used to determine the March settlement price will be at the open on Tuesday and
    also the last trading day for the VIX March futures and options will be on Monday.
    With the speed at which things are developing in Ukraine and elsewhere, these
    24 hours could turn out to be significant.

    the CBOE maintains a 2014 options expiration calendar [here](http://www.cboe.com/TradTool/2014_CBOEwebsite.pdf),
    with the VIX expiration highlighted in a solid dark orange box. Note that I have
    a link to the CBOE options expiration calendar on the blog at the bottom of my
    VIX, Sentiment & Options section.

- en: To review how the VIX expiration dates are determined, the VIX futures and options
    expire 30 days before the SPX monthly options expiration in the following month.
    These SPX options expirations are almost always on a Friday, therefore the VIX
    expiration is almost always on the Wednesday four weeks and two days prior to
    the SPX expiration. The complication factor for the VIX March 2014 expiration
    cycle is that on Friday, April 18, the CBOE is closed due to the Good Friday holiday,
    which pushes up the April SPX expiration to Thursday, April 17, with the result
    that the VIX March expiration is pushed up one day as well.

    explain some of its unique characteristics, but it is worth noting that the VIX
    SOQ is not the price at which the VIX opens, but rather another separate calculation
    that takes place at the open.
