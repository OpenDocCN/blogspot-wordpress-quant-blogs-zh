- en: '*“This is just a simple one year chart of the VIX in a price channel with MACD
    and stochastic indicators. Every time the VIX has broken the price channel lower
    line (highlighted) there has been a reversal, even in this lengthy downtrend.
    In addition, I have white arrows pointing from where the stochastic lines were
    crossing. This either coincided with the channel break or was slightly before
    or after. I also red boxed the most recent MACD bars, which are getting shorter.
    [Finally,] the distance between the last price line break and the most recent
    shows the most X-axis (vertical) distance [of] any other consecutive price line
    breaks throughout the year.”*'
