This

[piece](http://www.kc.frb.org/publicat/sympos/2008/Gorton.08.04.08.pdf)

by Gary Gorton, published around August 2008, is great. Interestingly, he argues that the creation of the ABX.HE index (subprime credit default swap index) helped burst the bubble quicker. Others (

[Ingo Fender and Peter Hördahl](http://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt0806u.htm)

at the BIS) have argued it has exagerated the credit decline in that sector.

Also interesting, Gorton advised AIG for the past 10 years, I hear.
