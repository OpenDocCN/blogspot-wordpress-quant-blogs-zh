    You see, evolution happens at many levels, such as the gene level as when the
    sickle cell gene grows in malarial environments. The mere gene view is the 'selfish
    gene' process introduced in contrast to naive group selectionism, which in the
    1960s was based on the idea that 'what is good for the group is good for the individual'.
    However, Richard Dawkins was far too dismissive of non gene-centered selection,
    as it is now recognized that organizations higher than the gene—the organism,
    the tribe, the species—sometimes compete evolutionarily, as when grey squirrels

    certain groups (notably, the Jews) are parasites, and Wilson notes that ecologically
    you can group people into two groups: predators and parasites. A predator takes
    advantage of the smaller population, a parasite takes advantage of a larger population,
    but, they do the same thing. Thus, it isn''t any different to assert some group
    is acting parasitic any more than it is to assert some group is acting predatory.
    If all groups are selfish acting in their own interest just has a different name
    depending on its numbers.'

    to justify anti-Semitism. However, I think it's reasonable to look at human groups
    historically and call various strategies as parasitic or predatory. Indeed, given
    the zeitgeist strongly discourages allegations of parasitism because this is considered
    piling on minority groups, discouraging diversity, etc., it is probable that parasitic
    behavior is more common, because it doesn't have to withstand criticisms of parasitism
    the way majority groups have to withstand the negative PR of predation. For example,
    note that Noam Chomsky basically defines evil as bad behavior combined with total
    power, thus making the US the monster of the twentieth century as a consequence
    of the size of its economy (and, in his mind, the relative virtue of the weak
    Palestinians vs. the stronger Israelis). It's reasonable to assume majority groups
    will have more problems exploiting minority groups (predation) than minority groups
    will have exploiting majority groups (parasitism).
