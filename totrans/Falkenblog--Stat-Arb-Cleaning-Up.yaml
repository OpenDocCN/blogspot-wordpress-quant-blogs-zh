- en: Lots of independent corroboration that stat arb is making a lot of money in
    this tumult. Stat arb is basically trading based on the theme that stocks mean-revert
    over short horizons, and is based on statistical patterns. When applied to hundreds
    of stocks simultaneously, it has very low volatility. DE Shaw, Morgan Stanley,
    and Renaissance, are big players.

    in hedge funds saying, 'thanks!' Note the lack of any large hedge fund blowing
    up in this mess.
