- en: Are the US Federal Reserve and Treasury at fault for the imbalances caused by
    the US Dollar reserve system?  The answer is probably the same as your answer
    to “Is the alcoholic to blame or the person that knowingly gives the alcoholic
    a drink more at fault?” or “Is the subprime borrower to blame or the bank that
    lends money to the subprime borrower more at fault?” I do not think Bernanke and
    Geithner can bear the burden of imbalances stemming from a US dollar reserve system
    that has evolved over the last 15 years; however, through improper exploitation
    of the imbalanced system, they certainly might be very responsible for its demise.

    joining in the world’s buying efforts.  The world has engaged quantitative easing
    since March 1999.  If they pursue it for their benefit, then why can’t we?
