    bullish. First, there is widespread acceptance that the U.S. is in recession.
    Moreover, fears of a repeat of the Great Depression seem to have peaked and are
    subsiding. As the chart below shows, a

    that the stock market will not put in a convincing bottom until there are widespread
    calls for a double-dip recession. Well, we are now seeing the first call from
    Niall Ferguson in a FT article entitled [An imaginary retrospective of 2009](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/1be84cc4-cc0d-11dd-9c43-000077b07658.html):'

    nightmare of the 1990s by yen appreciation and a collapse of consumer confidence.
    Things were little better in Europe. There had been much anti-American finger-pointing
    by European leaders in 2008\. The French president Nicolas Sarkozy had talked
    at the G-20 summit in Washington as if he alone could save the world economy.
    The British prime minister Gordon Brown had sought to give a similar impression,
    claiming authorship of the policy of bank recapitalisation. The German chancellor
    Angela Merkel, meanwhile, voiced stern disapproval of the excessively large American
    deficit.

    article, a rose by any other name smells just as desperate and despondent.
