  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    how consistently strong contango has been this year (which is why 2012 shows as
    such an outlier in [V and M’s chart](http://vixandmore.blogspot.tw/2012/10/the-2012-vix-futures-term-structure-as.html)).

    is short-term bullish, but longer term cautious.

- en: A case in point is what happened with Caterpillar (CAT) yesterday. CAT is an
    important bellwether of the global capital equipment sector as it operates all
    over the world. The company reported earnings before the opening bell yesterday.
    It beat earnings estimates, but missed on sales estimates and lowered its forecast
    for 2012\. Here is the statement [emphasis added]

- en: We now expect 2012 sales and revenues to be about $66 billion and profit in
    a range of $9.00 to $9.25 per share. The previous outlook for sales and revenues
    was a range of $68 to $70 billion with profit of about $9.60 per share at the
    middle of the sales and revenues outlook range.

    that are weaker than we had previously expected.*** In addition, Cat dealers have
    lowered order rates well below end-user demand to reduce their inventories. Production
    across much of the company has been lowered, resulting in temporary shutdowns
    and layoffs. Lower production will continue until inventories and dealer order
    rates move back in line with dealer deliveries to end users. The reduction in
    the profit outlook is in line with the lower sales and revenues outlook, partially
    offset by the gain on the sale of a majority interest in our third party logistics
    business.'

    2013 with modest improvement in the United States, China and most of the developing
    world, but continuing difficulty in Europe. Based on our economic forecast, our
    preliminary outlook for 2013 is for sales and revenues to be about the same as
    2012 in a range of up 5 percent to down 5 percent.

    and we''re not predicting a global recession. ***At this point, we expect 2013
    sales will be similar overall to 2012, but with*** ***a slightly weaker first
    half and a slightly better second half.*** While machine deliveries to end users
    have continued to hold up, our sales will probably remain relatively weak early
    in 2013 as dealers are likely to continue reducing inventories. When expected
    dealer inventory reductions level off, and easing actions by central banks and
    governments around the world begin to improve economic growth, we expect our business
    will begin to improve. While there''s reason for optimism, and we''re not expecting
    a global recession in 2013, we are prepared and stand ready to take action no
    matter what happens to the global economy," Oberhelman added.'

    that the stock (and the stock market) would have sold off in the wake of these
    statements. Well, it did at the open, but CAT recovered to rally throughout the
    day and finished the day on a positive note.
