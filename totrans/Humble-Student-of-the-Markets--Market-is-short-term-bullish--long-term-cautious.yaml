    how consistently strong contango has been this year (which is why 2012 shows as
    such an outlier in [V and M’s chart](http://vixandmore.blogspot.tw/2012/10/the-2012-vix-futures-term-structure-as.html)).

    important bellwether of the global capital equipment sector as it operates all
    over the world. The company reported earnings before the opening bell yesterday.
    It beat earnings estimates, but missed on sales estimates and lowered its forecast
    for 2012\. Here is the statement [emphasis added]

    a range of $9.00 to $9.25 per share. The previous outlook for sales and revenues
    was a range of $68 to $70 billion with profit of about $9.60 per share at the
    middle of the sales and revenues outlook range.

    that are weaker than we had previously expected.*** In addition, Cat dealers have
    lowered order rates well below end-user demand to reduce their inventories. Production
    across much of the company has been lowered, resulting in temporary shutdowns
    and layoffs. Lower production will continue until inventories and dealer order
    rates move back in line with dealer deliveries to end users. The reduction in
    the profit outlook is in line with the lower sales and revenues outlook, partially
    offset by the gain on the sale of a majority interest in our third party logistics
    business.'

    2012 in a range of up 5 percent to down 5 percent.

    statements. Well, it did at the open, but CAT recovered to rally throughout the
    day and finished the day on a positive note.
