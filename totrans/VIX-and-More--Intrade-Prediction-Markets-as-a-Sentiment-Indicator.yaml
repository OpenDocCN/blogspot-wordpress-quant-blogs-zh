    brain from time to time.  At this [prediction market](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction_markets)
    site, users can buy and sell [binary options contracts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_option)
    that allow them to place bets on whether a future event will happen.  Intrade
    has a broad range of contracts that cover everything from whether Osama Bin Laden
    will be captured by a particular month, which country will host the 2016 Olympics,
    what the year’s snowfall will be in <city st="on">New York City,</city> and a
    wide variety of bets about the <country-region st="on"><place st="on">US</place></country-region>
    election.'

    for their purported ability to provide a better predictive view of the future
    than that of individual experts.  Evaluating the arguments on both sides of this
    issue is beyond today’s scope, but those who are interested in reading about these
    claims may wish to start with [Prediction Markets: Does Money Matter?](http://www.newsfutures.com/pdf/Does_money_matter.pdf)
    by Servan-Schreiber, Wolfers, Pennock and Galebach and move on to prediction markets
    as a proxy for probabilities in [Interpreting Prediction Market Prices as Probabilities](http://bpp.wharton.upenn.edu/jwolfers/Papers/InterpretingPredictionMarketPrices.pdf)
    by Wolfers and Zitzewitz.  For an excellent broad introduction to prediction markets,
    I recommend [Prediction Markets](http://bpp.wharton.upenn.edu/jwolfers/Papers/Predictionmarkets.pdf),

    prediction markets contracts are not as popular as those for politics and entertainment.  I
    do think, however, that there is considerable potential value not only in establishing
    probabilities for future events, but also gauging investor sentiment.  At the
    moment, the most heavily traded financial contract at Intrade is whether the <country-region
    st="on"><place st="on">US</place></country-region> will go into a recession in
    2008.  I have included a chart of that contract, which goes back to August 2007,
    in the graphic below, which compares estimates of the probability of a recession
    with the SPX during the same period.  While there is a very high negative correlation
    here (i.e., we have yet another contrarian sentiment indicator working), I find
    it particularly interesting that the expectations for a 2008 recession peaked
    just as the SPX was making its January bottom.

    there would be quite a few more gems to pluck from the prediction markets.  Until
    then, they are still a great place to get a sense of what the odds are that Barack
    Obama wins the Democratic nomination or Barry Bonds will be found guilty of one
    or more of the perjury and obstruction charges he is facing.
