- en: If hedge-fund managers are playing a zero-sum game, what is their social utility?"  I
    thought about this question a lot in the past, and I used to agree with many others
    that the social utility of hedge funds, or trading in general, is to provide liquidity
    to the markets. And a good economic case can be made that the more liquid a market
    is, the higher the utility it is to all participants. However, based on recent
    experience of flash crash and other unfortunate mishaps, we find out that traders
    typically do not provide liquidity when it is needed most! So this answer becomes
    quite unsatisfactory.  In trying to come up with a better reply, I though it is
    curious that few people asked "What is the purpose of having a Department of Defence?"
    since wars between nations are typically also zero-sum games, yet we greatly honour
    those who serve in the armed forces (in contrast to our feelings for hedge fund
    managers).  To me, clearly the answer with the best moral justification is that,
    in both cases, there is great social utility in defending either your clients'
    comfortable retirement from financial meltdown (e.g. due to governmental or corporate
    mismanagement), or in defending your country from foreign aggression. More specifically,
    the purpose of hedge funds is to reduce **long-term volatility** in your clients'
    net worth. (I would like to say "reduce *risks* to your clients' net worth", but
    that would be a bit too optimistic!)   I emphasize long-term volatility, because
    of course trading generates a lot of daily or hourly volatility in your clients'
    equity. But I do not believe that such short-term volatility affects ones' life
    goals. On the other hand, a 3-or-more-year drawdown in a typical buy-and-hold
    portfolio can wreck havoc with many lives.

    higher Sharpe ratio than a buy-and-hold portfolio (as indeed seems to be the case
    with the US equities markets these days), then yes, most hedge fund managers should
    just quit, instead of hogging intellectual resources from our best universities.
