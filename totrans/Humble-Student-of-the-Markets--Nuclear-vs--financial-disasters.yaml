- en: When designing a nuclear power plant, engineers follow a philosophy called “Defense
    of Depth”. That means that you first build everything to withstand the worst catastrophe
    you can imagine, and then design the plant in such a way that it can still handle
    one system failure (that you thought could never happen) after the other. A tsunami
    taking out all backup power in one swift strike is such a scenario. The last line
    of defense is putting everything into the third containment (see above), that
    will keep everything, whatever the mess, control rods in our out, core molten
    or not, inside the reactor.

    the nuclear power plant was built for (the Richter scale works logarithmically;
    the difference between the 8.2 that the plants were built for and the 8.9 that
    happened is 5 times, not 0.7). So the first hooray for Japanese engineering, everything
    held up.

    hardly a surprise. They have built much of their infrastructure with a major earthquake
    in mind. It is therefore a testament to their preparedness that a far more powerful
    earthquake (8.9) struck Japan and left it with a death toll in the tens of thousands
    (and much of that was from the tsunami and not the earthquake). By comparison,
