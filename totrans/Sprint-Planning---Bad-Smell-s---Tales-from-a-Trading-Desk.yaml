- en: Mountain Goat offers an [overview](http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/scrum/sprint-planning-meeting)
    of the aims of the sprint planning meeting.  Without wanting to re-iterate what
    Mountain Goat and others have already written, I’ll take a different slant, and
    provide a view on things that might go wrong when sprints are planned, and stories
    are estimated.

- en: “Sprint Goal” is probably the first item that is unfortunately sometimes glossed
    over in the “charge” to estimate the sprint backlog.  Unfortunately, without clear
    articulation of the goal, there is unfortunately “opportunity” for scope creep,
    which in itself is a [debated](http://www.scrumalliance.org/community/articles/2013/2013-may/is-scope-creep-anti-scrum)
    topic of scrum.  My view is that scope creep is always going to happen, but it
    need to be controlled so that a sprint delivers what it set out to deliver based
    on the sprint planning, as aligned by the sprint goal.  Effectively the spring
    goal could be though of as a constrain on the spring backlog.

- en: Anyway, getting back to spring goal.  Failure to provide a goal, is like failing
    to offer a light at the end of a tunnel.  My advice is to ensure the sprint goal
    is clear to all at the start, and end of the sprint planning session.

- en: Estimation.  Be very clear on the assumptions made when estimating stories. 
    Implicit assumption are often one of the reason for a delta in estimates between
    people when using planning poker cards.  Additionally, if grooming backlog activities
    occur (one hopes they do) , consider the correlation between game planning and
    backlog grooming
