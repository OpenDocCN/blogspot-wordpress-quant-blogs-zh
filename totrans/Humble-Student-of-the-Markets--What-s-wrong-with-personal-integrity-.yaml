    Such a structure makes the risk and return symmetric for investment bankers. If
    bankers want to do something stupid and foolish, then let them. However, I have
    found in the past that having virtually all of your net worth tied in a firm makes
    you think a lot more about risk control and how you make money.'

    Greater transparency would create more transparency and allow market participants
    to better price risk. While the likes of AIG could repeat its adventure in derivatives,
    but greater transparency could allow the market to restrain AIG’s actions through
    the risk pricing mechanism.'

    mechanism that created a system of weights and measures. It assures us that when
    we buy a pound of meat or a gallon of gasoline, that we get something that is
    indeed a pound or is a gallon.
