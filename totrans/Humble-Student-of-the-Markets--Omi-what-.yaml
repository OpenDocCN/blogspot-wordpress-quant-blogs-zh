    variant that was initially identified in South Africa and the Fed''s hawkish pivot.
    As evidence emerged that Omicron is more transmissible but less deadly, the market
    staged an enormous rip-your-face-off short-covering rally. Today, Pfizer and BioNTech
    reported that lab tests showed that a third dose of its vaccine protected against
    the Omnicron variant. A two-dose regime was less effective but still prevents
    severe illness. Here we are, the S&P 500 is within 1% of its all-time high again.'
