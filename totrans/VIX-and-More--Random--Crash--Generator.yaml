    mention of [Ian Woodward](http://www.highgrowthstock.com/IanBlog/)’s comments
    on the [Hindenburg Omen](http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=%7BDA451070-3B84-4BCE-ADAD-11B3D26FDE87%7D&siteid=mktw&dist=),

    Omen, my first thought was that surely the Anti-Spam Omen must be a signal worth
    heeding.
