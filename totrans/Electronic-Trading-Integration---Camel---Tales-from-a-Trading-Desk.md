## Electronic Trading Integration ‚Äì¬†Camel

I recently ordered this [book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Apache-Camel-Developers-Cookbook-Cranton/dp/1782170308) on Apache Camel as this Fuse [example](https://github.com/FuseByExample/websocket-activemq-camel) on GitHub around websockets and ActiveMQ got me thinking about why there isn‚Äôt often tech stack discussions that include Apache [Camel](http://camel.apache.org/).¬† Further, as pointed to by a colleague, the old world of Apache Tomcat as a container being replaced by the likes of Apache [ServiceMix](http://servicemix.apache.org/) or [Fabric8](http://fabric8.io/#/welcome) ‚Äì nice to see their is a [docker](https://github.com/fabric8io/fabric8-docker#try-it-out) for Fabric8 üòâ¬† The age old issue of partitioning the code based may also benefit from bundles/features via [Karaf](http://karaf.apache.org/manual/latest-2.3.x/users-guide/provisioning.html) ‚Äì [iPaaS](https://github.com/fabric8io/fabric8).

Sample cookbook Camel code [here](https://github.com/CamelCookbook/camel-cookbook-examples).
