- en: Scott Rosenberg “Can an Arcane Crypto Ledger Replace Uber, Spotify and AirBnB?”
    recent [article](https://medium.com/backchannel/can-an-arcane-crypto-ledger-replace-uber-spotify-and-airbnb-f8ce3846d84a#.ir53lcvhj)
    is worth a read in my view.  Specifically around the “d-word phrases”: Distributed
    Autonomous Corporation (DAC), Distributed Autonomous Organization (DAO), Distributed
    Cooperative Organization (DCO), etc.  La’Zooz  is most interesting, and something
    to watch, likewise Ujo.  In many ways the article paint a possible future picture,
    which from a software engineering perspective is most interesting to say the least.

    on blockchain – blockchain is the new silver bullet.

    at Open [Bazaar](http://bravenewcoin.com/news/sneak-peek-at-bitcoins-upcoming-killer-app-open-bazaar/) –
    the much speculated killer blockchain application.
