    had a 15% loss in income, and live in their mortgaged property. As part of a $1B
    national program, 1500 lucky Minnesotans will receive a $50k no-interest loan
    after filling out a bunch of paperwork, and they don't have to pay it back at
    all if they then live in that home for 5 years.

    have had a decline in income given this carrot? In lending, ability and willingness
    to pay are key variables, and it seems government is doing everything it can to
    make people believe those who pay are suckers. As traditional lending then dries
    up, leaving only FHA lending, the housing market remains depressed. Further, most
    people who don't pay will just make it harder for them to get loans in the future
    and won't receive the windfall, as it is decided via a lottery.

    of work where their services are needed, that will pay them what they think is
    their best wage. These programs simply slow this process down, as people hold
    out for the latest government give-away that encourages having lower income. Further,
    most people won't receive aid, so luring them into this complacency just makes
    them less motivated and ultimately poorer.
