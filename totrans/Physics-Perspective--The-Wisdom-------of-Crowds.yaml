    estimations of value has a very long history. It's certainly at the root of the
    infamous Efficient Markets Hypothesis, which claims that markets gather and process
    information so efficiently that price movements have no predictable patterns and
    prices of financial instruments always reflect something very close to the true
    fundamental value of the assets in question. More recently, The Wisdom of Crowds
    has been the driving force behind prediction markets. One one way or another,
    this notion lurks behind the slippery and insidious idea that "markets know best"
    and that pretty much everything from water distribution to higher education should
    be organized as a market.

    at the outset to acknowledge that the idea only works in some rather special situations
    (not that readers paid much attention). A crowd estimating the number of marbles
    in a jar or the correct price of a stock will only get superior results -- superior
    in accuracy to the guess of any one individual, and even of experts -- if the
    people are on average unbiased in their estimates; it won't work if they tend
    systematically to estimate too high or low. Moreover, the people have to make
    their estimates independently of one another. Any kind of social influence, one
    person copying or even being slightly swayed by the actions of another, also spoils
    the result. Wise crowds very quickly become dumb herds.

    been done to probe in detail around the boundaries where wise crowds become unwise,
    how it happens and which are the key effects. This has been rectified by an impressive
    set of experiments carried out by Jan Lorenz and colleagues from ETH-Zurich, and

    estimation experiments in a range of conditions. They gave the participants monetary
    incentives to estimate accurately, and chose questions (on things like geography
    and crime statistics) for which the true answers are known. Then, in some trials,
    participants made their estimates on their own, without having any idea about
    the estimations of others, and in other trials, they were either informed in complete
    detail of what others had estimated or given at least average information on the
    others' estimates. The idea was to compare how well the crowd made estimates in
    the absence and presence of social influence.

    of crowds effect, and does so in three specific ways. It''s interesting to consider
    these in some detail to see just how this whole "wise crowd" illusion falls apart
    in the face of a little social influence:'

    of listening to the judgements of others led to a marked decrease in the diversity
    of the participants estimates. That is, the estimates of the various people become
    more like one another -- people adjust their views to fit more closely with others
    -- but this does very little to improve the collective accuracy of the crowd.
    In effect, people think they are sharing information, but little information actually
    gets shared. The figure below illustrates what happens: in successive trials,
    a measure of the group''s opinion diversity decreases dramatically if people hear
    either full or average information on the estimates of others, meanwhile the collective
    error decreases only marginally.'

    “range reduction effect.” Imagine that a government tries to use the wisdom of
    crowds, assembling a group and surveying their opinions, hoping to get a range
    of views and some idea of how much consensus there is on some topic. You would
    hope that, if the crowd's estimate was NOT accurate, this lack of accuracy would
    be reflected in a wide range of estimates from the individuals -- the wide range
    would signal a lack unanimity and confidence. A truly bad outcome would be a crowd
    that at once gives a very inaccurate estimate and does so with a narrow range
    of opinion differences, signalling apparent strong certainty in the result. But
    this is precisely what the research found -- in the social influence conditions,
    the individuals' estimates didn't "bracket" the true answer, with some being higher
    and others lower. Rather, the group narrowed the range of their views so strongly
    that the truth tended to reside outside of the group's range -- they were both
    inaccurate and apparently confident at the same time.

    the participants in the different conditions, asking them how confident they were
    in the accuracy of the group's final consensus estimate. Social influence, while
    it didn't make the crowd's estimate any more accurate, did fill the participants
    with strong confidence and belief in improved accuracy. Think 2005, housing bubble,
    mortgages with no income and no assets, etc. As hard as it is to imagine that
    people could have believed the market could not fail to go up further, most did.
    And they did in large part because they saw others apparently believing the same
    thing.

    their wisdom. Social influence is hard to eradicate. Even in markets, supposedly
    driven by anonymous individuals making their own estimates, lots of people are
    reading the newspapers and news feeds and listening to analysts, and, even when
    not, looking to price movements and using them to infer whether someone else may
    know something they don't. In these experiments, social influence makes everyone
    think and do much the same thing, makes it likely that the consensus view aims
    well wide of the actual truth, and, perversely, makes everyone involved increasingly
    confident that the group knows what it's doing. Some kind of Wisdom.
