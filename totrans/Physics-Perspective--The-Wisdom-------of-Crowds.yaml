- en: The notion that markets aggregate the opinions of many and thereby make superior
    estimations of value has a very long history. It's certainly at the root of the
    infamous Efficient Markets Hypothesis, which claims that markets gather and process
    information so efficiently that price movements have no predictable patterns and
    prices of financial instruments always reflect something very close to the true
    fundamental value of the assets in question. More recently, The Wisdom of Crowds
    has been the driving force behind prediction markets. One one way or another,
    this notion lurks behind the slippery and insidious idea that "markets know best"
    and that pretty much everything from water distribution to higher education should
    be organized as a market.

  zh: 市场汇聚许多观点，从而作出更优的价值评估这一观念有着非常悠久的历史。它无疑是臭名昭著的效率市场假说的根源，该假说声称市场如此高效地收集和处理信息，价格波动没有可预测的模式，金融工具的价格总是反映所涉及资产的真实基本价值非常接近的东西。最近，群体智慧一直是预测市场背后的推动力。在这样或那样的方式中，这一观念隐藏在滑稽且阴险的想法背后，即“市场最懂”并且几乎所有从水资源分配到高等教育的事情都应该按照市场方式组织。
- en: But in his bestselling book on the topic, James Surowiecki was somewhat careful
    at the outset to acknowledge that the idea only works in some rather special situations
    (not that readers paid much attention). A crowd estimating the number of marbles
    in a jar or the correct price of a stock will only get superior results -- superior
    in accuracy to the guess of any one individual, and even of experts -- if the
    people are on average unbiased in their estimates; it won't work if they tend
    systematically to estimate too high or low. Moreover, the people have to make
    their estimates independently of one another. Any kind of social influence, one
    person copying or even being slightly swayed by the actions of another, also spoils
    the result. Wise crowds very quickly become dumb herds.

  zh: 但在詹姆斯·索罗维基关于这一主题的最佳畅销书中，他在一开始就相当谨慎地承认，这一想法只在一些相当特殊的情况下才有效（读者并没有太关注）。一个群体估计罐子里的弹珠数量或股票的正确价格，只有当人们平均而言在他们的估计上没有偏见时，他们才会得到更优的结果——在准确性上优于任何一个人的猜测，甚至优于专家；如果他们倾向于系统性地估计过高或过低，那么这种方法将不起作用。此外，人们必须独立地做出他们的估计。任何一种社会影响，一个人复制或甚至稍微受到另一个人的行为的影响，也会破坏结果。智慧群体很快就会变成愚蠢的羊群。

    been done to probe in detail around the boundaries where wise crowds become unwise,
    how it happens and which are the key effects. This has been rectified by an impressive

    estimation experiments in a range of conditions. They gave the participants monetary
    incentives to estimate accurately, and chose questions (on things like geography
    and crime statistics) for which the true answers are known. Then, in some trials,
    participants made their estimates on their own, without having any idea about
    the estimations of others, and in other trials, they were either informed in complete
    detail of what others had estimated or given at least average information on the
    others' estimates. The idea was to compare how well the crowd made estimates in
    the absence and presence of social influence.

  zh: 结果显示，社会影响完全破坏了群体智慧效应，而且是以三种具体方式做到的。详细考虑这些方式很有趣，可以清楚地看到这种整个“智慧群体”的幻觉在轻微的社会影响面前是如何崩溃的：
- en: '1\. In what the researchers call the “social influence effect,” the mere act
    of listening to the judgements of others led to a marked decrease in the diversity
    of the participants estimates. That is, the estimates of the various people become
    more like one another -- people adjust their views to fit more closely with others
    -- but this does very little to improve the collective accuracy of the crowd.
    In effect, people think they are sharing information, but little information actually
    gets shared. The figure below illustrates what happens: in successive trials,
    a measure of the group''s opinion diversity decreases dramatically if people hear
    either full or average information on the estimates of others, meanwhile the collective
    error decreases only marginally.'

  zh: 1. 研究人员称这种现象为“社会影响效应”：仅仅是通过听取他人的判断，参与者的估计多样性就显著降低。也就是说，不同人的估计变得更加相似——人们调整自己的观点以更紧密地与他人一致——但这并没有多少助于提高群体的整体准确性。实际上，人们以为自己在分享信息，但实际分享的信息非常有限。下面的图表说明了会发生什么：在连续试验中，如果人们听到其他人估计的完整或平均信息，群体的观点多样性会急剧下降，而集体误差仅略有减少。

- en: 2\. A second and even more interesting effect is what the researchers call the
    “range reduction effect.” Imagine that a government tries to use the wisdom of
    crowds, assembling a group and surveying their opinions, hoping to get a range
    of views and some idea of how much consensus there is on some topic. You would
    hope that, if the crowd's estimate was NOT accurate, this lack of accuracy would
    be reflected in a wide range of estimates from the individuals -- the wide range
    would signal a lack unanimity and confidence. A truly bad outcome would be a crowd
    that at once gives a very inaccurate estimate and does so with a narrow range
    of opinion differences, signalling apparent strong certainty in the result. But
    this is precisely what the research found -- in the social influence conditions,
    the individuals' estimates didn't "bracket" the true answer, with some being higher
    and others lower. Rather, the group narrowed the range of their views so strongly
    that the truth tended to reside outside of the group's range -- they were both
    inaccurate and apparently confident at the same time.

  zh: 2. 第二个，甚至更有趣的现象，研究人员称之为“范围减少效应”。想象一下，一个政府试图利用群体智慧，召集一个小组并调查他们的观点，希望得到一系列观点以及某些话题上达成共识的程度。你希望的是，如果群体的估计不准确，这种不准确性会反映在个体之间的一系列估计中——这个宽广的范围会显示出缺乏一致性和信心。一个真正糟糕的结果是一群人同时给出了非常不准确的估计，并且意见差异的范围非常狭窄，显示出对结果的明显强烈信心。但研究正是发现了这一点——在社会影响条件下，个体的估计并没有“框定”真实答案，一些人估计高于真实值，另一些则低于真实值。相反，群体强烈地缩小了他们的观点范围，以至于真实答案往往位于群体范围之外——他们同时既不准确又显然自信。
- en: 3\. Finally, and worse still, is the “confidence effect”. The researchers interviewed
    the participants in the different conditions, asking them how confident they were
    in the accuracy of the group's final consensus estimate. Social influence, while
    it didn't make the crowd's estimate any more accurate, did fill the participants
    with strong confidence and belief in improved accuracy. Think 2005, housing bubble,
    mortgages with no income and no assets, etc. As hard as it is to imagine that
    people could have believed the market could not fail to go up further, most did.
    And they did in large part because they saw others apparently believing the same
    thing.

  zh: 3. 最后，更糟糕的是所谓的“自信效应”。研究人员在不同条件下采访了参与者，询问他们对自己的小组最终共识估计的准确性有多自信。社会影响虽然没有使群体的估计更加准确，却让参与者充满了强烈的自信和对更准确性的信念。想想2005年的情况，房地产泡沫，没有收入和资产的按揭贷款等。尽管很难想象人们会相信市场不可能进一步上涨，但大多数人确实是这样想的。在很大程度上，他们之所以这样想，是因为他们看到其他人似乎也相信同样的事情。
- en: Altogether, this careful study points more toward the idiocy of crowds than
    their wisdom. Social influence is hard to eradicate. Even in markets, supposedly
    driven by anonymous individuals making their own estimates, lots of people are
    reading the newspapers and news feeds and listening to analysts, and, even when
    not, looking to price movements and using them to infer whether someone else may
    know something they don't. In these experiments, social influence makes everyone
    think and do much the same thing, makes it likely that the consensus view aims
    well wide of the actual truth, and, perversely, makes everyone involved increasingly
    confident that the group knows what it's doing. Some kind of Wisdom.

  zh: 总的来说，这项精心设计的研究更多地指向了群体的愚蠢，而非他们的智慧。社会影响难以根除。即使在由匿名个体做出自己估计驱动的市场中，也有很多人在阅读报纸和新闻提要，听分析师的分析，即使不是这样，也会观察价格变动，并据此推断是否有人知道他们不知道的事情。在这些实验中，社会影响让每个人都思考和做几乎相同的事情，使得共识观点很可能远离实际的真相，而且，讽刺的是，使得所有参与者都越来越自信于群体知道自己在做什么。某种程度上看，这算是一种智慧。
