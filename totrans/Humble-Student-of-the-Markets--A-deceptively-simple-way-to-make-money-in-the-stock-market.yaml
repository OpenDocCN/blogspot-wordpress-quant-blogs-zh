    the process usually works for a while and then fails. It works for a while, because
    companies look best immediately after they receive a dollop of cash, whether via
    debt or equity. Things may not look so good after the cash is used, and expectations
    give way to reality.

    P/Es are historically high. Investors are likely to be willing to pay more for
    stocks if they perceive that the economic expansion could last, let’s say, another
    four years rather than another two years. The more time we have before the next
    recession, the more time that earnings can grow to justify currently high valuations.

    On the other hand, stock prices represent a leading indicator.
