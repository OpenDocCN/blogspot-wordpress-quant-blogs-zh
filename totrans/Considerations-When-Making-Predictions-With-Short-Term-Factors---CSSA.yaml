- en: Our thoughts on time-frame integration are often helplessly binary, while prediction
    error rates are anything but. Most people think in terms of rules without understanding
    the “why” or specifically what they are trying to accomplish. A common example
    was reflected in the previous posts done by Enn showing the performance of a short-term
    indicator as moderated by a moving average rule. The real gem in those posts which
    many readers may have caught is that the longer you hold a trade in the direction
    of the trend whether you started out short or long and have the distribution dicates
    that eventually you will end up with a positive expectation. The more subtle implication
    is that ***if you use a short-term indicator to predict next day returns and you
    are wrong, you face a major penalty that increases with time while you wait for
    the signal to revert.***

  zh: 我们对时间框架整合的想法往往是无助的二元化，而预测误差率则不然。大多数人以规则的形式思考，但不了解“为什么”，或者明确地说他们试图实现什么。一个常见的例子反映在之前由恩恩完成的帖子中，显示了短期指标的表现，作为一个移动平均规则的调节。在那些帖子中很多读者可能已经注意到的真正的宝石是，您持有交易的时间越长，无论您最初是空头还是多头，并且分布情况表明最终您都将获得积极预期。更微妙的含义是，***如果您使用短期指标预测第二天的收益，而您错了，您将面临一个随时间增加的主要惩罚，而您等待信号恢复。***
- en: 'Effectively the decision to use a short-term indicator to forecast direction
    carries different penalties depending on other time frames. Thus, there is effectively
    a tradeoff we must consider: ***what is our marginal accuracy in being able to
    predict up versus down days in different situations, and also what our marginal
    average daily return benefit to doing so.*** In effect, what is most important
    is the return and winning percentage spread between up and down days as conditional
    upon different situations. Thus it is not important per se in an absolute sense
    whether and up or down day has a high expected return and winning percentage,
    but rather the conditional effect that a given variable has in being able to separate
    the two. Going one step further, we would also test any variable’s effect on up
    or down day performance in relation to up or down day performance in isolation.
    Thus assuming we wanted to test a variable’s effect on daily follow-through, ***it
    would have to pass the null hypothesis test that the variable does not moderate
    daily follow-through in a statistically significant way***. This prevents us from
    considering more specific conditions or situations that take away from our statistical
    power and therefore add a high degree of noise. This type of offense is highly
    prevalent in trading system design–multiple rules are taken in sequence on the
    basis of viewing an increase in performance without knowing the marginal impact
    in statistical power versus a simpler version.'

  zh: 使用短期指标预测方向的决定在不同时间框架下会有不同的惩罚。因此，我们必须考虑一个有效的权衡：***在不同情况下，我们在预测上涨或下跌天数方面的边际准确性是多少，以及我们做到这一点的边际平均每日回报好处是多少。***
    实际上，最重要的是在不同情况下上涨和下跌天数之间的回报和获胜百分比差异。因此，绝对意义上，上涨还是下跌天有高预期回报和获胜百分比并不重要，而重要的是给定变量在能够区分这两者方面的条件效应。更进一步，我们还将测试任何变量对独立上涨或下跌天表现的影响。因此，假设我们想要测试一个变量对每日后续走势的影响，***那么它必须通过零假设检验，即该变量不会以统计显著方式调节每日后续走势***。这样做可以防止我们考虑更多特定条件或情况，这些情况会降低我们的统计功率，从而增加大量噪音。这种进攻方式在交易系统设计中非常普遍——基于观察到性能增加而依次采取多条规则，而不知道与简化版本相比，在统计功率方面的边际影响。
- en: Getting back to the subject at hand, there is a quick way to investigate whether
    it is worthwhile using reverse follow-through as a means of market prediction
    in different situations. Because this is a “thought” article, I have not gone
    to the time/trouble of running statistical tests–however, one simple method you
    can employ in this situation is to look at the spread between the winning percentage
    and the average daily return in different environments as defined by a given variable.
    Below is a table that shows the ***next day spread*** depending on whether the
    50 day moving average is above the 200 day moving average on the SPY. As you can
    clearly see the spread in both winning percentage and average daily returns is
    much lower when the 50 day moving average is above the 200 day moving average.
    In fact, at an absolute level, returns are positive and w% is also fairly high
    following up days when the trend is up. Since the spread appears statistically
    insignificant, this  begs the obvious question as to why you would want to bother
    including reverse follow through as a factor in a prediction model at all in this
    environment. Not only is the next day spread seemingly irrelevant, but as we mentioned
    before–the penalty is severe and increases as a function of time. Thus we face
    the prospect of compounding errors in such a situation. This does not per se imply
    that you should not use a reverse follow through model, but rather that you should
    significantly reduce your bet size or model contribution  stemming from this factor
    in a continuous manner.

  zh: 回到手头的主题，有一种快速的方法可以调查在不同情况下使用逆向跟随作为市场预测手段是否值得。因为这是一篇“思考”文章，我没有花时间/精力进行统计测试 -
    然而，你可以在这种情况下采用的一个简单方法是查看由给定变量定义的不同环境中的获胜百分比和平均日回报之间的差异。下面是一张表，显示了根据SPY的50日移动平均是否高于200日移动平均来确定的**下一日差**。正如你可以清楚地看到的，当50日移动平均高于200日移动平均时，无论是获胜百分比还是平均日回报的差异都要小得多。事实上，在绝对水平上，当趋势向上时，随着上涨天数的增加，回报是正的，获胜率也相当高。由于差距在统计上显然不显著，这引出了一个显而易见的问题，即在这种环境中，为什么你会想要在预测模型中包含逆向跟随因素。不仅下一日的差距似乎无关紧要，而且正如我们之前提到的
    - 惩罚是严重的，并且随时间的增加而增加。因此，我们面临在这种情况下错误不断累积的前景。这并不一定意味着你不应该使用逆向跟随模型，而是你应该以连续的方式显著减少你的赌注大小或模型贡献。
