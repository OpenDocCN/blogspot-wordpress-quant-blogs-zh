    he's very thoughtful. He's also swallowed the risk premium story so much, he's
    like a Keynesian who thinks the 1970's highlight the relevance of the Keynesian
    model.

    ratios was due to variation in expected cashﬂows. Now it seems all price-dividend
    variation corresponds to discount-rate variation. We thought that the cross-section
    of expected returns came from the CAPM. Now we have a zoo of new factors.

    be clever to earn high returns. Then came the CAPM. Every clever strategy to deliver
    high average returns ended up delivering high market betas as well. Then anomalies
    erupted, and there was chaos again. The “value eﬀect” was the most prominent anomaly.

    factors.

    if you don't mind circular explanations. We have, as Fama stated in 1991, given
    a fishing license for factors, where every exception to the standard model is
    now a potential factor. It's a bit like the
