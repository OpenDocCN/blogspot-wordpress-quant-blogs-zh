    Nassim called it. Whatever unexpected that happens you'll find that most of the
    experts didn't expected it--just as Taleb predicted. Space Shuttle? Berlin Wall?
    Britney's meltdown? Again, these thing were big events, and most experts didn't
    expect them, so Taleb did. Well, actually all he said was that unexpected things
    happen a lot. Is that a correct call? If you believe so, you are a Taleb fan.

- en: 'The article starts by noting that Taleb was lecturing to a group of Morgan
    Stanley risk managers, lambasting ''stress tests''. This is strange because one
    would think that, to a guy that hates the normal distribution, or really any parametric
    distribution, he would love the stress test. Stress tests can be anything you
    want: what happens to your portfolio if the S&P goes up 10% and the dollar falls
    10%? Improbable, perhaps, but these are nonparametric, their scope is only limited
    by your imagination. That he would say these are bad, leaves one to wonder, what,
    exactly, he thinks risk management should focus on. But that is not Taleb''s oeuvre,
    which is merely to criticize any forecasting tool because it is imperfect. The
    only positive advice he gives, is trivial, things like, go to cocktail parties,
    because you might hear a good idea in such a nontraditional environment; or that
    you should invest in wacky investments that have Powerball-type upside. Good luck
    with that.'

- en: Success is mainly marketing, and you have to hand it to Taleb, he's slyly presents
    himself as a prescient speculator, someone who makes money taking positions, without
    ever really saying so. For instance, it is remarked in the story he 'made' $35MM
    on eurodollar options on Oct 19, 1987 (the market crash). As a trader, that just
    means he didn't have his risk hedged, because remember, we was primarily a market
    maker then, a guy who makes money off customer flow, and so generally you don't
    want these guys taking sides, they make money off the bid-ask spread. And so the
    200 point move in Eurodollars that day (unprecedented) exposed him. That's simply
    a mistake, and others who didn't hedge their risk probably had the opposite pnl.
    But, elsewhere, if I remember, Taleb admits that his Oct 19th fortune was luck.
    Nevertheless, by putting out he 'made' $35MM, and that traders called him 'Nassim
    the dream', clearly it suggests he has the Midas touch. Subtle.

    from 2000 through 2004\. There was a joke when I was at one fund, where a bad
    idiosyncratic trade is always called a ''hedge'' after the fact. That is, the
    money you lost on that punt on volatility, or the oil bet you made that goes against
    you, you say was hedging something else in your portfolio. It''s a nice way to
    explain away a bad idea. So after the fund starting grinding out losses, Nassim
    started calling his fund a ''hedge'', not a fund, later, a ''laboratory''. Now
    he says about the fund:'

    in 2003 and 2004\. That averages out to around 12%, and as the risk free rate
    was about 4% over that period, and the volatility was probably around 17% on a
    monthly basis, thats a Sharpe of 0.47\. Not so good. And that's with his unaudited
    returns, so it's probably biased high (people have a tendency to round unaudited
    results upward significantly).

    the Black Swan, a fantastic plan. If you write a best selling book about investing,
    clearly some of those readers will be rich hedge fund investors. Now pitch them
    with the following story that is totally consistent with your revolutionary insights:
    I get 2 and 20 fees. Your returns will be near zero, until we catch a financial
    Black Swan, whose return cannot be quantified, but think Google or Harry Potter.
    Of course, ''absence of evidence'' is not ''evidence of absence'', so if nothing
    happens after 10 years, that proves nothing. Heck, even a lifetime of zero alpha
    proves nothing. Meanwhile, on $1B, that''s $20MM per year. Brilliant!'

  zh: 这个故事提到，他的前助手正在基于捕捉“黑天鹅”来启动基金，这是一个很棒的计划。如果你写一本畅销的投资书，显然其中一些读者将是富有的对冲基金投资者。现在向他们推销以下故事，这个故事与你的革命性见解完全一致：我收取2%的管理费和20%的绩效费。你的回报将接近于零，直到我们捕捉到一个金融“黑天鹅”，其回报无法量化，但可以想象为谷歌或哈利·波特。当然，“无证据”并不等同于“证据缺失”，所以如果10年过去后什么都没有发生，这并不能证明什么。哎呀，即使一生的α值为零也证明不了什么。与此同时，在10亿美元上，这就是每年2000万美元。太棒了！
