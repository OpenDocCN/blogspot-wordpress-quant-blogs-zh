- en: I am writing a prototype of an app that has multiple levels of grouping. I need
    to be able to double-click on the column header of a band, and have it do something
    to only the rows in that band. For instance, if the user double-clicks on the
    column that says 'Selected', then I want every checkbox in that group to be toggled
    without affecting the rows in any other group.

    the child rows that are associated with that header. The problem is that headers
    are not considered true rows within UltraWinGrid. They are "UI Elements". They
    do not have references to the rows that are directly beneath them.

    the way, the function 'ToggleSelected' is a good way of walking down the entire
    tree of rows in a grouped grid.)
