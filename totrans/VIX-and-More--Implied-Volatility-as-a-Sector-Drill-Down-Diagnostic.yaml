- en: I have said relatively little about the crisis in the financial sector largely
    because there are so many others out there who are covering this story in much
    more detail than I have any desire to get into.  Also, my trading is driven largely
    by technical analysis, charts and market sentiment, with fundamental analysis
    usually playing a prominent role only in my long-term holdings.

- en: That being said, this blog has an emphasis on volatility and risk, so this morning
    I pulled up some implied volatility charts in the financial sector and drilled
    down from general to specific to see to what extent implied volatility might indicate
    vis-à-vis the possibility of the tide turning in investor fear.  I have appended
    several of these charts below.  On the left hand side, they include the generic
    large cap financial sector index, [XLF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLF)
    ([components](http://funds.reuters.com/lipper/retail/reuters/portfolio.asp)),
    as well as the securities broker dealer index, [XBD](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XBD),
    whose volatility I [analyzed](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/08/watch-xbds-implied-volatility.html)
    back in August.  On the right side, I have the banks.  The BKX ([components](http://www.kbw.com/research/BKX.asp))
    is capitization-weighted and thus tilts toward money center banks; the KRX ([components](http://www.kbw.com/research/KRX.asp))
    has a strong regional and local focus; and the MFX ([components](http://www.kbw.com/research/MFX.asp)),
    as the name suggests, includes banks and other financial companies that are heavily
    involved in the mortgage finance business.  For comparison purposes, the BKX is
    down 18.7% on the year, the KRX is down 20.5% and the MFX is off 44.6%.

- en: From an IV perspective (and yes, many of these companies could use some intravenous
    fluids) I generally glance at XLF only as a generic overview of the financial
    sector.  The first finding of interest is that implied volatility in the XBD peaked
    in August and made a double top before Thanksgiving.  This is consistent with
    the widespread belief that [Goldman Sachs (GS)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=gs)
    has dodged the subprime bullet and other players in this sector have had sufficient
    time and corporate agility – if not perhaps the ideal risk management policies
    – to limit any additional damage.

    regional banks topped out at the end of November and is currently just below the
    August highs.  Still more concerning, if not more surprising, is the performance
    of the mortgage finance sector, where implied volatility is above the August peak
    and in the process of challenging the late November high water mark.  If I were
    a meteorologist looking at implied volatility, I would conclude that the storm
    has passed in the broker-dealer sector, but more thunderclouds are approaching
    in the regional banking and mortgage finance sectors.
