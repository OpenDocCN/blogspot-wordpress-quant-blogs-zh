    why 75 was our upside target coming into the year. Members of EagleBaySolutions
    receive updates on this research several times a month. First of all, the last
    major correction we saw in healthcare was during the September/October decline
    where most of the U.S. equities market took a hit. That correction has been a
    great reference point for a lot of sectors and averages, not just healthcare.
    But today, we’re focused on the $XLV. $75 and change was exactly the 261.8% Fibonacci
    extension of that decline. But in addition, it was also the 4 point measured move
    target based on the consolidation from December through February before the breakout:'

    T***he weight of the evidence suggests to me that a short entry could be here.***
    Our upside target in March was just over $75\. I don’t see any reason to be short
    if prices are above that level. This makes the risk/reward very much skewed in
    favor of the bears and the risk is well-defined. To me, that’s what matters most.'

    a good area to take profits on shorts. This is the level where we broke out from
    in late October before healthcare made it’s (potentially) final run. This area
    is also where several Fibonacci levels cluster together, particularly the 261.8%
    extension of the entire 2007-2009 correction and the 38.2% retracement of the
    2012-2015 rally. To me it’s where support/resistance levels and Fibonacci all
    come together. I would be covering shorts down there. This represents 14-18% lower
    from current prices.

    to hold a short position in the ETF may not be healthy for traders' bottom lines.
    Here's why.

    unclear whether the sell/short XLV call was successful because the market went
    down or if the sector went down. In his analysis, Parets showed a couple of charts
    showing slowing XLV momentum in the form of a downtrend in the RSI indicator,
    both on the daily and weekly chart. Here is the same chart for the SPX on a daily
    basis which also shows declining RSI and an index that has been rolling over.

    than the market, then we need to measure its relative performance. To his credit,
    Parets did show a XLV to SPY ratio chart, which filters out the market effect,
    indicating a relative trend violation and slowing momentum.

    components. The top panel depicts the XLV to SPY ratio, which did violate a short-term
    uptrend (red line). The market relative charts of Healthcare industries also show
    some short-term relative uptrend violations in Biotech and Pharmaceuticals. However,
    both the sector and its industry components remain in robust long-term relative
    uptrends (blue lines).

- en: To be sure, XLV was overbought and due for a pullback. Parets should take a
    bow for highlighting that observation in his analysis. However, the superior relative
    performance of the Healthcare sector has been very broad based across many industries
    and shorting into that kind of relative strength would indeed be a courageous
    act. Until the longer term relative uptrends of the sector and its industry components
    are violated, the jury is still very much out on the relative performance outlook
    for healthcare.

    short the sector here. The combination of a possible rally in the market, or even
    a recovery in the long-dated trend of positive relative performance, could really
    rip the face off any short seller.

    automatically accept conclusions of others (and that includes what I write). Market
    analysis should not be some magic black box with a "buy" or "sell" conclusion
