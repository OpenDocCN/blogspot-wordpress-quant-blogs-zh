    of each county would pay taxes on their properties. Nearly half of those tax revenues
    would then be spent by government officials to build and operate supermarkets.
    Each family would be assigned to a particular supermarket according to its home
    address. And each family would get its weekly allotment of groceries—"for free"—from
    its neighborhood public supermarket.

    Goldman Sachs. He or she can do more, bigger, and more profitable deals because
    of it. But Goldman Sachs itself is more powerful and more valuable to its clients
    because they have that person (and his or her network(s)) in place. To the question,
    "Who is more valuable, the banker or the platform?," the answer is always "Both."

- en: 'So discussions like [this one](http://news.efinancialcareers.co.uk/newsandviews_item/newsItemId-30422),
    where an individual who arranged a massively profitable trade for his bank expects
    far more compensation than the bank wants or is likely to give him, are an annual
    staple of my industry. Clearly the trader could not have done such a trade without
    the capital and resources of his employer, so a huge bonus is not merited. But
    the bank has incentives to make him happy, too, lest he leave with the special
    knowledge or relationships he employed or developed in that trade to replicate
    it—and the accompanying profits—at a competitor. Investment banker compensation
    is always comprised of some portion of reward for business won and profits made
    plus an option on potential future business and profits from that same banker.
    This insight helps explain the fact, puzzling to most outside the industry, that
    investment bankers can get paid tons of money even when they or their firms lose
    it: they are being paid for future potential results.'
