- en: I have committed to building an [htmlwidget](http://htmlwidgets.org) a week
    in 2015.  To isolate and separate the commitment from this blog, I set up a new
    site [Building Widgets](http://buildingwidgets.com) and Github [repo](http://github.com/timelyportfolio/buildingwidgets). 
    The first post [Can I Commit?](http://www.buildingwidgets.com/blog/2015/1/2/can-i-commit)
    provides meta introspection on commitment.

    of each year, we often become even more aware of this struggle in the form of
    [New Year's Resolutions](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/how-fast-youll-abandon-your-new-years-resolutions/). 
    This site is not really a New Year's Resolution.  It is more a resolution that
    coincidentally falls at the beginning of the year, since [htmlwidgets](http://htmlwidgets.org/)
    was released December 17\.

    of commitment failure will assert itself throughout the life of this project…

    htmlwidgets will only be application of the widgets, most likely for finance.
