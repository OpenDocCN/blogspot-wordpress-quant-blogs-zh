# Gateways | Coding the markets

## Gateways

### July 28, 2006

Like many other etrading development teams, we use ION’s [MarketView](http://iontrading.com/) for ECN connectivity. The possibility of coding our own gateways, or switching to a different gateway vendor is frequently mooted. Coding our own gateways would mean hiring more developers, but would give us more control. It’s hard to see what the advantage of switching to a different gateway vendor would be, unless they could offer dramatically better pricing or performance. Somehow I doubt that’s possible. But it would be very interesting to hear from anyone with experience of [iCubic](http://www.icubic.com), [Last Group](http://www.lastgroup.it) or [SoftSolutions](http://www.softsolutions.it/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=60&Itemid=65&lang=EN)‘ connectivity products.
