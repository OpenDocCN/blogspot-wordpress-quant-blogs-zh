    Exchanges: Market Microstructure for Practitioners"](http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Finance/?view=usa&ci=0195144708).
    It''s recommended by [Victor Niederhoffer](http://www.dailyspeculations.com/),
    and it''s every bit as impressive as I hoped. This is a canonical text to put
    up there with Hull. Unlike Hull, it''s not about pricing. Rather this is about
    the structure and mechanics of the industry: the markets, exchanges, ECNs, traders,
    brokers, dealers and instruments. I''m about 160 pages into this 600 page book,
    and I''ve already read wonderfully clear and concise explanations of…'

    how brokers handle clearing and settlement for their clients, how they provide
    access to exchanges and dealers, how they are often expert negotiators and know
    who's likely to trade, and how they can manage orders. There's also good coverage
    of commisions, soft dollars, dealer kickbacks for order flow, cash management,
    margin calls, securities lending, and notably the principal agent problem. That
    problem being that an agent's interests are never identical to their client's.
    When a broker is dishonest that can leave a client open to abuse. Harris details
    the following scams…

    and dealers. Now I really appreciate why we have compliance departments, and why
    there's so much emphasis in internal communications on upholding the firm's reputation
    and integrity. Once a broker gets a bad rep, they're finished !
