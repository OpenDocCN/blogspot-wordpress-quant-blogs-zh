# VIX and More: Expiring Monthly August 2010 Issue Recap

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/08/expiring-monthly-august-2010-issue.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/08/expiring-monthly-august-2010-issue.html#0001-01-01)

As last week was options expiration, this means the August issue of [*Expiring Monthly: The Option Traders Journal*](http://www.expiringmonthly.com/) was published yesterday and is available for subscribers to [download](http://www.expiringmonthly.com/members/).

This month’s feature section includes three articles on [weekly options](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/weeklys): a guest article from Vance Harwood of the [Six Figure Investing](http://sixfigureinvesting.com/blog/) blog; a punchy piece from [Adam Warner](http://www.dailyoptionsreport.com/) with the suspiciously familiar title, Weeklys & More Weeklys; and a Wolf Against the World segment in which Adam and [Mark Wolfinger](http://blog.mdwoptions.com/options_for_rookies/) debate the merits of weeklies.

I was particularly active for this issue, interviewing [Jay Kaeppel](http://www.amazon.com/Jay-Kaeppel/e/B001IQWLSO/ref=ntt_athr_dp_pel_1) on a wide variety of subjects from the VIX to futures to options; reviewing [The Complete Guide to Options Selling (2^(nd) edition)](http://www.amazon.com/Complete-Guide-Option-Selling-Second/dp/0071622373/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1282670491&sr=1-1), by James Cordier and Michael Gross; and launching the first in a series of articles on the [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures) [term structure](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/term%20structure) – a subject on which readers of this blog appear to have more questions than answers.

With six issues of the magazine to reflect on, I must say that the cumulative body of work has exceeded my very high expectations.

I have attached a copy of the Table of Contents for the August issue below for those who may be interested in learning more about the magazine. Subscription information and additional details about the magazine are available at [http://www.expiringmonthly.com/](http://www.expiringmonthly.com/).
