- en: ': As President Trump left the hospital and returned to the White House, the
    message from his doctors was he was doing fine, but he was not "out of the woods".
    Numerous outside physicians have made the point that COVID-19 is nothing like
    the flu. Flu symptoms hit the patient and eventually dissipate and go away. COVID-19
    patients often have ups and downs in their infection. They may feel fine, but
    symptoms flare, dissipate, and return. The process can last weeks, even months.
    Just because Trump reported feels fine now doesn''t mean that he won''t feel fine
    by this weekend.'

    患者的症状常常会有起伏。他们可能感觉良好，但症状会突然加剧，然后消散，再次出现。这一过程可能持续数周，甚至数月。特朗普现在报告感觉良好并不意味着他周末也会感觉良好。

  zh: 表明现在是大举进行财政刺激的时候了：
- en: The expansion is still far from complete. At this early stage, I would argue
    that the risks of policy intervention are still asymmetric. Too little support
    would lead to a weak recovery, creating unnecessary hardship for households and
    businesses. Over time, household insolvencies and business bankruptcies would
    rise, harming the productive capacity of the economy, and holding back wage growth.
    By contrast, the risks of overdoing it seem, for now, to be smaller. Even if policy
    actions ultimately prove to be greater than needed, they will not go to waste.
    The recovery will be stronger and move faster if monetary policy and fiscal policy
    continue to work side by side to provide support to the economy until it is clearly
    out of the woods.

  zh: 目前的扩张仍然远未完成。在这个早期阶段，我认为政策干预的风险仍然是不对称的。过少的支持将导致复苏乏力，给家庭和企业带来不必要的困难。随着时间的推移，家庭的破产和企业的破产将上升，损害经济的生产能力，并抑制工资增长。相比之下，过度干预的风险目前似乎较小。即使政策行动最终被证明超出需要，它们也不会被浪费。如果货币政策和财政政策继续并行作业，为经济提供支持，直到它明显走出困境，复苏将更加强劲、更快速。
