    not necessarily see gang buster growth, the risks of a hard landing are diminishing
    fast (see my previous posts

- en: The chart below of Chinese stocks (as represented by FXI) compared to the MSCI
    All-Country World Index (ACWI) shows that FXI rallied through a relative downtrend
    line in October, indicating that the worst is over for Chinese stocks. Moreover,
    FXI has retreated to test the downtrend line, which is now relative support, and
    this represents a good entry point for China bulls.

    and weak corporate governance, a better way to play a rebound in Chinese growth
    may be through the markets of China's regional trading partners. The chart below
    of MSCI Pacific Ex-Japan (EPP) relative to ACWI shows that EPP is in a more robust
    relative uptrend. There is a short dated relative uptrend (dotted line) that began
    in October, which is supported by a longer dated relative uptrend (solid line)
    that began in May when EPP bottomed on a relative basis.

    as EWA. A glance at top 10 stocks in EPP shows that nine of them are Australian,
    which indicates that the Aussie market has the heaviest influence in EPP.

    EWH vs. ACWI below shows that Hong Kong equities staged a relative breakout in
    late September and have been in a well=defined relative uptrend since. EWH does
    appear to be a tad overextended in the short-term, though.

    bottom panel of the above chart shows the correlation between EWA and EWH, which
    currently stands at 0.62\. While that is an elevated reading, keep in mind that
    is roughly the long-term correlation between stocks and bonds and therefore positions
    in those two ETFs should provide an adequate level of diversification while maintaining
    an exposure to the China bull story.
