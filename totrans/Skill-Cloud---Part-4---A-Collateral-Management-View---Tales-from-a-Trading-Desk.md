## Skill Cloud – Part 4 – A Collateral Management View

Given the last few postings on Skill Cloud, or more so, Team Cloud, its possible to consider the data modelling in terms of [collateral management](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateral_management) 😉 from an asset management perspective 😉

Lets dig into the collateral management view of team data modelling:

*   Agreements exist in the collateral management world that need to be satisfied.  This is many ways could be consider the same as projects within an organisation
*   Liquidity could be viewed as the people (resources) within an organisation.  Cash could be the star perfomers, with grading of asset quality attributed to skillset etc.  Liquidity being skillset
*   Bilateral agreements exist which impact the fungibility of resources (people).  Certain resources can’t be moved from projects because they offer possible certain skillsets, or domain knowledge
*   A margin call could be considered the generation of a hire request
*   Corporate actions would be a change in project scope, team etc

Clearly a bit of a [knapsack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem) problem
