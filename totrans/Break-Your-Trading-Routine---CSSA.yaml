- en: Routines are what define many of us as people. They can be defined as a group
    of habits and tasks that are often bounded by time intervals. Routines are the
    great stabilizers in life, and help us to preserve precious mental and physical resources.
    When times are tough, they allow us to coast on autopilot. They bring an element
    of certainty and regularity in an unstable world.

  zh: 习惯是我们作为人的一个重要特征。它们可以被定义为通常受时间间隔限制的一组习惯和任务。习惯是生活中的重要稳定器，帮助我们保护宝贵的精神和身体资源。当困难时，它们让我们能够自动驾驶。它们给一个不稳定的世界带来一种确定性和规律性。
- en: In my profession which entails building models and systems, routines are impossible–
    I am always forced to do new research or solve new problems. I am paid for approaching
    things in a novel way, sophisticated clientele don’t need me to find a boxed solution.
    Rather than operating 9-5, my hours can range from 8am-5am to accomodate overseas
    clients or tight deadlines– and it all revolves around what needs to be done.
    On the one hand, I wish my life involved more routine– I am always running in
    third gear and cannot risk slipping into cruise control (ie mediocrity). Its often
     difficult to plan to do ordinary activities. Many times to keep my edge,  I will
    simply take some time off to go for a walk–especially in the spring and summer–just
    to think about how to solve various issues.  Sometimes, I will go to a coffee
    shop without a book and a computer and just reflect on some ideas.

  zh: 在我的职业中，我需要建立模型和系统，习惯是不可能的——我总是被迫进行新的研究或解决新的问题。我是为了用新颖的方式处理事情而付费的，复杂的客户不需要我找到一个固定的解决方案。我的工作时间可以从早上8点到第二天早上5点不等，以适应海外客户或紧急的截止日期——一切都围绕着需要做的事情。一方面，我希望我的生活中涉及更多的常规——我总是在第三档运转，不能冒着降低到巡航状态（即平庸）的风险。计划做普通活动通常很困难。为了保持我的优势，我经常会简单地抽出一些时间散步——尤其是在春天和夏天——只是为了思考如何解决各种问题。有时，我会去咖啡店，不带书和电脑，只是思考一些想法。
- en: I notice that when I do not have the time to do these things, my creativity
    suffers and I am often approaching problems in a circular manner—like a dog chasing
    its tail.  I notice the same effect when I am forced to stick to a structured
    schedule, or am overloaded with correspondence via modern communications. I often
    marvel how anyone in this century gets anything done at all of tangible value
    since the advent of email and the blackberry. The cynical side of me believes
    that people have allowed themselves to confuse activity with actual work.  According
    to my friends in the corporate world, if you are not going to meetings or answering
    emails  you apparently aren’t getting anything done.

  zh: 当我没有时间做这些事情时，我注意到我的创造力受到影响，我经常会以循环的方式解决问题——就像狗追着自己的尾巴一样。当我被迫遵守一个结构化的日程安排，或者被现代通讯方式的通讯过载时，我也会注意到同样的效果。我经常惊讶于在这个世纪，自从电子邮件和黑莓出现以来，有人如何做出任何有形价值的事情。我内心愤世嫉俗的一面认为，人们允许自己将活动与实际工作混淆了。根据我在企业界的朋友的说法，如果你不参加会议或回复电子邮件，显然你什么也没做。
- en: Trading is the same way– its easy to think of yourself as a pro trader simply
    because you get up every day in the morning and follow the news on Bloomberg or
    Reuters before the open. Its easy to think you are a pro simply because you have
    your own proprietary tools, and you have a cool workstation. Maybe you think that
    you will be successful simply because you are diligent and have a disciplined
    routine. Perhaps you fancy yourself a player because you place dozens of trades
    a day. Well the truth is that many of these activities are potentially positive,
    but the real trick is to recognize that it is not enough to look and act the part
    of a trader. It is not enough to just try to stay unflinchingly consistent in
    executing your gameplan. ***You have to sometimes shake things up, and think of
    new ways to make money–because the truth is, while you are settling into your
    comfort zone, someone else is trying to figure out a plan to eat your lunch.***

  zh: 交易也是如此 - 很容易认为自己是一名专业交易员，只是因为你每天早上起床并在开盘前关注彭博社或路透社的新闻。很容易认为你是一名专业人士，只是因为你拥有自己的专有工具，还有一个酷炫的工作站。也许你认为你会成功，只是因为你勤奋并有纪律的日常安排。也许你认为自己是一名玩家，因为你每天进行几十次交易。好吧，事实是这些活动中很多都是潜在积极的，但真正的诀窍是要认识到，光是看起来和表现得像一名交易员是不够的。仅仅试图保持不动摇地执行你的计划也不够。***有时你必须改变策略，想出新的赚钱方式
    - 因为事实是，当你陷入舒适区时，其他人正在想办法吃掉你的午餐。***
- en: Every week you should try to make some time to think outside of the box. Read
    or re-read a new trading book (note I re-read my books sometimes 4-5 times). Spend
    some time on system design- but force yourself to tackle something new or something
    that you have had trouble solving in the past.  Try to learn a new instrument,
    or search for a new type of trading setup to compliment your most reliable methods
    so you having something to fall back on if things get tough. Trading is like nature–always
    evolving and different species thrive or die off as environments change. I can
    recall many “pros” in my poker playing days that wanted to always play the same
    way and were often in denial when their drawdowns lasted much longer than luck
    would dictate. They resisted change right up until the bitter end–until even the
    weakest players figured them out and milked them dry. Friends of mine who survived
    and even went on to win major tournaments were always looking to improve and try
    new strategies–while respecting that they would not completely re-define their
    game in doing so. They focused on  figuring out how to win in the most efficient
    manner even while being very efficient winners.

  zh: 每周你应该抽出一些时间去打破常规思维。阅读或重新阅读一本新的交易书籍（注意，我有时会将我的书重新阅读4-5次）。花一些时间进行系统设计 - 但强迫自己尝试一些新东西，或者是你过去曾经有困难解决的事情。尝试学习一种新的乐器，或者寻找一种新类型的交易设置来补充你最可靠的方法，这样如果情况变得困难，你就有东西可以借鉴。交易就像自然界一样
    - 不断进化，不同的物种随着环境的变化而蓬勃发展或灭绝。我还记得我在打扑克牌的日子里有很多“专家”总是想以同样的方式玩，当他们的回撤持续时间比运气要长得多时，他们经常否认。他们一直抵制变化，直到最后一刻
    - 直到连最弱的玩家都了解他们并把他们榨干。我的一些朋友在生存下来甚至赢得了重大比赛后，总是在寻求改进和尝试新的策略 - 同时尊重他们在这样做时不会完全重新定义他们的游戏。他们专注于找出如何以最有效的方式获胜，即使是非常高效的赢家也是如此。
- en: 'Think of some of the pioneers in the trading world: 1) Jesse Livermore 2) Nicholas
    Darvas 3) William O’Neil 4) Paul Tudor Jones. All of these people approached the
    market with a unique insight that allowed them to reach levels far beyond anyone
    else. They all worked hard and tried to constantly re-invent or re-invigorate
    their methods with sometimes costly experiments.  Its not enough to just be discipline,
    and its not enough to just be smart or knowledgeable. Universities these days
    are teeming with people like that. You need to step away from your routines and
    away from the crowd and be different.  Treat your most reliable trading methods
    as part of a discplined routine–like flossing your teeth. But take some time to
    think carefully outside of the box and add to your strategy mix, otherwise you
    face two possible undesirable outcomes: 1) you may get bored and find diversions
    through impulsive and costly mistakes 2) you may face a sudden struggle for survival
    if your bread and butter trades are no longer working.'

  zh: 想想交易界的一些先驱：1) 杰西·利弗莫尔 2) 尼古拉斯·达尔瓦斯 3) 威廉·奥尼尔 4) 保罗·图多·琼斯。所有这些人都以独特的见解来对待市场，使他们能够达到远远超出其他人的水平。他们都努力工作，并试图通过有时代价高昂的实验不断重新发明或重新激活他们的方法。仅仅有纪律是不够的，仅仅聪明或有知识也不够。如今的大学充斥着像这样的人。你需要远离你的常规和人群，与众不同。把你最可靠的交易方法视为一个有纪律的例行程序，就像洗牙一样。但是花一些时间认真思考，并且超越常规，加入到你的策略组合中，否则你将面临两种可能的不良后果：1)
    你可能会因为冲动和昂贵的错误而感到无聊并分心 2) 如果你的主要交易不再有效，你可能会面临突如其来的生存斗争。
