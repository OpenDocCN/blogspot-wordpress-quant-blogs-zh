    tells me it's too early to be buying. We need to wait for more pain and panic
    to materialize. My inner investor says that signs of value are starting to show
    up in a number of natural resource sectors and it's time to start accumulating
    positions in resource cyclicals.

    supports selling right now is one where Spain crashes, doesn't receive assistance,
    defaults and the euro and then Europe break up. Now call us picky but though that
    indeed is one potential outcome there are a lot of other scenarios and most of
    them involve some internal resolve, even if it does involve printing your amount
    of money. Elections may change the leaders of some countries but as the UK Con/Lib
    coalition is finding out, they are but the tip of the iceberg of the machine that
    is government. There is enough mass below the waterline that knows where its true
    interests lie to stymie any threats to them. Yes Minister indeed.

    return of the Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index compared to the market. Cyclicals
    are underperforming and they have been in a relative downtrend after topping out
    in early February. By contrast, defensive sectors such as Consumer Staples and
    Utilities have been bottoming out relative to the market this year and recently
    started to outperform.

    market fortunes. While there is downside risk, tail risk is likely to be mitigated
    by the Draghi Put and the near-by presence of major technical support that stretch
    back to the mid 1990's.
