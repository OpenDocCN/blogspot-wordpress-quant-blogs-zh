- en: Anticipation is building over the FOMC decision, which is scheduled for this
    coming Wednesday. Leading up to the meeting, there had been growing speculation
    over whether the Fed would hike by 75 or 100 bps. Market expectations had been
    oscillating wildly, but it has now settled into a consensus of 75 bps, followed
    by a pause in late 2022 and rate cuts that begin in mid-2023.
