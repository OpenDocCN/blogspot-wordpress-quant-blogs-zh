# Architecture Driven By Tools | Tales from a Trading Desk

## Architecture Driven By Tools

Just a classic [video](http://vimeo.com/43612849) to watch.  Robert Martin provide some clear direction on what an architecture  should provide, and how people think “tools” are architecture.  I am still appalled at the number of supposed “software engineers” who can’t provide an architecture for the solution they are working on.  Tools 😦  Madness.  I suggest that anyone who works with me watch this video, and continue watching it 🙂

Commit late to certain decisions
