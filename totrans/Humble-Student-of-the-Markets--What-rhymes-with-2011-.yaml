    was characterized by a debt ceiling impasse in Washington and a Greek Crisis in
    Europe that threatened the very existence of the eurozone. I can remember endless
    European summits and plans to make plans for Greece. The news flow worsened and
    it seemed like no one was in charge in Europe, but the S&P 500 tested support
    multiple times while exhibiting a series of positive RSI divergences. The logjam
    was finally broken when the ECB stepped in and announced its LTRO program. Stocks
    bottomed and never looked back.

    by a debt ceiling impasse in Washington and concerns over inflationary pressures
    which may or may not be transitory from supply chain bottlenecks. The logjam appears
    to have been temporarily broken when the Democrats and Republicans agreed to kick
    the can down the road and revisit the debt ceiling question in December. Stock
    prices duly staged a relief rally.
