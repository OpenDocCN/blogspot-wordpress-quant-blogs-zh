    is clear: Gone are the days of open-ended hyper growth. Significantly, this message

    on a “mass line” education campaign aimed at addressing problems arising from
    the “four winds” of formalism, bureaucracy, hedonism and extravagance underscores
    a new sense of political discipline directed at the Chinese Communist Party. The

    need for fair and stable economic underpinnings.'

    growth dynamic, one of the pillars for a consumer-led Chinese economy, is consistent
    with a marked downshift in trend GDP growth. That’s because services generate
    about 30 percent more jobs per unit of Chinese output than do manufacturing and
    construction – allowing China to hit its all-important labor absorption and social
    stability goals with economic growth in the 7 to 8 percent range rather than 10
    percent as before. Similarly, a more disciplined and market-based allocation of
    credit tempers the excesses of uneconomic investments, necessary if China is to
    begin absorbing its surplus saving to spur consumer demand.

    With the American consumer on ice for more than five years – underscored by average
    annualized growth of just 0.9 percent in inflation-adjusted consumption expenditures
    since the first quarter of 2008 – the US is in desperate need of a new source
    of economic growth. China is America’s third largest and most rapidly growing
    export market. Washington negotiators should push hard on market access, ensuring
    that US companies and their workers have the opportunity to capitalize on China’s
    transformation.

    At 43 percent of its GDP, China has the smallest services sector of any major
    economy in the world. Under reasonable assumptions, the scale of Chinese services
    could increase by around $12 trillion by 2025\. Increasingly tradable in a connected
    world, the coming explosion in Chinese services could translate into a windfall,
    up to $6 trillion, for foreign services companies from retail trade and transportation
    to hotels and finance. For the United States, with the world’s largest and most
    dynamic services sector, this could be an extraordinary opportunity. US negotiators
    should push especially hard for access to Chinese services markets.

    the world should try to understand the stakes, and accommodate China's transition
    to a more sustainable growth model. As policymakers in China continue to try to
    restructure the economy away from reliance on massive, debt-fueling investment
    projects that create little value for the economy, the United States, Europe,
    and Japan must implement policies that reduce trade pressures. Any additional
    adverse trade conditions will further jeopardize the stability of China's economy,
    especially as lower trade surpluses and decreased foreign investment slow money
    creation by China's central bank. A trade war would clearly be devastating for
    Beijing's attempt to rebalance its economy and have potentially critical implications
    for global markets.

    will grow at roughly 7 percent over the next few years can be safely ignored.
    ***Growth driven by consumption, instead of trade and investment, is alone sufficient
    to grow China's GDP by 3 to 4 percent annually. But it is not clear that consumption
    can be sustained if investment growth levels are sharply reduced.*** If Beijing
    can successfully manage the employment consequences of decreased investment growth,
    perhaps it can keep consumption growing at current levels. But that's a tricky
    proposition.

    grow at 3-4%. If the Chinese economy changes the tone of its growth from investment
    and infrastructure to consumer led growth, the consensus of growth in the 7% range
    is unrealistic.

    and duration of this crisis. If the Chinese address the issue quickly and move
    decisively to rein in credit expansion and accept a period of much lower growth,
    they may be able to use the government and People’s Bank of China’s balance sheet
    to cushion the adjustment in the economy. ***If, however, they continue on the
    current path and allow this deterioration to reach its natural and logical limit,
    we will likely see a full scale recession as well as a collapse in asset and real
    estate prices sometime next year***.

    start to draw down its surplus saving and current-account surplus. That could
