    will always be backward looking and lag the real-time volatility environment.
    When [volatility trends](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/10/vix-in-context-of-historical-volatility.html),
    as it has over the course of the past two months, this phenomenon is less evident.
    In the current market environment, however, where both stocks and [implied volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/implied%20volatility)
    measures such as the VIX are reversing, many measures of historical volatility
    begin to seem no more useful than driving on a winding road using the rear view
    mirror.

- en: The graph below shows that while the 30 day historical volatility in the SPX
    peaked a week ago, it has only fallen 4% since that time. Not surprisingly, the
    50 day historical volatility measure has been even less responsive to recent market
    changes and has entered a plateau phase, seemingly oblivious to the recent changes
    in volatility. By contrast, the 10 day historical volatility measure has dropped
    27%; it has more accurately mirrored the VIX and perhaps even hinted at a coming
    VIX reversal when it topped three days before the VIX did.

- en: Ten day historical volatility is erratic and prone to readings that reflect
    a low signal to noise ratio. When volatility is changing quickly, however, 10
    day historical volatility is frequently a better proxy for the VIX and a more
    meaningful baseline for comparison than its 30 day sibling.
