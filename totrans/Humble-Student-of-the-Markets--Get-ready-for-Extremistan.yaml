    – with at least three or four one-on-one meetings a week – on China and market
    conditions. It worries me that recently I have heard investors say many times,
    generally very sophisticated investors, that we are clearly in a bubble and the
    best strategy is to ride it out as long as we can. This has almost become one
    of the mantras of sophisticated investors – the less sophisticated, I guess, assuming
    that the crisis is safely behind us.

    bail out before everyone else does. ***I wonder if this means that an awful lot
    of the big funds can be expected to rush to the doors at the same time when things
    turn bleak. If so, of course, that means we are likely to see both the upside
    and the downside market risks increase.*** Several of my fund management friends
    have insisted the problem has to do with the nature of hedge fund compensation.
    Most of the hedge funds were hurt pretty badly in the financial crisis, but a
    very large number of them were very pleasantly surprised by how quickly they’ve
    been able to make back a substantial share of their losses.

    do not reward investors who buy and hold, or the institutions that disdain cash.
    As a kid growing up in the Midwest, during July and August, I always wore a t-shirt
    and shorts and wore a crew cut. In January and February, my hair was longer and
    I never went outside in shorts and a t-shirt. (Well maybe once on a dare.) If
    my parents had known, they would have rhetorically asked me if I was stupid. So
    here’s a worthwhile question. ***Why do investment professionals advise their
    clients to simply buy and hold, whether we are in a period of stability or instability?***

    asset classes by 10% or more during the test period. As the chart below shows,
    the Inflation-Deflation Timer slightly outperformed a 60% stock/40% bond portfolio
    in “normal” times and stood out during crisis periods. Downside risk was slightly
    better than the 60/40 balanced fund.
