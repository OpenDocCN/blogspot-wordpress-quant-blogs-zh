    for this preference is often arbitrary– being a function of time zone, past trading
    successes, or a preference for market behavior. One question many traders fail
    to ask is: How tradeable is a market? The truth is that not all markets offer
    good opportunities to make money. A poor market will have: 1) low and sporadic
    liquidity 2) a high but unpredictable degree of noise 3) few if any discernible
    patters or anomalies. Measuring how good a market is cannot be biased by trading
    style, it should consider the overall profitability of different types of trading
    methods. The only way to do that is to create a diverse set of quantitative strategies
    and test the average  and maximum profitability that could be achieved by different
    styles. This diverse set should be spread across varying parameters to be useful
    for generalization.  At this point, we can calculate one key component in determining
    how tradeable a market is by looking at the PQ or Profitability Quotient:'

    changes in closing prices over 252 days

    a market is likely to be assuming liquidity is sufficient. A high PQ suggests
    that the market offers either abundant alpha across many different strategies,
    or contains one strategy category that is highly lucrative.
