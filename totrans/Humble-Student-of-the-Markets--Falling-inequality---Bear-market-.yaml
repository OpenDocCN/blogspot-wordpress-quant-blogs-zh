    growth in real wages would tend to increase the share of profits in GDP, and therefore

    (reducing taxes and increasing subsidies on the poor) or by reducing interest
    rates set by the central banks. Since the fiscal response results in bigger budget
    deficits and higher public debt/GDP ratios, more and more of the burden of policy
    adjustment eventually falls on the monetary authorities. ***It is likely that

    ratios are also likely to rise through time. Falling real interest rates increase
    the incentive to borrow, while rising asset prices, especially in the housing
    market, increase credit worthiness and therefore the ability to borrow.

    force for the entire long term process of rising wealth, i.e. the drop in the
    labour share in national income. If this were to reverse, demand would rise more
    rapidly and real interest rates could be allowed to increase, bringing down the
    rate of growth in private debt. Although this would be healthy from many points
    of view, it would also deliver a double blow to equities by reducing expected
    profits growth and raising discount rates.

    a trend as the economics of offshoring jobs to low-cost countries becomes less

    local (within country) inequality without paying attention to how global inequality
    evolves. Under the scenario that I outlined, the relative winners of the onshoring
    drive would be the DM middle class, the relative losers the EM middle class. But
    since the owners of capital directed the re-allocation of capital from one region
    to another, it is hard to believe that they would lose ground on a relative basis.
