# Agile At Sea – Business Requirements | Tales from a Trading Desk

## Agile At Sea – Business Requirements

Every now and again I come across a team that is at sea with agile.  These teams have decided to throw out the concept of business requirements and anything else that is deemed old world, and moved to an agile backlog that fails to capture the business requirements in any shape or form 😦  The backlog is effectively orthogonality to any sensible good practice Scrum backlog.  [Business Analysis Times](http://www.batimes.com/articles/developing-effective-agile-requirements-relies-on-both-user-stories-and-use-cases.html) captures this quite nicely with the following quote:

> Story is the smallest valuable business requirement that follows the INVEST attributes

Business requirements, use cases, sequence diagrams, UML etc may all be old world, but at the end of the day team need to understand that the basic principles of software engineering still standing, and the past 20+ years has generated some very valid principles that should still be used today.
