    only trades about once per month on average. I’m please to say that while the
    SPX was down 7.57% for the 1st half of the year, the QE Big Time Swing System
    managed to post a 0.93% gain.

    from that perspective, the fact that it has weathered such historically abnormal
    action the last six months is inspiring. January saw the market experience an
    abnormally sharp and persistent selloff. This was followed by one of the most
    persistent upmoves ever from Feb – April. We then had to deal with a one of a
    kind "flash crash" and then more extreme action culminating in a wicked selloff
    at the end of June that triggered numerous historical extremes.

- en: With all that to think about, buy/sell decisions were easy for QE Big Time Swing
    traders. SPY had 7 trades trigger. Using the system, entries and exits are clearly
    defined and there are no extraneous variables to worry about. Of the 7 SPY trades,
    4 were winners and 3 were losers for a net of 0.93% including commissions, dividends,
    and interest on cash (assumed at 0.16% annual this year). Again, not great, but
    not bad considering all the market dealt us the last 6 months.

    and exits as published in the manual and sent to purchasers via email (free for
    2010). One of the biggest advantages with the QE Big Time Swing System is that
    it is all open-coded and comes complete with a substantial amount of background
    historical research. Many system owners have either incorporated ideas for “tweaking”
    from the manual or used their own ideas to customize the system. Anyone doing
    this would have experienced different results.
