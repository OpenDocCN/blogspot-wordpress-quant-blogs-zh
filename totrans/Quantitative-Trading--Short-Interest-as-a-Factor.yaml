- en: Indeed, short interest (expressed as the number of shares shorted divided by
    the total number of shares outstanding) has long been thought to be a useful factor.
    To me, the counter-intuitive wisdom is that the more a stock is shorted, the better
    is its performance. You might explain that by saying this is a result of the "short
    squeeze", when there is jump in price perhaps due to news and stock lenders are
    eager to sell the stock they own. If you have borrowed this stock to short, your
    borrowed stock may be recalled and you will be forced to buy cover at this most
    inopportune time. But this is an unsatisfactory explanation, as this will result
    only in a short term (upward) momentum in price, not the sustained out-performance
    of the most shorted stocks. This long-term out-performance seems to suggest that
    short sellers are less informed than the average trader, which is odd.

    best years for this factor (hence the impressive chart above). For that year,
    a daily-rebalanced long-short portfolio (long 50 most shorted stocks and short
    50 least shorted stocks in the SPX) returned 6.9%, with a Sharpe ratio of 2 and
    a Calmar ratio of 2.9\. However, if we extend our backtest to 2007, the APR is
    only 2.8%, with a Sharpe ratio of 0.5 and a Calmar ratio of 0.3\. This backtest
    was done using survivorship-bias-free data from CRSP, with short interest data
    provided by Compustat.

    possibly meaning that short-sellers of small caps do have superior information.
