    to the 1999/2000 top, where MACD had gone negative in late 1999, rose and declined
    again in early 2000 as a precursor to the 2000 market top. Fast forward to today,
    MACD went negative in January 2015, rose in February and went negative again in
    March. However, I am comforted by the fact that this model is better at forecasting
    direction than magnitude. Given the lack of catalyst for a major bear market,
    my best guess is that any weakness will be more comparable to the market experience
    in 2010 or 2011 - a minor hiccup.
