# Humble Student of the Markets: Should you hop on the reflation train?

**Mid-week market update**

: About two weeks ago, I identified an emerging theme of a rotation out of large cap growth stocks into cyclicals (see

[Sector and factor review: Not your father's cycle](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2020/08/08/sector-and-factor-review-not-your-fathers-cycle/)

). The latest BoA Global Fund Manager Survey (FMS) confirms my analysis. The rotation is attributable to managers buying into the reflation trade.

Does that mean you should hop on the reflation train? Is there sufficient momentum behind this shift?
