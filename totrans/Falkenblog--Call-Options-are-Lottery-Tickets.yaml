- en: In theory, far out-of-the-money call options should offer extremely high expected
    returns as a percent of their price. As underlying stocks always, in practice,
    have positive betas against ‘the market’, all calls will have positive betas that
    exceed the beta of the underlying stock, and call betas will increase in the strike
    price as the calls get further out-of-the-money. Hence, all calls will have positive
    expected returns and the expected returns will be larger for greater strike prices,
    because the betas increase as you go out of the money. Theoretically, beta—or
    any covariance with the elusive SDF—measures the ‘how much’ of risk, and so if
    risk is priced, higher options with higher strike prices (ie, more out-of-the-money),
    have higher beta(s), which implies higher average return.

    strike price of 120, expiring in 3 months. If the stock price rises to 110 over
    the next month, the call option will rise 120%, while a long stock position rises
    only 10%. This is the implicit leverage in an option, that is, it is like being
    able to borrow 10 times one’s capital and invest in the market. It is exactly
    the same bet, just higher powered.

    calls have average returns of −37% over a month! The chart above shows that if
    you bucket call options into groups based on their ‘deltas’, which is a measure
    of how sensitive they are to the market, you find that call options, indeed, are
    indeed highly levered stock positions. Remembering that the average stock has
    a beta of 1.0, these betas range from 4 to 15—giving one 4 to 15 times the juice
    of the daily return. An option's beta is the beta of the stock, times the '

    change in the stock price. Not only is the average return negative for call options,
    these returns get worse, the more implicitly levered, the more ‘risky’, the options
    become. Returns are negatively correlated with the betas on those options. This
    has been corroborated by several other studies, including'

    options, and just like the lottery, the average payout is worse, they more ‘risk’
    one takes. If there’s a risk premium in equities, it certainly is not amplified
    in options in any way, because you lose money, on average, buying leverage market
    positions via call options.
