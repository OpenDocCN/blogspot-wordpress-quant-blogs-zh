- en: In theory, far out-of-the-money call options should offer extremely high expected
    returns as a percent of their price. As underlying stocks always, in practice,
    have positive betas against ‘the market’, all calls will have positive betas that
    exceed the beta of the underlying stock, and call betas will increase in the strike
    price as the calls get further out-of-the-money. Hence, all calls will have positive
    expected returns and the expected returns will be larger for greater strike prices,
    because the betas increase as you go out of the money. Theoretically, beta—or
    any covariance with the elusive SDF—measures the ‘how much’ of risk, and so if
    risk is priced, higher options with higher strike prices (ie, more out-of-the-money),
    have higher beta(s), which implies higher average return.

  zh: 从理论上讲，远离实值的购买期权应该能提供非常高的预期收益率，占其价格的百分比。由于基础股票实际上总是相对于‘市场’具有正的贝塔值，所有购买期权都会有高于基础股票贝塔值的正贝塔值，而且当购买期权距离实值越远时，购买期权的贝塔值会随行权价的增加而增加。因此，所有买入期权都将有正的预期收益，并且随着行权价的增加，预期收益也会增大，因为随着购买期权的远离实值，贝塔值会增加。理论上，贝塔－或者是与难以捕捉的SDF的任何协方差－度量了‘多少’风险，因此如果风险被定价，具有更高行权价的更高期权（例如，更远离实值的期权）具有更高的贝塔值，这意味着更高的平均收益率。
- en: For example, say you have a stock with a price of 100, and buy a call with a
    strike price of 120, expiring in 3 months. If the stock price rises to 110 over
    the next month, the call option will rise 120%, while a long stock position rises
    only 10%. This is the implicit leverage in an option, that is, it is like being
    able to borrow 10 times one’s capital and invest in the market. It is exactly
    the same bet, just higher powered.

  zh: 例如，假设您有一只股价为100美元的股票，并购买一份行权价为120美元的期权，期限为3个月。如果股票价格在接下来的一个月上涨到110美元，购买期权将上涨120%，而持有股票的头寸却只会上涨10%。这是期权隐含的杠杆作用，就像能够借出10倍于自己资本的资金并投资市场。这是完全相同的赌注，只是更高效。

- en: (2001). Investors basically are overpaying for lottery tickets when they buy
    options, and just like the lottery, the average payout is worse, they more ‘risk’
    one takes. If there’s a risk premium in equities, it certainly is not amplified
    in options in any way, because you lose money, on average, buying leverage market
    positions via call options.

  zh: (2001)。当投资者购买期权时，基本上就像是在购买彩票一样，而且就像彩票一样，平均回报率更低，他们承担的‘风险’越大。如果股票市场存在风险溢价，那么期权市场绝对没有以任何方式放大，因为平均而言，购买看涨期权来获得杠杆市场头寸会亏损资金。
