[The Aggregator](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2008/07/quantifiable-edges-aggregator.html)

has been a terrific tool that has helped me greatly in both my index swing trading and for

.

The Aggregator System is based on the Aggregator and it calls for a position of 100% long, 100% short, or 100% cash. For my own trading I will often scale in and out of positions depending on factors such as the strength of the evidence, perceived risk, recent market volatility, the underlying trend, my intermediate-term outlook, and more. Still, the Aggregator System can be (and is) traded mechanically. After two stellar years (2008 and 2009) it hit a rough patch last summer. But more recently the Aggregator System has been on fire. Below is a chart showing every entry and exit signal since around Thanksgiving.
