    without affecting the marketplace. The trading has to be broken up into a lot
    of small blocks, according to different strategies. The firm also has to be able
    to switch strategies in mid-stream. This requires monitoring the marketplace in
    real time, and keeping an intraday history of the stocks that you are interested
    in.

    is everything. You want to get yourselves out there faster than all of your competitors.
    Latency can be affected by many factors, from speed of the networks to inefficient
    locking algorithms in your code. There is also a need for experience in smart
    order routing, which means that you might get to work with some kind of rules
    engine, like ILog Rules.

    is for Merrill, Bear Stearns or RBC, then most likely that Wombat is being used,otherwise
    most likely Reuters.'

    being used to hold tick history. Other solutions in this area include KDB+, Vhayu,
    StreamBase, and some of the newer players that I have talked about on this blog
    in the past. These newer time-series databases can be used to perform complex
    event processing on the incoming tick stream.'

    to cache queries to the reference data. The use of Times Ten may mean that you

    get your messages to and from the exchanges.'

    I would expect to see a .NET front-end here. The fact that .NET is not on the

    .NET front-ends are "de riguer".'

    might lead me to believe that this position was for a hedge fund, but the first
    line tells me that it is a top-tier global brokerage firm. If you take the word
    "Brokerage" literally, then this would eliminate Lehman, Goldman, and Bear Stearns.
    Base salaries go from about a low of 130K to about 160K, with 150K being the norm.
    So, if the total comp was 150K, then you are not getting much of a bonus, are
    you? Let's take 150K as being the base. Lehman had about 60-80% bonuses this year
    and Morgan Stanley had about 45-55%. Except for Goldman, you are probably not
    going to get 100% bonus for a Java/C++ developer role from one of the other firms.
    So, I would take the 300K figure with a HUGE grain of salt, and look more at 210-225K
    as total comp.
