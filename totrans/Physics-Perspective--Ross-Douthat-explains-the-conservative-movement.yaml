- en: 'by Ross Douthat in the New York Times is a must read, as it is a kind of confession
    of what the Conservative Movement really wants, according to Douthat. What really
    has them so angry, he says, is the history of the last 40 years or so during which,
    even when the Republicans were in power, they were unable to roll back the various
    programs they hate so much that were established from the 1930s to the 1960s.
    Mostly because they discovered, quite inconveniently, that most people in America
    want those programs. He quotes Conservative Dave Frum from the early 1990s:'

    a testing and disillusioning time. Conservatives owned the executive branch for
    eight years and had great influence over it for four more; they dominated the
    Senate for six years; and by the end of the decade they exercised near complete
    control over the federal judiciary. And yet, every time they reached to undo the
    work of Franklin Roosevelt, Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon — the work they had
    damned for nearly half a century — they felt the public’s wary eyes upon them.
    They didn’t dare, and they realized that they didn’t dare. Their moment came and
    flickered. And as the power of the conservative movement slowly ebbed after 1986,
    and then roared away in 1992, the conservatives who had lived through that attack
    of faintheartedness shamefacedly felt that they had better hurry up and find something
    else to talk about …

    they long for are more or less completely out of tune with what most Americans
    want. Or, as Douthat prefers to rather crazily phrase it , "American political
    reality really does seem to have a liberal bias." (Isn't reality, by definition,
    unbiased??) In other words, if most people don't agree with me, they must be biased.

    and Americans have repeatedly--in both elections and opinion polls--indicated
    that there isn't just majority support--but super-majority support for maintaining
    and even strengthening the programs that formed the heart of the New Deal (Social
    Security) and the Great Society (Medicare)"

    that Mellon served as Treasury Secretary--one could be forgiven for wondering
    why Mellon's heirs are not suing the right for plagiarism.

    what do they imagine would fill the vacuum? Do they expect an 18th century agrarian
    society to spring up spontaneously? This small government fantasy might have made
    sense in the early twentieth century, when they were opposing FDR. It was even
    a silly but excusable delusion through the late twentieth century. But now it's
    clear that the era of the rugged individual, small town values, and decentralized
    authority is long gone. In its place we have an interdependent worldwide economy,
    multinational corporations with revenues larger than the gdp of most nations,
    global terror networks capable of engaging in effective asymmetrical warfare,
    and a rising foreign middle class competing with us for jobs and resources while
    our own middle class is shrinking.

    continuing to seek greater efficiencies in its dealings, and keeping markets reasonably
    unfettered, and protecting individual liberties. But government actually gets
    smaller (enough to drown it in Grover Norquist's bathtub for instance) whatever
    accretion of power takes it place will certainly be much less humane, enlightened,
    or accountable to the masses than what we have now. Some fighting for this small
    government fantasy are well aware that they are really fighting for corporate
    plutocracy (such as the Kochs) but most have just been duped.

    True enough. The American people don;t want Wall Street brokers handling their
    Social Security or vouchers for their Medicare and seem to like what the ACA (as
    opposed to "Obamacare") has to offer so far.
