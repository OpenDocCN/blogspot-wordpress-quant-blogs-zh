    banks are engaged in a coordinated round of tightening. Fed Governor Lael Brainard
    put on the table the prospect of quantitative tightening, or a reduction of the
    Fed balance sheet, in a speech last week. This was confirmed by the release of
    the March FOMC minutes which revealed the Fed is targeting $95 billion in balance
    sheet reduction per month. Cue the fears about the effects of falling liquidity
    on stock prices.
