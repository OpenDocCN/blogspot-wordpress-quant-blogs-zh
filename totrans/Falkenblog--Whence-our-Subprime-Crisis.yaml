    context of the abolition of elected represesntatives (because they will always
    bail out any industry whose collapse would cause a 'systemic risk') or you can
    accept that the market needs to be regulated and interfered with a good deal more
    than it is.

    morally good, no risk--led to the overreach. Clearly many players all were necessary,
    none sufficient.
