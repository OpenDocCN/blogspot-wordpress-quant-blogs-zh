    in evaluating how investors are thinking in terms of contagion risk, be it political
    or economic – or at the very least in terms of the breadth and depth of the economic
    impact of specific events.

    I endeavor to track some elements of the relative geographical spread of concern
    with a handful of ETFs. The baseline ETF, [EGPT](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EGPT),
    shows how the situation deteriorated over the long weekend in the U.S. from January
    14^(th) to January 18^(th), then began to accelerate downward during the January
    26^(th) trading session.

    ETF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/frontier%20ETFs), [FRN](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/FRN),
    and three single-country ETFs: Turkey ([TUR](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TUR));
    Israel ([EIS](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EIS)); and South Africa
    ([EZA](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EZA)). Of this group, the Turkey
    ETF has proven to be the most volatile during the crisis and also suffered the
    largest drawdown. Interestingly, the Israel ETF has been the least volatile of
    the group, but the only one which appeared not to find a bottom on January 28^(th)
    and continued to trend lower. The top performer of the group is EZA, the South
    African ETF. EZA has fallen slightly more than half as far as EGPT since the beginning
    of the crisis and has steadily gained strength during the past week. Among country
    ETFs, EGPT and TUR were the top two performers during the past week.'
