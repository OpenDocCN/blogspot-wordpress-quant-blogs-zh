    has been concentrated in near-term budget changes, which, taken together, could
    create a significant headwind for the economic recovery. ***The CBO estimates
    that deficit-reduction policies in current law will slow the pace of real GDP
    growth by about 1-1/2 percentage points this year, relative to what it would have
    been otherwise***. A significant portion of this effect is related to the automatic
    spending sequestration that is scheduled to begin on March 1, ***which, according
    to the CBO's estimates, will contribute about 0.6 percentage point to the fiscal
    drag on economic growth this year***. Given the still-moderate underlying pace
    of economic growth, this additional near-term burden on the recovery is significant.
    Moreover, besides having adverse effects on jobs and incomes, a slower recovery
    would lead to less actual deficit reduction in the short run for any given set
    of fiscal actions.
