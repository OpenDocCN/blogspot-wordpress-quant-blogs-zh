    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    signal. A bullish Trend Model signal that gets less bullish is a trading "sell"
    signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading
    "buy" signal. The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of
    the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. Past trading of
    the trading model has shown turnover rates of about 200% per month.

    is global in scope. As the 20-year monthly chart below of the Dow Jones Global
    Index (DJW) shows, the last two tops were preceded by negative RSI divergences.
    So far, DJW is barely overbought and has not even had the opportunity to exhibit
    a negative RSI divergence. This suggests that global equities can continue to
    grind higher, and the ultimate top is, at a minimum, several months away.

    Drilling down to the weekly chart, DJW has shown a pattern of flashing double
    RSI overbought sell signals. In the past, the index has achieved a first RSI peak
    overbought reading (dark vertical line) which was followed by a second RSI peak
    (red vertical line). DJW has recently shown the same double overbought peak pattern,
    and, if history is any guide, the market is likely to stage a minor pullback.

    trade, though some minor pause may be necessary. This scenario is consistent with
    current macro and fundamental readings that are supportive of a reflationary driven
    equity advance..
