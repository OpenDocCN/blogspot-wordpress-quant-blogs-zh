## Can Microsoft Finally Offer a Better DataSynapse+Excel Solution?

Over the last few years numerous investment banks have been using their [DataSynapse](http://www.datasynapse.com/) grids to run Excel. Does [Microsoft](http://blogs.technet.com/windowshpc/archive/2009/11/17/hpc-team-is-proud-to-release-our-beta-1-of-hpc-pack-2008-r2-windows-hpc-server-2008-r2.aspx) finally have a solution that is better? Windows HPC Server 2008 R2 and distributed Microsoft Office Excel 2010 for the [cluster](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2009/nov09/11-16sc09pr.mspx). “support for deploying, running and managing clusters up to 1,000 nodes” still appears a bit on the small size given some of the grids the sell-side has.
