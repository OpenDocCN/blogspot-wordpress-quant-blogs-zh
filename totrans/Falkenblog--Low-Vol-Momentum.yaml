- en: So, I was in Boston talking about low volatility to a couple of groups. I met
    a couple of current practitioners and it is very interesting to hear about the
    different approaches these guys take. They tend to have very different takes on
    what is going on, and what investors really care about, and these subtle differences
    lead to very different portfolios if you are talking about choosing 100 stocks
    out of 2000 possible.

    2000 个可能的股票中选出 100 支的话。

    because simply trying to be better than a competitor is risky: there''s at least
    a 50% chance of failure, and possibly higher because it might degrade into a simple
    price war that leads to no prices ('

- en: At my Qwafafew talk (during which, I quaffed a few--beer and finance are complements),
    there was a true believer in the audience defending the conventional wisdom, which
    was actually quite refreshing. I like actually engaging with them because they
    generally don't argue with me, adopting the debating tactic of hoping an embarrassing
    criticism will go away if you ignore it. They have been doing that to me for years.
    Anyway, he insisted that beta was positively correlated with average returns,
    you merely had to measure beta correctly. I can't prove it can't be done, but
    I haven't seen it, and I'm pretty certain any journal would publish such a result
    asap, so I'm skeptical.

  zh: 在我参加 Qwafafew 的演讲中（期间我喝了几杯啤酒，金融是互补的），有位观众是传统智慧的坚定信徒，这样的人其实相当令人耳目一新。我喜欢和他们真正地辩论，因为他们通常不会和我争论，而是选择忽略一些尴尬的批评来回避辩论。他们这样做已经持续了好几年了。不管怎样，他坚持认为
    beta 与平均收益呈正相关，只是要正确衡量 beta 就行了。我不能证明不能这样做，但我没见过，而且我很确定任何专业期刊都会尽快发表这样的结果，所以我持怀疑态度。
- en: I'm even more skeptical because when I asked him if he would agree that beta
    is positively correlated with total variance, he said, 'not necessarily!' as if
    this was some great gotcha point. Correlations refer to statistical relationships,
    meaning, there are some datapoints off the linear relationship. Clearly,

    about risk and return are about averages and tendencies; the distinction about
    there being exceptions to financial generalizations is not like saying there are
    exceptions to gravity. I thought he was really reaching if that's the kind of
    counterargument to my assertion that risk and return aren't correlated in general.

  zh: 股票的方差和 beta 高低可能相反，但所有关于风险和回报的讨论都是关于平均值和趋势的；有关金融一般规律会有例外的区分，并不像说引力有例外。我觉得如果这就是他反驳我风险和回报一般不相关的论点，那他的逻辑非常牵强。
- en: 'He did bring up the point that I tended to put up data on geometric averages,
    and that arithmetic averages would generally be more consistent with the theory
    because the arithmetic returns are greater than their geometric averages by a
    variance term. That''s a valid point, but only geometric averages uniquely correspond
    to total period returns, and so the geometric average is to my mind a better statistic
    of a portfolio''s performance. Further, this is why the scope of my findings are
    so important: across many asset classes, the average returns are generally flat.
    Average returns are unbiased estimates of future total returns, but then sometimes
    one should see massive outperformance by these high volatility portfolios, which
    we do not. It''s a complicated issue, and I can''t treat it sufficiently in this
    point, but I should mention that while I think this is one of the best arguments
    by the risk-begets-return crowd, it still fails empirically.'

- en: Then there's the issue of overcrowding that always seems to come up. I find
    this rather amusing, because when I was trying to sell this idea in the 1990's,
    before anyone thought it would work, a common argument was that 'what if everyone
    did it?' It's like when you show someone something that has worked well for 50
    years, and they say, 'sure, but now it can't work because I'm sure everyone sees
    it.' Well, if everyone invests by maximizing Sharpe ratios, then we are in the
    CAPM world that creates the positive sloping security market line, but we've been
    telling MBAs to do this for decades to no avail. Considering all the money in
    value and small cap funds, I don't think the modest allocation to low volatility
    has changed things.

    and econ PhDs are common. That's quite different than in my day-to-day field where
    physics and computer science PhDs are more common, where we aren't interested
    in soliciting client money. I'm on the fence as to whether this means financial
    theory is useful for investing large amounts of assets in broad asset classes...or
    that it merely is more helpful in selling one's services to institutions.
