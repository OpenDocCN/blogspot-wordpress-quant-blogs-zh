    topped the *VIX and More* weekly [fear poll](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Fear%20poll).
    [Fears](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/fear) related to excessive
    central bank intervention nudged out concerns related to government and politicians
    as the #2 issue, but perhaps the most interesting development is the how much
    the anxiety related to the [European sovereign debt crisis](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/European%20sovereign%20debt%20crisis)
    continues to subside.'

    low divergence of opinion this week. That being said, whereas U.S. respondents
    cited the fiscal cliff as the top concern, non-U.S. respondents were most concerned
    about excessive central bank intervention in the economy. Perhaps part of the
    fallout from the fiscal cliff negotiations is that U.S. respondents see governments
    and politicians as much more likely to be the top threat to the stock market,
    by a margin of 5.6% over non-U.S. respondents.

    about the euro zone problems, with only 4.9% of U.S. respondents citing euro zones
    as the #1 concern, while 5.9% of non-U.S. respondents put the euro zone issues
    at the top of the list.'

- en: With the [FOMC](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/FOMC) meeting scheduled
    to wind up on Wednesday, the fiscal cliff talks inching closer to that last day
    on which legislation can be introduced in Congress for the year ([December 18^(th)](http://blogs.wsj.com/marketbeat/2012/12/06/fiscal-cliff-looms-closer-than-you-think/),
    based upon a December 21^(st) recess) and Alcoa [scheduled to report Q4 earnings](http://www.alcoa.com/global/en/investment/info_page/financial_calendar.asp)
    and unofficially kick of the next earnings reporting season on January 8^(th),
    there is the potential for quite a few things to hit the fan in the coming month.

    subdued and is still in a position to reinforce the notion that [December Is the
    Cruelest Month…for the VIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2011/12/december-is-cruelest-monthfor-vix.html).
