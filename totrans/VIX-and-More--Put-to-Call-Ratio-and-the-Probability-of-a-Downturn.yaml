- en: In the last day or two I have been fielded several questions about [put to call](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/put%20to%20call)
    ratios. It seems as if some investors are concerned that there is a stealth movement
    by sophisticated investors who are making substantial bets on a downward move
    with large purchases of puts. Invariably, these concerns have led to questions
    about what I see in the put to call ratios that will confirm or deny this.

    as a contrarian signal. The problem with the CPCI data is that institutional order
    flow for index options tends to come in large chunks that can create misleading
    short-term signals.

- en: Recently, however, the CPCE, CPCI and CPC have all had very similar looking
    charts. I have reproduced the six month chart of CPCE below and it shows no unusual
    spikes in put activity relative to call activity. If anything, the 10 day EMA
    that I use to smooth the sometimes noisy CPCE data shows an almost eerie flat
    line for the past month or so, just as was the case when I last wrote about put
    to call ratios when in [Equity Put to Call Ratio Not Pointing to a Correction](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/12/equity-put-to-call-ratio-not-pointing.html)
    when the [Dubai](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Dubai) debt crisis
    hit.
