    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    2002, and 2015\. In those cases, the market bounced, and made a lower low several
    months later. In all cases, stock prices were higher a year later.

    action, and a final  low within 6-8 months. The most recent exception to this
    rule was 2001-2002, when stock prices cratered in the wake of the 9/11 attack,
    but made the final low just over a year later. Arguably, the 2002 low was distorted
    by the 9/11 shock, and the market made a double bottom in 2002 within the space
    of three months.
