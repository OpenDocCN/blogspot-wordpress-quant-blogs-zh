- en: When I started the Microsoft contract to write some GUI-based management tools
    for their new SQL Server, Microsoft and IBM were still putting the finishing touches
    on OS/2 Presentation Manager. So, I started writing the software using an internal
    Microsoft character windowing system called COW .. short for Character-Oriented
    Windows. This was the only user interface system that MS had for OS/2\. (Remember,
    SQL Server started life as an OS/2 product.) COW was used most notably in OS/2's
    LAN Manager. I forgot what the API was like, but I still have all my COW libraries
    and docs on 5 1/4" floppies in a filing cabinet... I just can't bear to part with
    those disks!

    of manuals for SQL Server, OS/2 PM, LAN Manager, OS/2, etc. Thankfully, these
    went into the trash can a few years ago.

    He just got another bump in rank in the most recent corporate restructing at MS.

    is the only way to go! It didn't help that Microsoft was in a big pissing match
    at the time with Sybase.
