    in early 2007, but the truth was, I was just lucky in my timing. We moved back
    to Vancouver and I settled into a daily routine. The first few weeks and months
    were relaxing. I will always be grateful for the last eight years, when my routine
    changed to getting up in the morning to make my daughter breakfast and school
    lunch. Then I would watch the markets (stock market opens at 6:30 am on the west
    coast and closes at 1:00 pm) over the day. Few people who work on Wall Street
    can experience that kind of father-daughter bonding. No amount of money can replace
    being present during that key period of our children`s formative years. I have
    never regretted making the decision to leave Merrill and slow down the pace of
    my life.

    of a team writing an extensive weekend market commentary. The lead analyst (and
    friend) of the team was Mary Ann Bartels. While everyone on Wall Street is hyper-competitive,
    I felt a special responsibility as we were walking in the footsteps of the legendary
    Bob Farrell. Even though our focus was technical analysis, our analysis was technical
    analysis with a quantitative flavor. For example, I pioneered techniques to reverse
    engineer the real-time exposures of hedge funds.

    are some significant problems in doing so. For one thing, most of us can’t find
    someone who trades in a manner that also matches our own strategy, personality
    and goals. This results in inconsistent trading at best as we fight against or
    only selectively follow some recommended trades. And, even if we can find a good
    match, then we often just pick up the same bad habits and faulty process of those
    who we try to copy on top of our own weaknesses. You already have enough weaknesses
    right now that you certainly don’t need to add on top of those you already have.
