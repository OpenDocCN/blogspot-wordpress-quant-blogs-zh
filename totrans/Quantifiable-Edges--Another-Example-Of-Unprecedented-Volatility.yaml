    during extreme periods such as this, traders need to make sure they are comfortable
    executing their plan. Otherwise they could end up as part of the panicked crowd.
    Trading while in a panicked state simply isn’t conducive to optimal decision making.

    may want to place any stops they are planning ahead of the news. Otherwise execution
    may become difficult to impossible.
