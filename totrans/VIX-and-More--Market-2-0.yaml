- en: So far we are 1 ½ hours into Market 2.0 and the picture looks like a throwback
    to earlier in the year. Gold, oil and commodities in general are in the green

    estate logging the largest losses.

    U.S. [sector](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/sectors) performance
    through 11:00 a.m. EDT. If the sector performance looks familiar, it could be
    that the trends bear a strong resemblance to those I recorded back on January
    1^(st) in [Sector Clues in First Hour of 2008?](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/01/sector-clues-in-first-hour-of-2008.html)
