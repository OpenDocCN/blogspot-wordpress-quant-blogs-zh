    based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. In essence, it seeks
    to answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish)

    from China. Indeed, both the Shanghai stock market and the stock indices of China's
    major Asian trading partners all look grim - so grim that every index is in a
    downtrend and trading below its 200 day moving average (dma).

    global growth. In spite of these fears, I am seeing anomalous behavior from the
    cyclical parts of the US stock market. Consider these charts of the relative performance
    of different US sectors and industries below. If the global economy is tanking
    so badly, why are Consumer Discretionary stocks (top panel) on a tear? More curious
    are the relative performance of the cyclically sensitive Industrial and Semiconductors,
    which have rallied out of relative downtrends and appearing to be stabilizing.
    Last but not least, we mustn't forget the DJ Transports, which was the subject
    of much angst as its poor performance sparked a Dow Theory sell signal. As the
    bottom panel shows, the DJTA has turned up and started to outperform the DJIA.
    Do these look like the signs of a recessionary downturn in the US economy?

    with the market bottom indexed at 100 with a 1 standard deviation band around
    the average and the performance so far in 2015\. If we were to discount the possibility
    of a prolonged bear market, this analysis of a choppy market is a reasonable approximate
    roadmap for the current stock market for days and weeks ahead. While this chart
    does show multiple tests of the bottom in the past, bear in mind that there was
    a V-shaped bottom in that sample and in 1998 the market came back and tested support
    only once before rallying again - so don't count on multiple re-tests of the bottom.

    October 2014 lows, which translates to a support and target zone of 1820 to 1860\.
    My inner trader went to cash last week and stepped aside, especially ahead of
    the binary risk posed by the US Employment Report. He is inclined to short into
    strength, but mindful of the fact that a bullish reversal is likely to be at hand
    in the weeks ahead. Given the kind of volatility that we have been seeing, it
    would not be a total surprise to see the market hit the downside support levels
    this week and therefore it pays for traders to stay on their toes and define their
    pain thresholds well ahead of time.
