# gs-collections 4.0 Released | Tales from a Trading Desk

## gs-collections 4.0 Released

Goldman Sachs moves [forwards](https://github.com/goldmansachs/gs-collections/releases) with gs-collections 4.0.  Code Kata offers [training](https://github.com/goldmansachs/gs-collections-kata) and excercises on gs-collections.  A rather old slide deck offers an intro [here](http://www.goldmansachs.com/gs-collections/documents/GS%20Collections%20Training%20Session%20and%20Kata%202.0.0.pdf). Inspired by Smalltalk Collection protocol 🙂  Wonder if the Deutsche Bank [*Lodestone*](http://news.efinancialcareers.com/116832/deutsche-is-inviting-nocturnal-it-professionals-who-work-from-their-spare-rooms-to-join-its-new-community/) had anything to do with GS’s Open Sourcing? I notice as well that the Lodestone WordPress [blog](http://lodestonefoundation.wordpress.com/) is now marked as private
