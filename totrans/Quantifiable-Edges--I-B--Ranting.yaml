    its pullback today. I am not a participant in the pullback, but rather an observer.
    While the overbought readings indicated there would likely be one soon, my studies
    indicated risk/reward was unfavorable in trying to short it.

- en: As far as I’m concerned the action during this pullback becomes very important.
    I demonstrated last week that the first several days following a Follow Through
    Day are a pretty good predictor of success or failure. After 2 days we are still
    holding up. I’ll continue to monitor the action carefully.

    Through Day. IBD apparently failed to label it one. In Friday’s Big Picture column
    they wrote:'

    gains than Thursday''s to signal a fundamental shift in the market''s trend.'

    did manage to assemble a follow-through session of powerful gains in heavier volume.
    The reason? There are virtually no stocks close to proper buying positions right
    now.”*

- en: From my perspective, Thursday satisfied the requirements IBD previously laid
    out for Follow Through Days. Due to their perception of volatility and breadth
    they remain negative on the market's prospects. As they should, they are deriving
    their outlook from multiple readings of market health. Unfortunately it seems
    they would like to advertise the Follow Through Day as a magic indicator that
    never fails. Therefore, either they make excuses or change the definition of it
    so that it appears not to fail. Should this rally take hold I have no doubt they
    will refer to last Thursday as a Follow Through Day in a future publication. It
    is a tool that uses volume and price action. Breadth, while important, is a separate
    matter.

    important is whether they can be utilized as an effective tool for helping to
    identify market bottoms. So far we’ve seen that they have been about 55% accurate
    and risk outweighs reward. (

    recent market conditions destroys much of that utility in my eyes.

    Should the McClellans decide to constantly adjust the way it should be calculated,
    it would fail to be as useful.

- en: The Follow Through Day study I laid out and have been discussing the last few
    weeks has identified Thursday as a Follow Through Day based on the original definition
    offered by William O’Neil. For purposes of my study and my trading it shall remain
    one whether it works or not.
