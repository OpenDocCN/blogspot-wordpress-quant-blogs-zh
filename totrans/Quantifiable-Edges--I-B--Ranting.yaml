- en: After persistently running higher for almost two weeks, the market finally began
    its pullback today. I am not a participant in the pullback, but rather an observer.
    While the overbought readings indicated there would likely be one soon, my studies
    indicated risk/reward was unfavorable in trying to short it.

- en: As far as I’m concerned the action during this pullback becomes very important.
    I demonstrated last week that the first several days following a Follow Through
    Day are a pretty good predictor of success or failure. After 2 days we are still
    holding up. I’ll continue to monitor the action carefully.

  zh: 提出的一个问题是，上周四实际上是跟进行为的日子吗？IBD似乎没有给它贴上标签。在周五的大图专栏中，他们写道：

    gains than Thursday''s to signal a fundamental shift in the market''s trend.'

    did manage to assemble a follow-through session of powerful gains in heavier volume.
    The reason? There are virtually no stocks close to proper buying positions right
    now.”*

- en: From my perspective, Thursday satisfied the requirements IBD previously laid
    out for Follow Through Days. Due to their perception of volatility and breadth
    they remain negative on the market's prospects. As they should, they are deriving
    their outlook from multiple readings of market health. Unfortunately it seems
    they would like to advertise the Follow Through Day as a magic indicator that
    never fails. Therefore, either they make excuses or change the definition of it
    so that it appears not to fail. Should this rally take hold I have no doubt they
    will refer to last Thursday as a Follow Through Day in a future publication. It
    is a tool that uses volume and price action. Breadth, while important, is a separate
    matter.

  zh: 从我的角度来看，周四满足了IBD之前为跟进行为的日子设定的要求。由于他们对市场波动和广度的看法，他们仍然对市场前景持负面看法。正如他们应该做的那样，他们从市场健康的多个读数中得出他们的观点。不幸的是，他们似乎想将跟进行为的日子宣传为一种永远不会失败的神奇指标。因此，要么他们找借口，要么改变其定义，使其看起来不会失败。如果这次反弹能够站稳，我毫不怀疑他们会在未来的出版物中把上周四称为跟进行为的日子。这是一个使用成交量和价格行动的工具。虽然广度很重要，但这是一个
    separate matter。
- en: Whether Follow Through Days always work is not important to traders. What is
    important is whether they can be utilized as an effective tool for helping to
    identify market bottoms. So far we’ve seen that they have been about 55% accurate
    and risk outweighs reward. (
