    techniques, etc.    I am a quant / developer, now trader, living in the New York
    area, just back from the UK, where I headed an algo pricing & strategies team.

    to join Wall Street.   My area of study was parallel computing and physics.  
    I got involved with Lehman Brothers in 1992 as they had a joint research group
    with American Express researching Neural Nets, VR, Parallel Processing, and Voice
    Recognition.   I joined the Parallel Processing group as a consultant.

    as:  a prepayment model for CMOs and later HJM for exotic path dependent interest
    rate models.   Gradually was pulled into the business.   I went to Tokyo in 1994
    with Lehman and was thrown in the deep end of the pool to learn the IR derivatives
    business.

    wall street was still nascent / bleading-edge.   Things changed gradually, I tired
    of it, and left the street to pursue other interests — for a while.

    to do this with a firm in 2004\.   I love the fact that it pulls the best of mathematics,
    computer science, market knowledge, and creativity into one package.   Thus it
    has been my focus for the last 10 years — now a career.
