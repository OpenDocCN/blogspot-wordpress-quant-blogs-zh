    gaps and selling rallies have worked well recently for traders and in the morning

    finding a long entry to ride the afternoon market into the close. Buying into
    large gaps during downtrends provides traders a quantifiable edge. This is true

    index exposure as well. I was looking for one of two things to happen before taking
    any more long index exposure: 1) A washout day to the downside. 2) An up close
    or reversal day.'

    one-day move. So the question now becomes, has the move come too far to chase
    at this point? It is better to wait for a lower entry point?

    I looked at all instances where the S&P closed at a 100-day low and then exploded
    up 3.5% or more the next day. Looking back to 1962 I found 9 other instances Below

- en: The above analysis combined with the fact that the CBI remains high indicates
    to me there’s still some juice left in this rally. It also appears likely the
    market will look to digest these gains over the next 1-3 days and traders looking
    for short-term gains may be able to get a better entry point.
