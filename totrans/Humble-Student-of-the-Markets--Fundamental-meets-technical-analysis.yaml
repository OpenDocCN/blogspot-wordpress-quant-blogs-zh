    points that the rest of the market hasn’t really focused on. So it is with great
    interest that Jeff Matthews, who often has good fundamental insights, indicated
    that the economy may be improving or poised to improve because of

    that stretches from a candy maker in South San Francisco to a high-tech machine
    tooling supplier in Israel, we think it’s no wonder Warren Buffett decided the
    time was right to buy the rest of Burlington Northern.

    may be correct in their analysis but they can get their timing wrong. So is Jeff

    Dow Jones Transportation Average relative to the Dow Jones Industrials Average.
    As you can see from the chart, the Transports show no sign of life on a relative
    basis and could be argued that it is in a minor downtrend.

    would be out of character for him. As for Matthews' call for a growth surprise,
    I prefer to wait for some confirmation that market perception has turned before
    hopping on board his *train*.
