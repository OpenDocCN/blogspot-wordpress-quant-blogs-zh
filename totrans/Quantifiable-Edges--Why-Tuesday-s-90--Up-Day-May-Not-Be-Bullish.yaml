    those who are unaware a 90% day is a day where volume and points are 90% one directional.
    A 90% up day would occur when 90% of the volume traded and points traded on the
    NYSE are to the upside.

    a bottom. (You can find a free copy of their report

    lead to market weakness. For the below study I ignored the points qualification
    and just looked for 90% up volume days.

    while the test went back to 1970, 6 of the 8 instances found have occurred in
    the last 2 years. Prior to that it was unusual for a 90% day to occur directly
    following a low.
