    underlying currency cross-rates are often stationary as well. Now, there are several
    advantages in trading currency cross rates instead of ETF pairs. When trading
    a stationary cross rate, you can enter a limit order to enter and exit, but trading
    pairs of ETF's involve market orders on at least one side. Also, ETF's can sometimes
    be hard-to-borrow, and their margin requirements are much more onerous than that
    of currencies. However, the one major disadvantage in trading cross rates is that
    they are not always available on your brokerage. For example, based on the cointegration
    of EWA and EZA you would think that trading AUDZAR would be quite profitable.
    And you would be right,

    you know of a good Forex brokerage that have many emerging markets cross-rates
    for trading, especially those of Latin American countries, please let the rest
    of us know!'
