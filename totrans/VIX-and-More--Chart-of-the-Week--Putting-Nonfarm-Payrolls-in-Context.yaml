    the next person to hear that Friday’s [nonfarm payrolls](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/nonfarm%20payrolls)
    were ~~better~~ not as bad as had been expected.

    half of the job losses suffered in each month from November through April.

    just over two months ago: [Chart of the Week: Nonfarm Payrolls, Unemployment Rates
    and Time](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/06/chart-of-week-nonfarm-payrolls.html).
    In that post and accompanying chart, I stressed that following the peak job losses
    of 325,000 in October 2001, it was 19 months before there was a sustained improvement
    in the [unemployment rate](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/unemployment%20rate)
    and a full 3 ½ years before the unemployment rate was below the October 2001 rate
    on a sustained basis.'

    and highlights another important point about the monthly job report. In the last
    recession, it was two full years from peak job losses to three months of consecutive
    net job gains. Further, while the 247,000 job losses sounds like considerable
    progress in the context of the recent job situation, July would have been the
    third worst month for job losses during the 2000-2003 bear market.

    we are a long way from the type of data that should be a cause for celebration.
