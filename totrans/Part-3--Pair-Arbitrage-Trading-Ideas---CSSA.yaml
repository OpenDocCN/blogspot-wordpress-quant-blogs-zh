    you all certain concepts—-some new, some old for pair trading and arbitrage. I
    will lengthen out this discussion to at least one other blog because there are
    so many ideas and nuances worth discussing.

    when figuring out how to go about extracting profit in “pairworld.” It is also
    important to think about this type of trading as much more of a high stakes poker
    game, where you have to know your opponents, and how they play in order to fully
    take advantage of all the opportunities that exist (more on this in later posts).

    1) Pure arbitrage: this doesn’t actually exist– even if you replicate the holdings
    of an etf continously and short or buy the ETF, there is no guarantee that you
    will realize a profit, as the market of buyers and sellers for the ETF are much
    larger than most individual traders and funds. 2) Near arbitrage: this is when
    we trade virtual substitutes–whether it is a leveraged ETF vs its unleveraged
    counterpart, or two nearly identical sector, style,or country ETFs. 3) Near substitutes:
    this is when there are distinct but slight differences between two sides of the
    pair—such as DBC vs GSG, where they are both commodity indexes with different
    weighting schemes that are still highly similar. Or it could be IYR–the real estate
    sector–vs VNQ– the REIT ETF. The other possibility is that you can synthetically
    create near substitutes (my favorite and very lucrative), such as trading the
    ten largest holdings in an ETF vs the ETF itself which may contain 30-50 stocks.
    This category also includes futures spreads such as USO (oil) vs USL (12-month
    oil) 4) Cross Pairs: this is where you have highly related pairs that are definitely
    different but are cointegrated by virtue of the fact that they are driven by similar
    macroeconomic factors–such as XLE–the energy sector vs USO, XAU the gold and silver
    equity index vs gold. In addition, cross pairs can also be spuriously related
    through a third party, such as the Canadian dollar- FXC vs the aussie dollar–FXA,
    which are both affected heavily by commodity prices.'

    form of leveraged ETFs. This is a topic i could write an entire book on, but just
    think of leveraged ETFs like Lego—you can really get creative and build immensely
    intricate and complicated strategies one brick at a time. There are 2x and 3x
    both long and short, as well as inverse ETFs covering identical sectors, industries
    or countries—sometimes even with multiple providers. As long as you can do some
    basic math, you are ready to get your hands dirty. The financial sector is a good
    example: there are 3 underlying unleveraged ETFs that are good to trade here vs
    their leveraged counterparts :IYF, XLF, and VFH. These can be traded against one
    another as a standalone strategy. In addition, you can short or go long these
    ETFs vs their 2x or 3x counterparts by simply using the requisite multiple (2x
    or 3x) of the dollar value purchased in the leveraged vehicle.'

    strategy.” This is applicable to virtually all pair strategies without having
    to use any indicators at all. Basic strategy entails creating a baseline value
    measure of discrepancy which is scaled so that you can compare all of the different
    Lego blocks. As an example, you would look at the current % change for the day
    for say the XLF as your baseline, and then compare it appropriately to every leveraged
    counterpart, and near arbitrage or substitute. So if XLF is UP 2% today, we should
    expect UYG (2x long financials) to be up 4% (2×2—told you it was easy!). SKF (2x
    short financials) should be down 4%, VNF and IYF should be up 2%, FAZ (3x short
    financials) should be down 6%, FAS (3x short financials) should be up 6%, and
    SEF (the inverse or single short financials) should be down 2%.

- en: From here the goal is to find the biggest “D” or discrepancy between the baseline
    and one of the related ETFs. “D” is basically a measure of how overvalued or undervalued
    on of the components is relative to the baseline. So in the above example, if
    SKF was down %5 instead of 4%, it would have a “D” of -1% or undervalued by 1%.
    The goal would be to get long SKF and balance it off with an offsetting long position–ideally
    something that is overvalued. This brings up tremendous opportunities to combine
    different positions to maximize profit. Squeezing out an extra .2% by taking an
    unconventional position can cover the fixed transaction costs making lower margin
    trades that would be passed on by the less saavy who believe them to be breakeven
    trades.
