    analysis, or conducting "sanity checks" on models and understanding the limits
    of the models that quants use. If you are in the New York area on September 6,
    I would wholehearted recommend the NYSSA author series with Emanuel Derman, one
    of the giants in the quant industry:'

- en: Why do we—bankers in particular—continue to put so much faith in financial models,
    when time and again they have failed, in some cases with catastrophic effects
    on the economy? Author and former quantitative analyst Emanuel Derman will discuss
    why it is a terrible mistake to trust models. Though financial models imitate
    the style of physics and employ the language of mathematics, they ultimately deal
    with human beings. This is problematic because models in physics aim for a description
    of reality while economists’ equations are limited in that area. The author will
    also discuss what a model is, and then highlight the differences between the successes
    of modeling in physics and its failures in economics. He will also cover the collapse
    of the subprime mortgage CDO market in 2007, urge us to stop a naïve reliance
    on these models, and offer suggestions for mending them.
