    to be consistent with a preference towards really high positive tail returns (eg,
    lottery tickets), you have risk premiums of trivial absolute amounts to this tail
    risk, around one-tenth the equity risk premium. You can get the signs to go the
    right way, but then you can't get the relative magnitudes right.

    to play parochial status games and browbeat outsiders as to the very rigorous
    foundations of their opinions. I doubt a single financial economist who likes
    the skew rationale for anomalies cares about this inconsistency as it is rarely
    cited; 'complete' models always applied piecemeal.

    just lower your equity position. If you are long the VXX, fine, but you should
    expect the return on that to be positive because it's a crappy pure hedge.
