## Taleb at the RSA

### May 1, 2007

Just got back from seeing [Taleb](http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com) speak at the [RSA](http://www.rsa.org.uk). I didn’t stay at the after talk drinks, being too tired from a very early start today. He’s not the most fluent public speaker, but he’s witty and charming, and the anecdotage is good. I scribbled some notes as he spoke…

*   Evolution has wired us for “Mediocristan”: sequences of events that show relatively little variance. Example: out of 1000 people what proportion of the total weight is the heaviest man in the world ? Maybe 0.5%…
*   But we live in a world constructed largely by ourselves, with events that show very high variance. Example: out of a 1000 people what proportion of the total wealth is the richest man in the world ? 99%. That’s “Extremistan”…
*   We produce theories or narratives to explain events instinctively, and they blind us to the true nature of events, because those explanations are geared for Mediocristan.
*   In some domains we can spot incompetence immediately: pilots, chefs, taxi drivers, dentists. In others it’s much harder: CEOs, traders, prime ministers.
*   Volatility isn’t bad per se. What’s important is robustness. Italian govt is volatile but robust. Saudi govt is not volatile, but the regime is not robust.
