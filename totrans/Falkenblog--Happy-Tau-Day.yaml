- en: One of the more tragic path dependencies is that years ago someone defined *π*
    (aka pi) as ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, as opposed
    to its radius. If you define *τ*(tau)*=2π*, it's like a presbyopic putting on
    reading glasses for the first time. It turns out, switching from *π* to *τ* makes
    a lot of other corollaries less convoluted, including the 'world's most beautiful
    formula' *e^(iπ)=-1*, which would be *e^(iτ)=1*.
