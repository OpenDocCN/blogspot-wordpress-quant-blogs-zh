# VIX and More: One Reason Why Volatility May Have Bottomed

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/05/one-reason-why-volatility-may-have.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/05/one-reason-why-volatility-may-have.html#0001-01-01)

The graphic below says it all – and the official beginning of [hurricane](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/hurricanes) season is two weeks from Sunday.

Given the supply issues with oil and natural gas, even the threat of a hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico is sure to cause considerable consternation.  Of course, with all the global warming, [this year’s prediction](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/04/080409133718.htm) from the folks at Colorado State University is not particularly soothing:

*"Based on our latest forecast, the probability of a major hurricane making landfall along the U.S. coastline is 69 percent compared with the last-century average of 52 percent," said Phil Klotzbach of the Colorado State hurricane forecast team. "We are calling for a very active hurricane season this year, but not as active as the 2004 and 2005 seasons."*

I’ll have more to say on weather and volatility as we get deeper into the hurricane season.
