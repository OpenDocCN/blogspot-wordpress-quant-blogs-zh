    XAU, both gold stock indices have been lagging the price of bullion in the past
    few years. More importantly, gold stocks have not shown the same upside potential
    as they have in the past relative to gold.

    of the senior miners were in the $200-250 range, gold stocks were in effect call
    options on gold with a strike price in the $200-250 area. As gold prices rose,
    gold equities became deep in the money options and their leverage to gold declined.
    Speculators who wanted to play the rise in the gold price lost interest, especially
    with the introduction of very liquid gold ETFs around the world.

    improve. I created a synthetic gold stock by building a model based on these principles.
