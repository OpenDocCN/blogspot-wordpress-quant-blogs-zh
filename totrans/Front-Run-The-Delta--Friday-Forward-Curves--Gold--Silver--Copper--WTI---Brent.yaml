    using ... it looks like a custom Excel spreadsheet with RTD plugins for real time
    data?

    of the curve moves?

    Workstation. I've been very impressed w/ the system's flexibility and reach.

    because the visual rep is just the last trade, which can be stale and potentially
    misleading. Note the trade times, the last trade, and the live bid/ask. Liquidity
    risk rests on the axiom that the live bid/ask is the only thing that matters.
