    persistent overpricing of Chinese Warrants.

- en: ', all Chinese academics, examined looked at 47 warrants traded on the Shanghai
    or Shenzhen exchanges, from 2005-2008\.  The implied volatilities are about 3
    times the historical in their dataset; 150% average implied vs. a 50% average
    historical volatility.'

- en: Above is an anecdote of how the market price tracks a Black-Scholes price given
    historical volatility as opposed to the market price (blue is market price, magenta
    is the model price). It's basically impossible to tell a rational story for the
    market price.

- en: These warrants were all basically options, as they allow continuous creation
    which allows issuers or other approved institutions to add to supply at at time.
     As warrants cash settle every day, they make for a popular investment, often
    with volume far exceeding the underlying equity.

    China is as a long term investment. I mean, they are doing a lot of things right,
    but their institutions aren't exactly promoting rational price discovery. It also
    highlights that preventing shorting is one of the stupider regulations in the
    world, because without shorts, stupid prices persist a lot longer.
