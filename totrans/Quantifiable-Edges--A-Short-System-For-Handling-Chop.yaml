    prone to chop and less prone to follow-through. Tonight I will show an incredibly
    simple system that would have fared exceptionally well over this time period.
    I’ll then discuss the possible value of such a system.

    200ma, then there will be 43 trades – 41 (95%) of which were profitable.

    a great system. In fact, if you run performance back to 1960, it’s not even a
    winning system.

    I’m sure traders could come up with a more profitable exit strategy – even if
    it meant suffering a few more losing trades.

    last 15 months. Once aware of this, traders should look to take advantage. Seeing
    the market move in one direction for even a couple of days should alert traders
    that they may want to take profits or consider a strategy to benefit from a swing
    in the opposite direction.

    be a great “trading” system, it does appear to be a very useful “tracking” system.
    In other words, moves higher of 2 days or more have quickly reversed and provided
    the system a nice string of winning trades. Traders should be on alert for system
    failures, as they could be a sign that selling into up-moves may be falling out
    of favor and the market environment changing. Therefore they would need to adjust
    their approach to take advantage of the new, emerging environment.
