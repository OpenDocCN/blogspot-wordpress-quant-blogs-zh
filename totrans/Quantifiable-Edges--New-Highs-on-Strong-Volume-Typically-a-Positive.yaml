    I examined in last night’s Letter. One filter I’ve found helpful in the past is
    excluding op-ex Fridays since they will so often post extremely high volume. Below
    is a stats table from my examination.

- en: I will note that there are a number of short-term studies pointing south right
    now. These include studies related to SPY patterns, VIX movement, and seasonality.
    So immediate upside follow through is very much in question despite what’s shown
    above. But if I see more bullish evidence emerge over the next few days this study
    could provide a nice start in building a bullish outlook.
