    Price at [The price of everything](http://thepriceofeverything.typepad.com/) has
    an excellent post up today with the title, “[It’s About Time](http://thepriceofeverything.typepad.com/the_price_of_everything/2007/04/its_about_time.html)...”  In
    it, he quotes Jim Leitner of Falcon Management as saying (in [Inside the House
    of Money: Top Hedge Fund Managers on Profiting in the Global Markets](http://www.amazon.com/Inside-House-Money-Traders-Profiting/dp/0471794473))
    that “If all investors allocate money to a one-month time frame, by definition
    there are going to be fewer opportunities there...There’s just too much competition
    over short-term trading, which is a timing-driven business. With timing, sometimes
    you’re going to be right and sometimes you’re going to be wrong, but it’s not
    going to be consistent over time. Meanwhile, the longer-term opportunities still
    exist because there hasn’t been that much money allocated with multi-year lockups.
    That’s not happening yet and probably won’t because investors are way too nervous
    and shortsighted.”'

- en: I talked a little about [time horizons](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/time%20horizon)
    in [A Sentiment Primer](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/03/sentiment-primer-long.html),
    and will have more to say on the subject at a later date, but I today want to
    note that I don’t believe Leitner picked the one month time frame for his hypothetical
    out of thin air.  Given that the SPX is a real-time pricing measure, the VIX looks
    out 30 days, and VIX options extend all the way out to the middle of 2008, this
    presents an interesting context in which to think about risk and reward.

    (whose [Fooled by Randomness](http://www.amazon.com/Fooled-Randomness-Hidden-Chance-Markets/dp/1587990717)
    is required reading for all VIXophiles) as the source for the statistic that the
    day trader’s portfolio has a 50.17% chance of improving for each minute that the
    frenetic trader checks the balance, while the long-term investor who checks his
    or her portfolio once a month is likely to see a gain in the period 67% of the
    time.

    good are you at matching your research, thinking, setups, entries and management
    of existing positions to your target time horizon?  Do you know the time horizon
    of your favorite indicators?  Do they suit your trading style and typical holding
    periods?

    them as a thought experiment.  I will kick them around a little more and weigh
    in again at some time in the future.
