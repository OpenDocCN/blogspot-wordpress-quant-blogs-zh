    Price at [The price of everything](http://thepriceofeverything.typepad.com/) has
    an excellent post up today with the title, “[It’s About Time](http://thepriceofeverything.typepad.com/the_price_of_everything/2007/04/its_about_time.html)...”  In
    it, he quotes Jim Leitner of Falcon Management as saying (in [Inside the House
    of Money: Top Hedge Fund Managers on Profiting in the Global Markets](http://www.amazon.com/Inside-House-Money-Traders-Profiting/dp/0471794473))
    that “If all investors allocate money to a one-month time frame, by definition
    there are going to be fewer opportunities there...There’s just too much competition
    over short-term trading, which is a timing-driven business. With timing, sometimes
    you’re going to be right and sometimes you’re going to be wrong, but it’s not
    going to be consistent over time. Meanwhile, the longer-term opportunities still
    exist because there hasn’t been that much money allocated with multi-year lockups.
    That’s not happening yet and probably won’t because investors are way too nervous
    and shortsighted.”'

    Price在[The price of everything](http://thepriceofeverything.typepad.com/)上发表了一篇题为“[It’s
    About Time](http://thepriceofeverything.typepad.com/the_price_of_everything/2007/04/its_about_time.html)...”的优秀文章。在其中，他引用了Falcon
    Management的Jim Leitner的话（出自[Inside the House of Money: Top Hedge Fund Managers
    on Profiting in the Global Markets](http://www.amazon.com/Inside-House-Money-Traders-Profiting/dp/0471794473)），他说：“如果所有投资者都将资金分配到一个一个月的时间框架内，那么根据定义，那里会
    fewer opportunities...在短期交易中，竞争过于激烈，这是一个时机驱动的业务。在时机上，有时你会正确，有时你会错误，但随着时间的推移，它不会保持一致。与此同时，较长期的机会仍然存在，因为还没有那么多的资金分配到多年度锁定。这还没有发生，可能也不会发生，因为投资者过于紧张和短视。”'
- en: I talked a little about [time horizons](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/time%20horizon)
    in [A Sentiment Primer](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/03/sentiment-primer-long.html),
    and will have more to say on the subject at a later date, but I today want to
    note that I don’t believe Leitner picked the one month time frame for his hypothetical
    out of thin air.  Given that the SPX is a real-time pricing measure, the VIX looks
    out 30 days, and VIX options extend all the way out to the middle of 2008, this
    presents an interesting context in which to think about risk and reward.

  zh: 我在[A Sentiment Primer](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/03/sentiment-primer-long.html)中稍微提到了[时间跨度](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/time%20horizon)，稍后再详细讨论这个问题，但今天我想指出，我不认为Leitner选择一个月的时间框架是出于偶然。考虑到SPX是一个实时定价指标，VIX展望30天，VIX期权一直延伸到2008年年中，这为思考风险和回报提供了一个有趣的背景。

    (whose [Fooled by Randomness](http://www.amazon.com/Fooled-Randomness-Hidden-Chance-Markets/dp/1587990717)
    is required reading for all VIXophiles) as the source for the statistic that the
    day trader’s portfolio has a 50.17% chance of improving for each minute that the
    frenetic trader checks the balance, while the long-term investor who checks his
    or her portfolio once a month is likely to see a gain in the period 67% of the
    time.
