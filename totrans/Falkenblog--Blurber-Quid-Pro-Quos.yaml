- en: After the dot-com bubble, people were shocked to find that Investment Banks
    often promoted stocks to their clients while simultaneously seeking business from
    these companies, often in a quid-pro-quo. Analysts such as Henry Blodget of Merrill
    Lynch, Jack Grubman of Citi, Mary Meeker of Morgan Stanley, and Frank Quattrone
    of Credit Suisse First Boston were considered perspicacious gurus of the 'new
    economy' back in 2000 (Meeker still works as an analyst!). In fact, they were
    in indiscriminate shills for their corporate bankers, who would reap big fees
    on new equity or debt issues. Their signal-to-noise ratio was actually negative.
    But they wrote in a way readers appreciated, so like giving whiskey to Indians,
    they could merely say they were filling a need.

    a separation between research and investment banking, and a prohibition against
    analyst compensation based on investment banking business.

    the blurbs, and find them often transparently compromised. That is, 90% of the

    interested in the positive fortunes of the author and the book. For example, Tyler
    Cowen has a new book coming out, and he referenced two rather glowing reviews,

    each other is sincere, after all praise to those who have done, or may do, a great
    favor for you comes naturally. But back in the 1990's every stock analyst would
    regularly insist that their recommendations came from bottom-up due diligence
    and an uncompromising evalution of the big picture. It is what economists call
    'cheap talk', because it costs nothing in reputation, money, or cognitive dissonance,
    to insincerely say one is sincere, making the declaration meaningless.

    If you have never read at least two negative reviews from someone, you should
    dismiss their positive reviews. Richard Posner and Bob Solow are good reviewers,

    subject to the same whithering criticism given to, say, bureaucrats, various academics,
    or those not advertising on his site. This same well-known quant is outraged that
    ratings agencies have a conflict of interest with those they rate, and probably
    thinks his situation is different. As they say, it's good to be reasonable, because
    then you can come up with a reason for everything you do.

    giving tendentious support for those doing them favors. It's my responsibility
    to evaluate everything, including evaluations of third party evaluators.
