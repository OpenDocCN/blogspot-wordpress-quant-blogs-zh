    PutWrite Index ([PUT](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/PUT)), a recipient
    of the [Most Innovative Benchmark Index award](http://www.cboe.com/AboutCBOE/ShowDocument.aspx?DIR=ACNews&FILE=cboe_20071204.doc)
    at last year’s Super Bowl of Indexing Conference.

    a put writing strategy is probably not top of mind for most investors at the moment.
    In fact, a [put write](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/put-write)
    strategy like one tracked by the PutWrite Index will generally outperform the
    S&P 500 index in a down trending market and significantly outperform the S&P 500
    index in a sideways market. Much like a covered call strategy, however, a put
    write approach will not match the gains of the underlying index in a strong bull
    market rally.

    S&P 500 Index puts and invest cash at one- and three-month Treasury Bill rates.
    The number of puts sold varies from month to month, but is limited so that the
    amount held in Treasury Bills can finance the maximum possible loss from final
    settlement of the SPX puts.”*'

    sense of the essence of put write strategies. Those who expect the markets to
    do anything other than rally significantly might also want to start implementing
    that strategy on their own.
