    from iShares description of [iShares S&P National AMT-free Municipal Bond Fund
    (MUB)](http://us.ishares.com/product_info/fund/overview/MUB.htm?fundSearch=true&qt=MUB),
    it appears that the press and investors just don’t understand one of the most
    important basics of fixed income—duration.

    "The Standard Deviation is the statistical measure of the degree to which an individual
    value in a probability distribution tends to vary from the mean of the distribution.  It
    is widely applied in modern portfolio theory, where the past performance of securities
    is used to determine the range of possible future performance, and a probability
    is attached to each performance.")

- en: Duration tells you the expected price change from a move in interest rates,
    so in the case of MUB with effective duration of 7.61, MUB should lose in price
    7.61% for every 1% move up in interest rates.  7.61 duration (equivalent to a
    7-10 Year Treasury) is what I would consider very interest rate sensitive and
    much more susceptible than the Barclays Aggregate at 4.98.

    all that strange or unusual compared to the iShares 7-10 US Treasury (IEF).  So
    far, it just appears to be a bounded random blip that has already corrected itself.

    that is the danger of leverage.

    The same thing is happening in the Investment Grade Corporate Index at a near-record
    duration (LQD is 7.01), so be very careful there too.
