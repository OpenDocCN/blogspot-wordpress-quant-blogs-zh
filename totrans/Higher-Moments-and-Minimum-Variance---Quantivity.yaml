    model: more volatility translates into more returns. However, as skewness increases
    and becomes positive, the positive relation between volatility and returns turns
    into a negative relation. For stocks with positive skewness, higher volatility
    means lower returns. Even more, the lowest returns are earned by the portfolio
    with stocks that have high positive skewness and high volatility.'

    but stocks with high skewness are compensated with high returns when volatility
    decreases. This compensation for volatility presents somewhat of a puzzle given
    that, under the mean-variance model, investors always prefer low volatility and
    not high volatility as implied by our result. Hence, we argue that investors accept
    low returns and high volatility only because they are more attracted to high positive
    skewness; they are skewness lovers or lotto investors.

    this article nicely extends the intuition motivating minimum variance optimization
    into higher moments.
