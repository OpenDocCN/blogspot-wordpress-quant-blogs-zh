    marks the third anniversary of the launch of this newsletter, which was launched
    on the heels of the demise of Bear Stearns amidst increasing concerns about the
    stability of the financial system and increasing market volatility.

    a more detailed discussion of geopolitical and macroeconomic events than can be
    found here as well as some broader perspective on the full range of asset classes
    and issues related to volatility.
