    for having a bearish bias in the face of a bull stampede. At the time, I was ready
    to close out most of my short positions, but this decision was conditional on
    how the market closed. As it turns out, the bearish momentum at the close was
    enough for me to leave my short positions on.

    and at least one lower high to follow before thinking about establishing short
    positions. There is, however, a case to be made for anticipating some market reversals
    and the current situation has three important ingredients: resistance; declining
    momentum; and a large magnitude move that is ripe for reversal.'

    lines in blue that utilize the late September post-Lehman highs as their starting
    point. The key post-Lehman Fibonacci resistance is 966 in the SPX, which represents
    halfway between the 1265 high and 666 low. In terms of declining momentum, in
    addition to the obvious recent range-bound trading, the Average Directional Indicator
    ([ADX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/ADX)) shows trend strength
    (black line in bottom portion of graph) stalling below the 25 level, which signals
    a weak trend. Further, the positive directional indicator (+DI, green line) is
    showing an even more rapid loss of positive momentum. Finally, the move from 666
    to 956 was a little over 43% and was accomplished in the absence of any meaningful
    pullback along the way. In other words, this is a large move that is ripe for
    a retracement.

    bear case, but this is an outline of the basic premise.

    demonstrate an ability to gain some traction, I will add to that position quickly.

    more bullish posture.
