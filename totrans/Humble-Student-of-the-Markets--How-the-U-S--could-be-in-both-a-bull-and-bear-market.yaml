    200 dma as it could have been the signal of a major bearish episode.

- en: Technical analysts offered some relief when they pointed out that it’s the slope
    of the 200 dma that matters. The historical evidence shows violations of the 200
    dma when the moving average is just a correction in an uptrend. However, an index
    that’s trading below a falling 200 dma is a warning flag that a bear market is
    under way. The arrows in the accompanying chart show the occasions when the S&P
    500 fell below a falling 200 dma. Often these signals occurred when the index
    violated a rising moving average, which later turned down, marked by the red arrows.

    last week. This episode is a lesson for investors to regard similar circumstances
    as a buying opportunity. But that’s not the entire story as the market is becoming
    increasingly bifurcated.

- en: This chart shows the S&P 500, NASDAQ 100, Dow Jones Industrials Average, the
    mid-cap S&P 400 and the small-cap Russell 2000 with their respective moving averages.
    The good news is the S&P 500 and the Dow regained their 200 dma. While the S&P
    500 moving average has been rising, the same isn’t true for the Dow. The NASDAQ
    100 is holding above its 200 dma. The bad news is the S&P 400 and the Russell
    2000 are below falling moving averages. The strength of the S&P 500 has been held
    up by megcap growth stocks. In the absence of the effects of megcap growth, the
    other major U.S. equity averages are signaling bear markets.

    on your time horizon and whether you are a momentum or value investor.
