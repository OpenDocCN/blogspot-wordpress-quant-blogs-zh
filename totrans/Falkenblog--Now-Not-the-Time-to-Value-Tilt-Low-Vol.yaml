    valuation metrics.  Three different types of low vol portfolios are seemingly
    higher priced using two different value metrics, book/market and earnings yield.
     That is, low vol portfolios over the past 10 years used to have higher earnings
    yields than the market, and higher book/market ratios; now it's the reverse.

    ratio moving from 0.3 to 0.6 is about moving from the 15th percentile to the 45th
    percentile.  Li suggests adding a valuation criteria to low volatility to counteract
    this value-creep. The basic idea is, say the book/market ratio has a linear relation
    with expected return, where a higher book/market is associated with a higher return.
     So if we take the universe of a set of low vol stocks, say the constituents of
    the ETF SPLV, which looks a the 100 least volatile stocks of the past year, and
    then take those stocks with the highest book/market ratios within that set, we
    simultaneously capture more of the value effect

    is not linear.  Therefore, merely moving your average book/market ratio may may
    you feel better, but unless you pick the right stocks, you won't change much.
     Here's the average return by book/market deciles, for those stocks above the
    20th percentile of the NYSE (all data here are from Ken French's excellent

    we are looking at geometric returns, that sharp increase for the top decile isn't
    there, but forget that for now (I think the geometric average is more relevant
    given that in practice people don't rebalance monthly, but to each his own).  The
    key is, this relationship over the investable universe is basically all happening
    at the end-deciles, not in between.  Thus, average book/market decile can be misleading,
    because not much happens between the 30th and 90th percentiles.

    other strategies, it's not obviously beneficial, and most low vol practitioners
    are doing this, so you really aren't thinking outside the box.
