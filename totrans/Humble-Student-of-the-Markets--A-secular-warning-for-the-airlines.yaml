    small cap analyst early in my career. However, since Mrs. Humble Student of the
    Markets is a pilot and has numerous contacts in the aviation industry I thought
    I would make an exception.

- en: There seems to be a dearth of flight instructors in North America, largely because
    of the low paying nature of the job. Recently, Mrs. Humble Student of the Markets
    was involved in a feasibility study to bring students from China to Canada to
    be trained as pilots. To make a long story short, she found that there was little
    spare educational capacity at Canadian flight schools, largely because of an instructor
    shortage. The parallel situation exists in the US (and in any case the US is not
    suitable for foreign student flight training in the post-9/11 era.)

    need to be trained as older ones retire. This shortage of flight instructors will
    eventually feed into a shortage of pilots, which will shift the bargaining power
    of pilot unions vs. the airlines. In fact, the shortage is starting to be felt
    in the emerging markets, where there is not a ready supply of experienced pilots.
    In one instance, an airline based in an emerging market country offered a job
    to a recently a qualified pilot (commercial multi-engine IFR rating) as a First
    Officer (co-pilot) with the understanding that he would be promoted to Captain
    (pilot) after 500 hours of flight time. This would be the equivalent of allowing
    a fresh intern, one or two years out of medical school, to perform brain surgery.

    term as the United States heads into recession, which would likely result in layoffs
    at the airlines and create a surplus of pilots. Longer term, however, the shortage
    of flight instructors and eventually pilots is like the plankton disappearing
    from the ocean – it eventually makes itself felt all the way up the food chain.
