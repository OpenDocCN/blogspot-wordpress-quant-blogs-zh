- en: I don’t normally comment on fundamental analysis here, despite having been a
    small cap analyst early in my career. However, since Mrs. Humble Student of the
    Markets is a pilot and has numerous contacts in the aviation industry I thought
    I would make an exception.

  zh: 尽管我职业生涯早期曾是一名小市值分析师，但我通常不会在这里评论基本面分析。然而，由于谦卑的市场学生的夫人是一名飞行员，在航空业有众多联系人，我认为我应该破例一次。
- en: There seems to be a dearth of flight instructors in North America, largely because
    of the low paying nature of the job. Recently, Mrs. Humble Student of the Markets
    was involved in a feasibility study to bring students from China to Canada to
    be trained as pilots. To make a long story short, she found that there was little
    spare educational capacity at Canadian flight schools, largely because of an instructor
    shortage. The parallel situation exists in the US (and in any case the US is not
    suitable for foreign student flight training in the post-9/11 era.)

  zh: 北美似乎出现了飞行教练的短缺，这主要是因为这份工作的薪酬较低。最近，谦卑的市场学生的夫人参与了一项可行性研究，将中国学生带到加拿大接受飞行员培训。长话短说，她发现加拿大飞行学校的教育资源非常紧张，很大程度上是因为教练短缺。美国的情况也类似（而且无论如何，在9/11之后的年代，美国并不适合外国学生进行飞行训练。）
- en: Why does that matter? It matters because pilots, and airline pilots in particular,
    need to be trained as older ones retire. This shortage of flight instructors will
    eventually feed into a shortage of pilots, which will shift the bargaining power
    of pilot unions vs. the airlines. In fact, the shortage is starting to be felt
    in the emerging markets, where there is not a ready supply of experienced pilots.
    In one instance, an airline based in an emerging market country offered a job
    to a recently a qualified pilot (commercial multi-engine IFR rating) as a First
    Officer (co-pilot) with the understanding that he would be promoted to Captain
    (pilot) after 500 hours of flight time. This would be the equivalent of allowing
    a fresh intern, one or two years out of medical school, to perform brain surgery.

  zh: 这为什么重要？因为飞行员，尤其是航空公司飞行员，需要接受培训以替代退休的资深飞行员。这种飞行教练的短缺最终会导致飞行员短缺，这将改变飞行员工会与航空公司之间的议价能力。实际上，这种短缺开始在新兴市场中被感受到，那里没有经验丰富的飞行员供应。在某个例子中，一个新兴市场国家的航空公司聘请了一位刚获得资格的飞行员（具有商业多引擎IFR等级）作为一等副驾驶（副机长），并约定他在飞行500小时后晋升为机长（飞行员）。这相当于允许一个刚从医学院毕业一两年左右的实习生进行脑部手术。
- en: Back in North America, it probably doesn’t make a huge difference in the medium
    term as the United States heads into recession, which would likely result in layoffs
    at the airlines and create a surplus of pilots. Longer term, however, the shortage
    of flight instructors and eventually pilots is like the plankton disappearing
    from the ocean – it eventually makes itself felt all the way up the food chain.

  zh: 在北美，随着美国陷入衰退，从中期来看，这或许不会造成太大影响，这可能导致航空公司裁员，并造成飞行员过剩。然而，从长远来看，飞行教练的短缺，最终会是飞行员短缺，就像海洋中的浮游生物消失一样——它最终会在食物链的顶端产生影响。
