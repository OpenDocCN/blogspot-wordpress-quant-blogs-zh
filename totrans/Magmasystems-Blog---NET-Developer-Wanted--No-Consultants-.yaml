- en: A colleague of mine will shortly be looking to hire a great .NET developer as
    a full-time employee. I am putting out this job req for them, in case you know
    anyone who is looking to make a switch in the next few weeks. This is a good group
    to work. The manager is very technical, and gives the developers a chance to play
    with the latest technology.
