    laid some 30 million miles of roadways and are on course to build about 20 million
    miles more by 2050, a 60 percent increase in 40 years. Almost all will be built
    in developing nations and regions of huge biodiversity. New routes are today penetrating
    many of the world’s most precious surviving wildernesses, including the Amazon,
    New Guinea, Siberia and the Congo Basin.

    is seeking valuable resources such as timber or oil, farmers are clearing new
    land for crops, governments are trying to make transportation and trade easier.
    Unfortunately, there's far too little coordinated effort to reduce the environmental
    impact. As a result, wildlife habitats will suffer huge losses and ecosystems
    will be destroyed, ultimately undermining Earth's capacity to support human life
    as well.

    go a long way toward avoiding this disaster. The key is that vast tracts of settled
    land, where ecological damage is already significant and probably irreversible,
    still aren't very productive. Better access to fertilizers and modern farming
    technologies would greatly boost the productivity of such areas, thereby reducing
    the need for development in more sensitive areas.

    benefits, and others where little benefit would be expected despite large environmental
    costs. If countries worked together, such information could be used to guide road
    building over the coming decades, helping to preserve the fragile biosphere without

    way. Inevitably, of course, it would also mean that some local interests would
    have to give way to global demands. Governments, individuals and firms would sometimes
    be constrained by the needs of the greater whole. That's what coordination implies,
    and it's what we need if we're going to preserve our world and still boost agriculture
    to meet the global demand for food, which will likely double by 2050.

    growth such as climate change and water supply. Instead of turning inward and
    closing off, humans need to cooperate and coordinate on an unprecedented scale.
    In essence, we're in a race to learn fast enough to avert our own demise. If we
    want to win, we'll have to change strategy soon.
