    but after a year of introductory macro, and having one quarter with models from
    a Keynesian, another quarter with models from a supply-sider (eg, Kydland & Prescott),
    it was clear to me they were overfitting the data, and reconciliation was not
    in the cards. They simply did not have enough business cycles to distinguish between
    very different theories, and it was too easy to fix models after every new decade's
    surprise.

    about 10 recessions. There are hundreds of time series (consumption, consumption
    per capita, non-durable consumption per capita) where one can derive a model that
    explains things. Given the failure of economists to forsee the stagflation of
    the 1970s, the disinflation of the 1980s, the fall in velocity in the 1980s, the
    growth of the Asian Tigers, the relative productive power of capitalist economies
    (most thought the Soviet Union's savings rate would necessarily generate higher
    productivity in a generation circa 1960), it is difficult to see what what else
    is needed to be discouraged. I've made several strategic errors in my career;
    leaving macroeconomics was not one of them.

    intuitive economists. But intuition necessarily plays a limited role in macroeconomics.
    There are just too many things going on in a macroeconomic model of any interest
    to rely on intuition alone. ... The good news is that, thanks in part to the people
    on this list [top macroeconomists mentioned earlier], we’ve made enormous progress
    in the kind of realistic complications that we can usefully model.

    via experience. In a productive scientific area, like solid state physics, experts
    are much better than non-experts at knowing essential truths, but macroeconomists
    are as divergent on the big issues as anyone. That is, they cannot explain, let
    alone predict, recessions, just like journalists. Look at the divergent explanations
    for 2008: the Fed, too much regulation, too little regulation. Which is it? Who
    knows. They are still arguing about the causes of the Great Depression, and why
    we got out of it. I have my beliefs, but I realize I can''t prove them true.'

    Funds rate related to inflation and GDP growth in the decade prior to its proposal
    in 1992\. There are lots of dense books on theory that should have been helpful
    here, and one can retrospectively look in the macro literature to derive this
    rule, but lets be honest, high-brow theory was pretty irrelevant in the discovery
    of this useful rule.'

- en: Macroeconomics is the triumph of hope over experience, and has been no more
    successful than sociology. I think it's great that some people are working on
    this, but let's not kid ourselves that there has been any progress. It is easy
    to think that merely because a lot of intelligent people have published peer reviewed
    articles, knowledge must be increasing. The bottom line is the data, and real
    time experience with macroeconomic models has been horrible as always. It is nice
    that some of the bad models of the past are now known to be wrong, but the set
    of wrong models is infinite, so that does not imply we are getting closer to the
    correct model merely by excluding more bad ones.

    way the history of medicine used to be written, principally by doctors in their
    retirement, as a form of ancestor-worship (no doubt in the hope that they, too,
    would become ancestors worthy of worship). In this version, the history of medicine
    was that of the smooth and triumphant ascent of knowledge and technique, to our
    current state of unprecedented enlightenment. . . . [but] it is clear that for
    centuries it possessed no knowledge or skill that could have helped its patients,

    The simultaneous creation of a model that applied to aggregate variables (eg,
    aggregate demand) and national income accounting, created what Keynes thought
    would be the new era of the 'joy of statistics'. It hasn't turned out that way.

    the mid-1970s, and they talked of a whole floor of economists, forecasting at
    various industry and regional growth rates, the things one expects macroeconmists
    to know. When I got back into banking after graduate school around 1994, the large
    regional bank I worked for had over 10,000 employees and 1 economist, whose main
    job was public relations, not advising internal decision making, and this was
    a typical use for an economist. A few years later, they got rid of him. Macroeconomists
    are demonstrably not helpful to those institutions that could use economic expertise.
    Macroeconomists know a lot of stuff, just not anything useful.
