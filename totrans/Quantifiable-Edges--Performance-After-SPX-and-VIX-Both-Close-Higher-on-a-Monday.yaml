- en: The SPX and the VIX typically trade counter to each other, so it's a little
    unusual to see them both close higher as they did yesterday. It does happen from
    time to time, and Monday is the most common day of the week for it to occur. This
    is because the VIX has a natural tendency to rise on Mondays. Even so, when it
    has occurred on Mondays it has typically suggested a short-term downside edge.
    The edge is more pronounced and lasts longer when the SPX is trading below its
    200ma. Below are the numbers.
