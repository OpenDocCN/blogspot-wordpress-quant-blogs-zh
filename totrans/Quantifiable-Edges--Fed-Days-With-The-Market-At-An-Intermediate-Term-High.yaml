- en: Fed Days have generally exhibited an upside bias for about 30 years.  Many times
    this has been thanks to the Fed giving a confidence boost to a struggling market. 
    But what of those times where the market is already at an intermediate-term high. 
    With the SPX closing at a new rally high yesterday this is the situation the market
    is now in.  Below is a study that take a look.

    under these circumstances. There could even be a slight downside edge, but the
    numbers aren’t compelling enough for me to bank on that. I’d simply view it as
    neutral.
