    percent short of its high in October 2007.

    Bubble and should continue to be bullish for commodity prices and bearish for
    the USD. The chart below shows the ratio of Amex Gold Bugs Index (HUI) to the

    the general market.

    related to consumer demand-pull inflation. But we did see in today’s Investor’s
    Business Daily an article, which stated that governments have enacted 297 protectionist
    trade measures in the past year. (Amazingly, it was just over a year ago when
    the G-20 meeting was held in Washington when it was agreed that no such anti-trade
    measures would be taken.) The number of ‘planned measures’ has risen by 50 (!)
    in just the past three months — the pipeline keeps growing. This is why gold is
    a buy on pullbacks … like the one we have on our hands right now.

    is a warning sign for the longevity of this equity rally. The BKX made a plateau
    relative to the S&P 500 in the August to October period and has been falling since.
