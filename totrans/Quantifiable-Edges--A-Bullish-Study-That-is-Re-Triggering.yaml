- en: I mentioned yesterday that I am seeing a real mix of studies, and that remains
    true.  So after showing one for the bears yesterday, let’s look at a bullish one
    today.  You’ll hopefully recognize it because it last triggered just over a week
    ago.  I showed it in the July 30th blog and have updated the results below.

- en: The last instance was followed by a 4-day pullback and then a very large rally
    on day 5 that wiped out all the losses.  Results have consistently led to at least
    some upside over the short-term.

- en: There remain both positives (like today’s study) and negatives (like yesterday’s)
    to take into account.  Perhaps a little caution is warranted.
