# Humble Student of the Markets: The makings of a primary low

**Mid-week market update**

: Did the Economist do it again with another contrarian magazine cover indicator? At the top of the market, their issue cover was entitled "Big tech's $2trn bull run". Last weekend, their cover featured a "closed" sign on the earth.

The market staged an upside breakout through a falling trend line yesterday, and the upside held today. Notwithstanding the Bernie Sanders induced last hour weakness, it managed to put together two green days in a row, which has not happened since February 11-12\. This market action has all the makings of a primary low.

The contrarian in me is worried. I am part of the consensus that this is a bear market rally, whose scenario calls for a retest of the lows, which may not necessarily be successful. What could possibly go wrong?
