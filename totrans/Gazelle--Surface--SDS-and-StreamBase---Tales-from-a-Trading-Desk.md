## Gazelle, Surface, SDS and StreamBase

A number of web sites have postings on [Gazelle](http://osnews.com/story/21120/Microsoft_s_Next_Browser_To_Be_Based_on_Gazelle_), Microsoft [Research’s](http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=79655) multi-principle OS web [browser](http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/79655/gazelle.pdf). It remains to be seen how this research project will influence future Microsoft browser technology, but given the quality of work coming from MSR these days, it can only benefit all Window users in the long run.

I like the Surface business card applications from [Amnesia](http://www.istartedsomething.com/20090311/razorfish-amnesia-microsoft-surface-interactive-business-card-readers/).

The [SDS](http://blogs.msdn.com/ssds/archive/2009/03/10/9469228.aspx) announcement this week means that CloudTrader can now fully support an SDP trade database in the cloud. [Cloud](http://blogs.msdn.com/rxg/archive/2009/03/09/azure-multi-tenant-addressing.aspx) development just got a lot more exciting 🙂 The only downside to SDS is that I suspect some organisations are still going to have an issue with putting data into the cloud due to legal requirements about country etc. We also still need COMET functionality within Azure 😉 to stand any chance of producing decent [line of business applications](http://blogs.msdn.com/rxg/archive/2009/03/09/azure-multi-tenant-addressing.aspx) – maybe Kaazing or similar should consider this?

StreamBase looks to take advantage [of the Aleri/Coral8 merger. The sooner Aleri/Coral8 announce the roadmap for the combined CEP engines the better!](http://www.finextra.com/fullstory.asp?id=19746)
