    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

- en: For several weeks, I have been saying that a bear market rally could happen
    at any time, but the market keeps weakening. One of the challenges for the bulls
    is to put together two positive days, which they have failed to do. Another is
    to stage an upside breakout through the declining trend line.

    in the above hourly chart is the index closed while testing a support level. Should
    it stage an upside rally from here, the logical first resistance level is the
    first Fibonacci retracement at about 2700, with additional resistance at the 50%
    retracement objective of about 2840.
