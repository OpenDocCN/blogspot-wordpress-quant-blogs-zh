    I started to explore why the moving average strategy has failed for the last 2
    decades on the Russell 2000.  I still do not have an answer, but I thought looking
    at skewness and kurtosis might help explain some of the challenge of beating this
    index.  I think--but don’t have as much rigid objective evidence as I would like--that
    moving average systems work best when skew is negative and kurtosis is positive
    because that implies that the bad stuff happens below the mean when you would
    be out.

    even including 2008-2009.
