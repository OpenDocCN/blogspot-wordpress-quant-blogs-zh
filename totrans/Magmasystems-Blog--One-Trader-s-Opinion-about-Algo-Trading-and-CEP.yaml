- en: I was recently talking to a very technical algo trader from another company
    about CEP. I asked him why he did not use a product like Apama or Truviso for
    his algo trading needs. His reply was that it did not give him a competitive advantage
    if he used the same technology as other competitors used. He has the budget and
    the resources to build out a custom platform, one which he thought would give
    him a distinct advantage.
