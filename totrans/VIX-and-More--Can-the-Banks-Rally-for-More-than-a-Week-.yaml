- en: It doesn’t sound like a difficult task, but in the almost six months since the
    post-Lehman chill has descended upon the banking industry, bank stocks have been
    unable to put together a rally lasting more than a week.

- en: The chart below shows eight meaningful rally attempts since last September and
    only one of them, the tepid post-Inauguration bounce, was able to make it to the
    sixth day before turning lower. Today is the fifth day since the KBW Bank Index
    ([BKX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/BKX)) began to rally. The chart
    below shows data through yesterday’s close – and does not reflect the 4% drop
    in the index in the first three hours of today’s session. While February’s high
    of 27.99 is important to watch as a potential resistance point, it is probably
    more important that banks continue to rally past a fifth and sixth day, which
    would make next Tuesday a critical momentum check for the banks.

    as the critical driver of valuations. Until then, it will continue to be all about
    the banks.
