    job I have I don''t get paid for: raising my kids. Just because you aren''t getting
    paid does not mean something important isn''t necessary, onerous, and time consuming,
    just like paid jobs. It is a mistake to think those without paying jobs are or
    should be sitting around waiting for a foreman to tell them where to shovel.'

    states that need reorganizing. We all could invest more in ourselves by learning
    Java, or fix things in our house. Unless you are an invalid you have jobs to do
    that increase your wealth and that of the community.

    fit with various opportunities. Finding an occupation where one feels appreciated
    is like finding your comparative advantage, something you do relatively well,
    something that relative to others in that niche, you do with less cost and higher
    output. The common macroeconomic mistake of treating the unemployed like some
    homogeneous mass leads to the fallacy that bureaucrats with the public purse are
    best suited for giving people jobs. A good job, like the meaning of life, is something
    someone can't give to you, you have to find it for yourself.

    a job that makes one feel like they earned their pay, their respect, and this
    matters more than the level of their pay: a respected bricklayer knows he''s good
    and feels good about himself, much more than some executive vice president making
    millions doing a job that he knows is merely about exercising authority, something
    anyone merely decisive could do. Such jobs may have power, but as they don''t
    take any really special skill, just fortunate standing in some organization, the
    worker is financially wealthy but he does not have the same satisfaction.'

    recipient because it is degrading. That's why if you want someone to like you,
    ask them a small favor, it shows you appreciate them; if you want them to hate
    you, do them a big favor. A good example is how France loved America for needing
    their help in our revolution, so much so they built us a Statue of Liberty 100
    years later. After freeing them from the Germans twice in 30 years, however, the
    French find Americans annoying.

- en: I know people who had very firm-specific capital that is now gone. They need
    to find something similar but different, and taking them off task for government
    make-work will not help them find their best fit as soon as possible, it will
    do the opposite. A bureaucrat, who's not financially interested in your employment
    status, and does not know you well, will certainly find you a worse employment
    match in whatever job is given to you. Life has a lot of randomness to it, but
    thoughtfulness and effort help tilt the probabilities in your favor. Effort and
    thoughtfulness pays off, if only statistically.

  zh: 我认识一些原本有非常特定资本的人，但现在这些资本已经消失了。他们需要找到类似但不同的东西，而将他们从寻找最佳适合的任务中分心去做政府安排的无聊工作并不会帮助他们尽快找到适合他们的工作，相反，它会产生相反的效果。一个官僚，他对你的就业状况没有任何经济利益，并且不很了解你，肯定会让你在任何给你的工作中找到更差的就业匹配。生活中有很多的随机性，但深思熟虑和努力可以帮助你将概率倾斜到你的有利一边。努力和周到付出是值得的，即使只是从统计学角度来看。
