    World Index ETF (ACWI) shows an intriguing inverse head and shoulder formation
    forming. With the caveat that you shouldn't be betting on a head and shoulders

    could be considerable based on the technique of setting and upside target based
    on the distance from the head to the shoulder breakout level.
