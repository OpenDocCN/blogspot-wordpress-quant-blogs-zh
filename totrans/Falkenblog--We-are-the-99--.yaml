    of the False Consensus Effect, which states that individuals view their own preferences,
    behaviours and judgements as being typical, normal and common within a broader
    context; it also suggests we find alternative characteristics as being more deviant
    and atypical than they actually are.

    the prevalence of their specific phobia. Sort of like how economists, who have

    a distinct minority. It doesn't bother me too much because I believe in meritocracy,
    which is inherently elitist. This not only is a minority view (at least in public),
    but it by definition considers 'common' to mean 'crappy' in most cases. As Aristotle
    noted, just because people are equal in some respects does not imply they are
    equal all respects; men are equally free, but not absolutely equal

    to have a majority opinion, especially if you want to pass laws that make people
    do what they would otherwise not (eg, pay more to strangers in Washington, not
    marry their partner, not own a gun). But there''s no reason to brag about it,

    utterly absurd; indeed in view of the silliness of the majority of mankind, a
    widespread belief is more likely to be foolish than sensible.
