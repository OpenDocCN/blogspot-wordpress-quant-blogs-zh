- en: The importance of common sense macroeconomic factors is something that all traders
    agree upon. What is less obvious is how to take this information and convert it
    into an actionable trading strategy. From my experience in system/algorithm design,
    starting with simple strategies that are long/short and always in the market is
    always the most effective solution. In this case what could be simpler than using
    the daily direction of the euro (symbol FXE – an exchange traded fund ) to predict
    the S&P500 (symbol SPY-an exchange traded fund). After all, the fear of Euro-zone
    problems and the magnitude of the consequences is ominously comparable to the
    real estate and financial markets in 2007\. I mentioned this relationship earlier
    in the year as a factor worth watching since it was very successful at predicting
    the S&P500 early in the year. Clearly, the smart money is also watching this very
    carefully. **In this case, using this simple strategy of buying the SPY on the
    close when the FXE is up today, and shorting the SPY on the close when the FXE
    is down today is highly profitable.** Below shows the returns YTD in 2010 using
    this simple strategy. While this relationship has not always held true over the
    years, this is the first time that the Euro has been such a key logical driver
    of S&P500 returns. Intermarket factors are not like technical factors– they change
    all the time, and using a shorter window (60 days to 1-year) to track what is
    working best is often successful out of sample.
