    at 1.6%, compared to an expected 2.5%. More importantly, core PCE rose at an annualized
    rate of 3.4%, which was hotter than expectations and led to stagflation fears.
    Upon closer inspection, nominal GDP growth was dragged down by the combination
    of inventory adjustments and exports. Final sales, which is a better signal of
    economic growth, came in at 3.1%.
