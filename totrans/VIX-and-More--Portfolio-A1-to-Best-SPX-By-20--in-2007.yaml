- en: On the heels of a strong fourth quarter, it looks as if Portfolio A1 will finish
    2007 with at least a 20% advantage over the benchmark S&P 500 index since the
    portfolio’s February 16^(th) inception.  With one trading day left in the year,
    Portfolio A1 has a 23.4% gain, a full 21.8% better than the 1.6% gain in the SPX
    during this period.

    it to say with the likes of [MOS](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=mos), [DRYS](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=drys),
    [TEX](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=tex), [PBR](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=pbr),
    [RIO](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=rio) and others in the portfolio over
    the past 10 ½ months, we have been fishing in very rich waters.
