    it my weekly fearogram.  Why not?  "Fear plot" sounds a little too Halloween for
    my taste.

    and [October 3^(rd)](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/10/spx-vix-daily-correlation.html)
    predecessors, I attempt to show how the daily [SPX:VIX ratio](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SPX%3AVIX)
    compares to the median ratio for 18 years of data.  Interestingly, the chart shows
    a surprising amount of fear on Monday, followed by middling sentiment on Tuesday,
    before an atypical amount of fear kicked in yesterday.  Perhaps because the market
    opened in a relatively benign fashion today compared to some early futures projections,
    fear is actually below normal for the trading day so far.

    and hoping to provide an appropriate interpretive framework soon. My initial hypothesis
    is that the absence of fear will make it easier for the current pullback to continue.
