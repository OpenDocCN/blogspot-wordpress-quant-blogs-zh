    a new era of "secular stagnation," in which low growth is the norm, and much of
    it comes through temporary and artificial bubbles. Paul Krugman backed the idea

    a "just so" story to cover up and explain why economic policy and low interest
    rates haven't been enough to encourage new growth, yet also haven't caused inflation.
    It also fits together quite well with the usual

    comes out of quite standard macro analyses based on representative agent models
    with individuals and firms optimizing over time, and where -- perhaps most importantly
    -- things like debt overhang do not enter in any way into explaining how people
    are behaving (and why they may be hugely risk averse). That should be enough to
    raise some major questions about the plausibility of the story, especially in
    the aftermath of the biggest financial crisis in a century. For a lot more on
    such doubts, see the illuminating recent paper

    the dearth of global corporate investment, which drove the great recession, means
    that productive potential is shrinking despite corporate profitability, leverage

    right now is private sector confidence in the ability of governments and central

- en: Secular stagnation is a myopic and short-term view for two reasons. First, it
    is based on the experience of the Anglo-Saxon economies and parts of Europe currently
    as well as Japan since the bursting of the bubble at the start of the 1990s. Krugman
    muses that interest rates should be set at the growth rate of populations, because
    they would then be equal to a society’s potential capital productivity (and the
    long-term return on it). But the change in population growth is less relevant
    than the rise in productivity of an expanding workforce.

    to a trickle (although that may be improved by increased net immigration from
    southern and eastern Europe). But Germany’s productivity level and growth is high
    (as is total factor productivity, expressing the gains from technology). Italy
    has a similar stagnation in its working population, but its real GDP growth has
    disappeared because of the fall in total factor productivity — Figure 1.'
