    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    in the direction of the main Trend Model signal. A bullish Trend Model signal
    that gets less bullish is a trading "sell" signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend
    Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading "buy" signal. The history of
    actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of the trading model are shown by
    the arrows in the chart below. The turnover rate of the trading model is high,
    and it has varied between 150% to 200% per month.

    Butters of FactSet shows that the market is not responding to good news during
    Q3 earnings season. Stocks that beat expectations saw their prices fall at a level
    that was last seen in 2011\. This is all occurring when the EPS and sales beat
    rates are either average or slightly average compared to their 5-year averages.

    overall tone to the market. As the chart below shows, companies that have beaten
    expectations performed slightly worse than ones that reported in-line, while companies
    that disappointed were punished.
