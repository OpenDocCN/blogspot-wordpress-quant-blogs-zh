    that gets less bullish is a trading "sell" signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend
    Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading "buy" signal. The history of
    actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of the trading model are shown by

    Butters of FactSet shows that the market is not responding to good news during
    Q3 earnings season. Stocks that beat expectations saw their prices fall at a level
    that was last seen in 2011\. This is all occurring when the EPS and sales beat
    rates are either average or slightly average compared to their 5-year averages.
