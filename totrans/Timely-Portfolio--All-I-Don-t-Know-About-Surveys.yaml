    I wanted to make sure that I shared for anyone that might find it helpful or inspirational.  
    There are lots of ways to get Google Docs into R, but I choose the easiest and
    least elegant.  Google allows publishing to the web as csv.

    following visualization of the survey.  If you want to see the full set of results,
