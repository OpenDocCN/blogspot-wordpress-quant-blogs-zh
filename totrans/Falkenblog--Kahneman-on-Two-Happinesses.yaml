    things. I think the implications of this school are vastly overstated, but he's
    a thoughtful, interesting, person.

- en: . His main idea is that there are two kinds of 'happiness', that which is experienced
    in a particular moment, and that which is remembered. The experiencing self that
    lives in the present, and is relevant when a doctor asks ‘does it hurt when I
    do this’? The remembering self is present, as when we ask ‘how was your vacation’?
    Happiness can be the memorizing self over time, or happiness when someone thinks
    about their life.

- en: He mentions that these two aspects are very different, and lead to different
    objectives. The correlation between people’s experiential vs. remembered happiness
    is 0.5, which is why you can ask someone ‘are you happy now?’ and get no correlation
    with income over $60k, and ‘are you happy with your life?’, and get a significant
    correlation with income over $60k. It’s the difference between being happy in
    your life, and being happy about your life.

- en: The difference between the two has been documented by by many experiments. For
    example, during colonoscopies in the 1990’s, back when the procedure was unambiguously
    painful, subjects would record their pain every minute. If you think of the pain
    going over a bell curve over time (rising and falling symmetricall), an experience
    that stopped at the top of the curve would be better than one that road the curve
    over its entire path. Yet the remembered experience that stopped at the top would
    be remembered worse, because the diminution of pain at the lower ending point
    would make the longer experience with more total pain seem ‘better'.

    generally prefer the memorizing self vs. the experiencing self.

- en: You can predictably manipulate the remembered experiences by manipulating endings.
    In the colonoscopy case, just remember to draw the procedure out longer, making
    it slightly less painful every minute, even though the procedure is functionally
    over. Go on a 1 week vacation instead of 2, because you will remember the experience
    it the same, as the memory of going to Greece is basically allocated a unit regardless
    of length once you go over a couple of days. This explains why people generally
    like having children, and find them adding to their life’s satisfaction, yet generally
    don’t like playing or interacting with their children.

    main points).
