    the Quantifiable Edges Subscriber Letter that I’d been discussing the last few
    weeks.

    To accomplish this he examined any time the Advance/Decline line made a 3-year
    high and then looked forward 3 months to see what the max drawdown was in the
    SPX. The SPX has not managed to make a 3-year high in the A/D line recently. It
    DID make a 2 ½ year high about a month ago though. So I re-ran the study with
    Tradestation data (which should be very similar) and used a requirement of a 2
    ½ year high instead of 3 years.

    of this test I rounded that down to 250 and multiplied by 2.5 to get 625 trading
    days. To estimate 3 months I used a 63-day period. Also note that the flat spots
    on the chart are times when the high A/D condition is not met.*'

- en: As you can see above, since 1970 there has only been one instance that saw a
    larger drawdown over the following 3 months than we’ve already seen this past
    month. Other corrections were generally capped at between an 8% - 10% decline.
    This doesn’t mean we can’t drop precipitously from here. The market has demonstrated
    several times in the past few years that it is completely capable of breaking
    records. It does show that we’ve reached an area where risk has pretty much maxed
    out in the past under similar conditions – at least temporarily.
