- en: I’m seeing mixed indications for the short-term over the last couple of days.
    One bullish study that the Quantifinder identified last night was from the 11/6/09
    blog and examined the exceptionally lopsided Nasdaq Up Volume %. Readings over
    90% are quite rare – especially so when the market is in a long-term uptrend.
    Below I have updated the November study.

- en: Instances are lower than I’d like to see, but with all 8 closing higher in the
    next day or 2, it appears worth noting this one. Extremely strong volume breadth
    going into riskier Nasdaq stocks has often led to some follow through when the
    market is in a long-term uptrend. Below I have listed all 8 instances with a 3-day
    exit.

- en: Especially notable to me is the fact that the worst drawdown for any instance
    was only 0.85%. Meanwhile, only 1 instance didn’t see a run-up of at least 1%
    within the next 3 days. This suggests limited downside potential and solid upside
    risk/reward.
