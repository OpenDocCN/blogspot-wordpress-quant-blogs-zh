    have decided to join the politicians in turning an artificial crisis into a real
    one. S&P says it plans a U.S. debt downgrade, regardless of any debt-ceiling outcome,
    unless it sees a "credible" plan to reduce future deficits by $4 trillion over
    the next 10 years.

    debate does not remotely make it any more of a default threat than it was a week
    or month or year ago. America's IOUs are still completely acceptable to the markets.

    whatever talking points are popular with their base. They aren't leaders, rather
    focal points who artfully persuade many who don't follow or trust markets, that
    the market is generally correct. When I worked at Moody's, we took a beating from
    KMV because this firm showed that their purely quantitative 'distance to default'
    outperformed Agency Ratings. A distance to default metric is basically a simple
    function of market cap (higher is better), volatility (lower is better), and debt
    (lower is better), which is basically a market cap metric (volatility and market
    cap are positively correlated). All I can say is that the ratings agencies said
    they ratings were not comparable, and then Moody's bought KMV and such embarrassing
    information is not mentioned much (yet never repudiated).

    kinds of ratings. As the markets are now questioning the AAA rating of the USA,
    it's only reasonable the Ratings Agencies too would ask these questions. Jenkins

    payment is based on priorities, and often governments choose to pay others before

    market trades debt at a certain level to downgrade or even discuss a downgrade
    only makes the ratings purely redundant. Without the option to draw a line proactively,
    the charade is over and Ratings Agencies lose whatever meaning they have.

  zh: 如果詹金斯暗示评级机构应该等到市场以某个水平交易债务才能降级甚至讨论降级，那么评级就变得纯粹多余了。没有主动划定底线的选项，这场闹剧就结束了，评级机构失去了任何意义。
