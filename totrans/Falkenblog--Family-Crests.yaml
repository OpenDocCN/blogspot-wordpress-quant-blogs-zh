    1860 or so. I figure they were probably not the proprietors of the Falkenstein
    lands, merely serfs or something. Why else move to America? Further, my name represents
    merely the patrilineal ancestry, on branch in a big bush of genetic contributors,
    which, though all from the Germanic/Swiss areas of Europe, this implies that the
    'Falkenstein' branch gets too much credit or blame for my genetic inheritance,
    as there were Bucholzs, Horstmanns, Boughs, Bylers and lots of other names that
    are just as much of me genetically. Perhaps, if I'm just trying to feel good about
    my ancestry, I should pick the most successful branch and emphasize that (eg,
    my mother's father's mother).

- en: Indeed, the Castle Falkenstein was built around 1280\. Assume that the most
    awesome, smart, sexy, Falkenstein from that period was my direct ancestor. That's
    about 30 generations ago. 2^30 is the number of parents of my parents etc. at
    that point, about 536 million people (obviously, this implies lots of incestuous
    repeats). Even if my father's father's father was The super cool Falkenstein,
    it's pretty immaterial in my genetic makeup. I'm sure they were lots of losers
    without castles in that list of 536 million. Thus, in the big scheme of things,
    I should be concerned about the those 536 million ancestor's allele frequencies
    which would be less a function of surname, than the geography of my ancestors,
    which is approximated I suppose my the surname of the, say, 16 great-great-grandparents
    I know.

    But, just for fun, I looked online at my family crest. Interestingly, it seems
    every family crest website has a different Falkenstein crest. One site lists the
    German and Jewish version of the Falkenstein crest, the difference being merely
    the colors. I bet both the Jewish and German side feels the other stole their
    crest [I'm not Jewish]. I have a suspicion these family crest websites are just
    making this stuff up.
