- en: Based on a tally of the licenses Thursday--using first names as a guide--60
    percent of the same-sex newlyweds this week are lesbians and 40 percent are gay
    men. Among heterosexual couples--to no one's surprise--the gender breakdown is
    50-50.

    to sex. Years ago, I remember a friend noted that it is strange men seem to all
    have more sex partners than women, because they are equal by an identity, a counterintuitive
    result. When I was single and talked about these things, it seemed like guys were
    gettin'' action all the time, relatively. But then do the math. If there are two
    sets of equal size, of things A and B. Every coupling of A & B means that the
    average number of couplings will be the same for A as for B. QED. As solid as
    the proof there are an infinite number of primes. Now, you can bring in professionals
    (ie, hookers), or gay men who have lots of sex, but this didn''t affect most of
    my friends. It was kind of shocking: I thought I only knew nice girls! This is
    proof that men generally overestimate and overdiscuss their sexcapades, while
    women don''t.'
