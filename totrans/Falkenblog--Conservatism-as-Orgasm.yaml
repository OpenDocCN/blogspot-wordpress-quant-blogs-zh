    I think are true and important. Perhaps my delight in figuring things out is not
    some appreciation I have developed, like learning to appreciate a Jackson Pollack
    or Bach cantata, but rather something instinctual, like appreciating landscape
    paintings or great guitar riffs.

    it is not much like the cocktail of brain chemicals released during an orgasm,
    including norepinephrine, serotonin, oxytocin, vasopressin, nitric oxide, and
    prolactin. The benefit of 'explanation' is a lot different, but no less physical
    (and thus the analogy retains).

    Such simplifications of reality, explaining more with less, is intuitively pleasing
    because it releases a burden on our brains, we now need hold and arrange fewer
    facts to see the same phenomena.

    that currently explains many things in our mind--global warming, Freemason conspiracy--then
    many facts explained by this old ideology are now free floating, unexplained.
    Letting those go must be as unpleasant as learning a new theory is pleasant, one
    is the other in reverse. The assumptions we adopt are largely affected by birth
    milieu, accidental in some sense and so obviously inferior in many respects relative
    to what an omniscient being would assume, so we have a lot of baggage.

    believe in libertarianism and String Theory), is definitively inferior in certain
    cases, and a better theory exists. In that case, it is costly to change, as you
    would unleash a flood of bad high-frequency brain waves upon scrambling your neat
    theoretical web that nicely holds many of your observations together. Thus, you
    reject the new theory and accept the anomaly in hope that an innocuous solution
    can be found, like the relativistic adjustments for really small or fast objects
    in the Newtonian paradigm.

    but because it is innately unpleasant to replace ideologies that currently seem
    to explain a lot of facts. Young people have lots of neurons but not many connections,
    so they don't generate so much cognitive dissonance adopting new theories, as
    their existing set of theories is pretty limited. Young people can learn a lot
    because they aren't contradicting much, so it's rather pain free. In contrast,
    an adult who learns something profound loses some innocence, and has to then rethink
    deeper assumptions.
