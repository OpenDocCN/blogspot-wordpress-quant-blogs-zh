# VIX and More: Portfolio A1 Continues Strong Finish to Year

Portfolio A1 held on to most of its gains this past week and now stands up 15.7% since the portfolio’s February 16^(th) inception – a full 14.9% better than the 0.85% return of the benchmark S&P 500 index during this period.

While some portfolio managers may be content to dial down their aggressiveness and coast in to the end of the year with an index-beating performance all but locked up, this automated portfolio has no such feature.  Instead, it will continue to try to squeeze out additional percentage points during the final two weeks of the year.  Given the current state of the markets, this could be riskier than most years, but this approach also happens to reflect my personal philosophy that it is generally best to press one’s advantage when things are going well.

No matter how the chips fall, it should be an interesting last two weeks.

There are no changes to the portfolio this week.

A snapshot of the portfolio is as follows:
