    But we are not yet seeing a big negative reading on the ROC to say that we have
    seen a washout selloff. When that washout eventually comes, there will likely
    be some big geopolitical or economic news to justify the selloff, and to help
    facilitate the washout selling wave. So when you hear that the sky is falling
    in the copper market, that will be the signal that the bottom is almost at hand.
