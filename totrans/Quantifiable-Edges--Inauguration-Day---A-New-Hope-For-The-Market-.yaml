- en: Many people throughout the United States and the world are viewing the inauguration
    today with a sense of hope. Hope that things (whatever things are important to
    each individual) are going to get better. This sense of hope is not unique to
    Barack Obama. It comes with every new President to take office. The question for
    us as traders is, “How has this sense of hope translated to stock market returns?”

    to past inaugurations. I limited the instances to only those inaugurations where
    a new president was entering office. I don’t think re-elections carry a sense
    of “new hope” the way a new president does. I also eliminated inaugurations of
    Presidents that weren’t elected (Ford in ’74, Johnson in ’63, Truman in ’45, and
    Coolidge in ‘23). I just don’t believe the same sense of excitement is generated
    by a replacement as by a newly

- en: Then again, perhaps not. Eisenhower wins the award for most market-friendly
    speech by juicing the Dow for 0.35%. Herbert Hoover’s presidency got off to a
    bad start immediately as the Dow lost over 2% on the day he was sworn in. (And
    we all know it got much worse after that.) George W. Bush and Franklin Roosevelt
    are not included on the list since their 1st inaugurations were on weekends.

    bias. Roosevelt is the hero here. Carter is the goat. Overall downside was limited
    and upside was fairly strong. The last 3 have been especially good.

- en: Mostly positive here. Obviously what stands out in these results is the 1933
    mega-rally. The market bottomed in July of 1932 near 40\. After spiking to over
    80 by mid-September it began to pull back again hard. In February of 1933 it dipped
    back below 50 – less than a week before Roosevelt took office. That dip led to
    another massive rally as prices went up about 120% in the next 5 months. Even
    that rally didn’t pull the economy out of the depression. And as nice as those
    5 months must have been the market then settled into a range lasting about 10
    years. It wasn’t until the 4th quarter of 1942 that the 1933 high around 110 was
    surpassed for the final time.

    to the 1930’s. Perhaps the sense of hope brought on by new leadership today could
    help to ignite a strong (bear market) rally as it did 76 years ago.

- en: Of course the main issues with this line of tests is that we are dealing with
    only 11 instances in 90 years. It would be quite dangerous to base any trades
    on just these results. I do find them interesting and somewhat notable, though.
