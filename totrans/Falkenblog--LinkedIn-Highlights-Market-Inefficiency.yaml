    , but such valuations seem high to most people, so there are more people eager
    to short than shares available, causing the 'borrow rate' to rise to about 10%
    annually (ie, you pay 10% on the revenue generated from a short sale).

- en: This perverse borrow rate shows up in the options market. The Feb 2012 $75 strike
    put trades around $19.80, and the $75 strike call at $14.00\. You can put on a
    Feb forward position in LNKD via options, by buying a call option, and selling
    the put.

- en: It currently trades at $74.77\. Now, if you are a long term investor, why pay
    $74.77 for the current LNKD, when you can by the Feb forward for $69.19? It's
    an easy $5\. Regular investors don't reap the borrow rate on their long stocks,
    that's all kept by the broker. So it appears that anyone owning this stock in
    such accounts appears to be leaving money on the table.

- en: Is this a market inefficiency? It depends on semantics to a large degree. Arbitrage
    does not exist, which for many is all that matters. But market prices are clearly
    biased, as whenever there are options available on stocks that are hard to borrow
    you have a large number of investors behaving suboptimally (there are about a
    dozen of these situations currently in the US).
