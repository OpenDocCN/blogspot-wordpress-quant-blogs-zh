- en: The Fed delivered a dovish pause today. In addition, Powell was given opportunities
    to push back with bearish scenarios, such as raising concerns over the recent
    risk-on rally as a sign that financial conditions are loosening, or the elevated
    levels of super-core inflation, but he declined to do so. It is becoming more
    and more evident that the rate hike cycle is over. The market is looking forward
    to rate cuts and it’s discounting cuts to begin in March and five quarter-point
    cuts in 2024.
