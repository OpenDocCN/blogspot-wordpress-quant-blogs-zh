    the cognitive biases they note in others. For example, the paragon of rationality

    argument; my position is mistaken," and then they would actually change their
    minds and you never hear that old view from them again. They really do it. It
    doesn't happen as often as it should, because scientists are human and change
    is sometimes painful. But it happens every day. I cannot recall the last time
    something like that happened in politics or religion.

    where some scientist, on the spot, changed his mind about something important.
    They might concede a minor plank, but never the big idea. Inconsistent data points
    are seen as fatal or noise depending on what side you are on. Almost all interesting
    economic phenomena do not have definitive proof, so basically most of what we
    argue about comes down to common sense, just as in political or moral debates.
    After all, we only have a handful of recessions, and the effects of deficits (say)
    on unemployment (say) depend on whether the economy was at full employment, and
    whether the spending was an automatic stabilizer or exogenous increase, etc. Basically,
    we are left with about 2 datapoints to extrapolate from, and these also had their
    own idiosyncracies (especially if one is old enough to remember them personally).

    one to have any belief they want on fiscal policy. That doesn't mean everyone
    is equally right/wrong, just that it's essential to have good prejudices, opinions
    on things that can't be proven from axioms. This is why the academics aren't much
    help, because IQ and education just allows one to distinguish what is true, false,
    or indeterminate, and not very good at establishing probabilities. That is, a
    good statistician like Joshua Angrist will have
