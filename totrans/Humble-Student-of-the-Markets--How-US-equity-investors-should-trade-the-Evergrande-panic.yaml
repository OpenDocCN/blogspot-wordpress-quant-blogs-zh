    Evergrande implosion. Fears are rising that Evergrande is turning from a liquidity
    crisis in which the company doesn't have enough cash to pay its obligations, to
    a solvency crisis in which the company's assets are less than its liabilities
    if it is forced to fire-sale its properties.

    The index decisively violated its 50 dma. Investors are becoming spooked not only
    over the possibility of an Evergrande contagion but a looming crisis in Washington
    over the debt ceiling.
