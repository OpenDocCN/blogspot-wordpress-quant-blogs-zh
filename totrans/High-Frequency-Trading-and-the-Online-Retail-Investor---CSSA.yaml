- en: I recently had a series of communications with Jennifer Gorton-a blogger from ForexIndicators.net
    about providing some unique educational content . When I was presented with the
    possible topic of high frequency trading it was immediately appealing to me because
    I feel that this is a huge factor in shaping the new environment of market dynamics.
    Long-time readers have often heard me opine about the dangers lurking in ultra
    short-term trading, after reading this article perhaps you will better understand
    what you are up against. Personally, I would never play poker against someone
    who could see my cards………

    have heard about high frequency trading.  High Frequency Trading (or HFT) programs
    are use by large financial institutions and hedge funds. These funds use the current
    market order information that they receive from the exchanges to execute quick
    deals, known as flash orders. The exchanges will give clients that execute many
    trades on the exchange information that is not readily available to the average
    retail trader. The average retail trader does not trade nearly enough shares on
    a daily basis to pay for this information from the various [stock and electronic
    exchanges](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2010/06/01/multi-dimensional-equity-curve-analysis/).

    these institutions that pay the exchange money for data before the retail investor
    can see it. The computer programs that the big funds have used have these flash
    orders to make decisions to buy and sell before everyone else can. Most believe
    that it is unfair for a certain group of banks and hedge funds to be able to pay
    for information before others are able to obtain it. This leads them to get ahead
    [of the market](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2010/04/23/predicting-the-market-from-the-inside-out-new-breadth-measures/)
    and take advantage of the small retail trader. To add to this, these companies
    are allowed to rent office space closer to the exchanges to place their HFT computers.
    Known as collocation, the institutions are able to get their orders transmitted
    faster because of their computers being located almost right next door. The HFT
    programs can make or lose money if the order is a millisecond or a microsecond
    too late. This is another reason why the average investor will not be able to
    compete with the programs and institutions.

    available to the market. When the computer programs trade back and forth with
    each other, over the course of the day, they reduce the size of the spread. This
    is beneficial to everyone, especially the little guy who is trading from his online
    broker at home. When the spread is smaller there is a greater chance that the
    average investor will make a profit. This is also true when trading in the [currency
    markets](http://www.bloomberg.com/markets/currencies/fxc.html). Most HFT programs
    focus on the equities markets because they can buy the valuable data from the
    exchanges. Because the [foreign exchange market](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2010/06/03/using-the-euro-to-predict-the-sp500/)
    is an over the counter market, there is no central exchange where institutions
    buy their info from. There are HFT programs that exist which analyze [Forex indicators](http://www.forexindicators.net/)
    and make buy and sell decisions off of those. However, because of the volume traded
    daily in the currency markets is so high, it is hard to gain a clear advantage
    and get ahead of other buyers or sellers.

    trading programs. It is also an advantage for them to have access to [market data](http://www.bloomberg.com/intro_markets.html)
    before everyone else. The individual investor, however, is not trading enough
    size to effect the direction of the market and in the long run will see more benefits
    than downfalls from these HFT programs. It is a bit worrisome when these stock
    exchanges will allow those who want to pay more for information to obtain it.
    The theory behind free markets was that everyone had a fair chance to make money.
    It does appear that the exchanges are being bribed by their best customers, hedge
    funds, and banks to obtain this valuable information first. It might not directly
    affect the average investor – however, in principle, what they are doing is just
    not right.
