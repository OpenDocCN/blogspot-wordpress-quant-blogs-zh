- en: I recently had a series of communications with Jennifer Gorton-a blogger from ForexIndicators.net
    about providing some unique educational content . When I was presented with the
    possible topic of high frequency trading it was immediately appealing to me because
    I feel that this is a huge factor in shaping the new environment of market dynamics.
    Long-time readers have often heard me opine about the dangers lurking in ultra
    short-term trading, after reading this article perhaps you will better understand
    what you are up against. Personally, I would never play poker against someone
    who could see my cards………

  zh: 最近我与Jenny Gorton-来自ForexIndicators.net的博主进行了一系列的沟通，讨论了一些独特的教育内容。当我得知了可能的高频交易主题，我立刻就被吸引了，因为我觉得这是塑造新市场动态环境的一个重要因素。长久以来，读者经常听我对超短期交易中的危险发表意见，读完这篇文章后，也许你会更好地理解自己所面对的挑战。个人来说，我绝对不会和一个能看到我的牌的人玩扑克……

- en: If you have a retail brokerage account and trade the equities markets, you might
    have heard about high frequency trading.  High Frequency Trading (or HFT) programs
    are use by large financial institutions and hedge funds. These funds use the current
    market order information that they receive from the exchanges to execute quick
    deals, known as flash orders. The exchanges will give clients that execute many
    trades on the exchange information that is not readily available to the average
    retail trader. The average retail trader does not trade nearly enough shares on
    a daily basis to pay for this information from the various [stock and electronic
    exchanges](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2010/06/01/multi-dimensional-equity-curve-analysis/).

  zh: 如果您有零售经纪账户并交易股票市场，可能已经听说过高频交易。大型金融机构和对冲基金使用高频交易（或HFT）程序。这些基金使用从交易所收到的当前市场订单信息来执行快速交易，即精明订单。交易所将向在交易所执行许多交易的客户提供不易于普通零售交易者获取的信息。普通零售交易者每天交易的股票数量远远不足以支付各种[股票和电子交易所](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2010/06/01/multi-dimensional-equity-curve-analysis/)的信息费。
- en: These flash orders that have been characterized as unfair are orders seen by
    these institutions that pay the exchange money for data before the retail investor
    can see it. The computer programs that the big funds have used have these flash
    orders to make decisions to buy and sell before everyone else can. Most believe
    that it is unfair for a certain group of banks and hedge funds to be able to pay
    for information before others are able to obtain it. This leads them to get ahead
    [of the market](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2010/04/23/predicting-the-market-from-the-inside-out-new-breadth-measures/)
    and take advantage of the small retail trader. To add to this, these companies
    are allowed to rent office space closer to the exchanges to place their HFT computers.
    Known as collocation, the institutions are able to get their orders transmitted
    faster because of their computers being located almost right next door. The HFT
    programs can make or lose money if the order is a millisecond or a microsecond
    too late. This is another reason why the average investor will not be able to
    compete with the programs and institutions.

  zh: 被视为不公平的这些精明订单，是这些机构在零售投资者能够看到订单前，向交易所支付数据费用收到的订单。大型基金使用的计算机程序会利用这些精明订单，在其他人之前做出买卖决策。大多数人认为，某些银行和对冲基金能够在其他人获得信息之前付费，是不公平的。这使得他们能够领先[[市场](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2010/04/23/predicting-the-market-from-the-inside-out-new-breadth-measures/)]，并利用小零售交易者。此外，这些公司被允许租用靠近交易所的办公空间，放置他们的高频交易计算机。被称为交易所轻置，这些机构可以通过他们的计算机几乎马上进行订单传输。如果订单迟了一毫秒或微秒，高频交易程序可能赚钱或赔钱。这是另一个原因，普通投资者将无法与这些程序和机构竞争。
- en: These institutions will argue that they provide much of the liquidity that is
    available to the market. When the computer programs trade back and forth with
    each other, over the course of the day, they reduce the size of the spread. This
    is beneficial to everyone, especially the little guy who is trading from his online
    broker at home. When the spread is smaller there is a greater chance that the
    average investor will make a profit. This is also true when trading in the [currency
    markets](http://www.bloomberg.com/markets/currencies/fxc.html). Most HFT programs
    focus on the equities markets because they can buy the valuable data from the
    exchanges. Because the [foreign exchange market](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2010/06/03/using-the-euro-to-predict-the-sp500/)
    is an over the counter market, there is no central exchange where institutions
    buy their info from. There are HFT programs that exist which analyze [Forex indicators](http://www.forexindicators.net/)
    and make buy and sell decisions off of those. However, because of the volume traded
    daily in the currency markets is so high, it is hard to gain a clear advantage
    and get ahead of other buyers or sellers.

  zh: 这些机构会辩称他们提供了市场上大部分的流动性。当计算机程序在一天内互相交易时，他们会缩小价差。这对每个人都有益，尤其是在家里通过在线经纪人交易的小人物。价差越小，普通投资者盈利的机会就越大。在[货币市场](http://www.bloomberg.com/markets/currencies/fxc.html)交易时也是如此。大多数高频交易项目都专注于股票市场，因为他们可以从交易所购买有价值的数据。由于[外汇市场](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2010/06/03/using-the-euro-to-predict-the-sp500/)是一个场外市场，没有中央交易所机构可以从中购买信息。存在一些高频交易项目可以分析[外汇指标](http://www.forexindicators.net/)并根据其进行买卖决策。但是，由于每天交易的货币数量如此之大，很难获得明显的优势并领先其他买家或卖家。
- en: It is no secret that most big institution firm profit off of their high frequency
    trading programs. It is also an advantage for them to have access to [market data](http://www.bloomberg.com/intro_markets.html)
    before everyone else. The individual investor, however, is not trading enough
    size to effect the direction of the market and in the long run will see more benefits
    than downfalls from these HFT programs. It is a bit worrisome when these stock
    exchanges will allow those who want to pay more for information to obtain it.
    The theory behind free markets was that everyone had a fair chance to make money.
    It does appear that the exchanges are being bribed by their best customers, hedge
    funds, and banks to obtain this valuable information first. It might not directly
    affect the average investor – however, in principle, what they are doing is just
    not right.

  zh: 毫无秘密可言，大多数大型机构都在从他们的高频交易项目中获利。他们能够在其他人之前获取[市场数据](http://www.bloomberg.com/intro_markets.html)也是他们的一个优势。然而，个体投资者的交易规模不足以影响市场方向，从长远来看，他们会从这些高频交易项目中获得更多的利益而非损失。当股票交易所允许那些愿意为信息支付更多费用的人获取信息时，这有点令人担忧。自由市场背后的理论是每个人都有公平的机会赚钱。但似乎交易所被它们最好的客户，对冲基金和银行贿赂，以最先获得这些有价值的信息。这可能不会直接影响普通投资者，但从原则上讲，他们的做法是不对的。
