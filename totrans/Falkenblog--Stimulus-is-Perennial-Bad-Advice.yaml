    an algorithm--ideally one with maximizing behavior by decision makers and a supply=demand
    condition--that is then jerry-rigged to fit the output. It's very easy given the
    many degrees of freedom, to generate models that seem to work really well because
    it can create time series that when you eyeball them, looks like a desired time
    series (this seems to encourage a lot of econophysics efforts). This is a really
    bad way to evaluate theories, because it's too hard to falsify, and too easy to
    convince yourself the model works.

    Prescott), and I think they were valiant efforts, but it''s important to recognize
    failures and move on, because wasting time on a dead end only helps aging researchers
    who are incapable of developing a new toolset maintain their citation counts.
    I''m rather unimpressed by the common tactic of using citations to validate research:
    suggestive, but hardly definitive. Unfortunately, bad ideas are rarely rejected
    but rather orphaned, ignored by young researchers. After all, proving something
    is wrong is hard, especially if that something is not so much a theory (the representative
    agent model), but rather a framework. It''s best to look at the gestalt and say,
    I''m just not going there, and leave it at that. So, the models of risk and expected
    return persist because they are intuitive on some level, and can generate results
    that seem to match broad patterns. They merely can''t predict, nor do they underly
    actually useful fiscal policy.'

    these problems, because there''s always the hope that even if one''s model dies,
    the mathematical techniques used in creating it will live on. It allows one to
    revel in rigor, and dismiss any particular model''s empirical failures. Many economists
    I think dream of being like string theorist Ed Witten: Fields Medal winner and

    predictions? Do large banks hire top-level macroeconomists? No and no. Hard core
