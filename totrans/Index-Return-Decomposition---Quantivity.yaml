- en: 'To begin, consider a trading observation: interday returns of individual stocks
    have a subtle relationship with their corresponding index. On some days, return
    for a given stock follows its index; other days, returns of stock and index diverge
    strongly. This distinction in behavior is commonly attributed to stock-specific
    “news”, interpreted broadly—whether known publicly or only privately.'

    A switching model arises when regimes are binary: ![\alpha \in \{ 0, 1 \}](img/d4b72d2b7819d4db2110c87f652f0556.png).
    An ensemble model arises when regimes are smooth: ![\alpha \in [ 0, 1 ]](img/36b28f10b2458c68b27ddc0dba545e36.png).
    For the latter, ![\alpha](img/9a53e012ad26523af8c1a6778d340c3f.png) can be understood
    as proportional decomposition weighting of the respective return series, and thus
    can provide smooth mixing between the regimes. Finally, sign of returns are explicitly
    decomposed as ![s_t \in \{ -1, 1 \}](img/81d33b065045ea524c0e70f77e8b012a.png),

    objective. For example, ![z](img/7d74f7d8fdd6545e22c6dd9de0af53b3.png) and ![i](img/6aed483d693a0743f647c27ec4372c2a.png)
    can be interpreted as basis functions. Alternatively, boosting can be applied
    by interpreting them as weak classifiers. Graphical models can be applied by introducing
    conditional dependence between ![r](img/77c7edfa0ca5ff951f4f75b75deb7f01.png),
    ![z](img/7d74f7d8fdd6545e22c6dd9de0af53b3.png), and ![i](img/6aed483d693a0743f647c27ec4372c2a.png).

    directional or not. For example, combining models for two stocks which share a
