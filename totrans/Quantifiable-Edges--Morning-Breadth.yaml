- en: Tonight…some indicator analysis. I think many times traders focus too much on
    pattern recognition and therefore only look at price. This is especially true
    of intraday traders. Looking at price and price-based indicators is like looking
    at the Grand Canyon on a black and white TV. You can see it, but throw in volume
    and maybe you’ll get some color. Breadth could get you HD. Sentiment gives you
    surround sound. Add some

- en: Many traders look at breadth measures like the Advance/Decline line or the McClellan
    Oscillator on an end-of-day basis. But let’s examine whether intraday breadth
    analysis can lend some value.

- en: I ran a test back to April of 2001 looking at 15 minute bars in the SPY, the
    NYSE Advancing Issues and the NYSE Declining Issues. I wanted to see if strong
    or weak breadth in the morning led to price strength or weakness throughout the
    rest of the day. The rules for this test were fairly simple.

    positive expectancy in the SPY for the rest of the day while weak a/d numbers
    show a mildly negative expectancy for the rest of the day.

- en: Traders may benefit from tracking early morning breadth statistics. While this
    is certainly not something you would want to trade on its own, it may help to
    confirm or filter trades you are considering. Using breadth in conjunction with
    price and other kinds of analysis can make for a potent combination.
