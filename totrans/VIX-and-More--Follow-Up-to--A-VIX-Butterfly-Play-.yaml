    trade I outlined yesterday in [A VIX Butterfly Play](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/02/vix-butterfly-play.html)
    turned out. I will try to keep the explanation short.

    the VIX February contract exercise-settlement value was fixed at a special opening
    quotation ([SOQ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20SOQ)) of the
    VIX that was based off of the SPX *March* options series. Today’s SOQ (ticker
    [VRO](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VRO)) was 48.40, which was 0.26
    below yesterday's VIX close.

    is that VIX options settle 30 days prior to the [options expiration](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/options%20expiration)
    date for SPX options in the subsequent month.]*'

    the trade breaking even at the extremes of the range. The maximum profit was at
    a VIX of 50.00.

    the maximum potential loss (with a VIX either at 45 or below or at 55 or above)
    was $1800\. At 48.40, the VIX just happened to close exactly halfway between the
    maximum gain and the break even area. As a result, the trade gained half of the
    maximum potential profit, or $1600\. Of course these profit and loss numbers are
    based on a position involving 40 calls (10/20/10). I consider that to be a 10
    unit trade. With the accounting on an individual unit basis (long 1, short 2,
    long 1), the profit would have been $160 per unit.

    is unusually high, as it was last night, the profit zone can be large enough to
    make it a positive expectation trade, depending on one's forecast of overnight
    volatility.
