- en: It should surprise very few readers that I elected to write about a subject
    that has garnered a great deal of attention on this blog, the CBOE S&P 500 Three-Month
    Volatility Index. Of course we just call it [VXV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXV)
    here. The Barron’s column, [Take a Longer View on Volatility](http://online.barrons.com/article/SB124648899704482887.html),
    is available to subscribers and non-subscribers alike.
