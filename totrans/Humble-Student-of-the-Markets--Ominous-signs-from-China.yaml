    in stimulating investment. We believe China is in a liquidity trap. With a low
    interest rate environment, further cuts in interest rates may not get much of
    an additional impact. Today’s problem in China is not about funding cost or bank
    liquidity, but demand for loans for real businesses. As companies in the real
    businesses struggle with surging costs, over-capacity, and weakened demand, the
    incentive to conduct real investments is low. It would take some structural changes
    to jump-start the momentum of investments in the private sector, instead of just
    through easing monetary policy.
