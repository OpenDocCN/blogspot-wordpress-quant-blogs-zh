    linear in time, standard deviation increases by the square root of time, so one
    needs to have a common time to make Sharpe ratio comparisons.

    a specific tactical rule with a model that generates an expected return. For example,
    if I think the market is going up, one can take advantage of this several ways:
    buy futures, options, bull-call spreads, etc. This adds degrees of freedom to
    the result, because often certain criteria can generate different Sharpe ratios.'

- en: I will assume one implements a linear position rule, such that a position is
    linear in the expected return of the strategy. Thus, if one expects a return of
    1%, one has half the long position as when one expects a return of 2%; if one
    expect a return of -1%, one has the opposite position as when the expected return
    is 1%. It is the proportionality between signals that affects the Sharpe ratio,
    not the absolute size, because whether I invest, on average, $1k or $1MM, it will
    have the same Sharpe ratio. As to whether linear is optimal, intuitively it is
    pretty close to optimal, basically saying that if conditional variance is constant,
    you put down twice as many chips as when you expect twice the return.

    stock, it does not matter. Some ‘thing’ has an expected return. This has a forecastable

    we simply apply the adjustment. For strategies that are not necessarily done over
    calendar time in constant increments, we assume t=number of sequential trades
    per year. This generates the following adjustment. You multiply the Sharpe by
    the square root of the expected number of trades per year. So, in this equation,
    you meake sure you have the number of expected trades in there, t.
