## Agile Testing – Moving out of the Comfort Zone

“[Hurricane Mike](https://www.waterstechnology.com/people/3524061/hurricane-mike-urciuoli-storms-jpmorgan-awm): Urciuoli Storms JPMorgan Asset & Wealth Management” is a great read on what it takes to change the culture of a large organisation.

Resistance is expected on such a path.

Solution – fly the “entire management team” to the West Coast, so that management grasped the concept and benefits of agile, “automated testing and unit test code coverage, rather than relying on feedback from groups of manual users.”

Game Changer 🙂
