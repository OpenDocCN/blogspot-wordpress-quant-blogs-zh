# Humble Student of the Markets: The 9/11 template

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2020/03/the-911-template.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2020/03/the-911-template.html#0001-01-01)

In my last post (see

[2020 bounce = 1987, or 1929](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2020/03/15/2020-bounce-1987-or-1929/)

), I had been searching for a template for the current bear market. I had suggested in the past that the roots of this bear has thematic similarities to 2008 (see

[A Lehman Crisis of a different sort](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2020/02/29/a-lehman-crisis-of-a-different-sort/)

). Today, health authorities are urging the use of social distancing to mitigate COVID-19, while financial institutions practiced similar social distancing at the time of the Lehman Crisis, which ended by seizing up the global financial system.

As the growth of COVID-19 cases continues outside of China, one other template comes to mind. 9/11.
