    went to African-American or Hispanic borrowers, of which some 210,000 paid higher
    fees or rates than the average paid by similarly situated "non-Hispanic White
    Borrowers."

    the average of all whites. It also goes without saying large numbers of minorities
    didn't pay higher rates, though Justice isn't interested in the average of what
    minorities paid, only that some minorities paid higher than the average of whites.

- en: If this sounds like statistical malpractice, it's apparently habitual. In a
    rare instance where defendants fought back, two Los Angeles car dealers recently
    won dismissal of a complaint accusing them of favoring Asian over Hispanic car
    buyers because 600 of 1,300 "non-Asian" buyers were charged higher loan terms
    than the average of Asian buyers. Notice that 600 is about half of 1,300\. As
    the dealers noted, Justice's claim amounts to an assertion "half of one group
    is above average, which means that the other half is below average."
