    red. The headline explanation was the Chinese authorities had taken steps to cool
    off stock market speculation. Later, I saw that there were jitters over a the
    unexpected Greek Presidential election call.

    but started to recover at around noon after the European close. By the end of
    the day, the SPX managed to recover all of its losses and close the day flat and
    the NASDAQ Composite and the small cap Russell 2000 were actually positive on
    the day.

- en: As the chart below of the SPX shows, the market displayed a classic pattern
    of a reversal bottom. There were also a number of quirky signs that today marked
    a bottom of any temporary stock market weakness. First and foremost, the 5-day
    RSI (top panel) moved from an overbought reading of over 70 on November 28 to
    under 30 on an intra-day basis, which indicates an oversold reading. Such conditions
    are often indicative of either short-term bottoms or minimal market downside.

    exceptionally rare, but once triggered is deadly for the bulls. The last time
    it triggered, the S&P 500 SPX, -0.02% shed 180 points — and the configuration
    now is almost identical to then.

    floor that is pressed for an indefinite amount of time,” Cook says. “Eventually
    the motor will run out of gas. Now, anything that comes out of left field will
    create a strain on the market.” Since the CCT is a leading indicator, prices have
    to catch up with the negative Tick readings.

    is similar to the new-high, new-low indicator,” he explains. “As the market goes
    higher, fewer stocks make new highs. Some people might say it’s ‘different this
    time,’ but it’s never is. Could the market go higher? Yes, it could, but the extension
    of time will create an even greater divergence that has to be snapped back together.”

    the publication of that warning in August but bottomed out that week (see SPX
    chart above).

    a guess that the near-term downside for stock prices is limited.
