# Zipkin – Distributed Tracing | Tales from a Trading Desk

## Zipkin – Distributed Tracing

Another Open Source project from Twitter.  Functionality and the screen shot on the [home](http://twitter.github.com/zipkin/index.html) page make interesting reading.

> Zipkin is a distributed tracing system that helps us gather timing data for all the disparate services at Twitter. It manages both the collection and lookup of this data through a Collector and a Query service

Not surprise to see Cassandra usage in the [architecture](http://twitter.github.com/zipkin/architecture.html)

Anyone used Zipkin from a Capital Markets perspective?
