- en: With the market set to gap up 1%+ this morning I decided to look at other times
    a 3% drop was followed by a 1% gap up. Below I have listed all 10 instances along
    with their intraday performance.

- en: Though the numbers don’t suggest a statistically significant edge, the early
    indications appear to suggest a tendency for further upside by the close. It is
    interesting that the avg run-up and avg drawdown are both about 2.8%. So traders
    could consider playing the intraday oscillations rather than taking a directional
    bet right off the bat.
