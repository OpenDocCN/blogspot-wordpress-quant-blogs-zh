- en: Eugene Grygo, the editor of the DWT newsletter, devoted his "Before the Spin"
    column to this news, and brought up some questions with regards to the future
    of DrKW. In particular, what will happen to the dream of cross-asset class trading?
    Grygo mentions that HSBC is actively exploring this space, and I know a few other
    IBs doing the same. Is it impossible to coalesce the silos and provide true cross-asset
    class trading? If it is technically feasible, then is it politically feasible?
