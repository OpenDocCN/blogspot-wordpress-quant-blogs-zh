    has always been that trying to regulate financial entities is like herding cats.

    to the extent that there was a bubble in credit or a bubble in the mortgage market,
    that created a bubble for people who could trade those products. There was a misallocation
    of resources not only into mortgages, let’s say, but also into the trading of
    mortgages, and it sucked talent into those areas that probably should be deployed
    other places. ***And the way talent gets sucked into those places is by a price
    signal, the compensation going out. So what was happening was that the pay scale
    for finance was just—incredibly out of whack***. You had guys who were literally
    just a couple of years out of college, maybe they’d done a year or two at an investment
    bank, making several hundred thousand dollars a year doing pretty low-value-added

    the kind of deals they were getting—because their pay tends to be not just a number
    range but a percentage of the profits they generate—they were getting very high
    percentages of the profits, and very high guaranteed income. The decision to pay
    those kinds of numbers was motivated by the fact that other places were paying
    those kinds of numbers, and their ability to pay those kinds of numbers was motivated
    by the fact that there were huge amounts of assets coming into hedge funds, and
    hedge funds are able to charge a management fee for the assets under management.
    So if you had tons of assets coming in, you needed people to manage those assets,
    you had to get quality people, you had a ton of money to spend, and everybody
    was looking for people who had a resume that singled them out, or that identified
    them as qualified to work at a hedge fund—there was just tremendous competition
    for those people, and it drove prices to ridiculous levels. It changed people’s
    attitudes—there was a palpable cockiness that one sensed from employees. And there
    was a lack of distinction I think between people who were really good, who you
    would want in any environment, and people who you could just fill a seat with
    because they had a resume that stamped them as minimally qualified.

  zh: 人们得到的报酬有点疯狂。对于那些更高级的人来说，他们得到的交易--因为他们的薪酬不仅仅是数字范围，而是他们创造的利润的一部分--他们得到了利润的非常高比例，以及非常高的保证收入。支付这些数字的决定是由这样一个事实所驱动的，即其他地方也在支付这些数字，他们支付这些数字的能力是由这样一个事实所驱动的，即大量资产涌入对冲基金，对冲基金可以为管理下的资产收取管理费。所以如果你有大量的资产涌入，你需要人来管理这些资产，你必须得到优秀的人才，你有很多钱可以花，每个人都想要那些能让他们的简历脱颖而出，或证明他们有资格在对冲基金工作的人--对于这些人竞争非常激烈，并且将价格推到了荒谬的水平。它改变了人们的观念--你能明显感觉到员工的自信。我认为，优秀的人，你在任何环境中都会想要他们，和那些你只是因为他们的简历而认为合格的人之间没有区别。

    in Europe in the 16th through 18th centuries finished a process by which monarchs
    gradually centralized power and dispossessed their feudal nobilities. Then, in
    the beginning of the 19th century, the rise of the European nation-state took
    this process a step further and dispossessed the monarchs while keeping intact

    commanders, criminal syndicates, and even blood-feuding families sought to resist
    state power, but they did not seek to overturn or replace it. This arrangement
