- en: It appears that managing the equity curve efficiency is inversely proportional
    to how well the underlying strategy is working. In this example, daily follow
    through works well in the 1982-2000 bull market and the method lags. As the market
    transitions to mean reverting and the original strategy falls apart then the method
    shines.

    equity curves) would be optimum?
