- en: For pure PoC‚Äôing, MySQL using the file import facility in MySQLWorkbench, running
    [D2RQ](http://d2rq.org/getting-started) to provide SPARQL access. ¬†Simple, and
    easy to setup.

- en: For more of a Hadoop platform, [HBase](https://hbase.apache.org/)¬†with¬†Apache
    [Phoenix](https://phoenix.apache.org/)¬†offering a JDBC driver, again allowing
    D2RQ to be used as the SPARQL access layer.

- en: Apache [Marmotta](http://marmotta.apache.org/), in many ways an improvement
    on Option 1 above, since it sits on top of standard [database](http://marmotta.apache.org/installation.html)
    technology.

- en: Option 1 is probably the quickest to move forwards with, once you‚Äôve become
    annoyed with accessing corporate data that is spread across n systems, and your
    still in Machine Learning Discovery land üôÇ ¬†If you‚Äôve used¬†Apache Marmotta, or
    have time to set it up and learning the platform, Option 3 maybe a better bet.

- en: Option 2 is probably the production version, or at least a stab in the right
    direction, as it offers improvements on scaling, coupled with Hadoopness üôÇ

    with R in less than 5 minutes‚Äù provide a quick and interesting read on the power
    of SPARQL. ¬†If your building a data lake without a foundation (ontology), you
    maybe missing a trick.
