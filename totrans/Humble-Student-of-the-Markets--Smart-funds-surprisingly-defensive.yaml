    are roughly in line with the HFRX Equity Market Neutral Index return of -1.2%.
    (Recall that this strategy goes long 5 Morningstar top rated, low cost and no-load
    large cap growth funds and 5 top rated value funds, called the smart fund sample,
    while shorting the S&P 500 Spyder (SPY) against the long positions.)

    of the long portfolio was about 50% per annum, it was virtually impossible for
    any manager, even with good foresight, to outperform the market both in the first
    half and the second half of 2008\. He would have had to be long the inflation
    bet in the first half and then switch to a low-beta bet in the second half. Indeed,
    the consensus sample of 20 large cap blend funds from the top mutual fund complexes,
    which usually perform in line with the market, underperformed by about 5% in 2008.

    portfolio, the strategy kept all of the growth funds and turned over only 3 of
    the value funds. Two value funds were taken out for style drift and only one was
    taken out for performance reasons.

    the exposures of the consensus funds, and looked for significant differences.
    Smart funds show a surprising level of defensiveness considering the number of
    well-known investors who have turned bullish in the last few months.
