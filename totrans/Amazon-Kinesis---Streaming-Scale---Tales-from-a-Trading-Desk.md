## Amazon Kinesis – Streaming Scale

Interesting additional to the Amazon [cloud](http://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/)

> Amazon [Kinesis](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/11/amazon-wades-into-big-data-streams-with-kinesis/) is a fully managed service for real-time processing of streaming data at massive scale. Amazon Kinesis can collect and process hundreds of terabytes of data per hour from hundreds of thousands of sources, allowing you to easily write applications that process information in real-time, from sources such as web site click-streams, marketing and financial information, manufacturing instrumentation and social media, and operational logs and metering data.
