    numbers would provide better support for revenue growth and thus alleviate the
    need for the other cited factors to do the heavy lifting. So it came as a pleasant
    surprise that the Markit PMI and the Manufacturing ISM reports came in either
    in-line or ahead of expectations, which raises the odds of more positive top-line
    surprises this Earnings Season. Scott Grannis at

    of the EM bond ETF (EMB) against US junk bonds (HYG) - a junk vs. junk measure.
    As the chart shows, EM bonds have weakened against US junk but there has been
    no signs of panic and relative support is holding - so far.

    overall market (SPY) is a sensitive barometer of risk appetite. IAI remains in
    a minor relative uptrend against the market and managed to beat the market on
    Thursday despite the selloff.

    readings are all supportive of the continuation of an intermediate uptrend in
    stock prices. To be sure, stock prices have gotten a little extended in the short-term
    and the market could pull back at any time. Moreover, volatility will likely increase
    as we move into Earnings Season.
