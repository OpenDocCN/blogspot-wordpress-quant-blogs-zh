    by failing to disclose that the party that picked the securities underlying a
    CDO was doing so to short it (Paulson & Co.). Their stock is down some 20%. In
    general, investment banks were caught up in the housing delusion with everyone
    else, which is why they too suffered so much in the meltdown. This transaction,
    however, is quite different.

    to create a CDO Paulson could then short. In effect, Goldman was the clearing
    house, taking merely a fee, while Paulson and the CDO buyers would have a future's
    type payoff. So, Goldman didn't really care what happened, they just wanted a
    deal done, to get fees. What makes this so special is that this deal was constructed
    when the first cracks were showing in the market, as the

- en: Goldman and Tourre got another company with a solid reputation, ACA, to be the
    official sponsor, because they knew no one would buy a CDO assembled by a short--too
    much opportunity to cherry pick the bad bonds. You don't need to do as much due
    diligence when you think the other parties involved have a consistent interest
    in your portfolio, so a sponsor with long-only interest is rather essential for
    such complex deals. Goldman told ACA that the collateral was picked by Paulson
    which would then hold the equity stake in the transaction. In fact Goldman knew
    Paulson had no such plans and wanted a vehicle to short, and as mentioned, there
    were articles discussing Paulson's shorting of subprime CDOs, so ACA was incredibly
    deaf. Nonetheless ACA was mislead (ACA soon basically failed, so they got their
    just reward).

- en: In securities markets, people often buy from those who think the price will
    fall. Yet in this case the seller's intention was material because when there
    is incomplete information, knowing the intentions of the parties involved makes
    a huge difference. I know from my litigation experience, that appropriate tactics
    are vastly different when dealing with parties who have good faith, versus parties
    with bad faith. Intentions, motivations, go a long way in explaining things, but
    the problem with blaming intentions is they are usually impossible to determine
    objectively, and so best ignored. In this case, the portfolio was constructed
    by a short seller so the intentions are pretty clear. Whether there's a law against
    this, I'm not sure, but it's pretty bad business.

  zh: 在证券市场上，人们经常从那些认为价格会下跌的人那里购买。但在这种情况下，卖方的意图是重要的，因为在信息不完整的情况下，了解相关各方的意图会造成很大的影响。我从我的诉讼经验中知道，当与真诚的当事人打交道和与恶意的当事人打交道时，适当的策略是截然不同的。意图和动机在很大程度上能够解释事情，但责备意图的问题在于它们通常是不可能客观确定的，所以最好忽视。在这种情况下，该投资组合是由一个做空卖家构建的，所以意图是非常明显的。我不确定是否有法律禁止这种行为，但这是非常糟糕的做法。
- en: While I think Tourre and Goldman deserve a smacking for this, it should be recognized
    that this kind of deal is not representative, and that most CDOs were created
    by people who sincerely, if stupidly, thought they were good deals. Note that
    Paulson is one of the few hedge funds that really cleaned up in this mess, most
    hedge funds missed it with everyone else. If shorts were primary drivers of CDO
    demand, this would suggest a giant conspiracy, so it's the proportion, not the
    principle, which leads me to think that understanding the 2008 credit crisis via
    these kind of deals is misleading.

  zh: 虽然我认为图雷和高盛应该受到批评，但应该承认这种交易并不具有代表性，而且大多数CDO都是由一些真诚的，尽管愚蠢的人所创建的，他们当时认为这些都是好的交易。请注意，保尔森是为数不多在这场混乱中真正大赚一笔的对冲基金之一，大多数对冲基金和其他人一样错过了这场机会。如果做空交易是CDO需求的主要推动力，那么这将暗示着一个巨大的阴谋，因此这与原则无关，而是比例让我认为通过这类交易来理解2008年信贷危机是具有误导性的。

    manager ACA that Paulson was the equity owner. I think that is the most important
    fact in the case, and is either true or false. Goldman does note that since they
    lost $90MM on the deal, and ACA lost almost $1B, they actually did think it was
    a good deal, which makes sense. Even if they are not guilty, they were really
    short sighted, and Fab Tourre is either an idiot or a scumbag, and Goldman is

  zh: ，反驳了美国证券交易委员会的主要证据，即高盛告诉阿巴科斯的经理ACA，保尔森是这笔交易的股权所有人。我认为这是该案件中最重要的事实，它要么是真的，要么是假的。高盛确实指出，由于他们在这笔交易上损失了9亿美元，ACA几乎损失了近10亿美元，他们实际上认为这是一笔好交易，这是有道理的。即使他们没有犯罪，他们的远见短浅，而法布·图雷要么是个白痴，要么是个卑鄙小人，高盛要么是愚蠢，要么是卑鄙的为了雇佣这种人。
