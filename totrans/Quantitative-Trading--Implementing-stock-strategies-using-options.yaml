- en: There are many stock trading strategies that are quite attractive in terms of
    Sharpe ratios, but not very attractive in terms of returns. (Pairs trading comes
    to mind. But in general, any market neutral strategy suffers from this problem.) 
    Certainly, one cannot feed a family with annualized returns in the single or low
    double digits, unless one already has millions of dollars of capital. One way
    to solve this dilemma is of course to join a proprietary trading group, where
    we would have access to perhaps x30 leverage. Another way is to implement a stock
    trading strategy using options instead, though there are a sizable number of issues
    to consider. (I recently brushed up on my options know-how by reading the popular

    (or even the day trading x4 leverage) only if you buy options only, but not selling
    them. For example, to implement a pairs trading strategy on 2 different stocks,
    you would have to buy call options on the long side, and *buy* put options on
    the short side (but not sell call options). Otherwise the margin requirement for
    selling calls is as onerous as shorting the underlying stock itself.

- en: The effective leverage is computed by multiplying the *delta* of the option
    by the underlying stock price divided by the option premium. If you buy an out-of-money
    (OTM) option, the delta will be small (smaller than 0.5), but the option premium
    is small also. Vice versa for an in-the-money (ITM) option. So you would have
    to find the optimal strike price so that the effective leverage is maximized.
    I personally choose to buy an at-the-money (ATM) call or slightly ITM call without
    actually computing the optimized strike, but perhaps you have reached a different
    conclusion?

- en: Naturally, the shorter the time-to-expiration, the cheaper the option and higher
    the effective leverage. Additionally, for ITM options, their deltas increase as
    we get closer to expiration, which also contributes to higher effective leverage.
    However, the time-to-expiration must of course be longer than the expected holding
    period of your position, otherwise you would incur the transaction cost of rolling
    over to the further-month options.

- en: The discussion of finding the right strike price based on its delta is moot
    if your brokerage's API does not provide you with delta for your automated trading
    system. In theory, Interactive Brokers's API provide deltas for whole options
    chains, and [quant2ib](http://exchangeapi.com/)'s MATLAB API will pass these on
    to your MATLAB exeuction program too. However, I have not been successful in retrieving
    deltas using quant2ib's API. If you have encountered a similar problem, and perhaps
    have found the reason/cure for this, please let me know. For now, I am reduced
    to assuming that all my near ATM calls for different stocks have the same delta,
    and I increase this common value from 0.5 to close to 1 as time passes.

    to buy at the open or close, one would incur significant transaction costs due
    to the much wider bid-ask spread compared to stocks. I try to use limit orders
    on options orders as much as possible.
