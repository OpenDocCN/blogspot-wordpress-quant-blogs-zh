    have missed posting my musing/ideas.  My recent departure was required to ensure
    a smooth transition for strategy deployment within the fund. I have decided to
    return to blogging as a means of enforcing creative output— believe it or not,
    the business of being involved 24/7  in operations, trading and marketing can
    cause a disruption in the flow of creative ideas. Paperwork isn’t too fun either………….
    The interaction with a crowd of intelligent readers always keeps me stimulated–
    you just don’t realize the impact until you stop writing.

    the time or spare resources to do much backtesting these days outside of internal
    R&D. However, it occured to me that my most popular posts were not backtests,
    nor were they based upon elaborate analysis. Readers seem to enjoy the indicator
    and system concepts the most, and secondly some of my lengthy rants on the nature
    of the market and the building blocks of good system development. In fact, I remember
    the first time I connected with Corey Rittenhouse–my long-time partner in crime–was
    due to posting a system idea on Donchian channels. Early readers may note that
    I began several posts with results presented  in table format using my limited
    excel skills. No pretty graphs, no fancy backtests—thank Corey for that. So it
    is time to go back to basics, and I plan to present new indicator concepts every
    week. Don’t expect me to post code, don’t expect me to post backtests. However,
    I would encourage readers to code my concepts and post links for other readers
    to source that code so that everyone can benefit.

    can keep up. I hope that readers can help with this process. Code for Tradestation,
    Amibroker, E-Signal, Wealth-Lab, and all other major platforms are requested.

    this week that time is an important element of stretch but that looking at the
    time above moving averages or other measures doesn’t capture the extremity of
    the stretch. Then it occured to me that the Parabolic SAR by Welles Wilder is
    ideal because it has a stop that accelerates and stays very close to the highest
    high or lowest low of the move while in a position. Thus the Parabolic Time Oscillator
    (PTO) is calculated as follows:'

    was initiated versus past trades. This is the PTO.

    to create two oscillators PTOup and PTOdown.  Use only 50 trades to calculated
    the percentile ranking for each.'

    You can also use this as a trend follower or trend trader to use as a guide to
    liquidate positions. Presumably as a move becomes very stretched in time, the
    probability of further profit before a pullback declines as the PTO reaches extreme
    levels.  However, once a pullback occurs from high PTO levels, it is likely a
    sign of very high probability entries with the trend.
