    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    in the direction of the main Trend Model signal. A bullish Trend Model signal
    that gets less bullish is a trading "sell" signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend
    Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading "buy" signal. The history of
    actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of the trading model are shown by
    the arrows in the chart below. The turnover rate of the trading model is high,
    and it has varied between 150% to 200% per month.

    limit to average GDP growth of 3-4% over the presumed decade of President Xi's
    administration (2013-23), driven by growth in household income of 5-7% and commensurate
    growth in household consumption. Although when it comes to China I have been the
    big, bad bear for so long that perhaps I tend to want to understate my pessimism,
    I nonetheless always try to remind my clients, sometimes not very loudly if I
    am in a public forum, that this is not my expected "most likely outcome".

    of credit growth for another 3-4 years at most, after which it cannot grow credit
    fast enough both to roll over what Hyman Minsky suggested was likely to be exponential
    growth in unrecognized bad debt (and WMP and other shadow banking assets will
    almost certainly be absorbed into the formal banks), and to provide enough new
    lending to fund further economic activity. If there is less time, as I think Anne
    Stevenson might argue, or if Beijing cannot get credit and rebalancing under control
    before then, I think we can probably assume my "orderly long landing" scenario
    is less likely.
