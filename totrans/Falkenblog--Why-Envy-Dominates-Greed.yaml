    of one’s consumption, or wealth, independent of others. Wealth can be generalized
    to include not just their financial assets, but the present value of their labor
    income and even public goods. Adam Smith emphasized a self-interest that also
    recognized social position and regard for society as a whole, but this was well
    before anyone thought of writing down a utility function, which is a mathematically
    precise formulation of how people define their self-interest.

    with a 30 point range in payoffs versus a 10 point range for Y. Yet on a relative
    basis, each asset generates identical risk. In State 2, X is a +5 outperformer;
    in State 1, X is a -5 underperformer, and vice versa for asset Y. In relative
    return space, the higher absolute volatility asset is not riskier; the reader
    can check this for any case in which the two assets have the same mean absolute
    payout over the states (i.e., the average for asset X and asset Y is the same).
    The risk in low volatility assets is its losing ground during good times. If X
    and Y are the only two assets in the economy, equivalent relative risk can be
    achieved by taking on an undiversified bet on X or Y, which is identical to taking
    a position on not-Y and not-X. The positions, from a relative standpoint, are
    mirror images. Buying the market, in this case, allocating half of each, meanwhile,

    the utility and arbitrage equilibria derive from the fact that when relative wealth
    is the objective, the risk is symmetric, as the complement to any portfolio subset
    will necessarily have identical — though opposite signed — relative return. Thus
    arbitrage exits if there is a risk premium (in a relative status world). One should
    note that a relative wealth world is just like a world where everyone is benchmarking
    against others, and note that most investment managers are measured relative to

    is buying whatever everyone else is buying, you have the potential for bubbles.
    As a sector like internet companies, or housing, becomes larger, one allocates
    more to it without much notice, because it isn't risky if everyone is doing it.
    My experience working in finance is that it is much easier to sell a new strategy
    if several of your competitors are already doing it, indeed, one should probably
    anticipate your superiors asking for good reasons why one is not doing what competitors
    are doing. An investment that starts off solid and gains conspicuous support can
    cross over into a bubble because at some point investment demand can create a
