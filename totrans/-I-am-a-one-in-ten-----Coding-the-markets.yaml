    another way, how much can we automate ?¬† [Mostly‚Äôs recent post](http://mostly.wordpress.com/2006/10/02/90-of-traders-face-the-axe-as-computers-take-control/)
    about only 10% of traders surviving growing computerisation made me think again
    about the automation of fixed income market making. Of course, the [IBM paper](http://www-935.ibm.com/services/us/imc/pdf/ge510-6270-trader.pdf)
    he refers to is somewhat self serving: IBM think you need to select a strategic
    technology partner to meet the challenges of the next 10 year. I wonder who they
    could be thinking of ?'

    management, and the pricing of liquidity. If we can do those, we make a lot of
    traders redundant, and maybe us techies can collect their bonuses üòâ¬† But how do
    we get the turkeys to vote for Christmas ?
