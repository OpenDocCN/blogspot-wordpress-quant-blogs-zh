Finally ordered by laptop. I was originally going for the Asus Z71V, but got talked into the Z70VA. It's a half-pound lighter that the Z71V, and has that fantastic-looking chasis. Here is what the configuration looks like:

Star (Asus) Z70VA
System + Carrying Case + AC Adapter
Z70Va CARBON FIBER COMPOSITE CHASSIS W/ 15.4in. WSXGA+ / 128MB ATI X700
Optical Drive Z70VA DVD/RW
Intel Pentium M 760 Processor 2.00 GHz W/ 2MB CACHE/ 533fsb
2GB DDR2 533MHz SO-DIMM
Mobile 100G 5400rpm hard drive
XP PRO
Intel 2915ABG Wireless Mini PCI NIC
