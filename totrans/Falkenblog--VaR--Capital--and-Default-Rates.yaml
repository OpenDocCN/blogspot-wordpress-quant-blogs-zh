    want to target a BBB default rate, you merely look at the capital sufficient so
    that the probability of hitting this extreme event is equal to an annualized default
    rate of 0.3% or so (the BBB annual default rate). I see this mentioned a lot,
    and I think it is pretty silly. VaR has its purposes, but setting top-down capital
    allocations is not one of them.'

    as a Master Trust versus like a set of static pools of debt. In a master trust,
    you have a sequence of new business coming on, and so the value of the master
    trust, if ever below liabilities, implies default. But no businesses have their
    present value calculated like a master trust. Instead, it is like a static pool:
    assets that are market to market are not the present value of the future strategy,
    but merely the value of the particular assets on the book at this time. You can
    mark to market various vintages of assets: those put on in various months, each
    with its own vintage. The present value of this strategy is not a direct function
    of those static pools, because you change your underwriting strategy over time,
    often because over time a strategy becomes obsolete. Even a true Master Trust
    might have an endogenously shifting underwriting standards.'

- en: Or to use a different example, lets say I were to buy low volatility assets
    with positive momentum. This is what I did in the Falken Fund from 1996-2001,
    which outperformed the S&P by 10% per year, and which Telluride tried to get me
    to never do again (one would think prior use allows one to use this idea going
    forward, but this might take a jury of my peers). Now lets say this strategy of
    longs had a mark-to-market below the value of my liabilities. Does that mean I'm
    bankrupt? Only if I am stuck with these specific longs forever. In that case,
    my current negative NPV means my strategy's NPV is also negative. But if I can
    adjust my algorithm, this just means that iteration of the strategy is a loser.
    Or, maybe this is only a temporary setback for my current strategy applied to
    this particular set of longs. When I throw on the next batch of new longs, it
    might work in the next period, and I might use a new variation that throws out
    longs beginning with the letter X.

    that is being marked to market because it is always in flux. Thus, there is really
    no relation between bankruptcy, the Value-at-Risk number, and capital.'
