    to intellectual property, and so it is a matter of empirically estimating these
    costs and benefits. In the book's case, this is mainly focused on patents, as
    opposed to confidentiality agreements, non-compete agreements, or trade secrets.

    there''s a case for quotas: assume sufficiently high increasing returns to scale,
    some spill-over effects, and you have the case for quotas (this kind of pretty
    reasoning led to Krugman''s fall to the Dark Side). The issue is whether empirically,
    giving a legislature the ability to grant quotas, to what degree will they be
    used in this area, as opposed to a pure rent generation via government fiat.'

    doing an empirical analysis. In practice, with enough data, the variables speak
    for themselves, and it will be obvious what they are saying. The problem is merely
    that there are infinite number of potential effects, and potential interesting
    variables to control for. For example, looking at stocks, we may be interested
    in their annualized returns and volatility. If stock returns are lognormally distributed,
    this completely defines their distribution. If they have fat tails, we need futher
    data, higher moments, or extremum statitics. If markets are not efficient, perhaps
    it helps to look at auto-correlation in returns over various horizons (daily,
    weekly), or various technical patterns (head-and-shoulders). The state space is
    infinite, you need a theory to constrain it.

    other things. You might look first at how the 'market' affects returns contemporaneously,
    or industry effects. You might look at size, or value factors. Again, the state
    space is infinite, and you need a theory, a story.

    at. The data then say how the functional form fits. If theory says variance, but
    it turns out that the result is really a function of the square root of variance
    (volatility), you can be sure that in 10 years no one will remember the theories
    that proposed variance, and it will all appear an unbroken advance in science.

    forms. Just identify what is important as an input and output, and then roll up
    one's sleeves and see what the data say.

- en: For people who hate models, I think the key to remember is they provide a useful
    scaffold to fit real data. That is, if you fit data without theory, you need a
    lot of it so it is not really bumpy, and without focusing on a small set of data,
    the combinations of potentially interesting data is simply too big.

  zh: 对于讨厌模型的人来说，我认为记住的关键是它们提供了一个有用的支架来适应真实数据。也就是说，如果你在没有理论的情况下拟合数据，你需要大量的数据，这样它才不会显得起伏不定，并且在不集中于一小组数据的情况下，潜在有趣数据的组合就太多了。
