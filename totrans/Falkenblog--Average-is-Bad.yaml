    consensus. This aristocracy is often derided as plutocratic, but as your average
    person is incredibly ignorant, I think as long as there's competition, plutocrats
    are much better than any plebiscite. Consider where 35% did worse than guessing
    on this

    your average investor is quite ignorant, and trips over himself needlessly giving
    money to brokers. They know more than experts on their daily affairs, but on generalizations
    and higher-level insights not in their bailiwick, they fail miserably.  I know
    literacy tests were disingenuously used to discriminate in the past, but I fundamentally
    the idea was sound, as currently it is just like letting fans vote on who gets
    in the football
