    the S&P 500 steadily rose to fresh highs this year, the Russell 2000 and S&P 600
    finally staged upside breakouts in November out of a multi-month trading range,
    but they have struggled to hold those breakouts. Small-cap relative performance
    peaked in March, but they have sagged and been flat to down relative to the S&P
    500\. In an equally disturbing development for the bulls, the S&P 600 Advance-Decline
    Line did not confirm the upside breakout by failing to rise to new highs in November.

    2022, but probably not in the way that you are thinking.
