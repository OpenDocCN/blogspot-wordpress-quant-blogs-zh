- en: In the 31 weeks since the launch of the [chart of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week)
    feature, I have created all the charts with the exception of (I believe) two of
    them. Going forward, I think it is time to relax this constraint a little and
    expand the scope of the chart of the week feature to cover a broader range of
    subjects, bring in a little more visual variety, etc.

- en: What better way to usher in an expanded chart of the week feature, but with
    a heat map of the second quarter performance of the S&P 500, particularly when
    the 15% gain in the quarter was the best for the index in eleven years. The [FINVIZ.com](http://finviz.com/)
    heat map breaks down the quarterly performance at the component level, grouped
    by sectors and industries, with the size of the squares being proportional to
    market capitalization and the color codes (and numbers) representing quarterly
    performance.

    worth exploring.
