- en: Based on one of the ways I like to apply the [CBOE Equity Put to Call Ratio](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/CPCE),
    this ratio has just turned bullish for the first time [since late April](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/05/cboe-equity-put-to-call-ratio-no-longer.html).  Like
    any indicator, [put to call ratios](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/put%20to%20call)
    are far from infallible, but looking at historical context, there is a good possibility
    that the recent surge in put activity will be enough bricks in the wall of worry
    to provide a base for another bullish move from current levels.

    it will be interesting to see how this plays out.
