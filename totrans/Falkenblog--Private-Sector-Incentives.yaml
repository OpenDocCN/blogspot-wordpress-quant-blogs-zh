    since (almost) every employee of a modern firm is a not an owner, and hence is
    incentivized to work hard only by her labor contract. A government agency could
    conceivably use precisely the same set of contracts and get precisely the same
    outcome as the private firm (the principle-agent problem is identical in the two
    cases).

    part of any initiative that makes money increases your pay and stature rather
    clearly. Now, the bigger the firm, the more people involved in any initiative,
    and the more people will exaggerate their involvement with successful projects
    and downplay their involvement in losers. But the bottom line is the bottom line,
    and the best way to get your boss to appreciate you more is to help him make more
    money for the firm. The scope of your command is rarely specified in detail, though
    increases in scope are the most obvious ways of increasing your power when the
    ''contract'' comes up for renegotiation: work is a repeated game. The government
    principle has a very different objective function than the private firm principle,
    the former with a diverse set of stakeholders to satisfy, often with vague and
    inconsistent objectives, the latter to simply make more profits.'

    dislike productive and smart direct reports because they sense their boss will
    recognize an attractive replacement. Yet even here the incentive clearly exists
    for this bad boss to be replaced by his boss, because his boss is not optimizing
    this position in that case (and watching the bad bosses employees leave when they
    recognize this is a really good signal that their boss is not a good one). It's
    also true that salaried employees like cashiers and secretaries may not be proactive
    about increasing their stature within the firm and simply follow orders, but their
    bosses recognize this and so are less likely to increase their responsibility.Every
    ambitious worker tries to make more with less all the time, because they can quantify
    this, which is the best way to go into an annual performance review. Just because
    you do not have shares in the firm does not mean you aren't highly incented to
    make money for shareholders, because the shareholder desire for more profits truly
    trickles down.

    organizations work as they do. The nice thing is that it isn't a really fragile
