    industry -- it is the axis about which the world revolves -- that the term "lost
    decade" refers to any ten year period in which the stock market actually declines
    in value. An entire decade of history is deemed to have been lost. Fortunately,
    such events are exceedingly rare -- or so most people think.

- en: that the likelihood of a lost decade -- as assessed by the historical data for
    U.S. markets -- is actually around 7%. That's the historical chance for the numerical
    or nominal value of a diversified portfolio of U.S. stocks to fall over a decade.
    Calculated in real terms -- adjusting for inflation -- makes the probability significantly
    higher, probably over 10%, not really an extremely unlikely event at all. The
    figure below (Figure 1 in LeBaron's paper) shows the calculated return over ten
    year windows over the past 200 years or so, and shows maybe six or so episodes
    in which the real return descends into negative figures.

    belief that long term drops in the market are truly exceptional events. As LeBaron

- en: Lost decades are often treated as a kind of black swan event that is almost
    impossible. Results in this note show that while they are a tail event, they may
    not be as far out in the tail as the popular press would have us think.... A life
    long investor facing 6 decades of investments should consider a probability 0.35
    of seeing at least one lost decade in their lifetime.

- en: Blake pointed out to me in an email that the term "lost decade" of course has
    much wider meanings that what I've discussed here, arising for example in discussions
    of Japan from 1990 to 2000 (and maybe longer).
