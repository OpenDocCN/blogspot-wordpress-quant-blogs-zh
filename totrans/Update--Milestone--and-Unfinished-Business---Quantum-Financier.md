# Update, Milestone, and Unfinished Business – Quantum Financier

**Update**
First of all let me apologize for being off the grid for so long and not providing you with any of my geek prose recently. My final university semester classes are coming to an end today and I will resume regular posting after finals. However rest assured that my absence of the blogosphere has not caused quant power atrophy, it was merely a by-product of how busy I was with school and interviewing. Thank you all for sticking up with me during this dry spell.

**Milestone**
I recently obtained 50,000 views, while not an incredibly big number compared to the blogosphere’s behemoths (see blogroll), I personally am really happy. I never really thought that this blog would take these proportions and it keeps surprising me by bringing opportunities I never thought would be possible, and for that I must thank you.

**Unfinished Business**
I know some of you were eagerly waiting for the TAA system post I kept saying would be coming soon; I am sorry to tell you that it will not. My services were hired by a private firm and the intellectual property developed is protected by a non-disclosure agreement. I might however discuss the intuition at a high level if the interest is still present.

Finally some of you might have noticed the new “QF Strategies” tab up top. For now it shines by its emptiness but it will not for much longer. I will be tracking strategies there soon, bear with me.
