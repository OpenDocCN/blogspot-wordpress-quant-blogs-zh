    of weeks, so as a result I tend to spend almost all of my time looking at charts
    with daily bars or intraday bars. As a consequence, I find that I run the risk
    of not focusing on long-term trends.

    force myself to study some weekly and monthly charts. I find that particularly
    when markets seem to be at potential inflection points it pays to take out that
    wide-angle lens and step back for some additional perspective.

- en: This week’s [chart of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week)
    is an attempt to do just that with the SPX, using monthly bars going back to 1998
    to put the last few months into historical context. What I see is a classic bullish
    bounce off of a cycle low that has now advanced just shy of the 50% retracement
    level. Stocks have been consolidating for the past 4-12 months, depending upon
    one’s perspective, and are likely going to soon be choosing whether to continue
    upward above the 1220 level and establish some new bullish momentum or fall back
    below 1010 and make a run in the direction of 666.

    does not necessarily make it any easier to discern the direction of the next big
    move, but it does a better job of laying out the battlefield and where both bulls
    and bears should be able to declare victory.
