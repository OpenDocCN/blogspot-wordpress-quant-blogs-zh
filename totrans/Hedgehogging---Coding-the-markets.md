## Hedgehogging

### April 17, 2007

Having finished [Traders, Guns & Money](https://etrading.wordpress.com/2007/04/03/traders-guns-money/), I’ve moved on to [Barton Biggs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barton_Biggs)‘ [Hedgehogging](http://www.amazon.com/Hedgehogging-Barton-Biggs/dp/0471771910). Hedgehogging is quite different from TGM. TGM is a mixture of anecdote, industry history and entry level tutorial on product structure. I learnt a lot, especially about products I’m unfamiliar with, like credit derivatives. Hedgehogging is all story telling, but no poorer for that, as the prose quality is very high, and at times very funny. Not many books about investment management can make me laugh out loud on the Northern Line at 6.45am !  I guess the closest comparison would be with [Niederhoffer](http://www.dailyspeculations.com)‘s [EdSpec](http://www.amazon.com/Education-Speculator-Victor-Niederhoffer/dp/0471249483).
