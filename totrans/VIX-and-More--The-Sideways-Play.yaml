    begin to pay attention to the possibility of a sideways market. As is often the
    case, both bulls and bears can make compelling arguments to support their position
    – and even back them up with a convincing set of facts.

    its bottom, there has been very little in the way of pullbacks during the ride
    up.

    recent highs and August SPX options set to expire at the open tomorrow. Still,
    it has been nine sessions since the SPX made its 2009 high of 1018\. Finally,
    while volatility has been declining, the VIX seems to have found a floor in the
    24-25 range.

    The charts below show that a single contract SPX September 1000 short straddle
    (top chart) has a maximum potential profit of $5000, with a profit zone between
    950 and 1050\. Traders who might be interested in the SPX October 1000 short straddle
    (bottom chart) have a maximum potential profit of another 50% or so ($7530) and
    a 50% wider profit zone (from 925-1075) as well.

    ([vega](http://www.optionstradingbeginner.blogspot.com/2007/06/option-greeks-vega.html))
    declines.

    looking to enter in a short straddle should expect monitor this trade closely
    and have all manner of exit strategies mapped out in advance.
