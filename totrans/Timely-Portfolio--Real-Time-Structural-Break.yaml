    How can I potentially use this in a system?”  Fortunately, one of the fine authors
    very generously commented on my post [Structural Breaks (Bull or Bear?)](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2012/04/structural-breaks-bull-or-bear.html):'

    real-time disturbance detection functionality using bfastmonitor() http://bfast.r-forge.r-project.org/Verbesselt+Zeileis+Herold-2012.pdf

    Please see the following paper for all the details.

    so I chose the excruciating and incredibly volatile period from late 2008 to early
    2009 as our example.  Amazingly, it picked with no optimizing or manual intervention
    March 2009 as the breakpoint. Of course, we would not know this until the end
    of March, but picking real-time with only a month lag is unbelievable to me. 
    Please try it out, and let me know your results.  Of course, I already have the
    30 year bond bull in mind as a next trial.

    with his animation package, which I used to create a good old-fashioned animated
    GIF.  I wish I had time to play more with the prettier and more robust options
    offered by the package.
