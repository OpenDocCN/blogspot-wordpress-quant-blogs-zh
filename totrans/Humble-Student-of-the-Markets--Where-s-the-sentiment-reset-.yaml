    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    onto the bearish bandwagon. In contrast, it would be a bad sign if they stubbornly
    hold onto their bullishness in the wake of the decline. In that case, contrarians
    would expect that an even deeper correction would be necessary to rebuild the
    Wall of Worry that would support a new leg upwards.

    Hulbert Stock Newsletter Sentiment Index fell, but rose again into the top 80%
    of bullishness. Such readings have historically been resolved with subpar returns
    over a 1-3 month time frame.

    basis, but even Hulbert's analysis shows a return of 0.0% over one month, which
    is hardly a wildly bearish forecast. The bigger question is, how vulnerable is
    the market in the short run?

    technical and sentiment analysis on its head. It is entirely possible that we
    are undergoing a period where sentiment resets briefly, and stock prices rally
    to even more highs as pictured by my green annotated periods.
