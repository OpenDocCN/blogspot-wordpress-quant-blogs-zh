# Intel Sandy Bridge: kdb+ v3 | Tales from a Trading Desk

> 来源：[https://mdavey.wordpress.com/2012/09/25/intel-sandy-bridge-kdb-v3/#0001-01-01](https://mdavey.wordpress.com/2012/09/25/intel-sandy-bridge-kdb-v3/#0001-01-01)

## Intel Sandy Bridge: kdb+ v3

kdb+ v3.0 (major release) follows other products in leveraging Intel’s Sandy Bridge technology.  Curiously, Kx Systems press [release](http://low-latency.com/article/kx-releases-new-version-kdb) sites [FX](http://tabbforum.com/videos/fx-challenges-fo-the-mid-tier?utm_source=TabbFORUM) as well as equities as one of the reason for the data expansion.  kdb+ also follows many web products in supporting WebSockets.  Unclear if one would really want to expose kdb+ over the internet from a security perspective 😉

Finally, I’ve heard that kdb+ is “expensive”.  Anyone care to enlighten me?
