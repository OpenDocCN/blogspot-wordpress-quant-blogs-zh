[Everything you need to know about the Great Rotation but were afraid to ask](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2020/11/14/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-great-rotation-but-were-afraid-to-ask/)

), it's time for an update of how global regions and US sectors are performing. The short summary is the change in leadership of global over US stocks, value over growth, and small caps over large caps are still intact.

While the long-term trends remain in place, some tactical caution may be in order in certain parts of the market.
