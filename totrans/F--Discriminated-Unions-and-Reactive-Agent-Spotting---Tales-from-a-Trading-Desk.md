## F# Discriminated Unions and Reactive Agent Spotting

I’m back to coding during any spare time I have – primarily the train commute. What am I coding? Well for the time being lets just says its a combination of C# and F#. From the last few days of coding its clear the [Discriminated Union](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/chrsmith/archive/2008/01/09/f_2300_-snippets-_2d00_-enums-and-discriminated-unions.aspx) should be used for internal plumbing, and one should never attempt to use them from C# – unless you want to endure a headache 🙂 As to actors, the key to actor usage is in my view identification of what would make a good actor. Actors remind me a little of the early days of [UML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language), where the identification of [nouns and verbs](http://uml-tutorials.trireme.com/uml_tutorial_4.htm) was a post conditions to use cases. Likewise actors and events appear to need a similar post condition.

Anyone using the Asynchronous Agents Library ([AAL](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ff959205.aspx))?
