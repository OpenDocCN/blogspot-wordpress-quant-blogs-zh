    “These May Be the Only People Who Want Yahoo to Thrive”.  I can only assume the
    oil traders are a niche user of Messenger, given the new Messenger platform has

    officers at some trading houses have declared off limits because the chats can’t

    with a blockchain backed messenger.  Further, it would allow the Oil Traders to
     further integrate the actual contracts into a Distributed Ledger,  offering a
    future based platform that is compliant +ve.  Chat and contract together in a
    Distributed Ledge would can only be a win from a Mifid viewpoint 🙂 – unified treatment
    of clients, trade interaction audit trail, and Organised Trading Facility ([OTF](http://www.nortonrosefulbright.com/knowledge/publications/118316/mifid-ii-mifir-what-it-means-for-commodities-firms)).
