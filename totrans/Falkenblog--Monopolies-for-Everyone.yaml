- en: Monopolies enjoy above average profits because barriers to entry prevent competition
    from lower prices down to their marginal cost. This reduces output, and raises
    prices for consumers, a suboptimal outcome. We all know that business monopolies
    are bad for the economy, even if they would help individual companies.

- en: and other liberal economists see attacks on unions as harmful to our nation,
    especially through its affect on inequality. Unions have monopoly power because
    the federal government gives them the power, not the right, to be the sole bargaining
    agent for workers in a plant or company, even if many of the workers don't want
    to be represented. That an economist like Krugman would see such monopolies as
    a good thing highlights the fact that economics does not constrain or guide one's
    thinking, merely provides another way to frame arguments.

- en: That the inefficiency of union monopolies is still disputed is one reason I
    don't take economics so seriously anymore. You can always find some convoluted
    reason why some partial equilibrium result generalizes, and so basic economic
    insights like the inefficiency of monopolies, trade restrictions, or taxes that
    favor debt over equity. It makes me think, what's the point of economics if these
    easy issues are still debatable?
