- en: If Friday was an “[unqualified success](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/01/first-day-of-trading-in-vxx-and-vxz.html)”
    for [VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX), the iPath S&P 500
    VIX Short-Term Futures (1 month) ETN, then today has to be considered even more
    of the same. The new [VIX ETN](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20ETN)
    has already exceeded Friday’s impressive [first day volume](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/01/first-day-of-trading-in-vxx-and-vxz.html)
    total, with 220,517 shares traded at after 1:15 p.m. ET, with two and three quarter
    hours of trading still to come.

- en: For the most part the bid-ask spread for VXX has been in the 0.02 to 0.18 range,
    sometimes higher and sometimes lower. I consider this acceptable for short-term
    trading of a security priced in the vicinity of 100\. Market depth is difficult
    to gauge at this stage but may be a little on the thin side. As news of the success
    of VXX spreads, however, I expect liquidity issues to be resolved fairly quickly.

- en: As was the case on Friday, volume in for [VXZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX),
    the iPath S&P 500 VIX Mid-Term Futures (5 month) ETN is running at about one third
    the rate of its near-term sibling.
