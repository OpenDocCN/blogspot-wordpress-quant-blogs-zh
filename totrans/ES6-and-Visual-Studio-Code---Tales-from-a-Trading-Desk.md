## ES6 and Visual Studio Code

The July [update](https://code.visualstudio.com/Updates) of Visual Studio Code finally offer some sense in the ES6 world.  Add in a jsconfig.json to the root folder of your project, and at a minimum add the following to the file:

```
{
     "compilerOptions": {
          "target": "ES6"
     }
}

```
