    silly pronouncements of some economists (Nobel Prize winners Robert Lucas and
    Eugene Fama among them) to the effect that "financial crises are by their very
    nature unpredictable." These are, in my opinion, essentially meaningless statements
    if at all examined; they''re the equivalent of an excuse: "don''t blame us economists
    for not having a clue the whole system was about to explode!" The column argues
    -- and this is the important point -- that lots of economists haven''t taken this
    easy and shameful way out, but have taken on the hard work of developing ways
    to measure systemic risks and, we hope, give us a better chance to detect important
    instabilities and imbalances in financial markets as they emerge. Many have even
    begun collaborating in their efforts with physicists, engineers and other such
    types. If they have a little success, then we might then just possibly do something
    to head off the worst trouble in potential future crises (IF the regulatory system
    doesn''t suffer massive political interference at just the crucial moment, of
    course, which I recognize is a big IF).'

    we know from just a few seconds' thought that crises are impossible to predict?
    In fact, doesn't the EMH tell us that? And isn't that sacred principle enough
    for us to stop all further thought? It's all a mystery to me why these people
    persist in what they're doing. [Sorry for the funny indent... I can't seem to
    get rid of it...]
