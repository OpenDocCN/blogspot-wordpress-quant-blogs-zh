- en: I recently ordered this [book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Apache-Camel-Developers-Cookbook-Cranton/dp/1782170308)
    on Apache Camel as this Fuse [example](https://github.com/FuseByExample/websocket-activemq-camel)
    on GitHub around websockets and ActiveMQ got me thinking about why there isn‚Äôt
    often tech stack discussions that include Apache [Camel](http://camel.apache.org/).¬†
    Further, as pointed to by a colleague, the old world of Apache Tomcat as a container
    being replaced by the likes of Apache [ServiceMix](http://servicemix.apache.org/)

    for Fabric8 üòâ¬† The age old issue of partitioning the code based may also benefit
    from bundles/features via [Karaf](http://karaf.apache.org/manual/latest-2.3.x/users-guide/provisioning.html)
    ‚Äì [iPaaS](https://github.com/fabric8io/fabric8).
