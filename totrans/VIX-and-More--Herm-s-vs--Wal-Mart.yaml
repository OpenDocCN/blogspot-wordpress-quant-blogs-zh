- en: Hermès vs. Wal-Mart ([WMT](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/WMT));
    upscale vs. downscale. It hardly seems like a fair fight in these trying economic
    times. The venerable Paris-based fashion ![](img/38dd5a9dc57e4c6368125fc04fba687d.png)house,
    whose customers range from traditional royalty to Paris Hilton and Madonna pitted
    against the world’s largest retailer, the Bentonville, Arkansas-based discounting
    behemoth, whose customers seem as likely to achieve fame on the [Jerry Springer
    Show](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jerry_Springer_Show) as anywhere else.

    retailers such as Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy that have been prospering as of
    late. Last month, Hermès reported a [12% revenue gain](http://www.forbes.com/2009/07/21/hermes-lvmh-ppr-markets-equity-luxury.html?partner=yahootix)
    for the second quarter. Today, Wal-Mart weighed in with a 1.4% decline in sales,
    citing “a sales environment more difficult than we expected.”

    chart below from StockCharts.com. The ratio tracks a ratio of the Claymore/Robb
    Report Global Luxury Index ETF ([ROB](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/ROB))
    to Wal-Mart. ROB’s top holdings include Porsche, Daimler ([DAI](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/DAI)),
    BMW, Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy, Hermès, Luxottica ([LUX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/LUX)),
    Pernod Ricard, etc. As the graphic shows, the luxury segment has been dramatically
    outperforming the discount retailer since the March bottom.

    to Wal-Mart. While this fact is not yet noteworthy from a technical analysis perspective,
    it does bear watching going forward.
