- en: My 17 month old daughter is very cute, of course (is it possible for a parent
    to think otherwise?), but as she is becoming more intelligent it is fun to see
    her inchoate intuitions. I go to pick her up from the child center, and she's
    in tears because a much older 2 year old took her diaper bag and is throwing it
    around. The women there can't understand why she's crying, but I know that it's
    because she always gets her diaper bag out of her cubby when I pick her up, and
    she sees that when others take her diaper bag it is 'not right'. The ladies think
    that kids are basically like caricatures of savages, people who don't care about
    who owns what. Thus, those in charge completely misdiagnosed the situation because
    they did not appreciate my baby's intuition for property rights, making my baby
    very unhappy, adults clueless.

    5%, also does not appreciates peoples' intuition for property rights. Currently
    the top 5% of earners make over about $150k, and they pay about 60% of the income
    taxes. I think they will respond by gaming the system, and their will be a huge
    elasticity in reported income.
