    Claus rally. Indeed, with relative breakouts seen in emerging market and European

    the market is also suggestive of a bullish view on the economy and risky assets.

    is the resource sector lagging? In particular, why aren't Materials and Energy
    leading this market upward? Until I can see participation from the resource sector
    in this rally, I remain constructive but cautious on this bull move.

    against the market (SPY). Materials remain range bound on a relative basis. While
    these stocks have shown some degree of relative strength in the last couple of
    weeks, they are by no means in a relative uptrend indicating sustainable leadership.

    in Europe is showing a similar pattern of relative performance.

    is in a minor relative downtrend against the market.

    The chart pattern for Dr. Copper, which is an important cyclically sensitive industrial
    commodity, appears to be constructive. The price of the red metal remains in an
    uptrend but, at the current rate of ascent, it will encounter important overhead
    resistance.

    unknown). Nevertheless, a relative performance chart of the equal weight Continuous
    Commodity Index (CCI) against the CRB Index shows a relative uptrend indicating
    positive breadth.
  prefs: []

- en: To explain, both the CCI and CRB have the same commodity components. While the
    CCI is equal weighted, the CRB is liquidity weighted, which gives a higher weight
    to the energy complex. Thus the CCI to CRB ratio is a measure of market breadth
    in the commodity complex. The relative uptrend shown in the above chart is an
    indication that the general commodity complex is performing better than the headline
    CRB - which is one reason why I remain cautiously bullish on the commodity outlook.

    as a sign that this rally has legs. If we don''t see sustainable relative strength
    breakouts from the Materials and Basic Industry sectors, then I would interpret
    such a development as a negative divergence and a caution flag for the bulls.
    For now, I am inclined to give the bull case the benefit of the doubt, but I remain
    cautious.'
