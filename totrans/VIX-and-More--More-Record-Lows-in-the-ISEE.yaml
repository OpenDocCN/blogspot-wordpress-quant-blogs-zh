- en: I haven't bothered posting about the [ISEE](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/ISEE)
    lately not because nothing of interest is happening with that index, but because
    the story hasn't changed. In fact, the ISEE has set new record lows in the 20
    day simple moving average for the past two days and the 50 day SMA for the past
    three days.

- en: The VIX may look placid, but be careful not to conclude too much from that one
    data point. Options buyers may not be panic-buying puts and driving up volatility
    readings, but their relative interest in buying calls vs. puts is much lower than
    it ever has been during the six years for which the ISE has published ISEE sentiment
    data.

    history suggests that the markets usually struggle after we have a lackluster
    VIX combined with investors who are reluctant to buy calls.
