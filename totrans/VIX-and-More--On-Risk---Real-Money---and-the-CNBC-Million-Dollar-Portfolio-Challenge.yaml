    that I had bought [VRTX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VRTX) for
    the [CNBC Million Dollar Portfolio Challenge](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/CNBC%20Million%20Dollar%20Portfolio%20Challenge),
    he decided to follow me in that trade with money in his IRA and was interested
    in hearing about my next pick as well.

    disclaimer on this site (I was wondering how long I would be able to get by without
    one) this seems like a good time to repeat my reply here:'

    in this CNBC contest is not to build a solid portfolio in risk/reward terms, but
    to take **as much risk as possible** in order to maximize the probability that
    I will be able to finish in the top 10 contestants by 5/14 and thus get a shot
    at the $1 million that comes in the subsequent runoff.

    This is something I would never do in real life -- and I know from experience
    that my risk tolerance is probability in the 99th percentile for the investor
    community, but given that there are 900,000 entrants and 10th place is already
    up 156% in just 6 weeks, I have no choice.

- en: Going forward, I will not be 'investing' in the traditional sense of the word,
    but rather rolling the dice with the most volatile stocks I can find. After the
    market closes, we have earnings reports from [ESLR](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=eslr),
    [IWOV](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=iwov) and [STX](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=stx),
    among others. These three stocks all have betas above 3.0, so I will likely jump
    on one of them in hopes of making a big move, but I would strongly recommend that
    someone using real money not follow a strategy like this.

- en: FWIW, my 'real money' take on VRTX is bullish, though I'd probably be moving
    up trailing stops to protect profits at this point. The problem is that in terms
    of 'contest money' I need to double my money (at least) in the next 4 weeks and
    VRTX won't be able to help on that scale.
