    the state of the market prior to the gap. When the market is already extended
    up the chances of a reversal down are much higher. One simple way to define an
    “extended” market would be to say if it has closed higher the last 2 days it is
    extended. Now let’s look at some test results. All tests were run on the SPY over
    the last 10 years. Results are based on $100,000 per trade.

    profitable and winners were about the same size as the losers.

    winners and losers are about the same size. The solid bullish tendency has switched
    to solidly bearish.
