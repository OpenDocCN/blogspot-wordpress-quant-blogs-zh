    of 23,000 barrels of oil per day at the end of 2007 and approximately 25,000 barrels
    towards the end of 2008. During 2011, the company estimates that it will reach
    production levels of about 50,000 barrels of oil per day. This forecast does not
    include the new discovery in Equatorial Guinea. The increase in production is
    expected to come from Norway during 2007 and from Tunisia and Norway during 2008\.
