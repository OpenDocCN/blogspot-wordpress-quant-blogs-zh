    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    hammer-like reversal candles. The first candle reversal was confirmed by a massive
    4.3% surge on the following Monday, will the same happen this coming Monday?

    the market has not sufficiently tested the February lows. Should stock prices
    retreat to test those lows early next week, the bulls can take some comfort that
    any test would likely be accompanied by positive 5 and 14 day RSI divergences.
    On the other hand, the bears are likely to defend the highs set in the rally last
    week, which could make trading the market an interesting challenge.
