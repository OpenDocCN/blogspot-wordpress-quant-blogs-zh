- en: suggested upside was likely over the next 1-5 days following Tuesday’s gap up
    and reverse lower. In my Subscriber Letter Tuesday night I suggested a gap down
    Wednesday morning to $134.50 or lower should offer compelling risk/reward for
    the long side. As luck would have it, the market actually gapped down and reversed
    up. I was glad to hear some traders were able to take advantage of this. So now
    the market has gapped and reversed two days in a row – leaving some participants
    scratching their heads and suggesting this market is acting crazy. In reality,
    it’s played out according to historical norms.

    a row as it now has? Assuming Day 1 is a gap up and reversal lower and Day 2 is
    a gap down that reverses higher I ran some tests. I tried running the tests with
    a number of different parameters, including adjusting the size of the gap and
    the size of the reversal. Generally this two-day pattern has led to short-term
    weakness – in effect reversing the reversal that reversed the original reversal.
    (Huh?)

    each day and a reversal of at least 1% from the opening price, the NDX has closed
    lower between 57.5% - 61% of the time over the next 1-3 days. Losses generally
    outsized gains as well. The pattern has occurred 41 times since 1986\. The next
    day the market lost 0.8% on average. It lost 0.9% on average over the next 2 days.

- en: The downside edge here isn’t huge but it appears overly optimistic to think
    today’s rally is going to send the market off to the races. In fact, the market
    seems more likely to lose a little over the next day or so and find itself stuck
    in the same range it has been.
