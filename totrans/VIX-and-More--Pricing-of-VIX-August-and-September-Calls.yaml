- en: The monthly [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures)
    and [options](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20options) expiration
    is a fascinating time from an options strategy perspective, as it marks the point
    in time in which VIX futures prices collide with the cash/spot VIX. Thanks to
    the [VIX Special Opening Quotation](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20SOQ)
    (SOQ), that price collision is an inexact one, but for all practical purposes,
    the VIX front month futures and cash/spot index converge once every month, just
    after the open on a Wednesday thirty days before the standard monthly option in
    the S&P 500 Index options the following month.

    VIX futures and options is the Tuesday session just prior to expiration.

    of the VIX product platform just prior to expiration, but because the VIX is capable
    of such sudden sharp moves [see [VIX All-Time Spike #11 (and a treasure trove
    of VIX spike data)](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2013/02/all-time-vix-spike-11-and-treasure.html)
    for some details,] options prices have to include the possibility of a sudden
    [VIX spike](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20spikes) right up
    until the moment of expiration.'

    high premium right before expiration. In the graphic below, I have captured some
    data from the TD Ameritrade/thinkorswim platform that shows the prices of various
    VIX calls as of about 2:00 p.m. ET that expire tomorrow, with just more than two
    hours of trading left in these products. For comparison purposes, I have also
    included the September options for the same strikes, which will expire on September
    18^(th).  For the record, at the time of this snapshot, the VIX was at 14.48 and
    the August VX futures (now available on the TD Ameritrade/thinkorswim platform
    as ticker /VXQ3) were at 14.43.

    implied volatility calculated for these VIX calls as well as the estimated probability
    that these will expire out-of-the-money on September 18^(th). Theoretically at
    least, the VIX August 25 calls have a more than 1% of expiring in-the-money at
    tomorrow’s open, while there is more than a 5% chance that the VIX September 25
    calls will expire in-the-money. With an implied volatility of 139%, the VIX September
    25 calls are currently bid-ask at 0.25 – 0.30.

- en: I am not recommending selling VIX calls just prior to expiration and I certainly
    would want anyone who is interested in these type of trades to start out with
    defined risk trades (e.g., [bear call spreads](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/bear%20call%20spread))
    before considering trades with unlimited risk...but the possible trading opportunities
    are fascinating, to me at least.
