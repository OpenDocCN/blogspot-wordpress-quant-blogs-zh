- en: It is not surprising that the threat of the dissolution of the Euro has been
    a major market influence these days. But one would expect that such a relationship
    would be coincidental rather than predictive. Over the past 50 days one would
    have made a 10.42% return by simply trading the SPY based on today’s direction
    in the Euro using FXE as a proxy. Thus if the Euro went up today, you would go
    long the SPY, and if it went down today you would go short the SPY. This model
    has had 60% accuracy at predicting the next day SPY return, and has made an average
    return of .19% per day.  Using the same model over a longer period would have
    resulted in significant losses–a -8.4% CAGR since the inception of the FXE. It
    brings up the important of paying attention to inter-market relationships–primarily
    when the underlying factor makes a high degree of logical sense.
