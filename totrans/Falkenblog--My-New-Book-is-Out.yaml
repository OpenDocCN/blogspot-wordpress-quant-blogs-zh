    in about 2 weeks that will be a little cheaper.  It would be a great complement
    to a Corporate Finance course, and should be of interest to anyone interested
    in the truth on something very fundamental: what do people maximize? I get into
    the why because people see what they believe, and if they understand low volatility''s
    edge they might appreciate it sooner.'

    an if and only if condition, so that if one does not exist the other must not
    exist, and vice versa.  Thus, it's interesting to note the extent neither exist,
    which has important implications outside finance. It's a new, true, and important
    idea that is presented without caricaturing the standard theory. The novel stylized
    fact presented is that across 25 major asset classes, risk premiums are the exception,
    except when they are negative.  That requires a new theory.

    this go-it-yourself approach created a lot of delays because my printer was not
    used to equations, charts, or Greek letters. This is simply a book that I would
    like to read and hope others might find interesting, recognizing this would be
    a niche focus. It's priced for the masses, but not written for them (it has some
    equations!).  I think any smart person should be able to follow my arguments without
    any prior knowledge, and the math presented isn't much more than simple algebra.

    then accepted as obvious.  While the idea that low volatility investing 'works'
    is becoming more common, the why remains rather unsettled.  I am happy to have
    my argument neatly summarized in one terse book.  Last Christmas it was about
    20% larger, but I got it down to about 60k words or 160 pages with about 30 pages
    of references and endnotes.  After years of being rejected by academics, and I
    guess in some sense this is an end run, as various journals have called my theory
     'obvious' and 'wrong', or that it was 'not of interest to the general reader

    was the focus of my dissertation, but experts had for years told me was obvious,

    individuals within specific companies (Acadian, Analytic, Robeco Unigestion) made
    this their focus and it subsequently generated above average returns. Passively
    owning high volatility assets is like being a minority investor in a Sicilian
    partnership, so simply avoiding these assets allows one to beat the benchmark
    index funds in Sharpe ratio sense much more than the change from active to passive
    investing (itself, a good innovation).

    as Ultra ETFs highlight the latent demand for all things risky, especially if
    they can be sold as a hedge (eg, the TVIX).  People are willing to pay several
    percent per year for the chance of getting rich without work, a lottery ticket
    approach to investing that relies on hope and possibilities over probabilities.
    Avoid this foolishness, and take risks where one has some conceivable alpha, which
    implies some control and responsibility.
