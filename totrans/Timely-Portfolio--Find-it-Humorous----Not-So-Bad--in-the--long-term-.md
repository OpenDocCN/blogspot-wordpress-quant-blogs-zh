# Timely Portfolio: Find it Humorous … “Not So Bad” in the “long-term”

I agree the market selloff has been weak thus far (especially as a frustrated bear).  However, I find it humorous as some widely followed commentators say things like “You’re only down x% ytd.  It’s not that bad”.  I wonder if this selloff gets worse will they extend to a 12 month horizon since last year was so good.  Immediately makes me think of 1987.

  **October 19, 1987** : Today was not so bad.  You are only down 3% ytd.
