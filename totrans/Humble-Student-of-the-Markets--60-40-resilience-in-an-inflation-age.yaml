    great macroeconomic experiment. Governments are spending enormous sums to combat
    the recessionary effects of the pandemic and central banks are allowing monetary
    policy to stay loose in order to accommodate the fiscal stimulus. Eventually,

    Balanced funds composed of simple stock and bond allocations will therefore experience
    greater volatility and higher drawdowns. Simply put, fixed-income holdings don't
    perform well in such environment which lessen their diversification effects against
    stocks and damage the resilience of balanced fund portfolio to unexpected shocks.

    on the bond market to simultaneously juice returns for decades, while adding a
    buffer to their portfolio against equity market risks. Those days are gone with

    all portfolios, said Sue Brake, chief investment officer of Australia’s A$218.3
    billion ($168.4 billion) fund. “But that’s over,” she added, saying “replacing

    real returns -- after inflation -- of just 1%-2% a year over the next decade,
    said Lim Chow Kiat, chief executive officer of GIC. That compares with gains of
    6%-8% over the past 30 to 40 years, he said.
