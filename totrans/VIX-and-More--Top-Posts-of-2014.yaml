    post to highlighting the top 25 most-read posts of each year. I do this in part
    for archival purposes: to see what is important to readers and how their interest
    in various issues changes over time. I also hope that these aggregations of most-read
    posts will serve as relatively easily accessible repositories of high-quality
    material for the benefit of new readers and long-term readers alike.'

  zh: 自从我八年前 plus 创办了*VIX and More*以来，我每年都会写一篇帖子，突出每年最热门的25篇阅读文章。我这样做部分是为了存档目的：了解读者认为重要的事情，以及他们对于各种问题的兴趣如何随时间变化。我也希望这些最受欢迎文章的汇总，能为新读者和长期读者提供高质量材料的一个相对容易访问的仓库。
- en: 'During 2014, the blog saw an extended hiatus for the first time in its history,
    largely due to events arising from the passing of my father. For this reason,
    I am limiting the number of top posts for the year to thirteen, largely because
    [Song for My Father*](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2014/10/song-for-my-father.html)
    ended the year in the #13 slot.'

  zh: 2014年，该博客在其历史上首次因我父亲去世引起的事件而出现了较长时间的停更。因此，我将当年的热门文章数量限制为十三篇，主要原因是[《给父亲的歌曲》](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2014/10/song-for-my-father.html)在年终排名第十三。
- en: Looking ahead, volatility is back and so am I. I miss writing and I miss the
    interaction with readers. In the coming year I will significantly ramp up my activity
    on the blog and also in the comments section. I will also continue to write a
    weekly [newsletter](http://vixandmoresubscriber.blogspot.com/) specializing in
    volatility (which just so happens to have a 14-day free trial), pen periodic [guest
    columns for Barron’s](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2014/11/how-to-ride-aging-bull-guest-columnist.html)
    and perhaps contribute to some other publications as well.  All this will be in
    addition to my primary role, which is that of an investment manager.

- en: In 2014, some of the top stories were [Ebola](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Ebola),
    [Ukraine](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Ukraine) vs. [Russia](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Russia),

    [the Fed](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/FOMC) and the European Central
    Bank.  The posts below represent those that have been read by the highest number
    of unique readers during 2014\. Farther down there are links to similar lists
    going back to 2008, along with several other “best of” type posts that I have
    flagged for [archival](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/archival) purposes.

  zh: 2014年，一些热门话题包括[埃博拉](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Ebola)、[乌克兰](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Ukraine)与[俄罗斯](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Russia)的对抗、[原油](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/crude%20oil)、ISIS/ISIL、[美联储](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/FOMC)和欧洲中央银行。下面列出的文章代表了2014年被最多独立读者阅读的文章。更下方还有回到2008年的类似列表，以及我标记为[存档](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/archival)目的的其他一些“最佳文章”类型的帖子。

    label to a handful of posts that I believe have particularly compelling and/or
    original content, regardless of readership. I was a tough grader last year, as
    I only added one new post to the HoF in 2014, but I already have an addition for
    2015 and my goal is to continue to crank out Hall-of-Fame-worthy posts on a regular
    basis in 2015 – and even manage to do it without assistance provided by performance-enhancing
    drugs…

    in my activity on Twitter, where [@VIXandMore](https://twitter.com/VIXandMore)
    gives me a platform to contribute more in terms of time-sensitive news, short-term
    insights and other related subjects.
