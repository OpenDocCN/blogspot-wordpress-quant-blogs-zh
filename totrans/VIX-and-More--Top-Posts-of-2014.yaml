    post to highlighting the top 25 most-read posts of each year. I do this in part
    for archival purposes: to see what is important to readers and how their interest
    in various issues changes over time. I also hope that these aggregations of most-read
    posts will serve as relatively easily accessible repositories of high-quality
    material for the benefit of new readers and long-term readers alike.'

    largely due to events arising from the passing of my father. For this reason,
    I am limiting the number of top posts for the year to thirteen, largely because
    [Song for My Father*](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2014/10/song-for-my-father.html)
    ended the year in the #13 slot.'

    interaction with readers. In the coming year I will significantly ramp up my activity
    on the blog and also in the comments section. I will also continue to write a
    weekly [newsletter](http://vixandmoresubscriber.blogspot.com/) specializing in
    volatility (which just so happens to have a 14-day free trial), pen periodic [guest
    columns for Barron’s](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2014/11/how-to-ride-aging-bull-guest-columnist.html)
    and perhaps contribute to some other publications as well.  All this will be in
    addition to my primary role, which is that of an investment manager.

    [Ukraine](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Ukraine) vs. [Russia](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Russia),
    [crude oil](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/crude%20oil), ISIS/ISIL,
    [the Fed](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/FOMC) and the European Central
    Bank.  The posts below represent those that have been read by the highest number
    of unique readers during 2014\. Farther down there are links to similar lists
    going back to 2008, along with several other “best of” type posts that I have
    flagged for [archival](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/archival) purposes.

    label to a handful of posts that I believe have particularly compelling and/or
    original content, regardless of readership. I was a tough grader last year, as
    I only added one new post to the HoF in 2014, but I already have an addition for
    2015 and my goal is to continue to crank out Hall-of-Fame-worthy posts on a regular
    basis in 2015 – and even manage to do it without assistance provided by performance-enhancing
    drugs…

    in my activity on Twitter, where [@VIXandMore](https://twitter.com/VIXandMore)
    gives me a platform to contribute more in terms of time-sensitive news, short-term
    insights and other related subjects.
