    fell much below the % of up days for the major indices. In noticing this he asked
    if anyone had a possible explanation.

    lot of it. I pulled the below data from Worden Bros. TC2000.

    While this chart only goes back to 1990, the strong negative bias exists all the
    way back to the inception of the Nasdaq in 1971\. Even during the Nasdaq bubble
    days of the late 90’s the Nasdaq Advance/Decline couldn’t muster a rising slope.
    Worden Bros. was obviously aware of this tendency when they set their beginning
    value at 10,000 rather than 0.

    has seen a slight decline, but it doesn’t have the consistent negative bias of
    the Nasdaq.

    the NYSE, so if a company is going to go broke it is more likely to do so on the
    Nasdaq. An issue which IPOs at $25 and heads to $0 will contribute a lot of declining
    votes each day along the way, and that is more likely to take place in the Nasdaq.
