    always parochial, because outside a set of small assumptions the rigor doesn't
    work, which is why no proof in econ has changed anyone's mind about an important
    issue.  Thus, in finance we had decades of focus on technical econometric issues
    (e.g., simultaneity of estimating the slope and the intercept, randomness in the
    risk-free rate, GMM tests of overidentifying restrictions), but not size (market
    cap) or low-price which would have killed the CAPM in utero. The omitted variables
    bias and overfitting remain the main scourge of social science empirical research,
    but that is only taught incidentally.

    is a very prestigious academic, and was on the faculty at Northwest when I was
    there in the early 1990s, and I showed him my results that low volatility portfolios
    generated huge 'alpha's in the context of Fama-French 3-factor models, and he
    couldn't have been more indifferent.  Yet, 12 years later he basically scooped
    me within the academic literature (my low vol dissertation findings never made
    a journal).

    primarily addressed the extension the returns are a function of changes in volatility.
    Now, at 30k feet this is a within-the-box extension of the standard model, but
    note they found it had the wrong sign, that is, stocks correlated with changes
    in volatility were volatile, and these had lower-than-average returns. Strange.
    When Ang et al got to the part of the paper that had the lasting interest, the
    low volatility effect, they then dropped any pretext of a model (as was laid out
    for their new volatility innovation factor) and showed the tabular results of
    alpha by volatility, which was the big addition to the literature. At the time
    (circa 2006) this was the kind of pretext still needed to introduce this result.

     Of course, if you are famous, you could have always gotten a break from an editor,
    which is why the seminal refutation of the CAPM came from Fama and French, as
    only they had the credibility to publish a paper seemingly refuting the paradigm

    because they could argue that their vague ‘risk management’ skills generated excess
    returns, which is tenable because presumably, risk is omnipresent and subtle,
    like the quality of a fine wine.  The theory was also very convenient to economists
    because it is perfect for teaching a course, where a set of seemingly innocuous
    assumptions creates a clear set of implications and is amenable to many rigorous
    extensions. At bottom, the CAPM made logical sense, so it had a principled rationale

    - is not "Eureka!" but "That's funny...", which is how the low volatility anomaly
    was born.  Funds like Unigestion, Robeco, Analytic Investors, and Acadian, were
    on to this pattern around 2006 even if they didn't have a full model explaining
    why it made sense. Unlike size or value, it isn't an anomaly so much as death
    blow to the standard paradigm. You can’t rationalize volatility as a risk factor
    because its return has the wrong sign with everything intuitively risky (covariance,
    leverage, size, liquidity, distress). Further, you can't simply add frictions
    to conventional model to get this as an equilibrium result, unless you invoke
    massive irrationality, and this isn't tenable because most investors are not irrational
    in the same way, there’s too much incentive (e.g., money) for that to work.

    then claimed to be the ‘father of low vol’ investing. He didn’t emphasize this
    in real time, however, rather he emphasized a multifactor alternative.

- en: 'First Paragraph of [my 1994 dissertation](http://www.efalken.com/LowVolClassics/efdiss94.pdf):
    "This paper documents two new facts. "First, over the past 30 years variance has
    been negatively correlated with expected return for NYSE and AMEX stocks and this
    relationship is not accounted for by several well-known prespecified factors (e.g.,
    the price-to-book ratio or size). More volatile stocks have lower returns, other
    things equal. In fact, one of the prespecified factors, size, obscures this inverse
    relationship. Second, I document that open-end mutual funds have strong preferences
    for stocks that are liquid, well-known, and most interestingly, highly volatile
    stocks."'

    in 2006, but was then sued by my former Hedge Fund boss, and actually had to defend
    that I came up with low-vol prior to working with him. Suit lasted 18 months,
    after which, I had little money to start a fund, and taint left me considerable
    operational risk (we settled).
