    The article offers a very simple Definition of Done (DoD) list, which is a good
    start ‚Äì especially as in many organisations ‚ÄúDone‚Äù is often unfortunately accepted
    as a word, with no real evidence.¬† I‚Äôd offer that what is missing from this list
    one of the constructs of a good story ‚Äì [acceptance](http://guide.agilealliance.org/guide/acceptance.html)
    tests.¬† Additionally, I‚Äôd say that ‚Äúacceptance test cases‚Äù need to be correlated
    back to acceptance tests on the story, else you could have somewhat of a delta
    between that the engineering team is using to test the story, and get to Done,
    and what QA is using to test the story ‚Äì one source of truth.¬† Mike Cohn sums
    up acceptance testing quite clearly for all involved in ‚Äútesting‚Äù stories that
    need to be deemed ‚ÄúDone‚Äù:'

    I‚Äôm still shocked at how badly the software engineering industry is still behind
