    eurozone has long been characterized as a lack of competitiveness between the
    North and the South, which appears to be to be an intractable problem. The solution
    suggested by many non-European analysts has been a full-blown fiscal union and
    federal Europe.

    continue to fall, and in fact unit labor costs have already dropped more than
    10 per cent since the 2010 peak. Given the time lag between changes in the money
    supply and their impact on prices and unit labor costs, he anticipates further
    declines in the latter.
