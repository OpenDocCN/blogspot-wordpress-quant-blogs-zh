- en: There is growing evidence that the stock market is undergoing a rotation from
    large cap technology to cyclical and reflation stocks. Exhibit A is the market
    action of the tech heavy NASDAQ 100, which violated a key rising channel and also
    violated its 50 day moving average (dma). By contrast, the broader S&P 500 is
    testing its 50 dma and only exhibited a minor break.

    new all-time highs, and its performance against the S&P 500 has decisively turned
    up.
