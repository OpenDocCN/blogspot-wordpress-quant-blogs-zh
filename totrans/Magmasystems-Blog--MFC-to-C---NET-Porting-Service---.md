# Magmasystems Blog: MFC to C#/.NET Porting Service???

> 来源：[http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2006/01/mfc-to-cnet-porting-service.html#0001-01-01](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2006/01/mfc-to-cnet-porting-service.html#0001-01-01)

Are people out there still learning C++ and MFC? I can't imagine that they are. If you are a financial services company, and you have a big application written in MFC (let's forget about ATL and WTL right now), how difficult is it for you to find an MFC developer to enhance the application?

Would you pay for a porting company to transform the application into a C#/.NET application? Or, if there was a product available, would you pay for a .NET framework that is quasi-compatible with MFC?

Maybe Finetix will give me some seed money for this!
