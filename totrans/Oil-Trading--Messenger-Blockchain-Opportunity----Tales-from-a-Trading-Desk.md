# Oil Trading: Messenger Blockchain Opportunity? | Tales from a Trading Desk

## Oil Trading: Messenger Blockchain Opportunity?

Interesting read over on [Bloomberg](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-01/oil-traders-may-be-the-only-people-who-want-yahoo-to-thrive), “These May Be the Only People Who Want Yahoo to Thrive”.  I can only assume the oil traders are a niche user of Messenger, given the new Messenger platform has a reduced feature set:

> Yahoo, meanwhile, is forcing new users to an updated platform that compliance officers at some trading houses have declared off limits because the chats can’t be recorded and logged internally

Which leads to a few thoughts for the Oil Traders solution:

1.  Buy Yahoo! Messenger via a consortium 🙂
2.  [Symphony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphony_Communication) Communication
3.  Join the blockchain bandwagon, and follow [Pentagon](http://www.coinfox.info/news/5385-pentagon-to-develop-blockchain-based-millitary-messenger) or [SendChat](http://allcoinsnews.com/2015/05/07/blockchain-messenger-sendchat-launching-blocktrust-crowdfund-10th-may/) with a blockchain backed messenger.  Further, it would allow the Oil Traders to  further integrate the actual contracts into a Distributed Ledger,  offering a future based platform that is compliant +ve.  Chat and contract together in a Distributed Ledge would can only be a win from a Mifid viewpoint 🙂 – unified treatment of clients, trade interaction audit trail, and Organised Trading Facility ([OTF](http://www.nortonrosefulbright.com/knowledge/publications/118316/mifid-ii-mifir-what-it-means-for-commodities-firms)).
