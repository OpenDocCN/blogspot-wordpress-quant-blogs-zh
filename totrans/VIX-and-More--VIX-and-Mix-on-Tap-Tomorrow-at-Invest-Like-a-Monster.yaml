    (Jon Najarian, Pete Najarian, Guy Adami, etc.) is hosting the San Francisco version
    of their [Invest Like a Monster](http://www.optionmonster.com/events/ilam_2010/agenda.jsp)
    conference. Included in Friday’s breakout sessions is Chris McKhann’s “Understanding
    and Trading the VIX” at 11:30 a.m. At 5:30 p.m. is something called “VIX and Mix”
    that is billed as a reception and an opportunity to fire questions at Jon, Pete
    and Guy.
