    in the VIX turns out to be the top in that index. Personally, I think there is

    it is even more likely that the [TED spread](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TED%20spread)
    (which measures the difference between [LIBOR](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/LIBOR)
    rates and the yield on the [3 month U.S. T-Bill](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/3%20Month%20Treasury%20Bill))
    high of last Friday will mark the maximum point of [atherosclerosis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atherosclerosis)

    sign that the global economy is turning the corner. In fear and panic there is
    opportunity; and as we turn the corner, the opportunities are greatest.
