# Magmasystems Blog: What does a Database Architect do?

> 来源：[http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2006/11/what-does-database-architect-do.html#0001-01-01](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2006/11/what-does-database-architect-do.html#0001-01-01)

Even though I was the very first developer on the Microsoft SQL Server Team, I have to admit that databases don't thrill me .... You have to have a special mindset to deal with databases all day, and to tell you the truth, my interests lie elsewhere. In fact, the sure way to get me to fail an interview is to ask me to write any moderately-complicated SQL query.

I firmly believe that, for major systems, the developers should not be allowed to design the data model, set up the databases, nor write the DDL. I have seen a number of instances in the past where systems that have had their database components designed by non-database experts have performed very poorly. Slow queries, no indexes, lock contention, etc. The best projects that I have been involved in have had a separate person just devoted to the database. If I am leading a major project, I will always have a dedicated db expert as part of the effort.

Let's say that we want to hire a database expert for our Architecture Team. What duties would they have?

1) Advise teams on best practices.

2) Come up with DDL coding standards.

3) Review existing systems and provide guidance on performance improvements.

4) Know the competitve landscape (Sybase vs SQL Server vs Oracle) and affect corporate standards.

5) Be expert at OLAP, MDX, Analysis Services, etc.

6) Know how to tune databases and hardware in order to provide optimal performance.

7) Advise all of the DBAs.

8) Monitor upcoming technologies, like Complex Event Processing, time-series databases, etc. Be familiar with KDB+, StreamBase, Vhayu, etc.

A Database Architect is a full-time job that I think that all Architecture groups should have a slot for.

Know anyone who wants to join us?
