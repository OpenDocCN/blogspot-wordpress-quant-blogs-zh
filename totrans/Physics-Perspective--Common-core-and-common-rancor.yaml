    fundamental piece of any education. In the bizarre world of U.S. public schools,
    though, it's proving to be controversial.

- en: For several years, schools across the U.S. -- with significant help from the
    Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation -- have been putting in place something called
    the Common Core, a set of standards on what students from kindergarten through
    12th grade should learn on topics including English, mathematics, science and
    history. Along the way, they’ve faced ample criticism, some of it reasonable.
    Teachers, in particular, think they haven't had adequate preparation.

    I really do believe that. It also turns out that such an opinion is true and well-supported.
    It is a fact that the earth orbits the sun. Thus, the fact/opinion distinction
    is specious. It doesn't tell us anything important about either the facts or the
    opinions involved. Some opinions are about factual matters.

    As in meaningless? Saying that two words are not identical does not imply that
    they therefore refer to opposing, disjoint sets. We may talk about some mathematical
    equations as being beautiful, and others as being true, and agree that truth and
    beauty are not the same thing, but this wouldn't make anyone think that the beautiful
    equations must be false, or that the true equations must be not beautiful. We
    simply have two categories with partial overlap.

    the notion of "fact" from the notion of "opinion" will make them think that there's
    no overlap between the categories, with some opinions being facts, and others
    not. Come on. Kids aren't that silly.
