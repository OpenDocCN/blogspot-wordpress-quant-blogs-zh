    as a real-time indicator of global growth. As well, John Authers recently wrote,
    "The commodity market is a real-time attempt to assimilate geopolitical developments,
    growth fears, and shocks to supply and demand, so it’s an important place to look
    for the next few weeks." So far, commodities have been elevated even as the global
    economy showed signs of slowing. The divergence is attributable to supply shocks.

    global supply chains and caused both a supply shock. As the virus first emerged
    in China, Beijing responded by shutting down the economy and its industrial capacity
    came to a virtual halt. Just as the world began to recover from the COVID Crash,
    the Russia-Ukraine war sparked another supply shock, this time in energy and agricultural
    products.
