## Microsoft Will Unveil New Trading Platform at SIA

Via [FinServ](http://blogs.msdn.com/finserv_blog/archive/2006/06/15/632246.aspx) blog. I spoke to a Microsoft chap about this a while ago, so its nice to see the integration of [Grid Computing and Excel](http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/273943_msftrading15.html) from Microsoft finally making a public appearance. Microsoft still has some way to go in this area, since a number of investment banks have been running Excel spreadsheets on various flavoured grid for the last year. Why would any bank run Excel spreadsheets on a grid? Because traders/quant’s love Excel, and trying to break that link is painful.
