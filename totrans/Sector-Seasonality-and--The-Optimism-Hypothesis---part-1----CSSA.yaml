    Fidelity sector rotation strategy. [http://marketsci.wordpress.com/2010/01/08/kaeppel%e2%80%99s-sector-seasonality-strategy/](http://marketsci.wordpress.com/2010/01/08/kaeppel%e2%80%99s-sector-seasonality-strategy/)

    strong relationship and relevance to the sector seasonality rotation strategy.
    Regardless of whether this is mere coincidence or not, for the current post reader’s
    may refer to the following article :'

    improve upon the traditional seasonality strategy of “Sell in May and go away”
    by keeping continuous exposure with a dynamic sector allocation. In this article
    a long/short sector seasonality strategy is derived that relies on going long
    cyclicals/short defensive stocks in the winter starting at the end of October
    (similar to going long cyclicals like energy for Kaeppel) and long defensive stocks
    short cyclicals in the summer starting in May (cash for Kaeppel and gold towards
    the tail end–also similar to a defensive type strategy). The author reports that
    a market neutral portfolio (long and short) achieved roughly a 7% CAGR with nearly
    80% positive years between 1970-2003, and an even higher return in the later part
    of the sample.

    (or sector seasonality) should occur and also to derive supporting links for the
    effect to ensure that it is not the artifact of clever data mining. The author
    cites the following explantion as **“The Optimism Hypothesis”** and provides some
    supporting evidence in kind:'

- en: '*“We put forward the optimism-cycle hypothesis as a possible explanation for
    the seasonal cycle. In the last quarter of the year, investors start looking forward
    to the next year, but because of an optimism bias they usually overstate the economic
    outlook. This optimism results initially in attractive returns on stocks but a
    few months into the year reality catches up with investors and they become more
    pessimistic resulting in a summer lull on the stock market. In this way, the psychology
    of investors repeatedly makes a fool of them.”*'

    part of the new year up until the spring-when reality begins to “kick in.” The
    interesting supporting evidence came in the fact that analyst estimate revisions
    of earnings followed an identical cycle of optimism in the early part of the new
    year and subsequent downward revisions into the summertime. Furthermore the IPO
    cycle showed an even more powerful relationship with IPO returns being much higher
    in the winter than in the summer–part of this can be linked in with the January
    effect for small-cap stocks. Could this have the same effect in 2010? History
    would show that optimism is in full-force to start the new year and perhaps even
    more so following a large market rally. In Part 2 we will present an ETF-based
    strategy based on the article, as well as a synthesis with Jay Kaeppel’s strategy
    also using ETFs.
