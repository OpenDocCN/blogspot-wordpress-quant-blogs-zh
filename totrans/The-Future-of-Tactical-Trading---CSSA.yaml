- en: 'One has to question the future of quantitative analysis in the age of computers
    and the internet and how it will shape the future of tactical trading. There was
    a time when data was expensive and largely unavailable to all but the largest
    institutions. There was a time when computers were so large that they filled an
    entire room. Few people even had the skills or knowledge to properly execute sound
    quantitative studies. In this brave new era, it seems as if all the PhD talent
    in the world is lining up to offer their services to banks or large hedge funds.
    Computing power has advanced so much that quantitative testing is now available
    to the common man. Today, I can download free data from Yahoo Finance and start
    backtesting in Starbucks and my laptop will generate results almost immediately. The
    barriers to entry for simple testing at least are very low needless to say. To
    think that identifying simple quantitative “effects” will guarantee you success
    in the market these days is more than a little naiive. This begs the obvious question:
    what kind of strategies will work in the future? Perhaps John Maynard Keynes had
    a time machine and was able to see the future of tactical trading when he wrote
    this related piece a very long time ago:'

  zh: 人们必须质疑在计算机和互联网时代，量化分析的未来以及它将如何塑造战术交易的未来。曾经有一段时间，数据是昂贵的，几乎只有最大的机构才能获得。曾经有一段时间，计算机如此之大，它们填满了一个整个房间。很少有人具备正确执行
    sound quantitative studies 的技能或知识。在这个勇敢的新时代，似乎世界上所有的PhD人才都在排队等着向银行或大型对冲基金提供服务。计算能力已经进步到如此程度，定量测试现在对普通人来说也是可用的。今天，我可以从雅虎财经免费下载数据，并在星巴克开始回测，我的笔记本电脑几乎立即就会生成结果。至少可以说，简单测试的入门门槛是非常低的。认为识别简单的定量“效应”将保证你在市场中的成功，这实在是有点天真。这引发了一个显而易见的问题：未来哪种策略会有效？也许约翰·梅纳德·凯恩斯有一个时光机器，他能够看到战术交易的未来，当他很早以前写下这篇相关文章时：
- en: '*“Professional investment may be likened to those newspaper competitions in
    which the competitors have to pick out the six prettiest faces from a hundred
    photographs, the prize being awarded to the competitor whose choice most nearly
    corresponds to the average preferences of the competitors as a whole; so that
    each competitor has to pick, not those faces which he himself finds prettiest,
    but those which he thinks likeliest to catch the fancy of the other competitors,
    all of whom are looking at the problem from the same point of view. It is not
    a case of choosing those which, to the best of one’s judgement, are really the
    prettiest, nor even those which average opinion genuinely thinks the prettiest.
    We have reached the third degree where we devote our intelligence to anticipating
    what average opinion expects the average opinion to be. And there are some, I
    believe, who practice the fourth, fifth and higher degrees.”*'

  zh: '*“专业投资可以比作那些报纸上的竞赛，参赛者需要在一百张照片中选出六张最美的脸，奖品授予选择最接近全体参赛者平均偏好的竞争者；因此，每位参赛者都要挑选的，不是他自己认为最美的脸，而是他认为最有可能吸引其他参赛者的脸，所有参赛者都从相同的角度看待这个问题。这不仅仅是选择那些根据自己的判断最漂亮的脸，甚至也不是选择那些大多数人真心认为最漂亮的脸。我们已经到了第三层，我们用智慧来预测平均预期是什么。我相信有些人实践第四、第五和更高的层次。”*'
- en: What does this all mean? And how will this affect the future? Trading based
    on simple observation of quantitative effects is like picking the prettiest faces
    from the group without considering what everyone else is thinking. What Keynes
    is saying is identical to what happens in competitive poker–they are indistinguishable
    in concept and theory. Drawing from my vast No-Limit Texas Holdem poker experience,
    I can fairly easily create analogies to speculate on the natural progression of
    trading.  You see in poker, at the low and middle levels of play, the winning
    strategy is to play high “edge” hands in high edge situations against amateurs
    that are willing to gamble against you (they choose knowingly or unknowingly to
    play lower edge hands/situations and thus end up losing money to you). At the
    higher levels of poker, where there are a lot of experts and experienced players,
    few of them will make obvious mistakes and rarely will they choose to willingly
    gamble against you in low edge situations.  To win at these levels, you must have
    a strong understanding of the game theory and psychological elements of the game.
    At the higher levels of play, winning comes from understanding your opponent and
    predicting what his actions are likely to be.  The sad irony is that many “newbie mathematical”
    players that are very smart and disciplined show up at these limits and learn
    a very hard lesson.  They lose inexplicably to their often more unsophisticated
    counterparts due to their inability to recognize that knowledge of the odds and
    their edges is less important in this higher level dimension of competition. They
    are trying to win by holding strong hands and try to get paid for them while their
    opponents are all too aware of their intentions. They get bluffed relentlessly
    when the situation warrants, and their opponents only confront them much stronger
    hands.

  zh: 这究竟意味着什么？这将如何影响未来？基于对量化效应的简单观察的交易就像是从一群人中挑选出最漂亮的面孔，而不考虑其他人是怎么想的。凯恩斯所说与竞技扑克中的情况完全相同——在概念和理论上它们是无法区分的。结合我在无限制德州扑克中的丰富经验，我可以很容易地创建类比来推测交易的天然进程。你在扑克中可以看到，在低水平和中等水平的游戏中，获胜策略是对抗愿意与你赌博的业余选手时，在有高优势的情况下玩高“边缘”手牌（他们有意或无意地选择玩低边缘手牌/情况，结果输钱给你）。在扑克的高水平比赛中，有很多专家和有经验的玩家，很少有人会犯明显的错误，而且他们很少会选择在你有低优势的情况下愿意与你赌博。在这些水平上获胜，你必须对游戏的理论和对游戏的心理元素有深入的理解。在游戏的更高水平上，获胜来自于了解你的对手并预测他们可能采取的行动。令人悲哀的讽刺是，许多“新手数学”玩家非常聪明且自律，他们出现在这些水平上，并从中吸取了非常沉重的教训。他们无法解释地输给了通常更为非精英的对手，是因为他们没有意识到在这个更高水平的竞争维度中，了解赔率和他们的优势并不重要。他们试图通过持有好牌并试图从中获益，而他们的对手都太清楚他们的意图了。当情况需要时，他们不断地被虚张声势，而他们的对手只在他们手里有更强的牌时才与他们对抗。
- en: The next level of tactical trading will be to keep an eye on incorporating some
    of these concepts. Many of you who keep an eye on the fundamentals were in shock
    and disbelief at what has happened over the course of 2008-2009\. Historic levels
    of government intervention made discretionary trading in 2008 a terrible minefield
    to those uninitiated in the tactics of deception and game theory.The mismatch
    between market performance and fundamentals wreaked havoc on the many intelligent
    and  knowledgeable market players. Many quantitative strategies that performed
    well in previous years (estimate revisions, dividend yields, valuations, earnings
    acceleration, balance sheet ratios) went out the window in this environment as
    well. What one has to understand is that when the stakes are high—such as the
    threat of the dissolution of the entire financial system—one is no longer operating
    at the poker table with the mere amateurs or even unsophisticated institutions.
    The last 2 years have been a high stakes game with the most sophisticated and
    powerful opponents of all–the big banks and the federal reserve. Make no mistake,
    these players know what you will think, and take great pains to influence you
    into making the choices they want you to make. **In 2010, keep this in mind as
    the great “bull market” as we know it may turn out to be one of the biggest bluffs
    of all time, put on by the pros**. The creeping treasury yields are a faint sign
    that not all is well in wonderland. They want you to believe the worst is over,
    and that the future is bright. Understanding this motivation, you can more easily
    understand their future actions.

  zh: 战术交易的下一个层次将是关注整合这些概念。许多关注基本面的交易者在2008-2009年间发生的事情感到震惊和难以置信。政府前所未有的干预使得2008年的主观交易对那些不懂欺骗和博弈论战术的人来说，就像一片充满陷阱的雷区。市场表现与基本面的背离使得许多智力高超且知识丰富的市场参与者陷入了混乱。许多在过去几年表现良好的量化策略（如估计修订、股息收益率、估值、盈利加速、资产负债表比率）在这种环境下也失效了。需要理解的是，当风险很高时——比如整个金融系统解体的威胁——你不再是在扑克桌上与业余选手或甚至是不成熟的机构玩游戏。过去两年是一场高风险的游戏，对手是最复杂、最强大的——大型银行和美联储。不要误会，这些玩家知道你会怎么想，并竭尽全力影响你的选择，让你做出他们希望你做出的决定。**在2010年，要牢记这一点，因为我们所知道的“牛市”可能最终被证明是史上最大的骗局，是由专业人士一手炮制的**。逐渐上升的国债收益率是仙境一切并非都好的微弱信号。他们希望你相信最糟糕的已经过去，未来一片光明。理解这种动机，你更容易理解他们未来的行动。
- en: 'Regardless of what time frame you operate in, or what instruments you choose,
    you should start asking yourself every day: a) who are my opponents, and how will
    I extract my edge? b) if my opponents are sophisticated, what do they want me
    to think in order to turn things to their advantage? Is this intraday breakout
    real, or just a trap designed to take my money? The implication for tactical trading
    is twofold: 1) If you want to play against sophisticated opponents, mere knowledge
    of obvious strategies is not enough–you must think at the second and third levels.
    2) If you want to play against unsophisticated opponents, you must have a quantifiable
    edge. One of the easiest ways to adjust your trading is to stick to areas that
    are likely to contain comparatively unsophisticated opponents such as the smaller
    capitalization stocks. Another is to operate in the liquid markets where your
    sophisticated opponents cannot easily manipulate things against you and may even
    tip their hands–this occurs in the longer time frames in the form of  long-term
    trends and relative momentum (relative strength). Lastly, if you do plan on confronting
    the big boys, try to do the opposite of what they want you to do–this means buying
    weakness and selling strength–and this is why mean-reversion strategies and the
    DV2/RSI2 have been so successful in an increasingly sophisticated market, especially
    when trading them according to the longer-term trend.'

  zh: 无论你在哪个时间框架内操作，或者选择哪种工具，你应该每天开始问自己以下问题：a)我的对手是谁，以及我将如何获取我的优势？b)如果我的对手很聪明，他们想让我怎么想才能把事情变成他们的优势？这种日内突破是真的，还是只是一个陷阱，旨在骗取我的钱？对于战术交易来说，这意味着两方面：1)
    如果你想和聪明的对手交易，仅仅了解明显的策略是不够的——你必须思考第二层和第三层。2) 如果你想和不太聪明的对手交易，你必须有一个可量化的优势。调整交易的最简单方法之一就是坚持可能包含相对不太聪明的对手的区域，比如小市值股票。另一种是在流动性市场中操作，在那里你的聪明对手不能轻易地对你进行操纵，甚至可能露出马脚——这发生在较长的时间框架内，形式为长期趋势和相对动量（相对强度）。最后，如果你确实打算面对大玩家，试着做他们希望你做的事情的相反——这意味着买入弱势股和卖出强势股——这就是为什么均值回归策略和DV2/RSI2在日益复杂的市场上如此成功，尤其是在按照长期趋势交易它们时。
