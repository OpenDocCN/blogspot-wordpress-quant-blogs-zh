    and the internet and how it will shape the future of tactical trading. There was
    a time when data was expensive and largely unavailable to all but the largest
    institutions. There was a time when computers were so large that they filled an
    entire room. Few people even had the skills or knowledge to properly execute sound
    quantitative studies. In this brave new era, it seems as if all the PhD talent
    in the world is lining up to offer their services to banks or large hedge funds.
    Computing power has advanced so much that quantitative testing is now available
    to the common man. Today, I can download free data from Yahoo Finance and start
    backtesting in Starbucks and my laptop will generate results almost immediately. The
    barriers to entry for simple testing at least are very low needless to say. To
    think that identifying simple quantitative “effects” will guarantee you success
    in the market these days is more than a little naiive. This begs the obvious question:
    what kind of strategies will work in the future? Perhaps John Maynard Keynes had
    a time machine and was able to see the future of tactical trading when he wrote
    this related piece a very long time ago:'

    which the competitors have to pick out the six prettiest faces from a hundred
    photographs, the prize being awarded to the competitor whose choice most nearly
    corresponds to the average preferences of the competitors as a whole; so that
    each competitor has to pick, not those faces which he himself finds prettiest,
    but those which he thinks likeliest to catch the fancy of the other competitors,
    all of whom are looking at the problem from the same point of view. It is not
    a case of choosing those which, to the best of one’s judgement, are really the
    prettiest, nor even those which average opinion genuinely thinks the prettiest.
    We have reached the third degree where we devote our intelligence to anticipating
    what average opinion expects the average opinion to be. And there are some, I
    believe, who practice the fourth, fifth and higher degrees.”*'

    on simple observation of quantitative effects is like picking the prettiest faces
    from the group without considering what everyone else is thinking. What Keynes
    is saying is identical to what happens in competitive poker–they are indistinguishable
    in concept and theory. Drawing from my vast No-Limit Texas Holdem poker experience,
    I can fairly easily create analogies to speculate on the natural progression of
    trading.  You see in poker, at the low and middle levels of play, the winning
    strategy is to play high “edge” hands in high edge situations against amateurs
    that are willing to gamble against you (they choose knowingly or unknowingly to
    play lower edge hands/situations and thus end up losing money to you). At the
    higher levels of poker, where there are a lot of experts and experienced players,
    few of them will make obvious mistakes and rarely will they choose to willingly
    gamble against you in low edge situations.  To win at these levels, you must have
    a strong understanding of the game theory and psychological elements of the game.
    At the higher levels of play, winning comes from understanding your opponent and
    predicting what his actions are likely to be.  The sad irony is that many “newbie mathematical”
    players that are very smart and disciplined show up at these limits and learn
    a very hard lesson.  They lose inexplicably to their often more unsophisticated
    counterparts due to their inability to recognize that knowledge of the odds and
    their edges is less important in this higher level dimension of competition. They
    are trying to win by holding strong hands and try to get paid for them while their
    opponents are all too aware of their intentions. They get bluffed relentlessly
    when the situation warrants, and their opponents only confront them much stronger
    hands.

- en: The next level of tactical trading will be to keep an eye on incorporating some
    of these concepts. Many of you who keep an eye on the fundamentals were in shock
    and disbelief at what has happened over the course of 2008-2009\. Historic levels
    of government intervention made discretionary trading in 2008 a terrible minefield
    to those uninitiated in the tactics of deception and game theory.The mismatch
    between market performance and fundamentals wreaked havoc on the many intelligent
    and  knowledgeable market players. Many quantitative strategies that performed
    well in previous years (estimate revisions, dividend yields, valuations, earnings
    acceleration, balance sheet ratios) went out the window in this environment as
    well. What one has to understand is that when the stakes are high—such as the
    threat of the dissolution of the entire financial system—one is no longer operating
    at the poker table with the mere amateurs or even unsophisticated institutions.
    The last 2 years have been a high stakes game with the most sophisticated and
    powerful opponents of all–the big banks and the federal reserve. Make no mistake,
    these players know what you will think, and take great pains to influence you
    into making the choices they want you to make. **In 2010, keep this in mind as
    the great “bull market” as we know it may turn out to be one of the biggest bluffs
    of all time, put on by the pros**. The creeping treasury yields are a faint sign
    that not all is well in wonderland. They want you to believe the worst is over,
    and that the future is bright. Understanding this motivation, you can more easily
    understand their future actions.

    you should start asking yourself every day: a) who are my opponents, and how will
    I extract my edge? b) if my opponents are sophisticated, what do they want me
    to think in order to turn things to their advantage? Is this intraday breakout
    real, or just a trap designed to take my money? The implication for tactical trading
    is twofold: 1) If you want to play against sophisticated opponents, mere knowledge
    of obvious strategies is not enough–you must think at the second and third levels.
    2) If you want to play against unsophisticated opponents, you must have a quantifiable
    edge. One of the easiest ways to adjust your trading is to stick to areas that
    are likely to contain comparatively unsophisticated opponents such as the smaller
    capitalization stocks. Another is to operate in the liquid markets where your
    sophisticated opponents cannot easily manipulate things against you and may even
    tip their hands–this occurs in the longer time frames in the form of  long-term
    trends and relative momentum (relative strength). Lastly, if you do plan on confronting
    the big boys, try to do the opposite of what they want you to do–this means buying
    weakness and selling strength–and this is why mean-reversion strategies and the
    DV2/RSI2 have been so successful in an increasingly sophisticated market, especially
    when trading them according to the longer-term trend.'
