    the Percent Exposure Donchian Channel Method mentioned in my earlier Quick Take
    article on the subject.  I will make the more detailed and nicely-presented PDF created
    by Corey available shortly.  For now I will present a brief summary. As a point
    for new readers–Quick Take articles are simply ideas to help inspire system developers that
    I have not had a chance to test.  Thus, I had no idea whether the system would
    actually work in practice.  Nonetheless,  the system concept was designed based
    on  sound logic and theory–which is a key ingredient in system design. Corey created
    a  summary of the results for the last 25 years tested on the following futures
    markets: ES, NQ, TF, GC, SI, HG, CL, HO, NG, RB, ZC, CC,CT, KC,ZW, LE, HE, ZS,
    SB, GBP, AUD, JPY, EUR, CHF. This is essentially a diversified basket of stock
    indices, commodities, currencies and fixed income futures which helps to verify
    robustness.'

- en: The annual returns of nearly 13% are fairly solid and likely superior to any
    buy and hold benchmark. The sharpe ratio of .83 is very solid, especially for
    a trend following strategy. Returns soared to 50% in 2008 while the world was
    melting down—displaying the positive kurtosis of trend-following strategies. 
    Looking at the system from a risk-adjusted perspective, the Percent Exposure model
    shines. This is to be expected, as bet-sizing is adjusted for the channel breakout
    length and whether a trade is going with or against the long-term trend. A standard
    deviation of 14% is lower than both the S&P 500 and the commodity index. Furthermore,
    the max drawdown of 31% is lower than typical trend following strategies that
    trade both long and short. The worst month of -12% was tolerable even as a hedge
    fund strategy. The worst year of -13% was also very low for a trend-following
    strategy. The equity curve was very smooth with an R-squared of 88%, but becoming
    a little choppier in recent years as mean-reversion has become the dominant strategy.
    Finally, the system seems to be effective across a very wide range markets–especially
    on the long side.

    that the  Percent Exposure Donchian Channel system is 1) fairly robust 2) a good
     risk-adjusted trend following system. There are several ways to improve upon
    it, while still keeeping robustness intact. Here are some suggestions:'

- en: 1) Combine the Percent Exposure system with two momentum systems:   **RS Momentum:**
     Buy only the top 3 markets ranked by a combination of 12-month price return and
    1-month price return (12month rank + 1month rank)/2 .  **Contrarian Momentum:** 
    For a contrarian bent, you could buy the bottom 3 markets ranked by 3-year price
    return.  Note that for short signals you would reverse this criteria for both
    momentum and contrarian. This should raise the returns on an absolute and risk-adjusted
    basis.

- en: 2) Use a trend and volatility filter:  Only take signals if the ADX is greater
    than 25 or 30\. Or you can use the R-squared of closing prices over the last 20
    days as a proxy with a minimum value of 50%. As a volatility filter, only take signals
    if the 10-day ATR/ 10-day average price is below the 50th percentile over the
    last year. *A signal is triggered only if it meets both of these criteria.* These
    numbers have been chosen arbitrarily, but parameter testing should help you find
    more suitable thresholds.
