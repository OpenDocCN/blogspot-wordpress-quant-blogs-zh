    the VIX closed at 39.81.

- en: Before anyone gets excited about the possibility of the VIX back in the 30s,
    I should note that the [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures)
    continue to reflect expectations of a rising VIX over the course of at least the
    next 2-3 months. Today’s VIX January futures settled at 44.18 and the February
    futures settled at 45.08\. Futures for August through October are now priced in
    the 37-38 range, however, suggesting that volatility expectations are being lowered
    for the second half of 2009.
