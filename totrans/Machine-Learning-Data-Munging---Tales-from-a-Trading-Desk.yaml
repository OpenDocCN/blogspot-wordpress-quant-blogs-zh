    set of data which you can explore and understand missing linkages, and data holes.
     Option 2 in my view is possibly a little more difficult, as you are essentially
    defining the data set prior to actually getting any real data from the source
    system(s).

    attempt to visualise the data attributes that may aid the machine learning engine.
     I’ve gone though a number of mind mapping tools, which mostly free (and possibly
    part of the issue), have in some shape of form felt restricted, or lack an appropriate
    user interface 🙂

    but it does offer the ability to link concepts and label the links. XMind is graphically
    a lot easier on the eye, but once you start down the road of adding relationships
    to your mindmap, things get a bit messy.  At the end of the day, they are very
    different tools, aiming to tackle different problems, but they are helpful in
    exploring the data set that needs to be ingested into the AI engine
