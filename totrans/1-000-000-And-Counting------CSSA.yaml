    Sure, it is about equivalent to a popular James Altucher post, but to me it is
    a major milestone, and I would like to thank all of the readers who have supported
    this blog over the last few years- even when I took long breaks from posting to
    spend time working at my various day jobs. Writing this blog has been a labor
    of love so to speak. It has also given me back a lot more than all the free intellectual
    property and concepts or ideas I have shared. I have met so many different talented
    people, and been exposed to work in many different and interesting areas of the
    investment industry.

    things to myself and maximizing their market value– I would tell them that I if
    I had to do it all over, I would absolutely do it again. We are entering a new
    era where sharing and collaboration will (and already has) build more value than
    guarding and monopolizing information. The collective and the team will triumph
    over the individual. Gone are the days of worshipping gurus on CNBC, and instead
    we have a marketplace where smart people with access to technology can create
    quantitative systems that can potentially put to shame some of the best human
    portfolio managers. But to be able to build a sustainable edge requires a strong
    and open research culture, and effectively integrating the diverse talents of
    multiple individuals.

    as I can. And since I am still somewhat young and somewhat foolish, I have plenty
    of time and potential to improve. If there are topics that you find especially
    interesting that I have not yet covered- or covered in enough detail- please leave
    me with some ideas in the comments section. As always, I would encourage anyone
    who wants to share their work with some of the ideas presented with me as I would
    be more than happy to post them on this blog.
