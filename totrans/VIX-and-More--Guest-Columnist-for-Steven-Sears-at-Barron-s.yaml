- en: It may just be a coincidence, but each time I have been tapped as a guest columnist
    for *The Striking Price* on behalf of Steven Sears at [Barron’s](http://online.barrons.com/),
    there has been a spike in volatility just as I sit down to draft some thoughts.
    Perhaps Steven knows something I don’t, but if he does, he’s not telling.

    I build on some themes from a previous September column, [Will Market Volatility
    Return to Crisis Levels?](http://online.barrons.com/article/SB50001424052970204297404575493863568455090.html)
    and discuss why I think those who have been earning a nice living by selling options
    steadily for the past two years or so may still be able to carry that strategy
    forward.

    in [The Nature of Risk](http://www.amazon.com/Nature-Publishing-Library-Contrary-Opinion/dp/0870341324/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpt_2).
    As that graphic has never appeared on the blog, I have decided to include it below
    for reference.
