- en: a framework to decompose the implementation shortfall cost of a realized trading
    schedule into a cost component due to the projected general market movement and
    trades of other market participants, and a cost component capturing the impact
    of own trades. We then present a methodology that simulates alternative hypothetical
    trading strategies and optimizes the client’s trading aggressiveness. The gains
    from accommodating the intraday alpha patterns of the fund managers’ executions
    lead to a significant reduction in the trading costs both in- and out-of-sample
    in most scenarios.
