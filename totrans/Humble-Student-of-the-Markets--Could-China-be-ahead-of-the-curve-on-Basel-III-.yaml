- en: Bank lending is concentrated on local government financing vehicles, the infrastructure
    sector and big corporations. With the speeding up of structural economic adjustments,
    there is clearly a rising possibility of loan losses. The quality of loans to
    the property industry is currently still sound. But we need to be on high alert
    as to the impact of property price fluctuations on such loans. The NPL ratio of
    credit card loans is rising rapidly and the potential risks demand attention.
    By the end of 2009, bad credit card loans reached 7.8 billion yuan, up from 3.5
    billion yuan a year earlier. The NPL ratio of such loans stood at 2.8 percent.

    requirements in line with the Basel Accord. China will open up the banking sector
    in a timely manner and actively attract foreign financial firms that will help
    the country to better serve small businesses and agriculture and to boost domestic
    consumption.

    in exports and support domestic firms venturing abroad" and the banking system
    is fragile, then something must be done to ensure that banks don't drag the system
