    the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    had shifted significantly some time during Q2 or Q3 2020\. The old Big Three leaders
    of US over non-US stocks, growth over value, and large-caps over small-caps had
    made unmistakable trend reversals. Recently, even as the S&P 500, the Dow, and
    the Transports made fresh all-time highs, leadership was shifting back. US equities
    are dominant against non-US again; NASDAQ stocks are enjoying a minor revival;
    and small-caps are faltering against their large-cap counterparts.
