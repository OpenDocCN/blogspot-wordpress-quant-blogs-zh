    to equities, so overload on those equities with the highest betas in order to
    get more equity exposure. The paper looks at both levered ETFs, and options (from
    1996-2010).  Here's a graph showing the embedded leveage (aka omega) in options,
    and monthly returns.

    worse the more out-of-the-money they go. These are horrible long investments (large
    negative returns to out-of-the-money aka AntiFragile options)

- en: I don't really see how this comports with their theory, however, because if
    investors want more access to the equity factor, they are getting extremely negative
    returns. Thus, it really isn't a rational theory of constrained optimization,
    but delusional speculation.  Further, investors are acting the same to puts and
    calls, and constraints on access to short positions doesn't seem to make sense
    in their model unless they have heterogeneous (and persistently wrong) beliefs.
     So, the idea that rational, constrained, investors explains this effect doesn't
    make any sense.  Perhaps they can explain.
