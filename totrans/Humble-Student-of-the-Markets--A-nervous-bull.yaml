    conditions now are similar to the last time the Timer Model issued its buy risk,
    or inflation signal, last September just after Bernanke's Jackson Hole QE2 speech.

    pattern. Last time, cyclicals were in a relative downtrend but they were in a
    constructive pattern of a triangle formation showing higher lows. Today, cyclical
    stocks are in a relative downtrend and they are approaching a key relative support
    zone. A breakdown below relative support would be a negative divergence.

    As I pointed out before, the banking sector has broken down below an key relative
    support level and remains in a relative downtrend. Past instances of important
    violations of relative support is an indicator of high systemic risk in the financial
    system, i.e. the Russia Crisis of 1998 and Subprime Crisis of 2007\.

    and it's time to jump on that momentum. The last time this happened, it sparked
    a significant intermediate term rally in the market.

    system, these concerns were also present last September as well, when the BKX
    was also in a relative downtrend. Given these conditions, my inner trader tells
    me to give the bull trade the benefit of the doubt, but maintain tight stops in
    order to limit my downside risk. In other words, I am a nervous bull.
