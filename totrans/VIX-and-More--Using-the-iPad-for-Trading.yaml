    ([AAPL](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/AAPL)) have their facts wrong,
    today the [iPad](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/iPad) 2 will arrive
    at my door step.

    that I have no idea what I will ultimately end up interacting with. This could
    turn out to be new computer in a different form factor a toy or anything in between.

    is going to happen either. I am not a big fan of using my [iPhone](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/iPhone)
    for trading unless my environment does not allow any alternatives. As for the
    iPad, I can imagine it as a complement to my main trading setup, an excellent
    portable alternative to the iPhone and perhaps filling a bunch of other roles
    that I am not able to anticipate.

    trading, whether it means news, charts, quotes, trade execution or whatever. If
    I get enough responses of note – either here or on Twitter ([http://www.twitter.com/VIXandMore](http://www.twitter.com/VIXandMore))
    – I will summarize the information in a future post and add in my own experiences
    as well.
