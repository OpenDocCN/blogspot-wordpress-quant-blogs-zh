- en: Playing around with [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/index.html) recently –
    travel helps with time allocation 🙂  I’ve blogged about Python usage in financial
    services a number of times before, but not the specific usage of Pandas.  Pandas
    is great for data analysis applications – looking at the [LFPUG](http://blog.enthought.com/general/lfpug-python-in-the-enterprise-pandas/)
    blog posting from Oct 2012, AHL (“Moving an algo business from R and Java to Pytho”)
    also thinks so.  Unfortunately I can’t seem to find Mr Pilsworth LFPUG presentation,
    but a quick Google for Pandas, coupled with reading between the lines of various
    financial job vacancies provides a view as to what is happening on the ground.

- en: '[Wes](http://wesmckinney.com/blog/?p=687) offers a 2011 financial [presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/wesm/python-for-financial-data-analysis-with-pandas),
    “Python for Financial Data Analysis with pandas”, which provides some insight. 
    I’d also suggest reading Wes’s [book](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023784.do)
    on Data Analysis.The skew by the Sell (bank) side server community to Java, and
    lesser Scala, should probably consider a new look at Pandas for certain types
    of application solution.'
