- en: '**Mid-week market update**: It''s always instructive to see how the market
    reacts to the news. If I had told you that the dual market nightmare scenarios
    of a contested election and a deadlocked election consisting of a Biden Presidency
    and a Republican-controlled Senate were to come true, would you expect the market
    to take a risk-on or risk-off tone?'

  zh: '**中期市场更新**：观察市场如何对新闻作出反应总是富有教益的。如果我告诉你，双市场噩梦场景——一场有争议的选举和一场僵局选举（包括拜登总统和共和党控制的参议院）将成为现实，你会预期市场采取风险偏好还是风险规避的立场呢？'
- en: Based on publicly available reports, Biden is on his way to the White House.
    If he were to win all the states that he is leading in, Biden would win the Presidency.
    As well, the Republicans have retained control of the Senate, which puts the idea
    of a Blue Wave sweep to rest. That said, the presidential election is very close
    and subject to challenge. The likelihood of a contested election that winds up
    in the courts, and the streets, is high.

  zh: 根据公开可获得的报告，拜登正朝着白宫前进。如果他赢得了目前领先的所有的州，拜登将赢得总统大选。同时，共和党保留了参议院的控制权，这让蓝色浪潮横扫一切的念头得以平息。话说回来，总统选举非常接近，并且存在争议。最终可能诉诸法院甚至街头的争议选举的可能性很高。
