# Humble Student of the Markets: On the verge of a long-term buy signal

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2023/07/on-verge-of-long-term-buy-signal.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2023/07/on-verge-of-long-term-buy-signal.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models** 

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post, 

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The 

**Trend Asset Allocation Model**

 is an asset allocation model that applies trend-following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity prices. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. The performance and full details of a model portfolio based on the out-of-sample signals of the Trend Model can be found

[here](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/trend-model-report-card/)

.

My inner trader uses a 

**trading model**

, which is a blend of price momentum (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa). Subscribers receive real-time alerts of model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of the email alerts is updated weekly 

[here](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/trading-track-record/)

. The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that began in March 2016 is shown below.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Sell equities (Last changed from “buy” on 26-Mar-2023)*
*   Trend Model signal: Neutral (Last changed from “bullish” on 17-Mar-2023)*
*   Trading model: Neutral (Last changed from “bearish” on 15-Jun-2023)*

** The performance chart and model readings have been delayed by a week out of respect to our paying subscribers.***Update schedule**

: I generally update model readings on my

#### A likely buy signal ahead

Regular readers know that I apply the monthly MACD crossover as a way of determining long-term buy signals. The model works this way:

*   Buy when the monthly MACD histogram changes from negative to positive.
*   Sell the market exhibits a negative 14-month RSI divergence.

The month isn’t over yet, but when this model is applied to the broadly based NYSE Composite, it is on the verge of a buy signal, with the caveat that it’s never a good idea to front-run model readings. Significant market strength on Monday, which is the month-end, could tip the model reading into buy territory. Otherwise, the model should flash a buy signal in August barring a major pullback.

This model has performed well on an out-of-sample basis. It was timely in flashing a sell signal in late 2018\. It bought back into the market in 2019 and sold just as the market topped in early 2020\. It turned bullish again in late 2020 and became bearish in early 2022\.
The history of past buy signals has usually indicated relatively long-lived bull runs with only minor drawdown risk.
