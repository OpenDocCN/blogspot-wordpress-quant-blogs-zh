- en: Earlier in the week, I looked at the decreasing volume in VIX options in [Interest
    in VIX Waning?](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/02/interest-in-vix-waning.html)  Over
    the course of my analysis, I attributed some of the decline in VIX [options](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20options)
    to the launch of [QID](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/QID) (and SDS)
    options back in November.

    for those looking at leveraged hedging opportunities, a much bigger factor has
    been the meteoric rise in interest in options for [XLF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLF),
    the financial sector SPDR.

- en: As the graphic below demonstrates, XLF options were not actively traded until
    July 2007.  After a surge in interest in mid-summer, volume dropped off until
    November, at which time implied volatility and options volume both rose dramatically.  By
    means of comparison, back in June 2007, XLF and VIX options traded in roughly
    equal numbers, but so far in 2008, XLF options volume has been outpacing VIX options
    volume by about five to one.  Additionally, I find it noteworthy that a there
    has been a sustained increase in XLF options volume since the beginning of November
    – the same time that VIX options volume peaked and started to decline.

- en: There are several other features of the XLF implied volatility chart that are
    worth pointing out.  One of which is that implied volatility and options volume
    have moved in almost perfect lockstep over the past six months.  Another point
    of interest is that XLF implied volatility peaked just as the major indices bottomed
    in January.  A break below the current 35 support level might signal a lessening
    of put activity in the financial sector and perhaps indicate that the January
    bottoms are a good bet to hold.
