    [OxyPlot](http://oxyplot.org "OxyPlot") is a well designed interactive scientific
    plotting library.  The library renders to iOS, Android, Mono.Mac, GTK#, Silverlight,
    and WPF.    If one is dealing with a manageable amount of data, highly recommend
    [Bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/ "Bokeh") & python.   However if you
    need significant interactive functionality or need to interact with large data
    sets, OxyPlot is a great solution:'

    wanted to build a UI to allow me to observe and develop better intuitions around
    order book characteristics.   OxyPlot did not have good financial charts, so contributed
    high-performance interactive candlestick & volume charts that can handle millions
    of bars (points) and some pane alignment controls to the project.   Here is an
    example of the sort of UI one can put together with OxyPlot:'
