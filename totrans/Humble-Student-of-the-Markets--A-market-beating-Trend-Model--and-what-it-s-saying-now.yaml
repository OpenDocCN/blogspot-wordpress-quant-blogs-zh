    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    recap that post, I have been publishing the signals of my Trend Model since 2013\.
    A simulated portfolio which varied the equity allocation based on those out-of-sample
    signals significantly beat a passive 60/40 benchmark, and on a consistent basis.
    In particular, the simulated portfolio was able to cushion some of the drawdowns
    during bearish equity episodes. The study was a proof of concept that the Trend
    Model can add value to an asset allocation process.
