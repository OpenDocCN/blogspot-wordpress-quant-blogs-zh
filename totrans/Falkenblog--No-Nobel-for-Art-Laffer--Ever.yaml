    on labor dynamics. Basically, if you have people with unknown productivity searching
    for jobs, they should not take the first job offered; firms should fire those
    people with below-average productivity. That's a good insight. Too often people
    look at the unemployed as a homogeneous lot, who are affected by labor demand
    like plankton affected by the tides.

    and second order effects offset each other, making their relevance an empirical
    matter. Thus, wage subsidies, minimum wages, laws making it difficult to fire
    employees, have ambiguous effects on society. Mortensen's

    Again, a good idea.

    then decreasing in tax rates, on a cocktail napkin, when arguing about the president
    Gerald Ford's tax increase (ie, 1974). This too is a good idea. This too, is an
    empirical issue, as we can be either at a point where revenue is increasing in
    the marginal rate, or decreasing. Even if the curve is increasing, its slope is
    important, especially because maximizing government revenue is not the same as
    maximizing societal welfare.

    has the same empirical limitations as the modeling of labor search on unemployment
    or any of the other economics Nobels. If you think Laffer's point is too uncertain
    to be Nobel-worthy, you are putting to much confidence in the Nobel brand (they

    models. The models are no more predictive or instructive than the Laffer curve,
    just they lend themselves to infinite amounts of rigor so it can then it looks

    has been really bad for understanding economic systems. The Laffer curve is marginalized
    by economists for its unpretentious honesty, whereas the dynamic general equilibrium
    search models are more misleading as to how precise they are or can be. This makes
    economics less fruitful.
