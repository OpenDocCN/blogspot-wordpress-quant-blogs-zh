    picked the low hanging fruit in stem cell therapies. After all, while Bush limited
    the Federal funding of several embryonic stem cell lines, states were free to
    fund them (and did), as well as private and foreign governments. In other words,
    this is not a field devoid of attention.'

- en: The difference between embryonic and adult stem cells is mainly theoretical,
    that because embryonic cells are from prior to much tissue differentiation, they
    should be more plastic than adult stem cells. In practice, adult and embryonic
    stem cells behave rather similarly, and the hidden premise of proposals for stem
    cell therapy is that we needn't understand exactly what is going on because if
    you just put the cells in the right place they will know what to do (the

    was wrong to restrict this research. But I also think he is assumed to have way
    too much power, because it is not like he stamped out closely related research,
    and there have always been other areas that would allow and fund embryonic stem
    cell research. Sure, '
