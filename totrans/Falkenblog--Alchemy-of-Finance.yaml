    Unless one can identify the characteristics of an upward bias, as in contrast
    to a downward bias, that is just a description of asset price fluctuations. That
    an efficient market researcher would say the asset price has a return equal to
    the risk free rate plus white noise, is observationally equivalent.'

    does not work. Only if one is offering a theory on the particulars of a bubble
    ex ante, without hindsight. Otherwise, its just another lament on our inability
    to predict price declines.

    to insolvent banks, which creates a multiplier effect. But many models have that
    mechanism, where a crisis in confidence create self-fulfilling implosions. I think
    Soros'' own experience pushing down the pound during the 1992 European Union currency
    crisis makes him think this is a bit more radical than it sounds. There are ''bear
    raids'', and these happen, but they usually happen only when there is fundamental
    weakness. That is, Soros selling the pound in 1992, or John Paulson selling mortgages
    in 2007, would not have worked if these assets were not also inherently overvalued
    at that time. I think he gives his correct calls too much credit in creating their
    own success, as opposed to ''merely'' forecasting them.'

    can create what they predict needs more structure. It's plausible, and surely
    every price bubble has its share of enthusiastic bulls on the way up and bears
    on the way down. But it is not clear to what degree they are conspicuous statistical
    correlates irrelevant to the process.

    Of course, it's a high standard, a Big Idea, as there aren't a lot of new, true
    and important ideas out there.
