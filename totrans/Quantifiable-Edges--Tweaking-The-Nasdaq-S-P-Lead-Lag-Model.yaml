    with RSI). I changed it slightly for my purposes and instead of tracking the Nasdaq
    vs. the NYSE, I instead tracked the Nasdaq vs. the S&P 500\.

    at it from one angle. Today I’m going to explore a couple of other ideas that
    the indicator / model may have invoked in many of you. I’ve also updated the spreadsheet
    so that you can see how these ideas were tested as well.

    over time. So if owning the S&P when the Nasdaq is leading is so favorable, does
    that mean you should short the S&P when the Nasdaq is lagging?

    the black. Certainly this isn’t an equity curve that suggests an edge. While some
    may be surprised based on how positive the previous results were, it makes complete
    sense. The strategy in this chart calls for shorting the leading index. I don’t
    believe I’ve ever seen anyone who has suggested that to be a good idea.

    It is the leader after all.

    you earn 2.5% interest on your cash balance is about 13%. This is more than twice
    the S&P 500 annual growth rate of under 6% for the period. There’s also lower
    drawdown and you’d only be in the market a little more than half the time.

    big difference. Here you see that a small tweak to ensure you’re in the leading
    index can juice returns much, much more. There are numerous other tweaks you could
    add to the model to improve performance or reduce drawdowns further. This is as
    far as I’m going to take it, though. The spreadsheet is still available and updated
    with the above tests and charts. You may download the updated version
