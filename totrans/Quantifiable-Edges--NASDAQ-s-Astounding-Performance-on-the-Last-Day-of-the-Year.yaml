    used to be a bullish day for the market it seems to have changed over the last
    decade into a seasonally bearish day. I looked at performance across a number
    of indices last night and found the tendencies to be fairly consistent. Below
    is an updated equity curve for the NASDAQ Composite on the last day of the year.
    Its results easily stood out the most.

    abrupt end to the apparent edge. I am not yet ready to fully label the last day
    as bearish, but it should certainly no longer be considered bullish. I have no
    good explanation for why this may have changed, but it obviously has.

    changing. It is important to always keep studying it, keep an open mind, and adapt
    as it evolves. Best to all in 2012! I hope it is a prosperous year for you and
    I hope Quantifiable Edges proves helpful along the way!
