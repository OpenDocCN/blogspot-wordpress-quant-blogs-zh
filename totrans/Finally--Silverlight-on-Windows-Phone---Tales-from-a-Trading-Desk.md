## Finally, Silverlight on Windows Phone

But, when will we get [Silverlight](http://www.andybeaulieu.com/Home/tabid/67/EntryID/192/Default.aspx) on the iPhone? It took Adobe long enough to get Flash on the iPhone, surely [Microsoft](http://www.windowsphone7series.com/) will have to follow with Silverlight?
