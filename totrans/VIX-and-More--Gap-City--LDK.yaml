    the subject of [accounting fraud allegations](http://www.thestreet.com/_yahoo/newsanalysis/energy/10394949.html?cm_ven=YAHOO&cm_cat=FREE&cm_ite=NA)
    by a former controller that helped to knock the stock down from the mid-70s to
    the mid-20s over the course of a month or so.  On Monday, [LDK reported](http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/071217/aqm072.html?.v=26)
    that the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors had finished their review of
    the matter and concluded that there had been no wrongdoing.  Things were looking
    up until LDK [reported quarterly results](http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/071219/aqw100.html?.v=27)
    after the close yesterday.  The numbers were generally in line, but [concerns
    about margins](http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/071220/ldk_solar_out_of_the_gate.html?.v=1)
    and the absence of raised guidance has put pressure on this stock this morning,
    which traded down as much as 27% earlier in the session.

    is littered with gaps and the tombstones of overzealous traders.  If you are thinking
    about playing solar roulette, consider that directional plays are extremely dangerous.  One
    way to make to potentially make some money off of the faddish momentum and wild
    gyrations is to sell volatility below support and above resistance, so you can
    get paid while you watch the fun.  Even if you don’t play this stock, the entertainment
    value alone makes it worth keeping an eye on.

    counterpart [JA Solar Holdings (JASO)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=jaso)
    think of a hockey mask every time they look at the ticker?  Given the volatility
    in that stock, somehow it seems an appropriate image…
