## Technical Debt

Design [Smells](http://www.designsmells.com/article.php?id=2) offer a single page on technical debt.  One of the key causes of technical debt often overlooked compared to the other items listed is “schedule pressure”.  Lack of understand of basic software engineering by stakeholders often means that teams are driven down a road where the only outcome can be technical debt, which in itself leads to other issues 😦
