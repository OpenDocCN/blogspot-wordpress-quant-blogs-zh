# Magmasystems Blog: Welcome, Patric

> 来源：[http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2008/07/welcome-patric.html#0001-01-01](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2008/07/welcome-patric.html#0001-01-01)

My

CEP

team is happy to welcome Patric, a very experienced developer who specializes in

UI

design.

Our GUI is shaping up very nicely. We made the decision to go to

WPF

, and under Scott's leadership, the GUI is starting to come together nicely. We have been getting a lot of oohs and

aahs

on the trading floor, and the buzz that the GUI is generating will hopefully give us space on the traders' screens.

We have just about reached the point where people stopped wondering what our row on the trading floor has been up to. We are now starting to get requests from different groups, which is a position that we were hoping that we would be in. As many people have said about

CEP

, once you show people what you can get from a

CEP

infrastructure, your next set of problems is how to balance all of the requests that you will get.
