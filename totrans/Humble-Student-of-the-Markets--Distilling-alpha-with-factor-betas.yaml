    go wrong with your strategy?" If he doesn't know, then it's a sign that he hasn't
    fully thought out all the nuances of his investment approach.

    with an idea for a bond strategy for the Canadian market. The idea involved overlaying
    a call option writing strategy on the US Treasury market on top of a Canadian
    bond portfolio. The resulting portfolio had the following benefits:'

    a year. The backtest looked good as it added an alpha of over 3% in that period.
    Given my assessment of his risk exposures, I wanted to see whether the outperformance
    was the result of a favorable factor beta exposure, i.e. the strategy bet on a
    certain kind of exposure and it worked, or the alpha was relatively independent
    of factor beta.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I averaged the weekly alpha of the strategy under different scenarios. On the
    first line, I asked, "What is the average weekly alpha when the US long bond price
    is up, down or relatively flat?" In that case, the strategy underperformed when
    the long bond rallied, largely because it was selling call options at the long
    end of the yield curve and the premiums weren't enough to offset the gains in
    bond prices, and outperformed when the long bond price was either flat or falling.

- en: Similarly, I performed other forms of scenario analysis. What happens to the
    alpha when the Canada and US curve diverge? What happens when implied stock volatility
    (I didn't have a good proxy for bond volatility) moved up or down?

- en: I used scenario analysis to project an annual alpha. The average case analysis
    assumes a Gaussian distribution where 50% of the time exposure to that factor
    beta is neutral, 25% of the time it is favorable and 25% of the time unfavorable.
    Using the example of the long bond price factor, I calculated an expected alpha
    assuming that 25% of the time, the bond price was falling, 25% of the time it
    was rising and 50% it was neutral. In this case, that came to an expected alpha
    of 3.90% per annum.

    with us?

    33% unfavorable and 16% favorable. Using the example of the long bond price factor,
    the expected alpha came to 0.80% per annum.

- en: What happens if a catastrophic scenario? In the third column labelled "Worst
    Case", I assigned weights of 2/3 neutral, 1/3 unfavorable and 0 favorable. (Remember
    that these are weekly alphas and it would be difficult to believe that, in the
    case of the long bond price, it would fall for a single week in an entire year
    and would be rallying 17 weeks out of 52 weeks in the year.) The expected alpha
    in the worst case analysis for the long bond price factor came to -2.13%.

- en: Putting it all together, the strategy looked pretty good. We could expect an
    alpha in the order of 3.0-3.6% a year - which is an astounding figure for a bond
    portfolio. In a typical bad year, we could still expect outperformance of 0.8%
    to 1.8%. If the roof caved in and everything went wrong, alpha deteriorated to
    between -2.1% and a positive 0.2%.

    using scenario analysis with factor betas. This is another way of asking the question,
    "What can go wrong with the investment strategy and how badly could things fall
    apart?"

    but for business ones.
