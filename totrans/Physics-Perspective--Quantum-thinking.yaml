    connections between the mathematics of quantum theory and patterns of human decision
    making. I don't want to say too much more here, but would like to clarify one
    very important point and give some links.

    session held by the European Commission. Participants were supposed to be bold
    and propose radical visions about where the most promising avenues for research
    lay in the near future (this was in the context of information and computing technology).
    One Belgian researcher gave a fascinating talk on the application of quantum mathematics
    to human decision making, claiming that quantum logic fits actual human behaviour
    more closely than does classical logic. There are many famous "anomalies" -- such
    as the

    when making decisions of economic importance. The Belgian researcher explained
    that the quantum formalism is able to accommodate such behaviour, and was therefore
    surprisingly useful in understanding how people organize and use concepts.

    greeted this suggestion, while completely mis-understanding what the man had said.
    One physicist came close to screaming that this was "embarrassing mumbo jumbo"
    somehow linked to the idea that quantum physics underlies brain function (the
    idea proposed over a decade ago by Roger Penrose in his profound book

    physicist had actually pointed out that he wasn't at all suggesting that quantum
    physics plays a role in the brain, only that the mathematics of quantum physics
    is useful in describing human behaviour.

    of Hilbert spaces) isn't identical with the theory and somehow owned by it, but
    stands quite independent of that theory and existed for at least a century before
    quantum theory was invented. The Belgian was saying -- this mathematics which
    turned out to be so useful for quantum physics is now turning out to be profoundly
    useful in quite another setting.

    psychology and computer science. The second author Dominic Widdows is a computer
    scientist at Google working on information retrieval. The paper essentially argues
    that philosophers historically devised classical logic and then took it as a model
    for what human logic must be or at least should be. They suggest this was the
    wrong way around. Pure logic isn''t our best example of reasoning. The best example
    of reasoning systems is people, and so a logic of what reasoning is and can be
    ought to start with people rather than mathematics. This is a powerful idea. As
    the authors put it:'

    are (and can be). Such a view one finds, for example in [Gabbay and Woods, 2001]
    and [Gabbay and Woods, 2003b], among logicians, and, also in the social scientific
    literature [Simon, 1957, Stanovich, 1999, Gigerenzer and Selten, 2001b]. Here
    the leading idea of the “new logic” is twofold. First, that logic’s original mission
    as a theory of human reasoning should be re-affirmed. Second, that a theory of
    human reasoning must take empirical account of what human reasoners are like –
    what they are interested in and what they are capable of.'

    is, it is more similar to quantum logic than to classical.

    and information retrieval. Here the idea is that if people create concepts and
    texts and organize them using a quantum-style logic, then search methods based
    on classical logic aren't likely to search such conceptual spaces very effectively.
    This paper describes applications in which literature search can be improved by
    using quantum logic operations. Most interesting (and I did mention this in the
    New Scientist piece) is the use of quantum operations to generate what might be
    closely akin to "hunches" or "guesses" about where in a mass of textual data interesting
    ideas might be found -- guesses not based on logical deduction, but on something
    less tightly constrained and ultimately more powerful.
