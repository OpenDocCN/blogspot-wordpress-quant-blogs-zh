# VIX and More: Chart of the Week: Emerging Markets

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/05/chart-of-week-emerging-markets.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/05/chart-of-week-emerging-markets.html#0001-01-01)

One of my best trades for 2009 has been a long position in [EEM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EEM), the [emerging markets](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/emerging%20markets) ETF. The [chart of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week) below shows that emerging markets have been consistently outperforming the S&P 500 index since the beginning or January (see ratio study at top of chart) and was one of the first major equity groups to top its [200 day simple moving average](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/200%20day%20SMA) (dotted green line) in late April. While the SPX has been going sideways during May, emerging markets have continued to tack on gains, bolstered by rising prices for [commodities](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/commodities).

I would not be surprised to see EEM finding increasing resistance at several stages in the 34-40 range, but for now at least, I see no reason to exit EEM at least until its performance relative to the SPX begins to falter.

***Disclosure****: Long EEM at time of writing.*
