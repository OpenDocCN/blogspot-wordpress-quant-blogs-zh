# VIX and More: More Record Lows in the ISEE

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/02/more-record-lows-in-isee.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/02/more-record-lows-in-isee.html#0001-01-01)

I haven't bothered posting about the [ISEE](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/ISEE) lately not because nothing of interest is happening with that index, but because the story hasn't changed. In fact, the ISEE has set new record lows in the 20 day simple moving average for the past two days and the 50 day SMA for the past three days.

The VIX may look placid, but be careful not to conclude too much from that one data point. Options buyers may not be panic-buying puts and driving up volatility readings, but their relative interest in buying calls vs. puts is much lower than it ever has been during the six years for which the ISE has published ISEE sentiment data.

As I mentioned [a month ago](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/01/when-volatility-and-put-to-call.html), history suggests that the markets usually struggle after we have a lackluster VIX combined with investors who are reluctant to buy calls.
