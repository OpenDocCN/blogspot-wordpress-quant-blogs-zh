- en: The 'myth' of the rational markets suggests a straw man argument in practice,
    a position no one argues, but popular discussion and pandering authors discuss
    endlessly. If you think rationality implies perfection or an absence of market
    declines you are wrong, so don't waste too much time on this precious insight;
    it's like discovering that nature AND nurture affect IQ.

- en: It is important to remember that while academics, almost exclusively economists,
    believe some form of market efficiency, most non-economists don't. Back in the
    1970s and 80s when index funds were being introduced, most leading magazines lambasted
    the idea, noting how stupid an index fund was because people like Warren Buffet
    or Peter Lynch proves this is suboptimal. Thus, John Bogle (head of Vanguard)
    had to fight to get his board to accept an index fund, and this while he was CEO!
    Even today index funds are a small portion (about 15%, depending on how you count
    it) of equity investors.

- en: ), I note that unlike Efficient Markets Hypothesis, which has never been popular
    with regular people, the Capital Asset Pricing Model has been warmly regarded
    since inception. The picture above shows the cover of Institutional Investor magazine
    in 1971 discussing 'The Beta Cult' as if it were a done deal. The first empirical
    confirmation had yet to even be published! Of course, this confirmation (by Black,
    Jensen and Scholes('72), Fama and MacBeth ('73), and Blume and Friend('73)) was
    spurious, meticulously correcting for 'errors in variables', but totally blowing
    it on the omitted variable of size, which itself proxied measurement error issues
    related to delistings.

- en: Why does the CAPM and its derivatives get such a better reception than the Efficient
    Markets Hypothesis? Both rely on rational investors, though they are independent
    theories (neither implies the other). I think the efficient markets hypothesis
    plays into an easier caricature, which is unfortunate because as a guideline the
    implication of the EMH is a much better approximation of reality than the CAPM
    (or its spawn the SDF or APT approaches). That is, no measure of risk linearly,
    positively, relates to returns as a first approximation. In contrast, most investors
    lose money the more they trade, and their deviations from the market do not, on
    average, have alpha. See a small discussion from my

    perfect, have fun taking on idiosyncratic risk for an extra 100 basis points a
    year. Way to stick to those smug economists.
