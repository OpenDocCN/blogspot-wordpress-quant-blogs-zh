# Why Microsoft should buy JetBrains | Tales from a Trading Desk

## Why Microsoft should buy JetBrains

In the Java world, [IntelliJ](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) rules in my view. Even with Visual Studio 2005 new [refactoring](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnvs05/html/VS05_refac.asp) support, to be truely productive you still need [ReSharper](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/). If Microsoft still can’t understand the concept of refactoring in 2006, then maybe its time for them to give in, accept they will never build a decent IDE, and buy JetBrains to resolve the issue.

On the subject of [Visual Studio 2005](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/), I understand the need for Microsoft to charge more for the [Team System](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/teamsystem/products/compare/default.aspx) versions compared to Professional, but why did they have to only add [integrated](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/products/compare/) support for FxCop, Unit Testing and Code Profiling into Team System? Surely these are features every developer should use as standard – yet another reason why Microsoft to buy JetBrains.
