    a eurozone debt crisis and political impasse in Washington, the A-D Line did breach
    an uptrend line, but rallied to make a new high shortly after. The shallow correction

    Management. “Not only is property important because it’s a key component of that
    investment boom, but it’s essentially the asset that underwrites all credit in
    the Chinese economy, whether it’s local government loans, whether it’s business
    loans,” Chovanec says, explaining that lenders require “hard” assets as collateral
    because financial accounts can easily be doctored.

    between the economic trends and the small seasonal impact. The Great Recession
    has been followed by a slow and plodding recovery. We have an extended business
    cycle with plenty of central bank support. Since I am expecting the current cycle
    to feature (eventually) a period of robust growth, I do not want to miss it. The
    1% seasonal effect will be minor in a month where we get a real economic surge.

    do not become bona fide patterns until they are triggered. The bearish trigger
    is a breach of neckline support, which is at about the 4000 level. Should that
