# Timely Portfolio: Approaching the Zero Bound - Bonds

> 来源：[http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2013/01/approaching-zero-bound-bonds.html#0001-01-01](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2013/01/approaching-zero-bound-bonds.html#0001-01-01)

As bonds approach the artificial zero bound, where do we go next especially after the record setting +30% in 2011?  The rolling 250-day total return has rarely gone negative since the inception of the Vanguard Funds VBMFX and VUSTX.  I am intentionally an ex-bond fund manager, so I am very interested.
