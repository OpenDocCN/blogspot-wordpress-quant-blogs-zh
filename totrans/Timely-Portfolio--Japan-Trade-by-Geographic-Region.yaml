- en: To further the analysis presented in [Japanese Trade and the Yen](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2012/03/japanese-trade-and-yen.html),
    I thought I would take the more granular data provided by the Japanese Ministry
    of Finance on trade by geographic region.  Of course, I will use R to read, analyze,
    and plot the .csv data.  Below you will see there are only two remaining regions
    where Japan has a trade surplus (North and South America), and those surpluses
    are declining very rapidly.
