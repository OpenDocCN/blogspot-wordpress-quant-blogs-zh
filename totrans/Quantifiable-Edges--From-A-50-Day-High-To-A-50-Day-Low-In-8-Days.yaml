- en: Amazingly, Thursday’s close marked a 50-day low in the S&P. It was just last
    week that the S&P closed at a 50-day high. Moving from a 50-day closing high to
    a 50-day closing low so quickly is quite rare. I only found 6 other instances.
    Unfortunately, while it appears rare, it doesn’t appear predictive. Below is the
    stats table.

    the dates of each instance in case anyone else would like to have a closer look.
