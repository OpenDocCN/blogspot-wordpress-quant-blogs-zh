    options expirations calendar](http://www.theocc.com/publications/xcal/xcal2008.pdf)
    [which is pinned at the bottom of the "VIX & Sentiment Links" in the upper right
    hand corner of the blog] has some unusual features that are the result of the
    timing of Good Friday, which falls on expiration week in March this year.

- en: Without getting into all the details, the bottom line is that the *expiration
    day* for February's VIX options is ***Tuesday***, February 19^(th), instead of
    the usual Wednesday.  With the President’s Day holiday falling on Monday the 18^(th),
    this moves the *last trading day* in VIX options up to ***Friday***, February
    15^(th) – the day after tomorrow. Note that the same expiration and last trading
    dates also apply to [VXN](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXN) and
    [RVX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/RVX) options.
