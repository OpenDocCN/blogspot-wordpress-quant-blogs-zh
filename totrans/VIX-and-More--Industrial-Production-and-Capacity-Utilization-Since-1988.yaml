    surprise in both the July [industrial production](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/industrial%20production)
    and July [capacity utilization](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/capacity%20utilization)
    numbers yesterday, both of which exceeded expectations and topped the June levels.

- en: The chart below captures both measures of manufacturing activity going back
    to 1988 and shows that manufacturing appears to be continuing as one of the strengths
    of the recovery. While the chart captures monthly changes, it is important to
    point out that total industrial production in July was 7.7% above July 2009 levels,
    with utilities up 8.2% during the year, followed by 7.7% gains in manufacturing
    and a 7.5% advance in mining. Just as impressive, capacity utilization has increased
    in 12 of the past 13 months, gaining 0.7% in July after a flat June.
