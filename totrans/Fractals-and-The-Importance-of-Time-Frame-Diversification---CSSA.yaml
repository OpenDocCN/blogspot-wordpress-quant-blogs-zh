- en: Investors and traders often take a one-dimensional view of time frames in the
    stock market. The media pundits often refer to the fact that it is a “bull” or
    “bear” market as if there was only one time frame required to make such an assertion.
    Contrast that with the fact that both traders and investors operate on widely
    varying time frames from minutes to years, and that a person’s preferred time
    frame can change with the market itself. People often talk about the 200-day moving
    average or a 10-month moving average as if the market must operate and will continue
    to operate on such cyclical frequencies. And let us put aside for now the obvious
    “observer effects” that cause seminal shifts in historically validated behavior.
    The success of any moving average strategy is often just an artifact of the market
    environment itself rather than any special pattern in market behavior. In roaring
    bull markets, most moving average strategies that are less than 1 year in length
    will look silly in relation to buy and hold. In a falling market, most moving
    average strategies less than 1 year will look smart.

  zh: 投资者和交易员经常在股市中对时间框架有一维观点。媒体评论员经常把它称为“牛市”或“熊市”，好像只需要一个时间框架来做出这样的断言一样。对比一下，交易员和投资者在从分钟到年的不同时间框架上进行操作，而一个人喜欢的时间框架可以随市场本身的变化而改变。人们经常谈论200日移动平均线或10个月移动平均线，好像市场必须在这样的周期频率上运行并将继续按照这种规律运行。现在我们先不考虑那些导致历史验证的行为发生了重大变化的明显的“观察者效应”。任何移动平均线策略的成功往往只是市场环境本身的产物，而不是市场行为中的任何特殊模式。在繁荣的牛市中，大多数少于1年的移动平均线策略看起来都很傻，相对于买进持有。在下跌市场中，大多数少于1年的移动平均线策略看起来很聪明。
- en: Even within such periods such as roaring bull markets of the 1990s that were
    less kind to long-term moving average systems, there were highly predictable short-term
    and even intra-day trends. The reverse has been true of the last several years,
    where short-term trends and intra-day trends have either been mean-reverting or
    very noisy and difficult to trade. The problem lies with our tendency to think
    of the market as operating in one particular time frame. But this is dangerous
    not just for trading, but also for generating any statistical input for factor
    models or optimization as well. Financial time series data is so noisy that the
    risk of ignoring multiple time frame information is even more significant.

  zh: 即便是这样的时期，例如1990年代繁荣的牛市并不太适合长期移动平均系统，但是其中也存在着高度可预测的短期甚至是日内的趋势。过去几年情况恰恰相反，短期和日内趋势要么是回归均值的，要么非常嘈杂和难以交易。问题在于我们倾向于认为市场在一个特定时间框架内运行。但是这不仅对交易是危险的，对于生成任何统计模型的输入或优化也是危险的。金融时间序列数据非常嘈杂，忽略多个时间框架信息的风险甚至更加重要。
- en: 'The reality of time series data is that it shares much in common with fractals
    that can appear very different as you look at smaller or larger pictures. A fractal
    chart can have near infinite total length which is a bounded only by the divisibility
    of time frames for trading. A trend is therefore in the eye of the observer: if
    I consider the coastline of Britain to represent a fractal chart, my impression
    of the shape of Britain depends on whether I look up close or from afar. Assuming
    that there are several thousand scales from which I could observe the coastline,
    if I was placed randomly in only one scale (or time frame) I could mistakenly
    conclude that the next bend would be to the right versus to the left by extrapolating
    from my own narrow point of view. The probability that I would make a correct
    guess would be nearly random. However, if I could place different observers to
    looks dozens of scales at once and simultaneously, with proper co-ordination I
    could make an informed judgement that would be better than random. If those different
    scales contain variable degrees of noise, then different scales will be more informative
    than others. The meta-optimized integration of scale information will then further
    improve my odds of success especially if scale noise in non-stationary.'

  zh: 时间序列数据的现实是，它与分形图有许多共同之处，当你从不同大小的视角观察时，它们会呈现出不同的外观。 分形图的长度几乎是无限的，仅受交易时间框架的可分性限制。
    因此，趋势是观察者的主观看法：如果我认为英国的海岸线代表一个分形图，我的对英国形状的印象取决于我是近距离观察还是远距离观察。 假设我可以从数千个不同的尺度观察到海岸线，如果我只被随机放在一个尺度（或时间框架）上，我可能会错误地推断下一个转弯是向右而不是向左，仅仅根据我狭隘的观点推断。
    我做出正确猜测的概率将几乎是随机的。 然而，如果我可以同时把不同的观察者放在多个尺度上观察，通过适当的协调，我可以做出比随机更好的判断。 如果这些不同的尺度包含变化程度不同的噪声，那么某些尺度将比其他尺度更具信息性。
    尺度信息的元优化整合将进一步提高我的成功率，尤其是在尺度噪声是非平稳的情况下。
- en: If this example seems a touch philosophical, I would urge you to think deeper
    and consider the implications of what this means for trading and investing. At
    the very least to me it implies that we must all trade multiple time frames, and
    be prepared to favor some more than others differently at different times. It
    also means that statistical inputs should contain numerous time frames for measurement
    spanning from high-frequency to daily, two-day, weekly etc. If we make no a priori
    assumptions about time frame preference then we should set up measurements like
    returns,volatility, and correlations for example to be parameterless and straddle
    a wide range of possibilities to avoid overfitting.

  zh: 如果这个例子似乎有点哲学意味，我想要敦促你深入思考，考虑这对交易和投资意味着什么。 至少对我来说，它意味着我们必须在多个时间框架内交易，并准备在不同的时间以不同的方式偏爱一些框架。
    这也意味着统计输入应包含从高频到每日，两天，每周等多个时间框架的测量。 如果我们对时间框架偏好不做任何先验假设，那么我们应该设置像回报，波动率和相关性等参数无关，并且跨越一系列可能性以避免过度拟合。
