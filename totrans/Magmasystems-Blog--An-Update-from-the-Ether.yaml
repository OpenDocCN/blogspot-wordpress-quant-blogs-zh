    as I would like to. But, I just wanted to let everyone (if there is anyone left)
    what I am up to.

    for my company. It brings me into some new technologies which I have not been
    exposed to before, and will reunite me with some old ones that I haven't touched
    in 20 years (Linux).

- en: A nice thing about my company is that I can be fairly agile in my role. One
    day I am managing ten people and developing pricing tools for the Equity Derivatives
    desk, and the next day, I am flying off across the Atlantic to interview vendors
    and pouring over SOWs. One thing that I am always happy about is that I will always
    be coding to some extent.
