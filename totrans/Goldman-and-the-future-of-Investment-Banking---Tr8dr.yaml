- en: Some of the dealing on Wall Street falls under the category of being legal but
    unscrupulous.   That said, it is little different from the buying and selling
    that a used car dealer does.   The dealers products have to be approached with
    a buyer-beware mentality for better or worse.

    price.   Necessarily the dealer cannot reveal what she perceives to be the real
    value in buying merchandise and likewise will sell the merchandise for the highest
    price possible.

    about 9B$ in market value.   My view is this reaction is much overdone (hence
    I am long at the -12% level).   Beyond the civil case there are concerns about
    possible regulations such as:'

    to deal in the restricted products will not have access to depositors insurance
    and fed funds apparently.

    and/or unwillingness on the part of gov lenders to provide capital for over-leveraged
    firms.

    time, margins for these trades will drop significantly.    It will, however, open
    up new algo markets.

    they appear will disadvantage retail banks and less sophisticated players, and
    hand more of the market to investment banks such as Goldman.   It will take a
    long time to play out, but I see Goldman winning here.
