    relegated to the most junior person on the team. This is an enormous mistake.

    have seen over the years, the difference in ten-year returns between the first
    quartile and the median manager for a US large cap S&P 500-like mandate has varied
    between 0.8% to 1.5%. You can make all the right picks, get your portfolio construction
    and risk control right and easily lose it all in trading. (Admittedly this example
    is somewhat extreme as the spread between median and first quartile managers tend
    to be much higher in other kinds of mandates but I am just trying to prove a point
    here.)

- en: What about the costs of not trading? Many years ago one institution used to
    base the bonus of the trading desk on the difference between the execution price
    and VWAP. As a result, the traders tried very hard to buy only on the bid and
    sell only on the ask. The executed prices against VWAP looked great, but very
    little of the order got done. In the case of the said institution, friction developed
    between the portfolio managers and the trading desk as a result of this mis-aligned
    incentive system.

- en: A more holistic way of approaching the trading cost measurement is to run a
    parallel paper model portfolio. Put in the changes to the portfolio when you decide
    to buy or sell and measure the returns of the paper portfolio against the actual
    portfolio. The difference is implementation cost. The problem with this approach
    is that it does not disaggregate costs.

    of their trades) should probably be patient and buy only on or below the bid price
    and sell on or above the ask price. On the other hand, if you have fast breaking
    information (a mining company had a big strike or a biotech’s has just announced
    results on one of their drugs) buying on the bid and selling on the ask is the
    wrong thing to do.
