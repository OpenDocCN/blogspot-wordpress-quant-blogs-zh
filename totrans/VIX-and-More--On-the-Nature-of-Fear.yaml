    cage.  It spikes up, but rather than spiking down, it tends to slowly subside
    over time.

- en: In the stock market, there are many factors that may spook investors.  In the
    future I am considering trying to construct a formal Taxonomy of Fear, but for
    now, let me offer some examples.  In the global political arena there are fears
    that range from terrorism, nuclear proliferation, Middle East tension, and a war
    in Iraq that could spiral out of control, to the spread of socialism in South
    America, [China](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/China) playing hardball
    with the renminbi, [Russia](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Russia)
    throwing their weight around with energy and natural resources, etc.  On the macroenomic
    front, is it inflation or deflation we should be more concerned about?  Throw
    in the possibility of a recession, productivity declines and a hiccough in the
    job creation engine and there is the potential for a stagflation stew.  Really
    want to make it nasty?  Add a dollop of bird flu or SARS on the health front,
    sprinkle in some peak oil talk and the possibility of another large hedge fund
    or two imploding and you can see how emotionally charged the investment horizon
    can appear.

    headlines day after day after day.  Whether or not the reality of the situation
    is worsening, play in the media will manage to keep these issues in the headlines
    and top of mind for the investment community – and with it, a sense of fear.

    in particular, tend to persist for decades, with relative visibility ebbing and
    flowing over time.  For the most part, economic fears and health fears are not
    going to be quelled in the short-term either.  At best, they may come and go in
    cycles and even if they do fall off of our radar, new concerns are likely to bubble
    up to take their place.

    too many unsettling events -- or even one event of seismic proportions -- result
    in the piercing of the comfort threshold of the average investor, then echoes
    start to show on the tape and fear cannot be put back in the cage.

- en: The data make this clear.  The VIX, which in some respects resembles fear, is
    seven times more likely to spike up three standard deviations in one day than
    to spike down; it is fifty times more likely to trade three standard deviations
    above its 10 day moving average than below it.  Asymmetrical VIX spikes are not
    just an issue of frequency, but one of degree too.  On the 26 days that the S&P500
    has fallen by 3% or more in a single day, the VIX has spiked up an average of
    16.8%.  Conversely, on the 33 days in which the S&P has risen 3% or more, the
    VIX has fallen only 9.2% on average.

    spikes reverting to the mean within a week or so, but a better understanding of
    the taxonomy of fear and of important fear thresholds is critical to assessing
    when to fade the trend and when to ride it.
