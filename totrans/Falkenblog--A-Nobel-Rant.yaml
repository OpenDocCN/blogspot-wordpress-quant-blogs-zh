- en: A Nobel Prize means that you did something really well appreciated. With hindsight,
    some of these are found positively harmful (note Edgar Moniz's Nobel for the lobotomy),
    and many are just irrelevant (what great insights today do we use from, say, Myrdal,
    Leontief, or Lewis?). Unfortunately, it is the best brand name in academia, so

- en: 'is ok if you have a Nobel. A lot of things were unique to that period: Jim
    Crow laws, the Korean War, fear of nuclear death, Elvis...I suppose they all caused
    the prosperous 1950s. I''m not sure what, specifically, he thinks was a good policy:
    the separation of Investment Banking from commercial banking? That has been shown
    irrelevant looking at cross-country analysis, and even in this latest crisis,
    it was not investment/commercial bank hybrids that did much different. Perhaps
    he''s talking about the various Securities acts of 1934 and 43, which basically
    made brokers sign statements with their addresses, and noting they understood
    parochial laws that forbid stealing and fraud (who knew?).'

    blaming WW2 on Franklin D. Roosevelt. Its long history, from the Depository Institutions
    Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980, to the Garn–St. Germain Depository
    Institutions Act of 1982, to Tax Reform in 1986, created a problem that was not
    anticipated by either party very well. But they started in the Carter administration.

    and by the hands-off attitude of regulators who didn’t believe in regulation —

  zh: 银行家们通过消除传统限制的立法和监管机构不干预的态度，被解放出来，进而大幅放宽了贷款标准。
- en: He seems to forget that the regulators were actually punishing banks that did
    not lower their standards sufficiently. To meet Community Reinvestment Act goals,
    and goals set forth at the Justice Department, banks had to get more loans into
    minority groups, and the easiest way to do that was to lend with no money down
    based on the incorrect, but widely held assumption that housing prices, in aggregate,
    would not go down. Regulators were encouraging this, so to the degree there would
    have been 'more regulation', it would have only been worse.

  zh: 他似乎忘记了监管机构实际上是在惩罚那些没有降低标准的银行。为了实现《社区再投资法》的目标，以及司法部制定的目标，银行必须将更多贷款提供给少数族裔群体，而最简单的方法就是根据错误但被广泛认可的假设，即房价总体上不会下跌，无需首付就能贷款。监管机构鼓励这样做，因此可以说，如果当时“更多监管”，只会使情况变得更糟。

    who are for helping humanity, seek what is true. Those who disagree with him are
    selfishly motivated (unlike, say, union members or bureaucrats), or plain stupid.
