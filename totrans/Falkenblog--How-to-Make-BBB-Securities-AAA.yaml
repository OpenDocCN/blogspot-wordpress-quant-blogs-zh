- en: ', there was a question how a portfolio of BBB rated securities can generate
    a AAA rated security. Ex-Goldman exec Dan Sparks basically said it was due to
    diversification. This is an incomplete answer. Diversification alone is insufficient.
    You also need to add an equity tranche, a first-loss position that is breached
    only in specified probabilities. This is modeled based on historical loss rates
    for the rated collateral, and the minimum amount of equity needed to imply the
    Senior securities have expected loss rates consistent with AAA ratings (expected
    loss is the expected default rate times the loss in event of default). This is
    modeled using Monte Carlo methods because these structures have waterfalls where
    reserves build-up and are paid down, so they don''t assume ''gaussian'' distributions.'

- en: So, turning B rated bonds into AAA rated bonds, involves both diversification
    and equity. You can't turn $100 worth of BBB bonds into $100 worth of AAA bonds.
    You turn it into $95 worth of AAA bonds (or something, depending on the time horizon).

    that's a separate issue.
