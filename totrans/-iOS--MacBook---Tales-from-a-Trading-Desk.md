# “iOS” MacBook | Tales from a Trading Desk

## “iOS” MacBook

Interesting read over on OSNews about the [death](http://www.osnews.com/story/29402/Apple_s_A10_Fusion_benchmarking_and_the_death_of_macOS) of macOS.  In many ways this could be the solution to Apple being rid of [Intel](http://www.theverge.com/2016/9/16/12939310/iphone-7-a10-fusion-processor-apple-intel-future).

On macOS, maybe its a numbers game – iOS, watchOS, and tvOS vs macOS?
