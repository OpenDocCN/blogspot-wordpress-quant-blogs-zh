    on the ‘[flash crash](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/flash%20crash)’
    with the title of [Findings Regarding the Market Events of May 6, 2010](http://www.sec.gov/news/studies/2010/marketevents-report.pdf).

    of some of what happened during a day in which the Dow Jones Industrial Average
    fluctuated some 1138 points.

    below shows what happened to [IWM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/IWM),
    the highly liquid ETF for the Russell 2000 index. IWM trades more than 60 million
    shares per day and is regularly one of the most active issues traded. Up until
    2:43 p.m. ET, IWM was acting normally. Then as the price (dashed line, right scale)
    began to accelerate downward, liquidity (green and blue bands, left scale) suddenly
    began to dry up. By 2:46 p.m., market depth (the height of the green and blue
    bands) in IWM had almost completely disappeared. Over the course of the 74 minutes
    left in the normal trading session, liquidity began to return slowly to the markets.
    At the time the markets closed, approximately 60% of the normal market depth from
    earlier in the day had returned to IWM.

    [ACN](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/ACN), [PG](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/PG),

    [AAPL](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/AAPL), [GE](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/GE)
    and IWM beginning on page 91 of the PDF. If anything, the action in IWM is the
    least extreme of the group.
