    it is perhaps appropriate to watch other asset classes for clues to equity market
    direction, especially on a day when the FOMC made its monetary policy announcement.

    USD. As the chart below shows, the USD Index has weakened after making a high
    in December. It is now testing a key support zone, as well as a Fibonacci retracement
    level. Despite the pullback, the uptrend remains intact.

    correlation with the USD. As well, I show the price of gold and its rolling correlation
    to the USD. The correlation charts show that the relationship between the USD
    and these two assets have been remarkably stable. The USD has been positively
    correlated to interest rates, as measured by the 2-year UST yield, and inversely
    correlated to gold prices.

    a negative correlation. In the past few months, stock prices have risen when gold
    fell, and vice versa.

    to the USD in the wake of the Fed announcement?

    but soon bounced back. The same could be said of interest rates, and stock prices.

    stock market direction. Equities are mildly oversold, but my metrics of risk appetite
    remains in an uptrend. I am inclined to give the bull case the benefit of the
    doubt, but with reservations.
