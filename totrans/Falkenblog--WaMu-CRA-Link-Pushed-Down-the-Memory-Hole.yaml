    encouraging reckless subprime lending the whole way down. Maybe they didn't cause
    the crisis, or they were not even one of the larger of several causes, but they
    were not arguing for stricter underwriting standards during the height of subprime
    lunacy. Even today, the only place you can get a home loan with only

    on Capitol Hill Monday, suggests his problem was a lack of resources, remember,
    they had over 300 people looking at only two institutions, and were not saying
    anything about the novel, lower underwriting standards (eg, income verification,
    credit history, down payments, etc.). If they had 3000 people, they would not
    have done anything about the weakest link in Fannie's subprime initiatives.

    because "The firms would not engage in any activity, goal fulfilling or otherwise,
    unless there was a profit to be made. Fannie and Freddie invested in subprime
    and Alt A mortgages in order to increase profits and regain market share." Further,
    "OFHEO made it very clear to both enterprises that safety and soundness was always
    a higher priority than the affordable housing goals." Yet there is no evidence
    they ever mentioned underwriting standards prior to 2007 as a concern. He seems
    to be saying that because these activities made money prior to 2007, and everyone
    was doing it, it was not risky. That's like saying you are against hangovers,
    but saw no evidence of such effects while you were on your seventh beer--you were
    just keeping up--so your strategy was unrelated to the ensuing hangover.
