- en: that "affordable housing goals" had absolutely nothing to do with their failure,
    because "The firms would not engage in any activity, goal fulfilling or otherwise,
    unless there was a profit to be made. Fannie and Freddie invested in subprime
    and Alt A mortgages in order to increase profits and regain market share." Further,
    "OFHEO made it very clear to both enterprises that safety and soundness was always
    a higher priority than the affordable housing goals." Yet there is no evidence
    they ever mentioned underwriting standards prior to 2007 as a concern. He seems
    to be saying that because these activities made money prior to 2007, and everyone
    was doing it, it was not risky. That's like saying you are against hangovers,
    but saw no evidence of such effects while you were on your seventh beer--you were
    just keeping up--so your strategy was unrelated to the ensuing hangover.

  zh: 的说"经济适用住宅目标"与他们的失败丝毫无关，因为"这些企业不会参与任何活动，不管是目标实现还是其他事情，除非可以盈利。Fannie和Freddie投资于次级按揭贷款和Alt
    A抵押贷款，目的是增加利润和恢复市场份额。"此外，"OFHEO曾向两家企业明确表示，安全和健全一直是高于经济适用住宅目标的重要程度。"可是，没有证据表明他们在2007年之前曾提到过放贷标准是一项担忧。他似乎是在说，因为这些活动在2007年之前赚钱了，并且每个人都在这么做，所以并不算是冒险。这就像说你反对宿醉，但喝了七杯酒后并没看到任何迹象导致宿醉，你只是跟上大家而已，所以你的策略与随后的宿醉无关。
