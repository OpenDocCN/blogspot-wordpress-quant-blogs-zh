# Ontology in Financial Solutions | Tales from a Trading Desk

> 来源：[https://mdavey.wordpress.com/2013/09/05/ontology-in-financial-solutions/#0001-01-01](https://mdavey.wordpress.com/2013/09/05/ontology-in-financial-solutions/#0001-01-01)

Many years ago I was involved in a financial project or two that undertook to ensure an appropriate taxonomy and ontology.  At the time, since both taxonomy and ontology were relatively new to financial applications, non-financial experts where hired to aid the process.  These days, as I mentioned some time ago, both taxonomies and ontologies have become more [common](http://www.omg.org/hot-topics/fibo.htm) in finance.  Most [recently](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqJlNR7CKvQ), product companies, drive by I suspect client demand, have begin to venture down the long information organization [road](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)).

Moving on from the basics of Ontologies, its worth having a look at [Jena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jena_(framework)) (from a [Java](https://jena.apache.org/documentation/ontology/) perspective) which uses [OWL](https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/wiki/OWL).  Looking at Ontologies from a JavaScript perspective, have a look at [JSON-LD](http://www.slideshare.net/gkellogg1/jsonld-and-mongodb).  [RDFLib](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib) may also be of interest to anyone in this space.

All the above is interesting, and leads to a question of how you can leverage ontology in applications you are building.  Clearly machine readable data linkage is the under tone here.  Thinking back to the work I did years ago around User Interfaces, and data linkages, when read in the context of ontologies, “Deriving user interface from ontologies: a model-based approach” is probably required [reading](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-805/kese7-06.pdf).

> In this paper we present an approach to derive user interface (UI) from ontologies. It automatically generates UI according to declarative model specifications.

Its also worth having a [read](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-747/semais-2011.pdf) of the papers from Semantic Models for Adaptive
Interactive Systems (SEMAIS 2011).  Also, [ActiveRaUL](http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/system/files/swj549.pdf): Automatically Generated Web
Interfaces for Creating RDF Data, Model-Driven Rich User Interface [Generation](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-805/kese7-06.pdf)
from Ontologies for Data-Intensive Web Applications, Why UI Standards Should Come Together with [Formal](https://www.w3.org/2010/02/mbui/soi/probst.pdf) Ontologies.
