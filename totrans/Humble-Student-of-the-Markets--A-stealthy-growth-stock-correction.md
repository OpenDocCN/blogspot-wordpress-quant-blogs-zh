# Humble Student of the Markets: A stealthy growth stock correction

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2021/05/a-stealthy-growth-stock-correction.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2021/05/a-stealthy-growth-stock-correction.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models** 

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post, 

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The 

**Trend Asset Allocation Model**

 is an asset allocation model that applies trend following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or contraction (bearish)?"

My inner trader uses a 

**trading model**

, which is a blend of price momentum (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa). Subscribers receive real-time alerts of model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of the email alerts are updated weekly

. The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that began in March 2016 is shown below.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Buy equities*
*   Trend Model signal: Bullish*
*   Trading model: Neutral*

**Growth stocks stumble**

[Marketwatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/oversold-ark-innovation-etf-due-for-bounce-but-trouble-may-loom-for-market-if-it-doesnt-chart-watcher-says-11620235060)

reported last week that a meltdown of Cathie Wood's ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) may spark a S&P 500 pullback.

> “Many of the ARK and similar funds that hold high growth stocks are now trading between one and two standard deviations below their 50[-day moving averages] where buyers usually enter,” said technical analyst Andrew Adams in a Wednesday note for Saut Strategy. “I don’t think the market needs to go down any more, so a bounce attempt should occur given all the nearby support levels.”

Since the publication of that article, ARKK and other growth stocks have weakened further relative to the S&P 500.

> “If the high-growth areas start breaking support and taking the rest of the market down with them, then maybe the 3,980-4,000 zone in the S&P 500 will be retested after all,” Adams wrote. The S&P 500 finished at 4,167.59 on Wednesday, 1% off a record close of 4,211.47 set on April 29.
> 
> A test of support in the 3,980-4,000 area would mark a pullback of only 5% to 6%, but given the damage seen in other parts of the market could lead to “some huge losses” elsewhere, he said. “I’d rather avoid that, so for now I think we can use yesterday’s lows as a test to see if that represented a selling climax in much of the market.”

The growth-heavy NASDAQ 100 bounced off a test of its 50-day moving average (dma) after being rejected twice at resistance. More worrisome is the breach of the relative support zone of NDX compared to the S&P 500 and ARKK to the S&P 500\. Market internals such as the percentage of NASDAQ 100 stocks above their 50 dma is not oversold enough to signal a durable bottom.
