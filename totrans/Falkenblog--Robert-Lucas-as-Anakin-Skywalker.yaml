    about the economy, may sound like half-a-loaf to some, but anyone who writes this
    long and hard about a subject thinks his writing skills are for a greater good,
    not mere entertainment. That greater good is understanding the essence of how
    macroeconomies behave. So the standard praise for Skidelski is like the boss who
    sums up his secretary''s career by highlighting she was really good at making
    coffee and keeping his schedule, and then is nonplussed at her reaction.'

    circles, the most influential macroeconomist of the last quarter of the 20th century
    was Robert Lucas, of the University of Chicago, who won the Nobel Prize in 1995\.
    His great contribution to the discipline was to analyze how government policies
    influence the economy in part through their effect on people's expectations—a
    lesson that Keynes would likely have appreciated but that early followers of Keynes
    often ignored.

    at the data, and found inflation and unemployment were inversely correlated. They
    came up with fancy models as to how this was so, in a Keynesian framework. Milton
    Friedman and Edmund Phillips noted this depended on people mainaining stale inflation
    expectations, and that in the long run, inflation would rise higher and higher
    without lowering unemployment. Indeed, after one puts so much inflation into the
    system, it necessitates a great recession to unwind this inflationary pressure.

    he noted that the Keynesian model assumed that expectations were invariant for
    various interventions in fiscal and monetary policy. If expectations were rational,
    that is, if the actors in the economy knew as much as the modeler, their optimal
    response would neuter these interventions. In this way, money was neutralized,
    and in the stagflation era of the 1970''s, this had a lot of resonance: in the
    short run inflaton was a clusterpuck, in the long run it could not augment growth.
    Lucas created a dynamic model where economic actors had foresight, and were maximizing
    their utility. Using a relatively simple mathematical construct this reasoning
    was very clear. Indeed, for analytical types who dislike the imprecision of words,
    much more compelling than anything Friedman and Phelps wrote.'

- en: It is useful to note that even though Lucas highlighted the inconsistency in
    the Keynesian system, many Keynesians still believed in it anyway. Lucas, and
    Friedman, still relied on assumptions, and in anything as complicated as a macroeconomy,
    one can object, or ignore the model wholesale. Many thought that inflation would
    rise when unemployment went below 6.0%, but then in the late 90's it went to 4.4%,
    and inflation did not rise, Keynesians were perplexed, but then merely shifted
    the Phillips Curve over to the left. Thus, even Lucas's crowning achievement did
    not end the debate, he just made Keynesianism less popular. Keynesians no longer
    dominated economics departments, but they have always been very prominent.
