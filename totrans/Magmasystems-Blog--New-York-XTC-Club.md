# Magmasystems Blog: New York XTC Club

[Mike Roberts](http://mikebroberts.com/blogtastic/)

hosts the monthly meeting of the New York XTC club, held on Tuesdays at some place that serves an awful lot of Belgian beers. This is a good excuse to make the trek into NYC on a Tuesday.

By the way, XTC stands for "eXTreme Chugging" ... but seeing what kind of state Mike was in, it probably stands for "eXTreme Chundering".

Congrats to Mike for leaving Finetix and taking a new position. A long time coming...
