    of gains. Below I show results of the 30 instances since 1982 where 3+ days of
    gains were erased after a rally of 5+ days.

    In the past such-give backs after a steady rise have not suffered substantial
    additional selling. Instead they have often been followed by a resumption of the
    move up.
