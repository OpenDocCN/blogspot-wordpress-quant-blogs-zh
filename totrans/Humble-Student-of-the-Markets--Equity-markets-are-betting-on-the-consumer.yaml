    had gone from a central bank liquidity driven rally, which favors hard assets
    and asset inflation plays, to a focus on the American consumer as a source of
    growth (see

    telling me that first stage booster of central bank liquidity has dropped and
    and it's up to the second stage rocket, namely the American and European consumer,
    is on course to lift us past escape velocity. There is one drag to our rocket,
    however, and that's the prospect of a slowdown in China, as the weakness in commodity
    prices and commodity sensitive currencies are signaling those concerns.

- en: A bullish bet is therefore a bet on the health of the American and European
    consumer - and that is indeed a fragile foundation for a rally. Nevertheless,
    unless I am convinced otherwise the stock market remains in an uptrend. The chart
    below shows the weekly NYSE Summation Index, which is a breadth indicator, which
    I have overlaid a slow stochastic, an overbought/oversold indicator. If past history
    is any guide, stocks are tactically oversold and likely to rally in the next couple
    of weeks.

    to resemble the circled December 2010 correction and consolidation period in the
    middle of the QE2 rally. If you believe that the market is likely to correct further,
    another analog (circled) might correspond to the weakness seen in June 2010.

    in stocks for the next couple of weeks. In all cases, it would be wise to stay
    long, but carefully define your risk tolerance with the appropriate stop loss
