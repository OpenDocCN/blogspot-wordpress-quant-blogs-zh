- en: Let‚Äôs step back a tiny bit to recall with wonderment the idea that a single
    company decided to drive cars with custom cameras over every road they could access.
    Google is up to five million miles driven now. Each drive generates two kinds
    of really useful data for mapping. One is the actual tracks the cars have taken;
    these are proof-positive that certain routes can be taken. The other are all the
    photos. And what‚Äôs significant about the photographs in Street View is that Google
    can run algorithms that extract the traffic signs and can even paste them onto
    the deep map within their Atlas tool.
