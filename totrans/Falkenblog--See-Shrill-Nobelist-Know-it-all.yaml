    if the government would only implement his plan. For example, if the poverty line
    is $20,000 per year, and there are 30 million Americans below the poverty line,
    all we have to do is take the $600B we spend on the Defense budget, and give that
    to the poor! Solves poverty, and lowers violence, and it's a mathematical proof--certain
    to be true. Why doesn’t everyone listen to me!

    assumption that bad things only happen because of insufficient government involvement
    (though, he hates the Iraq war, which in his mind has nothing to do with true
    government). He blasts the immorality of conservatives, for example, noting that
    his friend told him that when former Federal Reserve Chief Paul Volker was informed
    his tight monetary policy would ‘kill’ Latin America in 1980, he said ‘that’s
    not my problem’! Monetarism, of course, was based on a religion (in spite of Friedman
    and Schwartz’s'

    too many, but then he also notes the current crisis is tragically causing millions
    to lose their homes, and ignores the intellectual and political genesis of easy
    credit.

    which is tax inefficient, even though there are many issues in signaling and asymmetric
    information that explain why the debt and equity choice is not degenerate at 100%
    debt (and further, that a 100% debt-financed company is, in effect, equity). As
    one who then complains of The Economic Establishment ignoring asymmetric information,
    this ‘proof’ of stupidity contains a massive amount of cognitive dissonance (you
    have to love Nobelists, at top universities, who have had top jobs in government,
    railing against The Establishment).

    what happened’, he says, ‘This is not 20-20 hindsight’. Sure, who didn’t call
    this credit crisis? His own work goes a long way of explaining the situation we
    are in, in his opinion, though Stiglitz and Weiss (about markets breaking down
    with asymmetric information), or Grossman and Stiglitz (about the impossibility
    of efficient markets), actually gave support to the kind of meddling by the government
    that was a major impetus to the relaxation of traditional underwriting standards.
    The disease is now the cure.

    models on the work of Scholes and Merton, though these guys were mere merely marketing
    figureheads, and the actual investment strategies of LTCM were made without input
    or oversight of Scholes and Merton, and were hardly derived from a canonical option
    pricing formula.

    investors. Everyone is an idiot, so giving the government more power is clearly
    a good idea (as everyone knows, only really smart people get into government (except
    when Republicans are charge)).

    Well, in a very, very vague way, but one could also say the roots of the crisis
    were mentioned in Adam Smith ('people are self interested') or the Bible ('money
    is the root of all evil'). His models show how certain assumptions cause markets
    to break down, but these are models, and his assumptions are just as 'unrealistic'
    as any other, because they assume a very specific information sets for all the
    actors, surely highly idealized . The implications of his models are ambiguous,
    because depending on how you modify the information of various parties, you can
    get opposite results, thus in practice, the efficacy of regulation is both an
    empirical matter, and needs a lot of common sense, two areas where Stiglitz is
    at a comparative disadvantage.

    this crisis would have been avoided if we had more regulation? As if the financial
    markets were not already a highly regulated sector, and the body whose full-time
    job of monitoring Fannie had absolutely nothing to say about he relaxation of
    credit standards, instead focusing on interest rate risk, or games executives
    played to get their big bonuses (important, to be sure, but still). When the regulators
    were doing it wrong, 10x more does not help. His model basically is like the cartoon
    below: I have highlighted issues in abstract models of perfect markets (under
    certain assumptions, equilibrium breaks down), therefore, it explains the current
    crisis in our highly regulated markets.'

    the absolute amount of his good ideas versus his bad ideas, he is insolvent. Reading
    the wacko letters to the editor in the local Arts Weekly gives a more balanced,
    and accurate view of how we got here.
