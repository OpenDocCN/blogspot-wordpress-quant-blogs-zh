    last several days. What I noted was that after making a new high it then pulled
    back for 4 days in a row. That 4 day drop has now been followed by a 3-day rally.
    At this point the SPX has not managed to overcome the recent highs. So I plugged
    those observations into a study and found some very compelling results.

    appear to heavily favor the bull side.
