    over the past few decades. The data touch on the question of how much energy different
    nations use to generate $1 of GDP. Are we getting more or less efficient in our
    use of energy? The numbers, as Krugman argued, show we’re generally getting more
    efficient. Below I’ve listed the numbers for US energy usage from the year’s 2001
    through 2011, in sequential order, from left to right, separated by commas, the
    units being BTUs per dollar of GDP:'

    Same is generally true for other nations. Fair enough. I’m not going to question
    that.

- en: But isn’t there something fishy about these numbers? The energy units are BTUs,
    and the final entry says we used precisely 7,328.424 BTUs per dollar of GDP in
    2011\. There are 7 specific digits reported in this number, implying that we know
    our energy/GDP figure to an accuracy of 1 part in 10 million. It’s incredibly
    impressive. Think about that “.424" at the end. It’s not “.425" or “.423" but
    exactly “.424".

    kind of illusory accuracy infects economics and finance quite widely. It may not
    be the most important issue in the world — even writing about it makes me feel
    like a grumpy old man — but we’d all think more clearly if we paid more attention
    to the numbers. So, what’s wrong here?
