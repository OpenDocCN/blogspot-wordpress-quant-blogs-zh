- en: To be sure, there are good reasons for the VIX decline. One reason is the drop
    in pair-wise correlation between stocks. When this happens, the diversification
    effect of owning different stocks rises, which depresses index volatility relative
    to individual stock volatility.

    The MOVE Index, which measures interest rate volatility, is also at depressed
    levels.

    to live with the possibility of 90%+ drawdowns. Bilello went on to state that

    he was silent on the timing, or the trigger for such an event.

    classes, the trigger for a VIX spike might come from a non-equity asset class.
