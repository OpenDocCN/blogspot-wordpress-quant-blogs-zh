    case. The recent rally, which has been led by the golds and deep cyclicals, have
    all the appearances of a dead cat bounce rather than the start of a sustainable
    advance.

    with the premise that the Australian Dollar is more sensitive to growth in China
    and the Canadian Dollar is more sensitive to growth in the American economy. A
    breach of the uptrend in this cross rate would would be a signal that the market's
    belief that Chinese growth is slowing, which would be negative for the global
    growth outlook. The breakdown in this currency pair cannot be regarded as good
    news for the prospects of Chinese growth.

    be a test of market psychology of whether bad news is good news, i.e. economic
    slowdown will lead to central bank stimulus, which is bullish, or bad news is
    bad news.
