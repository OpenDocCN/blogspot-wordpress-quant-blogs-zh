- en: The easy availability tools such as MarketQA, Barra and Matlab, just to name
    a few, have vastly brought down the cost of entry into quantitative investing.
    The price of that low cost of entry is that many quants are framing the problem
    of alpha generation and risk control in similar ways. Given the large allocation
    of funds to quantitative equity investing, the events of August 2007 were inevitable.

    process a large amount of information. Your advantage as a human being and an
    experienced investor is your knowledge of the markets. A smart way of being a
    good quant is to combine those two elements by using the computer to model the
    way fundamental investors think about the markets.

    driven US equity market neutral portfolio during August 2007\. The underlying
    model is not the Holy Grail and has its limitations, but it is still possible
    to build quant models that don’t put you in a crowded trade.
