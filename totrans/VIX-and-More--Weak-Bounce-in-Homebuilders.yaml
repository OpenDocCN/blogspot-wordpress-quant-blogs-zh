- en: Pending home sales are up 5.3% today, handily beating the consensus expectations,
    which called for a 1.0% decline.  Barry Ritholtz at [The Big Picture](http://bigpicture.typepad.com/)
    has a different interpretation of the data in [Media Gets Pending Home Sales Wrong
    (Again!)](http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2008/08/major-media-get.html)  Not
    surprisingly, Barry is less optimistic about the state of the housing market and
    emphasizes the importance of looking at year over year changes instead of sequential
    monthly changes.

- en: The homebuilders are a very interesting sector – and one worth following closely.  Homebuilder
    stocks (as measured by the [XHB](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XHB)
    ETF) actually peaked at 39.39 back in early February 2007, several months prior
    to the time frame covered in the chart below.

- en: For a few months, homebuilders looked as if they had made a bottom in January,
    when they rallied more than 60% from their January low to their April high, only
    to grind down to a new bottom in July.  The graphic shows a sharp two day bounce
    off of the July low, followed by a lot of sideways action over the course of the
    past three weeks.  At this stage, the July bottom does not yet look convincing
    and XHB is actually trading down as I type this.

- en: With foreclosure activity now accounting for an [increasingly large percentage](http://www.realtor.org/press_room/news_releases/2008/ehs_down_in_june)
    of all home sales, statistics such as [selling price per square foot](http://www.dqnews.com/Charts/Monthly-Charts/SF-Chronicle-Charts/ZIPSFC.aspx)
    (see Solano County, in particular) may help to sort out some of the divergence
    between sales volume and sales price data.
