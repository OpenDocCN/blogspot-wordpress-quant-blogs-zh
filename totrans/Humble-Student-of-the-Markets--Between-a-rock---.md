Poor Ben Bernanke! On April 14, 2009, he gave a

[speech](http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20090414a.htm)

stating that the Fed was well aware of inflationary concerns and was ready to act upon them at the appropriate time:

> I can assure you that monetary policy makers are fully committed to acting as needed to withdraw on a timely basis the extraordinary support now being provided to the economy, and we are confident in our ability to do so.

On one hand, Tyler Durden at

is wondering about how the Fed may have to further expand its balance sheet to accommodate the pace of Treasury and Agency issuance.

Whatever the Fed does, the market isn’t going like the results. These circumstances can’t be bullish for equities.
