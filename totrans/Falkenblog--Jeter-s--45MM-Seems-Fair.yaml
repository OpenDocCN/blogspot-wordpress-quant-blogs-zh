    he's fielding offers like $45MM for 3 years. Yet, no one seems very angry about
    exhorbitant pay in athletics, as compared to CEOs.

    I really don''t care what they pay him. It''s not my money." If it were catching,
    this healthy-minded attitude toward the paychecks of our fellow man would make
    the world a better, happier place.'

    We can see he is good at what he does--much better than us or anyone we know personally--and
    thus earns his pay. In contrast, the suspicion is that CEOs are merely involved
    in a massive crony-capitalism game that discriminates against those who don't
    have the right family and friends. That strikes many as unfair.

    Mae and the mortgage market into the ground. Rahm Emmanuel made made $16.2 million
    in his two-and-a-half-years as an investment banker. Bob Rubin pocketed $150MM
    while working for Citigroup. The list goes on and on (recent OMB director Peter
    Orzag was just hired as an investment banker by Citibank). These are problematic
    because we know they are getting paid merely for access--Rubin claims he was totally
    unaware Citi had $54B in mortgages on their balance sheet, which was probably
    true--for getting the right person to answer a phone, or bury some exception in
    the latest 2000-page bill or trade agreement. That's a game not available to most
    of us.

    Lynch CEO Stanley O'Neal made $46MM and $48MM in 2006 and 2007 respectively, then
    got a $161MM severance package after Merrill was sold for a song to Bank America.

- en: The CEO is often a compromise between conflicting groups. He must be blithely
    ignorant about the inconsistent objectives articulated to the team, such as trying
    to simultaneously prioritize innovation and tradition, a meritocracy that aggressively
    promotes racial bean-counting, or a strong sexual harassment policy and a really
    fun Christmas party. People who are really good at logical puzzles, who excel
    at something, are often not very good at managing people because they can not,
    or will not, suffer fools well. Thus, in spite of conspicuous examples where the
    highest IQ person is both an idea generator and the boss such as Larry Ellison
    or Bill Gates, in general the functions involve different skill sets. The result
    is a leader in a modern reverse dominance hierarchy who is paid to keep the peace
    and make people feel good, as opposed to make really important strategic and tactical
    decisions. It's a skill, but not one worth tens, let alone hundreds, of millions
    of dollars.

  zh: CEO经常是冲突群体之间的妥协。他必须对团队表达的不一致目标一无所知，比如试图同时优先考虑创新和传统、积极推动种族统计的精英制，或者制定严厉的性骚扰政策和举办一场非常有趣的圣诞派对。真正擅长逻辑谜题的人，在某些方面表现出色的人，通常并不善于管理人员，因为他们无法或不愿意忍受傻瓜。因此，尽管有显眼的例子，最高智商的人既是想法生成者又是老板，比如拉里·埃里森或比尔·盖茨，但总的来说，这两个职能涉及不同的技能。结果是，现代的领导者处在一个事态相反的支配等级中，他被付钱来维护和让人觉得舒适，而不是做出真正重要的战略和战术决策。这是一种技能，但不值得数千万，更别提数亿美元。
- en: We don't mind inequality when we know it is for true alpha. What bothers people,
    and I think rightly, is when people are getting paid when they really do not have
    alpha, in that their ability to chair meetings, spout cliches at group functions,
    or golf leisurely, is something anyone could do. In contrast, if we played shortstop
    for the Yankees we know the team would suffer. It's a problem I don't have any
    solution for.

  zh: 当我们知道这是为真正的α而不是其他人时，我们并不介意不平等。让人困扰的是，我认为完全没有α的人在得到报酬时，因为他们主持会议、在团体活动中滔滔不绝、或是悠闲地打高尔夫，这是任何人都能做到的事情。相比之下，如果我们替洋基队打游击手，我们知道球队会表现受损。这是一个我没有解决方案的问题。
