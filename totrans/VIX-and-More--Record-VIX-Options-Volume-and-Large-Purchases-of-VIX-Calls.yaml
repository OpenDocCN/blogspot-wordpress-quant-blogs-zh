- en: With about a half hour left in today’s trading session, purchases of [VIX options](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20options)
    are unusually high – much higher than yesterday. As I type this, over 855,000
    [VIX calls](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20calls) have been
    traded, with today likely to see the highest VIX call volume since the August
    2011 market panic. Data from [LivevolPro](http://www.livevolpro.com/) indicate
    that 28% of VIX call transactions are being bought on the ask, versus 16% sold
    at the bid, reflecting a lack of price sensitivity on the part of the buyers of
    VIX calls, who are the driving force behind these transactions. All told, a record
    1.3 million VIX options contracts have been traded, breaking the old record of
    1.22 million from September 11, 2012.

    has been on the rise as of late, at its current level it is in the middle of its
    2012 range.

    market, there are signs of increasing anxiety and concern.
