- en: Presidents do have wide discretion to declare national emergencies and take
    unilateral action for which they ordinarily need legislative approval. A “latitude”,
    John Locke wrote in 1689 (and his writings influenced the US constitution), must
    be “left to the executive power, to do many things of choice which the laws do
    not prescribe” since the legislature is often “too slow” in an emergency. American
    presidents have, for example, suspended the constitutional guarantee of habeas
    corpus (Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War), forced people of Japanese descent
    into internment camps (Franklin Delano Roosevelt during the second world war)
    and imposed warrantless surveillance on Americans (George W. Bush after the September
    11th attacks). With some notable exceptions, including when the Supreme Court
    baulked at Harry Truman’s seizure of steel mills during the Korean War, the judiciary
    has usually blessed these actions. In addition, Congress has passed dozens of
    laws—New York University law school’s Brennan Centre for Justice has catalogued
    123—giving presidents specific powers during emergencies.
