    requires an x64\. I’m not aware of any other grid computing product that forces
    the same requirements. Unclear why Microsoft has forced this hardware requirement,
    as it effectively rules out a lot of hardware investment banks might want to use,
    and seems to only benefit the hardware manufacturers.

    (MMC) 3.0 snap-in which provides node management, To Do list, performance monitoring
    of nodes (basically a consolidated perfmon view) and remote desktop sessions.

    has a [COM API](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/ccpsdk/ccp/microsoft_compute_cluster_pack.asp)
    for job scheduling – no .NET :(.

    whereas Computer Cluster is based on [MPI](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/ccs/overview.mspx).
