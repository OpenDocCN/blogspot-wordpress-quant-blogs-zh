    the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    advanced, readings became increasingly overbought. The S&P 500 has spent two consecutive
    weeks above its weekly Bollinger Band (BB). Past upper BB episodes have tended
    to be signals of positive momentum. that led to further gains. The market spent
    several months on an upper BB ride in late 2017 and early 2018 before it finally
    topped out.
