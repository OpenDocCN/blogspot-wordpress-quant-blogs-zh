- en: The CBOE Volatility Index, which is usually referenced here by its ticker symbol,
    VIX, seems to be settling comfortably into a range between 22.00 and 30.00 that
    is has traded in since early July. Given that the relatively narrow eight point
    range has now held up for three months, there is a natural tendency to wonder
    whether the VIX has started to form a natural top and bottom that will result
    in an extended stay in this range.

- en: The chart below tracks the daily movements in the VIX back to August 2008 and
    shows how the gravitational forces working on the VIX have pulled it back from
    just shy of 90 to the low to middle 20s. This is still above the 19.00 – 22.50
    range that prevailed in August 2008, but not by a large margin.

    Alcoa ([AA](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX)) technically kicks
    off after tomorrow’s close – I still think there is a strong probability that
    the VIX spends the balance of the year in the same range that it has been during
    the past three months. In fact, with earnings next week from the likes of General
    Electric ([GE](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/GE)), Bank of America
    ([BAC](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/BAC)), Citigroup ([C](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/C)),
    JPMorgan Chase ([JPM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/JPM)), Goldman
    Sachs ([GS](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/GS)), Intel ([INTC](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/INTC)),
    International Business Machines ([IBM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/IBM)),
    Johnson & Johnson ([JNJ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/JNJ)), [CSX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/CSX)
    and others, I expect the tone for the balance of the year to be established in
    another 2-3 weeks, at most.

    sell some options – including VIX strangles – before the third quarter results
    start pouring in. I will have more on some VIX short [strangle](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/strangle)
    trading ideas in short order.
