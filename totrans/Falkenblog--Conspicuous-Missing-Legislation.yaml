    relating to actual home buyers. That is, the quaint 20% down on a home purchase?
    The Income-to-debt levels? In crazy times those things weren't verified, and there
    were non-profits organizations receiving money from the Federal Government that
    paid for down payments so that everyone was happy. To blame this on 'derivatives'
    is absurd.

    the option value (keep upside, lose 3% if wrong). But that's related to hard-working
    people as opposed to abstract caricatures like 'bankers' and such.

    which does not play well when grandstanding new legislative initiatives. By logical
    extension, this would disproportionately affect NonAsian-Minorities (NAMs). Better
    to blame this on the greed of rich people, mathematical mistakes by quants, anyone
    but actual people instigating the necessary instruments for this boondoggle, or
    their ''well intentioned'' legislators. This urge to blame the wealthy for anything
    that goes wrong clearly plays well to the median voter. Perhaps I should pitch
    a book for a new ''grass-roots'' movement against the plutocracy: '''

    school, bathroom, recreation center. It means placating the mob unrelated to the
    weight of their opinions. Our founding fathers fought to establish a republican
    democracy, but now all we see are democracy fetishes, indeed, legislators go out
    of their way to emphasize their low origins and how their legislation helps the
    lowest levels of society (ignoring illegal immigrants, of course). So current
    rectifications conveniently exclude actual home buyers who got us into this mess,
    because, they aren't empathetic to the median voter.
