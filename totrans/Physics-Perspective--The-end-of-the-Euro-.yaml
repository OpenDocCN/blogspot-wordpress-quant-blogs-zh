    might arise from the ashes).

    as the new currency of a smaller union including Germany and The Netherlands (in
    which case the value of the Euro would rise significantly), or it might persist
    as the new currency of the periphery countries after Germany bolts (in which case
    the value of the Euro would fall significantly). Or the Europeans might finally
    find a way through the ongoing nightmare. Not betting on that one.

    integration or allow printing money. This assumes that a cost-benefit analysis
    indicate that this would be less costly than a disorderly break-up of the Euro-zone
    and an integrated European monetary system. This ignores a deep-seated German
    mistrust of modern finance as well as a strong belief in a hard currency and stable
    money. Based on their own history, Germans believe that this is essential to economic
    and social stability. It would be unsurprising to see Germany refuse the type
    of monetary accommodation and open-ended commitment necessary to resolve the crisis
    by either fiscal union or debt monetisation.

    hard for sovereign defaults. I wish the Greeks had gone ahead with their referendum.
    For all the complaining about the slack morals of the Greek taxpayer, every debt-creating
    transaction has two sides -- and the creditors (French and German banks) bear
    as much responsibility as the debtors.

    countries and more fiscal centralization. The Germans will force the weaker countries
    out of the euro area or, more likely, Germany and some others will leave the euro
    to form their own currency. The euro zone could be expanded again later, but only
    after much deeper political, economic and fiscal integration.
