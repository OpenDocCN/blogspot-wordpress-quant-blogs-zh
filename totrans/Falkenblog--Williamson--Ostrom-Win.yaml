    prize, but it's still all harmless fun. Oliver Williamson wrote a bunch of interesting
    stuff about the value of the firm--Ronald Coase stuff--and transaction costs.
    For instance, he highlights the 'own' rate of interest for owning commodities
    because it allows one to avoid transaction costs delivering the underlying commodity.
    This has relevance to the contango and normal backwardization of futures contracts.

    not highly mathematical. Yet, like Knight, it's hard to develop models based on
    his work, which makes him a surprising result. An idea that generates a model,
    no matter how abstract, seems the economic ideal. I think Williamson's work is
    very good for undergraduates, so hopefully this will get him read more.

- en: with Oliver Williamson. The former wrote on contango and futures. This work
    was consistent with Williamson's work, and I remember relating some ideas directly,
    but to my knowledge Williamson never applied his work to futures directly.
