    current income, and is the basis for the multiplier, which magically translates
    investment in alien defense systems into greater prosperity. Milton Friedman's

    income but by one's longer-term income expectations. The key conclusion of this
    theory is that transitory, short-term changes in income have little effect on
    consumer spending behavior. Federal stimulus plans, for example, are intrinsically
    temporary.

    of rewards than the rewards themselves. In studies with monkeys, where the monkey
    sees the light, pushes the button, and gets a treat, very quickly the monkey figures
    it out. Interestingly, the dopamine response fires not when he eats or receives
    the treat, but rather when he sees the light. The brain present values the stimulus,
    so that by the time the treat is tasted it has already been figuratively consumed.
    A short video on the dopamine effect is

    wealth is primarily ability as opposed to cash. If you have a niche, a role where
    you feel valued, you are wealthy. The government can create only so many post-office
    jobs that grant sinecures arbitrarily, and all those temporary job incentives
    are seen as the transitory, ephemeral things that they are. To create real wealth,
    which is what really matters, you need to allow individuals to find their niches,
    which is best done indirectly.
