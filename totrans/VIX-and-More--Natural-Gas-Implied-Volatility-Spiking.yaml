- en: Perhaps it is just a coincidence that the “Oil VIX” appeared on the scene just
    as the implied volatility in oil futures (or at least as captured by [USO](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/USO))
    was hitting an eight month high.  The “Oil VIX” (formally known as the CBOE Crude
    Oil Volatility Index; ticker [OVX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/OVX))
    and crude oil may get the lion’s share of the energy headlines, but lately it
    has been natural gas that has been making the more dramatic moves.

- en: A look at the three month chart of [UNG](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/UNG)
    (the natural gas ETF that is the counterpart to USO), courtesy of the ISE, shows
    implied volatility steadily increasing over the past five weeks, with the gap
    between implied volatility and historical volatility continuing to widen – all
    while natural gas has pulled back about 27%.

- en: Natural gas implied volatility levels are higher than oil implied volatility
    levels at the moment, and the pullback in natural gas presents some interesting
    trading opportunities.  Some momentum players are already short here and some
    value hunters are buying on weakness, particularly if they believe in the long-term
    commodity bull and other supply and demand issues that are specific to natural
    gas.

- en: The case for natural gas trading sideways from current levels is hard to make.  Directional
    bets are expensive, due to high IV.  Two trades I am looking hard at, with a bullish
    directional bias, are [bull put spreads](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/bear%20put%20spread)
    and [call backspreads](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/call%20backspread).  The
    former limits upside and downside; the latter is more aggressive and more risky.
