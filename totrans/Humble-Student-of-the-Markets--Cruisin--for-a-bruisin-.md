# Humble Student of the Markets: Cruisin' for a bruisin'

**Mid-week market update**

:

[Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-16/bank-of-america-says-market-primed-for-first-quarter-melt-up)

reported that BAML strategist Michael Harnett wrote a report back on December 12 forecasting a melt-up. He believed the market's gains would be front loaded in 2020\. and he projected an S+P 500 target of 3,333 by March 3\. The index reached that level intra-day today, and it's still January. Are the front-loaded gains over?

Sentiment is certainly extended. II %bulls rose to 59.4% this week, and the bull-bear spread has reached the highest level since October 2018.

observed that Trump's tweets about the stock market had reached a new record.

As well, Macro Charts pointed out that further analysis from SentimenTrader showed that option buy-to-open volume reached a record high for a second week in a row.

It certainly seems that the stock market is "cruisin' for a bruisin'".
