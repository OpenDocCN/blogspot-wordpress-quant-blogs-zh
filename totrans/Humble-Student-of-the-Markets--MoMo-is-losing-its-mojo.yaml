    undergoing a regime shift from growth to value (see [What would Bob Farrell say?](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2021/01/23/what-would-bob-farrell-say/))
    and compared today''s Big Tech momentum stocks, not to the dot-com mania, but
    the Nifty Fifty era. On the weekend, I rhetorically asked in a [tweet](https://twitter.com/HumbleStudent/status/1363156520670793731)

    a sign that speculative momentum was nearing the end of its run.'
