# Magmasystems Blog: FIX serializer for .NET

> 来源：[http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2007/03/fix-serializer-for-net.html#0001-01-01](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2007/03/fix-serializer-for-net.html#0001-01-01)

Anyone know of a FIX (and FAST and FiXML) serializer for .NET ... something that will reflect over an arbitrary object and produce a FIX string? I imagine that you will be able to tag an object with custom attributes that let you specify the FIX tags.
