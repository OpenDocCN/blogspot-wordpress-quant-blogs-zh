    One of the core courses is Corporate Finance, and one of the key principles they
    learn is about risk and reward, and the standard theory is framework--not a model--that
    holds that the expected return of a financial asset is a function of risk, where
    you are paid to endure this unpleasant, irreducible characteristic. The quantity
    of risk is measured by a covariance with priced risk factors which are as-yet
    unidentified time series like the stock market, and there’s a linear relationship
    between this risk metric and expected returns. Risk measures the 'how much', and
    the price you receive for this is from risk premiums. Thus, expected returns are
    determined by this crucial, objective characteristic (Cliff Asness nicely describes
    the expected return as dominating the variance in the forward to Antti Ilmanen's

    effort may have been put into testing the CAPM equation than any other result
    in finance. The results are quite mixed and in many ways discouraging.” Eugene
    Fama and Kenneth French called the CAPM “empirically vacuous,” and APT creator
    Stephen Ross noted that “having a low, middle or high beta does not matter; the
    expected return is the same.” These are all major proponents of this approach,
    so I think it's fair to say that the standard model is a theory in search of validation.
    As the elusive risk factor is clearly not 'the market', but something like the
    market, new factors are proposed all the time.

    a factor. One could simply assert it as being intuitively risk, as Fama and French
    did, which via Arbitrage Pricing Theory logic should be priced.  Alternatively,
    one could write down a Stochastic Discount Function, as

    it to be, and the great elders of rigor have proven these are all kosher, so,
    once written down as above, you can simply append the resulting ''betas'' to the
    above 3-factor Fama-French model and not explain exactly how they work together
    given one''s earlier motivation that contained no value or growth factor (It reminds
    me of how Marx''s totally wrong but complicated and rigorous Das Kapital allowed
    generations of theorists to talk about the Hegelian dialectic as if it were real,
    because nonbelievers simply didn''t want to waste time on it, and insiders could
    all point to thoughtful people who believed and extended the great work).'

    The nice thing is that one has data on their leverage going back to 1968 or so
    with quarterly data, so you can throw it against the wall, and guess what, "Our
    single-factor model prices size, book-to-market, momentum, and bond portfolios
    with an R2 of 77 percent and an average annual pricing error of 1 percent." That
    is, 25 size-value sorted portfolios, plus a momentum portfolio, and some US Tbond
    portfolios.

    That's the result of overfitting. You fit the target, in this case, some portfolios
    from Ken French's website, and you have a pub, especially if you write down an
    SDF, but it's just the flavor of the month, the latest potential solution to a
