    out that the market missed flashing a rare Zweig Breadth Thrust buy signal by
    one day (see [Trading the breadth thrust](https://twitter.com/WillieDelwiche/status/1326509798318333954)).
    Market breadth, as measured by the ZBT Indicator, has to rise from an oversold
    level of 0.40 to an overbought reading of 0.615 or more within a 10-day window.
    Four weeks ago, it achieved that in 11 days, and the rally fizzled sooner afterward.'

- en: The ZBT buy signal is extremely rare, and it has occurred only six times since
    2004\. In all instances, the market has been higher in 12-months, though it "failed"
    on two occasions inasmuch as it pulled back before roaring ahead to new highs.

- en: I observed on the weekend that we are on the verge of another possible ZBT buy
    signal (see [Zweig Breadth Thrust and triple-top watch](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2020/11/08/zweig-breadth-thrust-and-triple-top-watch/)).
    The 10-day window ends today. Alas, the ZBT just failed to flash a buy signal.
    It topped out yesterday (Tuesday) at 0.606, which was just short of its 0.615
    target, and it retreated today.
