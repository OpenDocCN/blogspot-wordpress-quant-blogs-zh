    life. You might ask yourself what your legacy is going to be. Does your coding
    and architecture skills somehow contribute to the greater good of the world, and
    will humanity benefit from your efforts?

    "simulations" for CRI, and probably over one million school children have used

- en: Classroom Inc (CRI) was originally formed as a non-profit partnership between
    IBM, JP Morgan, and Bear Stearns. Lewis Bernard, who was very high up at JPMC,
    was the CEO of Classroom Inc. The mission was to provide education computer software
    to inner-city and rural schools where the children could benefit from an "alternative
    learning experience".

    put in a certain life situation. For example, one simulation put you in the role
    of a bank manaer, while another one put you in the role as the CEO of a paper
    company. Each simulation consisted of 12 or 15 "chapters", where each chapter
    was devoted to a certain issue.

    students, and by the time I finished up, each simulation reached more than 250,000
    students.

- en: The entire framework was written in MFC/C++. A lot of the internal design came
    from the old Macromedia Director, which was very popular at the time for creating
    interactive storyboards. A typical simulation took 6 to 8 months to write. The
    team consisted of a producer, 2 writers, 2 artists, a QA tester, and myself. Every
    few weeks, I would get a ZIP file in the mail consisting of the script for a new
    chapter, and all of the graphics, plus some haphazard directions for one or more
    "activities" that the kids would have to do in the chapter.

    decided that they wanted to move to a new, internal Flash-based system, and wanted
    to end all C++ development. It took the IBM consultants quite a while to get the
    first simulation out there in Flash, but they finally managed to recreate all
    of the simulations and re-release them.
