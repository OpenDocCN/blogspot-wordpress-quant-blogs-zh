- en: So I was at this presentation today by the CFO of Northern Trust, a 'bank' based
    in Chicago, with about $80B in assets on its balance sheet, and about $800B in
    assets under management. You should check out their material

- en: . This company has a current P/E of around 16, which basically means the market
    thinks a dollar of earnings here is worth about 50% more than a dollar from its
    peers. This is an example of a finance company that avoided the subprime mess,
    and really it has been the past 12 months, where they have risen 20% while the
    financial indices have fallen 25%, that has generated the separation.

- en: The CFO, Steve Fradkin, had several themes that I found really refreshing. First,
    he noted that if you look at JPMorgan you see that it only recently combined with
    Chase, which had just recently joined with Chemical, etc. The cumulative effects
    of all these undigested pieces makes for several problems. First, it screws up
    earnings, as special charges are created, amortized, etc., making it very difficult
    to know how you are doing, because earnings contain, or exclude, so many special
    charges, 80% of the earnings are always 'special'. Secondly, you have turf wars,
    and different cultures fighting for the soul of the company. This can really lead
    one to take one's eye off the ball.

    connecting savers to companies that need the capital. They aren't in the business
    of speculating, or arbitraging a seemingly great spread in auto ABS.

- en: Fradkin noted, with a nice display of corporate candor, that in the early 1990's,
    they were a standard, smaller bank, that didn't have some master plan to become
    what they became. By merely focusing on their niche, institutional clients and
    wealthy individuals, and forsaking the infinite number of other ways to make money,
    the growth took them to someplace they did not anticipate. They became one of
    the leading firms in assets under management, though you don't much hear about
    them because they don't have a retail focus.

- en: Fradkin also noted that when he became CFO five years ago, he visited the nasdaq,
    where his stock trades (ticker NTRS), the trading guys there said they could give
    him information on block trades, etc. What would he do with this, he asked? Good
    question. I wish I could get information on CFO visits to exchanges. Those CFOs
    that are interested in daily stock market activity would be great shorts, because
    you simply can't build a business looking at that kind of information.

- en: By sticking to one thing, understanding it, and doing it well, they have grown
    fantastically, adding a lot of shareholder value. Contrast that with CitiCorp,
    which is involved in everything, and will probably sell itself off in parts so
    that they can finally understand what business they are in.
