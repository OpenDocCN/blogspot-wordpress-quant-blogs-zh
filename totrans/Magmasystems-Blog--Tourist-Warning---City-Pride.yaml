    told us that you actually has to go up to the bar to order your beers. (Warning

    pub in New York). The bartender had no idea what I was talking about (Warning
    #2).'

    free to add a tip onto it ... which I did (a 10%, 2 Pound tip) (Warning #3 ...
    I was told the next day never to tip the bartender).'
