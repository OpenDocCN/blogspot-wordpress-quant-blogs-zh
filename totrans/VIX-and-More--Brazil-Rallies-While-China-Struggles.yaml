    st="on">China</country-region> since late October, but still bullish on <country-region
    st="on"><place st="on">Brazil</place></country-region>, as indicated by the strong
    performance in [EWZ](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=ewz), the iShares MSCI
    Brazil Index ETF.  Not only is EWZ showing a gain for the year, but in an impressive
    display of strength, it has rallied more than 30% off of the January low.  This
    performance puts EWZ not only well ahead of the most popular Chinese ETF, [FXI](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=fxi),
    but also considerably ahead of the broad market emerging market ETF, [EEM](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=eem),
    known formally as the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Index.

    that are worth singling out as well.  My [Portfolio A1](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Portfolio%20A1)
    holds [Tele Norte Leste Participacoes SA (TNE)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=tne)
    and has also been long [Brasil Telecom Participacoes SA (BRP)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=brp)
    in recent months, but there are even better plays.  In fact, of the handful of
    long-term global holdings that I believe you could almost buy and forget about,
    two of my favorites are Brazilian giants.  At the top of the list is [Petroleo
    Brasileiro SA (PBR)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=pbr), a.k.a. Petrobras,
    the superbly managed national oil company that is pushing the envelope in the
    ultra-deep recovery space with their [massive Tupi oilfield](http://www.rigzone.com/news/article.asp?a_id=52788).  Close
    behind is [Vale (RIO)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=rio), formerly know
    as Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, the metals and mining giant that recently extracted
    a [65% price increase in iron ore prices](http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/newstex/AFX-0013-23210344.htm)
    from Baosteel, the largest steel company in China.

    best blue chip oil and iron plays out there.  For those wishing a broader, more
    diversified play, EWZ is hard to beat, especially as <country-region st="on">Brazil</country-region>
    continues to outpace <country-region st="on"><place st="on">China</place></country-region>.
