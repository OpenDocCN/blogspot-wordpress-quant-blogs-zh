    [VIX and More EVALS](http://vixandmoreevals.blogspot.com/), which is a model portfolio

    a little about each service on their respective blogs. For the newsletter, today
    I posted [Q3 2012 Newsletter Update, with Stock of the Week +107% YTD and +4473%
    Since Inception](http://vixandmoresubscriber.blogspot.com/2012/10/q3-2012-newsletter-update-with-stock-of.html),
    in which I provide some details about how I select the Stock of the Week, discuss
    some recent picks, and provide performance data going back to the March 2008 inception.
    As far as EVALS is concerned, this service has gone through two iterations, with
    the most recent iteration dating from November 2011 and focusing on VIX ETPs.
    In [EVALS Q3 2012 Update: Up 70.59% Since November 2011 Inception](http://vixandmoreevals.blogspot.com/2012/10/evals-q3-2012-update-up-7059-since.html)
    I delve into some details about this model portfolio and provide a fair amount
    of data with respect to trades and performance.'

    More blog is now over and I can get back to posting free content on a regular
    basis. I also realize there are quite a few emails and blog comments which I need
    to attend to; I hope to address these in short order.
