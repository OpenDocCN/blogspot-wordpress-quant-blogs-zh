    is because I believe financial time series is too non-stationary to allow one
    to say what was optimal in the backtest is necessarily optimal in the future.
    Most traders I know would rather trade a strategy that is insensitive to small
    changes in parameters, or alternatively, a "parameterless" strategy that is effectively
    an average of models with different parameters.'

- en: That being said, if you can only trade one model with one specific set of parameters,
    it is rational to ask how one can pick the best (optimal) set of parameters. Many
    trading models have a good number of parameters, and it is quite onerous to find
    the optimal values of all these parameters simultaneously. Recently, Ron Schoenberg
    published an

    needs to compute the P&L for 62 different sets of parameters, and the whole procedure
    only takes 58 seconds.'

    are close to optimal, he did find a few surprises: namely, that RSI of period
    3 or 4 is significantly more profitable than the 2 that Connors used, at least
    in the backtest period.'

    this optimization withholding some out-of-sample data, and see if these parameters
    are still optimal in that withheld data set. Since he didn't do that, we need
    to wait for another year to find out ourselves!
