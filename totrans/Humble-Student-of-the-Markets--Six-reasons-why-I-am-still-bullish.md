# Humble Student of the Markets: Six reasons why I am still bullish

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2016/10/six-reasons-why-i-am-still-bullish.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2016/10/six-reasons-why-i-am-still-bullish.html#0001-01-01)

**Mid-week market update:**

 I wrote on the weekend to buy Yom Kippur, which ends today (see

[Buy Yom Kippur! SPX 2500 by Passover?](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/10/09/buy-yom-kippur-spx-2500-by-passover/)

). My inner trader sent out an email to subscribers yesterday indicating that he had added to his long position by buying a high-beta small cap position.

I would like to outline the reasons why I remain intermediate term bullish on equities:

*   Market breadth is supportive of more gains
*   Risk appetite is healthy across the board
*   Investor anxiety is high, which is contrarian bullish
*   The Fed is equity market friendly
*   Growth expectations are healthy
*   A period of positive seasonality is approaching
