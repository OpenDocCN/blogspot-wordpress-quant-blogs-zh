    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading
    "buy" signal. The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of
    the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. Past trading of
    the trading model has shown turnover rates of about 200% per month.

    Spirits in the stock market and the real economy. Small business confidence measures
    shot up from the week of his inauguration and have remained elevated ever since.
    PE multiples expanded throughout the course of the year, which was not solely
    due to his tax policy – it was also about his swagger and I-don’t-give-a-f**k
    persona.

    September, when the weekly RSI became overbought and stayed overbought. My former
    Merrill colleague Walter Murphy called this a "good overbought" condition, where
    the market continues to advance while remaining overbought. Since 1990, there
    have been two episodes when the market flashed a series of overbought readings.
    One lasted 10 months, the other lasted 14 months. In both instances, stock prices
    were significantly higher afterwards.

    back to 1950\. They found that past episodes of weekly RSI above 80 has been bullish
    for equity returns, though the sample size is still low (N=13). The table below
    from LPL, which I edited and annotated, shows that the excess return from the
    price momentum effect fades out after six months. The incremental return from
    six to twelve months when when weekly RSI > 80 is not significantly different
    from the "at any time" returns.
