## ActorFX: The Actor Framework for Windows Azure

Nice to see an Actor [framework](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/interoperability/archive/2012/12/05/ms-open-tech-releases-a-new-project-actor-framework-how-to-lower-the-barrier-to-entry-for-cloud-computing-act-i.aspx) from [MS Open Tech](http://www.codeplex.com/site/users/view/MSOpenTech) designed to aid writing Azure cloud applications.  Code is over on [CodePlex](https://actorfx.codeplex.com/).  Channel9 earlier this year has a [video](http://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Going+Deep/Hewitt-Meijer-and-Szyperski-The-Actor-Model-everything-you-wanted-to-know-but-were-afraid-to-ask) worth watching on Actors – Hewitt, Meijer and Szyperski: The Actor Model (everything you wanted to know, but were afraid to ask).

It will be interesting to see how ActorFx evolves over time, and if it manages to catch up with [akka](http://akka.io/) over in the Java VM stack.
