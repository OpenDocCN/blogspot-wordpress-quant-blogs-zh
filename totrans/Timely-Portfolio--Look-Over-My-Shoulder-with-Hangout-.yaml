- en: Inspired by the post [More Office Hours in 2012](http://googleadsdeveloper.blogspot.com/2012/01/more-office-hours-in-2012.html)
    and the [survey results](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2012/01/googles-visualization-of-survey.html),
    I thought I would offer office hours while blogging/playing in R.  If anyone is
    interested, please send me an email at kent.russell at timelyportfolio.com, or
    just look for me at [Google Hangout](https://talkgadget.google.com/hangouts/extras/talk.google.com/timelyportfolio%2520playing%2520in%2520r?authuser=0&hl=en&eid=). 
    I’ll do my first 1/18/2012 from 4:27 pm to 5:00 pm central.

    but unfortunately nobody knew about R or my blog.  Maybe I should switch to an
    unlisted Hangout if that is possible.*'
