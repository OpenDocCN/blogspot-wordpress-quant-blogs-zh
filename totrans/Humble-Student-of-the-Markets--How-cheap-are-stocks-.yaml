    earnings declined. These declines ranged between a low of 7% (for a mild recession
    such as we saw in 1990) and a high of 30.8%, with a 15% fall as a reasonable guide
    as to what a "typical" recession might look like. In all of these cases, except
    for the earnings decline that began in 2006, the peak-to-trough calculation were
    based on one-year changes in earnings. The first average shown in the table excludes
    the 2006-7 and 2006-8 years in order to avoid double and triple counting. The
    average earnings decline excluding the recessionary episode starting in 2006 came
    to -14.8%.

    earnings" is 14.3\. If we were to apply that multiple to a 10%, 15% and 30% decline
    in earnings from current levels due to a recession, we would get targets of 1080
    (-10% from current levels), 1020 (-15%) and 840 (-30%) respectively - a simple
    math calculation.

    in March 2009, it was trading at roughly 10 times trailing earnings. Applying
    that panic bottom earnings multiple of 10 to the 10%, 15% and 30% earnings decline
    scenarios would get us 750 (-37%), 710 (-41%) and 590 (-51%). In a worst case
    analysis, the market could therefore re-test its lows of 2009.

    discounting a slow growth environment, possibly a very mild recession such as
    the 1990 episode. A more typical recession is not in the price.

    of a recession, then you should be more cautious in your equity allocation. Personally,
