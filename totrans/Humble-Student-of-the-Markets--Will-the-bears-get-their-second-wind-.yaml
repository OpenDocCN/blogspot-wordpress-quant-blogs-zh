    of the adverse liquidity effect the Fed removing QE was. As I reviewed the charts
    on the weekend, it became apparent to me that this week coming up could turn out
    to be pivotal in the tug-of-war between the bulls and bears.

    to be a shallow correction or a much deeper one.

    of some of the major sectors of the US stock market shows this to be the case.
    Consumer Discretionary stocks have violated an important relative uptrend against
    the market.

    the effect of heavyweight Apple, has violated a relative support level after rolling
    over out of a relative uptrend. (Believe me, the relative chart of Tech with Apple
    is much, much worse.)

    1\. Based on the experience of the recent past, it seems that the markets have
    an ingrained Pavlovian response that there will be a last minute deal and remain
    relatively complacent about the outcome. I could go on and on about how to analyze
    the politics of sequestration, but I have no idea of the outcome.
