- en: 'in Taki''s magazine is, I think, the best analysis of how we got here, and
    he''s not an economist. When you think about something that gestated for 10 years,
    you get a better sense of how inevitable it was, because the people warning against
    this 10 years ago were all ''proven wrong'' a long time ago. The key is that everyone
    wanted more home ownership, which we know is correlated with all sorts of good
    socioeconomic things: lower crime, more education, etc. But some people are not
    meant to be owners, that is, there is an equilibrium amount of home-owning, and
    it is less than 100%.'
