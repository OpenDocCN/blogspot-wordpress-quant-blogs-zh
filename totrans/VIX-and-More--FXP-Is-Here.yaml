    FXP, the double inverse of the [iShares FTSE/Xinhua China 25 Index (FXI)](http://www.ishares.com/fund_info/detail.jhtml?investorType=INDIV&symbol=FXI&qt=FXI&_requestid=41515),
    has begun trading today. FXP is already showing up in [Yahoo Finance](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=fxp),
    but has yet to appear in Google Finance.

    minutes. Watch the price and the volume on this one.
