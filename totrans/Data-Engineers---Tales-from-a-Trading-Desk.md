## Data Engineers

The refinement of roles and titles in the ‘Big Data’ world continues to evolve.  Previously I blogged about the many roles in the data pipeline engineering world, now Maxime [Beauchemin](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/@maximebeauchemin) adds to the context with an article on “The Rise of the Data Engineer”.

In many scenarios I think the ETL concepts of old are dead.  As I’ve blogged about previous, its more a ELT pipeline, since all raw data is worthy of keeping.

I’d say the below comment is particularly key, especially if you’ve got an efficient Continuous Delivery pipeline:
