    questioned Bernanke this week, and he asked one reasonable question, namely, why
    not break up the top 6 banks if they are all 'too-big-to-fail'. Bernanke said
    he thought incentives in Dodd-Frank would better address the incentive problems.
    I'm not so sure. I would prefer the simplicity of having a maximum asset size
    than the open-ended regulatory gibberish in Dodd-Frank.

    no structure to underwrite or service general loans to businesses. Sanders thought
    that this would be no different than offering back-stop liquidity to banks, oblivious
    to the insanely large amount of infrastructure needed for that to work.

    to appreciate the reasons why markets, and the firms that comprise them, are more
    efficient than government. It reminds me of Lenin's assumption that nationalizing
    industry would be trivial because business was strictly accounting, or more recently,
    the faith in shovel-ready projects. There are many stupid Republicans, but this
    really sets a new bar.
