    one of the puzzles facing investors is why the US equity market testing its all-time
    highs even as the economy suffered its worst setback since the Great Depression.
    This market seems like a Potemkin Village, which shows an external façade of calm
    while hiding the real trouble behind the scenes.

    steps to stabilize markets so they can function in an orderly way. A Fed Put can
    put a floor on prices, but it cannot make asset prices skyrocket the way they
    did.

    support growth. This recession is completely unlike past slowdowns. The government's
    safety net has allowed consumers to maintain their spending to prevent a complete
    collapse in demand.

    a significant downside risk to our growth outlook,” JPMorgan Chase chief U.S.
    economist Michael Feroli wrote in a Monday note. “These executive orders likely
    will provide stimulus of less than $100 billion, while we have been expecting
    Congress to add at least $1.0-1.5 trillion of spending once an agreement is reached.”

    is inadequate, legally questionable and falls dramatically short of the booster
    shot the economy desperately needs,” per a note from senior U.S. economist Lydia
    Boussour. “In the absence of a more comprehensive stimulus package, economic activity
    will be constrained just as the recovery plateaus.”

    cases even more -- of their revenue from abroad. Beyond that, the pandemic lockdown
    in the U.S. has benefitted the giant tech companies’ sales and profits. No wonder
    the Nasdaq Composite 100 Index, which is dominated by big tech companies, is up
    about 26% this year.

    and they would be up more than 37% for the year. Do the same for the next 490
    names in the index, and they are down about 7.7%. That shows just how much a few
    giants matter to the index.

    are no longer tethered to reality because the performance doesn’t correspond to
    their personal experience, which is one of job loss, economic hardship and personal
    despair. But what’s important to understand is that indexes based on market-cap
    weighting can be -- as they are now -- driven by the gains of just a handful of
    companies.
