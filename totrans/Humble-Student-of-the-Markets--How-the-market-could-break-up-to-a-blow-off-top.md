# Humble Student of the Markets: How the market could break up to a blow-off top

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2023/05/how-market-could-break-up-to-blow-off.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2023/05/how-market-could-break-up-to-blow-off.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models** 

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post, 

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The 

**Trend Asset Allocation Model**

 is an asset allocation model that applies trend-following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity prices. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. The performance and full details of a model portfolio based on the out-of-sample signals of the Trend Model can be found

[here](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/trend-model-report-card/)

.

My inner trader uses a 

**trading model**

, which is a blend of price momentum (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa). Subscribers receive real-time alerts of model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of the email alerts is updated weekly 

[here](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/trading-track-record/)

. The hypothetical trading record of the trading 

model of the real-time alerts that began in March 2016 is shown below.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Sell equities*
*   Trend Model signal: Neutral*
*   Trading model: Bullish*

** The performance chart and model readings have been delayed by a week out of respect to our paying subscribers.***Update schedule**

: I generally update model readings on my 

[site](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/)

 on weekends. I am also on Twitter at @humblestudent and on Mastodon at @humblestudent@toot.community. Subscribers receive real-time alerts of trading model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of those email alerts is shown

**A tight trading range**

The S&P 500 has been mired in two trading ranges for several weeks. The smaller range is defined by 4050–4180 (grey zone), and the larger one is defined by 3800–4180\. Neither the bulls nor the bears have been able to break through.

I outlined the intermediate-term bearish market structure exhibited by the market last week and I stand by those remarks (see [What market structure tells us about where we are in the cycle](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2023/05/07/what-market-structure-tells-us-about-where-we-are-in-the-cycle/)). While this is not my base case, I am starting to warm to the scenario of an upside breakout to a blow-off top, followed by a market collapse soon afterwards. As they say, don't sell a dull market short.
