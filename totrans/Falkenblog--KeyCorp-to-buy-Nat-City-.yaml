- en: When I was a risk manager at KeyCorp in the 1990's, it was really a two-bank
    town, National City and Key. Because of Key's penchant to buy things for, oh,
    $700MM that were really worth $150MM, Nat City generally generally outperformed
    when I was there. But things changed, and as Nat City didn't do well in the last
    recession, the recent slump put a knife in their heart.

    of inefficiency, lots of Dilbert-style managers who knew very little about their
    jobs. But as I found when I went to work in the New York, and talked to other
    banks, I found that is is true at every big bank, even the ones in London and
    New York. In fact, the banks that had big, high profile investment arms tended
    to really not understand the bread and butter commercial and consumer lending
    as well, because investment banking dominated their view of things, and so up
    top you had people with no intuition for basic regional banking (commercial and
    consumer lending is not like running a portfolio of traded securities, or facilitating
    an IPO), and their best people all wanted to be on the cover of Intitutional Investor
    (i.e., investment bankers).

- en: Nat City in the end. They have weathered the recent storm better than most (due
    to legacy principles I instilled in their risk management, of course!). I remember
    thinking, as the subprime disaster was happening, that we never made loans like
    that when I was there (no money down, reverse principal amortizing, no income
    verification), and I guess they still don't to any significant degree.

- en: Speaking of banking, it was funny when in Bernanke's testimony today, they talked
    about some ideas for regulating sub-prime, and Bernanke said, well, the problem
    loans in question can't be securitized anymore. Meaning, that mistake, subprime
    residential, is, like all excesses, a one-timer. Regulators are always focusing
    on the mistakes of the immediate past, and five years after the fact they have
    new legislation focused like a laser beam on, say lending to telecoms with inflated
    income statements. The next bust is never like the last, except in the broad sense
    that people expected certain collateral to stay stable, if not keep going up.
    But it was hotels and commercial real estate in 1990, telecom in 2001, and now
    residential mortgages. I guarantee the next bust will not be in telecom or residential
    mortgages because the experience of failure is just too fresh in the participant's
    minds.
