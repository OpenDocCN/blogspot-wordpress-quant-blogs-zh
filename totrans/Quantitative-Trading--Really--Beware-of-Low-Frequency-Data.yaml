    is another brilliant example that I came across recently.

    there are many days with significant deviation from the straight line. The trader

    buy equal dollar amount of USO and DNO when the sum of their daily returns is
    less than 40 bps at the market close, hold one day, and vice versa - we will find
    a strategy with a decent Sharpe ratio of 1 even after deducting 5 bps per side
    as transaction costs. Here is the equity curve:'

    trade, but that there was seldom any trade triggered. When the daily EOD data
    suggests a trade should be triggered, the 1-min bar BBO data tells us that in
    fact there was no deviation from the mean.

    costs of occasionally shorting these ETFs. The "rebate rate" for USO is about
    1% per annum on Interactive Brokers, but a steep 5.6% for DNO.)
