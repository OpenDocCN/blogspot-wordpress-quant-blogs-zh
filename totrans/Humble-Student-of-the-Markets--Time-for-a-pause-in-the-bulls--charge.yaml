    a little extended in the short run and due for a brief period of consolidation.
    The SPX broke out from its inverse head and shoulders (IHS) pattern this week,
    cleared its 50 day moving average (dma), and filled in the gap from March 22\.

    resistance defined by the highs set in late February and March.'
