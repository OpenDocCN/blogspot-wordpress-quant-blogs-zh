    the [VXO](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXO), but given all the
    confusion I have seen in the media over new VIX records, I think it is time to
    offer up some history that may help clarify the situation.

    Everyone Should Know About the VIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/04/ten-things-everyone-should-know-about.html).
    For the visual learners out there, I have reduced the history of the VIX and the
    VXO to a graphical timeline below. Here are some of the important facts in a nutshell:'

- en: Data from the new 2003 VIX formula has been assigned the VIX ticker, but the
    CBOE published a reconstruction of historical data for the new VIX formulation
    going back to 1990

- en: At the same time, the data (both historical and subsequent) associated with
    the ‘original VIX’ formula was assigned a new VXO ticker
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The result is that for all practical purposes when you or your data provider
    refer to the VIX, this means the new 2003 VIX calculation and the historical reconstruction
    of the data for the new VIX formula. Similarly, the VXO ticker refers to VXO data
    from 2003 to the present, ‘original VIX’ data from 1993 to 2003, and a historical
    reconstruction of ‘original VIX’ data that goes back to 1986.

    but a historical reconstruction of the VXO arrives at an intra-day high of 152.48
    and closing value of 150.19 for [Black Monday](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Black%20Monday),
    October 19, 1987 as well as an all-time high intra-day VXO of 172.79 for October
    20, 1987\. The chart below details the action in the historical reconstruction
    of the VXO for the period from October 1987 to March 1988, when the VXO finally
    slid back below 30.
