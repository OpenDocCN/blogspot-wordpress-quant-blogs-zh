- en: he devotes a chapter to “Up Days In A Row vs. Down Days In A Row”. He looks
    at how the market has performed after it has moved in one direction for 1, 2,
    or 3 days in a row. Because of the long-term upward drift of the stock market,
    very few of the studies published in the book show much of a negative tendency.
    One situation that showed a negative tendency over the following 1, 2, and 5 day
    periods was when the market was trading below its 200-day moving average and had
    posted three higher closes. (This happened today.)

    were 7/29/04, 8/17/04, 8/26/04, and 11/29/07\. So Larry’s data for this study
    remains pretty current.

    on direction, but downside risks were higher than upside rewards giving the next
    1-5 days a negative expectancy.

- en: This study on its own is not a reason to sell short. It should serve as a caution
    though for those holding long positions. Rallies during longer-term downtrends
    are not normally very persistent. Long-side traders will many times shorten their
    time frames while short-sellers use the bounces as an opportunity to add more
    short exposure - all causing a lot of backing and filling. Also note that two
    of the highest volume days of the last two and a half weeks were on January 31st
    and February 1st. A lot of people bought a lot of stock on those two days. They’ve
    been underwater ever since. After three up days in a row, the market has moved
    back into the middle of the range of those two days. We may see a lot of folks
    here that are relieved to be able to get out near breakeven on their purchases.
    This should create some additional selling pressure.

    traders could consider taking a shot short here soon if they’re able to find a
    favorable entrypoint.
