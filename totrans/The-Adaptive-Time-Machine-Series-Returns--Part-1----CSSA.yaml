    support are much appreciated.  Getting back to the subject matter–The Adaptive
    Time Machine– the first installment is about examining the original algorithm
    to understand where it can be improved. Quantum Financier did a good series recap
    on the time machine and also tested out the original algorithm on various markets:

    of selecting from 50 different runs-based strategies. The entry run was between
    1-5 days in length, while the exit run was also between 1-5 days in length. Mean-reversion
    type run strategies entered on a down run of “n” days and exiting on an up run
    of “n” days. This produced 25 different combinations of long/short strategies.
    Trend-type strategies entered on an up run of “n” days and exited on a down run
    of “n” days–also producing 25 different combinations of long/short strategies
    for a total of 50\. It was shown that selecting strategies with increasingly high
    levels of confidence generated superior returns than each prior group, and significantly
    outperformed buy and hold. This algorithm was able to adapt to changing market
    environments over time.

    across instruments,  in many different  markets it struggled to beat buy and hold
    and in some cases even under-performed. The question is why?  The most obvious
    problem with the original algorithm is with the strategy selection criteria itself.
     First of all, the problem with using runs is twofold: 1) run frequency changes
    over time- there is both intra-year variation and secular shifts in run frequency
    across years 2) run frequency varies significantly by instrument which limits
    adaptation. As a simple example, a strategy that goes long on a 3-day run down,
    and exits on a 5-day run up will experience periods where it is completely inactive
    or even worse stuck waiting for an exit. If this strategy was selected prior to
    going into a deep bear market, it is possible that no significant up run would
    materialize for a month or more.  In addition, the frequency of long runs either
    up or down have shrunk over the last few decades, and this transition greatly
    impacts the bias in strategy selection—we may end up selecting a strategy that
    is no longer regularly active. Furthermore, in relation to different markets,
    while a run of 4 or 5 is very rare for the S&P500, it may be quite common  with
    different commodities or currencies. The best solution to this problem: **a normalized
    up and down run indicator using (what else?) the 252-day percentrank!**'

    which assumes normality and independence–both highly flawed assumptions with time
    series data. The use of non-parametric statistics are slightly better, but they
    lack the statistical power of more rigorous tests like the bootstrap or the monte
    carlo simulation as popularized by David Aronson in **Evidence-Based Technical
    Analysis**. This book is well worth reading, and provides the requisite dose of
    rigor and skepticism into a world filled with snake oil. Implementing and adapting
    these tests for hypothesis testing  is well beyond the scope of this blog and
    is something we have invested a fair bit of time on internally at CSS.  Truthfully
    the simple t-test, or a regression-based t-test will have to suffice for most
    traders since conducting the above tests is both complex and computer-intensive.
    One important point is that many strategies will have greater than 95% confidence,
    and what was sorely lacking in the time machine was a performance selection criterion
    to isolate the best of the strategies that already pass the confidence test. To
    improve upon the existing framework we will use a fancy new statistic called **“Omega”**
    to select strategies, which is essentially a distribution-based measure of upside
    versus downside. The Omega is by itself very useful for different  applications
    and will be introduced in a post later this summer.

- en: Finally, the last problem with the time machine pertains to the use of long/short
    strategies. If a market is perpetually rising, short strategies may not be very
    profitable and will obscure the strength of its long-side cousin. The converse
    will happen when the market is falling. This makes it more difficult to adapt
    to what is working, and also less flexible.  The best way to solve this issue
    is to have long only strategies, short only strategies, and also long/short strategies.
     This provides maximum flexibility for strategy selection. Next week I will begin
    presenting some of the refinements and spend time developing the new and improved
    algorithm. Stay tuned!
