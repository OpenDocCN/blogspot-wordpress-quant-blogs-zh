    Put Writing Strategy](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/01/often-overlooked-put-writing-strategy.html),
    particularly in some of the comments at Seeking Alpha, where the post was [republished](http://seekingalpha.com/article/114076-put-writing-too-often-overlooked).
    A number of questions came up regarding the reasons why two strategies that are
    synthetically equivalent (i.e. share the same profit and loss graph), would have
    different performance characteristics. I cited the main reason for the performance
    delta as the skew that results from a tendency to price puts higher than calls,
    particularly during times of extreme market stress, when demand for puts often
    exceeds the demand for calls.

    in this space, but I did assemble two performance graphs that might help to inform
    any further discussion. Using the CBOE PutWrite Index ([PUT](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/PUT))
    and the CBOE BuyWrite Index ([BXM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/BXM))
    as my source data, I have plotted the two indices from their 1988 inception (above)
    and from 2002 (below), when the indices begin to substantially diverge.

- en: From the two graphs, I find it interesting that the [put-write](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/put-write)
    strategy begins to generate separation from the [buy-write](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/buy-write)
    strategy during the 2002-07 bull market. As volatility increases during 2007,
    the put-write strategy continues to widen the gap, with the recent bear market
    having very little impact on the performance differential between the strategies.

    during different market cycles, please feel free to chime in.
