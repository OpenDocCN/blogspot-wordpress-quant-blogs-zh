    mid-thread.   I’ve become extraordinarily busy with a new company, but will revert
    to research mode and follow-up once things settle down.

     These are interesting because are probably most complex systems we can study.
      Our understanding of specific cells and interactions has grown enormously within
    a century, but we’re still only scratching the surface given crude measurement
    tools and the mind boggling complexity.   Computational biology provides a simulation
    based approach to studying these problems, and hence is of particular interest
    to me.

    success with creating structures and processes based on metal salts as an alternative
    to carbon forms: [ Life cells made of metal](http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20906-lifelike-cells-are-made-of-metal.html).
      It seems like they have been able to create cell-like structures and may be
    close to a means of generating energy for the entity via photosynthesis.   Whether
    this is a fruitful or not, remains to be seen.'
