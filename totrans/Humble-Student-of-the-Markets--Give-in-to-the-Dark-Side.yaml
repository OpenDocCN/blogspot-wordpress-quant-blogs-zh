    for the financials. The real walk on the Dark Side is to buy the large cap financials,
    not despite, but because of their propensity for financial shenanigans. Consider
    this chart of the relative performance of the financials against the market. This
    sector broke out of a long-term relative downtrend in early 2012 and they have
    begun a relative uptrend.
