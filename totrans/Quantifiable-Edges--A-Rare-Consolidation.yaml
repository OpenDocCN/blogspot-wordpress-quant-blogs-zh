- en: On Tuesday I discussed the 3/10 Offset HV indicator.  I used it to measure when
    a market has become so coiled that is is likely to have a sharp move.  We have
    a very unusual situation right now in that the 3/10 Offset HV has closed at a
    very low level for 4 days in a row.  I decided to run a test last night to look
    at other times SPX’s 3/10 Offset HV closed below 0.3 for 4 days in a row. I also
    filtered using the short and long-term trend. Results are below.

    Below is a listing of all 20 instances going back to 1960.

    of the instances took place in the 60s and 70s. Also, this is the 1st instance
    in over 14 years. Personally, I’m not terribly comfortable using a study whose
    results are primarily achieved during the 60s and 70s and with no instances since
    ’96\. Therefore I decided not to include it when formulating my outlook.

- en: Many more studies lead to dead ends than lead to quantifiable edges.  When deciding
    what to include in your analysis, it is important to be intellectually honest
    with yourself.  Traders should look to trade aggressively when  edges strongly
    suggest a bias.  It is just as important to remain patient and conserve capital
    when evidence is mixed or lacking.
