    Reserve on Wednesday and the ECB on Thursday. Both are widely expected to raise
    rates. However, market expectations for the trajectory of the U.S. Fed Funds rate
    is a 25-basis-point hike at the May meeting, a pause, and rate cuts later in the
    year. By contrast the ECB is expected to continue hiking.

    not appear to be complete. The governing council is reportedly split between a
    25-basis point and a 50-basis point hike at the May meeting. ECB board member
    Isabel Schnabel told Politico in an interview that underlying inflation, which
    filters out volatile food and energy prices, shows very strong momentum and it
    was not clear that it would peak “very soon”. Belgium’s central bank head and
    ECB setting governing council member Pierre Wunsch told the Financial Times in
    an interview: “We are waiting for wage growth and core inflation to go down, along
    with headline inflation, before we can arrive at the point where we can pause.”'

- en: The Fed hates to surprise markets. A 25-basis-point rate hike is a virtual certainty.
    Unless it doesn’t plan to pause increases after the May meeting, it will signal
    its intention next week, subject to the usual caveats about data dependency. The
    challenge for investors is how to position themselves should the Fed pause.
