    ETPs in 2016 was much more balanced and in line with historical norms.  While
    there were some sharp VIX spikes, the combination

    for the inverse VIX ETPs.  The more complex multi-leg, long-short and dynamic
    VIX strategy ETPs were closest to breaking even for the year, with half of these
    posting modest gains and half posting small losses.

    ETPs with respect to leverage and maturity, using leverage on the y-axis and maturity
    on the x-axis.  This group includes five VIX strategy ETPs that have no easily
    discernible point on the leverage-maturity grid.  Depending on how finely you
    wish to split hairs, these twenty ETPs account for anywhere from fourteen to eighteen
    unique ways to trade volatility long and short, across various maturities and
    according to a wide variety of strategic approaches.

    VMIN was launched on May 2, 2016 and outperformed both XIV and SVXY from the launch
    date until the end of the year, racking up an impressive 80.5% return in just
    eights months of trading.  Going forward, I would expect VMIN to regularly be
    the top performer in any period in which the inverse ETPs post positive returns.

    underlying volatility index due to the lack of daily rebalancing.  As a result,
    these have become almost entirely all-cash vehicles, with a dash of volatility.
