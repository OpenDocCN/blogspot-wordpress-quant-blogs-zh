    wrote a great thought piece [Cash as Trash, Cash as King, and Cash as a Weapon](http://blogs.cfainstitute.org/insideinvesting/2012/11/05/cash-as-trash-cash-as-king-and-cash-as-a-weapon/)
    for the CFA Institute blog.  My favorite part comes in the last paragraph:'

    not simple sayings that bounce back and forth in response to the mood of the market.
    Individual investors should not be afraid to hold cash, even when it’s earning
    little, if it’s available to them when needed most. And investment professionals
    should get away from misguided notions about how much cash is too much cash in
    a portfolio. Let the manager use the value and power of cash to execute a strategy.
    Then you can judge whether the strategy makes sense. Don’t remove cash as an effective
    weapon.”

    of opportunity lost (opportunity cost or “cash as trash”) or does it represent
    opportunity gained (Buffett’s cash as a “call option” as described in the solid
    Globe and Mail [article](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/investment-ideas/streetwise/for-warren-buffett-the-cash-option-is-priceless/article4565468/)). 
    I hope those who know me or read this blog know where I stand.  Cash is a refuge
    in the absence of opportunity, and I plan to spend significant time over the next
    couple months exploring how to mathematically price cash as a call option. If
    anyone has attempted this or read any research, please share it with me.

    confronted with something that I should have already known.  If you compare the
    1 year US Treasury (not really cash but close enough) with just the price return
    of the S&P 500 starting from 1960, the price only S&P 500 is extraordinarily unremarkable.

    research ["Glidepath Illusion"](http://researchaffiliates.com/ideas/pdf/fundamentals/Fundamentals_Sep_2012_The_Glidepath_Illusion.pdf). 
    Certainly commonly accepted “wisdom” does not seem so wise.
