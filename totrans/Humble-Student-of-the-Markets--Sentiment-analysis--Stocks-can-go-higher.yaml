    which indicated that individual investor equity allocations are at post-Crisis
    highs - a crowded long reading. As an aside, I find the AAII asset allocation
    survey to be more useful than the sentiment survey, because this is a case of
    watching what they do (asset allocation), not just what they say (sentiment).

    that is a positive signal for equities. A net 16 percent of asset allocators say
    they are overweight cash, up from a net 9 percent in November. The higher cash
    levels coincide with expectations of higher interest rates and a belief by three-quarters

    are significantly overweight European and Japanese equities and overweight US
    equities, though not at excessive levels. The US equity overweight is barely 0.5
    standard deviations above its historical mean, which is just noise.

    portfolios into a higher equity allocation, US stock prices appear to have further
    room to run in the next few months. By mid-year, institutional buying will likely
    have pushed stock prices higher and moved fund managers closer to a crowded long
    position. Should those events transpire, my base scenario of a strong first half
