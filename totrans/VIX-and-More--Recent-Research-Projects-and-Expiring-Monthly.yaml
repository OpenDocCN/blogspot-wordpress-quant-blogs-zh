    I neglected to mention my contributions to [*Expiring Monthly: The Option Traders
    Journal*](http://www.expiringmonthly.com/), where I tend to publish some of my
    proprietary research and analysis in a somewhat longer form (1000-4000 words)
    than I do in this space.'

    on what I have been thinking about and writing for the magazine as of late, I
    thought that as the second year of *Expiring Monthly* has just concluded, it might
    be interesting to list all the titles of the 42 articles I have written for the
    magazine to give readers a sense of some of my more detailed research interests.

    Monthly* in chronological order, up to and including *Calculating the Future Range
    of the VIX*, which was part of the February 2012 issue that was published last
    week.

    which first appeared in the December 2010 edition of *Expiring Monthly*, in this
    space. [The Education of a Trader](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/09/education-of-trader.html),
    which also originated at *Expiring Monthly* in our editorial Back Page column,
    was republished here as well. Going forward, I think I will start pulling additional
    articles from the *[Expiring Monthly archives](http://www.expiringmonthly.com/archives.html)*
    (perhaps 1-2 articles per year that are at least one year past publication) and
    see if they can find a wider audience here. Given all the recent interest in hedging,
    something like *Cheating with Partial Hedges* is certainly a candidate for finding
    its way onto these pages.
