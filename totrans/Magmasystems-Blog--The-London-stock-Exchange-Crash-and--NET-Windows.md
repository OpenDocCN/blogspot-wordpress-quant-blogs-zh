# Magmasystems Blog: The London stock Exchange Crash and .NET/Windows

> 来源：[http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2008/09/london-stock-exchange-crash-and.html#0001-01-01](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2008/09/london-stock-exchange-crash-and.html#0001-01-01)

I have been on the receiving side of some good-natured ribbing inside of my company in the wake of the

[LSE crash](http://blogs.computerworld.com/london_stock_exchange_suffers_net_crash)

and the suspected involvement of .NET and Windows. Our Complex Event Processing System, one of the most strategic projects in our company, runs totally on Windows 2003/64-bit and .NET 3.5\. It is one of the highest-profile usages of .NET in one of the largest financial institutions in the world.

Microsoft has been

[very public](http://download.microsoft.com/download/3/a/0/3a0b6465-a87c-45c0-92c8-4cfd8b4415b6/LSE_WinServ03_Final.doc)

is touting the fact that the

LSE

is a heavy user of .NET. But, from what I can tell, there hasn't been a peep out of Microsoft in defending their platforms in the wake of the

LSE

debacle. Speculation has pointed to problems with

Cisco

, problems with

SQL

Server 2000, problems with the code written by

Accenture

consultants, and problems with Sarah

Palin

.

I have been vocal on my blog in the past about the viability of Windows and .NET as a platform for real-time trading applications. I have never seen Microsoft come out with a definitive

roadmap

for using its platforms for

realtime

trading apps. No benchmarks against

Realtime

Linux. No attempts to through

OPRA

feeds at a Microsoft Server.

Sure, there is some good stuff going on at Microsoft with their grid efforts, but that effort will be the most beneficial to risk and analytics. Things like Velocity Object Caches and SSDS are a lot of fun. Excel is everywhere. But, the core operating system is Microsoft's bread and butter.

We need Microsoft to defend the

LSE's

use of Windows and .NET, and we need Microsoft to address viability of using its platform for low-latency, high-bandwidth trading apps.

At the

Stac

Council meeting in July, the companies who gave presentations about using their platforms for trading apps included IBM, Sun, and HP. Where was Microsoft? Why aren't they involved in the

Stac

Council?
