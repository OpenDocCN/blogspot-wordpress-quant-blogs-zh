    than 100 days in negative territory. Hickey contends the move suggests investors

    stocks will rip higher.

    later, the S&P was higher four out of five times,” Hickey told CNBC’s “Trading

    which is the tendency of two variables that are closely correlated but have different
    effects. One example of multicollinearity is a person's height and weight. One
    way of addressing this problem is to isolate the "pure" effect of a signal from
    its "naive" multicollinear effect.
