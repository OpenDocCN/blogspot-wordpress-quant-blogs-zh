    with SEC regs and compatible with common practical restrictions imposed by broker
    counterparties. This model and corresponding background will be presented in parts
    over several posts, given its non-trivial scope.

    brief review of the existing literature. A second post will describe the model,
    provide practical R code, and generate results by applying it to a representative
    equity. For those familiar with portfolio optimization, this model is reminiscent
    of [Black-Litterman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Litterman_model)
    as it depends upon “views” of the underlying stock.

    trades between plan and absence of a plan*. In other words, the benchmark for
    evaluating a plan is what would happen if the holder was not subject to a plan.
    This makes sense, as a plan effectively serves as a trading constraint (a *portfolio
    constraint*, of sorts), as the execution rule(s) for all trades must be specified
    in advance.

    and build a plan which maximizes corresponding profit. This approach is sufficient

    as optimal stopping for each share to be monetized along that process*. Although
    not necessarily a [martingale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martingale_%28probability_theory%29),
    this process can be assumed one given the holder must decide on plan prior to
    observing any realizations of the process. Also, this model is defined on real
    probability measure ![\mathbb{P}](img/f2d0e071de256bbddee88d21a6582414.png) (not
    risk-neutral ![\mathbb{Q}](img/969ce5c634b2b4963929a6476f8ccc63.png)), as the
    market faced by the holder is *incomplete* due to legal constraints on short selling
    and trading derivatives.

    will be through a pragmatic lens. In short, the literature is thin, devoid of
    practical examples, and written by well-intended academics clearly unfamiliar
    with the realities of monetization. From [People of Quant Research](https://quantivity.wordpress.com/2011/03/06/people-of-quant-research/),
    the only two academics whose primary research focus includes executive stock options
    are [Henderson](http://www.oxford-man.ox.ac.uk/people/members_henderson.html)
    and [Carpenter](http://people.stern.nyu.edu/jcarpen0/); from the accounting world,

    practice of monetization was nearly impossible because nobody wanted to talk due
    to concern of insufficient affirmative defense against insider trading. Thus,
    monetization practice fell into two camps: the masses traded idiosyncratically
    in open windows and more sophisticated folks with sufficient notional executed
    OTC strategies (primarily [PVFs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_prepaid_forward_contract)
    and [ZCCs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collar_%28finance%29)). This changed in
    2000, with the enactment of [10b5-1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEC_Rule_10b5-1)
    providing affirmative defense for trades conducted via *mechanical* plan specified
    in advance. Hence the modern era of monetization began, with obvious alignment
    to quant finance and algorithmic trading.'
