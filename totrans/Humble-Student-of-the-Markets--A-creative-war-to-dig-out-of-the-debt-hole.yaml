    substantially after defaults. In the Volatility Machine, Michael Pettis asserts
    that sovereign default contagion follows predictable patterns, and that contagion
    is primarily due to investors in the first defaulting country also having investments
    in other countries which are vulnerable. This is especially the case with leveraged
    investors.

    US. In fact, every time something blows up somewhere, Treasuries have rallied.

    observers have pointed out that the US debt to GDP ratio has been higher than
    they are today. It is also instructive to go back to an earlier era to learn about
    how Britain dug itself out of her debt hole after the Napoleonic Wars.

    and progressed to the British Raj. Simply put, the British went to India and took
    things as part of their colonial adventures.
