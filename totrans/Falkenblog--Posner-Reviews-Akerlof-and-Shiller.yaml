    believe that being rational is the same as being right. That is a mistake. It
    prevents them from entertaining the possibility that what has now plunged the
    world into depression is a cascade of mistakes by rational businessmen, government
    officials, academic economists, consumers, and homebuyers, operating in an unexpectedly
    fragile economic environment, and that what is retarding recovery is not the "unreasoning
    fear" of which Franklin Roosevelt famously spoke but the rational fears--the reasoning
    fear, to use Roosevelt's idiom--of businesspeople, consumers, and officials who
    confront economic uncertainties for which no one had prepared them.

    or greed versus an unintentioned, reasonable error. I was not following this in
    real time, but putting myself back into 2006 I can empathize with those convinced
    by the absence of historical losses in the face of easier credit terms. I would
    like to think I would have noted that the recent housing spike made things much
    different, but I can see how that view would be a minority one (remember, even
    Shiller did not suggest a nation-wide housing price collapse was probable).

    to think everything happens because of some kind of big plan. But broad trends
    are usually not the sum of their parts. They reflect an equilibrium of deeper
    preferences and productivity. Understanding the trends and breakpoints in an economy,
    is best done assuming people are neither idiots nor evil, merely imperfect. Bad
    faith and stupidity explain a lot of specific trades or litigation, but they don't
    generalize well because people tend to be mean or stupid in idiosyncratic ways.
