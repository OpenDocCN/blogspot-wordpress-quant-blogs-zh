- en: This story of only 338 words focuses on a young boy named Max who, after dressing
    in his wolf costume, wreaks such havoc through his household that he is sent to
    bed without his supper. Max's bedroom undergoes a mysterious transformation into
    a jungle environment, and he winds up sailing to an island inhabited by malicious
    beasts known as the "Wild Things." After successfully intimidating the creatures,
    Max is hailed as the king of the Wild Things and enjoys a playful romp with his
    subjects. However, he starts to feel lonely and decides to return home, to the
    Wild Things' dismay. Upon returning to his bedroom, Max discovers a hot supper
    waiting for him.

    investors is what part of the story we are at. Are we at the stage where Max is
    romping with the Wild Things, or is Max about to leave the island, where the Wild
    Things threw their final tantrum by roaring their terrible roars, and showed their
    terrible teeth (FANGs)?
