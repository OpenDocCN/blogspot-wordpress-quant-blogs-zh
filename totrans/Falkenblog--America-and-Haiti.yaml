    clearly an issue. Property rights are weak in Haiti, so no one has an incentive
    to cultivate or protect land, and so it turns into a literal sewer. The January
    earthquake has highlighted this problem, as to date very little debris has been
    moved

    will exacerbate inequality. The solution, that no one, or 'the state' owns it,

    are non-recourse: the bank has no ''recourse'' to go after a borrower if he doesn''t
    pay his mortgage, merely take the property. But this seizing of collateral takes
    12 to 24 months given all the rules designed to protect homeowners. The result
    are many properties in foreclosure have no one managing them who wants to maximize
    their value. Indeed, the homeowner sure to default can cannibalize the house,
    ripping out $2 worth of fixtures and selling them at $1\. Such venal behavior
    would be immediately condemned by politicians and journalists if it were done
    by banks, but because individuals are doing it there''s no outrage. Here''s a
    case where giving bankers more power would greatly improve neighborhoods. The'

    heard banging from outside. From her window, Clarke could see workers hauling
    doors, leaded glass windows and even a built-in buffet out of the century-old
    home next door.
