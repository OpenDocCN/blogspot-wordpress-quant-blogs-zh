    Nasdaq. The results suggested more downside was likely in the weeks and months
    to come. There was 3 criteria for the setup. Surprisingly, the 3rd criteria was
    not met last week. “3) The difference between the current NYSE/Nasdaq ratio and
    the 10-week EMA must be at its widest point in the last 5 weeks. (The red line
    must be farther below the yellow line than it has been in at least 5 weeks.)”
    Updated chart as of 2/29/08 below:'

    ratio must be at least 3.0% below the 10-week EMA. (The red line must be 3.0%
    or more below the yellow line.)

    short-term highs while the Nasdaq is lagging badly, it normally means the NYSE
    will succumb to the will of the Nasdaq. Like the original study, the expectation
    over the next 1-10 weeks is negative.
