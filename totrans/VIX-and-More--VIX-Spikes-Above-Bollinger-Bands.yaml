    [10 day simple moving average](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/10%20day%20SMA).
    As noted on a number of occasions here, when the VIX is at least 10% above its
    10 day SMA, this is usually a good time to initiate a short-term [mean reversion](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/mean%20reversion)
    play and go long the SPX and/or short the VIX.

    reversion signal can be derived from using [Bollinger bands](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Bollinger%20bands)
    to determine when the VIX is overextended and likely to snap back. The simplest
    approach is to monitor when the VIX closes above the upper band of a 20 day, 2
    standard deviation lookback period.

- en: The chart below uses the standard 20 day, 2 standard deviation Bollinger bands
    to evaluate the moves in the VIX during the past year. Note that following the
    largest sustained VIX spike ever – during September and October of last year –
    it has been relatively rare for the VIX to close above the upper band. There was
    one instance of a close well above the upper band in January that marked a short-term
    bullish move, then there were two closes above the upper band at the end of February
    and the beginning of March that preceded the market bottom and strong bounce.

    substantial breach and suggests a short-term bullish bias. Given the narrowing
    [Bollinger band width](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Bollinger%20band%20width)
    (bottom study), however, it obviously took a much smaller move to penetrate the
    upper band than it did in January, when the VIX was hovering around 50.

    is how much of a pullback it will take to satisfy the bears and how soon it will
    be until the buy-on-the-dip mentality begins to dominate again.
