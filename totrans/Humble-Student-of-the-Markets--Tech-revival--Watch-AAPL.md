> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2013/05/tech-revival-watch-aapl.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2013/05/tech-revival-watch-aapl.html#0001-01-01)

There was some excitement this week about the relative breakout of the Technology sector against the market:

Given the dominant weight of Apple in the Technology sector, consider the relative performance of an equal weighted Tech index. the equal-weighted NASDAQ 100 (QQEW) against the SPX. While the XLK has rallied out of a relative downtrend against SPX, QQEW remains range-bound against the market. In other words, the average Tech stpcl has performed in line with the market in general.

The rally out of the downtrend is far more evident in AAPL:

So if you start to get excited about the potential rally in Technology stocks, pick the appropriate benchmark and know what you are betting on.
