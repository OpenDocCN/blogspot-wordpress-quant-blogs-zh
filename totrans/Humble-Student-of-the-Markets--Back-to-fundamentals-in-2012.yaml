    slip and slide all over the place. The quarterback has trouble throwing the ball.
    Receivers can't grip thrown balls. Running backs are virtually skating on the
    field and can only occasionally get good footing. Kickers can't judge the wind
    as it shifts at a moment's notice.

    in the first half of the year and trendless and marked by extreme volatility in
    the second half. Investable swings, shown in red, were few in number. Many of
    the swings seen in the second half, shown in green, lasted less than a week –
    and woe to anyone who tried to invest on news flow in the second half as whipsaw
    would be the inevitable result.

    politics and policy, not fundamental and economics, drove market returns. The
    market began to worry about an extreme tail-risk, or black swan, event such as
    a Lehman-like crisis in the second half of 2011\. Every news headline moved the

    among asset classes and a temperament of “risk on/risk off” among investors. This
    phenomenon can be traced to the connectedness of markets, the ease by which market
    participants can access these connected markets, and the speed of assimilation
    of information in response to political events. (See V. Bhansali, The Ps of Pricing
    and Risk Management, Revisited, Journal of Portfolio Management, Vol. 36, No.
    2, Winter 2010.) This environment creates the possibility of multiple equilibria
    in the market, as well as trends that move markets between these equilibria, and
    once settled, restraining forces that trap markets in those equilibria (See V.
    Bhansali, Market Crises -- Can the Physics of Phase Transitions and Symmetry Breaking
    Tell Us Anything Useful?, Journal of Investment Management, 2009).

    real-time evolution of the interaction between markets and policy, we can still
    ask an important question: What would happen if the distribution of returns from
    a hypothetical portfolio looked more like the one shown in the chart on the right
    of Figure 1, i.e. a “bimodal” distribution with more than one peak? The bimodal
    distribution has two peaks, and interestingly, even though it is generated as
    the result of mixing two normal distributions, each from a different regime, it
    can exhibit both fat tails (a higher probability of larger losses due to unusual
    events results in a “fat tail” on the left side of the distribution curve) and
    skewness (a lack of symmetry between the left and right sides of the peak).'

    a bell-shaped distribution, like the figure above on left. In the current environment
    where investors oscillate between a “risk-on” and “risk-off” trade, the true distribution
    may look like one with two peaks like the figure on the right. Under these circumstances,
    techniques used to manage funds assuming a bell-shaped distribution will not work
    in a multiple equilibrium world (like 2011).

    The financial market was largely driven by European news in 2011 as it was concerned
    the possibility of a Lehman-like market crash. When the news flow indicated that
    the Financial Apocalypse might be near, stocks sold off. When the European governments

    In 2008, the markets were concerned about the housing collapse and its effects

    housing market hasn’t gone away, nor have the concerns about the weakness of the
