    line is that the correct bet is to be long the markets right now in the short-term
    (read 1-5 days).  You would have to possess a lot of persuasive evidence  that
    I certainly have not seen to convince me otherwise. Ultimately from all the sources
    I have read or perused–both quantitative and qualitative,  the odds strongly favor
    a bounce from this point. So what does this mean? It surely does not mean that
    a bounce must happen, nor does it mean that I will be right. Truthfully any good
    trader realizes that being wrong is just a part of the game. The amateur is the
    one that takes a high edge situation and manages to mess it up by creating an
    alternative and unconventional game plan that defies the historical and logical
    odds. It makes me chuckle whenever I see people questioning whether “this time
    is different” etc. Let the talking heads make the bizarre and extreme market predictions
    that end up making a select few famous in the media and among institutions. These
    same talking heads will fade away after missing an entire bull market, or calling
    a bottom way too early at some point down the line. Personally, all I care about
    is the most reliable estimate of Expected Value. One does not arrive at that from
    reading arcane tea leaves—an expert arrives at that estimate by ***l******ooking
    at the most reliable and unbiased evidence***. Right now, the play is simple:
    risk an amount you can afford to lose that keeps you in the game—too much leverage
    at this point is not recommended. Look for a good exit, scale out on the way up
    in chunks if you can’t find a decisive exit point. ***Try to use a time stop here—a
    bounce should work within at most 5 days, if it does not you should definitely
    exit and find a better entry point***.'
