- en: The S&P 500 today lost 8.7%. That wasn’t the worst of it. The Nasdaq 100 lost
    about 10.5% and the banking index (BKX) lost 20%. For the S&P 500 there has only
    been 1 day that has been worse – 10/19/87 - the crash of ’87\. On October 26,
    1987 the S&P dropped 8.3%, which was close. Some other memorable drops since then
    would include 10/27/97 (-6.9%), 8/31/98 (-6.8%), and 9/17/01 (-4.9%). This was
    about 2% worse than any of those.

    charts of all the times the Dow lost 8.0% or more in one day.

    In contrast, the crashes of 1929 and 1987 happened as a breakdown from a topping
    pattern.
