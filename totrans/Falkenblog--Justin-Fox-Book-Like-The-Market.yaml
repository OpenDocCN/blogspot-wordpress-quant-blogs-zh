    actually a very even handed portrayal of efficient markets, and portfolio theory.

    But it is classically good nonfiction science in that he draws you in with personal
    vignettes that make you feel like you were there, and outlines many important
    people in the history of financial theory and issues in modern finance. As a finance
    geek that''s near my interest in the way that wanna-be celebrities read People

    his treatment a bit too easy on the other side. Yet, while I have an opinion I
    know it is a minority one, and technical, surely not one for a broad audience.
    The bottom line is that there are several important issues in finance that are
    contentious, and the reader will leave aware of this, which for most readers leaves
    them much the richer. Is the Dick Thaler view more productive than Eugene Fama's?
    Well, they both suggest index funds, so what's the essence of their difference?
    It's not obvious, other than semantics. Is the issue merely, whether one wants
    to call the same thing 'inefficient' or 'efficient', because of the broader implications
    for the invisible hand and thus regulation? Thaler runs

    other thinks it''s an inefficiency. They both think most investors prefer to buy
    this slant, and are mindful of momentum. Thaler notes ''it''s better to be vaguely
    right than precisely wrong'', yet one could say that''s why the market is better
    than fundamental analysis as opposed to vice versa. Figuring out the real essence
    of their difference is outside this book.'

    and Thaler pieces were so contaminated by the low-prices, and have not been updated
    the way that momentum, the opposite of his findings, has. But that gets to my
    point. Getting into detail on what and why one disagrees gets technical very quickly,
    anathema to a book aimed at a broader audience.

    strong point was not creating a case for his client ('irrational/inefficient'
    markets) the way, say, Burton Malkiel advocated for his client ('rational/efficient'
    markets). The most successful 'irrational markets' books are either politically
    motivated, which have a stable but limited appeal usually advocating some liberal
    agenda, or really rich guys who can credibly present their wacky alternative to
    efficient markets based on how frickin' rich they are (Soros, Schiff). I sense
    Fox wants this book to be read in 10 years, and so he merely tries to let both
    sides speak their peace, in the process drawing on his strengths as a writer to
    make you feel like you are right there as the great ideas are being created.
