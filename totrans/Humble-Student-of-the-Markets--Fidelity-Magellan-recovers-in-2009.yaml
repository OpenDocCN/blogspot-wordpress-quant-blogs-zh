- en: Remember Peter Lynch? He skippered Fidelity Magellan (FMAGX) during the 1977-1990
    period and took the obscure fund to fame. The fund beat the S&P 500 in 11 of those
    13 years. Since his departure, FMAGX has gone to a number of managers.

    April 9, or 11% ahead of the S&P 500\. Lange appeared to have achieved these returns
    with a combination of bets on emerging markets, interest rates and good stock
    picking.

- en: When I reverse engineered FMAGX’s macro exposures, the turnaround in performance
    was surprising as portfolio manager Lange was aggressive in his market beta, or
    market timing bet. As the chart below shows, FMAGX moved to an aggressive stance
    on the market in the late summer of 2008 and cranked up that exposure as the market
    tanked.

- en: Morningstar reports that FMAGX had 21% of the fund exposed to foreign stocks.
    Fortunately, it seemed to be the right kind of exposure. FMAGX has had a consistent
    overweight exposure to emerging market stocks. A quick look at the iShares MSCI
    Emerging Markets ETF (EEM) shows that it beat the S&P 500 by 18% YTD. (Note that
    the fund may not have actually held a big position in emerging markets, but held
    stocks that were highly correlated to emerging markets – a subtle difference.)
