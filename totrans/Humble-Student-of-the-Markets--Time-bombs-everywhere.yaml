    consequences. We never absorbed the lessons of the Depression from our grandparents.
    We quickly forgot the sobering malaise of the '70s as the bull market of the '80s
    and '90s gave us the illusion of wealth and an easy future. Even the crash of
    Black Friday seemed a mere bump on the path to success, passing so quickly. And
    as interest rates came down and money became easier, our propensity to acquire
    things took over.

    what seemed like their ever-rising value, to finance consumption today.

    They can either spend and print money like crazy in order to put off the day of
    reckoning, or they can bite the bullet now by defaulting on debt, raising taxes
    or drastically cutting spending. We just don’t know which path they will choose
    or whether the markets will allow them to choose.
