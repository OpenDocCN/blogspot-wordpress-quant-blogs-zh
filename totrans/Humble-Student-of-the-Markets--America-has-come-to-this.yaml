    a very anemic economic recovery. Here are a couple of anecdotal data points that
    show how difficult the recovery has been.

- en: New research from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shows that Americans
    60 and older still owe about $36 billion in student loans, providing a rare window
    into the dynamics of student debt. More than 10 percent of those loans are delinquent.
    As a result, consumer advocates say, it is not uncommon for Social Security checks
    to be garnished or for debt collectors to harass borrowers in their 80s over student
    loans that are decades old.

- en: Whether and how that sanguine trend seeps into the single family home housing
    market remains to be seen, with ‘Shadow” inventory levels and an opaque foreclosure
    pipeline make this a tougher call. Not to mention the difference in demographics
    between the two buyer bases. And while mobile home sales volumes are up, prices
    for manufactured houses are still negative year on year. ***If nothing else, the
    contours of the current recovery in this narrow part of the housing market likely
    inform the likely path of eventual recovery for the industry as a whole.***
