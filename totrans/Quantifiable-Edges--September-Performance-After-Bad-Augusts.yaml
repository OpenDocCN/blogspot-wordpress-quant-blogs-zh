    the market has suffered a difficult August with the SPX closing down about 5.6%.

    evident in all of these Septembers is that there was high volatility. The 1966
    instance saw the smallest range with the market moving a little over 5% from high
    to low. Six of the eight instances saw ranges of 9.5%+ in September. So I would
    not look for the action to dull this month.
