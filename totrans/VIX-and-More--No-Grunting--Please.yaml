    on the [unlikely return of a sub-10 VIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/06/vix-implosion-ahead.html).  Of
    course, the first thing I noticed when the markets opened today was that the VIX
    had fallen another 1.06 points to 12.58, meaning that a single digit VIX was suddenly
    not looking like a fanciful idea.  I haven’t changed my opinion about the VIX
    trading in the 12.50 – 15.00 range, but I must confess to elevating an eyebrow
    for some of the morning’s action.'

    Options Report](http://adamsoptions.blogspot.com/) would be returned, but the
    fleet afoot Adam Warner pounced before you could say “[VIX implosion](http://adamsoptions.blogspot.com/2007/06/single-digit-vix-soon.html)”
    and detailed his thinking about how gravity might swallow the VIX whole during
    the next options cycle.

    strongly suggest this is not a typical 35 day stretch. Summer is slower to begin
    with, and have a holiday smack in the middle of this cycle. On a Wednesday no
    less, which invariably leads to an incredibly dull week.'

    action that the price implies. But you are not getting full time value here, rather
    something les than 35 days worth of fluctuation.

    *event*, there is a ton of dead time coming up. So they can offer cheaper.

    of an option gets cheaper and everything else stays the same (most notably time
    until expiration), it will spit out a lower volatility.

    cycle generally produce lower volatility anyway as buy writes get rolled. Then
    comes the holiday, and not just a long weekend but a week long siesta.

    side relative to actual stock volatility and it just feels VERY vulnerable to
    a VIX crush.”*

    is the better tennis player or more pixel-worthy influence your thinking about
    the VIX, but if teenage boys start flocking to this site to brush up on their
    market timing skills, at least I know that I will have contributed to the betterment
    of humanity in some small way.
