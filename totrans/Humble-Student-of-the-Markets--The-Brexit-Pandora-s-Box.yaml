- en: The Vietnam War was a war that scarred the national psyche and dramatically
    changed the tone of American foreign policy for a generation. If you visit the
    Vietnam Memorial in Washington DC today, you will find roughly 58,000 names of
    fallen soldiers from that period. Now imagine if instead of losing 58,000 soldiers,
    the United States lost 2.5 million during the Vietnam War. For a country like
    the US of roughly 300 million people, that kind of casualty rate would mean that
    virtually every household in America would be touched by combat death, whether
    it's a father, son, brother, uncle, friend or neighbor. Then 25-30 years later,
    which is roughly the span between the Vietnam War and 9/11, the country got involved
    in another conflict with a similar death toll.

    Wars - and the losses quoted would be roughly what the equivalent losses are for
    the US on an equivalent per capita basis on par with many European countries.
