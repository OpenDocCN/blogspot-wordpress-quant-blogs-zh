- en: Over the next 7 days there appears to be a bearish bias. Not seen in the above
    table is that 75% of instances closed below the entry at some point in the next
    3 days, 84% in 5 days and 94% within 9 days. A decent sized pullback tends to
    occur at some point in nearly all instances.
