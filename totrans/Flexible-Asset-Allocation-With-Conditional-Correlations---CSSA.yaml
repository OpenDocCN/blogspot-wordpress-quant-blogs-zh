    from [QuantStrat TradeR](http://quantstrattrader.wordpress.com/2014/10/20/an-attempt-at-replicating-flexible-asset-allocation-faa/).
    Ilya is a talented quant with a passion for testing new ideas. One of the ideas
    relates to a recent [post](http://quantstrattrader.wordpress.com/2014/10/20/an-attempt-at-replicating-flexible-asset-allocation-faa/)
    he wrote on replicating an heuristic method for constructing portfolios called
    “Flexible Asset Allocation”. A while back I was forwarded an interesting article
    by Wouter Keller on “[Flexible Asset Allocation](http://www.researchgate.net/publication/256043230_Generalized_Momentum_and_Flexible_Asset_Allocation_%28FAA%29_An_Heuristic_Approach)”
    (FAA) that gained popularity for its novel approach for blending momentum, correlations
    and volatility into one composite ranking scheme for tactical asset allocation.
    The correlation component of the ranking was apparently inspired by the [Minimum
    Correlation Algorithm](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2012/09/12/minimum-correlation-algorithm-mca/
    "Minimum Correlation Algorithm (MCA)"). The general ranking method is essentially
    a weighted average of the ranking of each asset versus the universe in terms of
    momentum (return over a chosen window, higher is better), volatility (standard
    deviation, lower is better) and correlation. For the correlation component, Mr.
    Keller suggests ranking assets relative to their average correlation to all other
    assets- since that is a good proxy for the diversification potential (lower is
    better). The final result is that FAA manages to demonstrate both good performance
    and also robustness across time. For a good review of FAA, Wes Gray of [Alpha
    Architect](http://www.alphaarchitect.com/) (which is a very good research resource)
    wrote a good post showing the superiority of the approach over simpler methods
    [here](http://www.alphaarchitect.com/blog/2014/09/18/flexible-asset-allocation-dethroning-moving-average-rules/#.VE3lv_nF_O4).

  zh: 最近，我与[QuantStrat TradeR](http://quantstrattrader.wordpress.com/2014/10/20/an-attempt-at-replicating-flexible-asset-allocation-faa/)的Ilya
    Kipnis进行了一些研究合作。Ilya是一位充满热情的量化分析师，热衷于测试新的想法。其中一个想法涉及最近他在构建名为“灵活资产配置”的启发式方法的[文章](http://quantstrattrader.wordpress.com/2014/10/20/an-attempt-at-replicating-flexible-asset-allocation-faa/)。不久前，我收到了Wouter
    Keller关于“[灵活资产配置](http://www.researchgate.net/publication/256043230_Generalized_Momentum_and_Flexible_Asset_Allocation_%28FAA%29_An_Heuristic_Approach)”（FAA）的一篇有趣的文章，该方法因其将动量、相关性和波动性融合到一个综合排名方案中的新颖方法而受到欢迎。排名的相关性部分显然受到了[最小相关性算法](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2012/09/12/minimum-correlation-algorithm-mca/
    "最小相关性算法（MCA）")的启发。一般的排名方法实质上是在动量（在选定窗口内的回报率，越高越好）、波动性（标准差，越低越好）和相关性方面，对每个资产与整个市场的排名进行加权平均。对于相关性部分，Keller先生建议将资产相对于其与其他所有资产的平均相关性进行排名，因为这是多样化潜力的一个良好代理（越低越好）。最终结果是，FAA不仅能够展现出良好的表现，而且在不同时间段都具有稳健性。关于FAA的一个很好的评论，[Alpha
    Architect](http://www.alphaarchitect.com/)的Wes Gray（这是一个非常好的研究资源）写了一篇很好的文章，展示了这种方法与更简单方法的优越性[在这里](http://www.alphaarchitect.com/blog/2014/09/18/flexible-asset-allocation-dethroning-moving-average-rules/#.VE3lv_nF_O4)。
- en: 'In an email to the author, I was of course flattered, but suggested as an improvement
    that he use “conditional” correlation rankings since the real diversification
    of adding the “nth” asset was dependent on what was currently selected in the
    portfolio. In other words, you can’t rank everything all at once, it needs to
    be done in the sequence in which you choose assets: for example- holding all other
    factors constant (ie momentum and volatility), if I first select a bond fund (owing
    to its low correlation to other assets) the next lowest correlation or best diversifying
    asset would be a stock index rather than say another bond fund. This conditional
    correlation ranking approach avoids redundancy and leads to superior diversification
    and presumably better risk-adjusted performance than using the original method.
    However, it is important to note that it still does not solve the thorny issue
    of how many assets to choose from the portfolio- ie selecting the “top n” by composite
    rank. Furthermore, the choice of “top n” to hold in the portfolio is compounded
    by the original selection of the asset universe. These are separate problems that
    can be solved by using a more elegant framework, and Mr. Keller has several new
    articles out using variations on standard MPT in a dynamic format. The drawback
    to these approaches (and many other viable alternatives) is that they tend to
    have complex mathematical implementations that are not as simple and intuitive
    as the original FAA.'

  zh: 在给作者的一封邮件中，我当然感到很荣幸，但我建议他改进，使用“条件”相关性排名，因为添加“第n”个资产的真正分散化取决于当前投资组合中选择的内容。换句话说，你不能一次性对所有东西进行排名，它需要按照你选择资产的顺序进行：例如
    - 在保持所有其他因素不变的情况下（即动量和波动性），如果我首先选择债券基金（因为其与其他资产的低相关性），那么下一个最低相关性或最佳分散资产将是股票指数而不是另一个债券基金。这种条件相关性排名方法避免了冗余，导致了更好的分散化，可能比使用原始方法具有更好的风险调整后的表现。然而，重要的是要注意，它仍然没有解决从投资组合中选择多少资产的棘手问题-即按复合排名选择“前n”个。此外，“前n”选择持有投资组合受到了资产范围的原始选择的影响。这些是可以通过使用更优雅的框架解决的独立问题，并且凯勒先生发布了几篇使用标准MPT动态格式变体的新文章。这些方法（和许多其他可行的替代方案）的缺点是它们倾向于有复杂的数学实现，不像原始FAA那样简单直观。
- en: Getting back to the concept of conditional correlations , one should replace
    the correlation component in FAA with a dynamic version of the average asset correlation.
    This means that the average correlation relates only to new assets not already
    included in the portfolio to the current assets included in the portfolio. After
    selecting the first asset, you would rank all remaining assets in terms of their
    correlation to the first asset (lower is better). For example, if I select a bond
    fund first, I would then rank all remaining assets in the universe based on their
    correlation to the bond fund. Once you have two or more assets, you would find
    the average correlation of each remaining asset to the current portfolio assets.
    This average correlation becomes the ranking method for the remaining assets (lower
    is better). So if I have a bond fund and a stock fund in the portfolio, I would
    find the average of the correlation of each asset remaining (not included in the
    portfolio) in the universe to the bond fund and the stock fund. So if for example
    I was doing this calculation for a gold fund, this would be the average of the
    correlation of gold to the stock fund and the correlation of gold to the bond
    fund. This would be calculated for each remaining asset, from which point you
    can rank them accordingly. This process continues recursively until you reach
    the desired target “top n” /number of assets in the portfolio. So if you choose
    say 5 assets from a 15 asset universe, you would have to compute the regular average
    correlation method from the original FAA to select the first asset and then calculate
    this conditional correlation four separate times.

  zh: 回到条件相关性的概念，应该将 FAA 中的相关性组件替换为平均资产相关性的动态版本。这意味着平均相关性仅与尚未包含在投资组合中的新资产相关联到目前包含在投资组合中的资产。在选择第一个资产后，您将根据它们与第一个资产的相关性对所有剩余资产进行排名（相关性越低越好）。例如，如果我首先选择债券基金，然后我会根据它们与债券基金的相关性对宇宙中所有剩余资产进行排名。一旦您拥有两个或更多资产，您将找到每个剩余资产与当前投资组合资产的平均相关性。这种平均相关性成为剩余资产的排名方法（相关性越低越好）。所以，如果我在投资组合中有债券基金和股票基金，我将找到每个未包含在投资组合中的资产（在宇宙中）与债券基金和股票基金的相关性的平均值。所以如果例如我正在为黄金基金做这个计算，这将是黄金与股票基金的相关性和黄金与债券基金的相关性的平均值。对于每个剩余资产，计算完毕后即可相应排名。这个过程递归地继续，直到达到期望的目标“前
    n”/投资组合中的资产数量。所以如果您从一个 15 个资产的宇宙中选择 5 个资产，您将需要计算原始 FAA 中的常规平均相关性方法来选择第一个资产，然后单独计算此条件相关性四次。
- en: I know this sounds confusing, so Ilya at QuantStrat Trader plans to post a spreadsheet
    soon showing how this is calculated and also associated R Code for the full implementation.
    Presumably, this approach will be more robust when applied to a wider range of
    universes and also will be less sensitive to the choice of “top n”. This new version
    of FAA is still fairly simple, it just requires a few more calculations and it
    is much less complex than implementing MPT-type optimization. There are several
    adjustments that can be made to this new version of FAA that would make it robust
    to the issues mentioned above. Its just always a question of how deep one is willing
    to go down the rabbit hole- for hands-on practitioners, this modified version
    of FAA will probably be practical enough with some common sense calibration. For
    quants (and ultimately for the end investor), it is more beneficial to consider
    a more nuanced/sophisticated approach- and probably a different framework altogether.
    In reality, there are many dimensions to creating investor portfolios that require
    not only precise consideration of how to blend different elements (such as momentum,
    correlation, and volatility) but more importantly there needs to be a method for
    dealing with constraints and matching investor risk preferences. Of course, this
    brings back the necessity for a framework that computes a set of portfolio weights.
    There are some very interesting solutions to this problem that I will present
    at some point in the future.

  zh: 我知道这听起来很混乱，所以QuantStrat Trader的Ilya计划很快发布一个电子表格，展示这是如何计算的，以及完整实现的相关R代码。据推测，这种方法应用于更广泛的领域时会更加稳健，对于“top
    n”的选择也会更不敏感。这个FAA的新版本仍然相当简单，只是需要进行更多的计算，比起实施MPT类型的优化要简单得多。对于这个新版本的FAA，可以进行几个调整，使之对上述问题更具鲁棒性。对于实际操作者来说，这个修改过的FAA版本可能会很实用，只需要一些常识性的校准。对于量化分析师（最终对于最终投资者），考虑更加细致/复杂的方法可能更有益—而且可能完全是一个不同的框架。实际上，创建投资组合有许多方面需要考虑，不仅需要准确地考虑如何混合不同的元素（如动量、相关性和波动性），更重要的是需要一种处理约束和匹配投资者风险偏好的方法。当然，这就需要计算一组投资组合权重的框架。对于这个问题有一些非常有趣的解决方案，我将在未来的某个时候提出。
