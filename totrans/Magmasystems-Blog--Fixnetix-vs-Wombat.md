# Magmasystems Blog: Fixnetix vs Wombat

> 来源：[http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2008/02/fixnetix-vs-wombat.html#0001-01-01](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2008/02/fixnetix-vs-wombat.html#0001-01-01)

I have heard of some companies starting to look at

[Fixnetix](http://www.fixnetix.com/data-feeds.html)

as a possible replacement and/or alternative to Wombat for low-latency market data feeds.

Has anyone done a bakeoff between the two? How about

[Activ](http://www.activfinancial.com/)

?

Wombat is starting to promote its stack that include Coral8 for CEP/latency monitoring and OneTick for a tick database. Reuters has the same with Streambase and Vhayu. This means that Fixnetix and Activ will probably be looking towards that direction as well. Can an alliance with Aleri be in the cards for any of these vendors?
