    of Acadian Asset Management in Boston and Jeffrey Wurgler of New York University's
    Stern School of Business. The trio studied returns for the entire stock market
    and the 1,000 largest stocks from 1968 to 2008.

    and with the portfolio refreshed monthly, would have shrunk 5.5% annually to less
    than $1,000 after inflation over the 41 years studied. The same amount invested
    in the least risky 20% would have grown to an inflation-adjusted $100,000, representing
    an annualized 5.8% return, or 1.6 percentage points above the S&P 500.'

    could not use in any way. I remember spending several hours--at $500 an hour--going
    over this concept with my befuddled IP lawyer. Alas, it was rather pointless,
    because my ex-employer's demand I not use low volatility in any way morphed into
    'low volatility in a way to be determined after of discovery', which was the same
    thing in practice, because it basically made everything I did potentially suspect.
    The whole point of constructing a rational defense against a party with bad faith
    is futile.
