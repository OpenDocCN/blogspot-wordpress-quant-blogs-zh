- en: About a year ago I showed a table on the blog that broke down op-ex week by
    month. Op-ex week in general is normally pretty bullish. March, April, and December
    it has been especially so. S&P 500 options began trading in mid-1983\. The table
    below is an updated version of the one I produced last year. It goes back to 1984\.
    I excluded op-ex week of September 2001 due to the extreme (and horrific) circumstances.

    March op-ex.
