- en: As a five stock portfolio that has sector concentration rules built in but no
    country or regional rules, there are occasional instances in which Portfolio A1
    inadvertently takes multiple positions in a concentrated geographical area.  This
    week is one of those instances, as the portfolio is selling fertilizer producer
    [Terra Industries (TRA)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=tra) after the company
    triggered an automatic sell rule by dropping 20% from the high during its holding
    period.

- en: In lieu of TRA, the portfolio is adding Brazilian pulp and paper producer [Votorantim
    Celulose e Papel SA (VCP)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=vcp), an ADR which
    I will henceforth conveniently refer to by their ticker.  In [Brazil Rallies While
    China Struggles](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/02/brazil-rallies-while-china-struggles.html),
    I recently noted how the Brazilian ETF ([EWZ](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=ewz))
    had reflected the country’s recent superior performance relative to the more widely
    discussed China ETF ([FXI](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=fxi)); for those
    looking for individual Brazilian equities, you may wish to add VCP to you watch
    list, as it looks like it may have pulled back to technical support.  VCP joins
    Brazilian telecom standout [Tele Norte Leste Participacoes SA (TNE)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=tne);
    together these two companies will now comprise approximately 42% of the portfolio.

    of 16% over the benchmark S&P 500 index, with a 4.5% cumulative gain vs. an 11.5%
    cumulative loss for the SPX.
