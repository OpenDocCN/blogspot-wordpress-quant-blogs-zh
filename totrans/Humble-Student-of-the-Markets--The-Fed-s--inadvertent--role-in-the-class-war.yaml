- en: 'The question for the contemporary reader is this: If we could transport a modern-day
    economist back to 1937, would he or she have made the same mistake? My suggested
    answer—admittedly somewhat hopeful—is no. I base this view on the fact that most
    economists today distinguish between the temporary movements in the consumer price
    index that stem from volatility in commodity prices and the movements that reflect
    fundamental inflation pressures. Hence a modern economist most likely would have
    identified the price rise in 1936 and 1937 as a temporary upswing in commodity
    prices that did not signal a significant increase in overall inflation.'

    and asset inflation as transitory and the Fed should not react with a tighter
    monetary policy.

    not represent the views of the New York Fed, it is clear to me that the sanguine
    attitude towards commodity and asset inflation is dominant at the Bernanke Fed.

    mainly measured as core CPI, or some inflation measure ex-food and energy, i.e.
    commodity prices. The central bankers of the developed world today learned in
    the 1970's the way to break the back of inflationary expectations is watch labor
    costs carefully. If you don't allow labor costs to rise, then you suppress the feedback
    loop that leads to ever rising inflationary expectations. (Meanwhile outside of
    the West, things are different. Consider this

    creates different winners and losers. When the Fed turns a blind eye to asset
    inflation and but remains vigilant on wage inflation, it tilts the playing field
    in favor of the owners of capital and away from the suppliers of labor.
