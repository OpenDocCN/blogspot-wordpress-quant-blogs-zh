# Magmasystems Blog: Wall Street meets Hollywood

From the New York Times article

[here](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/14/business/media/14studio.html?ei=5087%0A&em=&en=1a7ef46c6e125d6f&ex=1161057600&adxnnl=1&adxnnlx=1160929226-Bfde0TEwgLW1RNfZ8DSl0g)

.

Hedge funds and Wall Street investment banks are plowing money into Hollywood films, paying producers like Joel Silver and Ivan Reitman to produce hits.

I guess that we have to write a market data source that monitors the turnstiles of each of the movies that we invest in. Craig, can you come up with a feed handler in a week?

(I wonder how we will hedge this .... Long Ivan Reitman and short Delta House?)
