# Humble Student of the Markets: The market's upper BB roller coaster ride

**Mid-week market update**: The S&P 500 has been riding its upper Bollinger Band. Historically, upper BB rides haven't been all that bearish, but the current episode is occurring against a backdrop of negative RSI divergences.

While the S&P 500 may be on an upper BB ride, it promises to be a roller coaster.
