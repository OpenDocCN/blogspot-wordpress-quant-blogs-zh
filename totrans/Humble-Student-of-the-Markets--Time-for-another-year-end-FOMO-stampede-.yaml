    as enthusiasm about the Trump tax cuts gripped investor psychology. The market
    corrected in early 2018 and rose steadily into October, though the advance could
    not be characterized as a melt-up. In late 2019, the market staged a similar FOMO
    stampede and the rally was halted by the news of the pandemic spreading around
    the world.

    a pattern of an initial high, a retreat, followed by a higher high either coincident
    or ahead of the ultimate stock market peak.
