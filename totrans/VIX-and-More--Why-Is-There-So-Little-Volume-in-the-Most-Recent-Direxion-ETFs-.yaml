    firepower of the [Direxion](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Direxion)
    [triple ETFs](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/triple%20ETFs). Oddly,
    only the [first batch](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/11/prediction-direxion-triple-etfs-will.html)
    of ETFs that were rolled out in November have caught fire. These include the familiar
    tickers like [FAS](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/FAS), [FAZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/FAZ),
    [TNA](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TNA), [TZA](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TZA),
    [BGU](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/BGU), [BGZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/BGZ),

- en: The most recent group of ETFs, which I discussed in [Direxion Triple ETFs Add
    New Horses to Stable](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/01/direxion-triple-etfs-add-new-horses-to.html),
    has attracted considerably less interest. Even though they were launched at the
    end of December, only two of the six ETFs, [EDC](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EDC)
    and [TYH](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TYH), have surpassed the
    100,000 single day volume mark and TYH just grazed that bar, with a high volume
    mark of 101,900\. In the chart below, a snapshot taken just past the halfway point
    of today’s session, the six new ETFs can be seen floundering at the bottom.

    and technology (TYH and [TYP](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TYP))
    are consistently among the most volatile corners of the market.

    up with today.
