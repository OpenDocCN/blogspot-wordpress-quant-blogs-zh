    list, then you are missing out on what I consider to be perhaps the most deftly
    written and intelligently reasoned investment blog out there. To top it off, the
    topics are timely, there is a liberal sprinkling of wry humor, and if you have
    a dictionary handy, you can usually increase your vocabulary too.

    to Give You a Pony](http://www.condoroptions.com/index.php/market-commentary/technical-analysis-fails-to-give-you-a-pony/)
    and see for yourself. In what may be my favorite post of the year so far, Condor
    Options, provides a sharp counterpoint to Michael Tsang and Eric Martin, whose
    [Stock Charts Fail Forecast Test in Complete S&P Miss](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=aM76hi1IDeOo&refer=home)
    argues that technical analysis strategies failed investors from the October 2007
    peak to the March 2009 decline. The Condor critique includes a discussion of indicator
    selection and time frame selection. It also notes that each of eight indicators
    did beat S&P 500 during evaluation period.

    thought that I have been ruminating about for the last few months: what lessons
    should we take away from the 2007-09 bear market?'

    subject and I have no intention of taking more than a first pass at it this time
    around, but since I haven’t seen it discussed at any length elsewhere, today seems
    like a good day to dive in.

    last year or so. While this may sound heretical at first blush, it is certainly
    possible that the confluence of events that put the financial system and the markets
    in peril over the course of the last year will not be repeated during the course
    of my trading lifetime and perhaps yours as well. This may be a little naïve,
    but consider that it was 21 years between VIX spikes over 80 and more than 70
    years since we have seen a bear market as aggressive as the recent one.

    to an N-year flood. In preparing for an N-year flood, it may be desirable to build
    a dam and levee system that is capable of containing an N-year flood. On the other
    hand, it may make more sense to construct a system that is designed to withstand
    only a fraction of an N-year flood and to focus more resources on an optimal evacuation
    plan and communication system.

    20 and 30 foot winter swells and might consider hopping on a 50 footer at [Maverick’s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mavericks_%28location%29)
    if he or she thought it might win the competition. At some point, however, the
    waves become too big and dangerous to try to ride. At some point, we are all better
    off being spectators.

    reverts to all cash when certain events hit a global exit trigger. These might
    includes triggers such as a 20% peak to trough drawdown in the SPX, a close of
    greater than 50 in the VIX, the loss of 25% or more in one’s account equity, etc.

    but I think the first thing most investors should consider is that they only need
    to play the game when the odds are in their favor.
