    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    the economy sufficiently for the Fed to cut rates, and then call off the trade
    war so that the stock market could soar ahead of the 2020 election?

    and other matters. We do not know how or when these issues will be resolved. We
    are closely monitoring the implications of these developments for the U.S. economic
    outlook and, as always, we will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with
    a strong labor market and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent objective. My
    comments today, like this conference, will focus on longer-run issues that will
    remain even as the issues of the moment evolve.

    with the first one at the July FOMC meeting. This matters to equity investors.
    A historical study from Barclays showed that the stock market tends to have a
    strong positive reaction a month after the first rate cut, and returns were even
    stronger after six months.
