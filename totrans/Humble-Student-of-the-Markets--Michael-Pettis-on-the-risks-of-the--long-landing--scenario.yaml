    consisted of liberalizing reforms that undermined the Communist elite and which
    were strongly opposed by them. Because power was highly centralized under Deng
    Xiaoping, however, including a loyal PLA, he and the reform faction were nonetheless
    able to force through the reforms.

    relationship to the interests of the Chinese elite. Because they involved the
    accumulation and distribution of resources to favored groups whose role was to
    achieve specific economic targets, they helped to reinforce the wealth and power
    of a new elite, many of whose members were, or were related to, the old elite.
    Not surprisingly this new elite strongly supported the growth model imposed by
    Beijing during these stages.

    the benefits of growth are distributed in ways that are not only unfair but must
    create imbalances. Because low-risk investments return roughly 20% on average
    in a country with 20% nominal GDP growth, financial repression means that the
    benefits of growth are unfairly distributed between savers (who get just the deposit
    rate, say 3%), banks, who get the spread between the lending and the deposit rate
    (say 3.5%) and the borrower, who gets everything else (13.5% in this case, assuming
    he takes little risk – even more if he takes risk).

    The IMF calculated a transfer amount equal to 4% of GDP, but said it might be

    only a guess), is that China can continue the current pace of credit growth for
    another 3-4 years at most, after which it cannot grow credit fast enough both
    to roll over what Hyman Minsky suggested was likely to be exponential growth in
    unrecognized bad debt (and WMP and other shadow banking assets will almost certainly
    be absorbed into the formal banks), and to provide enough new lending to fund
    further economic activity. If there is less time, as I think Anne Stevenson might
    argue, or if Beijing cannot get credit and rebalancing under control before then,

    complete. Remember that declining home prices have a negative wealth effect on
    those who are long real estate, especially speculatively long, and the impact
    is likely to be immediate, but as these people are likely to be relatively wealthy,
    the impact on consumption might be limited. For Chinese who are effectively "short"
    real estate (young people, poor people, renters, migrant workers), declining home
    prices will have a positive wealth effect which, because they are poor, may affect
    consumption more, but may take longer because declining prices might not be immediately
    as credible to non-owners as to owners. I wouldn't suggest that the wealth effect
    impact of a real estate slump could be positive, but it might not be as negative
    as it was in Japan or the US.

    I think, because she identifies and untangles chains of risk rather than build
    the data-intensive and largely misapplied math models that much of the sell-side
    prefers, I think the jury is still out. On the whole I still think the long-landing
    scenario is more likely than a collapse because Beijing does have levers and a
    stable, if inefficient, banking system, but my 3-4% number is for me a likely
    upper limit, not the expected growth rate. At any rate we shouldn't doubt that
    rebalancing is always the hard part, and because it was too long postponed, any
    distribution of predictions should come with very fat left-side tails.
