    a new performance statistics report for backtest results. In deciding what I would
    be using, I used reader feedback and I went on other blogs I follow to see what
    they were using. This way I think readers will be able to easily compare the different
    ideas they see across the blogosphere. As a guideline, I will from now on be using
    a statistical output relatively similar to the output produced by the [DVixl platform](http://dvindicators.cssanalytics.com/product/dvix/)
    (highly recommended product). In addition, I am going to be inserting three other
    measures in the tables. They are described below.

    in my opinion an improved version of the popular Sharpe ratio. The Sharpe ratio
    is computed using the mean return divided by the standard deviation of returns.
    While its simplicity is appealing, it isn’t a flawless measure (none is); it penalize
    both upside and downside volatility. From an intuitive point of view, only penalizing
    downside volatility make more sense, because upside volatility is desirable for
    investors. This is exactly what the Sortino ratio does (from wiki):'

    rate of return for the investment strategy under consideration, (T was originally
    known as the minimum acceptable return or MAR); DR is the downside risk. Note
    that for the statistic on the blog, the MAR is going to be 0, same as in the Sharpe
    calculation.

    by David Varadi. The value reported will be the ex-post (after the fact) value
    of the 5th percentile on the negative returns empirical distribution. It indicates
    that historically, we had daily returns worse that the value 5% of the time. Note
    that this is a non-parametric VaR which I prefer to the version assuming Gaussian
    distribution.

    a broader audience of reader, and I also think that it will improve the value
    of the blog. In a short period of time, I will be posting strategies that I consider
    more tradable than the concepts I have talked about before and I think that the
    new format will be better to convey their value.
