## What’s wrong with Microsoft’s RIA Architecture Pocket Guide?

Push! I’ve blogged about this before, but it appears Microsoft still doesn’t get the concept of “Push” in [RIA](http://blogs.msdn.com/jmeier/archive/2008/11/24/ria-architecture-pocket-guide.aspx) land. Microsoft has produced 145 pages of RIA Architecture guidance, and yet missed one of the primary reasons you’d use a Silverlight RIA. Silverlight gives you zero-touch deployment. Why would I want to force my clients to open a firewall [port](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2009.01.entslpt1.aspx) just to get push data when I could just as easily go with [Liberator](http://www.freeliberator.com/) and [Kaazing](http://www.kaazing.com/).
