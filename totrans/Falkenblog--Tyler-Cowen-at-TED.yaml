    dislikes games, such as Trivial Pursuit, in comparison to reading. Anyway, I found

- en: 'at TEDxMidAtlantic rather fascinating, because he basically argues that fiction
    is, ultimately, fiction. He argues against trying to fit everything into a ''story''.
    That is, there is a small set of story lines: journey, rags to riches, quest,
    voyage and return, comedy, tragedy, rebirth, facing mortality, etc. So, we have
    the story of Moses, and helps us understand George Washington, Abraham Lincoln,
    and Martin Luther King, emancipating a people. Stories are the way most people
    make sense about everyday happenings. They are theory that we apply to events,
    the why that explains the what.'

    debate, our career trajectory, our lives. Tyler notes that this may be too much.
    Life isn''t a story. Often it just keeps going, is messy, and has no point.'

    and his first draft was basically a narrative with stuff happening but no arc,
    no Exposition/Rising Action/Climax/Falling Action/Denouement: he went there, and
    Clay said X and so we did this and Connor said Y and yada yada yda. I tried to
    get him to appreciate the essence of a story, but it was suprisingly (for me!)
    not obvious to him, and his intuition was based on his experience with life, which
    is, there is no story.'

    and his 10-year old intuition is unstructured, incomplete. Yet his innocence betrays
    some naive wisdom, that life is in some sense ''one damned thing after another''.
    It''s good to know the strengths and limitations of both views: without facts,
    everything is bullshit; without theory, everything is trivia.'

    that unlike the Coelacanth or starfish our finite lives have some transcendence,
    which in our secular age means some small yet permanent benefit to justice and
    equality (synonymous for many). Instead, I think today's giants are all like great
    harpists of the past. They may have been fortunate to play an instrument well,
    but no matter how good, their skill is now an anachronism, and not valued in itself.
    Over time, it will be totally unappreciated, as future generations prefer different
    melodies and instruments. To think every drama in our lives is part of a story,
    written by fate, is alluring, but fanciful.

    I want to be better than my parents, my old bosses. I get satisfaction when I
    do things well in this regard. If it all disintegrates because I was a fool, or
    the sun blows up and disintegrates the Earth in 1 billion years, I don't care.
