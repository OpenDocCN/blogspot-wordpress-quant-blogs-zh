- en: It took 25 trading sessions for the VIX to shed half of the excess baggage it
    had accumulated by the August 16 intra-day high of 37.50\. Thanks to the Fed’s
    larger than expected rate cut, not only is the VIX looking like a competitor from
    [The Biggest Loser](http://www.nbc.com/The_Biggest_Loser/), but Friday also marked
    the first day since July that the VIX spend the entire day in the teens.

- en: The VIX dropped 5.92 points or 23.8% this week to end the week at 19.00, but
    consistent with the volatility roller coaster theme, this was only the third largest
    weekly drop of 2007.  The drop was enough to turn the VWSI around, however, pushing
    that indicator from -1 to +6.  The VWSI has only registered an end of week reading
    of +6 or higher five times since 1998, with four of those five instances seeing
    a significantly higher VIX over the next few weeks.

    climate and consider also that at its present level, the VIX sits a mere 0.07
    above its 17+ year lifetime mean.  To my thinking at least, the VIX is once again
    looking like fairly cheap portfolio insurance…

- en: In the New World, semillon has gained a strong foothold in <country-region st="on"><place
    st="on">Australia</place></country-region>, where it is frequently blended with
    chardonnay and sauvignon blanc, but also sold on its own.  Last I checked, [Peter
    Lehmann Wines](http://www.peterlehmannwines.com/ProductOverview.aspx?p=17) produces
    four different semillons, with the <placename st="on">Barossa</placename> <placetype
    st="on">Valley</placetype> one of the most widely distributed in the <country-region
    st="on"><place st="on">US</place></country-region>.  Skipping a little to the
    east, just this evening I had an excellent [2002 Alpha Domus semillon](http://www.wineoftheweek.com/archives/wine040222.html)
    from New Zealand, but the Kiwis have yet to show the same enthusiasm for semillon
    that they have for sauvignon blanc.  Still, the Alpha Domus effort proves that
    the potential is there.

    semillon, but one to keep an eye on is [L'Ecole Nº 41](http://www.lecole.com/wines_semillon.php),
    from the <place st="on"><city st="on">Walla Walla</city>, <state st="on">Washington</state></place>
