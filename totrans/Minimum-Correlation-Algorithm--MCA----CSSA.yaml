- en: 'Stay tuned for the release of our forthcoming whitepaper: “The Minimum Correlation
    Algorithm (MCA): A Practical and Effective Diversification Tool.”  The paper will
    contain an overview of the algorithm logic as well as a comparison of the  performance
    and diversification score  of MCA versus Risk Parity, Maximum Diversification,
    and Minimum Variance. This heuristic algorithm is fast and relatively simple to
    calculate and can be applied effectively to both asset allocation and also to
    trading strategies. The complete “R” code for replication will be released in
    the paper. The scheduled release date is next Thursday.'
