- en: Trump's two personas are on a collision course with each other. On one hand,
    he likes to style himself as Tariff Man, because he believes the US has had a
    raw deal from its trading partners. The list of offenders starts with China, but
    it is numerous. Tariffs are the best tool to address that imbalance. On the other
    hand, Trump the Dow Man loves a booming stock market, which he tracks obsessively,
    and views it as a form of validation of the success of his administration.
  prefs: []

- en: As trade jitters rose, the stock market has become nervous and sold off. Markets
    hate trade wars, and they hate uncertainty. While Tariff Man and Dow Man can coexist
    when trade tensions are low, we will reach some tipping point where Trump has
    to choose.

    input into a view on the strategy, you would also need to know how the trade war
