- en: Word has it that the developers at Barcap are jumping for joy at their bonuses
    this year. After several years of sub-par bonuses, and difficulty last year in
    bringing new developers on, Barcap finally saw the light and rewarded their hard-working
    devs with a decent chunk of change.

    community, and that word of good and bad bonuses spread like wildfire. In order
    to retain good talent and hire new talent from other companies, a firm has to
    have a good reputation with regards to bonuses in the IT department. It doesn't
    matter if your traders and sakesmen are getting 300% bonuses ... it's the IT department
    that has to write and maintain the systems that drive trading operations.

- en: Consider the cost of losing the only person on a team who knows the code of
    a complex system. Think of the time you have to spend hiring a replacement (taking
    time from employees to do the interviews, headhunter fees, sign-on bonus, etc),
    doing the knowledge transfer, and waiting for the perosn to get acclamated to
    the system. How much does a company spend when it loses an experienced hire and
    tries to bring on a new one? Would that amount of money, if applied to a bonus,
    suffice to retain a talented individual?

    the business that IT really matters.
