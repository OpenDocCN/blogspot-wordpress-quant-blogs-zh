- en: I will be in London all next week, checking out the happenings in Canary Wharf.
    I have not been to London for a long time, so it will be interesting to see how
    built up the Wharf is. More interesting will be to see if they built any quality
    pubs. Last time I was in London, all of the pubs closed at 11 at night.
