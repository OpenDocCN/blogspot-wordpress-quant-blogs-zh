- en: The S&P 500 hit an air pocket last week as it was rattled by the rout in bond
    prices. As the index weakened, SPY formed a textbook island reversal with a measured
    objective of about 435, which represents a fairly shallow pullback. However, the
    VIX spiked above its upper Bollinger Band, which is an oversold condition that
    could be indicative of a short-term bottom.
