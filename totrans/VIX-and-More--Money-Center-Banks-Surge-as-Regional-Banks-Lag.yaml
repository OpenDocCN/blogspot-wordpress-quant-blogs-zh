- en: While the S&P 500 index is down about 0.8% as I type this, banks are faring
    considerably better than the index today, continuing a recent trend. Buying interest
    across the bank universe is splintered, however, with strong demand for money
    center banks and less interest in regional banks.

- en: The chart below compares the performance of two popular banking ETFs, [KBE](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/KBE),
    which is based on a broad-based bank index, and [KRE](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/KRE),
    which is based on a regional banking index. The contrast is stark. Not only is
    KBE up 2.2% today while KRE is down a fractional amount, but this has been a recurring
    theme since the end of April, when regional banks became a laggard. Note that
    both banking ETFs have trailed the performance of the full financial sector, as
    represented by seemingly ubiquitous [XLF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLF).

    estate](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/real%20estate) or financials.
    Until this pattern reverses, stocks are not going to be able to correct.
