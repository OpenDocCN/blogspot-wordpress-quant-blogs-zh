- en: Even though I was the very first developer on the Microsoft SQL Server Team,
    I have to admit that databases don't thrill me .... You have to have a special
    mindset to deal with databases all day, and to tell you the truth, my interests
    lie elsewhere. In fact, the sure way to get me to fail an interview is to ask
    me to write any moderately-complicated SQL query.

- en: I firmly believe that, for major systems, the developers should not be allowed
    to design the data model, set up the databases, nor write the DDL. I have seen
    a number of instances in the past where systems that have had their database components
    designed by non-database experts have performed very poorly. Slow queries, no
    indexes, lock contention, etc. The best projects that I have been involved in
    have had a separate person just devoted to the database. If I am leading a major
    project, I will always have a dedicated db expert as part of the effort.
