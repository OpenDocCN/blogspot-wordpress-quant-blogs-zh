    on some third party content for today’s post.  Specifically, I want to introduce
    some ideas from [MarketSci.com](http://www.marketsci.com/index.html) on how to
    use the VIX to trade the [SPY](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=SPY).  In a
    three part series which I have linked below, MarketSci lays out three systems
    which use the VIX to time SPY trades.  These include a long-term system using
    a 186 day VIX SMA which Barron’s [cited in December 2006](http://online.barrons.com/public/article/SB116657195390055016-yAaWYgiFFvWSuzFv_JGVSMmDNGc_20071221.html?mod=9_0002_b_online_exclusives_weekday_r1)
    as being developed by Credit-Suisse; an 11 day EMA-SMA VIX crossover system; and
    an 11 day EMA-SMA system which utilizes both the VIX and the SPY as triggers:'

    plays that I blog about on a regular basis in this space.  Of course, unlike the
    VIX, trading the [SPY](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=SPY) has the benefit
    of being able to go long or short the ETF, use 2x leverage long with the [SSO](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=SSO)
    or short with the [SDS](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=SDS), and use [options](http://finance.yahoo.com/q/os?s=SPY&m=2007-07-20)
    on the underlying.

    as I have increasingly become convinced of its applicability in this area, expect
    to hear more from me on this in the future.
