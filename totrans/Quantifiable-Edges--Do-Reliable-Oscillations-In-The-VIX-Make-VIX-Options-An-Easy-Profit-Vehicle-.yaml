- en: I’ve seen some articles in the press over the last few months suggesting that
    one way to profit in volatile markets is by trading VIX options. They typically
    make it sound easy. “You don’t even need to know the direction of the market.
    You just need to determine whether volatility is likely to rise or fall. If you
    think volatility is going higher, you can buy VIX call options. If you think its
    going lower you can buy VIX put options.” The problem with this logic is that
    VIX option prices do not follow the VIX index. They follow VIX futures prices.
    A couple of months ago I decided to quantify how much this really matters.

    Therefore, when people consider trading the VIX, they many times think mean-reverting
    strategies will work best. I took some simple mean-reverting strategies and applied
    them to the index to see what kind of returns I would get. Two examples were:
    1) Short the VIX if it closes 15% or more above its 10-day moving average. Cover
    when it closes below its 10-day moving average. 2) Short the VIX if it closes
    at a 10-day high. Cover when it closes below its 10-day moving average. In both
    cases the opposite stretch would apply for purchases. Not surprisingly, they worked.
    What was intriguing was HOW WELL they worked. I then combined these strategies
    with a few others to create an indicator which would signal to me when the VIX
    was stretched and due for a reversal.'

    whenever you bought/shorted it, over the last 3 years my simple system would have
    returned about 170% per year based on raw returns (no commissions or slippage).

    all the historical data from CBOE and ran the trades through using front month
    options. I performed rollovers those times when the future expired before the
    trade closed. Note that the entry and exit triggers were based on the action in
    the VIX – not in the futures. The purpose of the study was to see whether someone
    could trade futures/options based on the action in the VIX index. The results?
    Instead of returning 170%/yr over the last 3 years, the system now returned 5%
    total!! Factor in some commissions and slippage and my incredible system is now
    a money-loser.
