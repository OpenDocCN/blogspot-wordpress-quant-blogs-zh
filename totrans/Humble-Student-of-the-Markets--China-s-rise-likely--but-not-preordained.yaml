    that China has seen turbo-charged growth rates which far exceeded growth seen
    in the West and developed economies and these writers believed that Chinese growth
    rates will continue to grow at levels exceeding the developed markets. Others
    objected to the implication that my thesis suggested that somehow that America
    and the developed markets were "robbing" China of growth potential.

    a zero-sum game of American vs. Chinese growth. China's growth path is independent
    from America's and one country does not necessarily grow at the expense of the
    other. The growth path of any country or economy as large as China depends mainly
    on its own policies, rather than the action of others.

    the Great Depression of the 1930s, Argentina was among the 10 richest economies

    from an export and infrastructure based growth model to a consumer led growth
    model, while recognizing the significant tail-risk posed by non-productive infrastructure
    investment fueled by excessive credit growth. These problems are not insurmountable.
    I believe that, in the long term, China would be better off by implementing harsher
    reform policies of market adjustments now even at the price of a hard or crash
    landing, than to try to kick the metaphorical can down the road as it seems to
    be doing now. Such an adjustment would enable the Chinese economy to transition
    to a more sustainable growth path based on quality, not quantity.

    labor means that China cannot sustain rapid export growth based on low-cost labor.
    The economy need to transition to higher value-added activities, which translate
    to better paying jobs compared to just lots of low-paying jobs under the old growth
    model.

    and experience a recession, which is not in anyone's spreadsheet, it doesn't necessarily
    mean that China growth will come to an abrupt stop.
