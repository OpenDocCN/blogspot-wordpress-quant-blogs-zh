    last week or two.  The ICSC varied between +1.5% and +4.5% YoY in 2012\.  This
    week was again close to the bottom end of that range for the ICSC. The JR report
    could just be a one week anomaly, we'll see.  Even in the worst case, it still
    looks like consumer spending has not collapsed due to the  tax withholding increase.
     It's worth noting that WalMart is not included in either ICSC or Johnson Redbook.
