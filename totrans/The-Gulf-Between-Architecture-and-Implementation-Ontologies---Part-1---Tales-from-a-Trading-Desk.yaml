    an interesting read on page 68 on the topic of specifying quality attributes in
    a common form.  In many ways this sounds like an opportunity for BDD, or at least
    the way to describe the architecture behaviour in Cucumber format to avoid the
    dreaded parse-translate issues that normally happens with requirements documents.

- en: Interoperability, Modifiability and Performance (Chapters 6-8) offer good reading. 
    Chapter 9, Security, is often overlooked, or thought about to late in the architecture. 
    Security requirements will often influence the architecture of an application
    in ways not anticipated at the start of a project.  One thing that is missing
    from “Further Reading”, page 157, is the Oracle Security Coding standards, given
    that a large majority of code these days in financial corporations is written
    in Java.  Further, I would also say Data Model security should also take account
    of any legal implications of where the data is allowed to be located.

- en: Testability, chapter 10, states that for a well engineered system, “30-50% (or
    in some cases more)” of the cost goes into testing – page 374 offer a view of
    30-90% of the development budget. Thankfully, page 16 offers details of NetiFlix’s
    monkeys.  However, chapter 10 doesn’t offer a view on leveraging the behaviour
    of the application as a source of truth for testing – BDD again.  Opportunity
    lost.  Page 170 does however offer some good insight into test data – which is
    often overlooked due to the complexity/pain of getting test data.  Page 171 also
    calls out automated testing – large systems can’t/shouldn’t be tested manually.

- en: Moving from Architecture to implementation is always interesting (page 363). 
    How do you validate that the implementation is what was architected?  Frameworks
    and code templates are obvious contenders.  UML is the de facto architecture description
    language, but as discussed on page 369, there is still a gap between architecture
    and implementation.

- en: Again, 19.2 (page 370) missed the opportunity to discuss BDD.  Further, if the
    architected application is to deliver a certain set of behaviours, then maybe
    the developers and testers should work from the same set of behaviour to ensure
    the application is tested appropriately.

    My personal view is that architects need to still understand “code” else, we end
    up in world where architects are not respected by the implementation team.
