# Physics Perspective: Shifting view

> 来源：[http://physicsoffinance.blogspot.com/2016/02/shifting-view.html#0001-01-01](http://physicsoffinance.blogspot.com/2016/02/shifting-view.html#0001-01-01)

Hey, I've changed the title of this blog!

Why? Because I'm going to shift its perspective a little. As all of you will know, I've (mostly) stopped blogging here in the past 4-6 months. Reason? Because much of what interests me now has no immediate link to "finance," and so "physics of finance" doesn't seem quite right. I'd like to eliminate this psychological barrier (for myself). 

So, expect more posts, but maybe on different topics.

Cheers

Mark
