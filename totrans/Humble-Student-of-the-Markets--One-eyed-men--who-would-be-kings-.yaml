- en: Despite what the gold-bugs say, gold and commodities have traditionally been
    part of the "risk-on" trade. In a "risk-off" market panic, risk managers and margin
    clerks control the market. They demand that traders and investors liquidate positions
    in order to meet their risk criteria and meet margin calls on all of their positions.
    That's why correlations converge to 1 during these market selloff episodes. One
    sign that I would watch for as a "tell" of a "margin clerk market" might be that
    gold stocks will de-couple from the price of gold. While gold may go up as a safe
    haven during such an episode, gold stocks may sell off because the risk managers
    regard them as stocks first and gold the alternative currency second.

    a safe haven given its recent history of rising during this period of fear. I
    would not be inclined, however, to give the same benefit of doubt to other hard
    asset commodities. If there were to be a market selloff because of the fear of
    a recession or a banking crisis which would plunge the world into a global recession,
    don't you think that global demand for copper, oil and other economically sensitive
    commodities would fall as well?

    and some investors have regarded JPY as a possible safe haven in a crisis. But
    I have observed how the BoJ (cough) "manages" JPY levels and there is too high
    a risk of intervention. JPY levels is overly "managed" in my book to qualify as
    a true safe haven in a crisis.
