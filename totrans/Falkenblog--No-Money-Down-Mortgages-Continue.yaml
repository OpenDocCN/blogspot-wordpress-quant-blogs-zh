    the slim down payment or closing costs, and leave the stupid investors with losses?
    Well, today that game is over, except for the government, which proves that stupidity
    in the private sector actually loses people money, causing them to change their
    ways. For the government, it's just more incentive to double down.

    capital to pay for routine maintenance, and most importantly, if something major
    happens, like if a heater breaks. A renter is someone who does not have the wherewithall
    to handle these large, unanticipated expenses. It is better for everyone if these
    people are renters, because otherwise a bad break leaves the property in poor
    shape, leading to a 'broken windows' problem.

    discover to make it look like they''ve eaten up hated peas or carrots: spread
    them around the plate. Thus, the recent economic debacle is primarily centered
    on housing, especially lower-end housing financed by overeager lenders. The unavoidable
    endgame to this problem is fewer houses, and lower prices for those houses; demand
    was artificially high. But, we wouldn''t want people to adjust, because every
    good Keynesian knows that all misallocations of resources in a complex economy
    can be solved via top down injections o fiat money, or "G"--they have the multipliers
    to prove it!'

    because those renters are attracted to the FHA loan/$8k tax credit. Those kind
    of effects are basically unmeasurable, and what can't be measured is not counted.
    What about the complex dynamics implicated by the finite nature of the $8k tax
    credit? Preventing the pain with a temporary subsidy merely prolongs the amount
    of time spent in the doldrums (eg, 1933-39 was a period of very high unemployment).

    The sad fact is popular policies usually have highly concentrated benefits and
    highly distributed costs, and the politicians act like little children, hoping
    those watching do not notice stuff that's spread around.
