    on [ETFreplay.com](http://etfreplay.com/) triggered so many favorable comments
    about this site and their graphics that it occurred to me I had neglected to mention
    that [Livevol](http://livevol.com/) has added some new volatility skew graphics
    to Livevol Pro.'

    skew in [USO](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/USO), the crude oil
    ETF. With USO at just under 39 as I type this, the Livevol graphic captures the
    IV skew in the April (red line), May (yellow line), July (green line) and October
    (blue line) options. The April front month options have a steep smile, while the
    July options reflect the more classic flatter smile. Note that the May options
    look more like a smirk. I have not discussed volatility [skew](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/skew)
    much to date, but I think it is time the blog dove into the Greeks, volatility
    skew and some more advanced options analytics, so this is definitely on my list
    of things to do going forward.

    of how to interpret them, a good place to start is at the [Livevol blog](http://livevol.blogspot.com/).

    the [Aurora Borealis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora_%28astronomy%29) while
    looking at these skew charts…
