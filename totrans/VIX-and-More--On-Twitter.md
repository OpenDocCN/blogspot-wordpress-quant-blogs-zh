# VIX and More: On Twitter

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/06/on-twitter.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/06/on-twitter.html#0001-01-01)

Sooner or later, I feel I needed to share my thoughts about [Twitter](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Twitter); since I have added some 1,000 or so followers in the past few days, this seems like a good time as any to speak up.

I have probably been using Twitter on and off for close to two years. From the start, I have had a love-hate relationship with the platform, for a variety of reasons. Initially it was largely a case of poor stability and reliability, then as Twitter made it into the mainstream, it seemed as if it was one too many communications channels – both inbound and outbound. As a result, I have a history of using Twitter in periodic bursts of activity, becoming disillusioned, swearing it off for awhile, then eventually poking my head back in to see if I should give it another test drive. If it sounds like a crazy process, I tried the same approach with classical music for several years and one day suddenly discovered I was in love. (Fortunately, I never took this approach to dating…)

In the last two months I have finally made my peace with Twitter. There is no longer any love or hate, but I think I have finally come to terms with how I would like to use this communications channel. The easy part is outbound communications, where I have decided to differentiate my Twitter posts from the blog by focusing on three areas, in descending order of importance (at least as I see it):

1.  ‘Retweeting’ commentary and analysis (largely but not entirely investment-related) that I believe deserves a wider audience
2.  Notifying readers of a new post up on VIX and More
3.  Offering impromptu comments about intraday market activity

For those who are interested in following me on Twitter, you can find me at [Twitter.com/VIXandMore](http://twitter.com/VIXandMore)

From my perspective, the more difficult side of Twitter has always been inbound communications, where I prefer not to drink for the proverbial fire hose in real time. I have found that I can keep up with only 2-3 dozen of my favorite Twitter sources – and only for those who tweet no more than a few times per day. So while I get only a small slice of the Twitter community, I get quality input in real time. For the other 300 or so of my regular sources of information, I can always grab their RSS feeds via [Google Reader](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Google%20Reader) or [Bloglines](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Bloglines) and read the material at my leisure.

I have tried a variety of applications which I thought might significantly improve my Twitter experience, including [TweetDeck](http://tweetdeck.com/beta/) and others, but none of these has revolutionized my Twitter experience. For my purposes, the best Twitter application I have used so far is [Twitterfall](http://twitterfall.com/), which I first heard about in [Traders Atwitter Over New Apps](http://www.investorbrain.com/index.php/site/comments/traders_atwitter_over_new_apps/) from Theresa Carey’s excellent [Investor Brain](http://www.investorbrain.com/) blog. Part of the reason I have become a Twitterfall fan is that I can use it to set up filters for keywords such as VIX and VXX – so I can scan the entire Twitterverse in real time to see what is being said about these subjects.

Going forward, I hope to continue to use Twitter as an extension of the blog, to highlight some interesting links as I happen upon them and to offer some intraday market commentary that is probably more appropriate for a microblogging platform than for posting in this space.
