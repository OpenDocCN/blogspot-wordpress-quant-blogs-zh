    of market volatility. With the debt ceiling problem defused, but no sign of a
    DACA deal, the issue of immigration is a worthwhile issue to consider for investors.

    reflect upon how Trump's immigration policy may affect labor markets, and the
    secondary effects on monetary policy. The latest JOLTS report shows that hires
    remain ahead of separations, and the quits rate is rising, which are indicative
    of a strong labor market.

    an opinion on the correct approach. Nevertheless, I can still estimate the likely
    effects of any policy, and its market effects.

    out. Deport the illegals, starting with the DREAMers, or DACA eligible individuals
    residing in the United States.
