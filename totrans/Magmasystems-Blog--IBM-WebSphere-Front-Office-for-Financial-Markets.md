Discussed

on IBM's website.

and from the

[press release](http://www.haifa.ibm.com/info/news_ibm_websphere.html)

on IBM's Haifa Research Lab (bold text is my highlighting) :

*...IBM announced the availability of WebSphere Front Office for Financial Markets, a flexible, high-throughput, low-latency platform. The WebSphere Front Office platform is built on an award-winning portfolio of IBM middleware products that provide an integrated environment **optimized for high-volume trading**.* **Several innovative technologies from the IBM Research Lab in Haifa enabled the platform's performance characteristics and the high availability support including detection, notification and recovery.* **"This is IBM's first appearance in the financial front office space for **stock exchanges and large institutional customers**, which is characterized by extreme data rates measured in **hundreds thousands messages per second**, and by **sub-millisecond delivery latency requirements.**"* **The **Reliable Multicast** Messaging ([RMM](http://www.haifa.ibm.com/projects/software/rmsdk/gridcc.html)) technology and TurboFlow technologies have enabled IBM to address these performance goals and to build an infrastructure that supports the extremely challenging demands of front office financial customers. **In addition to high throughput and low latency, RMM is characterized by significant scalability that allows the delivery of financial information to multiple traders at the same time.*** **Combined with the ITRA (Inter-Tier. Relationship architecture) technology it allows for **subsecond data stream failover**.*

Considering that OPRA (options) data is forcasted to be coming in at 456,000 messages per second, it would be interesting to see if this new product could handle it.

An article in the

[Inside Market Data](http://www.watersinfo.com/news/imd/index_home.asp)

newsletter make specific mention of competition against Reuters and Wombat.
