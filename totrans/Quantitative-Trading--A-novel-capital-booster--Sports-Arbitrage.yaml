- en: As traders, we of course need money to make money, but not everyone has 10-50k
    of capital lying around to start one's trading journey. Perhaps the starting capital
    is only 1k or less. This article describes how one can take a small amount of
    capital and multiply it as much as 10 fold in one year by taking advantage of
    large market inefficiencies (leading to arbitrage opportunities) in the sports
    asset class. However, impressive returns such as this are difficult to achieve
    with significantly larger seed capital, as discussed later.

    this is exceptionally difficult in the financial markets. In contrast, the sports
    markets are very inefficient due to the general lack of trading APIs and patchy
    liquidity etc. Arbitrages can persist for minutes (or even hours at a time).

- en: Consider a very simple example of sports arbitrage; Team A vs Team B and three
    bookmakers quoting the odds shown in the table below. When the odds are expressed
    in decimal form we can calculate the implied probability of the event  e occurring
    as quoted by bookmaker i as  P(i,e) = 1/Odds(i,e)  (shown in brackets in the table).

    A loses or it's a draw. Therefore the sum of the probabilities of these 3 events
    should equal 100% (in a fair market). However, we can see that the market is not
    efficient and the combination of odds shown in red give;

    arbitrage opportunities are 'complex' arbitrages. Complex in the sense that the
    bet legs are not mutually exclusive and more than one leg can pay out over some
    overlapping subset of possible outcomes. The calculation then becomes more complex.

- en: The structure of the Payoff Matrix reveals a 'potential' arbitrage because there
    exists no column (event outcome) that contains only negative cash flows. It is
    a potential 'complex arbitrage' because in the event of a draw or home team win,
    there exists two bet legs that can give rise to a positive cash flow for the same
    outcome (remember, -0.5 means half of the stake is returned so is still positive).
    However, whether or not the arbitrage can be 'realised' depends on whether or
    not we can find a solution for the stake percentages for each leg that gives a
    positive net profit for every outcome. So how do we do this ?

    (60.2%, 34.1%, 5.7%) giving an arbitrage of 1.7% for every possible outcome. There
    are many thousands of these arbitrage opportunities appearing each day in the

    a trading frequency of 3 times per week with an average arbitrage size of 1.6%.
    Initially we compound our winnings but there are limits to how much you can stake
    with a given bookmaker. Assume that we cannot increase our notional beyond £5000
    across any multi-leg arbitrage trade. In that case, the initial £1k can grow to
    approximately £9,500 in one year. Not bad for a few minutes of effort per trade.

    trading capital by a few thousand pounds per year with very small time effort;
    capital which could be put to use in the financial or crypto markets.
