    week coming from the International Swaps and Derivatives Association. They took
    issue with some things I had written in my latest Bloomberg column. I think their
    comment was partially fair, and also partially misleading, so I thought some clarification
    would be useful. The text below is identical to what appears (or will very shortly)
    in Bloomberg:'

- en: from the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. The group objected
    to my characterization of the network of outstanding CDS contracts as "hidden"
    and potentially a source of trouble. I'd like to address their concerns, and also
    raise some questions.

- en: Contrary to the association's claim, I am aware of the existence of the Depository
    Trust & Clearing Corporation. I'll admit to having underestimated how much their
    project to create a warehouse of information on CDS contracts has developed in
    the past few years; my statement that these contracts are not "recorded by any
    central repository" was too strong, as a partial repository does exist, and the
    DTCC deserves great credit for creating it.
  prefs: []

- en: However, it is not clear that this repository gives such a complete picture
    of outstanding CDS linkages that we can all relax.
  prefs: []

- en: For example, DTCC's repository covers 98 percent of all outstanding CDS contracts,
    not 100 percent. Asking why may or may not be a quibble. After all, a map showing
    98 percent of the largest 300 cities in the U.S. could leave out New York, Los
    Angeles, Chicago, Houston and Philadelphia. Moreover, the simple number of contracts
    tells us nothing about the values listed on those contracts. In principle, the
    missing 2 percent of contracts could represent a significant fraction of the outstanding
    value of CDS contracts.

    network, fine details of the network topology -- its architecture or wiring diagram
    -- matter a lot. Indeed, the CDS contracts that put American Insurance Group Inc.
    in grave danger in 2008 represented a tiny fraction -- much less than 1 percent
    -- of the total number of outstanding CDS contracts.

- en: Hence, it would be interesting to know why the repository holds only 98 percent
    rather than 100 percent. There may be a very simple and reassuring answer, but
    it's not readily apparent from DTCC's description of the repository.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Also, there is another issue which makes "fully transparent" not quite the right
    phrase for this network of contracts, even if we suppose the 98 percent leaves
    out nothing of importance.

- en: The DTCC commendably makes its data available to regulators. Still, it appears
    that the full network of interdependencies created by CDS contracts may remain
    opaque to regulators, because DTCC, according to its own description, enables...

- en: '"... each regulator to access reports tailored to their specific entitlements
    as a market regulator, prudential or primary supervisor, or central bank. These
    detailed reports are created for each regulator to show only the CDS data relevant
    to its jurisdiction, regulated entities or currency, at the appropriate level
    of aggregation."'

- en: This would imply, for example, that regulators in the U.S. can look and see
    which of their banks have sold CDS on, say, a big German bank. But the health
    of the U.S. banks then depends directly on the health of that German bank, which
    may in turn have sold CDS on Greek or Italian debt or any number of other things.
    The DTCC data on the latter CDS contracts would, apparently, not be available
    to U.S. regulators, being out of their jurisdiction.

- en: The point is that a financial institution is at risk not only from contracts
    it has entered into, but also from contracts that its many counterparties have
    entered into (this is the whole idea of systemic risk linked to the possibility
    of contagion). Credible tests of the financial network's resilience require a
    truly global analysis of the potential pathways along which distress (particularly
    from outright counterparty failures) may spread. It's not clear that any regulator
    has the full data on which such an analysis can be based.

- en: None of this, by any means, is meant as a criticism of DTCC or what it has done
    in the past few years. The 98 percent figure is impressive, and let's hope the
    98 percent soon becomes 100 percent and the DTCC finds a way to make ALL information
    in the repository available to regulators everywhere. Even better would be full
    disclosure to the public.

- en: Of course, nothing in the comment from the International Swaps and Derivatives
    Association changes the main point of my column, which was that it is incorrect
    to believe that more CDS contracts -- or, more generally, more financial interdependencies
    of any kind, including links created by other derivatives such as interest-rate
    swaps -- automatically lead to better risk-sharing and a safer banking system.
    More apparent risk-sharing can actually mean more systemic risk and less overall
    banking safety.
