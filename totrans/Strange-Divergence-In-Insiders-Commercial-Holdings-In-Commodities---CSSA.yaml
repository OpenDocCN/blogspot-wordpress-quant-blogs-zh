- en: The market is no simple beast, its actions are rarely as obvious as people believe.
    Often it seems to lull unsuspecting traders into “obvious” setups just in time
    to take your money away in one quick swoop. Its is plainly obvious that the Federal
    Reserve is printing money with no end in site, thus it should be obvious that
    inflation will creep in with a vengeance-taking the form of rising commodities
    and gold. So far, we have gold hitting new all-time highs and other commodities
    like oil and copper have rallied significantly since the bottom. I remember times
    like this in early 2008, where it seemed as if every commodity would rise to the
    moon (i was long). I also remember looking at the COT report and noticing that
    the insiders had their lowest position in the CRB commodity index as well as Oil
    and Gold—ie the COT stochastic was at zero. I barely got out alive with a few
    scraps of remaining profit as the CRB crashed at rapid speed. So here we are again,
    its late 2009, and strangely we are in the same spot–the commercials are at zero
    [http://www.insidercapital.com/BullishReview/COTINDEX.HTM](http://www.insidercapital.com/BullishReview/COTINDEX.HTM) 
    I wish I knew why this was the case and I can only speculate, but I will say that
    if these insiders were really convinced that commodities would be rising 20 or
    30% more in the near future they certainly wouldn’t have such a small position.
    It appears that they are hedging their bets, and perhaps afraid of a double dip.
    Why should we watch the insiders? Because trading on inside information is perfectly
    legal in the futures markets in direct contrast to the stock market. Insiders
    must disclose their positions, yet obviously they will want to profit from superior
    information. Thus their moves are worth watching.

  zh: 市场并非简单的野兽，其行为很少像人们认为的那样明显。经常似乎会安抚那些不知不觉的交易者进入“明显”的设置，正好一次性把你的钱拿走。很明显，美联储正在无休止地印钞票，因此很明显，通货膨胀将会以复仇的形式猛涨——表现为商品和黄金的上涨。到目前为止，黄金已经创下了新的历史高点，其他商品如石油和铜自底部以来已经反弹显著。我记得2008年初是这样的，当时似乎每种商品都会涨到天上（我当时做多）。我还记得查看COT报告时注意到，内部人士在CRB商品指数以及石油和黄金的持仓降至最低——即COT随机指标为零。我在CRB快速崩溃时，仅带着微薄的利润残存下来。所以现在又到了同样的情况，2009年底，奇怪的是我们处于同样的位置——商业持仓为零
    [http://www.insidercapital.com/BullishReview/COTINDEX.HTM](http://www.insidercapital.com/BullishReview/COTINDEX.HTM)
    我希望我知道这是为什么，但我只能猜测，我会说如果这些内部人士真的确信商品会在不久的将来上涨20%或30%，他们绝对不会持如此小的仓位。看起来他们在下注，也许害怕二次探底。我们为什么要关注内部人士？因为在未来股市场交易内部信息是完全合法的，与股票市场直接相反。内部人士必须披露他们的持仓，但显然他们希望利用更优越的信息获利。因此，他们的动作值得关注。
- en: What is the “little guy” or small trader doing? He is absolutely backing up
    the truck on Oil in this spot. The record for small traders needless to say is
    quite poor relative to the big boys. **Now I wouldn’t run out and short every
    commodity I could find on this information (for one gas is highly bullish right
    now based on insider positions). I would wait for a major channel to be broken,
    or go short  incrementally on a new 20 day low, 50 day low and 100 day low. For
    now, if I was long, I would trim positions and keep a trailing stop in place.**
    The risk/reward may be to the downside in the future—but the probability is not
    neccessarily high. It is just that crowded trades end badly when everyone stampedes
    for the exits. A rise in the US dollar will cause the carry trade to unwind and
    massacre commodity related positions.

  zh: “小散”或小型交易者在做什么？他绝对是在这个位置上大量买入石油。小型交易者的记录不用说相对大型交易者来说是非常糟糕的。**现在我不会根据这个信息去做空我能找到的所有商品（因为首先基于内部人士的头寸，天然气目前是非常看涨的）。我会等待一个主要通道被打破，或者在新低的20天、50天和100天处逐渐做空。现在，如果我持有多头头寸，我会减仓并保持跟踪止损。**未来风险/收益可能偏向下行——但概率并不一定很高。只是拥挤的交易最终都会以糟糕的方式结束。美元的上涨将导致套利交易平仓，并屠杀与商品相关的头寸。
