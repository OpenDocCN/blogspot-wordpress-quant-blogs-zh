- en: This weekend I spent a fair portion of my time watching the  Winter Olympics.
    It is a real-life field experiment where a spectator can gain some insight into what
    it takes to be the best in any discipline. Athletes get only one chance in  four
    years to compete for Olympic gold, and the stakes are incredibly high. What I
    find the most remarkable, is the disproportionate amount of preparation and training
    versus the time spent competing in the event. Many of the downhill skiers, or
    the speed skaters are in action for all of a few minutes in total during the whole
    Olympics. Few can begin to appreciate the enormous amount of personal sacrifice
    it takes to even compete at this level and the pressure that it creates for the athletes.  To
    me this situation is only loosely familiar having spent several years as a competitive
    swimmer in high school.  I would train for weeks-spending countless hours in practice
    staring at the dark line at the bottom of the pool. Once the competition finally
    arrived, I would stand on the blocks and realize that winning would all come down
    to what I could do in a mere 25 seconds or less. There was no time to think anymore-no
    turning back, and my heart was pounding with adrenaline. Once the gun sounded,
    the difference between myself and the next person was very small–it came down
    to talent, training, and execution. The higher the level of competition, the smaller
    the gap in talent and the more the outcome of the race was determined by the other
    two factors.

    Olympics is remarkably small in terms of natural ability–unless you consider a
    fraction of a second statistically significant. It is a lot easier to predict
    that a favorite for an event will win a medal versus predicting the remaining
    distribution of places. The athletes that place the highest on average (other
    things being nearly equal), are simply better prepared,  better able to execute
    under pressure, and gracefully adapt to changing conditions. There were a lot
    of medal winners who made mistakes in either the qualifying rounds, or even in
    the main event. Sometimes they were the victims of bad luck or poor conditions.
    But the difference between the medal-winners and the other athletes, was that
    they did not give up and managed to recover and often improve.

    that many of the same traits required to be an Olympian are needed to succeed
    in trading. Like it or not, trading is in fact a competitive zero-sum game, and
    to be a winner you have to be willing to make a lot of sacrifices. If you think
    that you can read a couple books, and trade from 9:30 to 4pm and then take the
    rest of the night off you are horribly mistaken. Just take a look at your competition:
    whether its high frequency, institutional, or just veteran independent traders,
    they probably have a leg up on you in every single area from education to experience.
    They are probably smarter than you too, and unlike the Olympics, they are permitted
    to play by a different set of rules with better equipment.'

    you might as well just become a passive investor. Even if you have some talent, given
    that you probably have less access to resources than most of your competition only
    thing you can change is: 1) how hard you train and 2) how well you execute in
    real-time with the money on the line. Here is the real truth: whether you are
    a discretionary trader or a system designer/quant (such as myself), if you want
    to have a realistic shot of succeeding you will have to work MORE than 40hrs a
    week and have LESS free time than the average office worker. Do you think any
    Olympians (no matter how gifted) simply showed up without a lifetime of practice?
     Malcolm Gladwell is famous for highlighting that you need 10,000 hours to become
    an expert in just about anything. If this is the case than  trading probably requires
    20,000 hours because the skills/knowledge needed to succeed are always changing.
    That means that if you really want to have a shot, you are going to have to sacrifice
    many things that everyday workers take for granted. You are not getting a paycheque
    to be average and follow the rules, a trader gets paid only for being better than
    average. These silly dreams people have of sitting on the beach and pressing a
    few buttons on their laptop are what make vendors rich–not their customers. NO
    ONE I know or have read about who is a SUCCESSFUL professional trader ever spent
    their early years on easy street. Invariably, all of their stories revolve around
    repeated failure and learning some very costly lessons the hard way.'

- en: Its not even about just working hard, its about working smart–and learning as
    much as possible while re-inventing the wheel only if neccessary. Find a coach,
    read plenty of books, take detailed notes, ask lots of good questions from good
    teachers.  You also have to specialize–athletes generally focus on one sport in
    the Olympics, and spend all their time mastering the most minute nuances.  It
    doesn’t matter what your style is as a trader, so much as it matters how well
    you know your own style. Ultimately if you do not know your own style inside out,
    you will lose confidence the first time you have a drawdown and completely collapse.
    This is where training intersects with execution. Would you want to do a backflip
    on a mogul run at highway speeds after having practiced a handful of times? Well
    that is what many traders expect to do, and even though they may have the capability
    of doing backflips they aren’t ready for the big time. The whole mental aspect
    of both sports and tradings is a huge topic that can’t be adequately summarized.
    But one thing you have to realize is that no matter how good you are, no matter
    how much you practiced, you are only as good as what you actually do during the
    trading day. Whether playing poker professionally, or in competitive swimming,
    I always noticed that there were a lot of people who didn’t make it simply because
    they couldn’t make this transition. To bridge this gap, you have to be confident,
    and you have to constantly monitor yourself to make sure you are doing what you
    are supposed to do–which is incredibly hard to do when things go badly. There
    is no one best way to tackle this problem, any more than there is a best style
    to trade. The key is you have to know yourself inside and out, while finding a
    method that works for you.
