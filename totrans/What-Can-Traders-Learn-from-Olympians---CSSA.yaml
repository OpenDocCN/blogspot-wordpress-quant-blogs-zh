- en: This weekend I spent a fair portion of my time watching the  Winter Olympics.
    It is a real-life field experiment where a spectator can gain some insight into what
    it takes to be the best in any discipline. Athletes get only one chance in  four
    years to compete for Olympic gold, and the stakes are incredibly high. What I
    find the most remarkable, is the disproportionate amount of preparation and training
    versus the time spent competing in the event. Many of the downhill skiers, or
    the speed skaters are in action for all of a few minutes in total during the whole
    Olympics. Few can begin to appreciate the enormous amount of personal sacrifice
    it takes to even compete at this level and the pressure that it creates for the athletes.  To
    me this situation is only loosely familiar having spent several years as a competitive
    swimmer in high school.  I would train for weeks-spending countless hours in practice
    staring at the dark line at the bottom of the pool. Once the competition finally
    arrived, I would stand on the blocks and realize that winning would all come down
    to what I could do in a mere 25 seconds or less. There was no time to think anymore-no
    turning back, and my heart was pounding with adrenaline. Once the gun sounded,
    the difference between myself and the next person was very small–it came down
    to talent, training, and execution. The higher the level of competition, the smaller
    the gap in talent and the more the outcome of the race was determined by the other
    two factors.

  zh: 这个周末，我花了相当一部分时间观看了冬季奥运会。这是一个真实的现场实验，观众可以深入了解成为任何领域最优秀的人所需要的东西。运动员每四年只有一次机会参加奥运会争夺奥运金牌，赌注非常高。我发现最令人印象深刻的是，相比参加比赛的时间，准备和训练的时间是多么的不成比例。许多滑雪选手或速滑选手在整个冬季奥运会期间只会进行几分钟的比赛。很少有人能够理解到达这个水平所需的巨大个人牺牲以及这给运动员带来的压力。对我来说，这种情况有些熟悉，因为我在高中时期作为一名竞技游泳运动员度过了几年。我会训练几个星期——花费无数个小时在练习中盯着泳池底部的黑线。一旦比赛终于到来，我会站在出发台上意识到，胜利将完全取决于我在短短的25秒内能做什么。再也没有时间思考了——没有回头的余地，我的心脏随着肾上腺素的激增而狂跳。一旦枪声响起，我和下一个人之间的差距就非常小——这取决于天赋、训练和执行力。竞争水平越高，天赋差距就越小，比赛结果更多地由其他两个因素决定。
- en: The difference between the top and bottom 10% of athletes in any sport in the
    Olympics is remarkably small in terms of natural ability–unless you consider a
    fraction of a second statistically significant. It is a lot easier to predict
    that a favorite for an event will win a medal versus predicting the remaining
    distribution of places. The athletes that place the highest on average (other
    things being nearly equal), are simply better prepared,  better able to execute
    under pressure, and gracefully adapt to changing conditions. There were a lot
    of medal winners who made mistakes in either the qualifying rounds, or even in
    the main event. Sometimes they were the victims of bad luck or poor conditions.
    But the difference between the medal-winners and the other athletes, was that
    they did not give up and managed to recover and often improve.

  zh: 在奥运会上，任何一项运动中排名前10%和后10%的运动员之间的差别在自然能力方面非常小——除非你认为一秒钟的差异在统计学上具有重要意义。相比较而言，预测一位事件的冠军会获得奖牌相对容易，而预测剩余名次的分布则困难得多。在各项平均排名最高的运动员（其他条件几乎相同）中，他们只是准备更充分，更能够在压力下执行，并且能够优雅地适应不断变化的条件。许多奖牌获得者在预赛或者甚至主要比赛中都犯过错误。有时候，他们是厄运的受害者或者是不利条件的受害者。但是奖牌得主和其他运动员之间的区别在于，他们没有放弃，设法恢复并且往往取得了进步。
- en: 'While I am not a full-time discretionary trader, it is not a stretch to assert
    that many of the same traits required to be an Olympian are needed to succeed
    in trading. Like it or not, trading is in fact a competitive zero-sum game, and
    to be a winner you have to be willing to make a lot of sacrifices. If you think
    that you can read a couple books, and trade from 9:30 to 4pm and then take the
    rest of the night off you are horribly mistaken. Just take a look at your competition:
    whether its high frequency, institutional, or just veteran independent traders,
    they probably have a leg up on you in every single area from education to experience.
    They are probably smarter than you too, and unlike the Olympics, they are permitted
    to play by a different set of rules with better equipment.'

  zh: 虽然我不是一个全职自由裁量交易者，但可以肯定地说，要成功交易所需的许多特质与成功成为奥林匹克运动员所需的特质相同。不管你喜欢与否，交易实际上是一个竞争激烈的零和游戏，要成为赢家，你必须愿意做出很多牺牲。如果你认为你可以读几本书，从早上9:30交易到下午4点，然后就可以休息了，那你大错特错了。只要看看你的竞争对手：无论是高频交易、机构交易，还是经验丰富的独立交易者，他们在从教育到经验的每一个领域都可能比你更有优势。他们可能比你聪明，而且与奥运会不同，他们被允许按照不同的规则使用更好的设备。
- en: 'Talent is something that you can’t change–if you don’t have any of  it, then
    you might as well just become a passive investor. Even if you have some talent, given
    that you probably have less access to resources than most of your competition only
    thing you can change is: 1) how hard you train and 2) how well you execute in
    real-time with the money on the line. Here is the real truth: whether you are
    a discretionary trader or a system designer/quant (such as myself), if you want
    to have a realistic shot of succeeding you will have to work MORE than 40hrs a
    week and have LESS free time than the average office worker. Do you think any
    Olympians (no matter how gifted) simply showed up without a lifetime of practice?
     Malcolm Gladwell is famous for highlighting that you need 10,000 hours to become
    an expert in just about anything. If this is the case than  trading probably requires
    20,000 hours because the skills/knowledge needed to succeed are always changing.
    That means that if you really want to have a shot, you are going to have to sacrifice
    many things that everyday workers take for granted. You are not getting a paycheque
    to be average and follow the rules, a trader gets paid only for being better than
    average. These silly dreams people have of sitting on the beach and pressing a
    few buttons on their laptop are what make vendors rich–not their customers. NO
    ONE I know or have read about who is a SUCCESSFUL professional trader ever spent
    their early years on easy street. Invariably, all of their stories revolve around
    repeated failure and learning some very costly lessons the hard way.'

  zh: 人才是一种无法改变的东西——如果你一点都没有，那么你最好就成为一个被动投资者。即使你有一些天赋，鉴于你可能比大多数竞争对手更少地接触资源，你能改变的唯一事情是：1）你训练得有多努力，2）你在真实场景中执行得有多好，有钱在赌局上。这是真实的道理：无论你是一名自由裁量交易者还是一个系统设计师/量化交易员（如我），如果你想要有成功的机会，你将不得不工作超过40小时，并且比普通办公室工作者拥有更少的空闲时间。你认为任何一位奥运会选手（无论多么有天赋）都是毫无经过练习的生来天才吗？马尔科姆·格拉德威尔因强调你需要10000小时才能成为任何领域的专家而出名。如果这是事实，那么交易可能需要20000小时，因为成功所需的技能/知识总是在变化。这意味着，如果你真的想要机会，你将不得不牺牲很多普通工作者认为理所当然的事情。你不是为了平庸和遵循规则而拿薪水，交易员只有比平均水平更优秀才能得到报酬。人们梦想着坐在海滩上，在笔记本电脑上按几个按钮，这些傻梦想使供应商致富——而不是他们的顾客。我认识的或者读过的任何一个成功的专业交易者，在他们的早年从未轻松过。无论如何，他们所有的故事都围绕着反复的失败和以艰难的方式学到的一些非常昂贵的教训。
- en: Its not even about just working hard, its about working smart–and learning as
    much as possible while re-inventing the wheel only if neccessary. Find a coach,
    read plenty of books, take detailed notes, ask lots of good questions from good
    teachers.  You also have to specialize–athletes generally focus on one sport in
    the Olympics, and spend all their time mastering the most minute nuances.  It
    doesn’t matter what your style is as a trader, so much as it matters how well
    you know your own style. Ultimately if you do not know your own style inside out,
    you will lose confidence the first time you have a drawdown and completely collapse.
    This is where training intersects with execution. Would you want to do a backflip
    on a mogul run at highway speeds after having practiced a handful of times? Well
    that is what many traders expect to do, and even though they may have the capability
    of doing backflips they aren’t ready for the big time. The whole mental aspect
    of both sports and tradings is a huge topic that can’t be adequately summarized.
    But one thing you have to realize is that no matter how good you are, no matter
    how much you practiced, you are only as good as what you actually do during the
    trading day. Whether playing poker professionally, or in competitive swimming,
    I always noticed that there were a lot of people who didn’t make it simply because
    they couldn’t make this transition. To bridge this gap, you have to be confident,
    and you have to constantly monitor yourself to make sure you are doing what you
    are supposed to do–which is incredibly hard to do when things go badly. There
    is no one best way to tackle this problem, any more than there is a best style
    to trade. The key is you have to know yourself inside and out, while finding a
    method that works for you.

  zh: 这甚至不仅仅是努力工作，而是要**工作聪明**——在重新发明轮子只有在必要时尽可能多地学习。找到一个教练，读很多书，做详细的笔记，向好老师问很多好问题。你也必须专攻——奥运会的运动员通常专注于一项运动，并花费所有时间掌握最微小的细微差别。作为交易者，你的风格并不重要，重要的是你有多了解自己的风格。最终，如果你不是对自己的风格了如指掌，第一次出现回撤你就会失去信心并完全崩溃。这就是培训与执行交汇的地方。你愿意在高速公路上的颠簸跑道上做一次后空翻，然后只练了几次吗？好多交易者就是期望这样做的，即使他们也许有做后空翻的能力，但他们还没有准备好迎接大场面。体育和交易的整个心理方面是一个庞大的主题，无法充分概括。但你必须意识到的一件事是，无论你有多优秀，无论你练习了多少，你在交易日所做的决定才是最重要的。无论是专业玩扑克还是竞技游泳，我总是注意到有很多人因为无法完成这一转变而未能成功。为了弥合这个差距，你必须自信，并不断监督自己，确保你在做你应该做的事——当情况恶化时这是极其困难的。解决这个问题没有最佳方式，就像没有最佳的交易风格一样。关键是你必须对自己了如指掌，同时找到适合你的方法。
