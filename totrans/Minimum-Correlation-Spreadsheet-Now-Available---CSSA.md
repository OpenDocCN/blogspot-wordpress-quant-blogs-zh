# Minimum Correlation Spreadsheet Now Available | CSSA

> 来源：[https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2012/10/16/minimum-correlation-spreadsheet-now-available/#0001-01-01](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2012/10/16/minimum-correlation-spreadsheet-now-available/#0001-01-01)

This spreadsheet shows the implementation of the Minimum Correlation Algorithm (mincorr). The power function is a new parameter that regulates the weighting in the averaging process toward the most anti-correlated assets. Currently the default is “1” which is essentially a rank-weighted moving average of pair-wise correlations.  A value of “0” would imply equal weightings, values lower than 1 would imply a balance between equal and rank weighting, while values higher than 1 would more heavily skew the rank-weighting. More spreadsheets and research will be available soon.
