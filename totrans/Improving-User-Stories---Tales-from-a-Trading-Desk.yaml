    your User Stories”.  Before I provide some thoughts on the book, its worth stating
    the obvious: a large number of organisation have their own variant of agile. 
    These variants of agile can be many degrees away from the original intent of agile. 
    Its therefore not surprising that, when reading “Fifty Quick Ideas to Improve
    your User Stories”, you may find some of the ideas unworkable within your project
    area.'

- en: Page 10, “If a team passively receives documents in a hand-over…that’s not really
    working with user stories”.   Telling stories is the correct agile approach. 
    Unfortunately, this is often countered when there is a void between the Product
    Owner and the team.  Tension between both parties and ever changing stories can
    lead to issues, which team then begin to go down the road of lightweight requirements.
