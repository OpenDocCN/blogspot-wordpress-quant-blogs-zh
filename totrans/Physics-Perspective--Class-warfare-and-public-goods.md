I think

[this](http://www.rumproast.com/index.php/site/comments/i_got_your_class_warfare_right_here/)

is about the best short description I've heard yet of why wealth isn't created by heroic individuals (

*a la*

Ayn Rand's most potent fantasies). I just wish Elizabeth Warren had been appointed head of the new Bureau of Consumer Protection. Based on the words below, I can see why there was intense opposition from Wall St. She's obviously not a Randroid:

> I hear all this, you know, “Well, this is class warfare, this is whatever.”—No!
> 
> There is nobody in this country who got rich on his own. Nobody.
> 
> You built a factory out there—good for you! But I want to be clear.
> 
> You moved your goods to market on the roads the rest of us paid for.
> 
> You hired workers the rest of us paid to educate.
> 
> You were safe in your factory because of police forces and fire forces that the
> rest of us paid for.
> 
> You didn’t have to worry that maurauding bands would come and seize everything at your factory, and hire someone to protect against this, because of the work the rest of us did.
> 
> Now look, you built a factory and it turned into something terrific, or a great idea—God bless. Keep a big hunk of it.
> 
> But part of the underlying social contract is you take a hunk of that and pay forward for the next kid who comes along.
