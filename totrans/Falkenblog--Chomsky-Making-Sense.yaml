    We are preprogrammed in a way that makes learning speech easy, in that almost
    everyone does it without much training. A small amount of rather degenerate experience
    allows us to make a leap into a rich cognitive system using an innate structure
    that is today still quite mysterious. In comparison, people need years of training
    to learn mathematics, or writing. It''s really a fascinating insight into the
    human mind.'

    and deduction. The state we would achieve merely by this method would be a reflection
    of our environment, which means it would be extraordinarily impoverished and show
    much more variability than what we observe.

    possible. Though unlike most leftists of the 1960s, he believed in some innate
    nature of man, in other aspects he was a typical socialist, whose theory of economics
    is merely a critique of capitalism as opposed to anything positive or realistic.
    In his view of human nature people are eager to work for collectives that capture
    all the great gifts of mankind, but big government or corporations are always
    frustrating these efforts. Chomsky thinks anyone with power is evil, which conflates
    many shades of gray. That is, ignorant foragers in the jungle are noble savages,
    even though they have little enlightenment and high homocide rates, merely because
    they are not efficient enough to affect others. Further, because the US is powerful,
    it necessarily is more repressive than any other government. Tell that to all
    the immigrants who want to move here.
