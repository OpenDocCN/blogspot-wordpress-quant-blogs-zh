- en: Due to the mass of email/code/stuff one get each day, sometimes it takes me
    a while to get round to reading everything.  Hence somewhat delayed, but still
    worth mentioning is a now slightly old article by [Low-Latency.com](http://low-latency.com/),
    Measuring Latency in Equity [Transactions](http://low-latency.com/article/measuring-latency-equity-transactions). 
    The article provide figures for  State-of-the-Art Latency general usage connections,
    coupled with a good overview of latency in financial markets from a viewpoint
    of exchanges.  Page 6 gives some  key latency numbers for asset classes.  Figure
    4 should be familiar to anyone who’s working in the venue connectivity space. 
    Table 3 is relevant to anyone working or considering working in the global trading
    connectivity space.
