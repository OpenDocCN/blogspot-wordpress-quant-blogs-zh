Buoyed by [rumors that the company may be up for sale](http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/070328/nbty_mover.html?.v=1), shares of NTY rallied 4.8% this week, helping to propel Portfolio A1’s cumulative performance to 2.4% better than the benchmark S&P 500 index.  This week’s strong performance means that all five holdings are now in the black, with <state st="on"><place st="on">TEX</place></state>’s 7.8% return leading the way.  Details of the recent performance of the holdings are as follows:

Once again, there are no changes to the portfolio for the coming week.

A snapshot of the portfolio is as follows:

(In other portfolio news, I am pleased to report that I am now #3158 in the [CNBC Million Dollar Portfolio Challenge](http://contests.cnbc.com/milliondollar/contestmain.do). While I am happy that my 29% return puts me in the top 1%, the last I checked the top 10 contestants were all sporting returns of better than 100%, meaning that it will likely take a return of 200% or more to be among the top ten finalists on May 14^(th).  I have already resorted to a one stock ‘portfolio’ and expect to be increasing my volatility and taking substantially more risk in the coming week.)
