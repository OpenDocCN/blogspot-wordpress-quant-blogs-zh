    useful to see what we have learned, and how market expectations have developed
    through this pandemic period.

- en: reported that the bottom-up consensus forward 12-month estimate fell -1.9% last
    week, and -18.3% since downgrades began seven weeks ago. I have been monitoring
    the evolution of forward 12-month EPS for several years, and this level of revision
    is extraordinarily high. In the past, the magnitude of weekly revisions was usually
    about 0.1%, and swings of 0.2% would be considered high. Now, revisions are an
    order of magnitude higher at 1% or more. In addition, estimates have been falling
    while stock prices have been rising.

    In fact, 47 companies withdrew their 2020 EPS guidance for the full year as management
    as uncertainty rose. However, there is a remedy for investors looking for greater
    clarity on the earnings outlook.
