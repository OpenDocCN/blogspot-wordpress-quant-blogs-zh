to John Maynard Keynes.

> John Maynard Keynes, he was tall and had a lot of brains

> 
> John Maynard Keynes, read his books each and every time it rains
> 
> chorus: you'll get lots of knowledge you can use in college
> 
> John Maynard Keynes, he instructs, even as he entertains,
> if your fond of the comics, your gonna love economics
> 
> John Maynard Keynes, favorite author of travelers of planes
> 
> chorus: you will find no fun way, to pass the time, on a runway
> 
> John Maynard Keynes, sing it often the verses and refrains
> 
> You can't help being cheery with Employment Theory
> coursing through your veins,
> like John Maynard Keynes
