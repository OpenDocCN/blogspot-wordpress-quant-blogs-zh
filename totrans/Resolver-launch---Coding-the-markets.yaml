- en: I went to the [Resolver One](http://www.resolversystems.com/news/) launch party
    last week, and had a pleasant evening soaking up wine and nibbles, and meeting
    [Giles and Robert](http://www.resolversystems.com/management.php), the depressingly
    young management team. It was good to see all that startup energy and passion.

- en: The Resolver team have an excellent product, but I think they need to improve
    the way they present it. The presenters all made basic errors, like not telling
    us who they are, facing the screen and reading the slides (evidence of under rehearsal),
    and not hammering home the key message by restating it. I think canned demos that
    illustrate specific applications are needed too. Basically the Resolver guys need
    a bit of slick sales snake oil.
