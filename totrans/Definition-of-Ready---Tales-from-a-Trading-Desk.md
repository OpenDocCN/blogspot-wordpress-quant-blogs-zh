# Definition of Ready | Tales from a Trading Desk

## Definition of Ready

You’ll always hear about the Definition of Done (DOD) from agile teams.  However, what is not so often discussed is Definition of Ready (DOR) – sometimes referred to as DevReady in various organisations. Fabrique’s SXSW 2013 slide [deck](http://www.slideshare.net/fabriquenl/sxsw2013-fabpieter-130309-ss) (53) offers a view of DOR.   The Agile Alliance [crystallises](http://guide.agilealliance.org/guide/definition-of-ready.html) why DOR is important:

> Avoids beginning work on features that do not have clearly defined completion criteria, which usually translates into costly back-and-forth discussion or rework

Churn during iteration due to imprecise requirements is often the by-product of not having a strict DOR.
