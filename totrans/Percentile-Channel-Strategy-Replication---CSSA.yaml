- en: Michael Kapler of the always excellent [Systematic Investor](https://systematicinvestor.wordpress.com/)
    blog has moved his publishing to GitHub to make it easier to post code. This has
    flown under the radar (even to me), and we are all grateful that he is back to
    publishing. He was able to reproduce the “[Simple Tactical Asset Allocation with
    Percentile Channel Strategy](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2015/01/26/a-simple-tactical-asset-allocation-portfolio-with-percentile-channels/
    "A Simple Tactical Asset Allocation Portfolio with Percentile Channels")” in his
    recent post [here](http://systematicinvestor.github.io/Channel-Breakout2/).

    including 1)ew- equal weight the assets in the portfolio 2)rp- risk parity using
    the assets in the portfolio and 3) channel ew: the percentile channel TAA strategy
    using equal weighting 4) QATAA- which is the application of Mebane Faber’s trend-following
    strategy cited in his now famous paper- [A Quantitative Approach to Tactical Asset
    Allocation](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=962461) (in this
    case QATAA uses the same underlying assets and cash allocation as the percentile
    TAA strategy). Of course QATAA is one of the inspirations for the strategy framework
    and Meb always manages to publish interesting ideas on his [World Beta blog](http://mebfaber.com/).
    To avoid issues with different sources of extended data, **Systematic Investor
    begins the test in 2010 using the underlying ETF data** to show how the strategies
    have performed in the current bull market. If you are getting results in line
    with this test than you can feel comfortable that you have the details correct-
    if not you can use R and the code provided by Systematic Investor in the post.'

- en: After comparing results, Michael and I show an near identical match (I also
    get a sharpe of 1.42 and a CAGR of 8.93%) – a relief after all the commotion caused
    by the initial post (which was addressed in my now amusing rant over [here](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2015/02/08/a-simple-tactical-asset-allocation-portfolio-with-percentile-channels-for-dummies/
    "A “Simple” Tactical Asset Allocation Portfolio with Percentile Channels (for
    Dummies)")). The original strategy is the best performer of the bunch since it
    applies multiple time frames as well as normalized bet sizing via risk parity
    (common for most trend-followers). As I have stated before, of the reasons I like
    the Percentile Channel approach is that the signals are likely to be slightly
    different from what most asset managers and investors are using.
