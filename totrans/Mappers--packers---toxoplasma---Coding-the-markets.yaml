    when I first read it in the late 90s, the mapper/packer distinction really hit
    the nail on the head. When he went on to [diagnose the roots](http://www.the-programmers-stone.com/about)
    of that behavioural distinction as [dopamine driven ritual stress addiction](http://the-programmers-stone.com/about/neuroscience/)
    I heard a lot of echoes of the mindless proceduralism that I see in investment
    bank IT departments.

    and how it’s been empirically determined to reduce novelty seeking behaviour,
    and increase neurotic behaviour reminded me of Alan’s work. I wonder if he’s aware
    of toxoplasma as a candidate cause of stress addiction ?
