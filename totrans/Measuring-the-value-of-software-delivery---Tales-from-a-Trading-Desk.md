## Measuring the value of software delivery

Googling the web will provide a whole slew of views on measuring the value of delivery.  Numerous [articles](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/measuring-success-measuring-value) reference agile delivery, and prioritised backlogs.  Clearly the [financial](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/how-do-you-measure-value) cost of a feature is important to the value of a feature.

Aside from the quality, cost, and velocity of delivering a feature to assess its value, you may want to consider what metric (following Amazon’s culture of [metrics](https://www.businessmanagementdaily.com/31500/inside-amazons-culture-of-metrics)) will provide an indication of the value of a feature.  This maybe a simple as measuring the number of users adopting a feature, and driving the adoption as appropriate.

Metrics in clearly important in understanding value.  As is the right metrics 🙂
