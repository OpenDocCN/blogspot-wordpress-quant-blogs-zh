- en: I don’t get the mentality of forcing new developers to incur time and effort
    to join a project and get productive.  Over the years, some of the worst on-boarding
    experiences I’ve seen have run for a duration of 3 days, and highlighted flaws
    in process/procedures and wiki notes. Its in some ways shocking, and shows in
    my view a lack of due care and attention to detail, let alone the hit taken on
    the team themselves to assist any new team member.  Further, just the hit in terms
    of velocity probably hasn’t been considered, and thus cost.

    to Production Deployments” should aid in setting the bar for getting a development
    environment up and running.
