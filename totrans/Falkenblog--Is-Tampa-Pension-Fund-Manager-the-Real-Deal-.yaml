- en: Jay Bowen's stock picking has made the Tampa Firefighters and Police Officers
    Pension Fund one of the best-performing public pensions in the U.S.... As of Dec.
    31, Mr. Bowen's annual returns beat pension giant Calpers—which employs 125 consultants
    and 1,100 money managers—over three-year, five-year and 10-year spans.  ...The
    Tampa fund appears to be well funded at about 90%. It uses an unusually high annual
    investment target and discount rate of 10% to calculate the present value of benefits
    owed to retirees.

    the past 10 years is not an anomaly, but rather, a statistical certainty. Given
    Tampa discounts their liabilities by 10%, implying an expected return of 7% or
    so, I suspect that statistical logic isn't their strong suit, so they simply see
    this case in isolation, and infer his return based on what looks to them like
    a long track record, over ten years.  As the housing bubble showed, you can't
    argue against someone who has outperformed over the past 10 years, so I'm sure
    they are going with their rosy assumption, which I bet will fail with a high probability.

    take his clients to lunch or dinner, and tell them a long, happy tail about an
    old client of his firm who had simply put away a modest amount in a company they
    recommended for over 20 years, and by the time she retired, she had tens of millions
    of dollars and spent most of her time on charity. This fantasy was very appealing
    because it really happened, as Home Depot was one of those stocks that went up
    100 fold over its lifetime. Further, doling out charity is a great way to enjoy
    high status in your golden years without guilt: it''s something the non-rich simply
    can''t do'
