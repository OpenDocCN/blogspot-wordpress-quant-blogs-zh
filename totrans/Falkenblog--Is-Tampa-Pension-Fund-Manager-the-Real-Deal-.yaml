- en: Jay Bowen's stock picking has made the Tampa Firefighters and Police Officers
    Pension Fund one of the best-performing public pensions in the U.S.... As of Dec.
    31, Mr. Bowen's annual returns beat pension giant Calpers—which employs 125 consultants
    and 1,100 money managers—over three-year, five-year and 10-year spans.  ...The
    Tampa fund appears to be well funded at about 90%. It uses an unusually high annual
    investment target and discount rate of 10% to calculate the present value of benefits
    owed to retirees.

  zh: Jay Bowen的股票选取使得坦帕消防和警察工会养老基金成为美国表现最好的公共养老基金之一... 截至12月31日，Bowen先生的年回报率战胜了养老基金巨头Calpers——后者雇佣了125名顾问和1100名基金经理——在过去三年、五年和十年中...
    坦帕基金似乎资金充裕，达到了90%左右。它使用了非常高的年度投资目标和10%的折现率来计算应付给退休人员的福利的现值。
- en: The fact that a particular manager has generated above average returns over
    the past 10 years is not an anomaly, but rather, a statistical certainty. Given
    Tampa discounts their liabilities by 10%, implying an expected return of 7% or
    so, I suspect that statistical logic isn't their strong suit, so they simply see
    this case in isolation, and infer his return based on what looks to them like
    a long track record, over ten years.  As the housing bubble showed, you can't
    argue against someone who has outperformed over the past 10 years, so I'm sure
    they are going with their rosy assumption, which I bet will fail with a high probability.

  zh: 过去10年内某特定经理取得的高于平均水平的回报并非偶然，而是统计学上的必然。假设坦帕市以10%的折现率计算负债，表明预期回报率约为7%，我怀疑他们并不擅长统计逻辑，于是他们只看到这个案例，然后基于在他们看来是长期的记录，推断他的回报。正如房地产泡沫所示，你无法反驳过去10年内取得超额回报的经理，所以我相信他们正在坚持他们乐观的假设，我敢打赌这个假设有很高概率失败。
- en: 'This reminds me of a sales pitch a neighbor broker once told me about. He would
    take his clients to lunch or dinner, and tell them a long, happy tail about an
    old client of his firm who had simply put away a modest amount in a company they
    recommended for over 20 years, and by the time she retired, she had tens of millions
    of dollars and spent most of her time on charity. This fantasy was very appealing
    because it really happened, as Home Depot was one of those stocks that went up
    100 fold over its lifetime. Further, doling out charity is a great way to enjoy
    high status in your golden years without guilt: it''s something the non-rich simply
    can''t do'

  zh: 这让我联想到一个邻居经纪人曾经找我谈过的一次销售宣传。他会带客户去吃午餐或晚餐，并且讲述他公司的旧客户简单地放进了我们推荐的一家公司多年后，退休时已经有数百万美元，而且她的大部分时间都用在了慈善事业上。这个幻想非常吸引人，因为这确实发生过，因为家得宝是那些在其生命周期内涨了100倍的股票之一。此外，施予慈善是一种极好的方式，在晚年享受高地位且无需感到内疚：这是非富人所无法做到的
