    moving average for 15 days. He was curious to see if spending so long on one side
    of a short-term moving average provided any edge. First I’ll show a test based
    on his observation then I’ll give my thoughts on this kind of action.

    it’s 9-day moving average for 15 days in a row, and then holding for “X” number
    of days. The data goes back to 1999.

    is likely close to or at a negative number. On its own, just being above or below
    a moving average for an extended period provides only a small edge.

    and his observation is a keen one. Combine a few small edges and you may end up
    with a substantial one. Some kind of action to trigger an entry when the market
    is in this extended condition could work quite well.
