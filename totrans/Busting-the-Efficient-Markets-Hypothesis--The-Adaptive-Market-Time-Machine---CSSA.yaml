- en: In this series of posts, I will challenge the Efficient Markets Hypothesis with
    the introduction of  a methodology that uses bias-free adaptive learning algorithms.
    I will show that a learning algorithm that is given no prior information or assumptions
    can find profitable patterns in short-term data and handily beat the market with
    less risk. This “Adaptive Market Time Machine” will start off trading the S&P500
    index in 1955 with no other tools than the past sequence of runs over the last
    5 trading days. The time machine is not a black box, it conducts experiments and
    uses basic statistics that any scientist or any well-versed “quant-oriented” trader
    could perform. Further adding to the realism of the experiment is that unlike
    most technical analysis tools today, run data is information that could have been
    realistically been used by a trader back in 1955.

    mediocrity bestowed upon all of us in the investment industry by the academic
    world. It roughly states that no one can be expected to systematically outperform
    the market over time, and those that do are simply lucky. For a modern academic
    review and excellent background on the EMH please read this paper by Andrew Lo:

- en: Traders and portfolio managers often respond that the EMH does not work in practice–they
    have backtested several strategies that have consistently beat the market in the
    long run. The high priests  and founders of the EMH would respond that they are
    simply **data- mining**–that is they are by chance finding the rule or handful
    of rules that worked in the past, but this does not mean that they will work in
    the future. This is a very valid point: how do we know that the process is being
    done in a way that actually generalizes out of sample in real-life? Simple out
    of sample or walk forward testing is not enough– you may validate that a specific
    strategy is robust, but not the process  and method of backtesting as it applies
    to a variety of approaches/indicators. That is, **the research process itself
    must be generalizable**, otherwise you are simply validating that a strong effect
    exists for a given strategy that works in practice. This does not mean that using
    the same method/research process will be able to discover and validate new effects that
    will also work out of sample.

    backtesting was not simply biased towards a specific market climate? When trend-following
    dominates the “best” strategies will be trend oriented, but how do you know when
    they are starting fail? How do you know if the regime is changing?  The only way
    to REALLY know is if you could mimic the process of intelligent and well-thought
    out backtesting and create a machine with 1) no prior knowledge 2) no prior bias
    towards any given strategy. You would then take that machine and let it conduct
    tests and trade through new environments over time. One of the best examples of
    an adaptive process used the strategy of daily-follow through and was first detailed
    by Michael Stokes at MarketSci: [http://marketsci.wordpress.com/2008/11/19/the-simple-made-powerful-with-adaptation/](http://marketsci.wordpress.com/2008/11/19/the-simple-made-powerful-with-adaptation/) The
    best and only academic article of substance on this concept applied to the stock
    market is by a few Canadian professors (probably why its obscure) and I strongly
    recommend that you read it:  [http://docs.google.com/gview?a=v&q=cache:lBeGPkJ5TMMJ:www.fma.org/SLC/Papers/cnPKR161m.pdf+Can+Machine+Learning+Challenge+the+Efficient+Market+Hypothesis%3F&hl=en&gl=ca](http://docs.google.com/gview?a=v&q=cache:lBeGPkJ5TMMJ:www.fma.org/SLC/Papers/cnPKR161m.pdf+Can+Machine+Learning+Challenge+the+Efficient+Market+Hypothesis%3F&hl=en&gl=ca) 
    Having read a great deal, and having tested machine learning and neural networks,
    I can tell you that the adaptive market time machine is completely different.
    The manner in which it makes decisions and the results are intuitive–unlike neural
    networks which find relationships that humans cannot possibly understand. Unlike
    machine-learning, it does not employ sophisticated non-linear regression techniques.
    The technology is most comparable to particle swarm optimization but with distinct
    differences. But at the very root it conducts statistical tests and uses a very
    robust evolving mechanism to figure out what is working and how things are changing.
    More on the time machine in the next article.'

  zh: 还有其他难以看到的陷阱：我们如何确定回测不是简单地偏向于特定的市场环境？当趋势跟随主导“最佳”策略时，将是以趋势为导向，但你怎么知道它们开始失败了？你如何知道体制是否在改变？唯一真正知道的方法是如果你能模仿智能和深思熟虑的回测过程，并创建一台机器，它既不具备先验知识，也不偏向于任何特定的策略。然后，你会带着那台机器在新环境中进行测试和交易。其中最好的自适应过程示例是利用每日跟踪策略，并首次由迈克尔·斯托克斯在MarketSci进行详细介绍：[http://marketsci.wordpress.com/2008/11/19/the-simple-made-powerful-with-adaptation/](http://marketsci.wordpress.com/2008/11/19/the-simple-made-powerful-with-adaptation/)
    对这个概念在股市中的唯一且实质性的学术文章是由一些加拿大教授撰写的（可能是因为其晦涩），我强烈推荐你阅读：[http://docs.google.com/gview?a=v&q=cache:lBeGPkJ5TMMJ:www.fma.org/SLC/Papers/cnPKR161m.pdf+Can+Machine+Learning+Challenge+the+Efficient+Market+Hypothesis%3F&hl=en&gl=ca](http://docs.google.com/gview?a=v&q=cache:lBeGPkJ5TMMJ:www.fma.org/SLC/Papers/cnPKR161m.pdf+Can+Machine+Learning+Challenge+the+Efficient+Market+Hypothesis%3F&hl=en&gl=ca)
    经过了大量阅读，并测试了机器学习和神经网络，我可以告诉你，自适应市场时间机器完全不同。它做出决策的方式和结果是直观的 - 不像神经网络能发现人类不可能理解的关系。与机器学习不同，它不使用复杂的非线性回归技术。这项技术最类似于粒子群优化，但有着明显的差异。但在根本上，它进行统计测试，并利用非常稳健的进化机制来了解什么是有效的，以及事物如何变化。更多关于时间机器的内容将在下一篇文章中详细介绍。
