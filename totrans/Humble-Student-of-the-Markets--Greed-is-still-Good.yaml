    Wall Street would be a little bit contrite and be more careful about what kinds

    don't move much, but today the volatility on many currency pairs is similar to
    the vol levels on equities a year ago. Even at those levels, it is still possible
    to take advantage by using, for example, products that offer a very large range
    around a spot level or that take a view that the spot will not move as much as
    the volatility implies.
