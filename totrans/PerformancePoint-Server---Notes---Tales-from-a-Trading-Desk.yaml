    Server 2007 early last year. PPS 2007 focuses

    One starting place is Norm’s blog that provides details on data integration using
    [SSIS](http://blogs.msdn.com/normbi/archive/2008/04/04/ssis-and-performancepoint-server-data-integration-demo.aspx).
    The PP team [blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/performancepoint/) is definitely another
    place you want to keep an eye on for PP informations. Erika has a [posting](http://blogs.msdn.com/erikaehrli/archive/2007/09/28/performancepoint-server-2007-what-is-it-and-how-can-i-get-started.aspx)
    to get you started. As expected data for PP is held in SQL Server.
