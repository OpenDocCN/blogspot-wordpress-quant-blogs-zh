    hockey masks, where individuals may not want to wear one if no one else is because
    of marginal costs in eyesight, signalling toughness, but if everyone wears one
    they are all likely to have more teeth and functioning neurons.

    Good data tends to be very business-specific, different for credit card portfolios,

    and bank examiners also never mentioned this as a bad thing prior to 2007, one
    shouldn't be optimistic that the current bugaboos will be relevant.

    For example, many have pointed out that leverage for the largest investment banks
    was crazy-high in the last crisis, 25-1 in some cases. True, but they were

    It''s a really weak signal because having 10-1 leverage in some assets is much
    safer than having 30-1 assets in another, and banks know this and game accordingly.'

- en: Another example of regulator focus is VaR, which is applied to a subset of traded
    assets within a bank. I'm a fan of VaR, having set up a VaR for KeyCorp's trading
    operations in the 1990's, and found it immensely useful as a monitor on our positions.
    Yet, for risk capital, or the risk of the bank in total, it was irrelevant. The
    assets relevant to this calculation are usually quite small as a percent of total
    assets (<5%), and often part of market-making operations that generally have pretty
    flat exposure to big factors like interest rates or the S&P500\. Thus, in the
    past crisis the big

    and certify them as our standard bearers. No penalties, just full reviews, with
    their own subjective criteria, which is as well explained and more rational than
    anything coming of the FRB/OCC/OTS/SEC/HUD/FDIC/NCUA/FTC. Sure that would give
    them a lot of power and a huge wealth transfer, but consider the billions spent
    on bank regulation that is so transparently pointless, we could do better for
    one tenth the cost.
