    market leaders are and how the leadership is behaving. Technology had been standouts
    in the past few months. As the chart of the Technology Select SPDR ETF (XLK) relative

    The chart below of the iShare MSCI Emerging Market ETF (EEM) relative to the S&P
    500 shows that it, too, is likely to encounter relative overhead resistance soon.
