- en: In a Traderfeed post on Monday Dr. Brett Steenbarger presented the [concept
    of using the EEM:SPY pair as a sentiment gauge](http://traderfeed.blogspot.com/2010/04/etf-pairs-as-sentiment-gauges-eem-and.html).
    The idea is that when EEM is outperforming SPY, traders are more willing to take
    on risk and stocks as an asset class should benefit. When SPY outperforms EEM,
    then traders are seeking relative safety and the forward outlook for stocks isn’t
    as good.

    that used basically the same risk seeking/aversion idea. [A link to that post
    may be found here](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2009/05/simple-powerful-timing-indicator.html).
    [You may also download the model](http://www.quantifiableedges.com/members/freedownload.php)
    (though you will need to update it with recent prices).

    that model. (*Note: my relative strength calculation, which originally came from
    Gerald Appel’s Book, “Technical Analysis, Power Tools for Active Investors” is
    a bit different than Dr. Steenbarger’s calculation. The model calculation examines
    relative strength over a 10-week period.*) After doing so I noted the following
    observations:'

    in a position about 2/3 of the time.

    little over 35% using the model vs. about 20% with SPY buy and hold.

    buy and hold.

    a gain of about 186%.

- en: In summary, while history is short, Dr. Brett’s EEM:SPY pair seems to work well
    as a sentiment indicator. As we saw with the Nasdaq:S&P model last year, there
    appears to be an advantage not only in entering the market when the riskier index
    is leading, but also in trading the riskier index rather than the SPY.
