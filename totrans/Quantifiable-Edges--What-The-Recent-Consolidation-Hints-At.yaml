     What is interesting though is that it has closed within the range of that 1 bar
    every day for the last week.  The bears failed to follow through on that selloff,
    but the bulls have not managed to move the SPX back out of the range either.  This
    triggered the study below, which I last discussed a couple of years ago.

    and consolidation on a fairly consistent basis.  But the implications are only
    bullish for a few short days.  After that there does not appear to be a decided
    edge for either the bulls or the bears.  I have a bit of a concern, though.  Technically,
    the current setup does qualify.  But the last 5 days have been a fairly nice rally.
     SPX just barely has missed breaking out of the range, and it has not “felt” like
    a 5-day consolidation.  So while the study suggests a likely pop higher in the
    next few days, the likelihood may not be quite as strong as suggested.
