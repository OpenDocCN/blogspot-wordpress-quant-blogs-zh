    is still in a shallow recession, inventory is no longer being accumulated, although
    it is not being disposed of yet. This suggests weakness is not getting worse,
    although the weakness will continue. That, presumably, will include near term
    weakening of employment.

    more mixed since the beginning of August. Temporary staffing has gotten worse.
    Monthly payrolls have been weak for the last two months. At the same time, new
    jobless claims are at historic lows. Typically hiring slows down or stops before
    layoffs increase, and it seems that's where we are. So I expect the weakness in
    employment to continue and maybe intensify until the inventory correction is worked

    recoveries), commodity prices suffered a severe decline “during an ongoing economic
    recovery. In each of these cases, the economic recovery persisted well beyond
    the bottom in commodity prices. Indeed, in the past, once commodity prices bottomed,
    the pace of economic growth accelerated and the recovery did not end until commodity
    prices had substantially recovered. For example, in the late-1970s recovery, commodity
    prices bottomed in July 1977 and the recovery did not end until January 1980\.
    Similarly, commodity prices bottomed in July 1986 but the economic recovery continued
    until July 1990\. Finally, commodity prices bottomed in early 1999 but the recovery
    did not peak until March 2001\. As shown, a significant decline in commodity prices
    usually points to stronger rather than weaker future economic growth. Moreover,
    once commodity prices do finally bottom, they have typically risen throughout
    the balance of the economic recovery.
