## Agile IT Organization Design – Part 2

The Construx Executive [Summit](http://www.construx.com/Thought_Leadership/Events/Software_Executive_Summit/?id=16269) and the last book, [Agile IT Organization Design](http://info.thoughtworks.com/download-agile-it-organization-design.html), leads nicely onto another [book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Work-Rules-Insights-Inside-Transform/dp/1455554790), “Work Rules!: Insights from Inside Google That Will Transform How You Live and Lead”.  If you do nothing more than read the inside cover of this book, your get a good number of the lessons:

1.  Take away managers’ power over employees
2.  Learn from your best employees  – and the worst
3.  Hire only people who are smarter than you are, no matter how long it takes to find them
4.  Don’t trust your gut: Use data to predict and shape the future
5.  Default to open – be transparent and welcome feedback

The full list is already in note form in the book.  Just jump to page 367 🙂 – and the topic of Chapter 14, page 336

Of further noteworthy:

*   Page 154 – Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) – Performance management.  How many times have you seen meaningless performance goals?
*   Page 174 – Calibration  process for finalize ratings
*   Page 195 – 8 Project Oxygen Attributes.  Interesting, number 1 on the list is be a good coach (think agile coach).  Maybe a few more managers should follow the 8 [attributes](https://rapidbi.com/google-project-oxygen-8-point-plan-to-help-managers/#.VksU-xA1-EI)
*   Page 295 – Noogler checklist
