    dark side of peddling volatility trading systems, but I do feel like it is past
    time for me to highlight a blog dedicated to posting up-to-the minute information
    on large options trades of interest:  [Options Doggy](http://optionsdoggy.typepad.com/).  This
    blog describes itself succinctly and accurately as “a free posting of notable
    activity in US equity options updated frequently throughout the day.”'

- en: I mention Options Doggy in the context of $800,000 because earlier today, they
    [reported a trade](http://optionsdoggy.typepad.com/options_doggy/2007/07/vix-3.html)
    involving the sale of 20,000 VIX September 25 calls for 0.40.  So it’s not exactly
    $800,000 after commissions, but it’s fairly close.

- en: My first thought was that 0.40 seemed like a fairly good price for that option,
    but now I see that it is currently trading at 0.40-0.45, with the September 30
    calls even fetching 0.15-0.20, so there is more to be had if you want to risk
    some money on the tail of the VIX distribution.

    February 27^(th) or in June 2006?  Not that much, if you think about options being
    tied to futures that are now two months out.  Following February 27^(th), when
    the spot VIX made it briefly as high as 21.25 intra-day, the immediate jump in
    the May futures (two months out) was from 12.6 to 14.2, with these futures never
    rising above 15 during the life of the contract.  Looking back at the June 2006
    VIX spike to 23.81 one sees a similar story: the August futures (two months out)
    trended up from a May 10^(th) low of 12.3 to a mid-June high of 18.7, but never
    even threatened to touch 20.'

- en: So these September 25s are not so much vulnerable to a VIX of 25 as they are
    to a VIX of 30 or so, at least until they get much closer to expiration.  In the
    interim, mean reversion acts as a price cushion of sorts for VIX options and VIX
    futures.  As expiration approaches, however, be wary of the price cushion turning
    into a pin cushion.
