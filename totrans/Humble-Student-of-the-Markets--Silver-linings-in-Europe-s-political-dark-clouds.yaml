    on the rise - and these individuals represent threats to upset the current political
    status quo. After the US election in November, we have to look forward to the
    Italian referendum on December 4, the start of Brexit negotiations in early/mid
    2017, the French election, and the German election. All of these events have the
    potential to tear Europe apart.
