    of the Week: The VIX and Volatility in 2009](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/01/chart-of-week-vix-and-volatility-in.html),
    in which I created a fairly concise annotated summary of the year in VIX and volatility.'

    the volatility triggers were less discrete and seemed to arrive in recurring waves,
    each time apparently posing a different size threat. The [European sovereign debt
    crisis](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/European%20sovereign%20debt%20crisis)
    is a prime example of the waves of threats, as are the concerns about China’s
    ability to navigate the dual hazards of slowing growth and rising inflation. In
    the U.S., concerns about a double-dip recession waxed and waned, while investors
    scratched their heads wondering just how much to worry about the foreclosure crisis
    or events on the Korean peninsula.

    in May and an even bigger [VIX spike](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20spikes)
    (to 48.20) toward the end of the month as the European sovereign debt crisis threatened
    to snowball out of control, pushing the VIX to a higher close than at any point
    prior to the 2008 financial crisis.

    oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, which imparted a sense of helplessness across
    the U.S. and helped to dampen any sort of optimism about the economy and perhaps
    even technological progress in general.

    the year, due in part to a second round of quantitative easing on the part of
    the Fed.

    new daily record volumes in [VIX options](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20options)
    (June 11), [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures)
    (November 16) and the increasingly popular iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures
    ETN, which most investors know by its ticker symbol, [VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX)
    (November 23).

    in 2010, with [VIX-based ETNs](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20ETN),
    making it much easier for retail investors to make direct investments in volatility.
    My guess is that this development is just a beginning and 2011 could mark a watershed
    year in terms of recognizing of volatility as a mainstream asset class.
