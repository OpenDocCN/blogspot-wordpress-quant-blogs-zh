    buying one-month VIX 30-delta calls on a monthly basis. The LOVOL mix of VIX and
    SPX options reduces the chance of shortfalls below -10% but still preserves the
    bulk of market gains. By construction, the LOVOL delivers returns between the
    BXM and VXTH, or a risk profile between a cushion and a tail hedge.

- en: The key seems to be reflected in the following total return chart above, where
    you have the new index in orange, the SPY in white. The low vol index generated
    a lower downturn in the 2008 recession. Alas, these are indices created post-2008,
    so they overstate the benefits (backtest always look better than real-time). Further,
    the benefits are pretty small, just in really big downturns...perhaps.
