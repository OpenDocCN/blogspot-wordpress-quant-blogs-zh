    rates in mid-2015\. But Fed tightening, by itself, will not cause equities to
    tank. That`s because the Fed is tightening in response to a rising growth and
    inflation outlook. Higher growth translate to higher earnings, which should push
    stock prices higher.

    scale, tend to suffer default surges during troughs in the credit cycle. The first
    high-yield default surge occurred from 1989 to 1992, and encompassed the collapse
    of Drexel Burnham Lambert. The second surge ran from 1999 to 2003, following the
    bursting of the dot-com bubble, and the third happened in the midst of the global
    financial crisis, from 2008 to 2009.

    of quantitative easing (QE) and allows interest rates to rise. QE may have ended,
    but Fed guidance calls for interest rates to remain low for a “considerable time.”
    Fridson was asked about QE and the persistence of low rates during Q+A after his
    presentation, and the answer left the audience murmuring.
