    college--about 80%--and yet only 40% of high school graduates go to college. Above

    to college who can and want to, constraints facing households considering investments
    in human capital, or that this reflects compensation for, and responses to, an
    investment opportunity that is lumpy, irreversible, and most crucially, risky.
    That is, it's a risk premium. [The simple idea that this is from increased globalization
    and migration making unskilled labor worth less is not a prominent explanation,
    probably because academics like to assume that in aggregate skill is a function
    of education, a simple choice variable].

    in wealth and income around us. But when you examine it further, it simply acts
    like another free parameter that 'explains' the data via the magic of overfitting.
    Note that schools with the lowest completion rates are

    don't generate a big wage premium, though their risk is huge. Or, if you look
    across majors, and account for the fact that more people 'switch' from hard majors
    like engineering to easy majors like sociology rather than vice versa, this drop-out
    risk also fails to explain the differential major wage premia. Lastly, there's
    PhD programs, where people seem to spend a lot of time for virtually no measurable
    increase in earnings compared to getting a Master's degree (see Economist article

    have to explain at least 'most' of the conspicous data points it was not designed
    to explain. In this case, adding a risk premium can explain the 'puzzling' college
    wage premium, but does not generalize across colleges, within colleges, or across
    degrees (BA, MA, PhD). The 'risk premium' explanation is
