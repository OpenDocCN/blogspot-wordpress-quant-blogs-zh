- en: We think that generations move history along and prevent society from suffering
    too long under the excesses of any particular generation. People often assume
    that every new generation will be a linear extension of the last one. You know,
    that after Generation X comes Generation Y. They might further expect Generation
    Y to be like Gen X on steroids – even more willing to take risk and with even
    more edginess in the culture. Yet the Millennial Generation that followed Gen
    X is not like that at all. In fact, no generation is like the generation that
    immediately precedes it.

    the excesses and mistakes of the midlife generation that is in charge when they
    come of age. This is necessary, because if generations kept on going in the same
    direction as their predecessors, civilization would have gone off a cliff thousands
    of years ago.

    is undergoing a generational shift. To demonstrate his point, he goes back into
    American history and shows examples such as the generational shift between the
    leadership of Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses S. Grant. He goes on to postulate what
    that may mean for American society and, by extension, the investment implications
    of that shift.

    is real, and not primarily due to changes in the ethnic mix of the college-aged
    population or to the types of post-secondary institutions they attend, the authors
    assert. ***The female share of college students has expanded in all 17 member-nations

    United States is about to undergo a demographic shift away from a white population

    you go to university](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/if-youre-a-new-canadian-you-go-to-university/article1321201/).

    If not, what is it that makes the American experience so unique that this form
