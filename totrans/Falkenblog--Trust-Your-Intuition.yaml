    it is interesting that throughout history leaders unsure of the grounds of their
    actions have found reticence appealing. As Lord Mansfield, an 18th century English
    judge, advised a newly appointed colonial governor:'

- en: I find this a very wise course of action for leaders, because the last thing
    they want to do is get mired in a debate where their opinion is analyzed just
    like any other. Best to let the subordinates make their case, hope for the best,
    and move on. Groups need people in key positions to make final decisions, even
    if flawed, and while they should be held accountable, that should be done at a
    meta level, not at every step in a decision making process. Thus with hindsight
    I now appreciate the wisdom of some very wealthy leaders I have worked with who
    would say little, if only on this tactical point.

  zh: 我觉得这是对领导者非常明智的行动，因为他们最不希望的是被卷入一个辩论中，在那里他们的观点会像其他任何观点一样被分析。最好让下属陈述自己的案例，希望一切顺利，然后继续前进。团体需要关键职位上的人做出最终决定，即使有缺陷，而且尽管他们应该对决策过程中的每一步都要负责任，这种责任应该是以元级别来进行，而不是在每一步决策过程中进行。因此，回想起来，我现在欣赏曾经和我合作过的一些非常富有的领导者的智慧，他们在这个战术性观点上只会说很少话。
- en: Another interesting point brought out by this line of reasoning is that judgement
    has a higher chance of being correct than the reasoning. I find this true too,
    as Hayek noted many traditions, ethics and mores come down to us proven by their
    fruitfulness to believers. So, the institutions of freedom were not established
    because lawmakers foresaw the benefits they would bring, that would come later,
    when Smith noted the nonintuitive connection between selfish and collective interest,
    and when Hayek outlined the importance of decentralized incentives. Hayek wrote
    a lot about how much of what we know that is useful is impossible to articulate.
    It's provisional knowledge to be sure, but proven via its pragmatic value as opposed
    to rhetoric. Indeed, rhetoricians are often quite good at debating any side of
    an issue, often choosing what is most likely to be favored, highlighting this
    skill is not so useful in finding the truth as it is in persuading others one
    should be a leader (at which point, one should then become reticent, see above).

  zh: 这种推理方式引出的另一个有趣的观点是，判断的正确性的概率高于推理。我也发现这是真的，正如哈耶克所指出的，许多传统、伦理和习俗都经由信徒证明其有效。因此，自由的制度并非是因为立法者预见到了它们会带来的好处而建立的，那是后来的事，当史密斯指出了自私和集体利益之间的非直观联系以及哈耶克勾勒出了分散激励的重要性的时候，这些才会出现。哈耶克写了很多关于我们知道的很多有用的东西是无法表述的。这当然是有条件的知识，但它是通过其实用价值而非修辞获得的。实际上，修辞学者通常很擅长辩论某个问题的各方面，经常选择最有可能被赞同的观点，强调这种技能在寻找真相方面并不那么有用，而在说服他人应当成为领袖方面就有用了（在这个时候，一个人应该变得沉默，见上文）。
