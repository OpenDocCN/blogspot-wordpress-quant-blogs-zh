- en: The ominously named Hindenburg Omen was developed by Jim Miekka to spot major
    stock market tops. Unfortunately, it has also had a history of crying wolf too
    many times with false positives. Its inconsistency prompted one commentary to
    call it a warning to avoid traveling by blimp.

    signals within a 30-day window to actually register a valid bearish indication."

- en: A chart of the Hindenburg Omen is shown below. The indicator is displayed in
    the lower panel and a valid signal has a value of 3\. History shows that there
    were 11 such warnings in the last 10 years. Six saw declines (shown in pink).
    The market continued to advance or the Omen was too late in warning of declines
    in four instances (grey). One resolved in a sideways choppy market (grey/pink).
    While these results are marginally useful, this indicator's sell signals don't
    inspire a high level of confidence.
