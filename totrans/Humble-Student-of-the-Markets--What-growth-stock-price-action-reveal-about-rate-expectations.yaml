- en: Instead of worrying about whether it can rally through resistance, here is another
    index that staged a cup and handle breakout, but to all-time-highs. It’s the NYSE
    FANG Plus Index, which represents megacap growth stocks, which has been the market
    leadership. The catch is its relative strength is faltering and its retreated
    to test a key relative resistance turned support level. Further relative weakness
    could signal a loss of megacap growth leadership.
