    showed that currently equities are trading well below the 7% trendline and concluded
    that stocks are cheap.

    Augustus Caesar (give or take 2,000 years ago) and put it into equities or an
    equivalent investment? At 7% a year, the value of your family’s $100 original
    investment would now have 60 zeros behind it. Your family could finance TARP and
    the bailout by the world’s central banks from the chump change derived one day’s
    interest.

    destruction. Going back 100 years, people mainly invested in bonds and equities
    did not represent a liquid asset class. Supposing we were to look at the bond
    markets 100 years ago, the “developed” market consisted of Britain, France and
    Germany. The “emerging” markets were America, Argentina, Canada and Russia. (Please
    forgive me if I have forgotten a market or two.)

    markets (US and UK) would have missed a number of markets that tanked horribly
    during that 100 year investment interval. Any care for some Argentinean railway
    bonds from 100 years ago? Russian ones? How about some “safer” German bonds? After
    all, it was a developed market - which subsequently went through one world war,
    subsequent hyperinflation and then the physical devastation of its infrastructure
    after another world war.

    to be worried about the macro risk of a sea change that may devastate their wealth
    just as some of the events in the past hundred years have destroyed wealth. Were
    it not for those very real concerns, equity prices would probably be a lot higher
    than they are today.
