# Humble Student of the Markets: Was the Grinch in the house?

**Mid-week market update**

: I am publishing this note one day early ahead of my holiday hiatus. Regular service will return Sunday with a trading note.

In the Dr. Seuss children's story, "How the Grinch Stole Christmas", the Grinch is a grouchy character who conspired to steal all the Christmas presents from the nearby village. He later has a change of heart and returns all the gifts and participates in the villagers' Christmas celebrations. 

Was the Grinch in the house? It certainly seemed that wau. The Grinch arrived last week in the form of a market pullback accompanied by weak breadth and negative momentum, capped by Omicron shutdown fears and disappointment over delays of Biden's Build Back Better fiscal stimulus program.

Even though the Grinch has stolen the presents, we may be nearing the end of the story. The market printed a Turnaround Tuesday and the S&P 500 regained its 50 dma.
