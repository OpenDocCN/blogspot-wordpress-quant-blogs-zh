    at the end of every month. The latter point is important because clearly he did
    not have the positions on, and because he didn't show up as an owner of many stocks
    through standard reports that show end-of-quarter stockholdings, he needed a story,
    and for some reason people believed he had good reason to be flat at the end of
    the month. But all this volume, on options, makes it very hard to make money because
    you often pay 10 cents each way to the market makers in liquid options. But he
    made basically 1% a month for years with only a few down months with $17B.

    number of trades that if he did this for all his accounts, he would need to have
    more options than currently are the open interest at the CBOE by a factor of 10!
    Something is clearly wrong with that business model, because you just apply the
    logic applied to your account to what you think Madoff is managing, and the implications
    become implausible quite clearly.

  zh: 一份报表表明，对于一个账户有$500k，他进行了足够多的交易，如果他对他所有的账户都这样做了，他需要的期权数量要比芝加哥期权交易所当前持仓量多出一个数量级！这个业务模式显然有问题，因为你只需将你的账户的逻辑应用于你认为马多夫正在管理的业务，其中的含义显然变得不太可能。
