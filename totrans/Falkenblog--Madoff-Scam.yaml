    at the end of every month. The latter point is important because clearly he did
    not have the positions on, and because he didn't show up as an owner of many stocks
    through standard reports that show end-of-quarter stockholdings, he needed a story,
    and for some reason people believed he had good reason to be flat at the end of
    the month. But all this volume, on options, makes it very hard to make money because
    you often pay 10 cents each way to the market makers in liquid options. But he
    made basically 1% a month for years with only a few down months with $17B.

    number of trades that if he did this for all his accounts, he would need to have
    more options than currently are the open interest at the CBOE by a factor of 10!
    Something is clearly wrong with that business model, because you just apply the
    logic applied to your account to what you think Madoff is managing, and the implications
    become implausible quite clearly.

    this. But Tremont’s Rye Investment Management unit had $3.1 billion, virtually
    all the money the group managed, allocated to Madoff. Walter Noel’s Fairfield
    Greenwich Group had $7.5 billion out of its $14.1 billion in total assets invested
    with the manager. All together funds of funds had at least $20.3 billion invested
    with Madoff, who charged

    trading the stocks in the accounts! Thus, they were allocating money to a guy
    whose purported business model exceeded any back-of-the-envelope calculation of
    plausibility, and it also made no sense for Madoff to be charging zero fees and
    making it up on commissions. If you have a 4 Sharpe investment strategy, you would
    make your profits off the investment fees, not commissions.'

    stocks with no risk, or 100 basis points on a Treasury Bond arbitrage trade. There
    just is not that kind of edge in these markets, unless you are taking gobs of
    risk. As he suggested he had no risk, the

    likely they assumed Bernie's business model was a ruse, he was cheating through
    insider trading or front-running and they wanted in no questions asked. The problem
    with a Ponzi scheme is they are doomed to end in disaster. I don't know why people
    do them, because I simply couldn't enjoy myself knowing all these people I was
    scamming, who were my friends, would soon hate my guts.
