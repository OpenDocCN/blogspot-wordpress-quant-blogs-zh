- en: This week’s [chart of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week)
    is a little different than some of its predecessors. The chart below is a weekly
    chart that tracks the percentage of stocks currently trading above their 50 day
    simple moving averages. The data are available going back to 2002 and show the
    only other time that the percentage climbed above 90 was in 2003, as the markets
    were rallying off of the 2002-03 bottoms.

    top out in the 75-85 range and then correct, with corrections that stay above
    20-25 representing excellent buying opportunities. On the other hand, corrections
    that dip below the 20-25 range run a much higher risk of turning into longer-term
    bear trends.

- en: At a current level of 90.03% above the 50 day SMA, the two month rally has to
    be considered extended, but not necessarily without any additional headroom. Given
    the magnitude of the 2007-09 drop, such bullish extremes on a subsequent bounce
    should not come as a surprise, but they should cause the bulls to be a little
    more cautious.
