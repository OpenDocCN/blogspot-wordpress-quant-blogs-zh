    in individual securities such as [FAS](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/FAS),
    [IOC](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/IOC), [EWZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EWZ)

    however, it may be time to reconsider just how extreme implied volatility can
    get. Vivus has a new weight-loss pill, Qnexa, that is under review by the FDA,
    with an FDA panel decision expected Thursday. For those who are interested in
    the details, Business Week provides a handy summary of the situation in [Vivus’s
    Diet Pill Qnexa Faces FDA Scrutiny on Safety](http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-07-13/vivus-s-diet-pill-qnexa-faces-fda-scrutiny-on-safety.html).

    of the news on the various Vivus options and their implied volatility.

    right now. This is a lottery ticket – and an expensive one. Not a place for ‘risk
    capital’ in my book, but perhaps an appropriate use of ‘entertainment capital’
    if anyone one has some of that sitting around.
