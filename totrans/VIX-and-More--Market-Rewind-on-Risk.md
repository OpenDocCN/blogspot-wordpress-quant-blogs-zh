# VIX and More: Market Rewind on Risk

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/01/market-rewind-on-risk.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/01/market-rewind-on-risk.html#0001-01-01)

Since Joe Nocera, Michael Lewis and David Einhorn all had a chance to talk about [risk](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/risk) in yesterday’s [Required Reading](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/01/required-reading-joe-noceras-risk.html) segment, I thought it was timely of Jeff Pietsch at [Market Rewind](http://marketrewind.blogspot.com/) to pick this morning to offer up some of his thoughts on the subject of risk.

In [ETF Risk in Review](http://marketrewind.blogspot.com/2009/01/2008-risk-in-review.html), Pietsch draws on data from his [ETF Rewind](http://www.etfrewind.blogspot.com/) tool to tackle the subject of risk-adjusted performance and ranks the 2008 performance of various ETFs within their grouping according to a [Sortino Ratio](http://www.sharpeinvesting.com/2007/06/sortino-ratio.html) (similar to the more familiar [Sharpe Ratio](http://www.stanford.edu/%7Ewfsharpe/art/sr/sr.htm), but the Sortino Ratio not penalize performance for upside volatility.) Not surprisingly, consumer staples ([XLP](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLP)) and health care ([XLV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLV)) turn in the some of the best risk-adjusted performance numbers for 2008, while financials ([XLF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLF)), emerging markets ([EEM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EEM)) and real estate ([IYR](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/IYR)) are notable laggards.

One key take away from the analysis is the value of thinking of ETFs in terms of miniature portfolios whose performance can be evaluated on a risk-adjusted basis. We witnessed history in 2008 and as painful as some of that history may have been to live through, hopefully we all enter 2009 with the benefit of a healthier and more sophisticated perspective on volatility and risk.
