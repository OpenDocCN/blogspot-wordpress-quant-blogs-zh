    to be a lot in terms of revenue increases or expenditure cuts in the pipeline.

- en: So, what's going to cause this trend to reverse course in a few months?  Two
    things. First, the Federal deficit is projected to basically halve every year
    for the next couple, getting to around zero in 5 years. As mentioned above, the
    profiles in courage recently displayed should give one pause, especially considering
    how a newly elected Democrat couldn't even cut the defense budget meaningfully.
     Secondly, growth over the next 5 years will average 3.2% annually.

     It's an outlier. How can they get away with that? Well, they put in a recession
    next year, so that would seem to suggest they are being pessimistic, but then
    this is countered by years of 4+ growth.

    honest to simply have a vector autoregression that projected a slow reversion
    to the long run trend, and leave it at that. Instead, using the illusion of control
    that comes out of their structural model, the CBO thinks they have not merely
    the mean, but the fluctuations tied down. Heck, last time we were

    clue we were actually in a downturn.  So, this recession in some sense will be
    unique like all the past ones, the exception being that it will be the one we
    actually saw coming (and was mild).

    like that, if it comes in worse than expected you simply move out the recovery
    over time and it looks like you saw it all coming (first rule of forecasting:
    do it early and often). If growth comes in better than expected next year you
    highlight how pessimistic you are (leaving those 4% growth years for someone else
    to explain, not that anyone gets called on projections out over 2 years anyway).'

    people prefer to hear a 20% chance of rain to a 5% prediction, even if the latter
    is more calibrated.  Thus, small probabilities for precipitation are over estimated
    in general. But the CBO is relied upon to make big decisions and not selling advertising,
    and they clearly are simply pulling numbers out of the air when they 1) forecast
    recessions and 2) forecast 5 years of above-average growth.'

    biased forecast is for managing ex-post rationalizations in real time. The first
    key to being a good quant is honesty, because when you start lying to others,
    you start lying to yourself, and then you are simply an articulate confabulating
    hack for whatever prejudice is driving your big picture.
