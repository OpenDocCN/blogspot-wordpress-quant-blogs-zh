    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading
    "buy" signal. The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of
    the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. Past trading of
    the trading model has shown turnover rates of about 200% per month.

    bullish on stocks for all of 2016\. This may be the time to sound a cautionary

    cycle. The black line shows the pattern based on past monthly median returns and
    the blue line shows the pattern based on average monthly returns. Statistically,
    median returns (black line) are better representations than average returns (blue
    line) because averages can be distorted by large outliers, such as the Crash of
    2008.
