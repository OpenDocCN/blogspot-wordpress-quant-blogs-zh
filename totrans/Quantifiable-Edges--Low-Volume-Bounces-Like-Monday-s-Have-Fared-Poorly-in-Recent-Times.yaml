- en: Monday's bounce in reaction to Friday's drop came on the lowest NYSE volume
    in a week. Below I have listed all instances since 2002 where the market has dropped

- en: This would seem to suggest a downside edge for Tuesday. One caveat though is
    that prior to 2002 this downside edge was not evident. Another issue is that today's
