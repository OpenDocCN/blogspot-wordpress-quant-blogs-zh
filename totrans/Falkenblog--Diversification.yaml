    a portfolio given various correlation assumptions, and also the number of assets.
    So I took two portfolio of the S&P500 in two very different years: 2008 and 2017\.
    The VIX had one of its highest average levels in 2008, at 31.5, while its lowest
    in 2017, at 11.0.  Because I''m interested in low vol portfolios, I took the stocks
    with below-average volatility from the prior year.  The statistics on these 250
    stocks were as follows:'

- en: Both total volatility and correlation were about 3 times higher in the crisis
    year of 2008\. This is because the total market volatility was so much higher.
    One could say correlations rise in bad times, but one could also say that mathematically,
    given a 'one-factor' model (the market), if the market has higher volatility its
    assets will have a higher correlation.

    off the diagonal. Volatility and correlation are taken from the same period here,
    that in the years 2008 and 2017.

    with 90% of it coming after n=15\. Given many people look at multiple factors,
    not just the market factor, this could make this formula less relevant. So I took
    all those 250 stocks and created thousands random of sub-portfolios to get an
    estimate of the actual, or empirical, volatility.

    basically identical. You only see two lines because there are two sets of lines
    that overlap. In both scenarios, the 10 asset portfolio had insignificantly higher
    volatility than the 250 asset portfolio. While the correlations are quite different,
    generating different levels of diversification as a function of the number of
    assets, they both almost perfectly matched the simple formula.'
