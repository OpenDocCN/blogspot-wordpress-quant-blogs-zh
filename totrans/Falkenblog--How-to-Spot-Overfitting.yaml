    data. The problem is that it is too tempting to look at some data, keep applying
    different inputs and functional forms, until you fit the data. In some sense,
    that's what a good model does, so the objective, maximizing the R2, is encouraged.

    really knows if they overfit the problem, because outsiders don't know how the
    ultimate functional form was chosen (iterating over a large set of inputs?). Macro
    forecasting is especially difficult, and anyone familiar with its history would
    do well to be modest (see

    so the average forecast should be around 16%, not jumping from 0 to 100%. A forecast
    should cluster around the unconditional expectation, not the extremes. Only with
    hindsight do these kind of forecasts make sense.
