- en: confirms my personal experience that value investing is in a sea of pain at
    the moment. The reasons are quite different from the last time (during the dotcom
    era) when value investing was in the doldrums. This time around, people are not
    full of euphoria about the prospects of growth stocks -- they are just getting
    increasingly gloomy of value stocks which seem to be getting cheaper by the minute.
