    Central European Time to Eastern Time (or Central Time if you are an options trader)
    and pay more attention to what is going on inside the borders of that sometimes
    overlooked nation just south of Canada.

    investors will be whether the relatively robust economic performance (at least
    by current global standards) will be able to continue. Earlier this week, in [Global
    Manufacturing Recession or Noise?](http://econompicdata.blogspot.com/2011/12/global-manufacturing-recession.html)
    EconomPic raised the question of whether the U.S. and a handful of emerging market
    economies would be able to lift the global economy up or whether Europe and the
    Pacific Rim nations would end up dragging down those few economies that are currently
    thriving.

    the answers are most likely to come out of U.S. economic performance relative
    to expectations, which I have been tracking in some detail for the past two years.
    The graphic below shows how the United States has been faring relative to expectations
    in five groups (manufacturing/general, housing/construction, employment, consumer
    and prices/inflation) since the beginning of 2010.

    during the past 2-4 months. Should these trends continue, it bodes well for global
    activity and for stock prices as well – especially if the European disaster discount
    can be marked down.
