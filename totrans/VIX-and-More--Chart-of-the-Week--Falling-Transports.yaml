- en: For the most part, last week saw some mild negative numbers in most of the major
    market indices. One particular index that is closely watched by many, however,
    was particularly hard hit. The [Dow Jones Transportation Average](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Transportation_Average)
    ([DJTA](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/DJTA)), an essential component
    of [Dow Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Theory), fell 5.4% for the week
    and was particularly hard hit on Friday.

    earnings and while the bottom line numbers were impressive, investors were spooked
    by substantial revenue declines. Burlington Northern Santa Fe ([BNI](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/BNI))
    reported a quarterly revenue decline of 27% from the comparable quarter in 2008,
    while Union Pacific ([UNP](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/UNP)) reported
    a 24% drop in revenues for the same period. The weak revenue picture helped to
    push the DJTA to a loss of 3.5% on Friday and create what looks for now to be
    a provisional double top in the index in the [chart of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week)
    below.

    are important to watch, particularly when they signal a different economic client
    than is being reported by the manufacturing sector. The transports will be an
    important sector to watch going forward.
