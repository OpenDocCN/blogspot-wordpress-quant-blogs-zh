- en: Periodically, I get a question about where to find VIX futures data.  A few
    brokers ([optionsXpress](http://www.optionsxpress.com/) is one) have this information
    available via their web site and/or trading platform.  The CBOE also provides
    VIX futures data at no charge through the [CBOE Futures Exchange (CFE)](http://cfe.cboe.com/data/CFEMktStat.aspx).  Follow
    the link provided and click on the “Price and Volume Detail” tab to get information
    on all the VIX futures contracts for the previous trading day.  The CFE also has
    a [Historical Market Data](http://cfe.cboe.com/Data/historicaldata.aspx) page
    for those who are interested in detailed historical statistics.

- en: I have clipped a snapshot of yesterday’s closing data to give a sense of what
    information is available.  Note that most of the action is in the front three
    months, yesterdays futures were pricing in an 0.94 gain (a 17.06 futures settlement
    price vs. a 16.12 close in the VIX cash price) in the VIX over the next five days
    (October contracts expire a week from today), and volatility expectations from
    November 2007 to August 2008 are fairly uniform and muted.

    compare a snapshot of VIX futures then with the current picture.
