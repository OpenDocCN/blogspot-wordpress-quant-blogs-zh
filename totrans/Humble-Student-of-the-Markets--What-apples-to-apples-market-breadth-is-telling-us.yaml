- en: In light of the recent weakness of the DJ Transports, there has been a greater
    focus on the idea of market breadth and what it tells us. I have heard a lot about
    how the Transports don`t represent the US economy or market in the same way when
    Charles Dow first devised the Dow Theory. When you boil it all down, the divergence
    between the DJIA and DJTA represents a form of breadth divergence.

    army is advancing, you want to know if only the generals are leading the charge
    or if the whole army is moving forward. In market terms, the generals represent
    the heavyweights of the market, while the army represent the broader market. A
    market rally on positive breadth is said to be supported by the broad market.
    By contrast, a rally on narrow breadth is led only by the leadership of the heavyweights
    and such advances are interpreted with greater skepticism.

    Line or NYSE Composite. In more modern times, one problem with this approach is
    that the underlying components of NYSE-listed stocks do not include the more growth
    oriented NASDAQ stocks. In addition, the NYSE Composite has a number of closed-end
    funds and REITs which may not be representative of the broad market (aka the army).

    the SPX. These measures do not suffer from the shortfalls of the NYSE A-D Line
    or NYSE Composite because they measure the breadth of the same stock universe.

    advancing will have the same impact on the A-D Line regardless of whether the
    magnitude of the advance is 0.1% or 10%. By contrast, a 0.1% advance in a stock
    will affect the Equal-weighted SP 500 differently than a 10% advance. The difference
    between the equal-weighted and float-weighted SP 500 is that the movements in
    heavyweights such as AAPL will affect the float-weighted index far more than the
    smallest stocks in the index.

    Equal-weighted SP 500\. In order to graphically exaggerate divergences, I have
    graphed the ratios of the A-D Line to the SP 500 (in green) and Equal-weighted
    SP 500 to the float weighted SP 500 (in red).

    of the indices to the SPX. As the correlation analysis shows, the A-D Line ratio
    is highly correlated to the SPX, which makes spotting divergences difficult. The
    correlation of the returns of the equal to float weighted ratio is relatively
    high and positive, but fluctuates. This makes the task of spotting divergences
    a little easier.

    over the last 10 years. They were able to give early warnings of a negative divergence
    ahead of the market top in 2007; they confirmed the powerful rebound at the bottom
    in 2009; and gave early warnings of market weakness and subsequent rally in 2012\.
    No indicators are perfect, however. The equal-float weighted ratio gave a false
    signal and turned bullish prematurely in 2008 and it was unable to spot the market
    rally in 2011.

    divergences. The equal-float weighted ratio has been falling while the stock market
    has rallied in the last two months. During the same period, the A-D Line ratio
    has been flat, which is another sign of the lack of broad market participation
    in the current rally. In addition, the bottom panel shows a negative divergence

    while the DJTA weakened. Its breach of a technically important support zone is
    further confirmation of the divergence. These conditions set up a Dow Theory non-confirmation
    of the new highs in the DJIA.
