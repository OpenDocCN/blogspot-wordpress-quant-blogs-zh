- en: '**[The All-Weather Portfolio](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2012/11/07/the-all-weather-portfolio-derivation/
    "The “All-Weather” Portfolio Derivation")** was designed by **Ray Dalio** (and
    clearly influenced by **Harry Browne** of the **[Permanent Portfolio](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2012/11/01/permanent-portfolio-derivation-and-historical-performance/
    "Permanent Portfolio Derivation and Historical Performance")**) as a robust static
    allocation that can be used by investors to deliver consistent performance over
    time. The logic of the portfolio construction is to be neutral to risk/uncertainty
    with respect to inflation or economic growth–the two primary factors considered
    to explain all asset returns.  The allocations are a function of the long-term
    expected sensitivity of each asset to the change in these factors- based on whether
    they are rising or falling substantially in relation to historical norms.'

    a very good long-term track record to back up the story. The more interesting
    question is whether a dynamic risk allocation can outperform using the static
    method. Theoretically, risk inputs- especially standard deviations- should be
    easy to model in a dynamic context since they are fairly predictable. Furthermore,
    we do not necessarily need to pre-specify the relationships between assets because
    we can observe their changing relationships via [clustering](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2013/01/10/a-visual-of-current-major-market-clusters/
    "A Visual of Current Major Market Clusters"). Since the All-Weather approach has
    often been considered interchangeable with [Risk Parity](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2012/07/19/not-equal-a-comparison-of-risk-parity-and-equal-risk-contribution/
    "Not Equal: A Comparison of “Risk Parity” and “Equal Risk Contribution”"), it
    is interesting to see if the purely mechanical and dynamic approaches to risk
    parity perform in comparison using the same assets. **Michael Kapler** of [Systematic
    Investor](http://systematicinvestor.wordpress.com/), ran the following tests in
    R using different risk parity variants. We also show for comparison the more sophisticated
    “[Cluster Risk Parity](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2013/01/06/cluster-risk-parity-crp-versus-risk-parity-rp-and-equal-risk-contribution-erc/
    "Cluster Risk Parity (CRP) versus Risk Parity (RP) and Equal Risk Contribution (ERC)")”
    (Kapler, Varadi, 2012) which removes the universe bias from portfolio allocation
    and delivers a more precise risk allocation. The assets used below to represent
    the different asset classes are a combination of funds and ETFs to maximize data

- en: We can see that all dynamic methods perform better than the static method by
    a fairly substantial margin in terms of risk-adjusted returns. This suggests that
    the changing risk and correlations of each asset class already reflect expectations
    for changes in the economic factor risk to both inflation and economic growth.
    Furthermore, these changes can be predicted by looking at recent historical data.
    In addition, we also can see that more complex versions of risk parity (ERC and
    Clustering variants) slightly underperform the simplest version of risk parity
    that ignores the correlations between securities and only uses the risk information.
    This potentially implies either a constant correlation between assets, or that
    the careful choice of these different assets already reflects an embedded static
    clustering method (which would make the correlation information much less useful
    than risk in a dynamic context). Since [previous tests](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2013/01/19/static-versus-dynamic-clustering-on-multiple-asset-classes/
    "Static versus Dynamic Clustering on Multiple Asset Classes") demonstrate the
    superiority of clustering methods (both static and dynamic) to basic risk parity,
    this implies that the universe chosen is a good static clustering approach. In
    conclusion, the results at least suggest that dynamic risk allocation is a valid
    way to create an effective “All-Weather” Portfolio. In practical terms, using
    cluster risk parity with a diverse and large asset pool is the easiest way to
    capture this profile while avoiding a lot of pre-specification.
