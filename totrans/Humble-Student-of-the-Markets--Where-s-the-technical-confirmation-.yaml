    Business Daily written on September 27, 2001, which was shortly after the 9/11
    attack and market selloff (sorry no link). The article details the follow-through
    day pattern popularized by William O''Neill as a way of spotting intermediate

    one. Next, wait two days. The market often needs time to digest its initial gains.
    Make sure the index doesn’t undercut its low. If it does, start counting over
    again.

    when the Dow, Nasdaq or S+P 500 jumps at least 2% on higher volume than the previous
    day. Ideally trade will also exceed its 50-day average. The bigger the price and
    volume moves, the better.

    rally. Follow-throughs after the 10th day become less significant.

    bullish and called this a W-bottom.

    criteria. Here are the charts for the major average ETFs. First, let's look at
    SPY. Day 1 of the rally, according to the above, was August 23\. On August 29
    (day 5), we had a rally of over 2%, but it was not on "higher volume than the
    previous day".

    of a low volume rally on August 29\.

    \ today (Wednesday). As you can see from the RSI chart on top, this market is\
    \ no longer oversold but sport a neutral reading on RSI. Given these non-confirmations,\
    \ I would at least be hesitant to go long here but regard the current \uFEFFlevels\
    \ as an opportunity to lighten positions."
