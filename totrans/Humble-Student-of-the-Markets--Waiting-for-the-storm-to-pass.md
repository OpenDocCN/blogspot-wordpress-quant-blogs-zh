# Humble Student of the Markets: Waiting for the storm to pass

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2016/05/waiting-for-storm-to-pass.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2016/05/waiting-for-storm-to-pass.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models**

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on research outlined in our post

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The

**Trend Model**

is an asset allocation model which applies trend following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or contraction (bearish)?"

My inner trader uses the

**trading component**

of the Trend Model to look for changes in direction of the main Trend Model signal. A bullish Trend Model signal that gets less bullish is a trading "sell" signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend Model signal that gets less bullish is a trading "buy" signal. The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. Past trading of the trading model has shown turnover rates of about 200% per month.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Buy equities*
*   Trend Model signal: Risk-on*
*   Trading model: Bullish*

*The performance chart and model readings have been delayed by a week out of respect to our paying subscribers.* **Update schedule**

: I generally update model readings on my

 on weekends and tweet any changes during the week at @humblestudent. Subscribers will also receive email notices of any changes in my trading portfolio.

**Don****'t panic, i****t's only a correction**

My last blog post created a bit of a stir among readers as I was inundated with questions (see

[Tactically taking profits in the commodity and reflation trade](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/05/11/tactically-taking-profits-in-the-commodity-and-reflation-trade/)

). To reiterate, I made a trading call to get more cautious based on a developing slowdown coming from China, which was signaled by falling commodity and Asian stock prices.

At worst, this growth scare will result in nothing more than a minor US equity correction. The intermediate term outlook remains bullish. How would you feel about equity prices if I told you:

*   Earnings are continuing to recover
*   Fed policy is dovish and equity friendly

Put simply, stock prices depend on two factors. The first is earnings, or the E in the P/E ratio - and earnings are growing. The second is the P/E multiple, which is a function of the outlook for interest rates and future growth, both of which are showing equity friendly tendencies.

Investors just have to wait out the storm.
