- en: Both the Fed and FedEx had messages of recession for the markets. Fed Chair
    Jerome Powell said that the Fed would raise rates until there was clear and convincing
    signs that inflation was headed toward its 2% target, and its projections amounted

    about a slowdown in global shipping volumes and recessionary conditions.

    reflects rising anxiety about possible blow-ups in individual stocks as earnings
    season approaches.
