    through a financial crisis of gargantuan proportions. The fiscal and monetary
    authorities decided to stimulate the economy in response. But stimulate too much
    and you get runaway inflation. Stimulate too little and you will keel over back
    into recession. You just have to get the stimulus just right - and can we count
    on the Fed and the US government to do that in such a fragile environment?
