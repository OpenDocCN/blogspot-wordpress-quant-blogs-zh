    I wonder how many people have [emerging markets](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/emerging%20markets)
    currencies at the top of their list of concerns. I am guessing few are poring
    over the likes of India ([EPI](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EPI)),
    Indonesia ([EIDO](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EIDO)), Brazil ([EWZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EWZ)),
    Turkey ([TUR](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TUR)), South Africa
    ([EZA](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EZA)), Thailand ([THD](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/THD))
    and the Philippines ([EPHE](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EPHE))
    on a daily basis. As a matter of fact, I would bet that very few people even know
    that there is an ETF dedicated to the Philippines.

    movements that are at the heart of the emerging markets problem right now. Of
    course, the issue with currencies is really little more than a downstream effect
    of rising interest rates in the U.S., which is a result of changing expectations
    about the Fed’s quantitative easing (QE) program. Since December 2008, the Fed
    has used a variety of policy instruments to keep interest rates as low as possible
    in the U.S. and has effectively driven capital to emerging markets, where higher-yield
    investments looked more attractive. As QE begins to unwind, the supply of easy
    money in emerging markets has suddenly come to a halt and countries with large
    current account deficits and loans denominated in dollars (which will be repaid
    in a local currency that is rapidly declining in value) are particularly vulnerable.

    in the black line, along with a ratio of the Indian Rupee to the U.S. dollar (ICN:UUP)
    in orange, as well as a ratio of the Brazilian Real to the dollar (BZF:UUP) in
    green. Now these are a roll-your-own ratio of ETFs to ETFs rather than the exact
    currency crosses, but the charts are almost identical (and easily constructed
    at StockCharts.com), while the key takeaways are necessarily the same. Note that
    until May, ICN and BZF relative to the dollar appeared to be more positively correlated
    to U.S. interest rates than negatively correlated. As soon as interest rates began
    to rise at the beginning of May, both ICN and BZF began to rapidly lose ground
    against the dollar and the negative correlation with U.S. interest rates suddenly
    became very strong.

    the course of the last week, while the ICN:UUP ratio continues to deteriorate,
    as there has been little to suggest that the Indian Rupee is stabilizing, even
    as Brazil improves somewhat.
