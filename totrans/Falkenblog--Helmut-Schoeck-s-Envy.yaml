    with the betrayal of the tribe, because it could have only have occurred by leveraging
    evil spirits or stealing from others. A certain degree of rationality, or at least
    a freedom from a magical view of things, is required before the envious man can

    because each man has as little as the next. For primitive egalitarian societies,
    envy is both a cause and an effect. Schoeck notes that such communities tend to
    have no conception of luck, and so see any objective relative prosperity as a
    sign of theft or alignment with evil forces. Schoeck discusses Native American,
    African, and Polynesian tribes, and note the strong social pressure for anyone
    better off to be lavish in hospitality and generous with gifts. He knows that
