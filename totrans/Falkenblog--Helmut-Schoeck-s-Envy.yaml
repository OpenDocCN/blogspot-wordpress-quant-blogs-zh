    highlights a profound aspect of human nature. Envy is of keen interest to me because
    ever since I wrote my dissertation on the low volatility effect back in 1994,
    I have been interested in why. In standard economic theory, individuals are assumed
    to maximize their utility, which is independent of other's wealth. With this assumption,
    you get a risk premium, and it should be ubiquitous. The risk premium is actually
    quite rare, limited to a couple of asset classes (though not within them). For

    of those few vices that is neither an excess or deficit of virtue, in that cowardice
    and recklessness are a deficit and excess of the virtue courage. The literature
    defending the rationality and value of emotions usually excludes envy as irredeemable.

    emotions. A man can be jealous of another man because of their mutual affection
    for a woman, and here the rival is fungible and the beloved is not fungible. In
    envy, it is the other way around, resenting a rival, not because of a specific
    woman, but rather, that he can obtain a woman of that type.

    with whom the subject perceives himself as in competition. We only feel envious
    of our peers, or who we consider being our peers. Thus, we do not envy a world-class
    athlete, in that we know we are simply not in that class of people. In medieval
    times you had peasants, knights, lords, and a king, while in Ancient Greece you
    had slaves, freedmen, metics, and the upper class. Envy was restricted to one's
    class and perhaps those in the class above.

    First, from our competition for parental resources. As the runt of the litter
    gets fewer parental resources, or the weak bird is left to naked fratricide in
    the presence of the mother, all children wish to dominate their parent''s attention
    out of self-preservation. Yet this is the definition of jealousy, in that the
    instinct presupposes a non-fungible desired object: parental attention. Another
    cause mentioned is in keeping society well-functioning. In his view, without envy,
    people with power would be haughty and overbearing. Yet, simple reciprocal altruism
    would seem to be at play, in that a successful alpha baboon realizes that if they

    tribes do not possess a concept of luck. Everything is determined by spirits,
    fortune, or the 'evil eye.' In primitive societies, the success of others is equated
    with the betrayal of the tribe, because it could have only have occurred by leveraging
    evil spirits or stealing from others. A certain degree of rationality, or at least
    a freedom from a magical view of things, is required before the envious man can
    fully realize that the man he envies does not possess something which, but for
    the possessor's existence, he, the envious man, might otherwise have.

    When we focus on life on this Earth, we want status, and what that implies, justification.
    Only a high status can prove, to ourselves and others, that we are good, important,
    and admired. Status, alas, is in fixed supply. While this constraint can be ameliorated
    by the concept of having many status silos--football, math, Fortnight--ultimately

    suffering caused by another implies inferiority, in that the tormentor had the

    on the false premise that once there is justice, there will be nothing left for

    something new to envy. Further, by raising envy to the status of virtue (as righteous
    resentment over injustice), political entrepreneurs are motivated to reveal new
    inequalities that are to blame for people's impotence. Thus we now have the virtue

    compete, resulting in the de-individualization of individuals in the name of equality.
    Simple utilitarianism implies that justice for many is more important than for
    any one person, and so what counts are the superficial categories we consider

    envy that less egalitarian ones. This isn't obvious because their lack of wealth
    seems to imply they are not greedy, and thus, selfish like Westerners, but this
    is just wishful naïve thinking. There is no tribe where social harmony prevails
    because each man has as little as the next. For primitive egalitarian societies,
    envy is both a cause and an effect. Schoeck notes that such communities tend to
    have no conception of luck, and so see any objective relative prosperity as a
    sign of theft or alignment with evil forces. Schoeck discusses Native American,
    African, and Polynesian tribes, and note the strong social pressure for anyone
    better off to be lavish in hospitality and generous with gifts. He knows that
    if he fails in this, 'the voice of envy will speak out in the whispers of witchcraft'
    which would make his life very unpleasant.
