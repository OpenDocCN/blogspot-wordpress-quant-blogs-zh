- en: The recent [Dubai](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Dubai) debt crisis
    has spurred some investors to take some profits, protect their portfolios and
    contemplate both the acknowledged and hidden threats to the global economy. From
    Wednesday’s close to Friday’s intraday low, the S&P 500 index (SPX) only fell
    17 points or 2.4%, hardly the type of selloff that typically strikes fear into
    the hearts of bulls. Fearing that further declines may be in the cards, however,
    investors snapped up puts aggressively, particularly on Monday, when the put buying
    pushed the CBOE equity [put to call](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/put%20to%20call)
    ratio ([CPCE](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/CPCE)) to elevated levels.

- en: In the chart below, I have reproduced the CPCE along with a 10 day exponential
    moving average (dotted blue line) to smooth the data over a two week period. The
    chart shows that since the July leg of the current bull market, significant pullbacks
    in the SPX (solid black line) have been preceded by drops in the 10-day EMA of
    the CPCE below the 0.58 level. In fact, for the last 5 ½ weeks, the 10-day EMA
    has never threatened the 0.58 area and at the current 0.625, the CPCE shows no
    signs of an impending correction.
