    tonight. Foreign markets and U.S. futures have helped to ruin my plans. Will the
    gap down tomorrow morning (should it continue to be in the 4%-5% it looks like
    now) affect my thinking based on last night’s study?'

- en: could really jump by the close tomorrow – I’ll try and update the reading during
    the day and definitely by tomorrow night. Is it possible the market could fall
    another 5%, 10%, 15% before bouncing? Sure. The bounce will be fierce, though,
    and the further we fall before the bounce (and the higher the CBI goes), the more
    fierce it will likely be. Exact timing is difficult, but I still believe aggressive
    traders can begin toe-dipping. I believe a tradeable bounce will occur within
    the next 5-6 days at the most – probably sooner.

    I am currently looking at it as a swing trade and not a long-term buying opportunity.
