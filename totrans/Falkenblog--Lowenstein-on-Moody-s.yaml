    as a ''nonbank lender.''... Moody’s learned that almost half of these borrowers
    — 43 percent — did not provide written verification of their incomes...half of
    the borrowers, however, took out a simultaneous second loan. Most often, their
    two loans added up to all their property''s presumed resale value, which meant
    the borrowers had not a cent of equity.'

    were generally their primary residences, so they thought it was safe. But 43%
    with no income verification? Half the borrowers had no equity in the game? Issued
    by a nonbank lender, meaning, someone without any large franchise value, and so
    he has little too lose when these things tank? That's picture perfect bad underwriting.
    I think the first thing to do isn't to adjust the algorithm, but do drug testing,
    because ignoring these details is like missing a fly ball because you were staring
    at the shiny lights on the ceiling.

    of asset-backed finance for Moody’s, told me. “Our expertise is as statisticians
    on an aggregate basis. We want to know, of 1,000 individuals, based on historical
    performance, what percent will pay their loans?”

    themselves, why should we believe anything coming out of your group? Do you really
    think your statistical algorithms are all that people pay for? It''s the whole,
    final, fat grade, which for Baa and up, is simply supposed to say ''you don''t
    have to reunderwrite this, because its risk is insignificant.'' A partial grade
    is a cop-out, because you can always say, after the fact, that one in a million
    things was off. If for a structured credit, a Moody''s Baa means "this is A rated
    given the unverified and unanalyzed assumptions given to us, so we notched it
    down one grade", I have one word for you: worthless.'

- en: These people, the mortgage recipients, the originators, had no skin in the game,
    and so, clearly had an incentive to take a bet on housing via a lax securitization
    process. When I worked for a bank, one needed 20% down payment to get a mortgage.
    After all, the first rule of banking is to only give loans to people who don't
    need them. This is a common joke, but the plain fact is, you should be reasonably
    sure that nonpayments are implausible, because estimating losses that are significant
    gets you into equity, not debt. The only exception is consumer loans, like credit
    card, and there we have millions of observations, and so one can expect to lose
    5% a year, but with an 18% interest rate, it's tolerable. When you have no money
    in the house, a 10% fall in housing prices implies significant defaults, leading
    to the new territory, as we are finding out. If borrowers had 20% down and income
    verification, there would not be this problem.

    only a year later, 13% of the loans were delinquent. In April 2007, Moody's announced
    it was revising its model used to evaluate subprime mortgages, but the horse was
    out of the barn. As Mark Adelson noted, Moody's statistical approach, applied
    to these very novel underwriting standards, was 'like observing 100 years of weather
    in Antartica to forecast the weather in Hawaii'. If ever the 'ceteris paribus'
    assumption didn't hold, this was it. Whoever led this group at Moody's should
    be fired.

    good grades, especially when issuers shop ratings, looking for a good grader,
    who then gets this business. So one solution is to have investors, not issuers,
    pay. But that would be tough, because there's a free rider problem, in that most
    investors would wait for someone else to pay, and then, because secrets are impossible
    to keep, piggy back on that guy's opinion.

    in these things, give one grade, so people don't needlessly duplicate the same
    function. I don't see how you can get around issuers paying. But it would be useful
    to mandate that all Moody's performance data is warehoused at the government,
    and have someone at the Fed publish the default data for Moody's, S&P, Fitch,
    and the rest. That is, in compensation for being a Nationally Recognized Rating
    agency, a valuable designation given to only a handful of companies, they need
    an objective scorecard that will adversely impact their stock price if they screw
    up. In this case, Moody's ratings on structured finance clearly isn't worth that
    much right now, and they really have to earn that back their credibility in this
    area.

    and this information is too important, and too valuable, to have the agencies
    grade themselves. For example, Joseph Mason of Drexel University finds that CDOs
    defaulted eight times the rate of corporates for Baa ratings--a massive miss.
    Documenting this performance would hold Moody's accountable, as those in charge
    would know that if any group started to wreck the statistical validity of their
    ratings, it would cost them. There residential mortgage mistake is not merely
    a minor mistake, but reflects a profound lack of judgment on something fundamental--incentives.

    monitored it, would have a different set of incentive problems, more intractable.
    There is a huge franchise value to being independent, accurate, analysts of these
    issues, and so I think Moody''s and their competitors will figure this out, but
    if this carrot is not sufficient, I don''t see the next best solution. We don''t
    merely want excess caution, because a rating that is excessively pessimistic is
    just as misinformative as one that is too easy: soon people will dismiss cautions
    because they are perceived, correctly, as too harsh. The worst result would for
    Moody''s, or some new organization, merely make everything be bullet proof to
    get a rating, because then we would have a bunch of AAA rated paper, rated between
    AAA and BB, and this would merely then be noise, constrain credit, and not be
    an equilibrium solution.'
