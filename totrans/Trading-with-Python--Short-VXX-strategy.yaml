- en: Shorting the short-term volatility etn VXX may seem like a great idea when you
    look at the chart from quite a distance. Due to the contango in the volatility
    futures, the etn experiences quite some headwind most of the time and looses a
    little bit its value every day. This happens due to daily rebalancing, for more
    information please look into the prospect.

    look back at the summer of 2011\.  I have been unfortunate (or foolish) enough
    to hold a short VXX position just before the VIX went up. I have almost blown
    my account by then: 80% drawdown in just a couple of days resulting in a threat
    of margin call by my broker. Margin call would mean cashing the loss. This is
    not a situation I''d ever like to be in again. I knew it would not be easy to
    keep head cool at all times, but experiencing the stress and pressure of the situation
    was something different. Luckily I knew how VXX tends to behave, so I did not
    panic, but switched side to XIV to avoid a margin call. The story ends well, 8
    month later  my portfolio was back at strength and I have learned a very valuable
    lesson.'

    futures curve is approximated by the VIX-VXV relationship. We will short VXX when
    VXV has an unusually high premium over VIX.

    But even more important is that the gut-wrenching drawdowns are largely avoided
    by paying attention to the forward futures curve.
