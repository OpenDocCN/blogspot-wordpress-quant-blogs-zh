    is a subject that I spend a lot of time with behind the scenes, yet rarely post
    about on the blog. Part of the reason for my reticence to post on the subject
    is that my own efforts to develop a volatility forecasting model have demonstrated
    that whatever proficiency I am developing seems to be limited to at most a 2-3
    week forecasting period.'

    write about a subject that I have an interest in (which is almost every time something
    appears on their site), I take notice. Today my avian friends are tackling [Forecasting
    S&P 500 Volatility](http://www.condoroptions.com/index.php/volatility/forecasting-sp-500-volatility/),
    using a variety of approaches, including SPX implied volatility, VIX futures and
    a trio of [GARCH(1,1)](http://www.bionicturtle.com/learn/article/garch11/) forecasting
    models. The consensus? None, really. The SPX IV data anticipates the most volatile
    future, while the GARCH(1,1) models see volatility dropping off more rapidly.
    Check out the [full article](http://www.condoroptions.com/index.php/volatility/forecasting-sp-500-volatility/)
    for the details.

    over the course of the next 2-3 weeks.
