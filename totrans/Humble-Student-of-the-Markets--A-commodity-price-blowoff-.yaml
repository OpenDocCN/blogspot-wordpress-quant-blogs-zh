    reversals last week. First of all, I have been watching the Dow Jones Transportation
    Average to see at what point Mr. Market gets spooked by rising oil prices. To
    my surprise, the Transports broke out to new recovery highs despite $110 and later
    a $120 Brent price. When WTI broke above $110 last week, the Transports broke
    down below their upside breakout level, which became a level of support.

    and rising inflationary expectations.

    minor downtrend, has rallied through the downtrend line and appears to be in a
    sideways consolidation pattern.

    which will certainly mean the end of QE2 and no QE3, as well as foreshadowing
    the end of ZIRP and rising rates?

    stocks. stalled out and rolled over weeks (in some cases months) before crude
    topped out at $147 a barrel. I can vividly recall traders aggressively buying
    energy stocks to no avail, as crude mached higher on a daily basis amid CNBC’s
    “Black Gold” banner on the top of the screen, following crude’s tick-by-tick fluctuations.
    Indeed, those traders who bought energy stocks simply because crude was going
    higher were in for a rude awakening over the next few months, especially if they
    did not have the discipline to cut losses.

    mean trouble for the markets. The chart below of the ratio of XLE to oil prices
    show precisely that condition.
