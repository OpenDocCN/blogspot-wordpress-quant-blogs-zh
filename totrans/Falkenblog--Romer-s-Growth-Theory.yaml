    after you apply the model econometrically the problem is not capital or labor,

    to existing phenomena should generalize in unexpected ways. Alas, this is rarely

    are also firms). K=sum(k(i)), reflecting the idea that bigger economies have more
    knowledge, and thus, greater productivity. F is increasing in all its arguments.
    The key technical point he makes is to assume Y is a concave function of k(i)
    and x(i), which is necessary for an equilibrium to exist, yet because F is increasing
    in K, you have increasing returns to scale in aggregate. Thus, a competitive equilibrium
    exists even with increasing returns to scale, because their individual effect
    on total output K is insignificant (otherwise, with increasing returns to scale,
    everyone soon chooses infinity to maximize their production/utility).

    everyone to invest a lot, growth is higher than otherwise. This highlights the
    potential for good institutions to incent greater growth, say by offering more
    secure property rights, or intellectual property laws. Prosperity becomes a coordination
    problem, seemingly soluble by abstruse mathematics.

    to Solow's exogenous treatment. Yet what is Romer's take away, when translated
    into words? First, he repeats again and again that higher productivity leads to
    higher productivity. But that can't be right, in the sense that growth rates of
    developed countries are not increasing over the past 100 years. I think what he
    means is that developed countries keep growing, while undeveloped ones don't,
    due to their 'bad equilibrium'. So we are back to, why does the US have the good
    one and not Haiti?

    more stuff, but stuff differently arranged. He notes there's a machine that using
    carbon, oxygen, hydrogen and a few other atoms that is smaller than a car, renews
    itself, fixes itself, and creates valuable output. What is it? A cow! See, all
    we have to do is arrange atoms into cow-like things, and the future of robot maids,
    jetpacks, and holodecks will finally arrive. I don't see this kind of insight
    rising above the fantasies of your average comic book reader.

    pre-Chinese era, taking Britain's superior laws, customs, and technology. Yet,
    even in the US, things like competition, entry, and exit are heavily legislated
    against by entrenched interests. Sure, Haiti or Paraguay could allow in foreigners
    to set up franchises, but they don't, because that seems to many as exploitation,
    and has the stench of racism. So we are back to the old ideas about international
    trade, the distribution of wealth, and especially the distribution of wealth among
    various ethnicities. A ruling clique would keep their people poor rather than
    turn over, say, Petrobras to Exxon.
