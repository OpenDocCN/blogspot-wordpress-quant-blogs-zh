# Humble Student of the Markets: Looking for froth in the wrong places

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2017/07/looking-for-froth-in-wrong-places.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2017/07/looking-for-froth-in-wrong-places.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models**

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post,

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The

**Trend Model**

is an asset allocation model which applies trend following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or contraction (bearish)?"

My inner trader uses the

**trading component**

of the Trend Model to look for changes in the direction of the main Trend Model signal. A bullish Trend Model signal that gets less bullish is a trading "sell" signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading "buy" signal. The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. Past trading of the trading model has shown turnover rates of about 200% per month.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Buy equities*
*   Trend Model signal: Risk-on*
*   Trading model: Bullish*

**Where's the Bubble?**

Ben Carlson at

[A Wealth of Common Sense](http://awealthofcommonsense.com/2017/07/4-signs-of-a-bubble/)

 recently detailed the four criteria for a market bubble:

> In a recent conversation with Meb Faber, William Bernstein discussed how his criteria for seeing a bubble has more to do with sociological factors than econometric indicators. Here are his four signs of a financial market bubble:
> 
> (1) Everyone around you is talking about stocks (or real estate or whatever the fad asset of the day is). And you should really start worrying when the people talking about getting rich in certain areas of the market don’t have a background in finance.
> 
> (2) When people begin quitting their jobs to day trade or become a mortgage broker.
> 
> (3) When someone exhibits skepticism about the prospects for stocks and people don’t just disagree with them, but they do so vehemently and tell them they’re an idiot for not understanding things.
> 
> (4) When you start to see extreme predictions. The example Bernstein gives is how the best-selling investment book in 1999 was Dow 36,000.
> 
> He said he’s not worried about a bubble at the moment but seeing 3 out of these 4 conditions being met would be a warning sign.

Despite my series on investor sentiment,

), market psychology has not reached the "OMG I have to quit my job/mortgage the house to buy/trade the hot asset of the day". While there are some excesses, such low levels of institutional cash (chart via

[Business Insider](http://e.businessinsider.com/public/10042147)

), the lack of over-the-top froth suggests that the next stock market downturn from a recession may be relatively mild in the manner of a 10-20% decline seen in the 1990 bear market.

While I am somewhat sympathetic to that view, investors who are looking for signs of froth are looking in the wrong places. One of the processes that occur in recessions the correction of excesses in the past expansion. Most of the real excesses are not to be found within US borders, but abroad.
