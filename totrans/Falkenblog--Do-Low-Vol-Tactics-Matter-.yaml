    for some strategies, tactics are unimportant because the algorithm has a 'flat
    maximum', where lots of parameters generate outputs very nearly as good as the
    optimal parameters. Debt models have this characteristic, as a handful of inputs
    generate the optimal metric pretty well with a variety of weightings and transformations.

    first, you take stocks with the lowest variance over the past N days, and form
    a portfolio. That's the route the

    the factor approach, which applies mean-variance optimization to a set of latent
    factors drawn from the cross-section of stocks. Standard constrained-optimization
    algorithms can be applied to this problem. There are other ways, such as how the

    and factor approach using daily data through Feb 2011, and then looked at the
    resulting porfolios over the next year. Each portfolio had about 100 stocks, and
    they overlapped by about 65 stocks. Volatility was reduced by about 45% relative
    to the equal-weighted benchmark that it was drawn from. In contrast, value and
    growth strategies had very different trajectories. This suggests the specific
    algorithm doesn't matter much if you are merely targeting low volatility.
