    25 September. As BA began moving into the $93 range this morning, it seemed to

    been some major restructuring among BA's

    got lifted throughout the day - sometimes in small volume, others in large, as
    evidenced by two major moves during the afternoon seen below. Within 10 minutes,
    there was a move from $94.75 up to $95.70, almost a full point. That was surprising
    enough, considering the relatively flat trading of the prior 3 hours. Again, at
    3:15PM, BA got another shock from some major buyers - again, offers were lifted
    and the market moved from a low of $94.97, to the day's high of $96.27.
