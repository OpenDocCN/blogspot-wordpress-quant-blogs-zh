# Quantifiable Edges: Fed Days on the 1st of the Month

As I mentioned last night, Wednesday is a Fed Day.

[Fed Days have historically had a bullish inclination](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/search/label/Fed%20Study)

. Of course Wednesday is also the first trading day of August. I’ve documented numerous times that since the late 80s the first trading day of the month has had a bullish tendency. So I wondered how the market has performed on days that a Fed Day has coincided with the first trading day of month. There have only been six instances since the late 80s. I've listed them all below.

Early indications suggest a possible upside edge, but really we have too few instances to draw any conclusions without overwhelmingly lopsided results. Still, I thought this was interesting enough to share.
