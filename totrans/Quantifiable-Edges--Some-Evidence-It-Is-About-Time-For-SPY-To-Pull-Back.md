# Quantifiable Edges: Some Evidence It Is About Time For SPY To Pull Back

> 来源：[http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2014/01/some-evidence-it-is-about-time-for-spy.html#0001-01-01](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2014/01/some-evidence-it-is-about-time-for-spy.html#0001-01-01)

SPY has now gone 11 days without closing below its 5ma, and it closed Tuesday at another new high. The study below is one I’ve shown a few times over the years, most recently in October.  It looks at other instances in which SPY has traded above the 5ma for at least 2 weeks and is now closing at a 10-day high. All results are updated.

In the past this setup has commonly been followed by a short-term pullback. The downside edge doesn't last long, though. It seems to pretty much play itself out over the first 2 days.  It is not an overwhelming edge, but it is still worth noting that SPY has been short-term extended for a while and the normal course of action at this point is a little pullback.
