    move has been fairly sizable. It happened during the stock market bubble of the
    late 90′s, but then occurred again just briefly during the 2006-2007 period when
    the valuation broke the 100% range in Q3 2006 and stayed above that range for
    about a year. We all know what followed the 2007 peak in stock prices.

    is the outlook for fund flows. Simply put, stock prices rise when there are more
    buyers than sellers. So what happens when Baby Boomers in retirement or nearing
    retirement withdraw money from stocks? Can their children and grandchildren support
    stock prices at these price and valuation levels?

    bound stock market. Investors should therefore expect that the risk-on/risk-off
