    over the top, but at the beginning of the week I was #1047 and now it seems that
    all there is left for me to do is to have some more fun with the [earnings spike
    potential algorithm](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/earnings%20spike%20potential%20algorithm).'

    contest, I can still stake a claim to the top 7%, but at the rate my portfolio
    is sinking, my ultimate goal may be to try to scramble back into the top 100,000.

    on [OTEX](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=otex&hl=en) turned out to total
    a 3.8% loss.  For today, I listened to the algorithm for a change and hopped aboard
    [LeapFrog Enterprises (LF)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=lf&hl=en).  So
    far this is my best pick of the week…(wait for it)…down a mere 1.6% today.

    that is a good fit for someone who likes to swing for home runs.  I have owned
    it in my real money portfolio for over a year and have traded around it a great
    deal too.  For what it’s worth, I have also owned and traded Flamel since last
    October and still like the prospects for this biotech/drug delivery play.  Once
    again, I’m going to follow the recommendation of the algorithm and go with FLML
    for Monday.
