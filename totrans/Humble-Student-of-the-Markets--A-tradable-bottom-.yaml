    Trend Model flipped from risk-on to risk-off, which is a downgrade, but the trading
    model, or direction of last change, moved to an unconfirmed positive. The obvious
    question is, "If the intermediate term model goes from 'risk-on' to 'risk-off',
    shouldn't the direction of last change be 'negative' instead of positive?"
  prefs: []

    signal flipped from negative early in the week to an unconfirmed positive on Friday.
    These volatile conditions heighten the risk of performance whipsaw. Let me explain
    how the modeling process works.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Trend Model signals are primarily based on the application of a highly systematic
    trend-following model, which uses crossing moving averages, on commodity prices
    and global equity prices. The details are of which moving averages, which commodities
    and indices and their weights are proprietary, but the conclusions are more of
    less the same no matter how you look at the global picture. However, trend-following
    models have two weaknesses (not bugs, but "features"). They tend to be late in
    calling tops and bottoms and, if there is no trend, their signals are subject
    to whipsaw which detract from performance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To address some of these weaknesses, I have relied on a series of sentiment
    based indicators to better time entry and exit points. These sentiment models
    primarily focus on measures of sentiment from option data, largely because the
    option market is reflective of what people are doing with their money rather than
    sentiment surveys where people express opinions which may or may not be acted
    upon. I also cross-check the conclusions from the option data models with overbought-oversold
    indicators. These short-term sentiment based indicators tend to used more for
    risk control purposes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Here is an example of how the two components interact with each other. If the
    trend-following model is flashing a buy signal and the markets are in an uptrend,
    but the sentiment models are showing a crowded long and an extremely overbought
    condition, I would be inclined to either lower my long position, move to cash,
    or perhaps take a very small short position in anticipation of a pullback.
  prefs: []

    decisions, the signals of both of trend-following components and the short-term
    sentiment indicators are systematic, but their interpretation is somewhat discretionary.

    three trading blocs and engines of growth in the world today are the US, Europe
    and China. While US and European equity market indices tell a great deal about
    these economies, the Chinese equity market is far less developed and less liquid
    than any of the major developed market indices. To get a read on China, I rely
    more on commodity prices.

    worst sell-off since the late-May Taper Tantrum of 2013\. Consumer staples are
    the perfect stocks for slow growth and low yields – as they offer consistency
    of earnings regardless of cyclicality and higher than average dividends. In a
    higher-rate, more pro-cyclical environment, they are not so perfect – especially
    given their current high valuation. And so they are under distribution so long
    as economic news – like last week’s record post-crisis ISM report – continue to

    the possibility of faster growth. It’s been a pretty orderly sell-off for the
    $1.6 trillion high yield market, but quite steady and relentless all the same.
    Why? ***In a higher rates environment – if ever such a thing should come about
    – investors are going to demand more return for the risks they’re taking in the
    asset class. Defaults have been almost non-existent, so the popularity of high
    yield bonds in investor asset allocations is perfectly understandable. But higher
    rates have a tendency of disturbing this placidity like a skipped stone across
    the surface of a pond. And so $5 billion has come out of high yield funds in July,
    including the highest one-week redemptions in more than a year. Once again, this
    is the Big Money preparing for something new.***
