- en: The Trend Models are somewhat confusing this week, as the intermediate term
    Trend Model flipped from risk-on to risk-off, which is a downgrade, but the trading
    model, or direction of last change, moved to an unconfirmed positive. The obvious
    question is, "If the intermediate term model goes from 'risk-on' to 'risk-off',
    shouldn't the direction of last change be 'negative' instead of positive?"

- en: Trend Model signals are primarily based on the application of a highly systematic
    trend-following model, which uses crossing moving averages, on commodity prices
    and global equity prices. The details are of which moving averages, which commodities
    and indices and their weights are proprietary, but the conclusions are more of
    less the same no matter how you look at the global picture. However, trend-following
    models have two weaknesses (not bugs, but "features"). They tend to be late in
    calling tops and bottoms and, if there is no trend, their signals are subject
    to whipsaw which detract from performance.

  zh: 趋势模型的信号主要基于高度系统化的趋势跟踪模型的应用，该模型使用了商品价格和全球股票价格的交叉移动平均线。具体的移动平均线，哪些商品和指数以及它们的权重是专有的，但无论如何看待全局画面，结论基本上是一样的。然而，趋势跟踪模型有两个弱点（不是bug，而是“特点”）。它们往往在判断顶部和底部时太晚，而且如果没有趋势，它们的信号容易受到飞锯效应的影响，这会削弱性能。
- en: To address some of these weaknesses, I have relied on a series of sentiment
    based indicators to better time entry and exit points. These sentiment models
    primarily focus on measures of sentiment from option data, largely because the
    option market is reflective of what people are doing with their money rather than
    sentiment surveys where people express opinions which may or may not be acted
    upon. I also cross-check the conclusions from the option data models with overbought-oversold
    indicators. These short-term sentiment based indicators tend to used more for
    risk control purposes.

  zh: 为了解决这些弱点，我依赖一系列基于情绪的指标来更好地确定入场和出场时机。这些情绪模型主要关注期权数据的情绪测量，主要是因为期权市场反映了人们如何处理他们的资金，而不是情绪调查，在那里人们表达可能或可能不会被采取行动的观点。我还用超买-超卖指标来交叉验证期权数据模型的结论。这些基于短期情绪的指标更多地被用于风险控制目的。
- en: Here is an example of how the two components interact with each other. If the
    trend-following model is flashing a buy signal and the markets are in an uptrend,
    but the sentiment models are showing a crowded long and an extremely overbought
    condition, I would be inclined to either lower my long position, move to cash,
    or perhaps take a very small short position in anticipation of a pullback.

    Why? ***In a higher rates environment – if ever such a thing should come about
    – investors are going to demand more return for the risks they’re taking in the
    asset class. Defaults have been almost non-existent, so the popularity of high
    yield bonds in investor asset allocations is perfectly understandable. But higher
    rates have a tendency of disturbing this placidity like a skipped stone across
    the surface of a pond. And so $5 billion has come out of high yield funds in July,

    regime shift like the one we’re now seeing is guaranteed to cause volatility.
    Elephants cannot play musical chairs, even slowly, without some degree of breakage
    and collateral damage. Nor can large pools of invested capital switch themselves
    around in complete silence.

    I’m open to other opinions, but for it to be something big, you have to have a
    lot of things that look misfinanced. Where are there economic entities with short-term
    debt financing long term assets that look overvalued? Where have debts grown the
    most? I can’t identify a class like that unless we try student loans, or government
    debts. Corporate debt has grown, but doesn’t seem unreasonable now.

    is not cheap. Speculators may play; I will stay away.

    look ok and the recent bout of risk aversion is only a hiccup. He is therefore
    looking around for interesting bargains. In a future post, I will write about
    a few out-of-the box opportunities that I see in this market.
