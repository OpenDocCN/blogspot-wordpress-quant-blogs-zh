    cause the most confusion and consternation among investors, so one of the things
    I will strive to do in 2012 is take more of the Q&A exchanges that might be buried
    in the comments sections of previous posts and shine some light on them here.

    comment to [VIX Exchange-Traded Products: The Year in Review, 2011](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2011/12/vix-exchange-traded-products-year-in.html),
    which I fear may have been lost in the holiday shuffle. *[For the record, I tagged
    that post with my elusive “[hall of fame](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/hall%20of%20fame)”
    label, which I typically use to honor only handful of posts each year.]*'

    I would be remiss in not pointing out that the question suggests some confusion

- en: First things first, realized volatility is also known as historical volatility
    because it is based on past price moves, has already been observed, and can be
    calculated with great precision (see [Calculating Centered and Non-Centered Historical
    Volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/12/calculating-centered-and-non-centered.html)
    for more details.) This is essentially what an investor sees out his or her rear
    view mirror.

    is a very different animal from its realized/historical cousin. It boils down
    to the market’s best guess as to what (historical) volatility will look like in
    the future, based on how much investors are currently paying for options. The
    VIX is a specific instance of implied volatility and is based on options on the
    S&P 500 index over the course of the next 30 days. To return to the car analogy,
    it is what the consensus of drivers believe will be around the next bend and over
    the horizon.'

    past daily price moves in VQT for lookback periods of 10 days, 20 days, 30 days,
    50 days and 100 days. As these are calculated based on price moves, they are necessarily
    based on trading days, *not* calendar days, which are the unit of time used for
    implied volatility data.

- en: Looking at the table, these historical volatility numbers for VQT are in 10.50
    - 10.90 range for the past 30 trading days. The 100-day lookback window takes
    us back to early August, so it is not surprising that 100-day historical volatility
    is higher at 14.30.

    for comparison purposes. Note that historical volatility for the SPX has been
    100 – 130% higher than it has been for VQT during the same lookback periods.

    in options (optionsXpress, TradeMonster, Trade King, thinkorswim/TD Ameritrade,
    etc.) or from options data providers such as Livevol and iVolatility.
