- en: 'The classic Buy signal is developed as follows: After the low point of a primary
    downtrend in a Bear market is established, a secondary uptrend (this is the most
    often debated part of the Theory) bounce will occur. After that, a pullback on
    one of the averages must exceed 3%, according to Robert Rhea in his 1930''s The
    Dow Theory,  must then, ideally, hold above the prior lows on both the Industrial
    and the Transportation Averages. Finally, a breakout above the previous rally
    high by both, constitutes a BUY Signal for the developing Bull market.'

    in the shares of Avis. The technical pattern is consistent with the description
    of a Dow Theory buy signal.

    risks are lurking as I look forward to 2022.
