- en: '*CDSs are bilateral financial contracts in which one counterparty, the protection
    buyer, pays a periodic fee, typically expressed as a percentage of the notional
    amount, in return for a contingent payment by the protection seller following
    a credit event of a reference entity, usually a corporation. Payment is made when
    an issuer''s credit event, such as a bankruptcy, occurs.* *It sounds like an insurance
    policy, and in many ways, it is. Except, insurance policies cannot be traded,
    either individually or in baskets. Many financial institutions are using CDS''s
    to manage risk.'

    risk managers to be the new rock stars of Wall Street. More boring than Gordon
    Gecko, but definitely important post-2001.
