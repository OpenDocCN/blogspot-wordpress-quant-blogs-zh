    1% moves in the SPX so far – and all of those coming to the upside.

    Emerging Markets ETF Volatility Index ([VXEEM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXEEM))
    coincided with this period of languid volatility, which has made it easier for
    this index to fly under the radar.

- en: Today is the first time I am able to get data on the [VXEEM futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXEEM%20futures)
    in a market that is down at least 1% and I must admit to being somewhat surprised
    by the results.

    [EEM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EEM) and VXEEM data in the right
    column. Note that approximately one hour into today’s regular trading session,
    SPY was down about 1.3% and EEM, the popular [emerging markets](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/emerging%20markets)
    ETF, was down 3.1%. So far, so good. Far more interesting, while EEM was down
    about 2.4 times as much as SPY, the VIX was up substantially more than the VXEEM
    index, 16.57% to 12.62%...so while the selloff was disproportionately in emerging
    markets, the panic was disproportionately in the S&P 500 index.

    the [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures) and
    VXEEM futures. Interestingly enough, the changes in the front three month futures
    for both the VIX and VXEEM were almost identical.

- en: So what kind of volatility environment do we live in where the emerging markets
    index falls faster than the SPX (even beta-adjusted, but that discussion is for
    another day), while the VIX spikes much more than VXEEM, yet the futures for both
    products seem to move in almost identical fashion?

- en: If you think you have the answer, pairs trading opportunities with VIX products
    and the VXEEM futures and options (there are no ETPs yet that are based on VXEEM)
    are certainly there for the taking. While VXEEM futures and options are not particularly
    liquid or deep yet, they are sufficiently liquid and deep from which to extract
    some profits.
