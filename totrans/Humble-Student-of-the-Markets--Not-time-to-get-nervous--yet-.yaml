    Dow transport stocks not only failed to confirm the gain, they lurched decidedly

    for concern, but a tour around the world shows that major averages are in solid
    uptrends. In certain cases, the advance may have gone too far too fast and some
    gaps may need to get filled in on a pullback. Let's start in the United States

    selling and the excessive bullishness among newsletter writers as signs to be
    worried about. While I would be concerned excessive selling by insiders, i.e.
    the smart money, insiders have not always perfect at timing the market. As for
    the opinion of newsletter writers, I would argue that their excessive bullishness
    is actually bullish in this case as they provide buying power for the market.
    This is a case of watching what they do and not what they say. Anecdotal evidence
    from trading indicates that institutions and hedge funds have too little beta
    and they are in the process of beta chasing. BoAML strategist Savita Subramanian
    pointed out that Sell-Side Strategists were still extremely bearish on equities
    at the end of August:'

- en: The Sell Side Indicator, our measure of Wall Street bullishness on stocks, ticked
    up slightly in August for the first time in six months. However, this month’s
    improvement of 0.6ppt lifted the indicator to just 44.4, still at the lowest level
    in the history of our data (since 1985) apart from last month’s low of 43.9\.
    This suggests that sell side strategists’ bearishness on equities remains at 27
    year extremes. Given the contrarian nature of this indicator, we are encouraged
    by Wall Street’s lack of optimism and the fact that strategists are recommending
    that investors significantly underweight equities at 44.4% vs. a traditional long-term
    average benchmark weighting of 60-65%. The indicator remains firmly in “Buy” territory,
    a signal that it first flashed in May. Recall that we adjusted our Buy and Sell
    thresholds in November in an attempt to better incorporate secular shifts in equity
    sentiment.
