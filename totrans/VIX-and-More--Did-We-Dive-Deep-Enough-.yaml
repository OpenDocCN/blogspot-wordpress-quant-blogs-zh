    five weeks of increased volatility and a pullback in the S&P 500 that topped out
    at 6.7%, the question everyone is asking is whether the 6.7% drop was enough to
    wring out the excesses of the bull market and provide a wall of worry for further
    advances…or whether a nastier bear ambush lies just around the corner.'

- en: In a [Sentiment Primer (Long)](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/03/sentiment-primer-long.html),
    I did not spell out which scenario the sentiment indicators are pointing to, but
    if you read my comments on the [ISEE the previous day](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/03/isee-50-day-sma-is-bullish.html),
    you know that the case for a resumption of the bull market is strong.

- en: 'One group of indicators that I purposely left out of my sentiment primer is
    variously know as market internals, momentum, strength, etc.  These include market
    breadth (advance-decline lines) data, the number of new highs and lows, and the
    percentage of a group of stocks trading above certain moving averages, among others.  I
    will talk about these indicators in more detail in a future post, but for today
    I merely wish to update a chart I [first posted and discussed here two weeks ago](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/03/canary-or-canard_09.html):  a
    ratio chart of the new highs in the NYSE to the VIX.'

- en: The current version of the chart, appended below, shows the full extent of the
    effect on the ratio during the market pullback, in which a small “W” formed in
    the SPX.  By the standards of the past four years, the drop in the ratio was relatively
    mild compared to other drops, including the May-July 2006 correction.  This is
    partly due to the dramatic spike in the VIX, as we have discussed here ad nauseum,
    but also a function of the persistence of new highs in the NYSE, as recently noted
    by [Headline Charts](http://headlinecharts.blog.com/1650650/).

  zh: 附下方的图表最新版本，展示了市场回调期间该比率的影响，其中标普500指数（SPX）形成了一个小的“W”形态。根据过去四年的标准，该比率的变化相对于其他变化（包括2006年5月至7月的修正）来说相对温和，这部分是由于VIX的剧增，如我们在此处详尽讨论的那样，但也是由于纽约证券交易所（NYSE）创新高股票的持续性，如[Headline
    Charts](http://headlinecharts.blog.com/1650650/)最近所注意到的。
- en: For the last three years, the 52 week average (not plotted) for the NYSE new
    high to VIX ratio has held steady in the 10-14 range.  As current readings approach
    this range, the likelihood of the markets running into another bear ambush and
    bout of [echo volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/echo%20volatility)
    is slowly receding.

  zh: 在过去的三年中，纽约证券交易所创新高与VIX比率的一年平均值（未绘图）保持在10-14的范围内。随着当前读数接近这个范围，市场再次遭遇熊市突袭和[回声波动](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/echo%20volatility)的风险正在缓慢下降。
