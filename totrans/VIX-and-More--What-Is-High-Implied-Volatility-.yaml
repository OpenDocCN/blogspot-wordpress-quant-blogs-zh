- en: Ultimately, the assessment of what is high implied volatility is a subjective
    one, but typically the person attaching the label is making a comparison between
    current implied volatility levels and a historical range of either implied volatility
    or historical volatility levels.

- en: The most important piece of information to remember is that implied volatility
    is inherently forward looking and historical volatility is, by definition, backward
    looking. This is important because traders know when potential market moving events
    are coming and implied volatility moves accordingly. With historical volatility,
    on the other hand, it is much too easy to drive a car right into an unseen wall
    while trying to navigate by looking out the rear view mirror.

- en: When I think about implied volatility levels, I am usually looking at ‘relative
    volatility’ or implied volatility as a % of the most recent 52 week range. The
    recent volatility trend, if any, is also worth investigating. I always check the
    current IV-HV spread, but to switch metaphors, it is generally better to know
    about the hurricane headed your way than the one that has just passed through.
    Finally, it is critical to know if important events are just around the corner,
    such as earnings, an FDA decision, the resolution of important litigation, etc.
    When evaluating implied volatility for ETFs or indices (and data sensitive stocks,
    such as financials), upcoming events to focus on would likely be more along the
    lines of impending government data, proximity to Fed meetings, etc.
