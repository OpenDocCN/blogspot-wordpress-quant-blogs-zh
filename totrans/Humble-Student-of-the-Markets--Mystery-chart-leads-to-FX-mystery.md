# Humble Student of the Markets: Mystery chart leads to FX mystery

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2013/06/mystery-chart-leads-to-fx-mystery.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2013/06/mystery-chart-leads-to-fx-mystery.html#0001-01-01)

Further to my post Friday night (

[Would you short this?](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2013/06/would-you-short-this.html)

) From reading the comments, I can see that a lot of my readers got it. The chart is the AUDCAD currency cross. While this currency pair shows the Australian Dollar to be vulnerable to its Canadian cousin, the loonie, it brings up another mystery.

First of all, the pair may not be as technically vulnerable as it initially appeared because it hit a 50% retracement level on Friday despite breaking down from major multi-year support.

I understand how the hedge fund community seems to have piled into the AUDUSD short as the Aussie Dollar has gone into freefall for the last few weeks. The short position has been highly profitable in a very short time.

Here's the head scratcher. Why isn't its Canadian cousin similarly weak against the USD? The structure of the Australian and Canadian economies are very similar as they are both resource based and both about the same size.

Admittedly, Canada did see some surprisingly positive economic releases last Thursday (

) and Friday (

). On the other hand, how long will it be before all the Aussie shorts pile into a loonie short position as an alternative, especially when the CADUSD remains in a long-term downtrend and it hit a Fibonacci retracement level Friday and backed off? For reference, see these bearish posts on the Canadian Dollar from

Just asking.
