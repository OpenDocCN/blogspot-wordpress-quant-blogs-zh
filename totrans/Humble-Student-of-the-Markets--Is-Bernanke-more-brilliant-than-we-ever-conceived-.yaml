- en: Many analysts, myself included, have watched in horror as the Bernanke Fed seems
    to have ignored the perils of incipient inflation and monetary debasement in implementing
    QE and later QE2\. Lately I've been thinking that Ben Bernanke is a evil genius
    with a secret agenda that is more brilliant than anyone has conceived before.

    you never had to worry about inflation. Not now, not in the future, not ever.
    Because Aggregate Demand was too low now, and was projected to be too low forever.
    So you are not worried about inflation. Instead you are worried about deflation.
    And you were a government that could print your own money. What would you do?

- en: Suppose inflation isn't a problem right now, because Aggregate Demand is currently
    too low. Does that mean the government should print money and spend it? Not necessarily.
    ***Print money yes, but instead of spending it on goods, or on tax cuts, it might
    be better to use it to buy back some interest-paying government bonds.*** Because
    even though inflation isn't a problem right now, it may be a problem some time
    in the future. So you can buy the money back in future, by re-issuing the bonds
    (and save on interest in the meantime) without having to raise future taxes or
    cut future spending.

  zh: 假设目前通货膨胀不是一个问题，那是因为总体需求目前过低。但这并不意味着政府应该印钞票并花掉它。不一定。***印钞票是对的，但与其花在商品上，或者减税上，不如用它来回购一些付息的政府债券反而更好。***因为即便目前通货膨胀不是一个问题，但将来某个时候可能会成为一个问题。所以你可以通过重新发行债券（同时节省利息）在未来买回这些钱，而不必提高未来的税率或削减未来的开支。

    retiring government debt but putting the paper on the Fed's balance sheet. Nevertheless,
    the Treasury can now finance new debt at lower rates because Aggregate Demand
    is so weak.
