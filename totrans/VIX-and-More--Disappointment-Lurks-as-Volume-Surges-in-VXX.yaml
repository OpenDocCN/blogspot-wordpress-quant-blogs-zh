    or Long-Term Play](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/10/why-vxx-is-not-good-short-term-or-long.html),
    I figured that would likely be my last word on the subject. Well, I haven’t changed
    my mind, but I saw myself shaking my head more than a few times yesterday, when
    the volume in VXX surged to a new record, obliterating the old record by 50%.

    but yesterday’s numbers just reinforce my earlier points. Sure, VXX gained 1.87%
    on the day, but the VIX gained 6.32%. In other words VXX longs participated in
    less than 30% of the VIX spike.

    (VXX movement as a percentage of VIX movement) shows just how disappointing the
    performance of VXX relative to the VIX is when the VIX spikes. The bottom line
    is that when you need it most, VXX is at its worst in tracking the VIX.”*'

- en: When it comes to speculative or hedging plays using volatility products, VIX
    options (or futures) are typically the best choice. For short volatility positions,
    particularly when you see a VIX spike, think about shorting VXX. Those who favor
    long VXX positions have the odds stacked against them.
