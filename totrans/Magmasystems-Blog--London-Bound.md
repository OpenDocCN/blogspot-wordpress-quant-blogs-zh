I will be in London all next week, checking out the happenings in Canary Wharf. I have not been to London for a long time, so it will be interesting to see how built up the Wharf is. More interesting will be to see if they built any quality pubs. Last time I was in London, all of the pubs closed at 11 at night.

One nice thing will be to test our Virgin Atlantic's Business Class. I have been hearing tales of free massages .... hmmm ...
