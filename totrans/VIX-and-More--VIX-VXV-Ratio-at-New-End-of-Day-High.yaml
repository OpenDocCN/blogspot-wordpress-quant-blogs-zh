    as a market timing indicator and the first to talk about the [VIX:VXV ratio](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%3AVXV)
    when I posted on these subjects back in early December in [The VIX:VXV Ratio](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/12/vixvxv-ratio.html).

- en: Fast forward nine months and the VIX:VXV ratio has an admirable market timing
    record and a very strong following, here and elsewhere. Last night it set a new
    end of day high when the ratio closed at 1.20\. So far, readings of 1.08 and above
    have been good long entry points. Using the same logic, a long entry at 1.20 should
    be an even better trade. I will be interested to see how last night’s signal turns
    out.
