    is a study related to SPY and SPY volume that I've shown a few times in the Subscriber
    Letter.  It popped up in the Quantifinder again on Thursday.

    kind of decline despite the fact that it always occurs in an intermediate-term
    uptrend makes the study compelling enough to me to take under consideration.
