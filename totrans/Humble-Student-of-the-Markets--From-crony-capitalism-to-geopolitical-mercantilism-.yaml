    to prevent the bondholders of U.S. financial corporations from taking losses.
    We are using public funds to protect the bondholders of some of the most mismanaged
    companies in the history of capitalism, instead of allowing them to take losses
    that should have been their own. All our policy makers have done to date has been
    to squander public funds to protect the full interests of corporate bondholders.
    Even Bear Stearns' bondholders can expect to get 100% of their money back, thanks
    to the generosity of Bernanke, Geithner and other bureaucrats eager to hand out
    the money of ordinary Americans.

    of course, needed a loan, but more than that, each needed to make big changes
    so that the loan could really work. ***Almost always, countries in crisis need
    to learn to live within their means after a period of excess—exports must be increased,
    and imports cut—and the goal is to do this without the most horrible of recessions.***
    Naturally, the fund’s economists spend time figuring out the policies—budget,
    money supply, and the like—that make sense in this context. Yet the economic solution
    is seldom very hard to work out...'

    simple reason—the powerful elites within them overreached in good times and took
    too many risks.*** Emerging-market governments and their private-sector allies
    commonly form a tight-knit—and, most of the time, genteel—oligarchy, running the
    country rather like a profit-seeking company in which they are the controlling
    shareholders. When a country like Indonesia or South Korea or Russia grows, so
    do the ambitions of its captains of industry. As masters of their mini-universe,
    these people make some investments that clearly benefit the broader economy, but
    they also start making bigger and riskier bets. They reckon—correctly, in most
    cases—that their political connections will allow them to push onto the government
    any substantial problems that arise.'

    governments. Quite the contrary: at the outset of the crisis, the oligarchs are
    usually among the first to get extra help from the government, such as preferential
    access to foreign currency, or maybe a nice tax break, or—here’s a classic Kremlin
    bailout technique—the assumption of private debt obligations by the government.
    Under duress, generosity toward old friends takes many innovative forms. Meanwhile,
    needing to squeeze someone, most emerging-market governments look first to ordinary
    working folk—at least until the riots grow too large.'
