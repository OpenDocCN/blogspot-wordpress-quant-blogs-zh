    topic of the VelocityShares Daily 2x VIX Short-Term ETN ([TVIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TVIX))
    only to discover at a Bloomberg Volatility Symposium in San Francisco last night
    that there appears to be an insatiable demand for more information on the subject.
    While the links below should present the lion’s share of the background and context
    about the key issues related to TVIX, today I am presenting some additional information
    related to the volume of TVIX for the first two months of 2012 and the corresponding
    volumes in the front month and second month [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures).
    The graphic below plots daily volume in TVIX (solid black line) on the right Y-axis
    and volume in the front two months of VIX futures, using settlement prices from
    the CBOE Futures Exchange (CFE), on the left Y-axis.

    Suisse ([CS](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/CS)) announced a suspension
    of new creation units in TVIX after the close of the regular trading session on
    February 21, volume in both TVIX as well as the front month (dotted dark blue
    line) and second month (dashed medium blue line) dropped dramatically, almost
    in lockstep.

    where Credit Suisse feels comfortable about reopening the creation units window
    for TVIX remains to be seen, but for now at least, the new normal in the VIX futures
    markets and to some extent for TVIX is beginning to resemble the old normal of
    two months ago.
