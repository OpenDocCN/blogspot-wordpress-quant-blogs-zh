- en: As the end of 2012 draws closer, the crude oil market is entering the late stages
    of the commodity cycle. Despite political tension in the Middle East and monetary
    policies such as quantitative easing, the fundamentals still point to an increased
    risk of falling prices for crude oil. In this Webcast, Bloomberg Industries analyst
    Christian O'Neill will examine the effects that declining U.S. and EU demand will
    have on the global market; supply growth in the contiguous U.S. that could be
    surprising in scope and duration; and other factors likely to impact the market
    in the near and long term.
