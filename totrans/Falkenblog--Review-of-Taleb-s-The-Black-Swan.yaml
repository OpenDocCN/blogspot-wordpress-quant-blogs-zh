    quantified, is diversifiable, and thus becomes risk-free. If you know that your
    champagne bottle could burst while fermenting with probability p, that number
    becomes very manageable the larger your operation via the law of large numbers.
    Economists have been intrigued by this notion ever since, but by definition it
    is unquantifiable so when you write down a random process, it is no longer Knight-like,
    making it rather elusive. However, when we come up with uncertainty proxies, such
    as volatility (surely more volatile assets are generally more uncertain), leptokurtosis
    (asymmetric tails), or analyst or investor disagreement, the results do not have
    any obvious empirical implication beyond the fact that they exist. That is, assets
    with greater downside tail, or analyst disagreement, conditional upon gaussian
    volatility measures, are not predictive of future returns.

    factor approach, in which every asset has a sensitivity to a factor, and every

    essential in planning the allocation of capital, yet in risky situations becomes

    we ‘lose’, will bring forth situations we have not prepared for, but the best

    Kurtosis基金，关于该基金的公开数据表明其夏普率相当低（2000年涨幅60％，但后来波动）。之后Taleb称该基金为对冲基金或实验室。虽然两种策略都不太好，而且回报是专有的，但我敢说，如果只看他们的终身夏普率，Niederhoffer的更好。Taleb最新的基金，虽然他日常参与度较低，但实现了他对极端情况的基本信念，于2008年有显着增长。尽管这在极端下降时是意料之中的，并且与Empirica的起步相似。

    trade is where a trader finds a strategy with a positive mode, but zero or negative
    mean. He then uses someone else’s capital to make money off several years of good
    returns, making good money for creating or managing the strategy, then, when the
    strategy gives it all back, the investor bears all the loss. The zero mean means
    that all the modal returns come crashing down in short time, generating large
    losses, and the manager walks away with his il-gotten bonuses from the benign
    modal periods. That’s a bad strategy for the investor, and the trader who manages
    it is either naïve or duplicitous. High Yield debt is a good example, as the stated
    yields are quite high, but the total returns to B rated bonds is the same as for
    BBB rated bonds, at several times the risk (and very concentrated in recessions).

    such as the fact that two Gaussian random variables added together is also a Gaussian
    random variable. In practice, no one actually believes in this view, and makes
    ad hoc adjustments, such as the volatility smile for option prices. The key is
    that from an expositional point of view, the Gaussian distribution usually gives
    one the gist of the true ‘fatter-tailed’ distribution, and allows easy exposition.
    Non-economists often giggle at the term ‘fat-tailed’ or homoskedasticity, but
    indeed most real world distributions are not ‘Normal’ or Gaussian, they simply
    have fatter tails than average. Does this imply statistics is a fraud? Well, if

  zh: 《黑天鹅》认为标准统计是有缺陷的，因为它是向后看的——它使用‘历史’数据——并且认为标准风险度量，比如正态分布是‘骗局’。我也更喜欢未来数据，但这几乎不切实际。高斯分布在理论上很常见，因为它是如此易于分析；它经常会产生封闭形式的解，使人可以看清一个变量如何影响另一个变量，并且具有很好的性质，比如两个高斯随机变量相加后仍然是一个高斯随机变量。在实践中，没有人真正相信这种观点，并且做出了临时调整，比如期权价格的波动率笑容。关键在于，从阐述的角度来看，高斯分布通常会给出真实的‘尾部更厚’分布的要点，并且易于阐述。非经济学家们往往会对‘尾部厚’或者同方差性这个词儿感到好笑，但事实上大多数实际世界的分布都不是‘正态’或高斯分布，它们只不过比平均值有更厚的尾部。这是否意味着统计学是一种骗局？嗯，如果你把地图错当成了领土，那确实是新闻。对于每个有些常识的人来说，这只是一种近似或阐述工具而已。

    any specific error metric (standard deviation, value-at-risk, correlation, R2,
    etc) is, in his mind, a fraud and useless because it relies on an assumption,
    one that is 'wrong'. He argues we reward those who imagine the impossible, but
    what does that mean in practice? That we encourage people to enumerate everything
    possible no matter how improbable? In finance, these risk reports are all too
    common because they reflect a lot of work, in that generating a list of unprioritized
    things that could happen is easy but practically useless, because you simply can’t
    address all the points and so must leave them as mere ‘I told you so’ observations.
