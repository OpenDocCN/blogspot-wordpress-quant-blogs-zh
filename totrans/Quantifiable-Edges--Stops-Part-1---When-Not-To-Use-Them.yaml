    a stop on a position is a very popular risk management technique used by traders.
    My research and experience has led me to believe they are appropriate for some
    – but not all – types of trades. Today I will discuss when I believe they aren’t
    appropriate.

    a chapter to stops. It’s entitled, “Stops Hurt”. The chapter discusses how Larry’s
    research team ran hundreds of tests to try and find optimal stop levels. In doing
    so they came to the conclusion that for the trades they were looking at, the optimal
    stop was consistently none at all. In every case they found that instituting stops
    hurt system performance.

    Much of what I do is mean reversion based also. For instance, the Catapult system
    which makes up the CBI looks to buy stocks that are undergoing capitulative selling.
    It enters long positions in stocks or ETFs that are extremely oversold. When I
    first designed the system in 2005 I went through a massive series of tests to
    find a way to successfully incorporate stops into the methodology. Like Larry
    I failed to find a stop technique that would enhance the performance of the system.

    again. When looking to trade overbought/oversold techniques, stops generally don’t
    work well. If the system suggests the security should bounce when it drops to
    $20 and it continues to $18 then it is REALLY overdue for a bounce. Any level
    of stop ensures you are selling an extremely oversold security that is making
    a low. Those are buying conditions for oversold systems – not selling conditions.

- en: Wait until the security bounces for a bar or two. Look for a higher high, higher
    low, and higher close – or at least 2 of those 3\. Then place a stop under the
    swing low that was just made. In cases like this even if the security doesn’t
    hit your target exit price, it still ensures that you won’t have to suffer through
    the entire next leg down. While it seems logical and can sometimes help avoid
    catastrophic trades in the long run you’re normally better off just waiting for
    the mean reversion to occur and exiting at your target level.

    very important. Traders could also consider using options to trade their short-term
    positions. Options provide a natural stop (zero). I wrote a series back in the
    Spring (when the VIX was a lot lower) on how I sometimes use options for my short-term
    trading. You can find links to that series below:'
