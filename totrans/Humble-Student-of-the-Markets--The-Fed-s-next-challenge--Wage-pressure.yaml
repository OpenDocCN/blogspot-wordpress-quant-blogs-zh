    meeting. Markets took a risk-off tone, but Jerome Powell walked back some of the
    hawkishness during his Congressional testimony the following week. The Fed Chair
    stuck to his familiar refrain that inflation is transitory, dismissed the idea
    of 1970s-style inflation as “very, very unlikely”, and unemployment is transitory
    but labor markets need continued support.

    pricing in most asset classes. But in order for the markets to continue accept
    the Fed's narrative, the next challenge for the Fed is cost-push inflation in
    the form of wage pressure. This will become more apparent with the release of
    the June Employment Report in the coming week.
