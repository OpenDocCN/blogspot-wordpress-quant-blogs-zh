    for the high beta stocks are about 0.14% higher than the S&P500, which when multiplied
    by 12 is a 1.7% difference. But looking at the chart which shows a total return
    chart, and the geometric annualized return, we see a very different picture, with
    the high beta stocks underperforming by 3.5% annually.

    the differential annualized return. Interestingly, the return rankings for these
    data are different depending on the horizon!

    and I think that's a good assumption for an investment horizon. It seems that
    1 year would be the obvious horizon to apply data against, but the problem is
    there is so little of it. There's like twelve times as much monthly data! A simple
    fix would be to use log returns, but this doesn't always happen, and I think those
    who still find the
