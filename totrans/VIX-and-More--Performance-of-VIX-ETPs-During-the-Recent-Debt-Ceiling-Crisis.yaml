- en: Since the first big wave of [VIX ETPs](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20ETN)
    hit in 2010, I have periodically plotted all these products on a grid that used
    the y-axis for leverage and the x-axis for target maturity. While the initial
    intent was to highlight [roll yield](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/roll%20yield)
    risk and leverage/compounding risk, over time I was unable to resist the urge
    to indicate which ETPs were optionable, which had both long and short legs, which
    had legs that were dynamically allocated, which had non-VIX components, etc. In
    other words, I fell victim to my unceasing need to try to tell an entire story
    on one slide, no doubt due in part to having seen too many 80-page presentations
    put together by consulting teams…

- en: That being said, today’s iteration of my graphical depiction (“field guide”)
    of the VIX ETP universe is somewhat of a compromise. This compromise is due in
    part to the proliferation of VIX ETPs that combine long and short legs and have
    those legs dynamically allocated. The first of these to launch (back on August
    31, 2010) was the Barclays ETN+ S&P VEQTOR ETN ([VQT](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VQT)),
    which was followed by the First Trust CBOE S&P 500 Tail Hedge Fund ETF ([VIXH](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIXH))
    on August 29, 2012 and later by the PowerShares S&P 500Downside Hedged Portfolio
    ([PHDG](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/PHDG)) on December 6, 2012\.
    The field became considerably more crowded this year when VelocityShares launched
    the Tail Risk Hedged Large Cap ETF ([TRSK](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TRSK))
    and the Volatility Hedged Large Cap ETF ([SPXH](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TRSK))
    on June 24, 2013.

- en: Rather than cramming these five similar products into the same narrow space,
    I have separated them from the grid and given them their own “VIX Strategy ETPs”
    box. With VIXH and PHDG now having a reasonable body of historical data to analyze,
    I have had a fair amount to say about these products already and will have more
    to say about them in the near future. TRSK and SPXH present an entirely different
    approach to hedging with volatility products and I will devote a separate post
    to these in short order.

    volatility ETPs from September 20 (when the VIX closed at 13.12) to October 8
    (when the VIX closed at 20.34), when the [VIX spiked](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20spikes)
    55% increase in just 12 trading days. As the graphic shows, for the most part
    the higher the leverage and the shorter the duration, the better the VIX ETP performed
    during the crisis. The performance of the VIX strategy ETPs was a mixed bag, with
    only TRSK posting a gain during this period. Another perennial hedging favorite,
    XVZ, also posted a gain.

- en: The trick with these hedges is one of timing.  As has been noted here on many
    instances in the past, the top performers in a crisis are typically those which
    are ravaged by price decay due to roll yield and/or compounding when the VIX does
    not spike. Compare the winners and losers in the graphic below with the winners
    and losers tallied in [VIX ETP Performance in 2012](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2013/01/vix-etp-performance-in-2012.html)
    to gets a sense of how expensive it can be to carry speculative long volatility
    positions as well as more dynamic hedging positions over the course of an extended
    period. The bottom line is that it is almost impossible to create a VIX ETP that
    will perform well when the VIX spikes and when there is below average volatility
    or expectations of future volatility.

    in order to be positioned to take advantage of increases and decreases in volatility,
    only that most buy-and-hold scenarios have a negative long-term expectation and
    timing the volatility market is probably more difficult than timing the equities
    market.

    difficulty navigating the January 15 deadline for funding the government or the
    February 7 deadline for raising the debt ceiling once again, then look no farther
    than the graphic above for some ideas about how to trade these events.
