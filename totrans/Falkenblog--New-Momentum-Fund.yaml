    and size in Ken French's data, yet clearly less popular. Yet unlike size, value
    and more recently low-vol, hardly any products out there attempt to specifically
    harvest the momentum premium in an efficient manner. The problem is that momentum
    peaked in November 2008, and has not recovered (graph below using French's data).
     Many think it may never recover, which perhaps is why the main momentum fund,
    HMTM, trades only ten thousand shares a day.

    think it will be attractive because momentum tends to do particularly well when
    low volatility and value fails (e.g. late nineties was horrible for value and
    low-vol, but great for momentum). More importantly, their fund has some secret
    sauce.  I can't say what that is, but I can vouch for the fact that there is a
    way to play momentum that works much better than the standard approach used in
    academic papers.
