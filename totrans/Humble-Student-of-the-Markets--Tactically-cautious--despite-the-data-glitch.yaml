    500 EPS estimates had dropped about -0.50 across the board over the last three
    weeks (see [2020 is over, what's the next pain trade?](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2021/01/10/2020-is-over-whats-the-next-pain-trade/)).

    of consensus estimates revealed a sudden drop in EPS estimates three weeks ago.
    Discontinuous changes like that are highly unusual, and it was traced to the inclusion
    of heavyweight Tesla in the S&P 500\. In this case, analyzing the evolution of
    consensus earnings before and after the Tesla inclusion was not an apples-to-apples
    comparison. My previous bearish conclusion should therefore be discounted.

    resolving this data anomaly.
