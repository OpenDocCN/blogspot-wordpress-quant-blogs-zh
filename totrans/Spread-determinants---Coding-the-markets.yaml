    [Harris](http://www.tradingandexchanges.com) goes on to summarise the main three
    spread determinants as asymmetric information, volatility and utilitarian trading
    interest. Utilitarian interest is trading by investors, hedgers and gamblers rather
    than market makers. Volatility can be measured, but the other two factors can’t.'

    be hit by the [adverse selection](https://etrading.wordpress.com/2006/08/31/adverse-selection-and-uninformed-traders/)
    of the well informed traders. Consequently they’ll set spreads wide to recover
    the costs of adverse selection from uninformed traders.

    rates world. I can imagine all kinds of asymmetry in the equity world, from insider
    knowledge to detailed sector research. But what is there to know about a straight
    government bond ?  It’s principal, coupons and maturity. Given those we can calculate
    its present value. Of course, [it’s not quite as simple as that](http://www.quantnotes.com/fundamentals/bonds/bondpricing.htm),
    but my point is that there’s no potentially hidden information. This *should*
    lead to narrow spreads.
