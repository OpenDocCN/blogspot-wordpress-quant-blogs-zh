- en: After a classic mean-reverting snap back [last week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/03/vwsi-snaps-back-to-neutral.html),
    the VIX Weekly Sentiment Indicator (VWSI) took more of a meandering approach in
    the most recent week, registering only a -3 reading following Tuesday’s 30% spike
    and a -4 on Wednesday, when the VIX topped out at 21.25, a reading not seen since
    June 2006.  While technically any reading below zero has to be considered to be
    somewhat bearish for the VIX, the current -2 reading is still within the -3 to
    +3 neutral zone, where I do not consider the statistical edge and risk/reward
    profile of the VIX to warrant taking either a long or short position.

- en: At a little less than 4% over the VIX’s 10 day SMA of 16.18, it is difficult
    to make a case that the VIX is over or undervalued at current levels.  It is worth
    recalling that the VIX [tends to fizzle on Fed Days](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/01/vix-price-movement-around-fomc-meetings.html)
    and [almost never spikes 10%](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/01/more-on-vix-fizz-on-fed-days.html),
    so it is particularly difficult to make the case for being long the VIX going
    into the upcoming Fed announcement.  For those looking to trade the VIX, this
    is a good time to be patient and wait for better setups.

    apply to the VIX, not to the broader markets, which are usually negatively correlated
    with the VIX.)
