    worked well recently are considered smart. They took ''good risks''. When one
    loses money, they simply were foolish, such as going long mortgages in 2007\.
    If you went long these in early 2009 you weren''t lucky, you were smart. Risk
    taking seems only to apply to past trades that worked out well, those that did
    not work are just dumb. This creates a lot of confusion as to the true nature
    of risk.'

    the market rally and the VIX has come down from 80 to 25). 12 months is a very
    short time frame to evaluate any strategy, but for a journalist highlighting business
    geniuses, it's a lifetime.

    studies in 'best practices' management, they emphasized their 'risk management'
    and received plaudits there. (I think there's a strategy in going short any company
    who's senior risk officer wins 'risk manager of the year' from GARP or RISK Magazine).
    Golden West Financial won an award as 'best mortgage lender' from Forbes before
    its portfolio took down otherwise prudent Wachovia.

    lemmings. One can imagine the sales presentations to investors, as management
    highlights how their meticulous deal-by-deal analysis enabled them to score big
    gains this year. That is, they make a beta bet (long distressed securities) look
    like pure alpha. This is easy to do in distressed because invariably the benchmark
    is not as obvious as it is for a diversified US equity portfolio.

    return, a risk-adjusted return, and as 'risk' is not definable, this gives people
    a lot of degrees of freedom. Further, it has long been the case that successful
    people are good at doing one thing while saying they are doing another. Augustus
    Ceasar was successful because unlike Julius Ceasar he appeased the senators by
    making it seem like he restored the Republic (where the senate is in charge),
    when in practice he had probably more power than Julius Ceasar. When unions are
    successful they promote their agenda by appealing to how they are helping their
    customers, assiduously maintaining quality via their exclusionary rules. Affirmative
    Action was successful because proponents said it definitely does not imply quotas.
    The key is that many large strategies involve duplicity.

    doing a beta bet on Y. I was talking to someone recently who noted a mutual friend
    was making a lot of money 'day trading spiders'. I don't think anyone can make
    a lot of money day trading spiders, but hope springs eternal and lots of people
    like to believe that anyone who made money recently, made such money via alpha,
    not a dumb bet. It's a better story than the truth, something like being long
    mortgages, because we all know how risky that bet was.
