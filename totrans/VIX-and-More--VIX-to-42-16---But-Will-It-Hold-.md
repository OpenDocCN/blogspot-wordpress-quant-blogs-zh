# VIX and More: VIX to 42.16...But Will It Hold?

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/09/vix-to-4216but-will-it-hold.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/09/vix-to-4216but-will-it-hold.html#0001-01-01)

So we have a new line in the sand right now, a VIX of 42.16 (and SPX of 1133).

Note that when the VIX continues to spike to new highs even as the markets are not making new lows, then we have extreme fear.

To answer a question in a post below, there is no reason why the VIX cannot spike above 45 today, though I do not expect that to happen.

In terms of a potential bottom, the big fly in the ointment is the calendar. Tomorrow is options expiration, which is followed by a weekend in which I can't imagine many investors will be comfortable with large long positions. As a result, if the markets do not show some strength in the second half of today's session, they are not likely to be strong tomorrow or Monday morning.
