    on this concern last summer. For exchanges with fully protected quotes, the [regulation](http://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-51808.pdf)
    (see parts with “immediately and automatically”) very explicitly prohibits a deliberate
    delay like the ‘magic shoebox’ IEX employs. [[3](#bottom)] Something akin to this
    delay was [proposed](http://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/phlx/2012/34-67680.pdf) and
    rejected a few years ago on a minor exchange operated by Nasdaq, PSX. Evidently
    the SEC is reconsidering its judgement on that:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The source familiar with the SEC’s thinking on the matter said PSX may have
    been ahead of its time. The regulator now will likely look at the IEX case with
    the perspective that Reg NMS was written some 10 years ago, the source said.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, there are some important differences between IEX’s model and what PSX tried
    to do. But I get the sense from the above that those differences are not what’s
    changing the SEC’s thinking. Of course, questioning regulation that may be outdated
    is a good thing, but it’s important to question it in a sensible way. Allowing
    quotes to have a delay seems perfectly harmless, until you consider making them
    displayed, protected quotes. To see why, it’s useful to consider the analogy with
    liquidity-provider rebates.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Liquidity-provider rebates are controversial for a variety of reasons. One of
    those reasons is that, in combination with the order protection rule, they can
    create a ‘race to the bottom’ where exchanges are compelled by competitive forces
    to have higher and higher rebates. Imagine a world where Exchange A has a $1.00
    per share rebate and commensurate access fee. Exchange B has no rebate and no
    access fee. Say the market values QCOM stock at $50 and an investor is trying
    to sell 100 shares of it. Maybe there’s a bid on Exchange B for $50.00\. On Exchange
    A, however, the bids are about $50.99 – because the bidder will be paid an extra
    dollar upon execution. Under the order protection rule, Exchange B is nominally
    offering the best bid so the investor’s sell order *must* be routed to Exchange
    B – even if the investor’s effective sell price after fees will be $49.99, a penny
    worse than the price available on Exchange A. Thus, in order to maintain market
    share, exchanges would continually raise their rebates to be greater than those
    offered by competitors. It’s not hard to see how this would spiral out of control.
    The SEC placed a 0.3 cent cap on access fees partly for this reason and there
    has been [plenty](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/07/28/nasdaq-omx-congress-marketsrules-idUSL2N0Q31FH20140728)
    of [talk](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/bats-to-sec-lets-end-maker-taker-system-of-market-fees-2015-01-06)
    that even this level is too high.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I’d argue that adding an intentional delay into an exchange is the temporal
    version of the price distortion caused by high rebates. Consider what would happen
    if an Exchange implemented a 10 second delay. Any time the market moved, all incoming
    orders (on any exchange, marketable or otherwise) would have to be routed to the
    stale, inaccessible quotes displayed by the delayed exchange. [[4](#bottom)] If
    the traders on the delayed exchange who deleted those now-stale quotes changed
    their minds and quickly re-submitted orders, they might get executed against some
    of those incoming orders that were required to route to the delayed exchange.
    Much of the time, the routed-in orders would not get executed and would have to
    be repeatedly tried again. The result being mostly that investors would need to
    wait longer for orders to get executed at worse prices. But, as a side-effect
    of the routing, the delayed exchange would gain market share. [[5](#bottom)] Other
    exchanges, in response, would be spurred to institute their own delays, making
    the market completely non-functional.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Thinking of our analogy with access fees, disaster could be averted if a cap
    on the additional delay were established. What should that cap be? My intuition
    is that the cap should be, at most, 10% of the typical time it takes for orders
    to be routed. It’s no coincidence that this is right around the level of IEX’s
    delay. IEX states that the delay allows their system to update its view of the
    NBBO. [[6](#bottom2)] The NBBO (at its fastest) generally changes at about the
    routing timescale (which is complicated, but around 2ms [[7](#bottom2)]). And
    a large chunk of the routing timescale is due to exchanges deciding what to do
    with an order based on the prices they see on other exchanges. This process is
    similar to what IEX needs to do when updating their view of the NBBO, except IEX
    does not need to spend time assembling an order to send to another exchange.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I don’t want to get into the actual value of the delay. But I will say that
    an exchange with good technology should not have trouble updating their view of
    the market much, much faster than 350us. I have, on rare occasions, seen orders
    executing at the old NBBO after a single tick up or down. [[8](#bottom2)] This
    has always been on dark pools though; I’ve never seen it on a major exchange.
    Goldman’s Sigma-X was [fined](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-07-01/goldman-sachs-got-lost-in-its-own-dark-pool)
    for this very reason, so it’s not just an imaginary issue. IEX rightfully wants
    to ensure that this won’t happen to their customers. That said, Goldman updated
    their system and fixed the issue. I imagine IEX could do the same. [[9](#bottom2)]

    quantity from this buy order starts going through Nasdaq’s routing software.*   A
    small IEX offer of 10.01 is re-submitted, but is pending their additional delay.*   The
    original IEX offer disappears from the public data feed.*   A new Nasdaq offer
    of 10.01 is re-submitted.*   The new IEX offer of 10.01 has finished going through
    its additional delay.*   The original routed bid of 10.01 from Nasdaq finally
    has finished making its way to IEX and finished its additional delay, partially
    executing against the newly added small order resting on IEX.*   The original
    routed bid was only partially filled and, being an IOC order, leaves the customer
    needing to send a new order to finish their execution. The customer does so, but
    by the time they do the previously available Nasdaq offer has been deleted.

    of latency for any order action taken by a participant (enter, cancel, revise

    the minimum timescale for routing and inter-exchange synchronization is to look
    at how long it takes for orders to start executing 1 cent through the previous
    NBBO after an incoming aggressive trade. You can see from this [plot](https://mechanicalmarkets.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/toa-exchangesummary-13661.png)

    have a policy (sometimes enabled at the customer’s discretion) of not executing
    orders at times like these. On very rare occasions, I recall seeing orders execute
    even outside of the *old* NBBO. I couldn’t begin to tell you why that should happen,
    but I’ve only seen it on dark pools with pretty pathetic volume. It’s possible
