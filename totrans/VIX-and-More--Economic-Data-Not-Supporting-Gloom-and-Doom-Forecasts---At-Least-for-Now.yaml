- en: For over a year I have been examining how economic data in the United States
    has been faring relative to expectations and have been posting graphics that show
    the trends in five groups (manufacturing/general, housing/construction, employment,
    consumer and prices/inflation) in order to get a better sense of which pockets
    in the economy have been exceeding expectations and which have been lagging. *[For
    the detailed graphics see links 2-8 below.]*

- en: The last time around ([Economic Data vs. Expectations and Stock Prices](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2011/06/economic-data-vs-expectations-and-stock.html),
    June 2, 2011) I elected to switch to a graphic which aggregated the data across
    all five categories in order to drive home the main point, which was that the
    economic reports were consistently missing expectations, sometimes by a wide margin,
    even though stock prices seemed to be largely treading water. Stocks held on for
    another few weeks, but ultimately they began to act like the data – as if they
    had an anchor tied to their ankle.

  zh: 上次([经济数据 vs. 预期和股价](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2011/06/economic-data-vs-expectations-and-stock.html),
    2011年6月2日)我选择了一张图表，它综合了所有五个类别的数据，以强调主要观点，即经济报告一直未达到预期，有时相差甚远，尽管股价似乎大部分在原地踏步。股市又坚持了几周，但最终它们开始表现得像数据——好像它们的脚踝上绑了一个锚。
- en: '[Today’s consumer confidence data](http://www.conference-board.org/data/consumerconfidence.cfm)
    was another big miss, but the trend for the last two weeks has been one of data
    that is slightly better than expected. At the very least there are some signs
    that the deluge of bearish data which began in early May ran its course during
    the third week in August. Whether this is just a pause before the August swoon
    begins to show its impact in next month’s data remains to be seen, but for now
    at least the data show slowing growth. Call it partly cloudy and a chance of gloom.'

  zh: 今天的消费者信心数据](http://www.conference-board.org/data/consumerconfidence.cfm)又一次大幅未达预期，但过去两周的趋势是数据略好于预期。至少有一些迹象表明，从5月初开始的熊市数据洪流在8月下旬的第三周已经结束。是否这只是一个8月萧条影响下个月数据的暂停还有待观察，但至少现在数据显示经济增长正在放缓。可以称之为部分多云，有忧郁的可能。
- en: Finally, I cannot help but wonder aloud once again about the old dictum that
    the stock market looks not at the current economic environment, but at what conditions
    are expected to be in about 6-9 months. In the chart below it appears that for
    the better part of the past year, stocks have been more of a simultaneous reflection
    of current data than a predictor of what may lie down the road.

  zh: 最后，我忍不住再次大声猜测那个古老的格言：股市不是看当前的经济环境，而是预期大约6-9个月后的条件。在下面的图表中，股市在过去的一年中更多的是对当前数据的即时反应，而不是对未来道路的预测。
