    the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

- en: I had a discussion last week with another investment professional about the
    possible short-term asset price effects of portfolio rebalancing. Equities had
    handily beaten fixed income investments during the quarter, and balanced fund
    managers will have to rebalance their portfolios by selling stocks and buying
    bonds.

    are talking about it. To add to the confusion, JPMorgan's derivatives analyst
    Marko Kolanovic put out a research note stating that "there will be no monthly
    selling, and indeed there could be buying of equities into month-end. A lack of
    these flows, and broad anticipation of ‘month/quarter-end’ effect, could result
    in the market moving higher near term, all else equal."
