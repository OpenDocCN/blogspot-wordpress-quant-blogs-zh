# Magmasystems Blog: Recent Buyouts - Tibco/SPlus, Progress/Iona

> 来源：[http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2008/06/recent-buyouts-tibcosplus-progressiona.html#0001-01-01](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2008/06/recent-buyouts-tibcosplus-progressiona.html#0001-01-01)

Progress

(aka Computer Associates Lite (hi Louie!)) just bought out Iona, the makers of

Orbix

. Like most companies, we have pockets of legacy apps that use

Orbix

, and most companies that I know (including ours) are on a mission to replace

Orbix

.

A strategy that Computer Associates used to pursue (maybe they still do) was to buy legacy products that were entrenched in the mainframe-based systems that big companies used, and then to extract

exorbitant

license and

maintenance

fees from the existing customers. I am sure that Progress will not go with that kind of strategy, but it will be interesting to see what they do with

Orbix

.

The more interesting acquisition is

Tibco's

purchase of

SPlus

. Despite what the various pundits of the

CEP

world say, I still think that analytics are an integral part of the

CEP

stack.

SPlus

is used by a good part of the

Quant

world today. So, it is with a bit of alarm that I view the acquisition of the

SPlus

line by a single

CEP

vendor, especially since some of the CEP vendors already (or are planning to) have hooks into SPlus.

I consider a "

CEP

-

ish

" product like

Tibco

Business Events to be in a different category than a pure

CEP

-play like Coral8 and

Aleri

. I think of Business Events as being a more

workflow

-oriented product, something that you would NOT use to pump Level2 quotes through and create

algo

apps with. There are certainly synergies between Business Events and

SPlus

, and the acquisition makes perfect sense from a business standpoint. However, my concern is what it means for people who are using it with other

CEP

engines.

Hopefully,

Tibco

will treat

SPlus

like it treats

Spotfire

.... kind of like an independent entity.

*(Thanks to Paul for correcting me about the Tibco product names ... I originally called Business Events by another name ...)*
