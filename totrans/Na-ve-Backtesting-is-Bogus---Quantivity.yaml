    enough traders doing enough [data snooping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-snooping_bias)

    viscosity be given the past? Many years of effort could go into analyzing this

    recall the relationship between temperature and viscosity. Shortly thereafter,

    it should be that the fundamentals of economics and finance are not stable: *nearly
    every statistical measure in common use across nearly all asset classes exhibited
    inconsistent behavior over this period* (mean, variance, volatility, covariance,
    correlation, cointegration, principal components, skew, kurtosis, *etc*.). Introductory
    economics informs us the root causes for these instabilities are many, ranging
    from [business cycles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_cycle) to [monetary
    policy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy).'

    way continuing to faithfully believe in the wisdom of backtesting. By the above
    analogy, traders would benefit from refining their quantitative methodologies
    to accommodate systemic biases—rather than blindly backtesting over long periods
    of time, with no concern for [externalities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality)
    such as market regime.
