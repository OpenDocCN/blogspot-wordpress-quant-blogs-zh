Here is a preview of the results for the DV Smoothed Double Stochastic Oscillator for the last 3000 bars. Note that the default setting for the stochastic is 10 days.Both long and short signals work well on an annualized basis, and extreme levels of the stochastic are very accurate predictors for next day returns whether going long or short. The edge is very significant:
