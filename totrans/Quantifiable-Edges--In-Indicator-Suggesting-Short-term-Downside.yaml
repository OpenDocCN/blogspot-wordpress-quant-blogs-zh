    calculation is proprietary but in general it looks at relative volume across multiple
    Nasdaq securities. Historically, very low readings have often been followed by
    quick declines and high readings have been followed by quick bounces. Below is
    a copy of the chart from the website.

    to see how the QQQQ has performed following other readings below -10.

    over the next 2 days.
