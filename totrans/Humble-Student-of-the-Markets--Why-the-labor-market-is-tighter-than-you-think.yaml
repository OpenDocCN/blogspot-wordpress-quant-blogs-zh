    tight is the labor market?" A related question is, "In the face of tame inflation
    statistics, when are we going to see evidence of rising wage growth?"

    meeting next week, but it faces a debate about the future path of interest-rate

    monetary policy. Additional data indicates that the labor market is tighter than
    the market consensus, and a rise in inflation is just around the corner.
