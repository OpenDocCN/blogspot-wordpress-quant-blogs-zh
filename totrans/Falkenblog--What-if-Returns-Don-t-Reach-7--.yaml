- en: The return-on-investment targets of 7% to 8% that are structured into pension
    plans are beyond reach in today's artificial environment. To redeem their promises
    to retiring teachers, firemen and the like, managers are risking more money with
    hedge funds in hope of yields higher than those on safer investments.

    not going to happen, and this failure will act as positive feedback in the upcoming
    fiscal disaster; when the pension funds all under perform and need more money,
    it will be the nail in the coffin. I think the tinder will be inflation, which
    the central banks seem to think is the cure for their GDP ills (and those of underperforming
    pensions), so they will push until it comes back.
