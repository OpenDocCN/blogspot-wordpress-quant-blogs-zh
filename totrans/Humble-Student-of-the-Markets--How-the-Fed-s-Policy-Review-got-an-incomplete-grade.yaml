    a shift towards an "average inflation targeting" regime, where the Fed "seeks
    to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time". The other was an emphasis
    on to target low unemployment. Instead of minimizing “deviations from the maximum"
    employment, it will minimize “shortfalls of employment from its maximum level.”

    much effort, but the assignment is incomplete, and leaves many questions unanswered.

    inflation rate, when it was unable to do so for many years? Is it because its
    lab partner, fiscal policy, failed to work on the assignment?

    target of 2% is credible, how far above 2% will the 10-year Treasury yield be,
    and what will that do to the economy and stock prices?

    the bond market in the wake of Powell's speech. Wouldn't a credible 2% average
    inflation target translate into a substantial surge in bond yields? How far above
    2% does the 10-year Treasury have to trade? What does that mean for equity valuations?

    next 10 years, you would certainly demand a Treasury yield of over 2%, say 2.5%.
    The 10-year yield needs to rise by at least 1.8%. What would that do to the economy,
    and the stock market?

    investors have justified the high multiple by pointing to low rates. TINA, or
    There Is No Alternative. Valuations are reasonable based on equity risk premium
    (ERP), which is some variation of E/P - interest rates. Here is the Q2 2020 ERP
    calculation of Antonio Fatas, professor of economics at INSEAD. While the stock
    market appears reasonably priced based on ERP today, raising rates by 1.8% (everything
    else being equal) would make stocks far less attractive compared to fixed income
    alternatives.
