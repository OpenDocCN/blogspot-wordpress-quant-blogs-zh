- en: Wiley has recently published an interested [book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Agile-Contracts-Successful-Engineering-Management-ebook/dp/B00CEVO874)
    on Agile Contracts.   The book starts to get interesting in chapter 3.  Essentially,
    an agile fixed-price contract defines a contractual framework within which time
    and costs are agreed prior to the contract starting, coupled with a structured
    approach to keep the scope within boundaries, leverage process to define and control
    the two parties.

    epic backlog, indicative fixed-price range, riskshare, scope/expense management
    and motivational/cooperative model

- en: Scope governance process (page 67) offers some thoughts around security limit
    breaches for stories, and how they can be handled.  Specifically, if the fixed
    price backlog says a story is 15 points, and the story look to exceed 15 points
    once both parties are into the fixed-price contract, both parties need a process
    to follow to either decide to continue with the larger story than estimated, or
    reduce the story to allow business ROI delivery.

- en: “Sample of an Agile Fixed-Price Contract” chapter 4, offer what it says it does
    🙂  Page 108, offer an interesting view on “Test Coverage” from a perspective of
    unit test coverage.   I’d personally prefer to not only just look at unit test
    coverage, but the Acceptance Criteria/Test coverage as per my posting on Story
    Specification – Acceptance Criteria “Done”.
