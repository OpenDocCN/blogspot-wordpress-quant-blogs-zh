- en: '*The US Navy confronts the PLAN (People''s Liberation Army Navy) in the South
    China Sea. Someone miscalculates and shooting starts and the situation escalates
    wildly. Eventually, there are three American carrier task forces, accompanied
    by submarines, along with the fleets of Asian allies like the Philippines, Japan,
    Australia and so on, in the area.**Just as PLAN forces are outnumbered and the
    Chinese tactical situation look hopeless, the PBoC picks up the phone to New York,
    "I have $1 trillion in Treasury assets to sell - now." The theory is, some Americans
    may be patriotic willing to die for their country, but how many would be willing
    to lose their homes for their country? How about losing their jobs for their country?*'
