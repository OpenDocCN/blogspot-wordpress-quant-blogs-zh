# Magmasystems Blog: Tibco EMS and WCF

> 来源：[http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2008/05/tibco-ems-and-wcf.html#0001-01-01](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2008/05/tibco-ems-and-wcf.html#0001-01-01)

It looks like Tibco is about to announce WCF support for EMS.

Now, *this* is truly exciting news!

Our framework has an entire hand-written communications layer that allows us to communicate over TCP/IP, EMS, various market data systems, MSMQ, etc. We would like nothing more that to gut this layer and replace it with WCF. The missing ingredient has always been EMS support. Now, hopefully, this will be rectified, and hopefully Tibco will offer it to existing EMS customers at no charge.
