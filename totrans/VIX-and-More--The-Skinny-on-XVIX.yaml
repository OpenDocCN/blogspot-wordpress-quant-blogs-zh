    that have been launched in the past few months, the one I find most intriguing
    is the [UBS E-TRACS Daily Long-Short VIX ETN](http://www.ibb.ubs.com/mc/etracs_US/vix_longshort.shtml),
    which I prefer to refer to by its ticker symbol [XVIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XVIX).

    Return Index with a 50% short position in the S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Excess
    Return Index. It is therefore the functional equivalent of a position consisting
    of two units long [VXZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXZ) and one
    unit short [VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX). This combined
    long-short position nets out with very little exposure to volatility in most market
    conditions. Instead, XVIX is almost entirely a [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures)
    [term structure](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/term%20structure)/[contango](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/contango)
    play that increases in value when the slope of the VIX futures term structure
    is upward and/or getting steeper. On the other hand, XVIX comes under the most
    pressure when the slope of the VIX futures term structure is flattening or becoming
    downward sloping (i.e., entering into [backwardation](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/backwardation).)

    put XVIX under a microscope in [De-constructing XVIX](http://onlyvix.blogspot.com/2011/01/de-constructing-xvix.html)
    and explored the historical data and the appeal of the 2:1 long-short ratio vis-à-vis
    a number of alternative ratios.

- en: As I see it, XVIX is almost a pure play on the VIX futures term structure. The
    historical data provided by UBS and analyzed in some detail by Volatility Futures
    & Options shows annual returns in the 10-25% range prior to 2010, with a maximum
    drawdown in the 10-15% range. Last year has to be considered an outlier, as the
    mean daily contango as calculated by my proprietary [VIX Futures Contango Index](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20Futures%20Contango%20Index)
    was 79, a huge premium over the lifetime average reading of 50 for this index.
    Not only was contango extreme in 2010, but it was also increasing for the majority
    of the year.

    in XVIX is not likely to be repeated any time soon. Over the long term, I expect
    XVIX to revert to annual returns in the 10-25% range. In the short-term, however,
    there may be some more significant bumps in the road as the VIX futures term structure
    unwinds some of its extreme contango and returns to a more consistently flat term
    structure.
