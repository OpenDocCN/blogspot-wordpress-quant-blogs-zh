    intensive calibrations that can run for many days or weeks on a multi-cpu box.
    Fortunately the problem lends itself to massive parallelism.

    thousand boxes on one of the grids for a few hours. How much would that cost?

- en: Commercial Grids So I investigated Amazon EC2 and the Google app engine. Of
    the two only Amazon looked to have higher performance servers available. Going
    through the cost math for both Amazon and Google revealed that neither of these
    platforms is costed in a reasonable way for HPC.

- en: Amazon charges 0.80 cents per compute hour, $580 / month or $7000 / compute
    year on one of their “extra-large high cpu” boxes. This configuration of box is
    a 2007 spec Opteron or Xeon. This would imply a dual Xeon X5300 family 8 core
    with a SPECfprate of 66, at best. $7000 per compute year is much too dear, certainly
    there are cheaper options.

- en: Hosting Services It turns out that there are some inexpensive hosting services
    that can provide SPECfprate ~70 machines for around $150 / month. That works out
    to $1800 / year. Not bad, but can we do better?

- en: Just How Expensive Is One of these “High Spec” boxes? The high-end MacPro 8
    core X5570 based box is the least expensive high-end Xeon based server . It does
    not, however, offer the most !/$ if your computation can be distributed. The X5500
    family performs at 140-180 SPECfprates, at a cost of > $2000 just for the 2 CPUs.

- en: There is a new kid on the block, the Core i7 family. The Core i7 920, priced
    at $230 generates ~80 SPECfprates and can be overclocked to around 100\. A barebones
    compute box can be built for around $550\. I could build 2 of these and surpass
    the performance of a dual cpu X5500 system, saving $2000 (given that the least
    expensive such X5500 system is ~$3000).
