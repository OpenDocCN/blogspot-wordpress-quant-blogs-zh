    up article was backtested by Corey Rittenhouse on his new site: [http://www.catallacticanalysis.com/](http://www.catallacticanalysis.com/).
    Corey has managed to create a streamlined and concise reporting system through
    his own programming platform. His work is accurate, and the reports are very detailed.
    Nice work Corey!'

  zh: Corey Rittenhouse在他的新网站：[http://www.catallacticanalysis.com/](http://www.catallacticanalysis.com/)上对之前追踪文章中提出的相对强势建议进行了反向测试。Corey通过自己的编程平台成功创建了一种简化而简洁的报告系统。他的工作准确无误，报告非常详细。干得好，Corey！
- en: The backtest involved selecting the top 6 markets by 1-year relative strength
    (1-year price performance) over the past year or the worst 3 markets by 3-year
    relative strength (3-year price performance). Instead of taking all signals as
    they occured, you would simply take signals only from markets that were in the
    top 9 by this criteria. This means that you would be holding cash more frequently.
    Note that this is NOT the same as the proposed Relative Strength using Donchian
    Channels which essentially made every market a ratio to the S&P500 to track breakouts.
    It is also NOT the same as the previous post on RSM (relative strength by market). The
    results are very good on a risk-adjusted basis–superior to the original Percent
    Exposure Donchian Channel System. In the future, Corey will try to test some more
    of these Quick Take ideas so that readers have a better sense of whether it is
    worthwhile to pursue extensive testing or development on the topic.

  zh: 过去一年内，我们对过去一年价格表现（相对强势）排名前6的市场进行了反向测试，或者对过去三年价格表现（相对强势）排名最差的3个市场进行了反向测试。与其根据信号的发生情况来执行所有信号，不如只在符合此标准的市场中执行信号。这意味着你会更频繁地持有现金。请注意，这与使用唐奇安通道提议的相对强势不同，后者基本上将每个市场与标普500成比例以跟踪突破。这也不同于之前关于RSM（市场相对强度）的帖子。从风险调整的角度来看，结果非常不错——优于最初的百分比暴露唐奇安通道系统。未来，Corey将尝试测试一些更多的这些“快速想法”，以便读者更好地了解是否值得在这个主题上进行广泛测试或开发。
