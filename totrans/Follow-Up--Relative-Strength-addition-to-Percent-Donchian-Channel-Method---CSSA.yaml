    up article was backtested by Corey Rittenhouse on his new site: [http://www.catallacticanalysis.com/](http://www.catallacticanalysis.com/).
    Corey has managed to create a streamlined and concise reporting system through
    his own programming platform. His work is accurate, and the reports are very detailed.
    Nice work Corey!'

- en: The backtest involved selecting the top 6 markets by 1-year relative strength
    (1-year price performance) over the past year or the worst 3 markets by 3-year
    relative strength (3-year price performance). Instead of taking all signals as
    they occured, you would simply take signals only from markets that were in the
    top 9 by this criteria. This means that you would be holding cash more frequently.
    Note that this is NOT the same as the proposed Relative Strength using Donchian
    Channels which essentially made every market a ratio to the S&P500 to track breakouts.
    It is also NOT the same as the previous post on RSM (relative strength by market). The
    results are very good on a risk-adjusted basis–superior to the original Percent
    Exposure Donchian Channel System. In the future, Corey will try to test some more
    of these Quick Take ideas so that readers have a better sense of whether it is
    worthwhile to pursue extensive testing or development on the topic.
