- en: In Wednesday’s post, [Kafka, Surrealism and Trading](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/09/kafka-surrealism-and-trading.html),
    I talked about the importance of getting out of one’s comfort zone in order to
    enhance trading. One reader expressed concern that that pushing the envelope too
    far and straying from one’s comfort zone was an excellent way to learn some expensive
    lessons and potentially an approach that invites disaster.

    company as a metaphor for trading and specifically for [trading strategy](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/trading%20strategies)
    development. A biotechnology firm manages a pipeline of drugs in development and
    in many cases, also has drugs on the market that are generating revenue. Think
    of the drugs in the pipeline as analogous to investment ideas that the trader
    is still incubating, testing and deciding whether or not they have sufficient
    potential to warrant implementing with trading capital.

  zh: 考虑将生物技术公司作为交易和特别是交易策略开发的隐喻。生物技术公司管理着处于开发阶段的药物管线，在许多情况下，还拥有在市场上产生收入的药物。将管线中的药物视为与交易者仍在孵化、测试并决定是否足以用交易资本实施的交易想法相似。
- en: For drugs in the pipeline, there are various stages of development before the
    drugs are tested for efficacy and side effects. As drugs progress through the
    pipeline, they go through internal gated approval processes known formally as
    Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 and eventually through an FDA final approval process
    that determines whether the drug can be sold to the public. Only a small percentage
    (approximately 8%) of potential new drug ideas make into pre-clinical trials and
    less than 1% are deemed sufficient to warrant the investment associated with Phase
    1 trials. As drugs encounter the gated approval process at the end of each trial
    phase, the number of high potential candidates is continually winnowed down, as
    issues related to efficacy or side effects are subjected to rigorous statistical
    analysis. As these drugs advance through the pipeline, the financial investment
    increases substantially. Ultimately, only about 1 in 10,000 of the original drugs
    involved in the drug discovery process makes it all the way through to FDA approval
    and ends up on the market. On average, the process takes about ten years.

  zh: 对于处于研发阶段的药物，在药物被测试有效性和副作用之前，需要经历各种开发阶段。随着药物沿着研发管线进展，它们要通过正式称为第一阶段、第二阶段和第三阶段的内部审批流程，最终通过FDA的最终审批流程，确定药物是否可以向公众销售。只有很小一部分（大约8%）的潜在新药想法能够进入前期临床试验，不到1%的药物被认为足够值得进行第一阶段试验所需的投入。随着药物在每个试验阶段的末端遇到审批流程，具有高潜力的候选药物数量不断减少，因为与有效性或副作用相关的问题要受到严格的统计分析。随着这些药物沿着研发管线进展，财务投资显著增加。最终，大约只有1/10,000的原始药物能够一路进展到FDA批准，并最终上市。平均而言，整个过程需要大约十年时间。
- en: Investors should look at their investment ideas and strategies as a pipeline
    management process too. There is limited capital available and only the best strategies
    should be funded. At the beginning of the pipeline, investors should focus the
    most attention on getting out of their comfort zone, formulating wild new trading
    ideas and translating these into actionable strategies. This is the best time
    to get out of one’s comfort zone and embrace some chaos. As the ideas then progress
    through some sort of internal approval process, then focus become more important.
    Is the idea robust? Can the idea be translated into effective strategies? Is there
    enough liquidity to implement these strategies? What will the slippage costs be?
    What do the initial backtesting results show in terms of potential? Etc.

  zh: 投资者应该将他们的投资想法和策略也看作是一个管道管理过程。有限的资本可供使用，只有最好的策略才应该得到资助。在管道的最初阶段，投资者应该最关注的是走出他们的舒适区，制定大胆的新交易想法，并将这些想法转化为可操作的策略。这是离开舒适区，拥抱一些混乱的最佳时机。当这些想法经过某种内部审批流程后，关注点就变得更加重要了。这个想法健壮吗？这个想法可以转化为有效的策略吗？有足够的流动性来实施这些策略吗？滑点成本会是多少？初步回测结果在潜力方面显示了什么？等等。
- en: As new ideas progress through an internal approval process, the trader should
    move from an area of discomfort to an area of extreme comfort. By the time a trading
    strategy is ready to be deployed, the trader’s mind set should have evolved from
    one of high chaos and low comfort to low/no chaos and high comfort. A corollary
    of the trading idea development process, which I have sketched out in the graphic
    below, is that the more one is able to get out of their comfort zone at the beginning
    of the trading idea pipeline, the better the trading results and the more likely
    there will be uncorrelated strategies when the chaos of idea generation is translated
    into focused strategies.

  zh: 当新的想法通过内部审批流程时，交易员应该从不适区域转移到极度舒适区域。等到一个交易策略准备部署时，交易员的心态应该已经从高混乱低舒适转变为低/无混乱高舒适。我在下面的图表中概述的交易想法开发过程的一个推论是，如果一个人在交易想法管道的最初阶段能够更好地离开他们的舒适区，那么交易结果会更好，当想法生成的混乱被转化为关注策略时，更有可能出现不相关的策略。
