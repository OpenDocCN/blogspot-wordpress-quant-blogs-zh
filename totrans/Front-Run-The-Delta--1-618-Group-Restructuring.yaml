- en: 1.618 Group is going through a restructuring that will result in a significant
    change to its core trading business. The company has closed outstanding positions
    and its participation in energy markets going forward will be greatly reduced.
    1.618 Group will remain in operation but will be refocusing its business and trading
    efforts. Renovatio will remain an active participant in energy markets.
