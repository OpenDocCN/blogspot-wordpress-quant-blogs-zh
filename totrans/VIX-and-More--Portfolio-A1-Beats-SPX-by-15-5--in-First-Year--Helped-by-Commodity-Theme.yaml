    in agriculture and energy, the commodities theme has been good to Portfolio A1.  [W&T
    Offshore (WTI)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=wti), the oil and gas exploration
    and production company, is now up 15.4% in the two weeks it has been in the portfolio.  Last
    week’s biggest winner was [Terra Industries (TRA)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=tra),
    which posted a 10% gain for the week, moving up with the red-hot nitrogen fertilizer
    space.'

    Portfolio A1 officially goes in the books with a return of +8.23%, compared to
    a -7.25% move in the benchmark S&P 500 index over the same period, a net performance
    gain of 15.48% by the portfolio over the benchmark.

    A1 has had an average [beta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_coefficient) of
    1.48 and an impressive annualized [alpha](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_coefficient)
    of 23.58% during the first year that the portfolio has been up and running.

- en: In many respects, this portfolio was established to provided focused approach
    to "fishing for whales." That approach has been largely successful if a little
    inconsistent during the first year, landing such strong momentum stocks as of
    [MOS](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=mos), [DRYS](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=drys),
    [TEX](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=tex), [PBR](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=pbr),
    [RIO](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=rio) and others. Part of what makes
    finding so many big winners possible is a very high annual turnover. At 674%,
    this is clearly a trading portfolio, not a buy and hold approach. Losses are generally
    cut quickly and a new hook goes over the transom almost every week. I look forward
    to seeing how the portfolio fares in the second year, as we begin that year with
    what looks to be an extremely challenging investment environment.
