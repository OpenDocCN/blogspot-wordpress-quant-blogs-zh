    conceptualize important points and gives us a general framework for understanding
    the world. But we should also be aware of the weaknesses embedded in many of these
    models because many of these models are simplified to the point that they are
    misleading. And ***this stems from another big problem revolving around the way
    many economists obsess over mathematics***.

    They inadvertently drop large numbers of observations by including a variable,
    such as spouse's hours of work, which is missing for over half their sample. They
    include every single observation in their data set, even when it makes no sense
    to do so. For example, individuals who are below the legal driving age might be
    included in a regression that is trying to predict who talks on the cell phone
    while driving. People create specification bias by failing to control for variables
    which are almost certainly going to matter in their analysis, like the presence
    of children or marital status.

    or the god of econometrics would smite them down, if they were to try to explain
    a 0-1 dependent variable by running an ordinary least squares regression.

    You can run logit or probit if you want, but run a linear probability model as
    well, so I can tell whether or not anything weird is going on with the regression."

    spot an obviously endogenous regressor, and figure out which explanatory variables
    to include in their model, then it might be worth having a conversation about
    the relative merits of probit and linear probability models. Until then, I'm telling

    "robust" at the end of it.

    not all - econometrics classes emphasize statistical theory. Students might run

    When every student downloads his own data, works on his own unique problem, and
    specifies a novel and original model, each student will need a lot of individual
    help and attention. The marking cannot be delegated to a TA, because each research
    question, and each data set, is different, so it is impossible to write down a
    simple answer key. But spending hours upon hours reading students'' first struggling
    steps at regression analysis is a huge amount of work. It''s so much easier to
    mark a final exam consisting of calculations, short answer questions, and replication
    of theorems.'

    low or negative working capital doesn’t score well on Altman Z but some industries
    can operate with zero or negative working capital. For example, a restaurant gets
    paid in cash, but their suppliers will generally give them net 30 on their payables

    to different measures of solvency, such as working capital adequacy, EBIT margin,
    turnover, etc. The weights appeared to have been optimized for operating companies
    in manufacturing or distribution. Do those weights make sense for a bank? If an
    analyst had spent just a few minutes thinking about the underlying assumptions
    of Altman Z; how it relates to the business model of a typical manufacturer and
    then thought about the business model of a bank; he would instantly have the answer.
