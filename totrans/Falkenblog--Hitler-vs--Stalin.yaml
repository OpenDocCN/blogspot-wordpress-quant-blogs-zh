- en: 'Ms. Kessler-Harris''s defense of Hellman and others who refused to abjure Stalinism
    will sound familiar. While some party apparatchiks were "vaguely aware in the
    1930s of Stalin''s increasingly ruthless methods"—a rather limp way of describing
    a roiling genocide—one must remember that "this was, after all, a period when
    rumors flew." Soviet enthusiasts like Hellman, Ms. Kessler-Harris writes, were
    merely showing a commitment to "social justice" and not Stalinism per se. The
    Communist Party plumped for the noble goals of racial equality and a vaguely defined
    "peace," leading Ms. Kessler-Harris to ask: "How could [Hellman] not have joined?"'

    when they see a greater good, as illustrated not merely by Hellman's life, but
    by her sympathetic biographer. Note that Ezra Pound and Martin Heidegger are generally
    consider morally bankrupt for embracing fascism, which to me isn't worse than
    whatever you want to call what Stalin and Mao were doing. White lies have their
    place, but not for big intellectual debates like the viability of socialism.
