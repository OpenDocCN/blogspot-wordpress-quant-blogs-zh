  zh: 连续29年收盘上涨是相当惊人的。同样令人震惊的是，这种看似的优势突然消失了。我无法解释为什么会有这种变化，但显然它已经改变了。
- en: And that is something we always need to keep in mind. The market is constantly
    changing. It is important to always keep studying it, keep an open mind, and adapt
    as it evolves. Best to all in 2013! I hope it is a prosperous year for you and
    I hope Quantifiable Edges proves helpful along the way!
