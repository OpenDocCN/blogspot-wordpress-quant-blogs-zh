- en: The International Securities Exchange ([ISE](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/ISE)),
    which publishes a superb [implied volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/implied%20volatility)
    chart that I have featured on *VIX and More* on a number of occasions, has recently
    launched an [enhanced version of their IV chart](http://www.ise.com/WebForm/md_livevol.aspx?categoryId=124&header3=true&menu1=true).
    The new version of this chart, which I have appended below, adds an “ISEE value”
    to the list of data. I have discussed the [ISEE](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/ISEE)
    call to put ratio frequently in this space in the past. In this incarnation it
    is simply a ratio of call volume to put volume for the specified security.

    example security because all eyes should be on this bank, which is now trading
    at a 14 year low after hitting 3.57 earlier this morning. If Citigroup crumbles,
    it will dwarf the chaos created by [AIG](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/AIG)
    and Lehman Brothers.
