- en: The demand shock was in the form of a loss of demand as lockdown and stay-at-home
    orders cratered demand. Governments around the world acted to cushion some of
    the demand shock by way of fiscal support. In the US, a significant part of the
    fiscal cushion is expiring, which is the risk of a double-dip slowdown.
