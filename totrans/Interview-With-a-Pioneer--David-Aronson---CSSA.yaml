- en: David Aronson is considered by many serious quants to be one of the first authors
    to seriously address the subject of data-mining bias in trading system development.
    His popular book “[Evidence-Based Technical Analysis](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470008741/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0470008741&linkCode=as2&tag=cssa01-20&linkId=XMGAPMV5ZQ2YPQFY%22>Evidence-Based%20Technical%20Analysis:%20Applying%20the%20Scientific%20Method%20and%20Statistical%20Inference%20to%20Trading%20Signals</a><img%20src=%22http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=cssa01-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0470008741)”
    is a must read for system developers. One of the interesting things that most
    people do not know is that David was a pioneer in the use of machine-learning
    in financial markets going back over four decades. Over that time he has become an
    expert in developing predictive models using trading indicators.

    as a companion to the [TSSB software](http://www.tssbsoftware.com/) that implements
    all of the applications found in the book. The TSSB software is incredibly powerful
    and the book does a good job of explaining the myriad of applications that are
    possible.  After reading the book, it became readily apparent that this software
    was the product of hundreds or even thousands of hours of very meticulous work
    that could only be shaped by a lifetime of experience working with machine-learning. I
    had a chance to speak with David recently at length to discuss a variety of different
    topics:'

- en: The initial purpose for creating TSSB was as internal software for Hood River
    Research in our consulting work in applying predictive analytics to financial
    markets. The bulk of our consulting work has been developing performance boosting
    signal filters to existing trading systems. There was no software available  that
    dealt successfully with data manning bias and over fitting problems associated
    with the application of machine learning to financial market data.  We decided
    to sell a guided tutorial for its use (Statistically Sound Machine Learning for
    Algorithmic Trading of Financial Instruments) to raise funds for its additional
    development.  TSSB is made available for free.

- en: I started as a stock broker with Merrill lynch in the 70’s. I wanted to promote
    the money management services of a Netcom a CTA—but Merill wouldn’t permit that
    at the time. So I left to go out on my own and began analyzing the performance
    of all CTAs registered with the CFTC as of 1978.  I started reading about statistical
    pattern recognition (what is now known as predictive analytics) after a prospect
    of mine from the aerospace industry suggested it might be valuable to apply to
    financial markets. Only two CTAs in my survey were using such methods- and so
    I thought there would be an edge to trading systems based on this approach. But
    in the late 1970’s affordable computers at the time were not quite up to the task.
    A precursor to Hood River Research was Raden Research Group. We developed an early
    predictive analytics platform for financial market data software called Prism.
    The software used a machine learning technique called kernel regression (GRNN)
    and this predated the use of neural networks and the publication of papers on
    neural nets in the 1980’s. However, like NN, some of the early methods had the
    problem of over-fitting the data—and few appreciated the statistical inference
    issues involved.  Later I joined forces with Dr. Timothy Masters who is a statistician
    and TSSB was developed.

    or theoretical standpoint?**'

- en: The quality of the indicators uses as inputs to a predictive model or a trading
    system are very important. Even the best conventional technical indicators have
    only small amount predictive information. The vast majority is noise. Thus the
    task is to model that tiny amount of useful information in each indicator and
    it with useful information in other indicators.  Rules defined by a human analyst
    often miss potentially useful but subtle information.

- en: Consistency is also an issue—experts are not consistent in their interpretation
    of multi-variable data even when presented with the exact same information on
    separate occasions.  Models, however they are developed are, by definition,  always
    consistent. I would also highlight that there is ample peer-reviewed research
    demonstrating that humans lack the configural thinking abilities needed to integrate
    multiple variables simultaneously, except under the most ideal conditions.  In
    contrast this is a task that is easily handled by quantitative models.

    of identifying potentially profitable technical trading rules using conventional
    or even state of the art statistical significance tests alone?**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Standard statistical significance tests are fine when evaluating a single hypothesis. 
    In the context of developing a trading system this would be the case when the
    developer predefines all indicators parameter values, rules, etc. and this is
    never tweaked and retested.  The challenge lies with trying to evaluate trading
    systems “discovered” after many variants of the system have been tested and best
    performing one is selected.  This search, often called data mining renders standard
    significance tests useless.  Data mining is not a bad thing, in and of itself. 
    We all do it either manually or in an automated fashion.  The error is in failing
    to realize that specialized evaluation methods are required.

- en: Another issue worth pointing out that standard predictive modeling methods are
    guided by a criterion based on minimizing prediction errors, such as mean squared
    error and these are not optimal for predictive modes intended to be used for trading
    financial markets.  It is possible for a model to have poor error reduction across
    the entire range of its forecasts while being profitable for trading because when
    its forecasts are extreme they carry useful information.  It is more appropriate
    to use financial measures such as the profit factor which are all included as
    objective functions within TSSB.

- en: Yet a 3^(rd) issue is the multiple hypothesis problem is encountered when building
    systems. Typically there is a search for the best indicators from an initial large
    set of candidates, a search for the best values of various tuning parameters,
    perhaps even a search for the best systems to include in a portfolio of trading
    systems. These searches are typically conducted via guided search where what is
    learned at step N is used to guide what is searched at step N+1.  Standard approaches
    to this problem  such as  White’s Reality Check and the one I discussed in Evidence
    Based Technical Analysis (Wiley 2006) fail for guided search.  Genetic algorithms
    and genetic programming, in fact all forms of machine learning that build multi-indicator
    trading systems use guided search.  One of the unique features of the TSSB software
    is that we have Permutation Training that does work for guided search machine
    learning.

- en: Now that the statistical tools are so easy to use and there is so much free
    code (ie R etc) there is a lot of over-fitting and a lot of backtests that look
    great but don’t generalize on out-of-sample data going forward. Because empirical
    research on financial market data has only one set of historical data, and it
    is easy to abuse almost any type of methodology including walk-forward. Assuming
    that you use software such as TSSB it is easier to avoid these issues. That said,
    there is no substitute for common sense or logic in selecting indicators to use
    or building intelligent model architecture. In my opinion, the way to differentiate
    or uncover real opportunities currently lie in the clever engineering of new features-
     such as better indicators.

- en: Many of the indicators included in the TSSB indicator library, which number
    over 100, have been transformed or re-scaled for consistency across markets. 
    This is crucial for cross-sectional analysis. Some utilize non-linear fitting
    methods on the underlying variables to produce unique outputs. We have also included
    a wide variety of unique indicators like Morlet wavelets, some proprietary third-party
    indicators such as FTI (Follow-Through-Index developed by Khalsa), as well as
    some indicators that we have seen published like the financial turbulence indicator
    by Kritzman that we found to be unique or valuable.
