    strong resistance at 1100 and strong support just above 1040\. Assuming these
    support and resistance levels can hold up for another three weeks – and that is
    admittedly a large assumption – then the current market environment sets up nicely
    for what I like to call “strangle pong” with November SPX options. Essentially,
    this is an approach where one assumes range-bound trading and sells near-the-money
    options when the underlying approaches one end or the other of the trading range.

    it involves dividing the trading range into three zones (which do not have to
    be of equal size, they just happen to be in the diagram): an upper end of the
    trading range in which one sells calls; a lower end of the trading range in which
    one sells puts; and a neutral zone near the middle of the range in which one takes
    no action (or perhaps sells both puts and calls.)'

    resistance just like the [pioneering computer game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong)
    and the options seller captures a high premium each time the underlying approaches
    the end of the range. Once both puts and calls have been sold, a [strangle](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/strangle)
    is established, with the maximum profit and loss zone being defined by the target
    trading range.

    range of the underlying during the life of the trade. Of secondary importance
    is the volatility of the underlying, where increased volatility will increase
    the price of the options sold and work against the options seller. This is a position’s

    address in future posts.

    of which is to “buy the wings” (offsetting long put positions below SPX 1040 and
    offsetting long call positions above 1100) and convert this position into an iron
    [condor](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/condor). According to the
    strangle pong approach, right now, with the SPX trading a little below 1050, would
    be a good time to initiate the first leg of this trade by shorting some SPX 1040
    puts. Let’s see how the market moves in the next week or so; I will revisit this
    strangle pong trading approach at that time.
