    reader asked about how to get up and running with sentiment indicators, where
    to get data, what time frames to use, etc.  Since this is not a subject I have
    broached here, let me use this opportunity to provide an initial overview of some
    of my thoughts on sentiment indicators.'

- en: In terms of context, I consider fundamental analysis, technical analysis and
    market sentiment analysis to be the three primary legs of the investment stool.  I
    believe it is a common pattern for relative newcomers to the investing world to
    begin with a fundamental analysis perspective, start wondering why individual
    stock don’t move ‘like they should,’ then add some technical analysis tools.  Often
    it takes awhile to get the hang of TA; once they do, most investors get blindsided
    when thee entire forest moves abruptly while they are focusing on an individual
    tree or two.  This is often the catalyst that leads to a more in-depth examination
    of market sentiment indicators.

    keep in mind that much of market sentiment is a contrarian tool.  One of my favorite
    quotes comes from John Bender in Jack Schwager’s *[Stock Market Wizards](http://www.amazon.com/Stock-Market-Wizards-Interviews-Americas/dp/0066620589)*,
    “It’s not the current opinion on the stock that matters, but rather the potential
    change in the opinion that matters.”  When your great aunt, housekeeper and taxi
    driver all start telling you how much money they are making in the stock market,
    who is left to buy and drive prices up further?  On the other hand, if most of
    the people you know confess to having recently lost over half of their money in
    the market and swear about “never investing in stocks again,” then the markets
    have probably just about run out of sellers.

    and consider how much easy money you could make by taking the other side of every
    trade that a novice investor makes.

    investors are thinking, feeling and doing, then encourage you to take the opposite
    position when their fear or greed reaches extreme levels.
  prefs: []

- en: Some sentiment indicators are compiled based on a direct survey of investors
    to determine if they are bullish or bearish.  Three of the more famous of these
    are [Investors Intelligence](http://www.market-harmonics.com/free-charts/sentiment/investors_intelligence.htm),
    the [American Association of Individual Investors](http://www.investmenttools.com/equities/weekly/aaii_bullish___bearish_percent.htm)
    (AAII) and [Market Vane](http://www.investmenttools.com/equities/weekly/market_vane_bullish__.htm).  Newer
    additions to the fold are [Birinyi’s Blogger Sentiment Poll](http://tickersense.typepad.com/ticker_sense/blogger_sentiment_poll/index.html)
    and [LowRisk.com’s Investor Sentiment Indicator](http://www.lowrisk.com/sentiment.htm).  Since
    we know that what some people say and actually do are often two very different
    things, much of sentiment analysis looks at the activity of supposedly unsophisticated
    investors in order to get a better sense of which direction they are leaning.  The
    [ISEE](http://www.iseoptions.com/marketplace/statistics/sentiment_index.asp) (call
    to put ratio) is one such measure of investor activity; the [CBOE Equity put to
    call ratio](http://stockcharts.com/charts/gallery.html?%24cpce) is another; and
    the [Public Short Sales data](http://www.investmenttools.com/thefed/public_short_sales.htm)
    is another good data point.  To the extent you are able to, use ratios and other
    tools to compare and contrast the actions of the ‘little guy’ with that of institutions.

    (and free) [Market Summary](http://stockcharts.com/def/servlet/Favorites.CServlet?obj=msummary&cmd=show,iday%5bY%5d&disp=SXA)
    page that is an excellent snapshot of what is going on in the 100+ most important
    markets, sectors, countries, etc. Scroll down to the bottom two groups and you'll
    find many sentiment indicators I follow in the "Market Breadth" section. You may
    or may not already be familiar with the "Bullish Percent Indices" – if you aren't,
    these are something you should take some time to educate yourself on in the future.
    Each indicator has links to three kinds of charts – and if you click directly
    on the name of the indicator, you will pull up the default gallery view.

    at [Market Gauge - Today's Indicators](http://tal.marketgauge.com/dvMGPro/gauges/TodaysGauges.asp).
    I keep an eye on the “Contrary Opinion” data, in particular. Note that each line
    has a chart link in the far right hand side of the page. You may want to also
    bookmark [Market Gauge's Market Summary page](http://tal.marketgauge.com/dvMGPro/mktsummary/MarketSummary.asp).  Finally,
    I only recently discovered [InvestmentTools.com](http://www.investmenttools.com/),
    which has some superb “[Weekly Sentiment Indicators](http://www.investmenttools.com/equities/)”
    as well as some valuable “[Short Sales](http://www.investmenttools.com/thefed/)”

    (consider the "Volume" and "Momentum" data at some point in the future too) and
    the ["Power Tools" at SchaeffersResearch.com](http://www.schaeffersresearch.com/streetools/filters/inv_int.aspx).
    Once again, start with the “Sentiment Data” section, but eventually look at the
    others as well. In terms of blog sources, [HeadlineCharts](http://headlinecharts.blog.com/)
    probably does more with market sentiment than any of the others I read and [TheSentimentals.com](http://thesentimentals.com/)
    has as comprehensive a list of links to market sentiment data as I have seen.
    For a weekly recap of sentiment data and a commentary on what is happening in
    the world of sentiment and market internals, check out Fred Ruffy's "[Sentiment
    Journal](http://www.optionetics.com/market/articles/default.asp?keyword=Sentiment+Journal&mode=title&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;x=12&y=17&symbol=Enter+Symbol...)"

    and [CBOE VIX data](http://www.cboe.com/micro/vix/historical.aspx) and [CBOE Put/Call
    ratio data](http://www.cboe.com/data/PutCallRatio.aspx) from the CBOE. You can
    download historical data from Yahoo in spreadsheet format [for the likes of the
    VIX](http://finance.yahoo.com/q/hp?s=%5EVIX) and many other indices. As a rule,
    you should try to get this same data from an exchange or web site dedicated to
    this index first and use Yahoo only as a last resort.

    you look at. Are most of your trades day trades? swing trades of 2-10 days? have
    holding periods of 1-3 months? Maybe you trade in multiple time frames (dangerous
    and confusing at times, but ultimately not necessarily a bad thing to do.)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I have never seen anyone articulate this, but my personal experience is that
    the charting time horizon for support, resistance, moving averages, recognition
    of common patterns, etc. ought to be something on the order of 20-50x your typical
    holding period. Most of my trades are of the 2-10 day variety, so most of the
    charts I look at are in the 20 day to 1 year range. I like to look at charts of
    2 years or more for historical perspective on candidates I have already screened
    and I sometimes to go down as low as 1 minute bars for intra-day charts to fine
    tune entries and exits, but for the most part, I live in the 1-6 month charting
    world. Typically the longer term charts identify the opportunity and the shorter
    term charts trigger the timing of the entry.
  prefs: []

- en: I rarely care much about intra-day sentiment and look at a lot of moving averages
    in the 5, 10 and 20 day range, sometimes up to 200 days/40 weeks. Your sentiment
    time horizon should probably match your overall charting time horizon, but I haven't
    found much bang for my energy/attention buck focusing on intra-day or even day
    to day sentiment movement. Look for some smoothing factor, such as simple or exponential
    moving averages, to help minimize the noise.

    was about 9 months ago. I need to update that list and put it on the blog, but
    I can tell you that there is not a great book on investor sentiment in there.
    Gary Smith’s [How I Trade for a Living](http://www.amazon.com/Trade-Living-Wiley-Online-Trading/dp/0471355143)
    is probably my favorite treatment of market sentiment.  Though it is not on the
    above list, I thought Toni Turner did an excellent job with sentiment and many
    other topics in [Short-Term Trading in the New Stock Market](http://www.amazon.com/Short-Term-Trading-New-Stock-Market/dp/031232569X).
    For my money, Turner’s book is one of the better ones for a relative newbie, albeit
    with a definite short-term bias. Two other books worth checking out for their
    discussion of sentiment issues are Martin Pring''s encyclopedic [Technical Analysis
    Explained: The Successful Investor''s Guide to Spotting Investment Trends and
    Turning Points](http://www.amazon.com/Technical-Analysis-Explained-Successful-Investment/dp/0071381937/ref=sr_1_2/103-0088821-7291048?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1175374874&sr=1-2)
