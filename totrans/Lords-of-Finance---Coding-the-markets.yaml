- en: Got a copy of [Lords of Finance](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Lords-Finance-Great-Depression-Bankers/dp/0434015415)
    as a birthday present at the weekend. I’ve been enoying the opening chapters hugely.
    The author, Liaquat Ahmed, has done for financial history what Anthony Beevor
    did for WWII with [Stalingrad](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Stalingrad-Antony-Beevor/dp/0141032405).
    Explication of grand strategy is interwoven with human detail to create narrative
    momentum. Strongly recommended…
