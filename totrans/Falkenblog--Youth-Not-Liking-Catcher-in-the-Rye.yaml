    just better. Shows in the 60s and 70s were linear, with a minor comic subplot
    (think Starsky and Hutch, Dragnet). Today, shows like The Sapranos and Desparate
    Housewives have a multithreaded approach, where characters are much less black
    and white. The net effect is that your average TV watcher is more sophisticated
    that a generation ago, in the same way that New Yorkers were more sophisticated
    than country bumpkins in the 1920s (the term 'corny' relates to the observation
    in the 1920s that rural--corn fed--audiences tended to like trite or overly sentimental
    jokes or scenes, presumably because of their ignorance).

    who are part of an organization (eg, the military, a corporation) with their external
    values, are either deluded or empty and pathetic. This idea has been very damaging,
    as it invites a pointless narcissism, elevating a lack of focus, and instant gratification.

    is both related to the self, and the market, because if you are good at what others
    do not value, it is not good for you. The fact is, happiness and prosperity comes
    from focusing on others, not oneself. Loving a child, a god, serving a customer,
    are all other-directed, and generate a lot of happiness.'

    in the zeitgeist, like when we learned that zero is a number. In the future, perhaps
    people will become sufficiently sophisticated to learn that knowing about the
    major personalities in debates or big organizations--their sexual proclivities,
    drug usage, their family history--is not the same thing as knowing about the ideas
    or organizations.
