- en: I’m reading Zuckerman’s [Greatest Trade Ever](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Greatest-Trade-Ever-Behind-Scenes/dp/0385529910),
    an accout of how John Paulson’s hedge fund profited from the credit crunch. There’s
    a lot of anecdotage and general background. But among all that there’s some good
    detail on implementation. How to implement a view of the markets as a trade is
    a key question for any trader. Drobny’s [House of Money](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Inside-House-Money-Traders-Profiting/dp/047037909X)
    is excellent on this. Zuckerman’s book as some good stuff on why shorting the
    bonds or equity of home loan origination companies didn’t work, why CDSs on sub
    prime MBSs didn’t become tradeable til 2005, and why they were the right vehicle
    for shorting. Also on why using CDSs means negative carry, and why that’s generally
    a difficult thing for any portfolio. Taleb has some good comments on why his out
    the money options strategy suffered from the same problem.
