- en: I presented historical returns following days when there was a strong reaction
    (+1%) to a Fed (pictured at right) announcement. The results showed that the positive
    reaction was typically short-lived. Another highly anticipated Fed announcement
    is due tomorrow. Tonight I thought I’d present historical returns following a
    disappointment (just in case).

- en: As you can see, a strongly negative reaction to a Fed announcement has typically
    been followed by a very positive next two weeks. So…if the Fed does something
    the market “likes” it will go up tomorrow, but over the next two weeks returns
    will likely be disappointing. If the Fed disappoints the market tomorrow we’ll
    see afternoon weakness. This disappointment could lead to a nice rise over the
    next two weeks. So the bulls should want the Fed to upset them tomorrow, and the
    bears should hope for a short-covering rally.

- en: I find these tendencies to be quite interesting. My untested (as of yet) theory
    on why this occurs is that “good” news normally will come in the form of a rate
    cut or other stimulus. This kind of good news happens during times of economic
    and market weakness and the improvement for both can take time. “Bad” or “disappointing”
    news many times will come in the form of tightening. The Fed tightens normally
    when the economy and markets are strong. Just as they can’t fix it in a day, they
    can’t break it in a day either. Their “bad” decision won’t derail a rally right
    away and the market will typically continue to trudge higher for a while.

    in the reaction to the Fed tomorrow. The move likely won’t last longer than a
    day or two before reversing itself.'
