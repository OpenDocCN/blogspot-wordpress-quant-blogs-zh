    high” and the resulting possibility that there was some sort of unseen threat
    to the financial markets that was not showing up on their radar. In the last few
    years, the situation has reversed and now I find investors expressing more concern
    about a low VIX more often than a high VIX. Yes, there are some (many, actually)
    who start to get anxious and fearful when the markets are not reflecting as much
    anxiety and [fear](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/fear) as they think
    they should. For those who still think about the battle scars from [2008](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/2008),
    this phenomenon seems to be a recurring issue.  (See my posts on [disaster imprinting](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/disaster%20imprinting)
    for more information on this.)

    a chart I last presented in October 2012 in [Ratio of VIX to Realized Volatility
    Higher than Any Year Since 1996](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2012/10/ratio-of-vix-to-realized-volatility.html).

    (HV) of the S&P 500 index were are relatively low levels during 2013\. More importantly,
    the VIX maintained an average premium of 34% to the 10-day HV of the SPX during
    the year, which is right in line with historical norms going back to 1990 of a
    premium of about 35%.

    historical norms, I think it is worth noting that from 1990-1996, the VIX typically
    had a much higher premium relative to historical volatility in the SPX than it
    has in more recent years, so whereas the long-term VIX premium to HV stands at
    about 35%, the post-1996 average premium is closer to 26%. As a result, if you
    really need to drive home the point that the VIX was “too low” in 2013, you can
    always trot out the post-1996 data, but otherwise consider the VIX to be just
    about exactly where it should have been – at least in relation to historical volatility
    – during the past year.

    do have a tendency to trend over the course of several years, the ratio of the
    two has a much more random movement and is therefore much more difficult to predict
    for 2014.
