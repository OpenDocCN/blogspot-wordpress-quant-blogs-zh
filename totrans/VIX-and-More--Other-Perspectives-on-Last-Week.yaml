    to rely on those who were plugged in to provide a recap.'

    several of the major indices last week and the put to call numbers were [at extreme
    levels](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/03/put-to-call-data-at-extreme-levels.html)
    all week.  In contrast to the put to call data, the volatility indices were sluggish
    and unremarkable during the week, with the VIX finishing the week up 0.95 (3.6%)
    to 27.49 and the VWSI rising to +1.

    only winning play last week, while the smaller (market cap) and more far flung
    one’s equity positions were, the worse they performed.

    I tried last night: a $6.99 (at Trader Joe’s) [Novella Synergy](http://www.eosvintage.com/winenotes/Nov-04%20Synergy.pdf)
    from [EOS Winery](http://www.eosvintage.com/) in Paso Robles, <state st="on"><place
    st="on">California</place></state>.  This blend changes every year, but the 2005
    version that I tried consists of 46% petite sirah, 33% cabernet sauvignon, 16%
    sangiovese, and 5% petit verdot.  While the combination of petite sirah and cabernet
    sounds like it might make for a heavy, overpowering wine, this is an everyday
    red with much more finesse than I expected.  Food friendly and quaffable on its
    own, this wine is also an excellent change of pace for those stuck in a ‘same
    varietal again’ rut.'
