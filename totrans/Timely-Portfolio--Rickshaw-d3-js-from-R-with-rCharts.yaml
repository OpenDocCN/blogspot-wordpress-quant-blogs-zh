- en: Shutterstock’s open source [Rickshaw](http://code.shutterstock.com/rickshaw)
    provides a [very nice tutorial](http://code.shutterstock.com/rickshaw/tutorial/introduction.html)
    to get started building interactive time series [d3.js](http://d3js.org) charts
    with Rickshaw.  I just could not resist rebuilding the tutorial but this time
    ***ENTIRELY in*** [***R***](http://r-project.or) with the amazing packages [slidify](http://slidify.org)
    and [rCharts](http://github.com/ramnathv/rcharts).  I have embedded the tutorial
    below, but it will probably look much better if you go directly to the [Github
    pages version](http://timelyportfolio.github.io/rCharts_rickshaw_gettingstarted/).

- en: The slidify and rCharts author Ramnath Vaidyanathan has done an incredible job
    and continues to perfect these fine tools.  They completely transformed my workflow
    and output by allowing both dynamic and interactive components that I can combine
    into a beautiful document.  Be sure to see him present to this [NYHackr meetup 
    on June 17, 2013](http://www.meetup.com/nyhackr/events/122192822/).
