    considerable change of focus in the eurozone from the paradigm of all-austerity-all-the-time

    three-month, six-month contracts that may be renewed for years. The same labour
    market is highly inflexible for the protected part of the population where salaries

    a modern twist. Since monetary union began, Germany has had substantial productivity
    gains and only moderate wage increases, making it highly competitive. Eurostat
    reports that German wages rose 2 percent a year from 2000 to 2009, while Spanish
    wages increased by 4.7 percent a year in the same period -- more than twice as
    fast. Because the currencies are the same, Germany’s competitiveness has made
    it tough for Spain and the other weaker states to sell their products in the euro
