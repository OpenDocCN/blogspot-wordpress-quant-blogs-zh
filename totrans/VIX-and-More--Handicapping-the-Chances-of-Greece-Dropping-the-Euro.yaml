    can be a Herculean task, even for the most determined analyst. Heck, even hazarding
    a guess at what tomorrow’s crisis du jour will be is more than enough for most
    investors to grapple with.

    and fickle voters who intend to distort that landscape even more, trying to assign
    probabilities to various scenarios and then divine the implications for Greece’s
    relationship with the [euro](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/euro)
    is sufficiently daunting as to cause many an investor just to park their money
    in cash until the future begins to look a little less murky.

    measures that can serve as a barometer of how bad things are now and are likely
    to become in the future. [Credit default swaps](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/credit%20default%20swaps)
    are an excellent example, as is the [VSTOXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VSTOXX)
    equity volatility index, the euro volatility index ([EVZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EVZ)),
    sovereign debt yields, etc.

    Over the course of its life (which began in November 2007), EVZ has typically
    traded at just a shade over half of the VIX, which is where it closed today. Still,
    while the VIX posted its highest close since January, EVZ was substantially higher
    during January, February and the beginning of March.

    [Intrade](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Intrade) prediction markets
    contracts. In the case of the euro, Intrade has three separate contracts based
    on the possibility that a euro zone member announces it will stop using the euro
    as its national currency. The three contracts have expiration dates of the end
    of 2012, 2013 and 2014 and currently indicate (see top graphic below) that the
    probability of any euro zone country announcing it will drop the euro is 37.5%
    by the end of 2012, 61% for the end of 2013 and 68% for the end of 2014.

    market contracts, the trend also bears watching. The bottom graphic shows trades
    in the 2012 contract. Much to my surprise, sentiment that Greece (or any other
    country) will exit the euro this year apparently peaked (for now, at least) yesterday
    afternoon, and pulled back somewhat today, in choppy trading. For those who wish
    to [watch this contract on a tick by tick basis](https://data.intrade.com/graphing/jsp/timeAndSalesForm.jsp?contractId=713737&tradeURL=https://www.intrade.com),
    try the Advanced Charts option and click the Time and Sales radio button. Note
    that it is also possible to set alerts for this contract.

    while helpful, are far from perfect. Still, if your talents do not include four
    dimensional euro zone dominoes in Greek, these prediction contracts can be a great
    shorthand for determining how certain events are likely to play out.
