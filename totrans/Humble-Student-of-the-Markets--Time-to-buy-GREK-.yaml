    ways investors can get exposure to Greek stocks is through the Global X FTSE Greece
    20 ETF (GREK), in addition to a number of listed ADRs.

- en: As of the close on Monday, GREK was down 20% from Friday's close. Does this
    mean that speculators should step up and buy GREK in anticipation of a likely
    "Yes" vote in the upcoming referendum?

    hand, the ETF did rally through a downtrend and the price has start to stabilize
    and go sideways, which is constructive. On the other hand, it did break support
    today on high volume, which is a bad sign.

    of percentage holdings is based on Friday night's close, before the surprise referendum
    call and serves as a useful benchmark for valuation as that was the last time
    we had actual Athens Stock Exchange prices to compare against. The following table
    from Yahoo Finance, shows the top three holdings to be the local Coca-Cola bottler
    at roughly 20% weight, the local telecom at 10%, followed by the lottery operation
    at about 10%. While the first three holdings appear to have some stability and
    somewhat defensive in nature, the next few are banks, all of which have significant
    risk attached.

    another overview of ETF holdings. Based on some quick back of the calculations,
    I get an estimated range of $6.57 to $7.56 per share.

    in the referendum and Grexit looms. I assume that the financials all get wiped
    out (24% weight), the Consumer Cyclical sector gets cut in half (18% weight) and
    everything else takes a 20% haircut. Based on Friday`s closing price of $11.78,
    that would give us a downside target of $6.57 per share.

    represented roughly 24% of the value of GREK. Therefore the current valuation
    of the ETF, which is blind because there are no market prices of the underlying
    share in Athens, is based on the dubious assumption that the banking sector won`t
    get wiped out.

    but it may not be. The IMF has 30 days to call Greece in arrears so technically
    Greek government guaranteed collateral, and hence the Greek banks, are still solvent
    after the 30th. However on the 20th of July the Greeks will surely default to
    the ECB without a deal. This is the official d day.

    to the Euro system. The Greek banks then become insolvent and the ECB, through
    the newly created Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM), is obligated to resolve the
    Greek banks.

    capital controls and we will begin resolution of your banks unless u sign the
    agreement and re-enter a program. Without a bailout program in place the Greek
    government, and banking system, are both insolvent. So Tsipras says – what do
    you mean resolve my banking system? And then Mario explains as follows. First
    we wipe out all equity and bond holders. And then, as in Cyprus, we bail in depositors.
    There are 130b in Greek deposits against 90b in ELA. And while those deposits
    are technically insured up to 100,000 euro, there is no pan European bank insurance
    yet in place. That only comes in 2016\. Right now Greek deposits are only insured
    with a Greek deposit insurance fund that has about 3b in it. This Is hardly enough
    for the 130b in deposits. So we take the 130b against the 90b in ela. Any remaining
    deposits go to fund a bad bank that begins resolving all the NPLs. The good loans
    of course will go into a good bank which will be funded with German capital and
    most likely will have a German name. Of course depositors will get 2 to 3 euro
    cents on the dollar for their existing balances from the 3bio in the insurance
    fund. So you have that going for you!

    so that it could wait for the results of the referendum, what upset the Eurogroup
    ministers was not just the surprise referendum call, but that the Tsipras government
    would be actively campaigning for the No side. Notwithstanding the fact that the
    Eurogroup offer expired on June 30, the active campaign for No by the Greek government
    made the Syriza government an unreliable partner in the Eurogroup`s eyes. How
    can such an organization be expected to implement any reforms that may have been
    agreed to. A Yes vote will likely cause the current Greek government to collapse
    and new elections called. Prime Minister Tsipras has indicated that he would resign
    should the Yes side prevail in a TV interview on Monday night (via

    to keep supporting Greece and its banking system in the run-up to the referendum,
    there are some real drop-dead deadlines. There is a payment to the ECB on July
    24 and, if Christine Lagarde is willing, there is a 30-day grace period for the
    missed payment to the IMF on June 30.

    Syriza government were to collapse. It is unclear whether there would be enough
    time to call new elections, form a new government and see the new government agree
    to a new bailout program before the July 24 ECB payment deadline. While the ECB
    could conceivably bend the rules and keep the banking system going at the current
    ELA levels until July 24, there would be no justification to do so if a payment
    to the ECB is missed. The ECB has no choice other than to resolve the banking
    system,

    Ordinary citizens who do not have the means or sophistication to move their money
    abroad and businesses with operating accounts with daily cash flows. Both would
    collapse and so would the Greek economy. Business collapses have cascading effects
    that cannot be reversed immediately.

    still get wiped out. So assume that GREK takes a 24% haircut on its position in
    financials and a 20% haircut on everything else, we get a target price of $7.56
    based on the Friday close of $11.78.

    am not willing to make such a courageous assumption.
