    mandatory featherbedding. They also may back off on the demand that $10B go directly
    to the union's unfunded health care pension. UAW president promises that labor
    costs will be competitive...in 2010...for new workers. Thus, existing workers
    keep their comfy benefits, which are much higher than what they would get if Detroit
    did not have to deal with the union. Given their labor costs are about

    hour work weeks and weekends." anymore. I don't even work in a factory (right
    now). I work in a test facility. All of the mechanics are union. If a bolt breaks
    or some wiring (CAN lines, 0 voltage) I need to put in a work order to get it
    done. A 30 second fix will take 6 hours. If you even look at their tool chest
    wanting to borrow something you'll get written up. Then you have a grievance on
    your permanent record AND the union guy gets paid double for that time because
    you went around him.

    For example if you're a process improvement engineer and you need to figure out
    how to improve a process. You need to stand and watch some guy with only a high
    school diploma do it. You can't touch anything. See a piece of trash on the ground.
    Leave it (even if it's a safety hazard) if the floor sweeper sees you, you'll
    have another grievance because you're "Taking his job away".

    of ours. Turns out that it is over torqued at the factory. So management and the
    powers that be put out an official decree: No air wrenches on X bolt. The union
    continues to use them. Legally we can''t ''take them away'' or go into their tool
    boxes after they leave. So our bolt continues to fail because Joe Blow is too
    damn lazy to use a proper torque wrench.'

    same company at a different, non-union plant). It's absolutely farking wonderful.
    I can walk out on the production line. Grab a tool, use it to see how something
    is done and then go finish my report/project. One day I had to build a proto type.
    I was all scared because I had just left a union shop. I was out there all timid
    until one of the guys spoke up "Oh, we're not union." Then he rolls over a tool
    chest. Gives me a 10 second demo on how to use the overhead crane. And leaves
    me. At the end of the day he helps me sweep up my stuff. We BS about the project
    and it was an absolute joy.

    not my job." (My friends at Toyota point this out readily). If you have one production
    line down and one that is short of people. You go work on the one that needs people.
    In a union shop you get "that's not my job." So the workers from line X sit and
    play cards while the workers from line Y barely meet demand.

    take someone off of a slow production line (Say an SUV line) and put them on a
    small car line in a day of training. Most factories are idiot proofed to the point
    of you don't even need to know english to put bolt X into nut Y and tighten with
    the wrench.
