- en: I showed yesterday how a very-low volume day during a decline can often lead
    to a short-term reversal. Today I will review a study that first appeared in the
    blog on 5/13/2008\. It looks at extremely low volume on strong up days - like
    Monday. (Volume studies typically use the symbol $TVOL in Tradestation, which
    is their measure of NYSE volume. This is what is being used in the below study.)

    edge in these very low volume rises is for real. One caveat with Monday’s action
    though is that it was Yom Kippur, meaning a lot of traders were out of action
    and somewhat lower volume could be expected. Still, it’s been a steady enough
    edge that I decided to it was worth review.
