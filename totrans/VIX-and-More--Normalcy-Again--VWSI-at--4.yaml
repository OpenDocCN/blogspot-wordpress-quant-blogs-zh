    calls for a return to “[normalcy](http://www.quotedb.com/speeches/return-to-normalcy)”
    back in 1920, Americans – investors or otherwise – ended up with a decade that
    was anything but normal.

    taking aim at the Yucatan instead of the [Texas refineries](http://www.pannexresearch.com/rita/tx-oil.gif),
    we have almost surely seen a top in volatility.  That being said, the VIX managed
    to close up on a weekly basis for the fifth time in the past six weeks, finishing
    the week at 29.99, up 6% (1.69) from the previous week.  Is normalcy really just
    around the corner? My guess is that it is not too far away. The new high water
    mark in the VIX is now 37.50, which is the highest reading since October 2002,
    when the markets were just [beginning to bottom, before turning up](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/08/how-does-recent-vix-spike-compare.html)
    for the current five year bull run.

- en: The VWSI continues in uncharted waters at -4 this week, but with the VIX already
    25% off of the 37.50 spike top, there is finally evidence that the laws of gravity
    have been reinstated, at least temporarily.  As the graphic below shows, the VWSI
    is now mildly bearish on the VIX, with mildly bullish implications for the overall
    markets.  If you consider the strong possibility that the markets can no longer
    dwell on options expiration, a Fed with it’s head in the sand, or Hurricane Dean
    threatening the Texas-Louisiana oil infrastructure, then I suspect the coming
    week will more likely bring bullish surprises than bearish ones, especially given
    that it is a relatively slow week on the government data front.

    that it is safe to go back in the water, but I tend to think that excessive caution
    will likely result in missing out on the first big leg of a post-panic bounce.

- en: '*****Wine pairing:***  A VWSI of -4 comes along only a couple of times each
    year, so it is a good excuse to get off of the beaten varietal track.  Also, it
    never hurts to diversify one’s portfolio internationally.  With those thoughts
    in mind, I am recommending some [tempranillo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempranillo)
    for a VWSI of -4.  Tempranillo is the classic Spanish red grape that has long
    dominated the wine scene in [Rioja](http://www.civusa.com/consumerCenter/regions/riojaRegion.html)
    and [Ribera del Duero](http://www.civusa.com/consumerCenter/regions/riberaRegion.html).'

    not widely planted in the <country-region st="on">US</country-region> and focus
    instead on <country-region st="on"><place st="on">Spain</place></country-region>,
    which remains the center of world class tempranillo.  For a good introduction
    to the grape and some affordable entry level recommendations, try [Spain’s Early
    Ripener](http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/05/11/WIG8EPN97T1.DTL)
    by Blake Gray in the San Francisco Chronicle.  Considering that Spanish tempranillo
    is comparable in quality and stature to an Italian Super Tuscan, a French Bordeaux,
    or a American cabernet sauvignon, you should also be amenable to higher price
    points.  Some excellent places to get ideas about premium tempranillos include
    the [2007 Shanghai Tempranillos al Mundo awards](http://www.enologo.com/tempranillo/awards2007.pdf),
    the [San Francisco Chronicle wine competition awards](http://www.winejudging.com/medal_winners_2007/490.htm),
