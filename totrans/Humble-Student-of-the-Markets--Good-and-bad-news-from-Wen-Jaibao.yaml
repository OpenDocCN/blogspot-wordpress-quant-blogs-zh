    magical. The locals are so delightfully kind to us and have enthusiastically welcomed
    our entourage into their homes. But, Papa, their smallholdings are so sad, mainly
    untended and barely fit to support the livestock they keep. Their pigs are far
    from healthy, being underfed and almost at death's door. I feel so sorry for them,
    Papa. Please would you allow me to buy them some feed?

    outside Vienna. Their cheery demeanor was so charming I felt I just had to leave
    them one of your One Billion credit line notes. The joy in their eyes made it
    well worthwhile and, Papa, I so wished you could have been there to hear them
    singing your praises from the tops of their churches to St Reuters and St Bloomberg.
    Their delight was such that they have even promised 20% of their wheat harvest
    for the next 20 seasons, for your delectation! Oh Papa, would you believe it?

    China has already bought more than €40bn of euro-denominated assets this year,
    many in peripheral economies, and yet the crisis rolls on.
