    performance recently, they are nowhere near the drawdowns seen in August 2007.

    really fast. The system seized up and suffered a “heart attack” as a result. As
    the liquidity pressure eased, performance gradually came back to “normal”.

    effect. The Phoenix effect is not as sudden as the heart attack liquidity effect
    seen in August 2007\. However, it can be longer lasting and can be like a cancer
    as it eats away at performance. I recall that Jeff deGraaf reported in late 2003
    that the return spread between the lowest and highest decile of stock price was
    about 70% - an astounding return to a factor for less than one year.

    need to prepare for these negative environments in different ways. In the case
    of August 2007, they need to seek out new sources of alpha that are uncorrelated
    with their current alphas, which is easier said than done. In the case of the
    Phoenix effect, the recent bout of negative performance could be just a taste
    of what investors could see in the next 6-12 months. This is another example of
    how quant managers need to think hard about the assumptions behind their models
    and adjust their positions accordingly in order to
