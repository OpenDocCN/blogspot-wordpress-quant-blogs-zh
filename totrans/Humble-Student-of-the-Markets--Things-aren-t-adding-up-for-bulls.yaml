    we observe reflects a unique signature of recessions comprising deterioration
    in financial and economic measures that is always and only observed during or
    immediately prior to U.S. recessions.*** These include a widening of credit spreads
    on corporate debt versus 6 months prior, the S&P 500 below its level of 6 months
    prior, the Treasury yield curve flatter than 2.5% (10-year minus 3-month), year-over-year
    GDP growth below 2%, ISM Purchasing Managers Index below 54, year-over-year growth
    in total nonfarm payrolls below 1%, as well as important corroborating indicators
    such as plunging consumer confidence. There are certainly a great number of opinions
    about the prospect of recession, but the evidence we observe at present has 100%
    sensitivity (these conditions have always been observed during or just prior to
    each U.S. recession) and 100% specificity (the only time we observe the full set
    of these conditions is during or just prior to U.S. recessions). ***This doesn''t
    mean that the U.S. economy cannot possibly avoid a recession, but to expect that
    outcome relies on the hope that "this time is different."***'
