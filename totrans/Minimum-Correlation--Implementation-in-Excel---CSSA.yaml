- en: We are planning to release some excel worksheets next week showing the implementation
    of the minimum correlation algorithms and also maximum diversification, minimum
    variance and risk parity. Michael Kapler from Systematic Investor has worked with
    me to write the paper, and has written an interesting post on [how to implement
    the algorithm in excel by calling from R](http://systematicinvestor.wordpress.com/2012/09/27/calling-minimum-correlation-algorithm-from-excel-using-rexcel-vba/).

    versus quadratic programming (mincorr is much faster). We both plan to show some
    follow up posts on different applications and variations of the algorithm. If
    you haven’t already added Systematic Investor to your list of blogs to read it
    is highly recommended for more advanced readers.
