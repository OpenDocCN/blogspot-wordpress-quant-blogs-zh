    This is often referred to as an “inside day” because the range was completely
    inside the previous day’s range. In the past I have shown how inside days under
    the 200ma have often been followed by moves lower. What’s interesting is that
    while that held true for a long time, since the bottom in 2009 it has not been
    the case. Let’s first look at an updated results table based on this setup.

    not provided a downside edge.  Both the 1-day and 2-day profit curves looked very
    similar to this.

- en: It is important to understand when historical instances provide a directional
    edge.  But the market is always evolving.  And sometimes setups that provided
    an edge for a long time will either stop working or will go a period of time without
    demonstrating the same tendency.  It is important to monitor not only how has
    a setup performed over the long term, but also keep an eye on recent instances
    to ensure that edge is still being provided.  In this case it doesn’t seem to
    be.
