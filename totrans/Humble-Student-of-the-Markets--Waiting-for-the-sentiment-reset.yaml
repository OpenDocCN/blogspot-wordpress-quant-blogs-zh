    the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    in this market and in desperate need of a reset. The latest BoA Global Fund Manager
    survey shows that institutional risk appetite is at historically high levels.

    (CPCE), which tends to measure retail sentiment, is extremely low indicating excessive
    bullishness. By contrast, the index put/call ratio (CPCI), which measures institutional
    hedging activity, has been rising indicating cautiousness. Such high spreads between
    CPCE and CPCI have resolved themselves with market pullbacks in the past.
