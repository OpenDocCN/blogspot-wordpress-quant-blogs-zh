    deck, given you get to 'randomly' pick the card (eg, ace of clubs). With a fair
    deck the odds are 1/52, but given the card picker is a magician this is probably
    not a 'fair' deck. So an obvious potential answer is 100%, especially if you are
    being asked in front of a large audience.

    should focus upon, the outside-the-box things that seem to bedevil real life.
    Look for the magicians, not the simple odds in a fair deck.

    AIG. These were not properly calculated risks that went awry, nor were they outright
    fraud where an unauthorized intraday position blew up. They were the result of
    investors or management not fully understanding the risks that were being taken
    (the CEO off AIG was telling employees they had no, zero, exposure to mortgages
    throughout most of 2008). These risks—breakdowns in incentives, communication,
    assumptions, etc.—are called operating risks, and represent a residual of all
    things that are not cleanly within credit or market risks. If operating risk are
    the primary reason why financial firms fail, emphasis on refining models where
    the assumptions are presumed true seemingly misses the point.

- en: Operating risk is neglected by risk management for good reason. It is impossible
    to quantify existing operating risks, which in turn makes it near impossible to
    evaluate methods of monitoring and reducing these risks. One can endlessly discuss
    assumptions, but invariably there comes a time to make an assumption and then
    work on those assumptions. To merely assume anything can happen in a particular
    instrument invariably will imply you should not be investing in that instrument,
    because if it makes money under the 'anything can happen' assumption it is obvious
    arbitrage.

    box', shouldn't one focus outside the box? That is, if what brings down most companies
    are flawed assumptions or poor controls rather than poor luck, then most of the
    true risk for a trading operation is not in stress tests or Value-at-Risk, but
    the risks that exist outside a firm’s precisely calculated risk metrics.

    wins and losses is turnovers: you get a turnover you gain a huge amount of field,
    and vice versa if you lose. While you should tell your players to hold onto the
    ball, and not throw interceptions, this can''t be the focus of your game preparation.
    There is a lot of luck involved in turnovers, and generally, a team fighting to
    catch up, or afraid of getting the snot smacked out of them, fumbles more. Focus
    on what you can improve.'

    such as overconfidence, laziness, fraud, and gross incompetence. Yet complicating
    this picture is the fact that traders are notorious for continually expanding
    the scope of products they offer, especially because these cutting-edge products
    tend to have higher profit margins. This is a risk a profitable trading floor
    cannot avoid; by the time a product is fully understood by independent risk managers,
    the large margins will be gone. As opposed to academia where one can spend a long
    time on a single issue that one defines, in the private sector quants have to
    come up with solutions for many problems they do not fully understand, and do
    not have the luxury of saying 'it may lose 100% of its value' as if that's helpful.

    is incomplete. Knowing how to prioritize one's focus is a big part of that. There's
    nothing more pointless than a bunch of high IQ quants—whose comparative advantage
    is not the 'bigger picture'—focused on that bigger picture. Have them calculate
    the implications to standard assumptions. This is yeoman's work, essential but
    insufficient
