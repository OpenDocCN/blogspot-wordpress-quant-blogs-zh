- en: The communique changes the role of “Market Economy” from “基础性 (Jichuxing)” (used
    in the past 20 years) to “决定性 (juedingxing)”. For native Chinese speakers like
    us with years of intensive training in Chinese (and we did well on the grueling
    GRE too), we found it very difficult to tell the real difference. Bloomberg translated
    “ 基础性 (Jichuxing)” to “basic”, but we think it could be translated to “fundamental
    (foundational)” or “essential” as well. Regarding “决定性 (juedingxing)”, it could
    be translated to “deciding”, “determining” or “decisive”. We suspect the Chinese
    people won’t interpret too much from this change.

    role of public ownership, which was a signal that any reform of state owned enterprises
     (SOE) was unlikely. The reason why that is significant is that since the time
    of the Deng Xiaopeng reforms, China has grown in leaps and bounds, but most of
    the wealth have accrued to the Party cadres and insiders. The combination of regulated
    prices and a crony capitalist culture has made many Party officials obscenely
    wealthy, with most of the fund stashed offshore. It has only been recently that

    to the consumer, the authorities would have to stop, or at least lessen, the financial
    repression of the household sector with higher wages and interest rates for household
    savings. All those steps would hurt the interest of the Party insiders who got
    filthy rich.

- en: A successful transition to the next phase of wealth creation – driven by the
    services sector and knowledge-based industries – will require a more market-oriented
    approach, in which the state cedes some control over the economy and focuses instead
    on protecting property rights, administering welfare services, reducing pollution,
    and eliminating corruption. Improved governance, together with greater support
    for market-based innovation, is needed to sustain a thriving economy.

- en: Instead, what did we get? No SOE reform. Instead of ceding some control over
    the economy, we got the affirmation that dominance of public ownership. Moreover,
    the Party tightened control, instead of ceding control, over the economy via the
    establishment of a state security committee and a leading group on deepening reform.
    Depending on how the "leading group" is composed, it could be a mechanism for
    which market liberalization efforts are obstructed and buried by the bureaucracy.

  zh: 然而，我们得到的结果是什么呢？没有国有企业（SOE）改革。我们没有看到经济控制权的部分让渡，反而确认了公有制的主体地位。此外，党通过建立国家安全委员会和深化改革领导小组，加强了对经济的控制，而不是让渡控制权。如何组成这个“领导小组”将决定市场自由化努力是否会被官僚体制阻碍和埋没。
