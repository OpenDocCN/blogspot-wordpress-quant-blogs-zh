- en: The message from Jerome Powell's post-FOMC press conference was confusing. The
    overall economic outlook was positive, but the Fed was nevertheless cutting the
    Fed Funds target rate by a quarter-point. It was advertised as an "insurance"
    cut. Powell went on to spook the markets by stating that it was not the start
    of an easing cycle, but walked that partially back by holding out the possibility
    of more cuts.

- en: One of the key factors the Fed must respond to is the specific economic mess
    Trump creates when he upsets the global trade regime, and the size of that mess
    requires a qualitative assessment. Powell can’t say “We’ll cut rates in September
    if Trump threatens Xi Jinping seven times on Twitter, but not if he only does
    it five times”; he’s going to have to make a judgment call about where we stand
    with trade (and about how businesses and investors are responding based on their
    own assessments about where we stand with trade) when the time comes.
