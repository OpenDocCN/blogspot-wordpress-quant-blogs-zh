    industry, has had it. While he is pleased with the run-up in financials in recent
    days, he still sees signs of Armageddon in the sector.

    assets. His FBR Large Cap Financial fund stood at 50% cash at the end of June,
    up from 2% at the start of 2007, and his FBR Small Cap Financial is at 38% from
    0%, according to Morningstar Inc. "I don't want to lose any more money," said
    Mr. Ellison, an intense fellow who speaks about the stocks with barely concealed
    anger.

    to pick the darn best small-cap financial companies, not to time the market. There
    are plenty of nervous Nellys on CNBC giving you contradictory advice on timing
    the market, and they are right about 50% of the time. If the equity market has
    a premium, listening to these guys merely means you get half the premium you otherwise
    would have.
