    the rest of the chart, unless the risk free rate used is very high or maybe the
    leverage relative to capital employed is low. Just a guess, but the leverage is
    low reflecting the annual rate of return. It looks like a very impressive performance.

    As the average trade of $95 could be sensitive to those assumptions.
