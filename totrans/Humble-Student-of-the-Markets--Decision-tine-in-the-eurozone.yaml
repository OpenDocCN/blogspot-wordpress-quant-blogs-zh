    chief economist at ING-DiBa in Frankfurt, wrote in a note to clients yesterday.
    “It would be welcome grist to the mills of Germans’ opposition against QE. In
    our view, given the political and economic sensitivity of the Court’s verdict,
    an outright condemnation of the legality of OMT is highly unlikely.”

    contributes 14.2 percent. Cyrpus, meanwhile, pays the least with 0.15 percent

    at the January 25 election. Prime Minister Samaras’ New Democracy has not been
    able to close the 2-3 percentage point lead. Even with the 50 bonus seats given
    to the party that gets the most votes, it appears Syriza may not secure a majority
    in parliament. If it fails to do so after three days, the party with the second
    highest vote count will get a chance. New Democracy may be able to do so, avoiding
    another election.

  zh: 在希腊，最新的民调显示，Syriza在1月25日的选举中继续赢得多数选票。总理萨马拉斯的新民主党未能缩小2-3个百分点的领先优势。即使有50个额外席位授予获得最多选票的政党，看起来Syriza可能仍无法在议会中确保多数席位。如果三天后仍无法做到这一点，得票数第二多的政党将获得机会。新民主党或许能够做到，从而避免再次选举。
