    viewpoint, the Euro STOXX 50 is forming a wedge and I am watching for the direction
    of the breakout.

    chief economist at ING-DiBa in Frankfurt, wrote in a note to clients yesterday.
    “It would be welcome grist to the mills of Germans’ opposition against QE. In
    our view, given the political and economic sensitivity of the Court’s verdict,
    an outright condemnation of the legality of OMT is highly unlikely.”

    example Germany pays in 17.9 percent of the total contributions, while France
    contributes 14.2 percent. Cyrpus, meanwhile, pays the least with 0.15 percent

    at the January 25 election. Prime Minister Samaras’ New Democracy has not been
    able to close the 2-3 percentage point lead. Even with the 50 bonus seats given
    to the party that gets the most votes, it appears Syriza may not secure a majority
    in parliament. If it fails to do so after three days, the party with the second
    highest vote count will get a chance. New Democracy may be able to do so, avoiding
    another election.

    Euro STOXX 50\. Given the kinds of deflationary winds emanating from Europe, it
    may be eurozone developments that drive the next direction in the stock market,
    rather than Earnings Season in the US.
