    estimates have been falling dramatically in the last few weeks - so much to the
    extent that a view is developing that expectations have been lowered so far that
    they are relatively easy to beat. The latest update from

    the expectations have been racheted down sufficiently that they are easy to beat.
    For some context, Factset compiled the issues raised by companies in their earnings
    calls and pointed out that 70% of the negative factors cited so far have been
    currency related.

- en: To put the USD effect into context, the chart below compares the US Dollar Index
    (top panel) with the price of oil (bottom panel). First of all, just look at the
    magnitude of those moves! Now look at the developing divergence. Even as the price
    of oil appears to be stabilizaing and carving out a bottom, the USD Index continues
    to rise. So while the negative effects of lower oil prices are mostly reflected
    in energy stocks, the strong USD effect on the rest of the market may not be over.

    has been lowered sufficiently that companies can beat Street estimates. However,
    we should never forget that the market is forward looking. Should the USD continue
    to rally, the chorus of company currency "excuses" might be enough to spook the
    markets into a sell-off on the basis that 2Q earnings will be weak because of
    further negative FX effects..
