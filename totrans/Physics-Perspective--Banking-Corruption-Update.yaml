    $85 million (much less than 1% of its revenues for the last quarter alone). No
    one will be prosecuted, this despite apparent evidence that multiple bank employees
    "falsified income information on mortgage applications."

    as the Fed puts it, “by Wells Fargo Financial’s incentive compensation and sales
    quota programs.” Matthew R. Lee, the executive director of Inner City Press/Community
    on the Move and Fair Finance Watch, spent years bringing Wells’ subprime abuses
    to the attention of the Federal Reserve. “The way the compensation was designed
    ensured that abuses would take place,” he says. “It was a predatory system."

    us the financial crisis. Brokers working for subprime mortgage companies routinely
    doctored incomes to hand out subprime loans they knew the borrowers could never
    repay — and then, after taking their fat fees, shoveled the loans to Wall Street,
    which bundled them into subprime securities. This was the kindling that lit the
    inferno of September 2008\. So again, I ask: Why is there no criminal investigation
    into what went on at Wells Fargo Financial?'

    to economists' arguments about financial incentives and the inefficiencies of
    good old fashioned legal punishments (i.e. jail time), but I can't see the culture
    on Wall St. changing one tiny bit until the law shows some real teeth. The dearth
    of prosecutions suggests that few people in power really want it to change.
