    invited guest blogger Jennifer Groton to share with us a quick survey of various
    common HFT strategies used by equities and FX traders.

    in our national exchanges was duly noted as a short-circuit waiting to happen
    and drew immediate industry criticism of auto-trading robots. Before a witch-hunt
    ensues, perhaps a review of the common HFT strategies in stocks and Forex is in
    order.

- en: High-frequency firms employ a wide variety of  low-margin trading strategies
    that are implemented by professional market intermediaries who have invested heavily
    in technology. These firms claim that they make markets more efficient by enhancing
    liquidity and transparent price discovery to the benefit of investors.  The Forex
    market’s unique combination of high liquidity and low volatility make it an ideal
    environment for deploying

    Many firms in this area have been described as engaging in "rebate-capture trading",
    a reference to the credits that firms get for providing liquidity on most market
    centers.

    The classic arbitrage strategy is a form of the “carry trade” that uses the prices
    of a domestic bond, a bond denominated in a foreign currency, the spot price of
    the currency, and the price of a forward contract on the currency.  If the market
    prices are sufficiently different from those implied in the model to cover transactions
    costs, then four transactions can be made to guarantee a risk-free profit.

    of trades on our equity markets.  Similar statistics are not available for forex
    markets, but speculating disguised as commercially necessary trades have been
    reported to be over two-thirds of the volume.  Liquidity and pricing transparency
    are the benefits offered by its advocates, but regulators and other market participants
    who disagree with this positive assessment are presently discounting these benefits. 
    Transaction taxes and time limits on orders have been proposed to mitigate the
    perceived risk created by HFT firms, but the wheels of Washington move slowly,
    even in crisis.  For the time being, there is no indication that their participation
    will be discontinued.
