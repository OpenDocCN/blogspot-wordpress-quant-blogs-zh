- en: about how seals are endangered by rogue icebergs. A seal needs oxygen, and so,
    if the ice plate is too large, they eventually suffocate. In the BBC series 'The
    Blue Earth', there's a poignant story about beluga whales living in the Artic
    that assiduously scrape holes for breathing with their teeth in between feeding
    on fish. Eventually, their teeth are scraped to nubs, they are no longer able
    to maintain their air hole, and so they die. Thus, every scrape that maintains
    the lifeline, runs down the enamel on their teeth, one step closer to death.

    about the fate of elderly moose (mooses? meese?). It seems, as they get older,
    they basically have two scenarios for them. In one, as they get old and they loose
    their ability to rub against trees and do other things to protect themselves,
    so ticks eventually overwhelm them and they bleed to death. In the other scenario,
    they become so weak wolves overwhelm them, and they are literally disemboweled.
