    is hard to come by at this point, but Jamie Tyrrell’s ([optionMONSTER](http://www.optionmonster.com/))
    [Volatility Sonar](http://www.optionmonster.com/webcasts/volatility_sonar/) report
    from Friday indicates that a Barclays representative is talking about a launch

    an August 27, 2008 [prospectus](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/312070/000119312508258868/d424b3.htm#toc)
    that describes the ETNs at some length and lists a [VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX)
    ticker for the iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN and a [VXY](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXY)
    ticker for the iPath S&P 500 VIX Mid-Term Futures ETN.
