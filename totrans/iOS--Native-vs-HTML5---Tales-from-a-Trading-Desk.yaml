- en: The HTML5 umbrella bandwagon has always caused a debate between whether to build
    an iPad/iPhone app in native iOS or HTML5.¬† Historically, native iOS has usually
    offered better performance, even though there is the Objective-C hurdle to overcome.¬†
    Facebook‚Äôs [recent](http://www.macnewsworld.com/story/76007.html) move away from
    HTML5 to native iOS reflects this view.¬† Thus, its interesting to see that the
    iPhone 5 A6 processor is doing rather well on the JavaScript benchmarking tool
    if the [AppleInsider](http://appleinsider.com/articles/12/09/19/apple_a6_soc_outperforms_intel_atom_in_javascript_test)
    article is to be believed.¬† Curious to see if this aids the HTML5 bandwagon üôÇ
