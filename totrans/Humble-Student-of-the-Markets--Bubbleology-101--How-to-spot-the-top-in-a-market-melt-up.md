# Humble Student of the Markets: Bubbleology 101: How to spot the top in a market melt-up

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2018/01/bubbleology-101-how-to-spot-top-in.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2018/01/bubbleology-101-how-to-spot-top-in.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models**

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post,

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The

**Trend Model**

is an asset allocation model which applies trend following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or contraction (bearish)?"

My inner trader uses the

**trading component**

of the Trend Model to look for changes in the direction of the main Trend Model signal. A bullish Trend Model signal that gets less bullish is a trading "sell" signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading "buy" signal. The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. Past trading of the trading model has shown turnover rates of about 200% per month.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Buy equities*
*   Trend Model signal: Bullish*
*   Trading model: Bullish*

** The performance chart and model readings have been delayed by a week out of respect to our paying subscribers.* **Update schedule**

: I generally update model readings on my

on weekends and tweet mid-week observations at @humblestudent. Subscribers will also receive email notices of any changes in my trading portfolio.

**Come over to the Dark Side**

I have a confession to make. I've gone over to the Dark Side. Valuation doesn't matter. Excessively bullish sentiment doesn't matter. Overbought readings don't matter. The only thing matters is the Melt-Up (see

[Embrace the blow-off, but with a stop-loss discipline](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2017/11/26/embrace-the-blow-off-but-with-a-stop-loss-discipline/)

 and 

[Jeremy Grantham's call for a market melt-up](https://www.gmo.com/docs/default-source/research-and-commentary/strategies/asset-allocation/viewpoints---bracing-yourself-for-a-possible-near-term-melt-up.pdf)

).

If the market is indeed undergoing a blow-off rally, then investors should be mindful of Bob Farrell's Rule #4: "Parabolic markets go up further than you think, but they don't correct by going sideways."

Nevertheless, there are a number of simple techniques of spotting the top in a parabolic move.
