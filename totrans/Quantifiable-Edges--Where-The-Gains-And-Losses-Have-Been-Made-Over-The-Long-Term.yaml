    inspired me to take a look at market performance based on the market’s position
    relative to its moving averages. Below I broke down the position of the market
    into 4 quadrants: 1) Above both the 200ma and 50ma, 2) Above the 200ma and below
    the 50ma, 3) Below the 200ma and above the 50ma and 4) Below both the 200ma and
    50ma. I used simple moving averages in all cases. The performance of the S&P since
    1960 is shown by quadrant in the table below:'

- en: 1) The biggest long side edge appears to be when the market is trading above
    its 200 but below its 50-day moving average. At this point the market is in a
    long-term uptrend but is not extended to the upside over the short-term.

    results. The simple rule of looking for long trades above the 200ma and short
    trades below the 200ma appears to provide an edge.

    when it left this quadrant would have only been a profitable trade 29.8% of the
    time. The edge comes from the fact that some very big moves were caught.

    when it left this quadrant would have only been a profitable trade 22% of the
    time. Again the edge comes from some very big moves – including the current move.
