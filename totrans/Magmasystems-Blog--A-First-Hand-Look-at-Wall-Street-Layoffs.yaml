    ... so, don't take the fact that you have been separated from your company as
    an insult on your level of talent and expertise. Unfortunately, this is the nature
    of Wall Street. We over-hire in good times and over-fire in bad times. If you
    have great technical skills, then there are many opportunities for you outside

    these hiccups.
