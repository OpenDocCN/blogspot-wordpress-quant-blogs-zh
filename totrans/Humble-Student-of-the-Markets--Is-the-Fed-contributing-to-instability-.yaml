    bank. Paradoxically, mixed messages coming out of the Federal Reserve have contributed
    to the uncertainty.

    Committee and the Board of Governors anticipate that most of the Federal Reserve’s
    special liquidity facilities will expire on February 1, 2010, consistent with
    the Federal Reserve’s announcement of June 25, 2009\. These facilities include
    the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility,
    the Commercial Paper Funding Facility, the Primary Dealer Credit Facility, and
    the Term Securities Lending Facility. ***The Federal Reserve will also be working
    with its central bank counterparties to close its temporary liquidity swap arrangements
    by February 1***. ***The Federal Reserve expects that amounts provided under the
    Term Auction Facility will continue to be scaled back in early 2010.*** The anticipated
    expiration dates for the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility remain set
    at June 30, 2010, for loans backed by new-issue commercial mortgage-backed securities
    and March 31, 2010, for loans backed by all other types of collateral.

- en: Before the financial crisis there was a widespread sense, especially on Wall
    Street trading desks, that the stock market was strangely resilient. This encouraged
    excessive risk-taking in various types of assets. Do you have direct or indirect
    knowledge of the Federal Reserve or any government entity or proxy ever intervening
    to support the stock market (or any individual stock) via futures or in any other
    way? If yes, who decides the timing of such intervention and with what criteria?
    How is it funded? Which Wall Street firm handles the orders, and who sees them
    before they are executed?

    don’t make sense. In the case of PPT, governments are known to intervene in a
    variety of markets, such as FX and the bond market. Why would they want to keep
    intervention in the stock market a secret?

    been narrowing in the large caps. If the Fed or some other government agency was
    directly or indirectly buying S&P 500 futures, why is the Dow Jones Industrials
    outperforming the S&P 500?

    Chairman Bernanke can’t give a straight answer to a question about government
    intervention in the equity market. He is experienced enough to know that the markets
    parse every nuance of his statement so his incomplete answer can’t be an accident.

    by internal bickering or plain doesn’t know what to do. In these uncertain times,
    any of these conditions at a major central bank is downright scary.
