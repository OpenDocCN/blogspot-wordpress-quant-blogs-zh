    Magazine editors focus on an economic issue when it moves from page 20 to page
    1 in the public’s mind. By that time, it’s been largely discounted by the market.
    Politicians are worse. They follow the trends raised by magazine editors and are
    even more reactive.

- en: It was therefore of great interest that President Joe Biden kicked off his re-election
    by running on his economic record, which he called “Bidenomics”, which is composed
    of a grab bag of his past legislative initiatives such as infrastructure, renewable
    energy and semiconductors. The main theme is a focus on an economic revival for
    the middle class by emphasizing the addition of 1.3 million jobs and the achievement
    of a historically low unemployment rate.

- en: The Bidenomics focus raises a contrarian risk that the President is touting
    his economic record just when recession odds are elevated. Consensus expectations
    for a recession from a variety of surveys of economic forecasts call for a recession
    to begin in H2 2023.
