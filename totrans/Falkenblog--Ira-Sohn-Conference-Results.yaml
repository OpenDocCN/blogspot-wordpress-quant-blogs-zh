    over that period, adding yet another datapoint to the observation that advisers
    slightly lag the passive indices. On the bright side, Jim Chanos had two home-run
    picks--shorting VWS and FSLR--which will probably be sufficient to generate hope
    that while on average these recommendations are no good, if you pick the right
    ones, you can make a fortune.

    at best. Like education in general, trying to obtain wisdom given everything people
    have done and written is not straightforward. Surely reading such information
    is essential because no one could come up with all those insights by themselves,
    but unfiltered such data is no more informative than pop culture.  A lot of people
    with good intuition actually start ignoring such advice rather early because they
    see the diminishing marginal returns, why humans clearly become wiser from 0 to
    30 then pretty much level off on average.  I suspect it's like Sturgeon's law
    (ie, 90% of everything is crap), in that those who like to take a lot of advice
    or read a lot includes some who are very wise and who have learned much from the
    past and others; but most highly educated people don't understand that they aren't
    necessarily becoming wiser because they choose the bad gurus, or build upon bad
    assumptions.
