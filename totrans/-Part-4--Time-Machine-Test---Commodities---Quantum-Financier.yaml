- en: As you can see, the algorithm adapts to different classes of commodities and
    outperforms most of the buy and hold returns. But I want to emphasis that this
    concept alone is not something I would trade as is (not robust enough). The results
    are in no way good enough to rely on out-of-sample.

    enough to trade on for long periods on these assets. For equities, there is on
    average 7 different active strategies (i.e. the level of significance is high
    enough) at the same time. The number is much less with commodities and currencies,
    the lack of diversification between strategies certainly hurts performance when
    compared to equity indices. It also add on more exposure to a given strategy adding
    a lot of volatility to the returns as showed by the numbers above.
