    attracting so much attention that the [implied volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/implied%20volatility)
    of the VIX is currently at 133, which exceeds that high of 126 that was hit during
    the 2008 crisis. The obvious play here is to sell VIX calls, with short call spreads
    ([bear call spreads](http://www.optionsxpress.com/educate/strategies/bearcallspread.aspx))
    one way to limit risk.'
