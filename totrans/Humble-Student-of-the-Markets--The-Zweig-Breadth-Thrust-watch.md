# Humble Student of the Markets: The Zweig Breadth Thrust watch

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2021/08/the-zweig-breadth-thrust-watch.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2021/08/the-zweig-breadth-thrust-watch.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models** 

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post, 

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The 

**Trend Asset Allocation Model**

 is an asset allocation model that applies trend following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. The performance and full details of a model portfolio based on the out-of-sample signals of the Trend Model can be found

[here](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/trend-model-report-card/)

.

My inner trader uses a 

**trading model**

, which is a blend of price momentum (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa). Subscribers receive real-time alerts of model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of the email alerts is updated weekly 

[here](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/trading-track-record/)

. The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that began in March 2016 is shown below.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Buy equities*
*   Trend Model signal: Bullish*
*   Trading model: Bullish*

** The performance chart and model readings have been delayed by a week out of respect to our paying subscribers.***Update schedule**

: I generally update model readings on my 

[site](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/)

 on weekends and tweet mid-week observations at @humblestudent. Subscribers receive real-time alerts of trading model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of those email alerts is shown

**A possible ZBT buy signal**

The Zweig Breadth Thrust buy signal is a rare momentum buy signal that only occurs once every few years. 

Steven Achelis at [Metastock](http://www.metastock.com/Customer/Resources/TAAZ/?c=3&p=37) explains the indicator this way (emphasis added):

> A "Breadth Thrust" occurs when, during a 10-day period, the Breadth Thrust indicator rises from below 40% to above 61.5%. A "Thrust" indicates that the stock market has rapidly changed from an oversold condition to one of strength, but has not yet become overbought.
> 
> ***According to Dr. Zweig, there have only been [sixteen] Breadth Thrusts since 1945\. The average gain following these fourteen Thrusts was 24.6% in an average time-frame of eleven months. ***Dr. Zweig also points out that most bull markets begin with a Breadth Thrust.

The ZBT window began on Friday August 20, 2021\. It has 10 trading days, or until September 2, 2021 to flash a ZBT buy signal.

Besides a possible ZBT buy signal as an indicator of powerful price momentum, here is what else I am watching.
