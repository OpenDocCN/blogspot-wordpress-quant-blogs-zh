    the uptrend that began in October 2008\. Prices are also hovering near the 23.6%
    Fibonacci retracement level.

    South African Rand has been thought of by FX traders as a commodity play currency,

    the US ten-year at 3.83%, for a spread of 500 bps. Just for kicks, I looked at
    the cumulative P&L of this carry trade. As the chart below shows, this trade is
    also approaching a technical overhead resistance zone.

    these charts as they indicate a critical test for inflationary expectations.
