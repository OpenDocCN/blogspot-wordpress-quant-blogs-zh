    I have to spend each microsecond to other works rather than writing here about
    high-frequency trading and/or the world of microwave. That’s the reason I decided
    to offer the opportunity to different people involved (or not) in the HFT industry
    to write here. I thought the motto of this blog may become “*Where capital markets
    speak*” but another [organization](https://twitter.com/TabbFORUM) already took
    the headline – too bad. Anyway, I’m happy a couple of people agreed to replace
    me. Here is the first part of a new series, *Networks Effects*, written by my
    first guest I’m delighted to welcome here. I only slightly edited the text (a
    couple of photos, a few links, etc.) and added comments within [brackets], signed
    SIM. Happy reading.

    the sheer audacity of that name. A friend of mine, a fellow physicist, worked
    at a 1990s-era desk that pioneered [statistical arbitrage](http://www.hedgefund-index.com/d_statarb.asp)
    and early versions of high frequency trading. In that now-distant time, split-seconds,
    open phone lines, and human reaction times were all still relevant. I knew that
    servers were migrating to co-location in data centers to gain proximity to the
    exchanges. I’d heard the delicious rumors of the staggering PNLs that a collection
    of firms, mostly located in Chicago, were generating. “$1M per day”, “Effectively
    infinite [Sharpe](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sharperatio.asp).” [Once
    I read in a court document that a big “HFT” firm in Houston, in its early stages,
    around 2001, had a Sharpe ratio of a 20 to 40, “*which is extraordinarily high*”
    – SIM].  In late 2007, a person, perhaps in position to know, and after one too
    many margaritas, let slip what sounded like a key to a castle, “ETFs, Man, we’re
    unpacking the ETFs and arbing ‘em against the underlying.’ A few weeks later,
    a successful trader, completely sober, remarked cryptically, “Order of magnitude*,
    you need to think in dollars per millisecond*.” Another, “Read Lefevre’s [book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reminiscences_of_a_Stock_Operator).
    Everything in there still works.” It was a view through an imperfect, entirely
    incomplete window into a mysterious exhilarating world that was completely out
    of reach.

    HFT actually works? A few simple principles appeared to interpolate consistently
    through the rumors. (1) If latency is an issue, then the time scale over which
    one’s predictions are valid has to be short. That is, if you can somehow predict
    where a stock is going to be priced next week, then your concern is with order
    working and market impact, not with microsecond latencies or nanosecond time stamps. 
    (2) There’s simply no time to solve complicated equations during production. In
    the co-lo cage it has to be about heuristics and lookup tables. (3) The [Central
    Limit Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem) and the [Law
    of Large Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers) will work
    to one’s advantage. Diffusion scales with the [square root of time](http://www.macroption.com/why-is-volatility-proportional-to-square-root-of-time/),
    so VIX of 20 deannualizes to price-changing tick on the E-mini every few seconds.
    So [queue positioning](https://www.kcg.com/uploads/documents/KCG_NeedForSpeed1-Report.pdf)
    must be critical, and market making, or its high-tech equivalents *must* be a
    core component of HFT.

    about Spread Networks was published in September 2010, but I didn’t see it until
    the first week of November, and so it’s clear that others had long since formulated
    all the thoughts I immediately had upon reading it: For a fiber that was so straight
    and so expensive, why was the Chicago to New York round trip travel time so excruciatingly
    slow? The distance is about 1200 km, so the minimum one-way signal propagation
    time should be about four milliseconds, not seven. Then I remembered from second-semester
    physics that the index of refraction in glass is something like *n*=1.5… Confusion.'

    literally nothing about – suggested that there would be no show stoppers to either
    relaying a signal with a chain of microwave radios, or, at almost zero cost, using
    meteor burst communication. After convincing myself that I’d done enough due diligence
    to not make a fool of myself, I sent an e-mail floating those two schemes to a
    retired communications engineer whom I knew slightly. A week or so later, he wrote
    back.

    but I believe there may be some problems with doing it by meteor scatter. To my
    way of thinking, a standard microwave relay link chain may be the best bet, and
    there’s a possibility of using a two-hop tropospheric scatter link.

    from the distant end, or whether that can be eliminated through some cleverness
    so the latency is essentially “open loop.”'

    characteristic that the reflection from the ionized line doesn’t have the same
    geographic coverage as an ionized plane would, and so the number of useful meteor
    trails between two locations is greatly less than the total rate of meteors. Typical
    links are very narrow band, partly because they are generally low power. So a
    higher power link might resolve the burst rate issue, but even then, I believe
    there would not be sufficient aligned paths to provide real-time service.

    by outfits that lease tower and building space. In this situation, you could expect
    to have reasonable bandwidth, and the latency would of course be determined by
    the velocity of light in air, plus a little for the plumbing and circuitry. Modern
    equipment for this service is available, as are the antennas and feedlines. Because
    of the greater bandwidth and flexibility, and lower cost, of optical fiber, there
    hasn’t been a market for this particular technology. But I think the Chicago-New
    York one-way latency would be in the range of 4 ms for the 700 mile distance.

    link. This requires big antennas and high power, but that’s all been developed
    for satellite earth stations. There are 20 MB military systems, but the maximum
    range per hop is 400 miles, so you’d need an intermediate point. Given the reliance
    on the troposphere, there can be some outages, but the availability might be enough
    to be useful.

    optimal, the troposcatter scheme looked like it would be the fastest option. A
    survey of the troposcatter provider websites, however, showed infrastructure that
    invariably ran to armored Humvees, ominously large dishes, shipping container-sized
    generators, and camouflage netting. The prospects of orchestrating the parking
    of such rigs in downtown Chicago seemed remote.

    an idea that is even less far-fetched. You could just use unlicensed spectrum,
    such as that used for Wi-Fi, and set up a mesh network and the number of hops
    you need.

    base-station equipment with up to 30km range.  The main purpose is enterprise
    or municipal/rural Wi-Fi networks.  But with that kind of range you could conceivably
    set up around 40ish hops to get from NY to Chicago.  I’m not sure how much latency
    would be introduced on each hop, but I’m guessing no more than 20us.  At my previous
    job I worked on hardware processing of the entire network stack (TCP/IP) and the
    internal latency was well under 5us.  Using a conservative figure of 20us per
    hop adds an additional 800us (1.6ms round-trip) to the 8ms speed-of-light time.
     Still brings you in under 10ms total, which compared to the 13ms in the article
    is certainly a competitive advantage.   Also, the bandwidth should be respectable,
    something on the order of megabytes.  Nothing like fiber, but certainly enough
    to communicate trade information for some limited set of symbols.  The other advantage
    would be that it is somewhat scalable.  You could build multiple point-to-point
    hop links.  Since this stuff is line-of-sight, you could easily have parallel
    networks along very similar paths.  This would not only increase bandwidth, but
    add redundancy and reliability to the network.  The cost of this solution would
    be pretty minimal if the available products have reasonable performance.  I found
    another company, American Tower, that rents antenna tower space for cellular and
    radio (think of it as antenna hosting, similar to data-center hosting).  It seems
    like all the pieces are there to just go out and slap a solution together.  I’ve
    got to think the big players have done this, but again it’s one of those things
    that you could read about in the paper some day and think holy shit, we talked
    about that! After all, we talked about the tunnel to Chicago, and it turns out
    someone built it. And the minute it gets out that someone has done it, there would
    be a flood of people doing it, since it’s low-cost and straightforward.  The Wi-Fi
    spectrum along the straight-shot from NY to Chicago would get so crowded that
    nobody in rural Pennsylvania and Ohio would ever be able to use their Wi-Fi.  I’m
    sure at that point the government would have to step in.  So even if someone is
    using Microwave, I’m guessing the Wi-Fi idea is less likely.  There’s nothing
    liking hiding a top-secret super-low latency network in plain sight!
