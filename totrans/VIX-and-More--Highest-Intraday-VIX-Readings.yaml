- en: With stocks suffering a minor meltdown as I type this (DJIA 9997), I thought
    I might use the ongoing European sovereign debt crisis and recent May 21^(st)
    [VIX spike](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20spikes) to 48.20
    to put the recent VIX spike in the context of the all-time highest intraday VIX
    readings.

- en: The graphic below captures the six crises which have resulted in VIX spikes
    above the 40.00 level since 1990\. Notably, the 2008 financial crisis stands well
    above the crowed with an intraday high of 89.53\. The other five crises have all
    seen intraday VIX spikes that have topped out in the 48-50 range, with last month’s
    spike to 48.20 making the European sovereign debt crisis the 6^(th) highest threat
    – at least as far as an implied volatility proxy is concerned – in the past 20
    years.

    the best estimate is that the VIX (actually the [VXO](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXO))
    would have hit about 170.
