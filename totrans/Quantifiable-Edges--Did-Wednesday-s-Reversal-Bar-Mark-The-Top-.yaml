- en: Wednesday’s action saw a new intraday high, an outside day, and a lower close,
    and it came after a closing high was made the day before. Engulfing reversal bars
    such as this are often viewed as bearish. I’ve looked at them a number of ways
    in the past. Below are updated results of one such study.

- en: Results here are similar to other studies I’ve run on outside day or key reversal
    bars. It is often followed by a few days of weakness but it rarely marks the kind
    of significant top it is renowned for.

    instance). This did not have a material impact on the results.
