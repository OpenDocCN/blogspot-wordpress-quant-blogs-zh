    of today, a low of 165, since early 2014\.  It has also been associated with negative
    news across the year, concerning: bitcoin theft, shoddy exchanges, illicit uses,

     The ascent to the > 1000 price was largely built in the Nov – Dec ’13 period,
    and naturally the coin is reverting to sustainable levels.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unfortunately, the ascent to 1000+ was associated with a period where 2 algos were
    aggressively buying ~600,000 BTC from Mt Gox.   It is believed (though not confirmed)
    that these algos may have been used to perpetrate the fraud that stole the similar
    amount of bitcoin from Mt Gox (and its user base).   In other words, the algos may,
    through aggressive buying, have set up the momentum that took the price from sub
    $200 to over $1000\.  The whole movement may have been ignited and sustained by
    a fraud.  See this [analysis](https://willyreport.wordpress.com/2014/05/25/the-willy-report-proof-of-massive-fraudulent-trading-activity-at-mt-gox-and-how-it-has-affected-the-price-of-bitcoin/).

    inflated BTC valuation.   With adjustments to hash difficulty this may normalize,
    but for now should pressure miners to liquidate.

    negative impact of all of the above makes it very likely that BTC will sink further
    before it recovers (so far today it hit a low of $165).

    technology as opposed to the quick-and-dirty implementations (such as Mt Gox’s
    php travesty).  That said, developing carefully and with appropriate safeguards
    is not easy, especially in the context of a startup racing to get a product out
    the door.
