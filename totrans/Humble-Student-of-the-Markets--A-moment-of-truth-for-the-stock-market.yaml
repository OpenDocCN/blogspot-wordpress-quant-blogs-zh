    trade deal announced by Trump last Friday. I have been showing concerns for some
    time about the market`s valuation. Based on Friday`s close, the market was trading
    at a forward P/E ratio of 16.9, which is above its 5-year average of 16.6 and
    10-year average of 14.9.

    has to improve. Earnings Season starts in earnest this week as the big banks begin
    reporting tomorrow. That's the "moment of truth" for stock prices.
