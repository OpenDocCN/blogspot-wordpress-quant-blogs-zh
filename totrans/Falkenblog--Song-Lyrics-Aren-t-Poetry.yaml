    Morrison is not a poet in any sense of the word."'

    I think it only seems so when it accompanies good music, the mood swings of youth,
    depression, or drugs. That is, in combination with other emotional drivers, lyrics
    seem much deeper than they are. By themselves many tunes that sound emotionally
    powerful when sung, are almost parodies of themselves when read silently (MacArthur
    Park? Muskrat Love? Careless Whisper?). I watched a documentary of the making

    industries invariably become coddled, spoiled infants that never grow up. As per
    increasing returns, it is hardly a rigorous point: Microsoft and Google have both
    benefits (via increasing returns to scale) and costs (via decreasing returns to
    scale) peculiar to their large size. Yet if you dress the argument up in mathematics,
    where the idea is derived given algebraic assumptions for utility, production,

    parsimony or precision. In practice, economic models are abstruse arguments with
    mere potential for great scope, but the history of economics suggests great skepticism
    for this potential. What irreducible-to-words model, other than derivatives models
    in finance or statistical models in econometrics, have generalized to create a
    greater consensus on anything of economic importance? My best guess would be Ricardo's
    theory of comparative advantage, but note 1) that was made over 150 years ago
    and 2) it hasn't really convinced anyone that free trade is a good idea (it's
    easy to add some assumption that invalidates it).

    does the logic of mathematics help economics. But good economics, like good poetry,
    almost always stands by itself without the adjunct. Just as we should beware of
    poetry that only sounds good when there's music playing, we should distrust economic
    analysis that only seems profound within mathematical models. There's the hope
    that if we use some rigorous method of reasoning economics will avoid the stagnation
    of ideas we see in politics or journalism. Would that it were true.
