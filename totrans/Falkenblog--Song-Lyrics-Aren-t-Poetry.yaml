    I think it only seems so when it accompanies good music, the mood swings of youth,
    depression, or drugs. That is, in combination with other emotional drivers, lyrics
    seem much deeper than they are. By themselves many tunes that sound emotionally
    powerful when sung, are almost parodies of themselves when read silently (MacArthur
    Park? Muskrat Love? Careless Whisper?). I watched a documentary of the making
