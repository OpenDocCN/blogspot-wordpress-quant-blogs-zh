    constant is usually considered to be between 1 and 3, lets say 2 (as Salmon assumes).
    A higher risk coefficient means you are more risk averse, and note that if you
    increase it, your percent allocation of wealth to stocks goes to zero. The numerator
    is the expected return premium one gets for investing in the stock market. Most
    people assume this is 5% annually (I think it's

    In the short run, quantities don''t change, so if preferences or expectations

    That leaves the expected return. Presumably, the risk premium, the return you
    get for the displeasure of bearing undiversifiable risk, had to have risen 2.56
    times. But this turns out to be an empirical matter: do expected returns rise
    when volatility rises? Is it plausible that during this cataclysm, people were

    is to note that actual returns aren''t the same as expected returns, they vary
    by some statistical noise, and so perhaps we just don''t have enough data. Logically

    for which we can say we 'just don't know the true market portfolio', this result
    takes fewer assumptions, so its empirical failure is all the more fatal to the
    core financial theory. People should be increasing their expected returns in volatile
    markets, and on average that should manifest itself in actual returns. We don't
    see that in actual returns, or in surveys of expected returns.

    isn't true (a worse bad theory is wrong and consistent with the data, but merely
    because it doesn't predict anything). One of the many bad implications of having
    the delusion that risk begets a higher expected return is that people invest in
    the stock market thinking they then deserve a higher return, a strategy that worked
    pretty well in the US in the 20th century, as long as you implemented a low-cost
    strategy that minimized trading and taxes. In reality, you either have to hope
    for lady luck, or actually do a lot of work finding your investing alpha looking
    for subtle patterns, or like Warren Buffet actually manage the companies you own
    to perform better than average. The idea that a passive approach to equities implies
    higher-than-average returns puts you at the mercy of brokers who may be selling
    diamonds in the rough, but usually are selling hope (
