    a vast number of things we have no way of making ourselves, from our iPad to our

    even if we wanted to, our productivity would be insufficient to feed everyone.

    of the butcher and blacksmith incented them to create goods and services that,
    in a competitive market, lead to specialization, cost minimization, and gains
    from trade. As a businessman, profit is one of the better signals of value out
    there simply because everyone else likes profit too, so you have identified an
    area where you are literally creating value. This is a highly counterintuitive
    point, and so most people simply don't believe self-interest is consistent with
    a good society, because that's not how their family works.

    well. However, there is reciprocal altruism, basically helping other who can help
    you regardless of genome, and this is where it truly pays to understand how to
    service a customer--but only for the end-result of making money! It happens all

    haven't thought about it, because a society of that much love would be really

    no customer that will pay for self-indulgent status climbing in irrelevant hierarchies,
    regardless of how much we encourage our kids to play such games. That is, ping
    pong is a fabulous avocation, a pathetic vocation. We all want our children to
    play and engage in poetry, and when they excel at these things we are rightfully
    proud. Yet these are things kids do to develop skills like discipline, creativity,
    courage, that ultimately are valuable because of what they can do for others.

- en: A similar quandary comes up in other domains such as science. The objectivity
    of science is not primarily from the integrity of scientists, but by scientists
    competing with others about how to explain the real world. As the left-brain is
    constantly rationalizing beliefs and data it receives from the right side, rationalization
    is the default method of reasoning whether we like to admit it or not. It helps
    to be on the side of truth because it's a lot easier and more fruitful, but it
    is not essential, and generally we make some base assumptions off our intuitions
    and then apply an 'anything goes' rhetorical style. It is naive to present your
    side of some scientific debate as being better because it is filled with people
    of integrity, as all sides in any large debate involve omitting inconvenient data
    and exaggerating the consistent data. They key is being on the right side, having
    the right biases, prejudices, assumptions, because confabulation is hard-wired
    into the human mind.

    thing is having the correct foresight to see the long-run, as in the long run
    the truth or value will win out. Having empathy for the customer or a respect
    for the truth in science is helpful in achieving those ends because you are better
    able to correct yourself before becoming too tied to bad causes via sunk costs
    and golden handcuffs. Day-to-day a simple focus on profits cuts through a lot
    of confused thinking about vague concepts like 'serving our customers', a subject
    that has produced its share of tiresome essays. Alternatively, nonprofits do this
    all the time if you really enjoy that kind of focus, or you can go off
