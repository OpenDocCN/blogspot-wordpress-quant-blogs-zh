- en: Wow. So the executives who spent a decade laundering billions of dollars will
    have to *partially* defer their bonuses during the five-year deferred prosecution
    agreement? Are you fucking kidding me? That's the punishment? The government's
    negotiators couldn't hold firm on forcing HSBC officials to *completely* wait
    to receive their ill-gotten bonuses? They had to settle on making them "partially"
    wait? Every honest prosecutor in America has to be puking his guts out at such
    bargaining tactics. What was the Justice Department's opening offer – asking executives
    to restrict their Caribbean vacation time to nine weeks a year?

    position? Exactly how much money should one extract from a firm that has been
    shamelessly profiting from business with criminals for years and years? Remember,
    we're talking about a company that has admitted to a smorgasbord of serious banking
    crimes. If you're the prosecutor, you've got this bank by the balls. So how much
    money should you take?

    started its illegal activity? How about you dive into every bank account of every
    single executive involved in this mess and take every last bonus dollar they've
    ever earned? Then take their houses, their cars, the paintings they bought at
    Sotheby's auctions, the clothes in their closets, the loose change in the jars
    on their kitchen counters, every last freaking thing. Take it all and don't think
    twice. And *then* throw them in jail.
