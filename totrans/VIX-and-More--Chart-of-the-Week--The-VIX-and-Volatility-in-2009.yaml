    I take a look back at the entire year as seen through the eyes of the VIX and
    volatility. The first thing you see in this heavily annotated chart is that while
    the graph of the S&P 500 index for the year looks like a checkmark (a dip down
    to the March lows followed by a rally), volatility as measured by both the VIX
    and the [average true range](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/average%20true%20range)
    of the SPX declined in almost a straight line over the course of the year. In
    other words, volatility was much less sensitive to market declines in 2009 than
    it had been in prior years.

    later before the SPX finally found a bottom. Part of the explanation for mean
    reversion in the VIX leading [mean reversion](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/mean%20reversion)
    in the SPX is likely due to [behavioral finance](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/behavioral%20finance)
    factors such as those I described in [Availability Bias and Disaster Imprinting](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/11/availability-bias-and-disaster.html).

    highest mean VIX for the year (31.48, behind 2008’s record of 32.68) and the highest
    annual low for the VIX (19.25) since the VIX was launched in 1993.

- en: The chart shows some of the major events on the volatility landscape over the
    course of the year, as well as other events (black text) that had a limited impact
    on volatility. Notably absent from the second half of the year is any sort of
    sustained rise in volatility. Instead, volatility events were short-lived and
    with one exception, not able to push the VIX over 30\. I find it interesting that
    while rumors of a large U.S. bank in trouble or even the Dubai debt crisis failed
    to elevate the VIX above 30, the one event that did push the VIX above 30 was
    more of a trading event (a reversal in the dollar carry trade) than an economic
    or geopolitical threat to stocks.
