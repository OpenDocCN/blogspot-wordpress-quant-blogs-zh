    were anticipating an immanent take-over bid (stock fell 25% today). Keycorp, Fifth
    Third, Bank of Novia Scotia, KKR, and Warburg Pincus all found Nat City too expensive
    to buy at the current price, 75% below last year''s level. Thus, instead of paying
    existing shareholders a premium on the thought that the current stock price is
    too cheap, new investors are demanding existing shareholders get diluted in order
    to get an equity stake. You couldn''t find one financial institution to see value
    here, and so it seems that unlike 1990, bank prices are not ''too low''--other
    banks in the know see this and turn away. Thus the indicator is a two-fer: banks
    issuing equity indicates their stock prices are ''too high'', and potential buyers
    (all banks) think current prices are ''too high''. Citibank, RBS[today!], and
    Wachovia, also issued equity recently. The fact that so many banks are issuing
    equity, and not being taken over, suggests that our current swoon is seen by insiders
    as justified.'

    issuance. For instance, it is well known that if you buy an IPO, you better have
    bought it as an insider at the IPO price. If so, you make about 12% on the first
    day on average. After that, from the close of the first day, it will actually
    lag the market a considerable amount (Jay Ritter has an excellent set of data
    on this at his website

    tend to signal an overbought equity price. I have a bunch of references to this

    that the price is too high, and buy it back when it's too low.

    thinks the price is too low, and a seller who thinks it's too high. A simplification,
    to be sure, but probably an accurate approximation. So if you are buying from
    the ultimate insider, ya think there might be a good reason to expect the insider
    to get the better of the deal?

    won't grant them full biopsy rights, but there's no precedent or statute on this,
    so I'm crossing my fingers). Therefore, the recent announcements by major banks
    issuing equity is one big countersignal to my otherwise

    being marked below 'true value' because of selling for reasons unrelated to new
    information, one would think strong banks would be buying distressed banks on
    the cheap, the way JPMorgan picked up Bear Stearns (which probably was mainly
    a run, as opposed to a more fundamental insolvency). It appears that banks don't
    think this is mainly a liquidity issue, but more fundamental.
