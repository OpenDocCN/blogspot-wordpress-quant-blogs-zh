    with consulting projects. The long overdue  post on the CVI will be up soon, and
    I think most of you will find it extremely interesting. An astute trader and friend
    of the blog–Ramon Cummins–has done some additional research on DV Bands across
    several different instruments to test for robustness. Below is an excerpt of the
    email Ramon sent me:'

    I coded up a system in Amibroker to test the efficacy of the DV Bands across a
    portfolio of four watchlists, with average results below and detailed individual
    ticker results in the excel file attached. Some notes;

    ‘contained’ the closing price the next day.

    8% more of the time than traditional Bollinger Bands.
