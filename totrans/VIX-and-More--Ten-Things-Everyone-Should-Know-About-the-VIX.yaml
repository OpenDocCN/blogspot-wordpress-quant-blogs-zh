    investor fear in their marketing of the VIX and VIX-related products. As the CBOE
    puts it, “since volatility often signifies financial turmoil, [the] VIX is often
    referred to as the ‘investor fear gauge’”. The media has been quick to latch onto
    the headline value of the VIX as a fear indicator and has helped to reinforce
