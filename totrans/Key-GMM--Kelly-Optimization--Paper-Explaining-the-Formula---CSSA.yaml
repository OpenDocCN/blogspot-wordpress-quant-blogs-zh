    applied to sports betting (discrete bets) and the  kelly criterion for financial
    markets by Ed Thorp that is based on continuous time.  The financial kelly application
    is derived from the latter to account for the lack of defined payoffs or losses
    that exist in the markets. The method for applying the financial kelly application
    for portfolio optimization shares some similarities with conventional mean-variance
    optimization in that it uses the covariance matrix to account for differences
    in the relationship between assets . However, the kelly method is designed to
    maximize the compounded return while classic optimization maximizes the arithmetic
    sharpe ratio. Based on several inquiries, I have decided to provide a helpful
    link beyond the original Thorp paper: [http://www.bjmath.com/bjmath/thorp/paper.htm](http://www.bjmath.com/bjmath/thorp/paper.htm)
    Javier Estrada wrote a key paper about the Kelly optimization that I like to call
    “GMM” or geometric mean maximization. The paper can be found here: [http://www.fma.org/NY/Papers/Estrada-GMM.pdf](http://www.fma.org/NY/Papers/Estrada-GMM.pdf)
    . Suffice to say the math is not terribly difficult but certainly not like programming
    a technical indicator and requires the use of covariance matrices. This is only
    for the tech and quant saavy, but can be more easily replicated using statistical
    software such as “R” (which is what we used) or MATLAB.'

    unique based on the specific application. Clever individuals can certainly replicate
    what was done to a large extent. The purpose of the article on creating an intermarket
    ensemble was to demonstrate how classical portfolio theory can assist with the
    adaptive signal aggregation process. This method is not linear and helps to account
    for the relationships between signals that regression often fails to address explicitly
    via a least squares method. As a consequence the output is superior and presents
    a malleable framework for more sophisticated usage.
