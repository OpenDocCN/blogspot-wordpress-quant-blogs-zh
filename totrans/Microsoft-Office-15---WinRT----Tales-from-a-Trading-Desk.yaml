    will offer, apart from it being ‚Äúthe most ambitious undertaking yet for the Office

    Given the investment Microsoft is making in Metro and the WinRT, should we expect
    a WinRT Office? I suspect Office 15 will not be tied to WinRT, since this would
    restrict Office 15 sales to Windows 8, an OS that appears more for the consumer
    than the enterprise ‚Äì especially as so many corporations are still on Windows
