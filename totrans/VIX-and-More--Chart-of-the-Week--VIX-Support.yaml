- en: In this week’s [chart of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week),
    I have created a chart of the VIX going back to June 2007 which uses weekly bars
    to show that just about the time stocks made their 2007 pre-crisis highs, the
    VIX was establishing the 17-18 area (yellow bar) as a zone of support.

    17-18 zone before bouncing higher. In fact, the one time the VIX has made its
    most impressive break below the 17-18 zone was back in April, just before the
    [European sovereign debt crisis](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/European%20sovereign%20debt%20crisis)
    hit and pushed the VIX all the way up to 48.20, which just happens to be the highest
    VIX level recorded outside of the financial crisis of 2008-2009.

    buy VIX puts for March, April and May of 2011 for less than half the price of
    what the December 2010 puts are currently being offered.
