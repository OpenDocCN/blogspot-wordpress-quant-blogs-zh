    in itself bring a degree of fun and games üòâ¬† Before flights, I like to ensure
    I‚Äôve got enough reading and coding material.¬† Hence today, its a bit of pre-coding
    to ensure I‚Äôm ready for tonight‚Äôs flight, and a re-cap to the coding challenge
    I was working on a few weeks ago.¬† Very quickly this morning I ran into the classic
    clone() [method](http://javanirvana.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/why-clone-method-is-protected.html)
    [madness](http://howtodoinjava.com/2012/11/08/a-guide-to-object-cloning-in-java/)
    of Java.

    advertise that they permit cloning. Unfortunately it fails to serve this purpose
    ‚Ä¶ This is a highly atypical use of interfaces and not one to be emulated ‚Ä¶ In
    order for implementing the interface to have any effect on a class, it and all
    of its superclasses must obey a¬†**fairly complex, unenforceable and largely undocumented
    protocol***'

    coding tonight, which if I have time will also incur some DAG work on the server.
