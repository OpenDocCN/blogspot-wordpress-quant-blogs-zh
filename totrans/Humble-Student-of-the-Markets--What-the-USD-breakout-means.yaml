    to lend the US Treasury money at 2.4% for 10 years. With inflation, depending
    on how you measure it, at or slightly below 2%, it implies a real yield of 0.4-0.7%.

    "safe" asset yields. Today, the 10-year Bund yields is 1.0% and US Treasuries
    represent a 1.4% spread over Bunds! Not only that, Spanish 10-year yields are
    at roughly the same 2.4% level and Italian yields are only slightly higher at
    2.6%! UK 10-year yields are also at about 2.4%.

    no doubt partly a reflection of demand for USD assets, with Treasury paper a prime
    beneficiary of this trend, which is bullish for the prices of US Treasury paper.

    3 times. Where I come from triple bottoms and triple tops are very very rare,
    if they even exist at all. In all likelihood, as I mentioned on Fox Business in
    late May, we’ll see a 4th or 5th test that eventually cracks the support. Well
    as we can see in this chart, we’re seeing just that: a 4th test of support in
    a commodity that is still in a 3+ year downtrend:'

    also emblematic of the headwinds facing the commodity complex if the USD were
    to continue to rise, as commodities and the USD tend to be inversely correlated.

- en: I would agree with Parets assessment of the silver outlook and add that the
    silver-gold relationship is flashing warning signs for gold itself. As the top
    panel of the gold price chart shows, gold is showing a triangle wedge formation
    indicating indecision. An upside or downside breakout would indicate the next
    direction for gold. However, the bottom silver-gold ratio, which measures the
    more volatile silver price as a barometer for the precious metal complex, is showing
    weakness. The ratio is nearing a test of relative support. Should that support
    line break, it would have bearish implications for precious metals. Given the
    renewed strength in the USD, further weakness in gold, silver and other commodities
    is the more likely outcome.

    and forget the inter-connected nature of asset prices. This is just a little reminder
    of the importance of inter-market analysis.
