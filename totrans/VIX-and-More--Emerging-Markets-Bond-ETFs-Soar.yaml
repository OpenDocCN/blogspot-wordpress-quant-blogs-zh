    for equities (see links below), emerging markets bonds have been even stronger
    performers in 2010, both on an absolute and risk-adjusted basis. In fact, if one
    compares the chart of emerging markets bonds below, the gap between emerging markets
    and developed markets looks strikingly similar to what was seen on the equity
    side in [Chart of the Week: Rethinking Geography](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/08/chart-of-week-rethinking-geography.html).'

    PowerShares Emerging Markets Sovereign Debt Portfolio ETF) back in October 2008
    in the context of an indicator of the strength of the global economic in general
    and emerging markets in particular. Since that time, PCY has been an extremely
    strong performer, gaining 35.6% in 2009 and adding another 13.0% so far in 2010\.
    Along the way, PCY has attracted completion in the form of [EMB](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EMB),
    the iShares USD Emerging Market Bond ETF, which was up 15.4% in 2009 and is up
    11.5% year-to-date in 2010\. Of course both PCY and EMB have been able to post
    these excellent returns with only a fraction of the risk of their equity market
    counterparts.

    that have a much higher weighting in developed markets than emerging markets.
    Of these two the more liquid is SPDR Barclays Capital International Treasury Bond
    ETF ([BWX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/BWX)); the S&P/Citigroup
    International Treasury Bond ETF ([IGOV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/IGOV))
    is a relative newcomer. A shorter duration option in this space is the S&P/Citigroup
    1-3 Year International Treasury Bond ETF ([ISHG](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/ISHG)).

    over local and regional risk and reward. Without the sovereign debt problems,
    zombie banks and housing bubbles, emerging market debt is an attractive place
    to diversify a portfolio and capture a relatively high yield, such as the 5% or
    so [currently available](http://www.invescopowershares.com/products/overview.aspx?ticker=PCY)
    from PCY.
