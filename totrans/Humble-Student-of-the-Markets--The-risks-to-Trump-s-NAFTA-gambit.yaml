    on a handshake agreement between the United States and Mexico. The White House
    has also positioned the deal as a take-it-or-leave-it offer to Canada to join
    the agreement by Friday, which has also raised the anticipation level on the prospect
    that trade tensions are going to ease.

    comprehensive NAFTA agreement, but the characterization that a deal as imminent
    is a high risk strategy for Trump that may backfire on him.
