    the NASDAQ 100, which would have strong bullish implications if either index were
    to stage upside breakouts. While investors wait for those breakouts, here is a
    cup and handle that has staged a definitive upside breakout on both an absolute
    basis and relative to the S&P 500\. It was made by the NYSE FANG+ Index, which
    represents megacap growth stocks.

    that investors and traders should embrace a market melt-up scenario into year-end
    and possibly beyond.
