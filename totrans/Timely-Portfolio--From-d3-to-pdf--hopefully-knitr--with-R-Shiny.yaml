    team the best, I could definitely envision a big need for multi-page pdf reports
    created with R, [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/), and latex delivered to the
    browser with [Shiny](http://rstudio.com/shiny).  Shiny helpfully provides pre-built
    functionality to send .png charts and graphics created by R to the web.  This
    works especially well since most browsers offer containers for the graphics that
    can dynamically change.

    hoped for knit2pdf to see if sending the binary pdf data is possible.  ~~It seems
    the downloadHandler function from Shiny only currently handles text.~~  The downloadHandler
    function from Shiny also serves up downloads well.  I have included the code to
    get that to work also if you prefer this behavior.

    It seems to work with the newest Chrome and IE.
