    breadth indicators. One indicator I track that finally spiked up to an extreme
    reading Monday is the Capitulative Breadth Indicator (CBI). It now stands at 12
    and could spike quite a bit higher on Tuesday if the market fails to rally. I’ve
    discussed in the past that there is a strong bullish edge when the CBI moves over
    10\. A “system” I’ve discussed in the past is buying the S&P when the CBI reaches
    10 or above and then selling when it returns to 3 or lower. This system was perfect
    from 1995 until July 2008\. In July it suffered its 1st loss and in October it
    suffered its 2nd loss. November spike above 10 nailed the bottom and turned into
    the a 19% gain - the biggest ever for the system. Some detailed statistics are
    below ($100k/trade, 1995-present):'
