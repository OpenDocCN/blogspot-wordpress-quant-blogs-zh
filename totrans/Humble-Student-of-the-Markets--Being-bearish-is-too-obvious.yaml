    Wednesday because I have an appointment just before the close so many of the charts
    won''t have Wednesday''s closing prices. The market structure continues to be
    bearish, and I continue to believe that the intermediate-term trend is down. Nevertheless,
    it''s too obvious to be bearish, so I''m resisting that urge.'
