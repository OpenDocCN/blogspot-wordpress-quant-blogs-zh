    on that direction, but since it looks as if indecision is becoming prevalent in
    the area of SPX 840-850, I thought it might be time to turn to a tangential subject.

- en: '[Gio: The Hawaii Trader](http://ibankcoin.com/gioblog/), has a post covering
    last week’s action with the title, [Weekly Review: Using VIX Reversals to Spot
    Intraday Market Reversals…Over and Over and Over](http://ibankcoin.com/gioblog/?p=2773).
    As the title suggests, Gio claims that during periods of extreme market volatility
    the VIX often turns in advance of the broader markets and can therefore be used
    as a day trading tool. Unfortunately, at least to my eye, I find the accompanying
    chart provided by Gio to be inconclusive at best. To my (admittedly slightly astigmatic)
    eye, the DJI turns prior to the VIX in three or four of the five examples he cites.'

    that occasionally lags turns in the SPX during periods of extreme market volatility
    – a phenomenon that I documented repeatedly during the last four months of 2008\.
    My belief is that when the markets are falling rapidly and the VIX is spiking,
    investors frequently buy puts aggressively on the bounces, particularly when then
    fear the resumption of a bear trend. Very rarely have I witnessed the VIX turning
    before the SPX during periods of high volatility.

    would certainly be interested in hearing about the perspectives and experiences
    of other traders regarding the VIX as a day trading signal and as a leading or
    lagging indicator.
