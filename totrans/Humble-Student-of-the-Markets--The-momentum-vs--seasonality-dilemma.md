# Humble Student of the Markets: The momentum vs. seasonality dilemma

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2020/10/the-momentum-vs-seasonality-dilemma.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2020/10/the-momentum-vs-seasonality-dilemma.html#0001-01-01)

I have some good news and bad news. The good news is the option market isn't as concerned about the prospect of a contested election. The chart below shows the history of the term structure of at-the-money implied volatility (IV). The latest readings shows that IV spikes just after Election Day, and deflates slowly afterward. The bad news is it took a -1.9% decline in the S&P 500 to invert the term structure to create this condition.
