# Quantifiable Edges: A Study Suggesting Short-term Downside

Below is a study that has been shown a few times in the

[Subscriber Letter](http://www.quantifiableedges.com/gold.html)

. It popped up last night via

[the Quantifinder](http://www.quantifiableedges.com/quantifinderinfo.html)

. It looks at what happens when two days of strong breadth fail to take the SPX to a new 10-day intraday high. I’ve re-run the stats and posted them below.

The failure to make a 10-day high after two strong up days suggests there was a strong move down prior to this. Most often the strong down move will reassert itself or at least cause a pullback. As a point of comparison, below are the numbers when the back-to-back the strength does coincide with a 10-day high:

Strong negative expectations turn positive under this scenario. I've shown before how

[positioning is important](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2009/02/importance-of-positioning-in-analysis.html)

when interpreting action. This is another example of that.
