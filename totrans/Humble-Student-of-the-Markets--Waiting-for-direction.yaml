    The directionless choppiness has combined to create a climate of maximum frustration
    for many professionals that I have talked to. Unfortunately, the volatility is
    likely to continue and I am still waiting for signs of direction.

    weakening and defensive leadership continues to be dominant. Consider the chart
    below of the relative performance of Consumer Discretionary (XLY) against the
    market (SPY). This sector, which had been the leadership close to two years, has
    declined through a relative performance trendline, which indicates faltering relative
    strength.

    story. Cyclical stocks remain in a relative downtrend against the market, with
    no bottom in sight. If there is an economic rebound, then it should show up in
    this sector. This weakness is confirmed by recent downbeat comments by

    on stocks declined again, marking the ninth time in eleven months that the indicator
    has fallen. The 0.8 ppt decline pushed the indicator down to 49.3, the first time
    below 50 in nearly 15 years, suggesting that ***sell side strategists are now
    more bearish on equities than they were at any point during the collapse of the
    Tech Bubble or the recent Financial Crisis***. Given the contrarian nature of
    this indicator, we are encouraged by Wall Street's lack of optimism and the fact
    that strategists are recommending that investors significantly underweight equities
    vs. a traditional long-term average benchmark weighting of 60-65%.
