- en: 'Note that the +/- addition, as in grades you got in college, just adds further
    granularity (Moody''s uses the less obvious 1,2 and 3 suffixes, 1 being +, 3 being
    -), but with the following exception: there is no AAA+ or AAA-! So AAA to AA+
    is one ''notch''. The main thing to realize is the default rates are approximately
    log linear in ratings category, and I would say this is a general law. People
    perceive things in log space (decibels, Richter scales, brightness, acidity),
    and so an "AA" is 2-5x as risky as an AAA.'

    because ratings agencies compile these default studies themselves and self-servingly
    exclude various data points (note the complete absence of AAA defaults even though
    several AAA mortgage-backed CDOs went down, because ABS aren't included in the
    general tables!). It's basically impossible to compile these without some regulatory
    authority, and it would be straightforward and very useful.

- en: Yet it appears ratings are pretty good ordinal rankings over 5-10 years. The
    key is that moving from AAA to AA+ is in one sense small (0.03% in annual default
    rate), another a paradigm shift, from the state where risk is 'as low as conceivable'
    to not, and this will focus Treasury buyers on the real probability of a US default
    ($14T in debt, but if you include social security, medicare and medicaid, it is
