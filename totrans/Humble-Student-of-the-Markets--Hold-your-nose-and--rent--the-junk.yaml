    the low-quality theme makes sense as a trade. The way to participate is through
    the use of the Phoenix strategy.

    arguably it has been a period of anemic economic growth, so the situation for
    many companies isn't as dire as it was in late 2008 and early 2009\. Nevertheless,
    Phoenix does make sense as a way to participate in the "dash for trash" theme.

- en: This is obviously a high risk approach and I would take the following steps
    to control risk. First of all, determine how much of your portfolio you want to
    put into this strategy as 100% commitment is not suitable for pretty much everyone.
    Second, diversification is critical. I have received feedback when I last issued
    the call to buy into the Phoenix strategy about this stock or that stock not working
    out. If you do employ this strategy, you should buy a basket of these stocks and
    not focus on just one or two names.

    well, define your risk tolerance carefully, either on an individual stock basis

    strategy now is being late in the game. However, as equity underweight investors
    rush to get into the stocks, this strategy should yield some decent returns if
    my investment thesis is correct. One important component of this approach is to
    watch momentum indicators carefully. When they start to turn down, then it's time
    to get out.
