- en: 'The bottom line is that the attempt to save bank bondholders from losses –
    to provide monetary compensation without economic production – is not sound economic
    policy but is instead a grand monetary experiment that has never been tried in
    the developed world except in Germany circa 1921\. This policy can only have one
    of two effects: either it will crowd out over $1 trillion of gross domestic investment
    that would otherwise have occurred if the appropriate losses had been wiped off
    the ledger (instead of making bank bondholders whole), or it will result in a
    stunning and durable increase in the quantity of base money, which will ultimately
    be accompanied not by a year or two of 5-6% inflation, but most probably by a
    near-doubling of the U.S. price level over the next decade. As I''ve noted previously,
    the growth rate of government spending is better correlated with subsequent inflation
    than even growth in money supply itself, particularly at 4-year intervals. ***Regardless
    of near-term deflation pressures from a continued mortgage crisis, our present
    course is consistent with double digit inflation once any incipient recovery emerges.***'

    levels. Weimar Republic or Zimbabwe style hyperinflation in triple or quadruple
    digits is unlikely at this point.

    by other states but collectively cause dysfunction. These begin with the requirement
    that any budget pass both houses of the legislature with a two-thirds majority.
    Two other states, Rhode Island and Arkansas, have such a law. But ***California,
    where taxation and budgets are determined separately***, also requires two-thirds
    majorities for any tax increase. Twelve other states demand this. Only California,
    however, has both requirements.

    or decades, but the lack of willingness of the current administration to address
    the growing shortfall shows that they are more similar to the Bush, Jr., administration,
    than different from it. After all, who ran the biggest deficits? Obama, by a long
    shot.
