    to be an excellent way to identify the issues that are resonating with readers
    and also to see how these issues evolve over time. These most-read posts also
    serve as easily accessible repositories of high-quality material for the benefit
    of new readers and long-term readers alike.

- en: A number of themes seem to be top of mind for 2103 so far. Clearly the [VIX
    ETPs](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20ETN) and their construction
    and valuation quirks continue to be a huge issue, as is their performance during
    various volatility regimes. On a related note, low volatility ETPs generated considerable
    press and interest toward the beginning of the year and as volatility picked up
    in the second quarter, readers gravitated toward information on [VIX spikes](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20spikes)
    and various ways to measure and evaluate [risk](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/risk).

    unique readers during the first half of 2013\. Farther down there are links to
    similar lists going back to 2008, along with several other “best of” type posts
    that I have flagged for [archival](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/archival)
    purposes.

    label to a handful of posts that I believe have particularly compelling and/or
    original content, regardless of readership.
