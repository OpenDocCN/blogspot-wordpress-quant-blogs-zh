    [smells](http://martinfowler.com/articles/itsNotJustStandingUp.html).  All to
    often the board is updated or the electronic board is updated during the scrum,
    focusing the team on a more admin task than anything else.  Classic madness.

    sure everyone is clear as to the over arching theme/goal of the sprint.

    late, and just looking bored.  The scrum is for the team, the team should feel
    they benefit from the scrum, not that its a chore.
