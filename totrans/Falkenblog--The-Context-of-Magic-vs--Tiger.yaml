    who must come clean and ask forgiveness. Another guy has hundreds if not thousands
    of affairs, in the process acquiring HIV, thus exposing his poor wife.

    was sincere pity, poor Magic. In contrast, the venom inspired by Tiger's actions
    is rather severe.

    or important, is rarely seen in isolation, but as a member of a larger class.
    Magic was announcing he had HIV when the politics of AIDS were especially large,
    and 'blaming the victim' was not politically correct so he got the appropriate
    pity, regardless of his reckless behavior. Tiger doesn't have any such angle.

    a bunch of hypocrites. Your average true believer rationalizes exceptions to their
    world view, sacrifices various smaller principles to larger ones. This is the
    right thing to do, just as murdering Hitler is morally good thing to do if you
    had a time machine, and saw him in 1938, or ignoring

    by current politics, posterity, and one's own conscience. Clearly, the easiest
    way to go through life is to see what is popular, and shade one's prejudices appropriately,
    so 150 years ago it would be proper to be a racist and think that the 'upper class'
    was a thoroughly different beast, whereas today smarmy college freshman at top
    colleges think every human grouping possible has equal genetic ability and interest
    in every meaningful human dimension. People never get rid of their prejudices,
    they just change them.

    truth of what? No one lies like the indignant because they feel their big point
    is being obscured by unfair tactics, and so feel justified in fighting fire with
    fire to acheive their ultimate, good aim (which, because it is good, is also true).
