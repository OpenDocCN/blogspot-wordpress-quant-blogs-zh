## SQL Server 2008 Express Mixed Mode Authentication – How to Enable?

I finally found the answer [here](http://vakul.wordpress.com/2009/02/12/configure-microsoft-sql-server-for-mixed-mode-authentication/). Now my problem is that since I installed SQL Server 2008 Express via VS 2010 Ultimate Beta 2, how do I install the Full-text search feature when VS 2010 Maintenance Mode doesn’t appear to know about SQL Server 2008 Express 😦
