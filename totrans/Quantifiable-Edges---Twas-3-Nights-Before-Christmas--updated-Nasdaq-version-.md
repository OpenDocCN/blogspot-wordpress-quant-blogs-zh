I’ve been posting and updating the “Twas 3 Nights Before Christmas” study

[on the blog here since 2008](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2008/12/twas-3-nights-before-christmas.html)

.  The study will kick in at today’s close.  This year I will again show the Nasdaq version of the study.  While all the major indices have performed well during this period, the Nasdaq Composite stands out as the big winner.

The stats in this table are strong across the board, and the note at the bottom shows reliability that has been nothing short of incredible.  Traders may want to keep this one in mind over the next couple of weeks.
