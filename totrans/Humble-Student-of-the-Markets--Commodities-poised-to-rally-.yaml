- en: Much has been made of the upside technical breakout experienced by the US Dollar
    last week, but when I dissect the components of USD strength, I found that much
    of the breakout was attributable to Yen weakness. In fact, the other components
    of USD are all testing support, which suggests that the euro and commodities are
    poised to rally here.

  zh: 美元上周经历的上行技术突破备受关注，但当我分析美元走强的因素时，发现突破很大程度上是由于日元的走弱。实际上，美元的其他组成部分都在测试支撑位，这表明欧元和大宗商品可能在这里上涨。

    The commodity sensitive Aussie Dollar is also testing a key technical support

  zh: 大宗商品弱势的故事众所周知。对中国的增长失望是主要驱动力，但硬币的另一面是美元的走强。与大宗商品相关的澳元也在测试一个关键的技术支撑区域：

- en: In fact, if you were to consider the EURAUD cross as a measure of the strength
    of Europe, the euro is turning up against the commodity sensitive Aussie Dollar
    as it has staged an upside breakout through a resistance level. Viewed in that
    context, is the euro that weak or is it just weak against the USD?

  zh: 实际上，如果你将EURAUD交叉汇率作为衡量欧洲强弱的指标，欧元正在对抗与大宗商品相关的澳元，因为它已经突破了一个阻力位，实现了向上的突破。从这个角度来看，欧元是否真的很弱，还是只是相对于美元而言显得弱？

    Yen are sitting on technical support. I also wrote to watch for the re-test of
    the recent bottom in gold as a clue to market direction (see

- en: All of these conditions are lining up to suggest that commodities are poised
    to rebound. The euro, commodity sensitive currencies and gold are all at key technical
    support levels. As I write these words, precious metal prices are substantially
    in the red. Watch for signs of stabilization, or better yet, reversal on the day.
    If that were to happen, expect that the rotation back into cyclical sectors will
    continue and stock prices to continue to grind higher.

  zh: 所有这些条件都表明大宗商品即将反弹。欧元、与大宗商品相关的货币以及黄金都处于关键的技术支撑位。在我写下这些话的时候，贵金属价格大幅下跌。关注市场稳定或更好的反转迹象。如果出现这种情况，预计周期性部门的轮动将延续，股市将继续缓慢上涨。
