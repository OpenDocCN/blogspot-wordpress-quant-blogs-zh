    last week, but when I dissect the components of USD strength, I found that much
    of the breakout was attributable to Yen weakness. In fact, the other components
    of USD are all testing support, which suggests that the euro and commodities are
    poised to rally here.

    has been a principal driver, but the flip side of that coin has been USD strength.
    The commodity sensitive Aussie Dollar is also testing a key technical support

    of Europe, the euro is turning up against the commodity sensitive Aussie Dollar
    as it has staged an upside breakout through a resistance level. Viewed in that
    context, is the euro that weak or is it just weak against the USD?

    to rebound. The euro, commodity sensitive currencies and gold are all at key technical
    support levels. As I write these words, precious metal prices are substantially
    in the red. Watch for signs of stabilization, or better yet, reversal on the day.
    If that were to happen, expect that the rotation back into cyclical sectors will
    continue and stock prices to continue to grind higher.
