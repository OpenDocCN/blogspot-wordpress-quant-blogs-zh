    Now there are rumours that Merrill is negotiating an end to it’s independence
    with Bank of America [update:it’s no longer just a rumour] . Could Morgan Stanley,
    or even (whisper it) Goldman’s be next ?

    We used to have independent investment banks like Morgan Grenfell, Barings, Warburgs
    & Fleming. They all collapsed or sold out ten or more years back. Now our American
    colleagues are following the trail we blazed !

    – institutions that combine retail, commercial, wholesale & private banking with
    broker dealer trading operations and asset management. I guess this is more validation
    of that model…

    IT people there. They’ll all lose their jobs, and are unlikely to get any kind
    of pay off. No doubt BoA will lay off a lot of Merrill staff, but should give
    them a few months money.
