    of globalization as emerging market economies growth outperformed, wealth and
    income inequality within developed market countries have widened because the middle

    The winners were the top 1% and most of the emerging market world, while the losers
    were the poorest, largely because people in subsistence economies didn't participate

    few years. We collected data on all players drafted by NFL teams from 1996 to

    we test whether they have adequate savings by counting how many retired NFL players
    file for bankruptcy. ***Contrary to the life-cycle model predictions, we find
    that initial bankruptcy filings begin very soon after retirement and continue
    at a substantial rate through at least the first 12 years of retirement.*** Moreover,
    bankruptcy rates are not affected by a player’s total earnings or career length.

    is what causes the achievement gap. Along with Levitt, he found something very
    interesting. In kindergarten, the black-white gap can be entirely explained by
    a small number of variables, including socioeconomic status. But as the kids got
    older, a new racial gap appeared that wasn’t explained by those factors. That
    means that some other force is at work -- education, discrimination, cultural
    factors or something else.

    that black culture discourages intellectual achievement, by branding academic
    pursuits as “acting white.” Along with co-author Paul Torelli, Fryer [investigated](http://www.quantitativesocialscience.com/uploads/5/8/3/3/5833205/fryer_torelli_2010.pdf)
    the hypothesis. If academics are really considered “acting white,” then it stands
    to reason that getting good grades should be negatively correlated with popularity.
    Using data from a survey that asked students who their friends were, Fryer and
    Torelli constructed a measure of how popular each student was among members of
    his or her own race (the index is constructed so that having more popular friends
    confers more popularity than having less popular friends). The results fit the
    predictions of the “acting white” hypothesis -- as students get older, the correlation
    between grades and popularity goes up and up for white kids, but down for black
    kids.

    of the black-white achievement gap. Many teachers, if asked, will tell you that
    this is the case (though they will probably deny that the discrimination comes
    from their own classrooms!). It’s a very hard thing to measure. But, as Fryer
    and others have [documented](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.169.2586&rep=rep1&type=pdf),
    racial discrimination has become less and less important in the U.S. employment

    grade school level, but it is suggestive.
