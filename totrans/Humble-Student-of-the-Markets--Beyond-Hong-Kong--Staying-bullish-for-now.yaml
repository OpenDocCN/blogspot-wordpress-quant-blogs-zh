    risk aversion is rising. Should the index violate support at 22,600, then it would
    be a sign to get more defensive in their portfolios.

    and the Chinese economy. But there are other important indicators for China and
    for investor risk aversion. For instance, while the Hang Seng Index has been taking
    a tumble after their markets returned to work after the Lunar New Year, the Shanghai
    Composite has rallied in the same timeframe.

    but perhaps an indication of a minor pullback. Until we get a bearish consensus
    on these other indicators of investor risk aversion, I would be inclined to give
    the bulls the benefit of the doubt in the intermediate term.
