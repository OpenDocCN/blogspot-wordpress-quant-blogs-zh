    in the running for the [chart of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week).
    Given that the Bureau of Labor Statistics [corrected](http://www.bls.gov/ces/cescensusnote.htm)
    some of the historical data series and stocks rallied sharply off of the not-as-bad-as-feared
    payroll losses, this seemed like a good time to update a chart that has always
    been a big hit and I that I have not published in seven months.

- en: The chart below shows monthly changes in [nonfarm payroll employment](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/nonfarm%20payrolls)
    and the [unemployment rate](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/unemployment%20rate)
    going back to 1999 and captures the recent plateau in both measures. Note that
    in 2002 and early 2003, payroll data showed an occasional positive blip before
    sustained payroll growth began in the last quarter of 2003\. Also worth noting,
    the unemployment rate did not peak in 2003 until *20 months* after peak payroll
    losses that dated all the way back to October 2001.

    still make the case that there is not enough evidence that the employment situation
    has bottomed.
