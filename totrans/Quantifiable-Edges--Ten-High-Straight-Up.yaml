- en: I’ve previously discussed some of the findings in Larry Connors’ book “How Markets
    Really Work”. In the book Larry looks at certain market situations and determines
    whether the market has historically outperformed or underperformed when those
    situations arose. One I previously discussed was a 3-day rise in the market when
    it is trading under its 200-day moving average. Historically, the market has struggled
    to add further gains after this has occurred.

    In the book he shows there has been a negative expectancy over the next 1-5 days
    following a 10-day high. I have personally examined 10-day closing highs and found
    a negative expectancy 3-5 days out when the market is under its 200-day moving
    average. When it is over the 200-day the expectancy is no longer negative.

    a 10-day high and closed at a 10-day closing high. I ran some tests to see what
    happened when you combined some of these 10-high criteria with 3-straight up days.
    Results of the different combinations I looked at were similar. Below is one example:'

- en: A negative expectancy persisted up through 12-days out. The greatest part of
    it appeared in the 1st three days. Of course during the next three days there
    is going to be a Fed announcement. The reaction to that may have a larger affect
    on market movement than my little test. Still, it’s worthwhile noting the negative
    expectancy in these situations. Below is a chart showing all the recent instances
    with a 3-day exit strategy.
