Good afternoon, class. Welcome to another session of "Thinking Straight 101". Your assignment today is to choose one of the topics below and write an essay for next week's class:

*   **North Korea:** George Friedman at [Geopolitical Futures](https://geopoliticalfutures.com/north-korea-stares-abyss/) recently warned, "All the signs are there: The U.S. is telling North Korea, in no uncertain terms, that war is approaching." ***Discuss the probability of war.***
*   **Small cap technology buy signal**: [Marketwatch](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/these-tech-stocks-are-the-next-superstars-ready-for-a-breakout-2017-05-30) recently highlighted Jonathan Krinsky's bullish outlook for small cap Technology stocks. ***Disentangle the source of potential alpha in the buy signal.***
*   **China**: While there has been much angst over China's crackdown on the shadow banking system, there is a school of thought that, no matter what happens, Beijing can take steps to avoid a hard landing. ***Discuss the consequences of socializing losses.***

Each of the stated positions have their own inherent contradictions.
