- en: Since I explored the relationship between the [Japanese Yen and the US 10y Treasury
    Yield on Friday](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2012/01/are-we-japanese.html),
    I thought it might be worthwhile to extend the exploration to a much broader range
    of currencies. I personally am most interested on how Asian Central Bank manipulation
    has affected the US 10y yield, and how if that changes what might be the impact
    to world markets. Please let me know your thoughts.
