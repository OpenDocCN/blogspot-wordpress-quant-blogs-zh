# Humble Student of the Markets: Your (un-PC) Friday giggle

In the highly polarized, politicized and politically correct climate that is America, it is difficult to have a rational conversation about some topics, such as how to heal the rift with the Muslim world and community.

Perhaps the first step is to try to relax and laugh about it. Consider these two offerings from America's closest allies, which could never be produced in the United States under the current environment. The first comes from the UK and it's a film called

[The Infidel](http://infidelmovie.com/#/about-the-film/)

, which is about a middle-aged Muslim who discovers that he was adopted and that he is actually Jewish (see the trailer

[here](//www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMudF0MQgC0&feature=fvw)

).

The second, from Canada, is a long running TV series called Little Mosque on the Prairie, about a small group of Muslims who get together and run a mosque in a small prairie town (by renting the hall from the local Anglican parish no less). See the first episode

Go take a look. They are both hilarious.
