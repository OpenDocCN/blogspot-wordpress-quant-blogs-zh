    now, one of the crowded macro trades seems to be long US Dollar and, by implication
    of their negative correlations, short commodities. So what happens if this trade
    were to reverse itself? What the implications for the markets in general?

    The USD Index peaked out in March and has been moving sideways every since. Some
    minor bearish signs can be seen as the USD Index did breach its 50 dma today and
    RSI appears to be trending down, which indicates deteriorating momentum. However,
    these are not decisively bearish signals in the way that resource stocks appear
    bullish.

    Reserve has made noises in the past about its concerns about the strength of the
    US Dollar. A rising Dollar is a form of de facto tightening by importing deflation

    puts upward pressure on inflation and a faster pace of rate hikes becomes more
    likely.

- en: 'The mean monthly total return of the SP 500 is 0.65%. That return drops, but
    is still positive when the Fed Funds rate increases, to 0.45%. However, when the
    term premium between the 10y and Fed Funds rate is positive, the average return
    returns to 0.64%. When the term premium is above 1%, the average return is even
    higher than the sample mean – 0.82%! When adding the condition that the benchmark
    rate falls, the mean monthly return climbs to 1.27%. ***This tells us something
    very significant to the discussion: the price of SP 500 contains the expectation
    of monetary policy. Thusly, monetary policy tightening has not negatively impacted
    the SP 500 unless it happens more quickly than the market expects.*** In fact,
    both the 10y and the equity market don’t necessarily negatively react to Fed Funds
    hikes.'

    Shouldn't a falling Dollar be earnings positive?

    last summer, YoY comparisons of currency translation effects will still be negative
    for Q3 and Q4 earnings season. While a weaker USD may pose less of a headwind
    to earnings, it will still be a headwind for the roughly the next two earning
    seasons. It is unclear, however, how much USD strength is already baked into Street
    EPS estimates and therefore the effects of Dollar weakness on expectations is
    uncertain.

    same time, the US Dollar takes a breather and retreats against major currencies.
