    now, one of the crowded macro trades seems to be long US Dollar and, by implication
    of their negative correlations, short commodities. So what happens if this trade
    were to reverse itself? What the implications for the markets in general?

    BoAML Fund Manager Survey, which surveys a sample of mainly globally oriented
    institutional fund managers. The consensus crowded long is long USD.

    no surprise that global equity fund managers were hugely underweighted in the
    energy sector.

    a successful test of technical support while exhibiting positive RSI divergence,
    while WTI fell to new lows for this cycle.

    blatantly bullish tendencies, the USD Index chart is not as obviously bearish.
    The USD Index peaked out in March and has been moving sideways every since. Some
    minor bearish signs can be seen as the USD Index did breach its 50 dma today and
    RSI appears to be trending down, which indicates deteriorating momentum. However,
    these are not decisively bearish signals in the way that resource stocks appear
    bullish.

    inverse relationship. Assuming that the FOMC were to raise rates at their September
    meeting, the market would then focus on the pace of future rate hikes. Would there
    be another rate hike in December?

- en: This is where I believe the markets could force the Fed's hand. The Federal
    Reserve has made noises in the past about its concerns about the strength of the
    US Dollar. A rising Dollar is a form of de facto tightening by importing deflation
    and a weakening Dollar would import inflationary pressures. Dollar weakness therefore
    puts upward pressure on inflation and a faster pace of rate hikes becomes more
    likely.

    positive effect on earnings when the USD falls?" After all, unfavorable currency
    translation has proven to be a headwind for the earnings of many US multi-nationals.
    Shouldn't a falling Dollar be earnings positive?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The answer to that question is a qualified yes. The chart below of the Trade
    Weighted Dollar shows that the rise of the USD began about a year ago and peaked
    in March. The TWD has been mainly flat ever since.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unless the Dollar were to truly crater and retrace most of its gains that began
    last summer, YoY comparisons of currency translation effects will still be negative
    for Q3 and Q4 earnings season. While a weaker USD may pose less of a headwind
    to earnings, it will still be a headwind for the roughly the next two earning
    seasons. It is unclear, however, how much USD strength is already baked into Street
    EPS estimates and therefore the effects of Dollar weakness on expectations is
    uncertain.

    this is the start of a sustained bull or just a bounce in a downtrend. At the
    same time, the US Dollar takes a breather and retreats against major currencies.
    From a technical perspectives, these moves are overdue because of the crowded
    short in commodity and commodity-related stocks and a crowded long in the USD.
