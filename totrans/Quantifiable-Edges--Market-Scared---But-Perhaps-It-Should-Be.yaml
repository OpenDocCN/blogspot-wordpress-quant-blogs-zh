- en: 1) Brian C., sent me a study he did on VIX spikes hitting extreme levels. On
    Friday the VXO closed over 20% above its 10ma. I looked at this in a study and
    compared my results to his. They both said pretty much the same thing. More often
    than not the VXO spike leads to an S&P bounce fairly quickly. Those times that
    it doesn’t - watch out.

    least 2% in one day and then lost all of its gains and more the next day - similar
    to this Thursday and Friday. No need for an elaborate display of the results here.
    It only happened once - March 24, 2003\. In other words, 2% rises are simply not
    supposed to get wiped away in one day. There is no reliable precedent for what
    happens next.

    In a market that is selling off in an unprecedented way I’d be more comfortable
    taking a shot on the long side if this was spiking. Perhaps with a few more days
    of selling, but right now I’m not seeing anything that is screaming buy.
