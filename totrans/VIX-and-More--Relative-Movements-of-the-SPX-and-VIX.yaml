    the context of historical norms and above the upper Bollinger band – something

    that the SPX:VIX ratio now sits at the bottom Bollinger band and at a level relative
    to the SPX:VIX trend line (see that

    SPX:VIX ratio has bounced around in the 90-97 range, a move that brings it almost
    exactly halfway back to the 10% trend line and in close proximity to what I would
    consider a neutral range of 105-115\. My guess is that it will be more of a falling
    VIX than a rising SPX that will bring these ratios back toward neutral over the
    next week or two.

    about what the ratio suggests about future market movements. Right now it suggests
    that the SPX still has a fair amount of firming to do relative to the VIX before
    it gets to an area where I would be concerned about the SPX taking another dive.
