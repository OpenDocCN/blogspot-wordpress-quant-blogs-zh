    that is so central to its core appears fleetingly and parochially. Much of what
    distinguishes a PhD in finance or economics from a PhD in physics is that the
    former know a lot more about utility functions. Yet anyone working in finance
    sees this is hardly an intellectual asset that makes them more valuable, precisely
    because any risk premium derived via Stochastic Discount Functions and the like
    aren't very convincing to someone wanting to invest real money. The failure of
    this approach is best reflected by the absence of any value to finance/econ-specific
    quantitative rigor, which is mainly built around utility functions. I know a lot
    about these, and know they are a waste of time.

    to find risk premiums in the most bizarre cases. Consider this explanation for
    why highly levered stocks have lower than average equity returns (

    two reasons. First, distress costs depress asset payoffs in low states. Since
    the occurrence of low states is at least partly systematic, distress costs heighten
    exposure to systematic risk. Second, firms with high distress costs optimally
    utilize less leverage than firms with low costs. Since firms with high costs choose
    low leverage, low leverage firms will have the greatest exposure to systematic
    risk relating to distress costs. The cross section of expected returns will therefore
    be negatively related to leverage.

    with higher risk, higher leverage implies lower risk because such firms are actually
    less risky, which is why they have higher leverage. Never mind that higher leverage
    is associated with higher default rates, or that higher leverage is associated
    with higher volatility. Higher returning assets must be riskier, and so assets
    that have high volatility, default risk, etc., are just risky in a very subtle
    way because they must!
