    at Big Spaceship voices a view echoed by most [designers](http://www.bigspaceship.com/blog/labs/thoughts-on-silverlight-part-ii-design-and-animation/)
    – Expression Blend needs an OS X build. VMWare and Parallels work, but forcing
    all designers to install a VM just to run Blend when they spend their lives in
    OS X land using the Adobe suite is madness. I know Microsoft want to sell Windows,
    but on the flip side they also need to make it easy for designers to use Expression
    Blend.'

    I recommend it. I think there are times when it’ll be faster to build certain
    things in Silverlight than Flash and vice versa, and it is a matter of learning
    where the strengths and weaknesses are for each.”
