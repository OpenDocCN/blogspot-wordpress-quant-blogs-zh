    riding around on a motorcycle at 100mph without a helmet on. It doesn't necessarily
    mean that you get hurt. It just means that if you hit a bump in the road the damage
    will be very, very bad.

    news Friday is a typical "bump in the road". It remains to be seen what kind of
    damage it causes to market psychology and whether Goldman's failure to disclose
    the receipt of a Wells Notice is the beginning of a death spiral for the investment
    bank (or the market). My inner trader, on the other hand, tells me to stay with
    the positive momentum for now, watch for technical breaks and maintain very tight
    stops.

    the market action of the last few days have been the signs of technical breaks
    that I have watching for. The technical damage has been too great to ignore for
    the bulls and an intermediate term correction is most likely underway. The most
    important ones for me has been the action of the Shanghai Composite, which not
    only violated an uptrend but important support levels:'

    of the Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index against the SPX. Many investors have piled
    into the cyclical sector as they became convinced that a sustainable economic
    recovery is under way. These stocks have also broken a relative uptrend and support
    level:'

    moving average. We’ll see if that level holds.

    zone would be somewhere between 1050, the 50% Fibonacci retracement level, and
    about 1100, the 200-day moving average, which is also situated slightly above
    the 38% Fibonacci retracement.

    as the SPX. This index has already violated its 50-day moving average support
    level, but it’s still above the uptrend line that began in July 2009, which should
    provide an area of technical support.

    don’t go straight up or straight down. Even the Crash of 1987 began with a top
    in August, which sparked various trendline violations, and the Crash didn’t happen
    until October, a full two months later. In the near term, the market is likely
    to stage some sort of reflex rally from current levels. At that point, we need
    to watch for signs of how the psychology develops.

- en: Already I see a number of technicians calling for an intermediate term bottom
    at around the 1040 to 1100 level on the SPX. Given the weak action of the broader
    NYSE Composite, my best guess is that support materializes closer to 1040, which
    also coincides with the February lows. If the market does descends to those levels,
    how will market participants react should we approach those price zones?

    be bullish) or are traders more constructive (which would be bearish) to see if
    this is just a 10-15% corrective air pocket or something more serious.
