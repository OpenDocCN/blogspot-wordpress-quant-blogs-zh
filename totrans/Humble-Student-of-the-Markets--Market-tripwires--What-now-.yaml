    riding around on a motorcycle at 100mph without a helmet on. It doesn't necessarily
    mean that you get hurt. It just means that if you hit a bump in the road the damage
    will be very, very bad.

    news Friday is a typical "bump in the road". It remains to be seen what kind of
    damage it causes to market psychology and whether Goldman's failure to disclose
    the receipt of a Wells Notice is the beginning of a death spiral for the investment
    bank (or the market). My inner trader, on the other hand, tells me to stay with
    the positive momentum for now, watch for technical breaks and maintain very tight
    stops.

    the market action of the last few days have been the signs of technical breaks

    the bulls and an intermediate term correction is most likely underway. The most
    important ones for me has been the action of the Shanghai Composite, which not
    only violated an uptrend but important support levels:'

    zone would be somewhere between 1050, the 50% Fibonacci retracement level, and
    about 1100, the 200-day moving average, which is also situated slightly above
    the 38% Fibonacci retracement.

    as the SPX. This index has already violated its 50-day moving average support
    level, but it’s still above the uptrend line that began in July 2009, which should
    provide an area of technical support.

    don’t go straight up or straight down. Even the Crash of 1987 began with a top
    in August, which sparked various trendline violations, and the Crash didn’t happen
    until October, a full two months later. In the near term, the market is likely
    to stage some sort of reflex rally from current levels. At that point, we need
    to watch for signs of how the psychology develops.

  zh: 即使我已经倾向于看跌，我也认识到市场不会一直直线上升或下跌。即使是1987年的大崩溃，也是从8月份的高点开始的，引发了各种趋势线突破，而崩溃直到10月份才发生，相隔整整两个月。短期内，市场可能会从当前水平反弹。在那个时候，我们需要关注心理如何发展。
- en: Already I see a number of technicians calling for an intermediate term bottom
    at around the 1040 to 1100 level on the SPX. Given the weak action of the broader
    NYSE Composite, my best guess is that support materializes closer to 1040, which
    also coincides with the February lows. If the market does descends to those levels,
    how will market participants react should we approach those price zones?

  zh: 现在我已经看到许多技术分析师预测SPX在1040到1100水平附近将出现中期底部。鉴于纽交所综合指数的整体疲软表现，我最好的猜测是支撑位更接近1040，这也与2月份的低点相吻合。如果市场确实下跌到那些水平，市场参与者在我们接近那些价格区域时会做出怎样的反应呢？
- en: I would watch the sentiment indicators. Is there widespread panic (which would
    be bullish) or are traders more constructive (which would be bearish) to see if
    this is just a 10-15% corrective air pocket or something more serious.

  zh: 我会关注市场情绪指标。是否存在广泛的恐慌（这将利好）还是交易者更具建设性（这将利空）来判断这只是一个10-15%的修正性空气口袋还是更严重的事情。
