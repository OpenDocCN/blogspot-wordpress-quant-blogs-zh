    the blog forwarded me this link from Alex Roslin’s site: [http://cotstimer.blogspot.com/](http://cotstimer.blogspot.com/)Here
    is some bullish evidence at least making the case for Gold despite the bearish
    positions expressed in the COT report. This was forwarded to me by Alex Golubev–also
    a frequent reader and friend of the blog–a piece written by prominent economist
    David Rosenberg:'

    India — the largest in at least 30 years that took up half of what the IMF intends
    to sell. Look for China to come in next.

    FX reserves from 4%. Fifteen years ago, that representation was closer to 20%.
    China has increased its gold holdings by 76% over the past six years but they
    are a mere 1.9% of the aggregate 2.2 trillion of reserves and Russia’s gold holdings
    is just under 5%. This is not the 1990s when Bob Rubin was running a hard U.S.
    dollar policy, U.S. fiscal deficits were vanishing and gold production was on
    the rise. Today’s world is exactly the opposite. Policymakers beginning in the
    1990s wanted disinflation and got it. Now they want inflation — it will take years,
    maybe a decade, but it will come. For the near-term, we are still optimistic on
    Treasury securities but be forewarned that this view has an expiry date that is
    earlier than the peak we are likely to see in gold.

    that gold is now again being considered a currency within the global monetary
    system. As we said before, it is all about relative scarcity and a well-defined
    supply curve — fiat currency at this juncture does not share that quality. As
    a good friend reminded me yesterday, when the Fed was created nearly a century
    ago, it was acceptable to have at least 40% of the money supply backed by gold
    reserves. The U.S. now has 8,133 tons of gold in reserve, which equates to $285
    billion at this year’s pricing.

    base now stands at $1.7 trillion. Do the math — under the old regime (which indeed
    hamstrung the Fed), the U.S. alone would need to buy an incremental $400 billion
    of bullion or the equivalent of what would be nearly four times the typical level
    of annual demand. We could do the same calculation based on M2 but we don’t want
    anyone falling off their chairs.
