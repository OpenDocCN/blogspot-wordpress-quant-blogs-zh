- en: I have one full-time opening in my group, and possibly two consulting positions.
    The full-time job will be located on our Equities trading floor in the TriBeCa
    section of New York City. The consulting positions will be either in NY or in
    Jersey City.

- en: For the full-time position, I am looking for a great .NET developer. The ideal
    candidate should be familiar with Team Foundation Server and issues around build
    and deployment. The candidate should also be familiar with WPF and WCF; we would
    ideally welcome someone who is proficient with one of the two and would be willing
    to become expert in the other.

    WCF are highly desirable, as there will be definite UI work.

    remotely. They will be routed directly to /dev/null.
