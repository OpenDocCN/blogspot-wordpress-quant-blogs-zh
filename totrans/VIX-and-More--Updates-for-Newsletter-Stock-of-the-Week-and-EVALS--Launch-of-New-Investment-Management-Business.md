# VIX and More: Updates for Newsletter/Stock of the Week and EVALS; Launch of New Investment Management Business

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2013/08/updates-for-newsletterstock-of-week-and.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2013/08/updates-for-newsletterstock-of-week-and.html#0001-01-01)

Just a quick note to inform readers that I recently provided updates and some performance data for the *VIX and More* Newsletter and also for the EVALS model portfolio service:

Please note that going forward I will no longer be publicly updating performance data for EVALS or for the [Stock of the Week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/stock%20of%20the%20week) due to a variety of factors related to the launch of my new investment management business. I will continue to offer the newsletter, which will still include the Stock of the Week selection; I will also continue to offer the EVALS model portfolio service and will be pleased to discuss current performance data privately. As soon as the launch of my new investment management business is finalized, I will highlight some of the particulars in this space.

Posting on the *VIX and More* blog should not be affected by any of these changes. In fact, I pledge to resume a more regular posting schedule in the weeks and months ahead.
