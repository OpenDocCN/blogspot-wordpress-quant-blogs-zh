    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    conditions suggest that my thesis of late cycle sector leadership of capital goods
    and resource extraction industries should have some legs as the Street's stampede
    is just starting. Before rushing to hop a ride on the Reflation Express, though,
    I would caution that a couple of risks lie ahead. In the short run, the advance
    appears extended and vulnerable to a pullback. As well, the FOMC meeting next
    week could be a source of significant market volatility.
