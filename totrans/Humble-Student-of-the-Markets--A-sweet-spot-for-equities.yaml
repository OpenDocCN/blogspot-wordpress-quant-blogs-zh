    at Value Line Inc. Though he retired in 2009, after 63 years at that firm, he
    continues in retirement to update and refine a complex econometric model that
    generates six-month forecasts for the SP 500 — and he shares them with inquiring
    columnists.

    his model right now is low interest rates. Since the Federal Reserve has signaled

    could as early as next year start forecasting a less rosy six-month outlook.

    which appear to be a worrisome development. However, these readings are highly
    volatile and unreliable. As an example, I inserted vertical lines into the Bespoke
    charts indicating similar extremes in sentiment. While some of these signals were
    accurate warnings of near-term tops, in other cases the market shrugged off these
    excesses in the past to advance higher.

    ratio spike to an extreme. Such spikes have signaled market rallies in the past.
    However, previous spikes in the put-call ratio have occurred when the market had
    been falling, not rising as it had been last week. I therefore interpret last
    week's put-call ratio as an anomalous reading that could be ignored, despite its
    bullish implications. One possible explanation for the put-call ratio spike was
    that traders were seeking protection from negative Russia-Ukraine developments
    over the long Labor Day weekend - which is a one-time event.

    what other sentiment readings are showing. Rydex fund flows show a picture of
    a market that has recovered from a panic with sentiment readings normalizing,
    but have not moved to the other extreme of a crowded long.

    from panic and normalization. I interpret these conditions as a market that could
    see a minor (1-2%) pullback but the risk of a major correction as being low. The
    path of least resistance for stocks is still up.
