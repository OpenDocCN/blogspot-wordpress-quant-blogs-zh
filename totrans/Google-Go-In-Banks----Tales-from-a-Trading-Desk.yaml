- en: Investment banks have historically been quite restricted on what languages can/can‚Äôt
    be used within the software development stack ‚Äì Java/C#/Flex/JavaScript possibly
    being the main choices.¬† This has opened up a little in the last time period,
    with various banks making large jumps into the Python pond,¬† smaller jumps into
    Scala ([Scala vs Go](http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~kena/classes/5828/s12/presentation-materials/smithbrentgibsonleon.pdf)),
    and even smaller jumps into Clojure.¬† With the recent release of Go [1.1](http://blog.golang.org/2013/05/go-11-is-released.html),
    the usual spike on the web to accompany such an event, is it time to investment
    in this language?
