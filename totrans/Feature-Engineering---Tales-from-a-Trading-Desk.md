## Feature Engineering

Although not published yet, [Mastering Feature Engineering](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920049081.do) early release looks like its going to be a interesting read.

> [Feature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_engineering) [engineering](http://www.slideshare.net/AliceZheng3/the-how-and-why-of-feature-engineering) is the process of using domain knowledge of the data to create features that make machine learning algorithms work.

Machine Learning Mastery has a lengthly blog posting on the [topic](http://machinelearningmastery.com/discover-feature-engineering-how-to-engineer-features-and-how-to-get-good-at-it/), with a number of links at the end of the posting.

Its of no surprise that Mastering Feature Engineering tackles Bag-of-words, since its a useful feature engineering tool when looking at any text e.g cv’s, documentation, etc
