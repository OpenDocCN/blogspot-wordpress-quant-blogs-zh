    trade has certainly worked out well. Now that Emmanuel Macron is destined to be
    the President of France, and Angela Merkel is the front runner to win another
    term as German Chancellor, challenges lie ahead for French-German cooperation

    American foreign policy establishment headaches, namely the election of Moon Jae

    markets for future gains, as valuations are far more compelling overseas. Not
    so fast! The story is more nuanced than that. The resolution of the situations
    in Europe and Korea have profound investment implications. As well, they have
    the potential to set the world on some very different paths for the next decade.
