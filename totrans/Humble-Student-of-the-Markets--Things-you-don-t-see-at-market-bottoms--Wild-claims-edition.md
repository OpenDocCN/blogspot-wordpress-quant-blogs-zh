# Humble Student of the Markets: Things you don't see at market bottoms: Wild claims edition

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2017/07/things-you-dont-see-at-market-bottoms_20.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2017/07/things-you-dont-see-at-market-bottoms_20.html#0001-01-01)

It is said that while bottoms are events, but tops are processes. Translated, markets bottom out when panic sets in, and therefore they can be more easily identifiable. By contrast, market tops form when a series of conditions come together, but not necessarily all at the same time.

I have stated that while I don't believe that the stock market has made its final cyclical top, we are in the late stages of a bull market (see 

[Risks are rising, but THE TOP is still ahead](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2017/06/18/risks-are-rising-but-the-top-is-still-ahead/)

 and

[Nearing the terminal phase of this equity bull](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2017/07/02/nearing-the-terminal-phase-of-this-equity-bull/)

). Nevertheless, psychology is getting a little frothy, which represent the pre-condition for a major top. This is just one post in a series of "thing you don't see at market bottoms". Past editions of this series include:

It is said that one of the signs of a market top is when participants (and scam artists) start making wild claims for the future. Here are some examples:

*   USA Today: Millennials fear of stocks could cost them $3.3 million
*   Chinese offshore property stampede: Start of a trend?
*   A sucker born every minute, or more signs of unbridled greed
