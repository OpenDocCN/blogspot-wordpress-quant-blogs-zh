- en: The large gap up this morning is quite unusual on the day of a Fed meeting.
    I ran a test back to 1983 to find other times the market was significantly higher
    at 1:30pm Eastern time on the day of a Fed meeting. I was only able to find 3
    other times where the market was up at least 1.5% by 1:30\. On 8/21/84 the market
    tacked on another 0.04% in the afternoon. On 12/18/84 it added another 1.37%,
    and on 1/5/88 it lost 0.64%.
