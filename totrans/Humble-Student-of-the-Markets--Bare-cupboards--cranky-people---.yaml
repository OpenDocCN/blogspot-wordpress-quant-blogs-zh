    shown because the two components of the index, namely headline unemployment and
    CPI, are arguably understated compared to the 1970s – previous episodes of high
    misery in US history.

    up until recently. Being in the Eurozone made investors confident. Now that confidence
    is eroding daily. And this week’s market action says rates will go higher, without
    some fiscal discipline. To help my US readers put this in perspective, let’s assume
    that Greece was the size of the US. To get back to Maastricht Treaty levels, they
    would need to cut the deficit by 4% of GDP for the next few years. If the US did
    that, it would mean an equivalent budget cut of $500 billion dollars. Per year.
    For three years running.

    the Greek economy goes into recession, the amount collected in taxes will fall,
    meaning the shortfall will increase. Second, it ***is not clear that Greek voters
    will approve such a plan at their next elections. Riots and demonstrations are
