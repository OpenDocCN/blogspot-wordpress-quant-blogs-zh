    to follow suit, if history repeats itself, in the context of these global financial
    crises (Turkey is all of a sudden a big power broker, and not necessarily in a
    very stable fashion). Investors should focus their attention on the currencies
    and government bonds of countries whose public balance sheets are truly AAA rated

    systems: these would include Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden and

    of the effects of diversification disappear when you need it the most – during
    panic episodes such as we saw in the Lehman crisis, the Russia crisis, etc. The
    basic assumption in a buy-and-hold asset allocation is that correlations and volatility
    estimates are stable. What happens when return correlations converge to 1 as they
    do during panic episodes?

    As an example, consider a balanced-fund manager who uses, say, bonds to reduce
    the volatility of a fund which contains equities. Or a financial planner who assesses
    the risk tolerance of a client investor and proposes, say, a 60-40 equities-bonds
    mix. The traditional way of managing these investments is to look at the long
    term historical volatility of the component asset classes to decide the proportions
    to invest in. Usually no consideration is given to the vovo of the asset classes
    and no constant volatility target is set. So ***the investor or manager with a
    static or reasonably constant 60-40 mix has to suffer the varying volatility of
    the markets. sometimes sleeping well at night, occasionally not***. In order to
    ensure that the worst volatility is minimised the asset allocation will have erred
    on the side of conservative. This will have cost returns.

    step is to look at the problem from an analytical point of view instead of relying
    on estimates of volatility and correlation based on historical data. Why is X
    correlated or uncorrelated to Y and why? Look for causality (e.g. when interest
    rates rise, bond prices fall) instead of historical correlations.

    are emerging market equities more or less risky than developed market equities
    given the higher secular growth exhibited by emerging market economies? My answer:
