    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    in the direction of the main Trend Model signal. A bullish Trend Model signal
    that gets less bullish is a trading "sell" signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend
    Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading "buy" signal. The history of
    actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of the trading model are shown by
    the arrows in the chart below. The turnover rate of the trading model is high,
    and it has varied between 150% to 200% per month.

    evolution of the Turkish Tantrum provides investors a glimpse at what a real EM
    blow-up might look like in the future, especially if China were to undergo a debt
    crisis.

    next few weeks. Any rally therefore represents a second gift from the market gods.
    Investors can take the opportunity to lighten up their equity holdings in anticipation
    of long-term market weakness.

    with how monetary policy is affecting both Wall Street and Main Street. The latest
    Turkish inspired sell-off just provides another point of bearish pressure.

- en: In light of Friday's above consensus core CPI print, the Fed is likely to stay
    on their preset course of a quarter point rate hike every three months. Already,
    the Turkish lira crisis has sparked an upside breakout of the USD Index. If the
    breakout holds, it will spell trouble in other quarters. In addition to the pressure
    on other vulnerable EM currencies, a rising USD depresses the Chinese Yuan (CNY)
    and raise the specter of a currency war.
