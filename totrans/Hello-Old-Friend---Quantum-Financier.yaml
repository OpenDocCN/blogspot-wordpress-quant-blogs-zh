    post. It might seem like a long time for some, but coming out of college and hitting
    the ground running as a full-time trader made it seem like the blink of an eye
    for me. That being said, I have recently come to miss it and have the intention
    to start blogging again albeit on an irregular schedule that will evolve based
    on my free time.

    can only imagine that the new perspective I hope to bring to the analysis contained
    moving forward will be more insightful.

    as my main language. I have all but fully moved my research stack to Python, so
    you can expect to see a lot more of it moving forward. As for the content, I think
    the focus will remain the same for the most part; algorithmic trading for the
    Equities markets.

    kept in touch during my absence from the blogosphere. I can only hope that the
    number of people that somehow find value in these short articles will grow over
    time and that I will meet other interesting people. You are after all the reason
    I write these notes. So a big **Thank You** to all of you.
