    they only deviate from the benchmark of what everyone else is doing  when they
    feel they have an edge. There's no other reason to do so. As many people falsely
    believe they have an edge in highly risky (antifragile?) stocks, this causes these
    securities to have lower-than-average returns within bonds, stocks, options, horses,
    and lotteries.

- en: That's a good rule, often noted by Graham. It's obviously impossible, in aggregate,
    but I think it's not only descriptive, but good normative advice. If you know
    that's the game you are playing, it should create greater caution, more sober
    risk-taking. The alternative is that you can take big risks and these generate
    return premiums via their risk premium, but alas the risk premium is usually negative,
    so that theory seems falsified via conventional empiricism.
