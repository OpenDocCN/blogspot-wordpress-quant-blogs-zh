- en: The equilibrium model represents the orthodoxy of economics and financial modeling.
    Virtually all the works of mainstream economists are based on equilibrium models.
    In finance, the discounted cash flow model (DCF) is a good example of an equilibrium
    model.
  prefs: []

    model is one variation. The PB-ROE model is another.

- en: Investors use elements of the DCF model to approximate value. The P/E ratio,
    or E/P ratio, is really nothing more than shorthand for a single term of the DCF
    model. Other variations, based on going up the income statement, use EBITDA to
    EV, Sales to Price or Sales to EV. Value investors have used these measures for
    years.

    point is the curiosity of the relationship between U.S. stock and long bond yields.
    U.S. stock dividend yields traded above long bond yields until the 1950s, when
    the relationship inverted. Recently, they inverted again, when dividend yields
    rose above those of the long bond.

    managing and founding principal at AQR Capital Management, a Greenwich, CT-based
    quantitative research firm. In the March/April 2000 issue of Financial Analysts
    Journal, Asness argued that neither the pre-1958 period nor the decades since
    are anomalous. On the contrary, he found that -- below the surface -- stock and
    bond yields have always been strongly positively correlated.

    that ***investors' expectations have changed of the relative volatility of stocks
    and bonds*.** Prior to the last 50 years, investors expected the stock market's
    volatility to be much greater than bond market volatility. To entice investors
    to incur that greater volatility, the stock market had to provide a higher yield
    than bonds.

    assume that we are all rational human beings who make rational decisions based
    on expected returns and, even if every person isn’t the same, risk aversion functions
    are relatively well-behaved.

    can shift in very a dramatic fashion. Quantitative models that depend on the past

    behavior for years. Technical analysts use trend following techniques to jump
    on the investor bandwagon and a variety of overbought/oversold models to try to
    jump off the bandwagon. They use techniques such as advance-decline lines to better
    measure the underlying trend. Divergences are thought of as significant, as the
    indicator, such as the A-D line, is a better model of the “true” trend.

    that growth stocks, as defined by high P/E or high P/B, lag the market over the
    long term. Growth investors use momentum techniques to chase the next Xerox, the
    next Microsoft, the next Google, etc., based on the high psychological payoff
    of finding the big ten or twenty-bagger.

    to work, owing to their extreme sensitivity to initial conditions. Some researchers
    have successfully measured the degree of non-linearity in the market and thus
    been able to better forecast risk. My own limited observation of non-linear models
    is that if they do work, their forecasts aren’t all that better than linear models.
