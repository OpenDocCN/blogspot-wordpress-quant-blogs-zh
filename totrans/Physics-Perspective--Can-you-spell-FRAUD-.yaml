- en: in the New York Review of Books by US District Court Judge Jed Rakoff, asking
    pointed questions about why no executives of major financial institutions have
    been convicted of fraud for their actions in the lead up to the financial crisis.
    As he argues, the Commission set up to explore the crisis found plenty of evidence
    of widespread fraud; the Justice Department has simply failed to act. Why?

- en: '...the stated opinion of those government entities asked to examine the financial
    crisis overall is not that no fraud was committed. Quite the contrary. For example,
    the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, in its final report, uses variants of
    the word “fraud” no fewer than 157 times in describing what led to the crisis,
    concluding that there was a “systemic breakdown,” not just in accountability,
    but also in ethical behavior.'

    the number of reports of suspected mortgage fraud rising twenty-fold between 1996
    and 2005 and then doubling again in the next four years. As early as 2004, <acronym>FBI</acronym>
    Assistant Director Chris Swecker was publicly warning of the “pervasive problem”
    of mortgage fraud, driven by the voracious demand for mortgage-backed securities.
    Similar warnings, many from within the financial community, were disregarded,
    not because they were viewed as inaccurate, but because, as one high-level banker
    put it, “A decision was made that ‘We’re going to have to hold our nose and start
    buying the stated product if we want to stay in business.’”

    financial crisis, the prevailing view of many government officials (as well as
    others) was that the crisis was in material respects the product of intentional
    fraud. In a nutshell, the fraud, they argued, was a simple one. Subprime mortgages,
    i.e., mortgages of dubious creditworthiness, increasingly provided the chief collateral
    for highly leveraged securities that were marketed as <acronym>AAA</acronym>,
    i.e., securities of very low risk. How could this transformation of a sow’s ear
    into a silk purse be accomplished unless someone dissembled along the way?

    describing the roots of the financial crisis than have the various commissions
    of inquiry and other government agencies, I have seen nothing to indicate their
    disagreement with the widespread conclusion that fraud at every level permeated
    the bubble in mortgage-backed securities. Rather, their position has been to excuse
    their failure to prosecute high-level individuals for fraud in connection with
    the financial crisis on one or more of three grounds:'

    So, then, why no prosecutions? He discounts the revolving door theory -- the prosecutors
    have avoided action because of former links to financial firms, or hope of future
    employment links -- because, in his experience, prosecutors are well motivated
    to get convictions. He suggests that there are a host of reasons: prosecutors
    simply had other priorities in the years after 9/11/2001; in many cases government
    regulators acquiesced early on to changing practices, where in increasingly lax
    demands on mortgage documentation became the norm. And, finally and most importantly,
    he points to changes in prosecuting practices over the past few decades:'

    of the three, and arguably the most important. It is the shift that has occurred,
    over the past thirty years or more, from focusing on prosecuting high-level individuals
    to focusing on prosecuting companies and other institutions. It is true that prosecutors
    have brought criminal charges against companies for well over a hundred years,
    but until relatively recently, such prosecutions were the exception, and prosecutions
    of companies without simultaneous prosecutions of their managerial agents were
    even rarer.

    do. And while a company might get the benefit of some such crimes, prosecuting
    the company would inevitably punish, directly or indirectly, the many employees
    and shareholders who were totally innocent. Moreover, under the law of most US
    jurisdictions, a company cannot be criminally liable unless at least one managerial
    agent has committed the crime in question; so why not prosecute the agent who
    actually committed the crime?

    prosecuting companies, often even without indicting a single person. This shift
    has often been rationalized as part of an attempt to transform “corporate cultures,”
    so as to prevent future such crimes; and as a result, government policy has taken
    the form of “deferred prosecution agreements” or even “nonprosecution agreements,”
    in which the company, under threat of criminal prosecution, agrees to take various
    prophylactic measures to prevent future wrongdoing. Such agreements have become,
    in the words of Lanny Breuer, the former head of the Department of Justice’s Criminal
    Division, “a mainstay of white-collar criminal law enforcement,” with the department
    entering into 233 such agreements over the last decade. But in practice, I suggest,
    this approach has led to some lax and dubious behavior on the part of prosecutors,
    with deleterious results.

    for an apparent financial fraud, you go about your business in much the same way
    you go after mobsters or drug kingpins: you start at the bottom and, over many
    months or years, slowly work your way up. Specifically, you start by “flipping”
    some lower- or mid-level participant in the fraud who you can show was directly
    responsible for making one or more false material misrepresentations but who is
    willing to cooperate, and maybe even “wear a wire”—i.e., secretly record his colleagues—in
    order to reduce his sentence. With his help, and aided by the substantial prison
    penalties now available in white-collar cases, you go up the ladder.'

    place. Early in the investigation, you invite in counsel to the company and explain
    to him or her why you suspect fraud. He or she responds by assuring you that the
    company wants to cooperate and do the right thing, and to that end the company
    has hired a former assistant US attorney, now a partner at a respected law firm,
    to do an internal investigation. The company’s counsel asks you to defer your
    investigation until the company’s own internal investigation is completed, on
    the condition that the company will share its results with you. In order to save
    time and resources, you agree.

    that mistakes were made but that the company is now intent on correcting them.
    You and the company then agree that the company will enter into a deferred prosecution
    agreement that couples some immediate fines with the imposition of expensive but
    internal prophylactic measures. For all practical purposes the case is now over.
    You are happy because you believe that you have helped prevent future crimes;
    the company is happy because it has avoided a devastating indictment; and perhaps
    the happiest of all are the executives, or former executives, who actually committed
    the underlying misconduct, for they are left untouched.

    justified because it prevents future crimes, I suggest that the future deterrent
    value of successfully prosecuting individuals far outweighs the prophylactic benefits
    of imposing internal compliance measures that are often little more than window-dressing.
    Just going after the company is also both technically and morally suspect. It
    is technically suspect because, under the law, you should not indict or threaten
    to indict a company unless you can prove beyond a reasonable doubt that some managerial
    agent of the company committed the alleged crime; and if you can prove that, why
    not indict the manager? And from a moral standpoint, punishing a company and its
    many innocent employees and shareholders for the crimes committed by some unprosecuted
    individuals seems contrary to elementary notions of moral responsibility.

    growing out of the financial crisis, because, as noted, the Department of Justice’s
    position, until at least recently, is that going after the suspect institutions
    poses too great a risk to the nation’s economic recovery. So you don’t go after
    the companies, at least not criminally, because they are too big to jail; and
    you don’t go after the individuals, because that would involve the kind of years-long
    investigations that you no longer have the experience or the resources to pursue.

    crisis that is still causing so many of us so much pain and despondency was the
    product, in whole or in part, of fraudulent misconduct. But if it was—as various
    governmental authorities have asserted it was—then the failure of the government
    to bring to justice those responsible for such colossal fraud bespeaks weaknesses
    in our prosecutorial system that need to be addressed.
