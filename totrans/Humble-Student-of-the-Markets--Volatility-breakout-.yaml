    is contrarian bullish for equities. The chart below shows the 5 day exponential
    moving average of the equity only put-call ratio (in blue) and the 21 day moving
    average (in red). Both are at elevated levels relative to their own recent history.

    message. The top panel of the chart below shows the VIX term structure measured
    as a ratio of VIX to VXV, or three-month expected volatility. When the ratio is
    above 1, it means that the term structure is downward sloping, the option market
    is showing a high level of fear. By contrast, if the ratio is low, indicating
    that the term structure is steeply upward sloping, it is an indication of complacency.

    is this so-called "fear index" so low?

    equity put-call ratio may be a precursor to a higher volatility environment:'

    that case, an elevated put-call ratio relative to its own recent history could
    be a signal of rising volatility, rather than just rising fear.

    they remain low on an absolute basis, which would normally be interpreted as bullish.
