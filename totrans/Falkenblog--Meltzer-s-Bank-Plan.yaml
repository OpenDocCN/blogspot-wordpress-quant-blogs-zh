- en: Timmy Geithner's stress test looks at the effects of macro economic changes
    on bank balance sheets, an exercise surely to not generate effects larger than
    their standard errors. This will be manifest in the absence of standard errors
    in what they produce, and any scientific forecast includes standard errors.

- en: 'But one might say, just stress the market by 3 standard deviations. Yet, if
    the market falls another 50%, one must anticipate a total collapse of the financial
    markets, so I think yes, if we can''t figure out how to keep financial markets
    from going into a tailspin, it''s "start over" for the American financial system.
    I don''t think that''s going to happen, I''m just saying in a scenario where banks
    on average are writing down their risky (ie, non-Treasury) assets by 20%, implies
    imagining everyone is insolvent because there is an accelerator mechanism at play
    here. Thus, I don''t think such an exercise would shed much light on the puzzle
    of whom to shut down. With that scenario, the answer is trivial: everyone. Then
    the question is, how is the government going to replace our current financial
    system, as they will no doubt feel obligated to do?'

- en: the Fed merely say they will match fund equity investors in banks. Say a bank
    wants $20B, if it can raise $10B, the government will add $10\. If banks think
    they are solvent, then bank equities owners will prefer dilution to being stopped
    out due to liquidity concerns. If a bank is insolvent, it will find no equity
    investors, and so then be taken over in the way the S&L's were disposed of in
    the early 1990's. This has the advantage of using the market to determine who
    is solvent, not some arbitrary stress test.

- en: If I were Treasury Secretary, I would do nothing. Luckily, Geithner has such
    low gravitas that's all he can get away with, going through the motions, generate
    reports, testify in front of Congress 3 times a week, that in the end does not
    amount to much. Thus, I am pleasantly pleased with Geitner because if he had more
    credibility he might actually be able to do something; given the predilections
    of the Obama team it would be worse than doing nothing.
