## Ethereum Devcon – Smart Contracts and Opportunity

This week I’d have liked to have been in two places at once.  I’m in Seattle for the Construx Software Executive [Summit](http://www.construx.com/Thought_Leadership/Events/Software_Executive_Summit/?id=16269), but would also have liked to have been in London for the Ethereum Developer [Conference](https://devcon.ethereum.org/), unfortunately the clone machine isn’t working 😦  There are however numerous articles on the web already from Ethereum Devcon, which should allow anyone who missed the conference to “catchup”:

*   [First](http://cointelegraph.com/news/115611/ethereum-devcon1-expert-view-of-the-first-day) Day
    *   Of no surprise, scaling was one topic from day 1, with discussion around “hub and spoke” model, verification layers and asynchronous programming
    *   Metamask demo available [here](https://metamask.io/).
    *   Nice to see [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) written in go.
*   [Second](http://cointelegraph.com/news/115636/ethereum-devcon1-expert-view-of-the-second-day) Day
*   [Third](http://cointelegraph.com/news/115636/ethereum-devcon1-expert-view-of-the-third-day) Day
*   [Fourth](http://cointelegraph.com/news/115653/ethereum-devcon1-expert-view-of-the-fourth-day) Day
    *   UBS Smart [Bond](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmsOP1D8zNs) (1:56:00) – smart contract, Bond Coin, benchmark contract
*   [Fifth](http://cointelegraph.com/news/115653/ethereum-devcon1-expert-view-of-the-fifth-day) Day
    *   Bank Panel [discussion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34RfEodTn_w) blockchain – UBS, Barclays, SocGen
    *   Top priority areas for [banking](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/barclays-wants-help-blockchain-startups-understand-investment-banking-requirements-1520560) blockchain [innovation](http://www.dugcampbell.com/london-blockchain-conference-2015/):
        *   Mandatory Regulatory use cases via shared ledger
            *   KYC – shared “know your customrr” control process
        *   Operational [Efficiency](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/barclays-wants-help-blockchain-startups-understand-investment-banking-requirements-1520560)/Cost Reduction (Ops and Tech)
            *   Asset registry
            *   Settlement (UBS interested in this area in particular)
            *   Netting Pool – complicated problem to get settlement efficiency due to the current solutions of stopping time to optimise
        *   Business Growth from an investment bank perspective
    *   Still challenges that need work in the Smart Contract area – expect The Alan Turing [Institute](https://turing.ac.uk/) to aid here
