- en: I’ve been waiting for a blog entry to appear for Mike Cohn’s recent monthly
    news article, “Paying the Cost for More Precise Estimates”.  Unfortunately, apart
    from the campaign [URL](http://us4.campaign-archive1.com/?u=69aab24b249d49f4eade10a9c&id=f9db3e601a),
    nothing has appears on Mike’s blog as far as I can see. So without waiting any
    long, let me offer the summary view of an excellent article – estimation is not
    free!  I realise this maybe obvious to some, but few manager understand the “cost”
    associated with estimation.

    to provide an estimate at whatever level of detail and precision the boss wants.
    The problem is when the boss wants a highly precise estimate and isn’t willing
    to pay the cost, for example, “I need to know by lunch time today exactly when
    this large project can be delivered.”

    to pay that cost, you need to be willing to provide the information.
