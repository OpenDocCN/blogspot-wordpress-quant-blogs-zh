    to mean-reverting strategies. I explained my reasoning better in my book than
    in the interview, and so I will paraphrase the explanation here.

- en: In algorithmic trading, it is reasonable and intuitive that we should always
    make use of the latest information in determining whether we should enter into
    a position, whether that information is price, news, or some analysis. Let's call
    this the Principle of Latest Information. (If someone can think of a better or
    sexier name, let me know!)

- en: So let's say we have a stock model based on price momentum, and we entered into
    a long position based on a recent positive return on price. A few minutes later,
    the price went down instead of up, causing a big loss on our position. If we now
    ran this momentum model again, very likely it would tell us to short the stock
    instead because of the recent negative return on price. If we did that, we would
    be exiting the previously long position and became flat. This is in effect a stop
    loss, and it follows strictly from adhering to our model and our Principle of
    Latest Information.

    we entered into a long position based on a recent drop in price. A few minutes
    later, the price went down further instead of up, again causing a big loss on
    our position. If we now ran this mean-reversion model again, it would definitely
    tell us to buy the stock again because of the ever cheaper price. The model would
    not ask you to exit this position and take a loss. Hence, adhering to the model
    and the Principle of Latest Information will not lead to a stop loss for a mean-reverting
    model.

    new historical prices into determining its long or short signals as it retrain
    itself, as the Principle of Latest Information says it should! At that time, it
    may indeed recommend that we exit the previously held long position at a loss.
    But this adjustment takes place at a much longer time scale, and therefore cannot
    really be considered a stop-loss in its usual sense.)

- en: More generally, I find that at every turn, and not only in the realm of stock
    trading, applying the Principle of Latest Information always help me to be disciplined
    and not be afraid to enter into new positions, take loss or endure a drawdown
    as the case may be.
