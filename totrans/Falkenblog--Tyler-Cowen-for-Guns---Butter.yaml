    a lot of interesting news. But he is also an incredibly nonjudgmental reviewer,
    who seems to have hundreds of favorite labor economists, Peruvian painters, Italian
    novelists, and always sees papers as being at least half full of insight. He's
    the Paula Abdul of economists, which is fine once you know how to notch down his
    reviews.

    agricultural policies (paying to not grow), and the cartelization of industry.
    This last item, however, is really a loaded term because it could refer to the
    whole panoply of New Deal intrusions: the Tennessee Valley Authority that nationalized
    a lot of utilities in the Southeast, the National Recovery Administration (NRA)
    that tried to set minimum wages and other Labor wants, the nationalized unemployment
    relief through the Works Progress Administration (WPA), the Wagner act that strengthened
    the Unions in collective bargaining. He could be talking about merely to one of
    the more absurd policies within this list, but who knows.'

    policies, some good and some bad ... The good New Deal policies, like constructing
    a basic social safety net, made sense on their own terms

    I presume he would have said social security, so what is in that list? I guess
    it's take your pick from those policies that were intended to be a safety net
    within the NRA, WPA that contributed to the cartelization of industry. Pro-New
    Dealers consider everything part of the 'safety net', whereas anti-New Dealers
    point to the cartel characteristics, same policies, different emphasis or spin.
    So, he needs to be more specific, because otherwise this is like saying he is
    for the 'pro growth/happiness' policies and against the 'mean/decline' policies,
    which are the same policies seen through a different lens

    the man who sees the truth of each side of an argument sees nothing. Surely, every
    side has its correct arguments, its principled arguments, but one should step
    back, and say, net net, that the New Deal was good or bad, not that it was a mixed
    bag, leaving the good and bad as an ill-defined overlapping set of programs.
