    crapshoot, given geopolitical turbulence, [currency risk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency_risk),
    and country-sector concentration. Towards eliminating discretionary prediction,
    this post applies [minimum variance rotation](https://quantivity.wordpress.com/2011/04/20/minimum-variance-sector-rotation)
    to prominent equity markets within [EAFE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSCI_EAFE).
    The results are quite interesting in comparison with the previous [1999 – 2010
    analysis of US sectors](https://quantivity.wordpress.com/2011/04/22/minimum-variance-sector-rotation-part-2/).

    While many additional international ETFs exist today, their inception dates are
    too recent to accommodate a longitudinal panel of sufficient length. Global rotation
    will be benchmarked against [EAFE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSCI_EAFE) (via

    (including solid 20% over benchmark going into the trough); while the wheels come
    off in mid-2009\. Looking at 2009 returns for Japan and the 2009 MVP weights,
    EWJ may be to blame. Given EWJ has been mean-reverting around 10 since April 2009,
    this begs a variance penalization question: *is using the covariance matrix unfairly
    penalizing “good” (upside) variance, at the expense of “bad” (downside) variance*?
    This question is perhaps worth further analysis (see [A Brief History of Downside
    Risk Measures](http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.22.262),
