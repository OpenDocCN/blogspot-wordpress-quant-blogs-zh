- en: '**DVixl**– an excel platform with real-time, charting, propietary indicators
    and tools, limited back-testing,  and alerts.  DVixl makes trading easier *for
    technophobes  that are not proficient in coding (like me!) and want to make life
    simpler for identifying trading opportunities*. Unlike most other platforms like
    Amibroker and Tradestation, DVixl is  no-frills, no-hassle and no-nonsense. If
    you just want to use basic trading indicators, a small suite of proprietary DV
    Indicators, and also have  an ***expert advisor tool that is highly robust and
    helps identify intermediate term trading opportunities so you don’t have to watch
    the screen every day–this is for you!***'
