# Humble Student of the Markets: Is Barrick responsible for gold at $1,000?

Bespoke recently asked the question:

[Did Barrick jinx gold again](http://bespokeinvest.typepad.com/bespoke/2009/09/did-barrick-just-jinx-gold-again.html)

?

Now we have the answer and it doesn't look pretty. Barrick's de-hedging program may have actually

***driven up the gold price***

with its buying, according to this

[report](http://english.capital.gr/News.asp?id=810030)

[emphasis mine]:

> Dehedging by the world's largest gold producer, Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX), has been the driving force behind gold's move above $1,000 a troy ounce this week, a price level analysts say is unsustainable.
> 
> ***Barrick said late Tuesday that it will close its gold hedges at a total cost of $1.9 billion over the next 12-months...***
> 
> "***We have more buying to do***," the Barrick spokesman said.

India's gold market, which is one of the largest sources of physical gold demand, is

[showing signs of lukewarm demand](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2009/07/naked-girls-and-gold-demand.html)

. What's more, I posted a few days ago that the

[US bond market could be poised for a rally](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2009/09/us-bond-market-poised-to-rally.html)

. Could this rally in gold be the final capitulation of the bond bears (and conversely the gold bulls)?

I remain a long-term commodity bull, but nothing goes straight up. For the gold bugs who want to send me hate mail, I refer you to
