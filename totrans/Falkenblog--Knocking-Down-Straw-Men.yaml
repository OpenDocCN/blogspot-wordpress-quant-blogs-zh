    that things are either 100% genes, or 100% environment, it is more complicated
    than that. This is a really silly argument, because no one arguing in favor of
    sociobiology thinks genes are 100% or deterministic, rather, they think it''s
    like arguing it is better to be tall to play basketball, a multivariate explation
    with standard errors and several factors.'

- en: But anyway, this is David Berreby's big insight, and fellow science writer John
    Horgan nods approvingly in the discussion. Berreby is a best seller, so obviously
    this kind of thing sells, but I think it is pretty pathetic that popular authors
    so often set up straw men, that is, arguments that are extreme that no one holds,
    and then knock them down as if this takes intellectual courage. I find it kind
    of bizarre, like someone saying that 'not all women are shorter than all men!',
    therefore, men and women are generally the same because to assert otherwise is
    to apply a discrete stereotype to them. Or that 'free markets don't work' because
    markets sometimes deliver suboptimal outcomes. Uh huh.
