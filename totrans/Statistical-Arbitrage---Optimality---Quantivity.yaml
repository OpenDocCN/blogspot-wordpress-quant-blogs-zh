    brief review of two recent articles: [Statistical Arbitrage in the U.S. Equities
    Market](http://www.math.nyu.edu/faculty/avellane/AvellanedaLeeStatArb071108.pdf)

- en: 'Avellaneda and Lee survey the results of statarb over 1997 – 2007, focusing
    on both classic approaches: co-integration (beta-neutralized sector ETFs) and
    [PCA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis) (factors and
    market-neutralized eigenportfolios). One of the better concise summaries of statarb
    methodology, outside the few early Ph.D. thesis published on the topic (*e.g.*
    Burgess). Section 6 is interesting, as it draws an equivalence between volume-weighting
    returns (originally popularized by technical analysis) and measuring returns in
    “trading time” (recently popularized by Dacorogna *et al.*); using such adjustment
    increases Sharpe by 37% sharpe (1.51 from 1.1, admittedly neither stellar). Given
    the broad applicability of both volume-weighting and “trading time” across diverse
    quantitative strategies, this article is worth review.'

- en: Bertram presents closed-form solutions for “optimal statistical arbitrage strategies
    with transaction costs”, derived from Taylor series approximation of real-valued
    integral. One interesting result, from § 3.1 is the assertion that *optimal entry
    and exit bands are symmetric around zero* (which differs from historical practice,
    in which such expectations were both *ad hoc* and tended to be asymmetric). Other
    interesting results are closed-form solutions for mean and variance of trade length
    and strategy return.

    processes, from his 2005 dissertation: [Modelling Asset Dynamics via an Empirical
    Investigation of Austrialian Stock Exchange Data](http://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/handle/2123/1593).
    Both are worth reading, albeit both being a bit formal.'
