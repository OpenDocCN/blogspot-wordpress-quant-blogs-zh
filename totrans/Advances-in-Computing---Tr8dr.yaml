- en: Have been watching advances in computing power for some time, since university
    really.   I did research in parallel algorithms and architecture for my first
    position at the university and later applied practically on Wall Street.   In
    those days super-expensive machines like the Intel Hypercube, Paragon, and many
    other architectures were the backbone of the HPC community.

- en: In the machine learning and optimisation world there are massive problems, some
    of which are not computable on von-neumann architectures, as their runtime would
    be astronomical.    An (absurd) example of such a problem would be to simulate
    a large number monkeys typing on typewriters, stopping when one produces the works
    of Shakespeare.   The number of monkeys required to produce such a work on average
    in astronomical.     This seems like an absurd problem, but is comparable to the
    GP / GA approach.

    polynomial order complexity.

    problem is the (often) great expense to develop one’s models in a SIMD framework,
    so can be applied to for the GPU architecture.    Although there is now standardization
    on the low-level C-variant used to program GPUs, there are significant differences
    between different models of GPUs, that even if you manage to write a correct SIMD
    program, may have to rearrange for a specific GPU implementation.   (I guess this
    is not all that different from my experiences with big-iron parallel architectures
    of the past).

    for the new GPUs that are out periodically.   Very time consuming!

    based models, each of which have obvious fine-grained parallel operations.

    use of [quantum computing](http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2009/12/machine-learning-with-quantum.html)
    to solve pattern recognition problems.   I have not done the leg-work to fully
    understand the algorithms in quantum computing, but broadly it seems to be a matter
    of framing one’s problems statistically as path integration problems (i.e., expectations),
    where quantum computing allows the paths to be explored simultaneously.'
