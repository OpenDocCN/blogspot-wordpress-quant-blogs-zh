- en: One of the inherent challenges in designing strategies is the need to specify
    certain parameters. Volatility parameters tend to work fairly well regardless
    of lookback, but there are inherent trade-offs to using short-term versus longer-term
    volatility. The former is more responsive to current market conditions while the
    latter is more stable. One approach is to use a range of lookbacks which reduces
    the variance of the estimator or strategy-  i.e. you have less risk of being wrong.
    The flip side is that you have not increased accuracy or reduced bias. Ultimately
    you don’t want to underfit relevant features as much as you do not want to overfit
    random noise in the data. Forecasting volatility can be beneficial towards achieving
    a solution but is more complicated to implement and exchanges lookback parameters
    for a new set of parameters. Using market-based measures such as the options market
    has the fewest parameters and inherent assumptions, and can theoretically improve
    accuracy but the data is not easily accessible, and it is more useful for individual
    equities rather than macro markets.

    varies its lookback as a function of market conditions. Using an exponential moving
    average framework we can apply a transition function that uses some variable that
    can help us decide what conditions should require shorter or longer lookbacks.
    More specifically, we vary the smoothing constant or alpha of the EMA using a
    mathematical transform of a chosen predictor variable.  The benefit of this approach
    is that it can potentially improve outcomes by switching to short or longer volatility
    as a function of market conditions, and it can be superior to picking a single
    parameter or basket of multiple parameters. Furthermore, it can achieve a better
    trade-off between responsiveness and smoothness which can lead to better outcomes
    when transaction costs become an issue.

- en: We can’t predict what regime we are in necessarily so the simplest way to address
    these issues is to look at whether the market is trending or mean-reverting. The
    simplest method is to use the R-squared of the underlying price of a chosen market
    with respect to time. A high r-squared indicates a strong linear fit, or high
    degree of trend while the opposite indicates a rangebound or sideways market.
    If the market is trending (r-squared is higher), then we want to shorten our lookbacks
    in order to ensure we can capture any sudden or abrupt changes in volatility.
    If the market is trendless or mean-reverting (r-squared is low) then we want to
    lengthen our lookbacks since we would also expect that volatility should revert
    to its historical long-term mean.

    alpha for an exponential moving average we need a mathematical transform. Since
    markets are lognormally distributed an exponential function makes the most sense.

- en: To get a more stable measure of R-squared we use a lookback of 20-days, but
    values between 15 to 60 days are all reasonable (shorter is noisier, longer has
    greater lag). By choosing -10 in the above formula, this will default to an almost
    anchored or all-time lookback for historical volatility for the underlying, which
    we expect to serve as an indication of “fair value” during periods in which volatility
    is mean-reverting. (Technically speaking if the r-squared is  zero then  substituting
    (2-SC)/SC gives an effective lookback of 44052.) By choosing a MAX SC of .5 we
    are limiting the smoothing period to a minimum lookback of effectively 3 days
    (2/(n+1)=SC). Therefore the adaptive volatility metric can vary its effective
    lookback window between 3 days and all history.

    than 20-days we can see that it has comparable responsiveness during periods of
    trending volatility, and has flat or unchanging volatility during periods of mean-reverting
    volatility. This leads to an ideal combination of greater accuracy and lower turnover.

- en: The results show that adaptive volatility outperforms realized volatility, and
    while not shown this is true across all realized lookback windows. Relative to
    20-day realized, adaptive volatility outperforms by 3% annually with the same
    standard deviation. Factoring in transaction costs would increase this gap in
    returns significantly.  Risk-adjusted returns are higher, but more impressively
    this comes with lower drawdowns even at the same level of volatility. This is
    due to the better combination of responsiveness and smoothness.  In either case, 
    I believe that adaptive volatility is an area worth considering as an alternative
    tool to research. One can come up with a variety of different predictors and transition
    formulas to research that may be superior– the purpose of using r-squared was
    that it happens to be straightforward and intuitive along with the exponential
    transition function.

  zh: 结果显示，自适应波动性优于实现波动性，尽管没有显示出来，但这在所有实现回看窗口中都是正确的。相对于20天的实现波动性，自适应波动性在年度表现上优于3%，而标准偏差相同。考虑交易成本后，这种收益差距会显著增加。风险调整后的收益更高，但更令人印象深刻的是，即使在相同的波动率水平下，这也伴随着更低的回撤。这是由于响应性和平滑性的更好组合。无论哪种情况，我相信自适应波动性是值得考虑的一个替代工具。人们可以提出各种不同的预测因子和转换公式进行研究，这可能更优越——使用R平方的目的是它恰好是简单直观的，加上指数转换函数。
