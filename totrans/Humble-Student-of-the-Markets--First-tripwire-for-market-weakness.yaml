    weakness. First, China has been a bright spot of global growth and a slowing or
    worse, a Chinese hard-landing, would be highly negative for the world's economy.

    I would also add a fourth, namely that the Chinese have sufficient financial reserves
    to mitigate the effects of a hard landing (for this cycle). Nevertheless, I would
    welcome signs of panic from analysts such as [Mish](http://globaleconomicanalysis.blogspot.com/2010/12/china-hikes-rates-ponders-capital.html),

- en: I have written extensively about the macro risks to the global economy in this
    blog, but the problems of China, Europe and America are 2H 2011 stories, rather
    than immediate threats to the market. For the time being, I am still inclined
    that the intermediate term is up and any problems are more likely to manifest
    themselves as we move into the summer and fall.

  zh: 我在這個博客中廣泛地寫了關於全球經濟面臨的宏觀風險，但中國、歐洲和美國的問題屬於2011年下半年的事情，而不是市場即時的威脅。目前來看，我仍然傾向於認為中短期內市場將上揚，任何問題更有可能在我們進入夏季和秋季時表現出來。
