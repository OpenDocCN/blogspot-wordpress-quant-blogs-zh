    weakness. First, China has been a bright spot of global growth and a slowing or
    worse, a Chinese hard-landing, would be highly negative for the world's economy.

    this were the start of a market correction, my base case calls for a minor pullback

    I would also add a fourth, namely that the Chinese have sufficient financial reserves
    to mitigate the effects of a hard landing (for this cycle). Nevertheless, I would
    welcome signs of panic from analysts such as [Mish](http://globaleconomicanalysis.blogspot.com/2010/12/china-hikes-rates-ponders-capital.html),

    the technical deterioration of the financials. The chart below shows the relative

    an extensive relative downturn, have actually begun to improve and outperform
    the market. This canary in the financial mine seems to be chirping quite happily.'

    blog, but the problems of China, Europe and America are 2H 2011 stories, rather
    than immediate threats to the market. For the time being, I am still inclined
    that the intermediate term is up and any problems are more likely to manifest
    themselves as we move into the summer and fall.
