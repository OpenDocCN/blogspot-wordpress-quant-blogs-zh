- en: The NFL combine is rather interesting, because predicting outcomes based on
    Moneyball-type inputs is very alluring. For everyone excited by some new statistic,
    there's another person who notes these don't capture what's most important.  The
    answer, as usual, is to use both metrics and subjective expert analysis.

- en: utt, the bigger the better.  Looking at little wrestlers I coach, a protuberant
    posterior is the best indicator of natural strength for these pre-pubescent kids. 
    Your gluteus maximus is your largest muscle, so I guess if you are going to focus
    on one muscle, better to look at that than biceps or triceps.

    interesting modeling issue. He scored as pretty much the worst QB at the NFL combine:
    5.3 second 40 yard dash, 24.5 inch vertical leap. If speed is one of your inputs,
    and your algorithm was a sequence of sorts, you would probably have eliminated
    Brady as a candidate because he was in the 1st percentile of speed and jumping
    ability. If your algorithm was more like a linear weighting, he could have compensated
    in other dimensions.'

    though on large portfolios I find these rarely make a large difference. Yet, knowing
    that I could miss the equivalent of a Tom Brady in my sequence of sorts, made
    me rethink this a bit.  Then someone noted that while speed is important in general,
    a well-specified Quarterback model would give it sufficiently low weight as to
    not have it in the filter (eg, Joe Montana had poor speed).  That comforted me
    a bit.

    a single stock, and for that, perhaps the sequence of filters is not optimal.
