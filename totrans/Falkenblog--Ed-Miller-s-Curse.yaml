    such a case, an asset with a greater dispersion of opinion would have higher prices,
    given the same average expected return. Looking below at the graph from that article,
    you see that the steep line shows the distribution of valuation when there is
    a great divergence of opinion. In such a a case, when you need finite amount $X
    to buy your stock, the more deluded the buyers are the better.

    were most likely to have overestimated its value. The petroleum engineers noted
    that oil companies suffered unexpectedly low returns in early Outer Continental
    Shelf (OCS) oil lease auctions. OCS auctions were common value auctions, where
    value of the oil in the ground is essentially the same to all bidders. Each bidder
    has their own estimate of the (unknown) value at the time that they bid. Even
    if these estimates are unbiased, bidders must account for the informational content
    inherent in winning the auction: the winner’s estimate of value is (one of) the
    highest estimates. If bidders ignore this adverse selection effect inherent in
    winning the auction, it will result in below normal or even negative profits.'

    their bid so that conditional upon winning, their private estimate does not overpay
    for the asset in question. This is actually very difficult to do in practice,
    but not that, if you win an auction with 3 people, that's a lot less scary than
    winning an auction with 300\. The relevance of the winner's curse to asset markets
    was 'partial equilibrium' analysis, supposedly irrelevant because of arbitrage.

    reference tho 1977 article as why there are low returns for highly volatile assets,
    like IPOs.
