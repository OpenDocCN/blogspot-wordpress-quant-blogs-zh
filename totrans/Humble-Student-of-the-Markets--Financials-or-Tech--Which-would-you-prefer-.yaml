    the S&P 500\. Given the well-publicized subprime problems, the sector is not surprisingly
    oversold.

    mutual funds. These 22 funds can be thought of as a composite of the S&P 500-like
    mandate funds from the largest mutual fund complexes. As you can see from the
    chart, mutual funds have been overweight the sector and appear to be increasing
    their weight.

    Index vs. the S&P 500\. The Tech sector rebounded in the Summer of 2006 and has
    been in a relative uptrend since the the Summer of 2007\. The sector has pulled
    back but the relative uptrend remains intact.

    mutual fund is roughly market weight the sector. From a sentiment analysis viewpoint,
    this gives the Tech sector room to resume its leadership trend that it began a
    few months ago.
