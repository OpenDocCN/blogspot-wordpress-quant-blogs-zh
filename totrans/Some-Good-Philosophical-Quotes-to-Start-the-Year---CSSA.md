Note: ***Never underestimate the power of the mind or a good concept. Work hard doing something you love doing and try to master it. Don’t be overly optimistic or pessimistic—be positive and realistic.  DV***

“It is sad but true that people who subconsciously tell themselves that they are unlucky, unsuccessful, unattractive, etc. actually make those things realities for themselves. On the other hand, people who think they are fortunate, cherished, beautiful, etc. also make these things happen. In sum, your mind can be your worst enemy or your most powerful ally. This will come of no surprise to those of us who trade for a living, but worth pointing out nevertheless.”

**Charles D. Kirk**, Create a Vision for Your Life [http://www.thekirkreport.com/2010/01/create-a-vision-for-your-life.html](http://www.thekirkreport.com/2010/01/create-a-vision-for-your-life.html)

“Consider this . . would you want to fly an airplane after watching a few webinars, reading a couple books and attending a seminar or two. Maybe so, but I wouldn’t want to be a passenger. Would you consider performing an appendectomy after watching a few videos on the procedure and attending a workshop on emergency surgical procedures. Sorry, but I wouldn’t want to be that patient. Trading for a living is a on-going learning process and here’s the shocker . . not everyone makes the cut. Forget the TV ads and blog banner ads promising risk free 80% returns in the first month of trading. Forget the slick magazine ads promoting expensive seminars and workshops with “guaranteed” trading success. It isn’t gonna happen. The only people making money on these deals are the seminar promoters.”

“……………but freedom is even more than that. Freedom is the ability to make one’s living by one’s judgment, and not being limited to subsistence through the toil of his or her hands. Freedom is the ability of a single individual sitting right here, right now, at a personal computer, to write words that can be read years later, in faraway lands. Freedom is downloading reams of market data and conducting research that, just years ago, would have taken weeks to complete. Freedom is the ability to see who is bidding, offering, buying, and selling in global marketplaces. It is the unfettered opportunity to participate in the economic vigor of developing nations.
Without freedom, there is no trading. Trading is a celebration of economic and political freedom. Slaves are traded; they do not trade.”

“My review of individuals who are widely considered to be great within their fields–athletics, science, arts, leadership–finds that they are lean in the same way. They find a field that captures their imagination and interest, and they tinker at it and work with it until they reach a high level of mastery. This constancy of purpose is driven by a love for the effort itself: a chess grandmaster or Olympic athlete seeks out opportunities to meet challenges and become the best they can be.”
