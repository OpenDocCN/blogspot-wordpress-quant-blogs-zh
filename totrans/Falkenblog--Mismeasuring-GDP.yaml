    as a separate field of study in the 1930's. Simon Kuznets and Richard Stone won
    Nobel prizes for developing these measures, and Keynes was so excited by their
    potential that he gushed 'the era of joy through statistics' is starting, as if
    merely measuring GDP would show us how to manage it. Usually, we expect important
    data to follow a pattern, especially one as intuitively cyclical as the aggregated
    economy.

    of motion for macro variables. No one uses these models any more. They were very
    clever and rigorous and may have applications elsewhere, but they are totally
    irrelevant to understanding the aggregate economy. Like so many social science
    theories they were a considered foundational at one time, but then the new generation
    with no intellectual stake in the models examined them and found them useless.
    Yet another example of fads in science, and the current macro paradigm is probably
    no less ephemeral.

    been around for decades, and are prominent in every Introductory texbook that
    goes over GDP. Nonetheless, GDP still dominates macroeconomics. Clearly GDP is
    correlated with ''true'' national income, and has the benefit of being fairly
    unambiguous.'

    to a very important problem, and you have nothing new, true and important to say,
    say nothing. Stiglitz and Sen's cluelessness here is not an anomaly.
