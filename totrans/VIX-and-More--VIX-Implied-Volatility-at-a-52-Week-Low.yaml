- en: The reason I bother mentioning any of this is that VIX call options closed yesterday
    with their lowest implied volatility reading of the past 52 weeks. So if you think
    the market is getting toppy, but you are reluctant to go long the VIX because
    it is still a fair distance from single digits, consider that the volatility premium
    for VIX calls is as cheap as it has been in a long time.
