    I mentioned that this blog will devote more attention to [ETFs](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/ETFs)
    in the coming year. I have also decided that after three years of dancing around
    the subject, I will also be a little more explicit in talking about different
    [strategic approaches](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/trading%20strategies)
    to trading as well as specific strategies.

    I noticed a timely piece from [CXO Advisory Group](http://www.cxoadvisory.com/)
    with the title of [Simple Sector ETF Momentum Strategy Performance](http://www.cxoadvisory.com/blog/internal/blog12-22-09/).
    The article, which looks at three different [sector](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/sectors)
    [SPDR](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SPDRs) momentum strategies,
    ultimately concludes that “simple sector ETF momentum strategies have generally
    outperformed the broad stock market over the past decade for reasonably low trading
    frictions.” As someone who actively trades sector rotation strategies, I can’t
    say I was surprised by the results, but I thought the analysis and charts made
    for excellent reading – and are certainly worth a click through.

    the work that [TradingMarkets.com](http://www.tradingmarkets.com/) has done with
    ETFs in the context of their [ETF PowerRatings](http://pr.tradingmarkets.com/etf/).
    Anyone familiar with the work of Larry Connors will see how some similar themes
    from previous publications have been adapted to the ETF world. Based on some introductory
    materials and a review of charts such as the [XLY](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLY)
    chart below, it appears as if the ratings give the highest marks to ETFs that
    have shown intermediate-term trend strength, followed by a recent pullback. In
    other words, the ratings make it easy to get long up trends or short downtrends
    after a pullback makes for high probability entry signals. Frankly, this is the
    type of strategic approach that I have had a lot of success with and it appears
    that the ETF PowerRatings implementation is a similar application to some of my
    thinking about ETFs.

    else to do all the analysis and generate entry and exit signals, [ETF Rewind](http://etfrewind.blogspot.com/)
    is at the other end of the spectrum. In ETF Rewind Pro, Jeff Pietsch has built
    an Excel-based set of data and analytics that is ideal for the ideal for the investor
    who likes to do their own analysis and roll their own strategies, but needs a
    platform on which to make it all happen. Earlier this year, in [Pairs Trading
    with ROB](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/08/pairs-trading-with-rob.html),
    I talked about some of the pairs trading applications that ETF Rewind can be used
    for. I failed to mention that ETF Rewind also comes with modules that generate
    both long and short weekly trend trading ideas, daily countertrend trading ideas
    and day trading candidates as well. Of course, most investors will also want to
    avail themselves of the almost encyclopedic collection of data for almost 200
    ETFs and use the data and tools to develop their own strategies.

    that utilizes a volatility-based ETF trading approach that I call EVALS (ETF Volatility
    Analysis Long/Short.) EVALS is unusual in that it is a trading approach which
    draws upon volatility-based indicators to trigger entries and exits. For more
    information, try [VIX and More EVALS](http://vixandmoreevals.blogspot.com/2008/08/vix-and-more-evals-etf-volatility_19.html)
    or check out the [EVALS blog](http://vixandmoreevals.blogspot.com/).
