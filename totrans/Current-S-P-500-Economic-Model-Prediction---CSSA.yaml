- en: 'In responding to feedback, the [economic model](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2019/05/14/shiny-new-toys/)
    has been revised for the sake of simplicity to provide a more useable dashboard.
    The output is the chance of a large correction classified into three categories
    (low, drawdown>10%, drawdown >15%) and the predicted direction for the S&P500
    over the next 90 days ( Bullish: >5% expected return, Sideways: >-5% <5% expected
    return, Bearish: <-5% expected return). Below is the current update. We will provide
    some backtests very soon, preliminary results are quite promising. [Investor IQ](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/investor-iq-2/)
    plans to launch a website soon to provide access to this model in real time along
    with current ETF and stock analytics.'
