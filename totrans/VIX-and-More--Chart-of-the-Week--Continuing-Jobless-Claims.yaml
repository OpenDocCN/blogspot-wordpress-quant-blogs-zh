    economic garden and the knowledge that it has been four weeks since initial [jobless
    claims](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/jobless%20claims) peaked at
    a level just below the October 1982 record, I wanted to provide a picture of continuing
    jobless claims that is very different from the more widely reported initial claims
    data.

    below tracks continuing jobless claims since 1967\. Whereas initial jobless claims
    (red line) are currently just below the 1982 record levels, continuing claims
    (blue line) have spiked to levels that dwarf 1982 levels by more than 30%.

    problem is that existing jobless workers are having an extremely difficult time
    finding new work. Unfortunately, after setting new records for 12 weeks in a row,
    the trend in continuing claims shows no sign of letting up at this time.
