- en: In addition, analysis from Bespoke indicated that we may be entering a period
    of negative seasonality from the US macro data. Historically, the Citigroup US
    Economic Surprise Index, which measures whether economic releases are beating
    or missing consensus estimates, has displayed a negative seasonal pattern every
    Spring. Should the macro data continue to follow this pattern, it may create headwinds
    for forward EPS estimates.

    stocks aren't cheap. The chart below shows that as the market advances in the
    face of falling EPS estimates, forward PE ratios have risen to levels not seen
    in the last 10 years. The Fed initiation of a tightening cycle will only add pressure
    for PE ratios to contract.

    exhibited by some breadth indicators. The middle panel of the chart below shows
    the SP 1500 advance-decline percentage, which is smoothed by a 20 day exponential
    moving average. The bottom panel shows the percentage of stocks in the SPX showing
    a buy signal on the point and figure chart. The combination of the negative divergence
    in these two indicators, the SP 1500 A-D and % SPX bullish, have signaled weakness
    in the past. The last time these indicators showed a negative divergence was (surprise!)
    the sideways consolidation period in early 2011.

    in the SPX with an RSI-5 above 70 (green line). The signal from this very short-term
    indicator could be interpreted in one of two ways. On one hand, the series of
    lower lows and lower highs are indicative that, even though the market has gone
    to all-time highs, this indicator is still relatively low and not overbought and
    therefore stocks could go higher. On the other hand, it is telling a story of
    a loss of momentum and negative breadth divergence, which is bearish.
