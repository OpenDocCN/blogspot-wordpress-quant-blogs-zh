    bulls are in control of this market in the intermediate term. The more relevant
    question is whether they have exhausted themselves in the short-term. Can the
    S+P 500 clear resistance or are we due for a period of consolidation?

    has been led by the large cap stocks. Small caps have not been as strong, which
    is a bearish negative divergence. As shown below, the small cap Russell 2000 is
    barely approaching its resistance zone, though it is in a similar well-defined
    uptrend.

    place. I analyzed the chart patterns of the cyclicals, as well as the other two
    sources of macro risk, Europe and China. Consider the Morgan Stanley Cyclicals
    Index. These stocks staged an upside breakout in mid-January, but have started
    to consolidate as they moved sideways through the uptrend line.

    the Australian All-Ords, the Canadian Dollar and the TSX Index all show a pattern

    downtrend in mid-January and they appear to be consolidating. I am watching to
    see if the sideways pattern continues or if they can stage an upside breakout
    through resistance.

    a glimpse of how they are faring in the early months of 2012, the number of companies
    offering downbeat guidance continues to exceed those steering analysts’ forecasts
    higher. So far, 52 companies in the S+P 500 have issued negative earning guidance
    compared to 20 that have issued positive earnings guidance for the first quarter
    of 2012; the resulting ratio of negative to positive preannouncements is 2.6\.
    ***While that’s still not telling investors that corporate executives are bullish,
    it’s a significantly more positive reading than the N/P ration of 3.6 observed
    as recently as last week.***
