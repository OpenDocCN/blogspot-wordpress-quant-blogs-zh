    on those same quantitative and theoretical principles, called Value at Risk, continued
    to be widely used. It was this that was to blame for the crisis....Few people
    would agree that the illusion of knowledge is a good thing. Almost everyone would
    accept that the failure in 1998 of Long Term Capital Management discredited the
    quantitative methods of the Nobel economists involved with it (Robert Merton and
    Myron Scholes) and their school of thought called “modern finance”...Ask for the
    Nobel prize in economics to be withdrawn from the authors of these theories, as
    the Nobel’s credibility can be extremely harmful. Boycott professional associations
    that give certificates in financial analysis that promoted these methods. Remove
    Value-at-Risk books from the shelves – quickly.

    absurd. Long Term Capital Management (LTCM) went down because they became too

    to get out at any price, and like Niederhoffer getting busted in 1997, the market
    will punish you for becoming too big. Thus, the main trades that took down LTCM
    were a Treasury-Eurodollar trade, a volatility trade (trade on volatility via
    over-the-counter derivatives), and directional bets in emerging markets. Scholes
    and Merton were primarily marketing props, not strategizers, and they were punished
    as investors lost something like 95% of their capital. Thus, perhaps Merton and
    Scholes let themselves be used by people who took too much risk, but the validity
    of the Black-Scholes/Merton option model was independent of LTCM''s business model.
    The recent downturn also, is pretty independent of the Black-Scholes/Merton model.'

- en: Value at Risk is a broad concept, that basically is a framework that has as
    its goal estimating a 99% or 95% worst-case-scenario, over an arbitrary period
    of time (day, week, year). Now, clearly many people underestimated the risk in
    mortgage-backed paper of all sorts, but this error was not particular to Value
    at Risk, rather, the assumption that housing prices would not decline, which then
    lead to errors in your stress test, or whatever you call your 'worst case scenario'.
    This error was made at many levels, by investors, issuers, rating agencies, banks
    who warehoused these loans, regulators, etc. Again, Value at Risk is pretty independent
    of this error, though the error would be reflected in any VAR that had such erroneous
    assumptions (garbage in, garbage out). Further, Value at risk is pretty agnostic
    as to method, whether you use data with really fat tails, 99.99% worst case scenarios,
    whatever you want. Blaming Value at Risk for the latest crisis is like blaming
    soup, rather than sanitation, for Typhoid Mary.

    in recent events vindicating his worldview, but as Taleb knows, there are always
    ''lucky fools'' who merely were fortunate. I would like to see a risk management
    report from Taleb, perhaps a page always saying "risk=inf", because of course,
    we could lose everything in WW3, a new virus, all the banks fail, etc. Every assumption
    isn''t true, so make no assumptions. Be prepared for anything. Go long volatility
    (especially extreme tails). I don''t think that''s very good advice, though clearly
    it worked great this year (and funds he''s affiliated have done very well, being
    long tail volatility).'

    rather thinking that he has financial academy on the ropes by the weight of his
    best-seller The Black Swan. Indeed, he notes "So how can we displace a fraud?
    Not by preaching nor by rational argument (believe us, we tried). Not by evidence."
    So much for reasoned debate. But regardless of popularity, there needs to be something
    more specific than his strident calls to stop using Value-at-Risk, option models,
    and portfolio theory from business schools. What sort of principles are we going
    to teach? Clearly reality is more complicated than these models, but there are
    some good ideas in there, and they do have many applications, though one need
    common sense in applying these tools fruitfully. Perhaps, MBA's should be taught
    common sense? That is, in some sense, the case-study approach of the Harvard Business
    School, which walks through various scenarios, with all their idiosyncrasies,
    and while I think this is very useful as part of a curriculum, it needs to be
    balanced with boring tools, like learning about covariance and how that affects
    portfolio risk.
