    comment system for the blog. I did this for several reasons, but at the top of
    the list were the ability to have multiple threaded discussions under each post
    and my growing lack of patience with comment spam, which Disqus seems to do a
    good job with.

    Books” widget to the right hand column, just above the “VIX – Educational Posts”
    content area. The widget rotates four of my nine favorite options books. The full
    list can be found at [Amazon: Favorite Options Books](http://astore.amazon.com/vianmo-20).
    Going forward, I will start reviewing options and other trading books.'

- en: The need for easy access book recommendations (a frequent reader request via
    email) and other resources has persuaded me to expand the blog in order to incorporate
    much more ‘permanent’ content. My intent is to continue the blog in its current
    form, but augment it with easy to find permanent content areas that include a
    good deal of educational materials, groups of introductory posts on a variety
    of subjects, book reviews, links to a broad range of options and other investment
    resources, etc. I have no specific timetable, but the decision has finally been
    made in my head to move *VIX and More* from a quirky little corner of the blogosphere
    to more of a destination site covering options, market sentiment, ETFs and related
    subjects.
