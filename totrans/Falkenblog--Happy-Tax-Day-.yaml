- en: This year I had to write a check because I rolled my 401(k) into a Roth IRA,
    generating a lot of taxable income that had no withholding. To give an example,
    say I put $5k into my IRA each year for the past 20 years. Say it grew to $200k.
    By rolling it into a Roth IRA, I am taking that $200k in taxable income for 2010,
    and so have to pay state and federal taxes on that, but then it will increase,
    hopefully, tax free. I'm basically betting on rising taxes for investments, as
    this makes sense if you think tax rates will be higher in the future than currently.
    Of course, I'm also betting the government won't reneg on the Roth IRA terms and
    tax me again. Interestingly, I'm finding that my state tax payment is about 1/3
    my federal. Then I have property taxes of about 2% of my assessed house value
    for my city, which basically rigs the rate vs. assessment so that my payment is
    constant.

  zh: 今年我不得不写一张支票，因为我将401(k)转入了罗斯IRA，产生了大量无预扣税的收入。举个例子，假设我过去20年每年向IRA存入$5k，现在它增值到了$200k。通过转入罗斯IRA，我实际上将这$200k作为2010年的应税收入，因此需要支付州和联邦税，但之后它有望免税增长。我基本上是在押注未来投资税率会上升，如果你认为未来税率将高于当前，这样做是有道理的。当然，我也在赌政府不会违背罗斯IRA的条款再次对我征税。有趣的是，我发现我的州税大约是联邦税的1/3。此外，我所在城市的房产税约为房屋评估价值的2%，这基本上设定了税率与评估值的比例，使得我的税款保持恒定。
