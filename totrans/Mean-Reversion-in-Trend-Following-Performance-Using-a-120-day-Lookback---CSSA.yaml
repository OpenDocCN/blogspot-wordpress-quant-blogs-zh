    we showed that trend-following tends to be mean-reverting in the short-term. Data
    analysis also shows that trend-following has an even stronger mean-reverting effect
    using a 6-month or 120-day window using the same methodology. Take a look at the
    chart below using the BarclayHedge SG Trend Index:'

- en: In the last post I hypothesized that the mean-reversion effect exists because
    investors tend to chase recent performance. But there is obviously a lot more
    going on that drives the performance of trend-followers including lower interest
    rates, higher correlations, and generally less pronounced trends. Certainly monetary
    policy worldwide has also played a factor. [A very good paper by Spring Valley](https://www.springvalleyam.com/ctas-in-perspective)
    analyzes some of the factors that have affected trend-following performance. Ultimately
    the data suggests that you need to incorporate this effect into your strategy
    or asset allocation methodology in order to be more consistently profitable using
    a trend-following approach.
