- en: I found it interesting that the SPY put in an outside day and closed down after
    closing at a short-term high Monday. Outside reversal bars such as Tuesday's are
    often viewed as bearish by many traders. I ran a study to examine the potential
    significance of this kind of bar.

- en: Results here are similar to other studies I’ve run on outside day or key reversal
    bars in the past. It is often followed by a few days of weakness but it rarely
    marks the kind of significant top it is renowned for.

- en: Recall though that Monday's study did suggest the possibility of an intermediate-term
    top, so it is a possibility. In any case, a few days of weakness here would be
    typical.
