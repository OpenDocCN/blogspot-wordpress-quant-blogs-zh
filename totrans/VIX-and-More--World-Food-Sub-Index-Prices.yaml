    it involves that Holy Grailesque quest to cram every potentially relevant piece
    of data into one overcrowded chart.

- en: 'Yesterday’s [Chart of the Week: World Food Prices](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2011/01/chart-of-week-world-food-prices.html)
    is an example of a relatively uncluttered chart that attempts to make one or two
    simple points in a relatively clear and concise manner. After some back and forth
    with several readers, I have elected to butcher that simplicity and unveil a chart
    which adds the five sub-indices: meat; dairy; cereal; oils and sugar. The result,
    which I have appended below, shows that the real wild card in world food prices
    has been sugar, which is represented on the chart by the green line. To a lesser
    extent, cereal, dairy and oil have had their moments of extreme price fluctuations.
    By far the least volatile of the five sub-groups has been meat.'

    these [commodity](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/commodities) sub-indices,
    there are a number of broad-based agricultural ETFs which cover most or all of
    the sub-indices. The popular PowerShares DB Agriculture Fund ([DBA](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/DBA))
    is by far the most liquid of the group. Alternatives to DBA include [RJA](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/RJA),
    [JJA](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/JJA), [FUD](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/FUD)
    and [UAG](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/UAG). For investors looking
    to target grains, [JJG](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/JJG) and [GRU](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/GRU)
    are worth investigating, as is the corn-specific ETP, [CORN](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/CORN).
    For the sugar sub-index, [SGG](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SGG)
    is an excellent match. [JJS](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/JJS)
    is an ETP for the ‘softs’ space and is almost equally weighted between coffee,
    cotton and sugar. Finally, both [COW](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/COW)
    and [UBC](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/UBC) are potential proxies
    for the meat sub-index.
