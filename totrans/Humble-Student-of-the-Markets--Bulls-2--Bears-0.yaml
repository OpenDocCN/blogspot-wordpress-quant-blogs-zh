    news. By any measure, the bulls appear to have seized control of the helm based
    on yesterday's market action..

    rally through a downtrend that began in March. While the index may not necessarily
    head straight up from here, the technical outlook for Chinese stocks is far less
    bearish than it was a week ago. Score one for the bulls.

    and closed near the highs of the day. As I wrote yesterday, the STOXX 600 had
    staged an upside breakout through technical resistance. The index not only held
    on to its breakout but closed higher on the day, which is bullish.

    be watching closely Wednesday to see the market reaction to the FOMC decision.
    From what I have seen so far, it looks like the Santa Claus rally is underway.
