## Microsoft Surface – Back Online With Bing Maps

The Lab49 Microsoft [Surface](http://www.fastcompany.com/blog/chris-dannen/techwatch/killer-apps-microsoft-surface-complete-guide) died sometime ago – bulb issue. In the last week a replacement bulb turned up from Redmond, so our surface is now back online 🙂 We’ve just added [Bing](http://theclevermonkey.blogspot.com/2009/05/infostratve-virtual-earth-for-surface.html) [Maps](http://bingmapswpf.codeplex.com/) to the Surface – not sure how we missed this [before](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee804847.aspx).
