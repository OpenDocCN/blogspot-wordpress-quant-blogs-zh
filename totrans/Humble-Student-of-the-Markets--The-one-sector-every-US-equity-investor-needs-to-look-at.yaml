    thought about was the kind of sectors that he wanted exposure to. Preferably,
    these sectors of the market should have a history of consistent outperformance
    and should be able to weather the stock market`s up-and-downs. It wouldn't hurt
    either if they had some growth characteristics as value sectors eventually appreciate
    and lose their value characteristics.

- en: As the chart of the relative performance of the Healthcare sector (XLV) to the
    SPX shows, this sector has been in a well-defined relative uptrend and has shown
    consistent market leadership qualities. I also show the relative performance of
    specific industry groups within the sector, namely Biotech (IBB), Healthcare Providers
    (IHF) and Pharmaceutical (PJP). These industry groups, in all cases, show similar
    histories of outperformance, though IHF appears to be slightly extended in the
    short-term (dotted trend line).

    was that Healthcare could be in a bubble and therefore subject to sudden downdrafts
    as Technology did in 2000 and Financials did in 2008.

- en: When a particular sector outperforms the others, it grows as a percentage of
    the index and at the expense of its counterparts. But no one sector today is even
    20% of the index. Tech stocks come closest, with 19.3% of the index. But this
    figure is far below the level of 14 years ago when tech claimed 32.6% of the index.
    Tech stocks have performed particularly well over the past year, gaining about
    32% on average, but over the past five years both consumer discretionary/cyclical
    and health-care stocks have fared slightly better.

- en: Speaking of health care, even with its strong five-year returns (20% annualized
    on average), that sector’s weighting is also below its high. While never on par
    with tech or financials as a share of the index, that group did claim 15.5% of
    the index in March 2003 versus 13.4% currently.

    long term market bulls, this sector and its industries might be just what the
    doctor ordered.
