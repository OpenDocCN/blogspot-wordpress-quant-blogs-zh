    this: The European Commission has very firm plans to introduce a financial transactions
    tax -- a "Tobin" style tax -- on most financial transactions at the beginning
    of January 2014\. That''s just over 6 months away. I was surprised to learn they
    were taking this step, as I thought that very little was really known about the
    likely consequence of such a tax, especially introduced on such a grand scale.
    So, I spent a week or so looking into all the research I could find on financial
    transactions taxes, theoretical and empirical, and came to the conclusion that
    -- indeed, very little is known. But Europe is going ahead anyway!'

    and, if appropriately designed, could make a significant contribution to revenue
    without causing major distortions. However, it would be unlikely to reduce market
    volatility and could even increase it.

    depend on fine details of how the tax is implemented and of the markets to which
    it is applied.

    how the consequences of a transactions tax might depend on market microstructure.
    I think this is among the most sophisticated studies done to date (although it
    can still be improved in many ways and represents a beginning, not an end). There's
    also an older review from 1993 by Schwert and Seguin that I read and which is
    useful (sadly, I'm not sure where the link is.... I have a pdf and found it by
    googling, that's all I can say). Finally, if you have the brave heart to read
    the original impact assessment of the EC proposal for the tax,

    influence markets, but only looks at how the macroeconomy might be effected.
