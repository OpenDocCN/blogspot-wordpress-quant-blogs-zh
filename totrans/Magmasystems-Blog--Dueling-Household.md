My wife, the superstar

[Wharton](http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/)

grad who walks on water, started at a new client yesterday. She is managing a large team doing a rewrite of an existing credit derivatives system for a Tier-1 financial powerhouse who is not the same Tier-1 that I am currently consulting for.

Their technology is 100% Java.... not surprising, since all of the architecture has been done by a very Java-centric major consulting firm.

Dinner conversation should be very interesting for the next few months.....
