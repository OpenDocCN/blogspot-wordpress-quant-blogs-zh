    am reiterating many of my comments from the last few weeks. Since mid-February,
    I have been using 2011 as a rough roadmap for the behavior of the equity market,
    largely because of the parallels with Greece. I believed that the market would
    see a series of choppy up and down moves and the pattern would resolve itself
    with a bullish trend as the political and financial difficulties resolved themselves
    (see

    and down choppy action, which moved the market to an oversold reading on the 5-day
    RSI (blue vertical lines). It then staged an upside breakout, consolidated sideways
    and then pulled back below the breakout level. It finally resolved itself by staging
    a sustained rally after the pullback test (red vertical line).

    Note the instances of short-term oversold readings marked by the vertical lines.
    In some cases, the market rebounded right away. In another, it required a final
    flush before seeing a durable bottom.

    in major equity market indices. We are seeing upside breakouts in the FTSE 100,
    a continued uptrend in the Euro STOXX 50 and an upside breakout in the Shanghai
    Composite. The US market, as measured by the SPX, is somewhat of a laggard in
    that sense as it has only staged an upside breakout of the old resistance level
    at about 2093 and it has not tested its all-time highs yet. This kind of across
    the board global momentum is very bullish.

    Neither the 5-day RSI (top panel), which is useful for short-term trading, the
    14-day RSI (second panel), which is more useful for spotting intermediate term
    tops and bottoms, are overbought. Moreover, these indicators are exhibiting positive
    momentum, which is are confirmations of recent strength.

    pattern and the index has rallied above the breakout point as a sign of market
    strength. Moreover, the more broadly based Wiltshire 5000 also displays the breakout
    and pullback pattern and moved to test its old highs on Friday.

    to the MSCI All-Country World Index. There are three major reasons to be overweight
    the US equity market. First, it remains in a relative uptrend compared to global
    stocks. It got ahead of itself in late December and early January and has since
    retreated from those excesses. Finally, sentiment readings (see above FMS chart)
    is tilted bearish, which is contrarian bullish.

    later this year, US equities could get the jitters and pull back. For now, the
    path of least resistance for stock prices is up.

    long, but he is closely watching sentiment and momentum indicators should the
    SPX test its highs next week, which it will likely do. The market may become short-term
    overbought at that point and it may be prudent to trim back some long positions,
    but I don't want to be anticipating model readings. I will be updating any developments
    on my Twitter account @humblestudent during the week.
