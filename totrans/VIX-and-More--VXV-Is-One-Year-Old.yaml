    which is a variant of the VIX that calculates implied volatility in SPX options
    over the course of the next 93 days instead of the 30 day time window used by
    the VIX.

    and suggested in [The VIX:VXV Ratio](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/12/vixvxv-ratio.html)
    that comparing the relative levels in the VIX and VXV might serve as an important
    market timing signal in a way that is analogous to [VIX term structure](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/term%20structure)
    data.

    in September 2008, the [VIX:VXV ratio](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%3AVXV)
    performed nearly flawlessly, generating timely buy and sell signals. In a post-Lehman
    world, however, the VIX:VXV ratio has struggled with a bullish bias as the markets
    have headed down.

    the VIX:VXV might be applied. Since that time, I have made a number of enhancements
    for my personal use that I have yet to post about on the blog. A couple of those
    enhancements now suggest that the pre-Lehman threshold levels such as 1.10 and
    0.90 are once again relevant. This would make the current VIX:VXV ratio of 1.12
    an excellent buying opportunity.

- en: For a long time, I was the only person who talked about the VIX:VXV ratio. Over
    the course of the past year, however, it has generated a strong following. Now
    that readers have a year of data to digest and a broad range of market conditions
    in which to evaluate the indicator, what enhancements or modifications to the
    VIX:VXV ratio would you suggest? Feel free to discuss this in the comments section
    below.
