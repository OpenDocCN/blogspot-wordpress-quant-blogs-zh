# Humble Student of the Markets: Commodities poised for revival

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2013/06/commodities-poised-for-revival.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2013/06/commodities-poised-for-revival.html#0001-01-01)

Yesterday's stock market selloff was an event that we haven't seen in some time, as major averages fell over 1% across the board - and globally. Nevertheless, I saw a glimmer of hope for the bulls, as commodities were performing well despite the carnage. If a deep cyclical sector like that is displaying rising relative strength, it suggests that the end of this correction may not be too far off.

**Commodities unloved and washed out**

Simply put, the commodities complex is unloved, washed out and showing signs of investor capitulation. The chart below from BoAML shows the aggregate large speculator (read: hedge fund) net position from the Commitment of Traders report in the CRB Index. Large speculators have liquidated their net long positions from a near crowded long level to net short. Moreover, readings are consistent where declines have halted in the past.

Here in Canada, the junior resource companies are beyond washed out. The chart below of the relative performance of the junior TSX Venture Index against the more senior TSX Composite is at all-time lows - and below the level of the capitulation lows seen following the Lehman Crisis.

Here in Vancouver, which is the heart of junior mining country, I personally know of scores of well-qualified people who are in the industry who are struggling with the difficult environment.

**Green shoots**

In the midst of this bleak landscape, I am seeing nascent signs of recovery for the sector. What is encouraging was the positive performance shown during yesterday's ugly selloff. One of the top recent performers has been industrial metals, which has:

1.  Rallied through a downtrend;
2.  Staged an upside breakout through a wedge; and
3.  Staged an upside breakout through a resistance level yesterday - which was impressive given the headwinds provided by the risk trade.

At the same time, gold seems to have made a temporary bottom and it's starting to grind upwards as the precious metal is displaying nascent upside strength.

I am watching carefully the Brent price, which is a better proxy for world oil prices, for signs of an upside breakout through a downtrend. We almost achieved the breakout yesterday, but not quite.

The relative performance of energy stocks against the market is starting to show positive relative strength, which is another early warning of shifting leadership.

**Macro and market implications**

While I understand that commodities and commodity related stocks are unloved, washed out and poised to rally. These combination of sold-out sentiment and early signs of rising relative strength are pointing to a recovery in these sectors.

From a macro perspective, the recovery of deep cyclical sectors like these are consistent with a relatively upbeat outlook for growth economic growth. In that case, the environment for equities is encouraging and any correction should be relatively shallow - barring any macro surprises,
