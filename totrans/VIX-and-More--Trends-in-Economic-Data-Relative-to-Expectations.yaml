    the performance of key economic data releases relative to consensus expectations.

    expectations. I then aggregate the data over time to see the extent to which certain
    segments of the economy are trending higher or lower relative to expectations.

- en: The chart below summarizes the trends in these five categories since the beginning
    of the year. In terms of performance relative to expectations, manufacturing (solid
    black line) has performed best, though the trend has turned down for the last
    two months or so. Not surprisingly, the worst performing area – by a considerable
    margin – has been employment (solid red line), where the trend relative to expectations
    has been consistently negative since the middle of April.
