# Humble Student of the Markets: China saves the world

When my

flashed

[an asset inflation signal on February 6, 2012](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2012/02/buy-growth-and-inflation-hedge-vehicles.html)

to buy high beta and high octane inflation hedge and emerging market stocks, the major risk to the bullish forecast was a Chinese hard landing. One of the key indicators that I was watching at the time was the Shanghai Composite, which had been in a well-defined downtrend.

All that has changed. Since I wrote those words in early February, the Shanghai Composite has managed to stage a rally through the downtrend, signaling that China's hard landing scenario is becoming less likely.

Indeed,

[Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/15/uk-china-economy-policy-idUSTRE8170K620120215)

reported the PBoC indicated that it is prepared to ease policy gradually in order to keep inflation in check:

> In its monetary policy implemention report for the fourth quarter of 2011, the central bank said it will use a mix of policy tools, including interest rates, to maintain reasonable credit growth while keeping a lid on inflation.

Next door in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index has already rallied through its downtrend line and the 200-day moving average at about the same time, which is another signal of global healing and recovery.

Now that both the Shanghai Composite and Hang Seng Index have rallied through their respective downtrend lines and the fundamentals are becoming more positive, it seems that China is in the process of confirming the global bull move in risky assets. In fact, it's saving the world as it indicated that

[it would continue to buy euro denominated debt](http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/15/us-china-europe-idUSTRE81E07J20120215)

, which it said it would do once the Europeans got their act together (and it is in the Chinese self-interest as Europe is a major export market).

These developments confirm my recent observations that we are seeing a intermediate term bull market in stocks and risky asssets.

So party on and let's rock 'n roll!
