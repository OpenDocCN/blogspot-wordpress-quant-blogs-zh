    Part of the reason I am so excited about weeklys is that I would not have made
    the trade had only standard monthly options been available.

    that we would have choppy trading on Tuesday through Thursday, as investors chose
    to sit on the sidelines in advance of Friday’s [nonfarm payrolls](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/nonfarm%20payrolls)
    report.

    and my preferred underlying was [IWM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/IWM),
    the iShares Russell 2000 Index ETF. When I looked at the available options, the
    weeklys almost jumped off of the page, with superb liquidity and much higher [implied
    volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/implied%20volatility).
    As the intent of my trade was to take maximum advantage of [time decay](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/time%20decay)
    ([theta](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/theta)), choosing the weeklys
    were a no-brainer.

    options that expire this Friday (red line) and the standard monthly options that
    expire the following week (yellow line.) All things being equal (and they never
    are) the higher implied volatility of the shorter-dated weeklys translates into
    substantially higher time decay.

    cycle, take a close look at the weeklys. If you are not comfortable doing this
    (controlling [gamma](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/gamma) risk is
    critical), then perhaps future posts on weekly options will assist in this regard.
