- en: Speaking at length about the competing ideologies surrounding regulation, Summers
    distinguished between one side worrying that regulators will become "co-opted"
    by a conflict of interest, and the other afraid regulators are simply "ignorant"
    of the institutions they are charged with controlling. "There is hardly anyone,"
    Summers said, "that is both knowledgeable and [sic] unco-opted."

  zh: 谈及围绕监管的不同意识形态时，萨默斯区分了一方担心监管者会被“腐蚀”而陷入利益冲突，另一方则害怕监管者简单地对他们负责的机构“无知”。萨默斯说：“几乎没有人在知识渊博的同时也[原文有错]没有被腐蚀”。
- en: It's an insoluble problem in the public sector because anyone really knowledgeable
    is more valuable within one of the firms he regulates rather than outside it,
    creating a constant brain drain. There are exceptions to be sure, but the talent
    will always disproportionately on the inside. Financial entities make money in
    very complex ways, making an outsider's job very difficult even if able and motivated.
    When I have seen regulators, invariably they are focusing on some check list developed
    in Washington that is so irrelevant.

  zh: 这是公共部门一个无法解决的问题，因为真正富有知识的人在他所监管的公司内比在外面更有价值，导致不断的人才流失。当然会有例外，但是人才总是内部的比重会更大。金融实体以非常复杂的方式赚钱，使得局外人的工作即使有能力和动力也非常困难。当我看到监管者时，他们总是把重点放在华盛顿制定的一些与实际情况无关的清单上。
- en: 'The key to managing government this century has been to remove individual authority.
    The abuses of the spoils system of a century ago are far more vivid in the modern
    mind than the bureaucratic inertia that slowly drains our national vitality. Bureaucrats
    have discovered one best way to avoid blame: by creating systems in which no one
    has the ability to do anything not in a rulebook created years ago by bureaucrats
    who haven''t been on the front line.'

  zh: 本世纪管理政府的关键是消除个人权力。一世纪前的掠夺体系的滥用在现代人的记忆中远比慢慢耗尽我们国家活力的官僚惯性更加活跃。官僚们已经发现了一种最好的方法来避嫌：那就是创造一套系统，让没有人有能力去执行规章制度，这些规章制度是多年前由官僚制定的，而这些官僚们早已不在最前线了。
- en: Effective regulators, when they exist, are free to make the countless judgments
    needed to make something good happen, as when an analyst decides that a bank is
    a 'sell'. Yet this now only happens to firms so weak they are already almost dead,
    protecting us only after the damage has been done.

  zh: 有效的监管者，当存在时，可以自由地做出无数判断，以促成一些好事发生，就像分析师决定将一家银行卖掉一样。然而，现在只有弱到几乎已经奄奄一息的公司才会发生这种情况，这样的保护只是在损害已经造成之后才出现。
- en: For over a hundred years we have been erecting regulatory systems designed to
    add licensing and other criteria that supposedly make things safe. But no system
    of licensing, nor any regulatory system, no matter how brilliantly conceived,
    will function as intended unless humans have primacy over ultimate judgments ant
    every level of responsibility. When people focus on compliance instead of making
    sense of the situation, you get irrelevancy.

  zh: 一百多年来，我们一直在建立监管系统，旨在添加许可和其他标准，据称这些标准能确保安全。但是，除非人类在各个责任层面上拥有最终判断权，否则任何许可系统，任何监管系统，无论其设计得多么精巧，都将无法起到预期的作用。当人们关注的是顺从规则而不是理解情况时，你会得到不相关的东西。
- en: Holding people and companies responsible for their actions is the most important
    way of enforcing genuine ethical and efficient behavior, and I don't see how government
    regulators can do this. Remember, the best regulator ever invented is competition,
    which involves breaking down barriers to entry, and expediting the failure process
    that is an essential part of competition (including defaults with loss of principal,
    foreclosures), is the exact opposite of what most regulations actually do.
