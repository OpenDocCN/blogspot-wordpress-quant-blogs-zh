    distinguished between one side worrying that regulators will become "co-opted"
    by a conflict of interest, and the other afraid regulators are simply "ignorant"
    of the institutions they are charged with controlling. "There is hardly anyone,"
    Summers said, "that is both knowledgeable and [sic] unco-opted."

    is more valuable within one of the firms he regulates rather than outside it,
    creating a constant brain drain. There are exceptions to be sure, but the talent
    will always disproportionately on the inside. Financial entities make money in
    very complex ways, making an outsider's job very difficult even if able and motivated.
    When I have seen regulators, invariably they are focusing on some check list developed
    in Washington that is so irrelevant.

    The abuses of the spoils system of a century ago are far more vivid in the modern
    mind than the bureaucratic inertia that slowly drains our national vitality. Bureaucrats
    have discovered one best way to avoid blame: by creating systems in which no one
    has the ability to do anything not in a rulebook created years ago by bureaucrats
    who haven''t been on the front line.'

    needed to make something good happen, as when an analyst decides that a bank is
    a 'sell'. Yet this now only happens to firms so weak they are already almost dead,
    protecting us only after the damage has been done.

    add licensing and other criteria that supposedly make things safe. But no system
    of licensing, nor any regulatory system, no matter how brilliantly conceived,
    will function as intended unless humans have primacy over ultimate judgments ant
    every level of responsibility. When people focus on compliance instead of making
    sense of the situation, you get irrelevancy.

- en: Holding people and companies responsible for their actions is the most important
    way of enforcing genuine ethical and efficient behavior, and I don't see how government
    regulators can do this. Remember, the best regulator ever invented is competition,
    which involves breaking down barriers to entry, and expediting the failure process
    that is an essential part of competition (including defaults with loss of principal,
    foreclosures), is the exact opposite of what most regulations actually do.
