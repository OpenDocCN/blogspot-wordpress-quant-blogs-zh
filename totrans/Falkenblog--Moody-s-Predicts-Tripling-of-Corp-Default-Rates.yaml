    ratings on the disastrous 'mortgage innovations'. I think this criticism is largely
    overplayed, in that everyone was drinking the Kool-Aid pre-crisis, so their errors
    are those manifested by academics, regulators, legislators, businessmen, and investors.
    They didn't set the absurd mortgage lending zeitgeist in motion, merely enabled
    it with many others. If the current crisis is like World War II, the Rating Agencies
    would not be Hitler, rather Siemens.

    point, they are sure to error on the other side going forward. As a risk manager,
    predicting doom and gloom has an obvious advantage, one reason they are so often
    ignored. People are much more foregiving of an overly pessimistic forecast than
    an overly optimistic one, so the costs of missing in one direction are clearly
    skewed towards encouraging the 'Roubini' scenarios. Consider all the lawsuits
    in the pipeline against the Ratings Agencies, and note the absence of lawsuits
    for whenever defaults were below average.

    have you heard of a risk manager getting an extra bonus for predicting low probability
    events won''t happen that subsequently don''t? There''s good reason for this,
    because coming up with improbabilities (Black Swans) that won''t happen is like
    paying a computer programmer to find and fix bugs: the supply is infinite. So,
    risk manager warnings are like the ''check engine'' light. When it''s on, it usually
    means the ''check engine'' light is broken.'

    out of the 89 years of data on this series. Well below the 2001, 1990, and 1970
    peaks. The prediction (see top graph) for a 16% default rate in 2010 is for a
    record year in defaults, higher than any year, including the peak of 15.4% in
    1933\. If the

    someone who built their earlier model back in 1999 and there were ridiculously
    few observations, because basically you then had two default peaks for post WW2
    data: 1970 and 1990\. The data is highly serially correlated, implying the number
    of observations vastly overstates the degrees of freedom in that sample. Thus,
    it had the challenges of all time series forecasting in that environment. As the
    Thumper noted in Bambi, "if you can''t say something nice, don''t say anything
    at all." Therefore.'

    Transition Model. This model uses recent credit transitions, an unemployment rate
    forecast, and current high yield spreads. The recent credit transitions are clearly
    negative, and so projecting those forward is sure to generate an increase in default
    rates. The unemployment rate is going up, but how that correlates with defaults
    is non trivial (even though it defines the Geithner stess tests, this is still
    not much to hang a forecast upon). But are High Yield spreads correlated with

    high yield spreads did not add much information, as much as people like to highlight
    how forward looking they are. Clearly, a bond trading well below par is in trouble,
    and this is useful information for a specific company, but the hypothesis that
    aggregate high yield spreads predicts future default rates, in the context of
    historical default rates, is doubtful. Nonetheless, the new model shows an eerily
    accurate forecast over the past 15 years (from the Moody's Credit Transition Model

    these are invariably fit to that data. Indeed, reading the Moody''s Annual Default
    report from 1999 published in January 2000 before the market melted, we have this
    little prediction about the future default rates: a decline in the speculative
    grade default rate, to ''between 6.0% and 4.5%", but "trending downward over the
    year", with increasing recovery rates. They noted we were moving away from the
    ''Asian Crisis'' of 1998, and so were like all risk managers, oblivious to the
    next crisis but astutely aware of the most recent one. What happened, of course,
    was that default rates doubled, peaking in 2001\. But that was before the New
    Credit Transition Model, which as shown above, predicts with an R2 that would
    shame any back-fitting statistician. Given high credit spreads and the incentives
    they face, the backtesting and inner workings of that model are largely irrelevant.'

    to be better, but in reality it shows the same lack of intellectual courage. I
    don't blame them, the cost-benefit asymmetry at this point clearly suggests shareholder
    value is maximized by re-affirming the disaster scenario implicit in high yield
    spreads, but if i wanted to see what high yield spreads implied about future default
    rates I would look at high yield spreads, not Moody's.

    better than simple auto-regressive moving average (ARMA) models, so it's pointless
    to try. Best to focus on what quants can do, pick relative winners and losers.
    I remember once meeting a new consumer credit risk executive back in the late
    1990s, and she told me that instead of predicting relative default rates by obligors,
    it would be great to be able to avoid the next recession. True, but part of being
    a professional credit executive is knowing the difference between what you can
    predict and what you can't. Moody's should simply stop forecasting aggregate default
    rates. They don't add any value here and merely highlight that for anything many
    people already have an opinion on, Moody's is not a special lens, but rather a
    mirror.
