    I think that one key area of that is the seeking of yield. I will say it plainly:
    Wall Street can give you whatever yield you like, if you don’t care about preservation
    of principal. [Yield is the oldest scam in the books](http://alephblog.com/2010/06/03/yield-the-oldest-scam-in-the-books/).'

    because we are in a low yield environment, and they will bring these products
    out more often as a result.

    vehicles (that usually turn out badly) offered to investors. A great example is
    the buy-write strategy. Proponents point to charts below that show a buy-write
    index appears to have outperformed the market with lower volatility.

    received does cushion the decline, it is an uphill battle to make up the loss
    while having to sell call options. I have reproduced the above chart but with
    the indices set to 100 at the March 2009 bottom to illustrate my point.

    into buy-write strategies on the high flying TMT (Tech, Media, Telecom) stocks
    (e.g. Lucent, Adelphia, etc.) because the option premiums were very high. Sure,
    investors got extra income, but their capital in many cases went to zero.

    said that she had some money in a fund that yielded 10%, when market yield were
    in the mid single digits. As a matter of personal interest, I called up her stockbroker
    and asked how it is the fund was achieving that level of yield. It turned out
    to be a buy-write fund that was "targeting a yield of 10%".

    yield that you need through ordinary vanilla products that are transparent, then
    either reduce your spending or consume a little capital.  Wall Street and insurance
    companies thrive on complexity, because you can’t price it or do comparisons. 
    You are playing their rigged game; they may not be trying to skin you, but just
    nick you.
