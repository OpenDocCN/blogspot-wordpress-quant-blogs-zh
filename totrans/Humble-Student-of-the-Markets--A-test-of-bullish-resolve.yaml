- en: ': Last weekend, I wrote that while I was intermediate term bullish, I expected
    some equity market weakness early in the week. The hourly RSI-5 had exceeded 90,
    which is an extremely overbought reading, which was not sustainable. Even during
    the January melt-up, such episodes resolved themselves with either a pullback
    or sideways consolidation. The downside risk is the 50 day moving average (dma)
    and the gap that was created when the market rallied on March 9, 2018.'
