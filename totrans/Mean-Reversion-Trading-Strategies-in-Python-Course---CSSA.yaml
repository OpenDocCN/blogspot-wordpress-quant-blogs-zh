    I interviewed Dr. Ernest Chan who is the author of the [Mean-Reversion Trading
    Strategies in Python Course](https://quantra.quantinsti.com/course/python-mean-reversion-strategies-ernest-chan?utm_source=david_varadi&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=CSSA)
    that I will be reviewing in this post. **Readers interested in enrolling in the

- en: A long time ago when I first started trading using quantitative methods, I tried
    implementing statistical arbitrage strategies with a friend of mine using only
    an Excel notebook with a data feed. While I had a reasonable understanding of
    what to do, I didn’t have either the technical knowledge, practical experience,
    or programming/operational skills to do things properly. While the backtests look
    great, real-life trading made them look like a mirage in an oasis. Not surprisingly,
    this “half-assed” operation was a failure. If only I could have gone back in time
    and taken this course I probably would have had a much better chance of succeeding.
    The course teaches you both beginner and advanced stat arb techniques and shows
    you how to work with Python code and connect directly to Interactive Brokers.

    economist discussing arbitrage opportunities on paper or the classroom chalkboard,
    he is an actual hedge fund manager with a successful track record. As a result
    the course incorporates all the important reality-checks; from the obvious such
    as transaction costs, to the often overlooked such as considering short-selling
    availability and borrow costs, to the arcane such as importance of having non-negative
    weights in index arbitrage to avoid added exposure via stock specific risk. **In
    my opinion this is why quants should strongly consider taking courses on Quantra/QuantInsti
    if they want to at the very least avoid beginner mistakes that cost a lot more
    money than the cost of taking a course.**

    trading strategy. Various statistical tests such as the Augmented-Dickey-Fuller
    (ADF) test are presented along with both the requisite mathematics as well as
    code for calculation in Python. Then basic mean-reversion strategies are presented
    such as those that use Bollinger Bands or Z-scores that can be applied to stationary
    time series. This is extended to creating an actual portfolio of positions and
    how to manage this using signals to also calculating P/L. I liked the fact that
    an explanation was provided for why you would use statistical tests for stationarity
    prior to testing trading strategies since the majority of traders move immediately
    to backtesting.

    shows how to use the eigenvectors calculated for a wide variety of applications.
    The cool stuff included how to run arbitrage for triplets (3 stocks at a time)
    to basket arbitrage. Half-life calculations and their applications was also an
    important part of the content (this is often explained poorly by many sources
    but not in this case). I liked that the course covered risk management and also
    how to deal with broken pairs- something that everyone needs to know. Guidance
    was also provided for the best markets for pair trading. The course concludes
    with cross-sectional mean-reversion strategies which have been covered a lot on
    this blog. Python code for everything is covered in this course as well as how
    to apply turnkey approaches immediately in Interactive Brokers.

- en: Overall if you are looking to get into stat arb whether at the firm level or
    for yourself this is a great primer. While it doesn’t show you any secret sauce,
    it gives you all the technical and practical coding knowledge as a foundation
    to developing your own. So if you are already very experienced this course probably
    isn’t for you. But if you are experienced but lacking in the technical/practical
    side you should definitely consider taking the course. There is also a Quantra
    community to help answer questions and build networks. Hats off to Dr. Chan and
    the very talented team at Quantra/QuantInsti for putting this course together.
