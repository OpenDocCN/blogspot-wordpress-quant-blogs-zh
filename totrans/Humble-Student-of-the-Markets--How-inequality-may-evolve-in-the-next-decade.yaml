    U.S. reshoring, conditions on the ground are not always so favorable. That's because
    40 years of offshoring have done a lot of damage to what Gary Pisano and Willy
    Shih have called the nation's "[industrial commons](http://hbr.org/2009/07/restoring-american-competitiveness/ar/1)"—the
    shared resource base of skilled workers and supply chains upon which all manufacturers

    both GE and Google’s Motorola Mobility unit faced enormous difficulties in hiring
    adequate numbers of appropriately skilled people for their factories. Appliance
    Park started with 10,000 applications for an initial 2012 posting. Of the 6,100
    who passed the screening, 730 were hired but 228 were terminated in the first
    year. Fort Worth had to hire 6,500 workers to yield the required 2,500 employees
    to begin volume production. In both cases, a lack of basic familiarity with modern
    precision manufacturing among new hires led to a lot of turnover.

    local supply bases. Almost all the parts for the MotoX had to come from China,
    Korea or elsewhere in Asia, while GE encountered reduced capacity in its supply
    base for appliance parts. As of now, Appliance Park has basically succeeded in
    Louisville (though GE has signaled that it wants to sell its appliance division)
    while the Motorola—which Google is selling—said recently it will close the MotoX
    facility in Fort Worth due to lackluster sales and high costs for labor and shipping.

    economic inequality and growth—**places that begin with a lower level of inequality
    subsequently tend to grow faster and have longer periods of growth than those
    with a higher level of inequality**. In future research, we will focus on the
