    will depend on the Fed. In order to analyze what the Fed is likely to do, let`s

    path towards interest rate normalization. Therefore it would be unsurprising to
    see the FOMC statement take a more hawkish turn. Expect the post-meeting buzz
    to focus on one or two rate hikes for the remainder of 2016.
