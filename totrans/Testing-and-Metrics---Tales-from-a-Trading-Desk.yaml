    build and deploy chain tooling, GitHub and tutorials and samples available on
    the web. In many cases it is possible to find code lying around the web which
    may solves part of the problem you are attempting to code. That said, writing
    good code is an art. Code that is well structured, tested, and that delivers a
    solution to the problem statement is continues to be a high bar.

- en: Any testing is better than no testing; and in most cases, an individual’s viewpoint
    on testing is strongly influenced by their notion of what makes a quality product,
    and how quality is measured. Improving upon a viewpoint, however well informed,
    requires articulated hypothesis and data points of validation found in collected
    [metrics](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/237326).

- en: AWS’s recent blog posting on the [roulette](http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-web-services-uses-the-wheel-to-run-big-meetings-2017-12)
    wheel reminds us of how a data-driven culture is driving productivity and innovation
    at Amazon. Amazon has embraced metrics in defining objectives, and ensuring that
    products, services and processes meet expectation and can be optimised without
    reliance on “point of view”. Testing, backed by metrics, provides confidence that
    the delivered service will meet the expected criteria.

    in application code as it progresses through the Software Development Life Cycle
    (SDLC), indeed, in the case of Amazon, Metrics Driven Development (MDD) are at
    the core of the SDLC. Metrics that validate the Definition of [Done](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development))
    (of a story), not only validate software during test but provide real-time data-driven
    evidence of performance to specification in production.

    path of acceptance criteria/tests, as a required part of a story, risk failing
    to codify the story in a way that evidences how the requirement has been satisfied.'
