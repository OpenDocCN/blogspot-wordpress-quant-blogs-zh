    day historical volatility in the SPX up to levels not seen since December. While
    very few investors are convinced that last week’s bottom is now safe, there is
    a growing sense that the markets may have backed far away enough from the precipice
    for everyone to be able to take a few deep breaths.

    – and the VIX falling 10.7% on yesterday’s rally.

    with [historical volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/historical%20volatility),
    even though there is a high degree of correlation between the two.

- en: In my opinion, the reason why violent upside moves in the SPX tend to result
    in a lower VIX even in the face of rising volatility is due to several factors.
    As noted above, one of those factors is a smaller fear component of the VIX when
    markets are rising. Another important factor that depresses the VIX during a large
    jump in the SPX is the much smaller number of investors who rush to buy put protection
    without giving much concern to price. Finally, history demonstrates that for the
    most part, markets tend to fall more sharply than they rise, so statistical measures
    of volatility are likely to show greater volatility when the SPX is making a large
    move down than when it is moving up sharply.

    from Monday’s close to yesterday’s close. As usual, the biggest drop in the VIX
    is in the front months with the two front months show volatility dropping about
    10%. On the other hand SPX options 15 months out shows volatility dropping 6.4%,
    a relatively high ratio when compared to the front months. I submit that the distant
    months are reflecting not just a change in short-term concerns, but a sense that
    [structural volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/structural%20volatility)
    and systemic risk are much less of an issue at the present time than had previously
    been believed.
