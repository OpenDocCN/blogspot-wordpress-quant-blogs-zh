    inconvenient times.  For some, this means a 4% sell off just when you decided
    to margin some high flying internet stocks.  For me, this means having a birthday
    and attempting a birthday celebration on the day when the subject of your blog
    makes an unprecedented 64% move.  Yesterday someone asked me what I wanted for
    my birthday and I almost blurted out “A 20% spike in the VIX, of course,” but
    I bit my tongue and said something much less memorable.  There’s a lesson in there
    somewhere.

    [63,000 April 11 VIX puts](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/02/vix-march-otm-calls.html).  Heck,
    here in <place st="on">Northern California</place>, you can get a fairly decent
    condo for what he (or she) just threw away.

    so since the markets have closed.  I will do my best in the next hour or two to
    make some sense out of the debris left behind from today''s seismic shock and
    post some thoughts here later.  In the interim, readers looking to get a sense
    of my thought process might want to check out some of the following archived but
    relevant posts (as an aside, I too am not a fan of bands that make a live album
    or greatest hits collection after only one record or two, but that won’t stop
    me from doing essentially the same thing):'
