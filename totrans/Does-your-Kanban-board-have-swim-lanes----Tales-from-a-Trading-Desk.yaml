- en: It may sound either an odd question, or a sensible question depending on your
    kanban board today, but a lot of people seem to ignore the [swim](https://www.breeze.pm/blog/102-better-task-management-with-swimlanes)
    lane benefits, and just go with the column standard kanban board.

- en: Given kanban is lean, if your using an electronic board as a lot of us are these
    days, its probably worth playing with a few of the options in your chosen kanban
    product to see if you can gain further agility though surfacing of cards.  Swim
    lanes can clearly call out the progress within work stream or features within
    the application delivery that previously were hidden within the column order.

    in clarity of the micro/macro picture e.g usage of tags on the card.  More interestingly
    tracking staleness per column, which could aid in understanding flow and WIP.
