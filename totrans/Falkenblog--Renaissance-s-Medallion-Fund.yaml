- en: on James Simon's Medallion fund, which has averaged a 45% return since its inception
    in 1988\. Truly amazing. No one really knows how they do it, but it is rumored
    to employ some sort of quasi-market making, 'pairs-like' algorithm. That is, they
    trade a lot electronically, seeding the book and provididing liquidity (eg, limit
    orders to buy at the best bid or lower), and looking for abnormal movements with
    sympathetic stocks (eg, when IBM goes up, but Dell does not, sell IBM). This would
    explain why they are not really scalable ($10B Medallion has been closed to new
    investors for a long time).

    in Math, computer science, etc. This could be a slam on economists, in that we
    aren't as bright as these guys, or it could be our framework has been poisened
    by modern econometrics. However, it could be economist's are savvy enough to see
    the essence of the alpha, and so would be a bigger threat via leaving and starting
    a competitor, whereas the math PhDs are too focused on the little issues to grasp
    the bigger picture.

    would suggest their alpha is merely being the fastest electronic market makers
    in the world. Someone has to be fastest. Considering the new co-CEOs are both
    computer scientists, that would make sense.

    to make money off longer term strategies in futures and equities. These have not
    even outperformed the benchmarks, let alone displayed the amazing Medallion-type
    dominance. This highlights another reason to hide one's alpha, among the many
    (read Finding Alpha for more!). If your firm is in industry X, and makes money
    doing something very parochial within X, don't be too specific. This way, when
    you extend your brand, no one thinks twice about the plausibility that their new
    venture is totally different, and so customers are willing to give it a shot.
    It's possible Renaissance's alpha is in subtle price change correlations, a skill
    that would translate to other
