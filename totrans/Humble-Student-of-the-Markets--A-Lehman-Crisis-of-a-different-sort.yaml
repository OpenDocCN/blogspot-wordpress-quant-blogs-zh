    of the Great Financial Crisis that destabilized and almost brought down the global
    financial system.

    of 2008 was characterized by financial institutions unwilling to lend to each
    other and banking system liquidity seized up.

- en: Today’s version of the Lehman Crisis is characterized by countries and regions
    in lockdowns, and the propensity of individuals or groups to increase their social
    distance, either owing to quarantine, or by fear. This is leading to both supply
    and demand shocks. It is a supply shock because production and transportation
    are seizing up, which is leading to a collapse in global trade. Even before the
    onset of the COVID-19 outbreak, global trade had been weak. It is about to become
    even weaker.

    collapse in the demand for goods and services. As an example, France’s Finance
    Minister Bruno Le Maire told CNBC at the G-20 meeting that tourism had fallen
    30-40%.
