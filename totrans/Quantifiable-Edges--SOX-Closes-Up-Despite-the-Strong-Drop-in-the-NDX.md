# Quantifiable Edges: SOX Closes Up Despite the Strong Drop in the NDX

Two weeks ago

[I showed how a negative SOX on a day when the NDX is strong can suggest bearish implications](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2012/04/what-sox-is-suggesting-about-short-term.html)

for the short-term.

Last night Johan, a frequent reader, observed that the reverse had occurred (NDX down over 1% while SOX was up).  He wondered what the implications of that might be.  It stoked my curiosity as well.  So I took a look.

Moves higher have strongly outsized moves lower, but the consistency has not been great - just a little over 50/50\.  So I am not sure I would label this as "bullish", but it provides some hope for the bulls and is certainly better than the alternative we looked at a couple of weeks ago.
