    you knew nothing rings hollow, because with that much money flying around, people
    talk about how it was made ($3.5B in last 7 years doled out to those 400 employees).

    complex deals, which is supposedly why you are getting the big bonus.

    the house down. The plumber should still get paid. Not if they work for the same

    can't whine about government messing with the free market when he is getting a
    bail out. Further, the AIG contagion effect is based on a domino theory that I
    do not buy. If you take out a bookie, don't be scared by notional obligations
    because the cancel out.
