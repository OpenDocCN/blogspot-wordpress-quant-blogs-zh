    in a well-defined uptrend, but the NASDAQ 100 (NDX), which represents large-cap
    growth, violated an uptrend that stretches back to the GFC. The relative performance
    of the NASDAQ 100 to the S&P 500 shows a similar trend break that’s somewhat reminiscent
    of the Tech Bubble top of 2000\. Moreover, the recent relative performance of
    speculative growth stocks, as measured by ARK Investment ETF (ARKK), is similar
    to the post-2000 Bubble bust.
