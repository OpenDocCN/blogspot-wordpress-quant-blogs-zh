    that the market is doing something extraordinary. Indicators reaching excessive
    readings often suggest an edge because when things get too extreme, mean reversion
    tendencies tend to kick in.

- en: There are other instances where a small sample set simply suggests the market
    is not acting as it should. Monday’s action may be a good example of this. Gains
    of 3% - 4% that occurred on Friday were given up Monday in all indices on an intraday
    basis and most on an end of day basis. The S&P 500 rallied over 4% on Friday.
    After dipping below Thursday’s close late in the day Monday, it barely closed
    above it. I ran a test to find other times since 1975 that the market had gained
    at least 4% one day and then printed a low below the close of 2 days ago.

    close within 2 days. In fact, 5 of them managed to bounce the next day. The bounces
    did tend to die out after day 3\. So perhaps there’s a small upside edge based
    on this study, but that’s not the real takeaway.

- en: What’s significant here is that the market is acting in a way that it shouldn’t.
    It especially shouldn’t if it is planning on launching a great bull move. Look
    at some of the charts I’ve posted in the blog the last few days. Look at periods
    like March ‘03, July & October ’02, September ’01, September & October ’98, November
    ’97 and any other bottom you find. Massive one-day gains coming off lows simply
    don’t get wiped out the next day. It doesn’t happen. It happened Monday.

    incredibly simple system. Playing the chop has been working. Monday’s action suggests
    that despite last week’s bottom attempt, this hasn’t yet changed.
