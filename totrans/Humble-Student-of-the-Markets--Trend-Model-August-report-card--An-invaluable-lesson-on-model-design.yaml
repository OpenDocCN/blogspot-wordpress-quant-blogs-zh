    there is no substitute for actual performance. As a proof of concept, I started
    to manage a small account that traded long, inverse and leveraged ETFs on the
    major US market averages and, on occasion, sector and industry ETFs. Trading decisions
    were based on Trend Model signals combined with some short-term sentiment indicators.
    The inception date of the account was September 30, 2013, For more details on

    The "Main" model, which is a trend following model applied to global commodity
    and equity prices. The Main model worked well, but returns were subject to wild
    swings. I had warned about a possible correction in early February (see

    was to supplement the Main Model with a "Trading" model, which is composed of
    sentiment and overbought-oversold models to spot short-term counter-trend moves.
    The purpose of the combination is to prevent the Main model from getting into
    positions when the move is getting over-extended. Thus, the Trading model will
    prevent the overall model from buying when the market is overbought and shorting
    when the market is oversold.

    spotted the downtrend early, very early, but the Trading model prevented it from
    shorting the market because sentiment had moved to a crowded short and the market
    was mildly oversold (see

    as dictated by the Main model. Unfortunately, oversold markets can get more oversold

    2008, 2004, 2001, 1987, 1962 and 1940\. Only in 1940, when the market reacted
    to the Fall of France, did stock prices go even lower. It became evident to me
    that when statistics get thrown around comparing current conditions to the Lehman
    Crisis, the Crash of 1987 and the Fall of France that the market is seeing an
    extreme tail-event.

    what circumstances does the investment approach fail. This strategy will truly
    blow up with a -30% to -80% month when extreme tail events like the Fall of France
    happens. Under more "normal" circumstances, maximum monthly drawdown should be
    limited to around 10%. How worried should investors be about blow-up risk events
    that last happened 75 years ago? The return distribution chart below tells the
    story. There are really two nevdistributions at work here. The more "typical"
    monthly returns show a bell-shaped Gaussian return distribution centered at about
    2-4% a month, while the extreme tail-risk came in at -16%.

    return of 1.4% and a distribution that's slightly skewed to the right and tail-risk

    pattern below? As the chart below shows, the stock market has a median return
    of 0.9% per month, which is lower, and a skew that tilts to the left, or negative.
