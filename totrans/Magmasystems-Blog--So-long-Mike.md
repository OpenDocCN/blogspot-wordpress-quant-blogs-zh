# Magmasystems Blog: So long Mike

> 来源：[http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2006/11/so-long-mike.html#0001-01-01](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2006/11/so-long-mike.html#0001-01-01)

Our friend Mike was a 25-year veteran of the Financial Service practice of a very large consulting firm. He was just informed that he was to be dismissed, on the basis of not making his (unrealistic) sales quota. The new management of the division and Mike did not agree on things, and the easy way to get rid of a person is to set him up for failure.

Mike will easily find a new position, as he is known and respected in the financial services area. And, opportunity is also borne out of adversity.

Know the warning signs when you are being set up to fail. Miike saw them a mile away, and was prepared.
