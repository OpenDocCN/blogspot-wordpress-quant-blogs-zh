- en: 'Colin Lancaster’s Fed Up is a new addition to the literature on trading financial
    markets, promising the inside line on running a macro fund operating in the global
    markets during the Covid pandemic. Having worked as a sell side techie building
    trading systems for the last twenty years I’ve read a fair bit of this literature,
    from classics like Niederhoffer’s Education of a Speculator and Kindelberger’s
    Mania, Panics & Financial Crashes, to riotous shock fests like Belfort’s Wolf
    of Wall Street and Anderson’s Cityboy: Beer and Loathing in the Square Mile. For
    me the real standouts manage to combine market history, financial mechanics exegesis,
    storytelling and amusing anecdotage. The best example is Michael Lewis’ Liars
    Poker. Partnoy’s FIASCO and Das’ Traders, Guns and Money are commendable as well.
    So how does Lancaster’s effort stack up against the canon?'

- en: Lancaster plays it slightly differently as he presents a thinly novelized account
    of his experiences, rather than memoir or narratized tutorial. Because he presents
    his account as a novel I will mark him down on a couple of points later, but firstly
    I must recognize his major achievement with this book. Lancaster succeeds in his
    dramatic reconstruction of the flow of political and economic events week by week
    since Q1 2020\. The lightening quick market reversals, central bank interventions,
    major political developments, and their impact on a fund manager and his team
    are described with gripping momentum, and rendered in such convincing detail that
    I could almost see the teeth grinding desk thumping traders hunched over their
    Bloombergs.

- en: A novelized treatment gives Lancaster the scope to wander, so along the way
    we take in a lot of enjoyable pop cultural references. Amy Winehouse, Led Zep,
    the Stones, Guns’n’Roses, U2 and Freddie Mercury all get mentions. Even Dr John,
    and that’s one for the real musos! There’s even time for a Hunter S Thompson quote.
    Fiction also enables Lancaster to lecture his readers on pet economic and political
    topics. He uses the literary device of mentoring a junior to deliver set pieces
    on twentieth century fiscal policy, and the dislocation of quantitative easing
    as the “new normal”. Personally I found mentions of Clinton as the last President
    to balance the US budget, and the Reinhard-Rogoff paper on government debt to
    GDP ratios gratifying. Especially as the latter was used by Cameron and Osborne
    to justify austerity.

- en: 'So where does Fed Up fall down? If you come looking for detailed explanation
    of the kind presented in Zuckerman’s Greatest Trade, you’ll be disappointed. If
    you don’t know what yield curve inversion is, Lancaster’s not going to enlighten
    you. The presentation of the story as fiction causes some irritation: there’s
    an Amy Winehouse dream sequence that serves no apparent purpose. And the relationship
    of the principal with his wife is referenced intermittently, with hints that his
    neglect has induced her to have an affair, but then it’s all left unresolved.
    There’s also a slightly sanctimonious tone taken on drug using colleagues that
    makes me suspect the author doth protest too much. And finally a couple of minor
    typos and factual errors: there’s no company called HIS Markit – it’s “IHS Markit”,
    and Lancaster is wrong about the timing of the death of Brian Jones. If he’s as
    big a music fan as he seems he should have got that one right. But I do appreciate
    his story about a team outing to the hotel bar where the Stones launched Beggars
    Banquet back in 68\. That was new to me!'

  zh: Fed Up 的不足之处在哪里呢？如果你期望得到类似于 Zuckerman’s Greatest Trade 中所呈现的详细解释，那么你会感到失望。如果你不知道收益率曲线倒挂是什么，Lancaster
    不会给你启发。将故事呈现为虚构的形式引起了一些不快：有一个艾米·怀恩豪斯的梦境场景，看起来毫无意义。而主人公与妻子的关系则断断续续地提及，暗示着他的忽视导致了她的出轨，但后来一切都没有得到解决。还有一种对服用药物的同事持有的略带假正经的态度让我怀疑作者是否有些过于较真了。最后还有一些小小的拼写错误和事实错误：没有一家公司叫做
    HIS Markit - 它是 “IHS Markit”，而且 Lancaster 关于 Brian Jones 死亡时间的说法是错误的。如果他真的是个像他看起来那样的音乐迷，那么他应该记得这一点。但我很欣赏他关于一个团队外出到酒店酒吧的故事，那是
    68 年滚石乐队推出《Beggars Banquet》的地方。这对我来说是新的！
- en: In conclusion, I think I’ll rate this as 3/5\. Don’t pick this one up if you
    haven’t read Liars Poker. But if you are familiar with the classics you’ll find
    it thought provoking, entertaining and enjoyable.

  zh: 总的来说，我认为我会给这本书打 3/5 分。如果你还没有读过《骗子扑克》，那就不要选择这本书。但如果你熟悉这些经典作品，你会发现它发人深思、娱乐和令人愉快。
