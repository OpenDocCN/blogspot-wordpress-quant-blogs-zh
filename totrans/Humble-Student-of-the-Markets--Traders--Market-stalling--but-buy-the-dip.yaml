- en: In the short-term, the market is flashing cautionary signals for traders. The
    SPX is exhibiting negative RSI divergences as it broke out to new recovery highs.
    As well, the VIX Index breached its lower Bollinger Band for two consecutive days,
    indicating an overbought market. Historically, such conditions have led to market
    weakness lasting 2-4 trading days. If history is any guide, a short-term trading
    bottom is most likely to occur either Friday or Monday.
