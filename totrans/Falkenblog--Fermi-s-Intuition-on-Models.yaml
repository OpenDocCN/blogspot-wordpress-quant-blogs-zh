- en: video snippet, Freeman Dyson talks about an experience he had with Enrico Fermi
    in 1951\. Dyson was originally a mathematician who had just shown how two different
    formulations of quantum electrodynamics (QED), Feynman diagrams and Schwinger-Tomonoga's
    operator method, were equivalent. Fermi was a great experimental and theoretical
    physicist who built the first nuclear reactor and discovered things like neutrinos,
    pions, and muons.

- en: 'Dyson and a team at Cornell were working on a model of strong interactions,
    the forces that bind protons and neutrons in the nucleus. Their theory had a speculative
    physical basis: a nucleon field and a pseudo-scalar meson field (the pion field),
    which interacted with the proton. Their approach was to use the same tricks Dyson
    used on QED. After a year and a half, they produced a model that generated a nice
    agreement with Fermi''s empirical work on meson-proton scattering he had produced
    at his cyclotron in Chicago.'

    how his theoretical calculations matched Fermi's data. Fermi hardly looked at
    the graphs, and said,

- en: I'm not very impressed with what you've been doing. When one does a theoretical
    calculation there are two ways of doing it. Either you should have a clear physical
    model in mind, or you should have a rigorous mathematical basis. You have neither.

- en: Dyson asked about the numerical agreement between his model and the empirical
    data. Fermi then responded, 'how many free parameters did you use for the fitting?' 
    Dyson noted there were four. Fermi responded, 'Johnny von Neumann always used
    to say with four parameters I can fit an elephant, with five I can make him wiggle
    his trunk. So I don't find the numerical agreement very impressive.'

- en: I love this because it highlights a good way of looking at models. A handful
    of free parameters can make any model fit the data, generating the same result
    as a miracle step in a logical argument.  Either you derive a model from something
    you know to be true, or you derive them from a theory with a clear intuitive causal
    mechanism.

- en: The entire interaction took only 15 minutes and was very disappointing, but
    Dyson was blessed with the wisdom and humility to take Fermi's dismissal as definitive
    and went back to Cornell to tell the team they should just write up what they
    had done and move on to different projects.

- en: While this was crushing, with hindsight Dyson was grateful to Fermi. It saved
    his team from wasting years on a project that he discovered later would have never
    worked. There is no 'pseudo-scalar pion field.'  Eventually, physicists replaced
    the pion with 2 quarks, of which there are 6, highlighting the futility of the
    physical basis of their approach. Any experimental agreement they found was illusory.

  zh: 虽然这让人沮丧，但事后戴森对费米心存感激。这挽救了他的团队，避免了在一个后来他发现根本行不通的项目上浪费数年时间。这里没有'伪标量π介子场'。最终，物理学家用2个夸克取代了π介子，而夸克有6个，凸显了他们方法的物理基础的无用。他们所发现的任何实验结果都是虚幻的。
- en: After this experience, Dyson realized he was best suited to simplify models
    or connecting axioms to applications like quantum field theory. What was required
    for the strong interactions at that time was not a deductive solution but an invention--in
    this case, quarks--and that requires strong intuition. He realized his strengths
    were more analytic, less intuitive.

  zh: 在这次经历后，戴森意识到他更适合简化模型或将公理连接到量子场论等应用。那时强相互作用所需的不是演绎解决方案，而是一种发明--在这种情况下，是夸克--而且那需要强烈的直觉。他意识到他的优势更多地是分析性的，而不太是直觉性的。
- en: Unfortunately, today our best scientists are unconcerned about the ability of
    free parameters to make a bad theory seem fruitful. In physics, we have inflation,
    dark matter, and dark energy, things that never been isolated or fit into the
    Standard Model. In climate science, an anachronistic and clearly wrong Keynesian
    macro-model is one of many components (e.g., atmospheric, ocean, vegetation).
    They fit known data well but are totally unfalsifiable.

  zh: 不幸的是，如今我们最好的科学家们对自由参数使一种糟糕的理论看起来富有成果毫不在意。 在物理学中，我们有膨胀，暗物质和暗能量，这些东西从未被分离或符合标准模型。在气候科学中，一个过时且显然错误的凯恩斯宏观模型是许多组成部分之一（例如，大气，海洋，植被）。它们很好地符合已知数据，但完全无法证伪。
