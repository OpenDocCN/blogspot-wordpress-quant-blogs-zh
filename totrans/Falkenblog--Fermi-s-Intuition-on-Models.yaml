- en: video snippet, Freeman Dyson talks about an experience he had with Enrico Fermi
    in 1951\. Dyson was originally a mathematician who had just shown how two different
    formulations of quantum electrodynamics (QED), Feynman diagrams and Schwinger-Tomonoga's
    operator method, were equivalent. Fermi was a great experimental and theoretical
    physicist who built the first nuclear reactor and discovered things like neutrinos,
    pions, and muons.

  zh: 视频片段，弗里曼·迪森谈论了他1951年与恩里科·费米的经历。迪森最初是一位数学家，他刚刚证明了量子电动力学（QED）的两种不同表述，费曼图和施温格-托莫诺加的算子方法是等价的。费米是一位伟大的实验和理论物理学家，他建造了第一个核反应堆，并发现了中微子、介子和μ介子等东西。
- en: 'Dyson and a team at Cornell were working on a model of strong interactions,
    the forces that bind protons and neutrons in the nucleus. Their theory had a speculative
    physical basis: a nucleon field and a pseudo-scalar meson field (the pion field),
    which interacted with the proton. Their approach was to use the same tricks Dyson
    used on QED. After a year and a half, they produced a model that generated a nice
    agreement with Fermi''s empirical work on meson-proton scattering he had produced
    at his cyclotron in Chicago.'

  zh: 迪森和康奈尔大学的一个团队正致力于研究强相互作用的模型，这种力量将质子和中子束缚在原子核中。他们的理论有一种具有推测性质的物理基础：核子场和伪标量介子场（π介子场），它与质子相互作用。他们的方法是利用迪森在量子电动力学上应用的技巧。经过一年半时间，他们产生了一个模型，与费米在芝加哥自己的回旋加速器上对介子-质子散射的经验工作产生了良好的一致性。
- en: Dyson went to Chicago to explain his theory to Fermi and presented a graph showing
    how his theoretical calculations matched Fermi's data. Fermi hardly looked at
    the graphs, and said,

  zh: 迪森去芝加哥向费米解释他的理论，并呈现了一张展示他的理论计算与费米数据匹配情况的图表。费米几乎没有看这些图表，然后说，
- en: I'm not very impressed with what you've been doing. When one does a theoretical
    calculation there are two ways of doing it. Either you should have a clear physical
    model in mind, or you should have a rigorous mathematical basis. You have neither.

  zh: 我对你一直在做的事情并不十分印象深刻。做理论计算有两种方法。要么你应该心里清楚地有一个物理模型，要么你应该有严格的数学基础。你两者都没有。
- en: Dyson asked about the numerical agreement between his model and the empirical
    data. Fermi then responded, 'how many free parameters did you use for the fitting?' 
    Dyson noted there were four. Fermi responded, 'Johnny von Neumann always used
    to say with four parameters I can fit an elephant, with five I can make him wiggle
    his trunk. So I don't find the numerical agreement very impressive.'

  zh: 迪森询问他的模型与经验数据的数值一致性。费米回答说，'你用了多少个自由参数进行拟合？'迪森说有四个。费米回答说，'约翰·冯·诺伊曼曾经说过用四个参数我可以拟合一头大象，用五个我可以让它摆动鼻子。所以我并不觉得数值上的一致性有多印象深刻。'

- en: I love this because it highlights a good way of looking at models. A handful
    of free parameters can make any model fit the data, generating the same result
    as a miracle step in a logical argument.  Either you derive a model from something
    you know to be true, or you derive them from a theory with a clear intuitive causal
    mechanism.

  zh: 我爱这个故事，因为它突出了看待模型的一个好方法。少数的自由参数能使任何模型符合数据，产生与逻辑论证中的奇迹步骤相同的结果。要么你从一个你知道正确的东西推导出模型，要么你从一个具有清晰直观因果机制的理论中推导出它们。
- en: The entire interaction took only 15 minutes and was very disappointing, but
    Dyson was blessed with the wisdom and humility to take Fermi's dismissal as definitive
    and went back to Cornell to tell the team they should just write up what they
    had done and move on to different projects.

  zh: 整个互动只持续了15分钟，而且令人失望，但戴森有智慧和谦逊，将费米的拒绝视为定论，然后回到康奈尔大学告诉团队他们应该把他们所做的工作写下来，然后继续进行不同的项目。
- en: While this was crushing, with hindsight Dyson was grateful to Fermi. It saved
    his team from wasting years on a project that he discovered later would have never
    worked. There is no 'pseudo-scalar pion field.'  Eventually, physicists replaced
    the pion with 2 quarks, of which there are 6, highlighting the futility of the
    physical basis of their approach. Any experimental agreement they found was illusory.

  zh: 虽然这让人沮丧，但事后戴森对费米心存感激。这挽救了他的团队，避免了在一个后来他发现根本行不通的项目上浪费数年时间。这里没有'伪标量π介子场'。最终，物理学家用2个夸克取代了π介子，而夸克有6个，凸显了他们方法的物理基础的无用。他们所发现的任何实验结果都是虚幻的。
- en: After this experience, Dyson realized he was best suited to simplify models
    or connecting axioms to applications like quantum field theory. What was required
    for the strong interactions at that time was not a deductive solution but an invention--in
    this case, quarks--and that requires strong intuition. He realized his strengths
    were more analytic, less intuitive.

  zh: 在这次经历后，戴森意识到他更适合简化模型或将公理连接到量子场论等应用。那时强相互作用所需的不是演绎解决方案，而是一种发明--在这种情况下，是夸克--而且那需要强烈的直觉。他意识到他的优势更多地是分析性的，而不太是直觉性的。
- en: Unfortunately, today our best scientists are unconcerned about the ability of
    free parameters to make a bad theory seem fruitful. In physics, we have inflation,
    dark matter, and dark energy, things that never been isolated or fit into the
    Standard Model. In climate science, an anachronistic and clearly wrong Keynesian
    macro-model is one of many components (e.g., atmospheric, ocean, vegetation).
    They fit known data well but are totally unfalsifiable.

  zh: 不幸的是，如今我们最好的科学家们对自由参数使一种糟糕的理论看起来富有成果毫不在意。 在物理学中，我们有膨胀，暗物质和暗能量，这些东西从未被分离或符合标准模型。在气候科学中，一个过时且显然错误的凯恩斯宏观模型是许多组成部分之一（例如，大气，海洋，植被）。它们很好地符合已知数据，但完全无法证伪。
