    as a neat new way to compress a ton of economic data to gauge the health of the
    economy in order to predict cyclical (not sentiment driven) drawdowns in the stock
    market. The current prediction uses two different models:'

- en: 1) **Composite Point-in-time**– this model only creates a forecast when all
    data required by the model is available at the point-in-time that it was available.
    If the model is waiting on data it will simply carry forward the last prediction
    made when all data was available. The [historical prediction table](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2019/05/15/current-sp500-economic-forecasting-model-introduction/)
    was generated using this model.

- en: 2) **Preliminary** – this model is trained using the data available and is capable
    of making forecasts when there is missing data that the Composite model is waiting
    for. It does this by interpolating the missing data. Currently given that there
    are three missing pieces of data we can only make a preliminary forecast through
    the end of June.
