    investors did more selling than buying, pushing the VIX up 3.45 points (17.6%)
    to 23.01 by the end of the week and marking the highest close in the VIX in seven
    weeks.

    with [Citigroup (C)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=c) and [Merrill Lynch
    (MER)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=mer) causing most of the consternation.  For
    a superb summary of the week that was and the week that might lie ahead, I highly
    recommend reading up on what Barry Ritholtz at [The Big Picture](http://bigpicture.typepad.com/)
    has assembled (I think I’ll make these links a regular feature of my weekly VWSI
    update):'

- en: Turning to the VWSI, the increased volatility helped to push the dial to a VWSI
    of -3 by the end of the week.  The last time the VWSI closed the week at -3 was
    back in the first week of 2007, when the ‘spike’ to 12.14 initially looked like
    an aberration, as the next seven weeks saw the VIX close in the 10s and low 11s.  Of
    course, everything hit the fan on February 27^(th) and it has been a different
    investing environment ever since.  I have no reason to predict that the current
    -3 reading may come at a similar juncture, but it is always instructive to look
    back at recent history and try to imagine how the current market lens differs
    from the already outdated one.

- en: '*****Wine pairing:***  For a VWSI of -3, I suggest a versatile light red wine.  No,
    not a [Beaujolais](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaujolais) (even though another
    [Beaujolais nouveau](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaujolais_nouveau) release
    date is soon approaching) or the [gamay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamay) grape
    behind the wine.  No, not a [pinot noir](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/pinot%20noir)
    either.  Instead, I recommend something old and something new: a [barbera](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbera).  This
    grape is widely planted in <country-region st="on">Italy</country-region> and
    is used frequently as a blending grape, both in <country-region st="on">Italy</country-region>
    and in the <country-region st="on"><place st="on">United States</place></country-region>.'

    certainly produces the best know barberas, [Barbera d’Asti](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbera_d%27Asti)
    and Barbera d’Alba, it is fruity, highly drinkable version of this wine from the
    [Sierra Foothills](http://www.foothillwine.com/) that recently tickled my fancy:
    the 2005 [Renwood](http://www.renwood.com/) Sierra Series Barbera.  If you are
    looking for a different varietal to add to your list of everyday reds, seek this
    one out.  For only $9 at my local wine store, it’s a bargain and a great change
    of pace.'
