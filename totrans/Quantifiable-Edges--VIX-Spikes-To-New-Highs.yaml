- en: It is notable that the VIX spiked up 16% on Monday and closed at the highest
    level since June.  In the past when it has closed at a high level on a strong
    move there has been a tendency for the SPX to bounce over the next few days. This
    can be seen in the study below from the 5/15/12 blog.  (Stats are updated.)

    worth consideration.
