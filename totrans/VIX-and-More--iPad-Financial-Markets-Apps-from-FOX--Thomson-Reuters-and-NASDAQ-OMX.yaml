    I began with the free apps, which include the high quality [CNBC Real-Time for
    the iPad](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2011/04/cnbc-real-time-for-ipad.html)
    and runner up, [Bloomberg for iPad](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bloomberg-for-ipad/id364304764?mt=8)
    – both of which I reviewed earlier this month.

- en: A second tier (perhaps too harsh of a characterization) of free apps in the
    same broad-based financial markets space that I experimented with include one
    app from FOX, two from Thomson Reuters and a more specialized app from the NASDAQ
    OMX.

- en: My favorite of these near misses is [FOX Business for iPad](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fox-business-for-ipad/id384159739?mt=8),
    which is similar to the CNBC and Bloomberg apps in that its focus is on news,
    video content and market data. The site is attractively organized, has a large
    amount of up-to-date video content, includes a portfolio tracker function and
    a FOX Business Minute button which enables users to quickly scan the day’s headlines
    and link to related video. In sum, the feature-filled FOX app is a strong competitor
    to CNBC and Bloomberg and will probably be preferred by some to its two main competitors.
    In the end I am counting it as a near miss because of some content organization
    and graphics issues. I was also disappointed that FOX Business for iPad did not
    have the [XIV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TVIX) ETF in its database
    and was therefore unable to add it to my portfolio.

- en: The two Thomson Reuters products struck me as slightly too news and text-centric
    for my taste. My favorite of the two is [Reuters News Pro for iPad](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reuters-news-pro-for-ipad/id363274833?mt=8),
    which has a strong global focus in terms of financial and non-financial news.
    It also puts more emphasis on global markets and currencies than the competition.
    While this app lacks a formal portfolio management function, it does have an attractive
    portfolio monitoring module, Stocks, that makes it easy to track various holdings
    in terms of news and performance, along with charts. For the international investor,
    I can certainly see where News Pro might supplement or in some cases even win
    out over the more U.S.-centric CNBC, Bloomberg and FOX apps. I am still not sure
    exactly which audience the [Thomson Reuters Marketboard](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/thomson-reuters-marketboard/id363999272?mt=8)
    app is targeting, though it looks as if this app attempts to leverage and extend
    the functionality and data available to Thomson ONE account holders. In some respects
    the app strikes me as a potential companion to News Pro. Again there is a strong
    global data to the content, but the emphasis is more on headlines and snapshots
    than detailed content. If you are interested in research, company reports and
    corporate events – and particularly if you are an existing Thomson ONE subscriber
    – Marketboard should have a good deal of appeal.

    of my list was [QFolio HD – the NASDAQ OMX Portfolio Manager](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/qfolio-hd-nasdaq-omx-portfolio/id364265462?mt=8).
    While apps from individual brokers are great for tracking broker-specific holdings,
    the functionality I have yet to find is one that deftly aggregates portfolio information
    across multiple brokers and asset classes. Unfortunately QFolio did not live up
    to my expectations, though not for lack of trying.

- en: 'There are three main screens for QFolio: Portfolio; Company Details; and Market
    Mind. The Portfolio screen includes aggregated portfolio information with total
    portfolio value. I was disappointed by the fact that the overview screen only
    has sufficient real estate to display four holdings on one screen at a glance.
    While scrolling affords quick access to the full list of holdings, it would be
    nice to have more holdings and less information available on one screen, ideally
    with this information customizable by the user. The graphic below is a snapshot
    *[with fictitious portfolio data -Ed]* of the Company Details data display, which
    includes links to a StockTwits feed as well as a StockTwits TV video feed. Last
    but not least is the Market Mind feature, which turns out to be the best way to
    monitor changes in prices for five or more holdings at a time. Here one can monitor
    prices, view intraday charts and even view time and sales data. While the current
    incarnation of QFolio is certainly an adequate portfolio management tool, it has
    the potential to be even more. I look forward to seeing how this app evolves over
    time.'
