- en: December was an extremely quiet month for trade ideas. There were only 7 trade
    ideas closed during the Month. April and July both had 13 trade ideas closed,
    which was the previous low. This was due to a few reasons.

- en: First, there were several trade ideas that didn’t receive fills. This was primarily
    due to the market gapping in our direction and not providing an entry opportunity.

- en: Another reason for the low number of “official” trade ideas was the fact that
    no Catapults triggered. Catapults were plentiful in October and November. Typically
    2-3 times each year there will be a decent sized cluster of catapult trades for
    traders to try and take advantage of.

- en: Lastly, the action itself in December was extremely choppy. The S&P didn’t close
    in the same direction 3 days in a row at all in December. Several of the strategies
    are mean-reverting and mean-reverting strategies don’t trigger when you don’t
    get far from the mean.

- en: '*I don’t suggest position sizes. The primary reason for this is I’m not acting
    as a financial advisor. I don’t feel it is appropriate to suggest allocation sizes
    without understanding someone’s financial situation and risk tolerance. Even for
    my own trading I run different portfolios with different levels of aggressiveness.
    For instance, my most aggressive portfolio is my IRA. Here I may use options to
    sometimes get 400-500% leveraged. Other portfolios on the other hand normally
    take much more conservative stances and some rarely reach or exceed 100% exposure.'

- en: Since I don’t suggest position sizes this is should not be considered a performance
    report, but rather a trade idea scorecard. Therefore, no matter how objective
    I try to be the reporting of the results is always going to be skewed depending
    on how you approach the trades. For instance, I always recommend scaling into
    the Catapult positions in 3 parts, whereas the “System” trades (whatever system
    I unveil other than Catapult) are normally one entry. The “Index” trades I normally
    recommend scaling into as well. For my own trading I trade much larger size with
    the index trades than any of the individuals. I also control my exposure by limiting
    the total amount invested per day. As I mentioned, this will vary depending on
    the account I’m trading. My most aggressive account I may put in up to 100%/day
    and get heavily leveraged using options. A more conservative account may max out
    at 15%-20% per day.

    so personal results would vary greatly depending on the trader’s approach.*
