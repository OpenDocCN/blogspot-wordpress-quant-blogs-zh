- en: Ten months have passed since the [last time](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2011/01/now-sixteen-volatility-etps-four-of.html)
    I attempted to graphically depict all the [VIX-based exchange-traded products](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20ETN).
    At that time there were 16 such securities; now that number has swelled to 31
    and two have closed their doors ([IVO](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/IVO)
    and [VZZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/IVO)) along the way.

- en: The graphic below attempts to map the herd onto an x-axis for target duration
    and a y-axis for leverage. In addition to these important criteria, I have also
    further delineated the group by identifying the four ProShares ETFs in black (the
    balance are all ETNs), highlighting the five optionable ETPs with a red O preceding
    their ticker and flagging the two VIX ETPs that have some non-VIX components (in
    the form of the S&P 500 index) with a black triangle. For good measure I have
    identified the issuer with a parenthetical one letter abbreviation (**B**arclays,**V**elocityShares,
    **P**roShares and **U**BS).

- en: It is worth noting that earlier in the month S&P and VelocityShares [announced](http://velocityshares.com/news/SP500_VIX_Futures_11-3-11.pdf)
    several new VIX futures strategy indices that hint at future VIX ETPs, all of
    which will include both a long leg and a short (inverse) leg.

- en: The VIX ETP space is already an exciting one, with over $2.1 billion in assets
    and daily volume of over 45 million shares per day. As exciting as 2011 has been
    in this space, things look to be heating up even more in 2012.
