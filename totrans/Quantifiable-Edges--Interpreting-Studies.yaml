    lately. I thought today I would address a few comments I got regarding a post
    from Tuesday.

- en: In Tuesday’s post I showed a setup that suggested the market was likely to close
    higher on Wednesday than it did on Monday. This statement is based on the fact
    that all previous 16 instances did close higher 2 days later. I showed the results
    table for days 1-5 (Tues through next Mon). As sometimes happens when you deal
    in probabilities (and not certainties) the market did not adhere to historical
    norms and instead sold off. After it was clear that the SPX was not likely to
    finish higher on Wednesday I got a few comments from blog readers about the study.

    are still appealing from the bull side – even more so now that some short-term
    overbought conditions have been neutralized.”

    edge at the third day?” He noted that while there was a perfect record through
    2 days, day 3 showed a decent number of losers as well as a drop in total profits.

    evaluate a study or consider it useful. Both of these comments showed logical
    interpretations of the data. Now I’ll share my interpretation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When I look at a study like this I generally only track it as long as the results
    remain consistent. While I could have looked to follow it further, the real value
    in this study in my eyes was what occurred in the first 2 days. So regardless
    of whether it works out over day 1 and 2, after that I’m on to looking at my next
    group of studies. In this case it didn’t work out. Does this tell me anything?
    Assuming I don’t have a data mining issue with this study (unlikely in this case)
    then all I’ve really found out for sure is that the market is not reacting as
    it normally does to that particular setup. Again, let’s assume the setup does
    provide an edge and it will continue to be useful in the future. (Not always the
    case but an assumption that need to be made for this discussion.)

    went down. Does that mean it will continue to go down? Does that mean it is now
    oversold and will likely bounce in the next couple of days? Taken as 1 individual
    study it is impossible to determine.

    case it was strong consistent breadth. While I found this study to be the most
    interesting and “blogworthy” Tuesday morning, there was also a short-term bearish
    study that triggered Monday night which was published in the

- en: . Additionally, there were 3 other short-term bearish studies from the Sunday
    night letter that were also in effect. So it wasn’t terribly surprising that the
    market struggled Tuesday and Wednesday. And while the strong breadth was saying
    we were going higher, these other studies that looked at things such as the overbought
    price action and weak volume suggested a pullback was in order.

- en: So in this particular case, when the market didn’t react in the “normal” way
    to the setup studied in Tuesday’s blog, it didn’t concern me. On the other hand,
    if there were a large number of bullish studies, and few or no bearish studies
    and the market traded lower, then I might get concerned. If this abnormal behavior
    persisted then I would view risk as elevated and would consider adjusting my position
    size and trade management accordingly.

    on the blog each week, which I hope are often useful. But that is really all they
    are – useful tidbits. They are not market calls and when the market reacts the
    way it normally does, it doesn’t me I was right. And when the market moves opposite
    a study it doesn’t mean I was wrong. I do suggest trade ideas in my

    in determining my bias and in making index trades. My primary tool for interpreting
    all the studies is the Quantifiable Edges Aggregator. The Aggregator basically
    takes all of my currently “active” studies and uses them to make a projection
    for the next few days. If you would like to learn more about the Aggregator, then
    below are two links.

    ago. It includes a detailed overview of the Aggregator as well as a question and
    answer period from subscribers that posed some interesting questions. The video
    is about 40 minutes, so it takes some time to watch. I should also apologize for
    the lack of editing. I just started holding these webinars and I need to get up
    to speed with all the tools. It takes about 40 seconds before the presentation
    really gets going.
