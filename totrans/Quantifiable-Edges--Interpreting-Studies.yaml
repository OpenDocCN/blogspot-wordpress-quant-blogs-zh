  zh: 对于读者，我在此表示歉意，因为博客最近有点受到夏季沉闷的影响。我今天想回答一些关于周二帖子的一些评论。
- en: In Tuesday’s post I showed a setup that suggested the market was likely to close
    higher on Wednesday than it did on Monday. This statement is based on the fact
    that all previous 16 instances did close higher 2 days later. I showed the results
    table for days 1-5 (Tues through next Mon). As sometimes happens when you deal
    in probabilities (and not certainties) the market did not adhere to historical
    norms and instead sold off. After it was clear that the SPX was not likely to
    finish higher on Wednesday I got a few comments from blog readers about the study.

  zh: 在周二的帖子中，我展示了一个设置，表明市场很可能在周三收盘时比周一更高。这个说法是基于这样一个事实，即之前的16个实例都在两天后收盘更高。我展示了第1-5天（周二至下周一）的结果表。当你处理概率（而不是确定性）时，有时市场不会遵循历史常态，而是下跌。当很清楚标普500指数不太可能在周三收盘更高时，我收到了一些关于该研究的博客读者的评论。
- en: The first commenter, Daniel, noted that “the odds and ratios up to 5 days out
    are still appealing from the bull side – even more so now that some short-term
    overbought conditions have been neutralized.”

- en: The 2nd commenter, 24/5 Trader, remarked, “Isn’t this study showing a bearish
    edge at the third day?” He noted that while there was a perfect record through
    2 days, day 3 showed a decent number of losers as well as a drop in total profits.

    evaluate a study or consider it useful. Both of these comments showed logical
    interpretations of the data. Now I’ll share my interpretation.

- en: When I look at a study like this I generally only track it as long as the results
    remain consistent. While I could have looked to follow it further, the real value
    in this study in my eyes was what occurred in the first 2 days. So regardless
    of whether it works out over day 1 and 2, after that I’m on to looking at my next
    group of studies. In this case it didn’t work out. Does this tell me anything?
    Assuming I don’t have a data mining issue with this study (unlikely in this case)
    then all I’ve really found out for sure is that the market is not reacting as
    it normally does to that particular setup. Again, let’s assume the setup does
    provide an edge and it will continue to be useful in the future. (Not always the
    case but an assumption that need to be made for this discussion.)

  zh: 当我查看这类研究时，我通常只跟踪结果在保持一致的情况。虽然我本可以进一步关注它，但在我看来，这个研究真正的价值在于前两天发生的事情。所以无论它在第1天和第2天是否有效，之后我就会开始关注我的下一组研究。在这个案例中，它没有奏效。这告诉我什么？假设我没有在这个研究上遇到数据挖掘问题（在这个案例中可能性不大），那么我真正确定的是，市场没有像往常那样对这种特定的设置做出反应。再次，假设这个设置确实提供了优势，并且未来仍然有用。（不总是这样，但这是一个必须做出的假设，以便进行这个讨论。）
- en: Does this abnormal reaction affect my outlook? It was supposed to go up. It
    went down. Does that mean it will continue to go down? Does that mean it is now
    oversold and will likely bounce in the next couple of days? Taken as 1 individual
    study it is impossible to determine.

    night letter that were also in effect. So it wasn’t terribly surprising that the
    market struggled Tuesday and Wednesday. And while the strong breadth was saying
    we were going higher, these other studies that looked at things such as the overbought
    price action and weak volume suggested a pullback was in order.

  zh: 。此外，还有来自周日晚上信件的另外3个短期看跌研究也在有效期内。所以市场周二和周三挣扎并不太令人惊讶。尽管强劲的广度表明我们将走高，但这些研究关注诸如超买价格行动和弱势成交量等方面，暗示着回调即将到来。
- en: So in this particular case, when the market didn’t react in the “normal” way
    to the setup studied in Tuesday’s blog, it didn’t concern me. On the other hand,
    if there were a large number of bullish studies, and few or no bearish studies
    and the market traded lower, then I might get concerned. If this abnormal behavior
    persisted then I would view risk as elevated and would consider adjusting my position
    size and trade management accordingly.

  zh: 所以在这种特定情况下，当市场没有以“正常”方式对周二博客中研究设置作出反应时，这并没有让我感到担忧。另一方面，如果有大量看涨研究，而看跌研究很少或没有，并且市场走低，那么我可能会开始担忧。如果这种异常行为持续存在，我会认为风险升高，并考虑相应调整我的持仓大小和交易管理。

    the lack of editing. I just started holding these webinars and I need to get up
