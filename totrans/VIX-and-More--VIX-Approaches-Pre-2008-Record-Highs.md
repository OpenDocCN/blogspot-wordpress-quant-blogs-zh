# VIX and More: VIX Approaches Pre-2008 Record Highs

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/05/vix-approaches-pre-2008-record-highs.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/05/vix-approaches-pre-2008-record-highs.html#0001-01-01)

Prior to 2008, the VIX had only managed to nudge its way over 45 on three instances:

1.  The 1998 [Long-Term Capital Management](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Long%20Term%20Capital%20Management) crisis
2.  The [Russian Financial Crisis](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Russian%20financial%20crisis) that preceded the LTCM debacle
3.  The height of the dotcom crash, when [WorldCom](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/WorldCom) filed for bankruptcy

The table below summarizes the top ten pre-2008 VIX closing highs. Should it hold, today’s [VIX spike](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20spikes) to 45.21 would put it at #3 all-time outside of the 2008 financial crisis.
