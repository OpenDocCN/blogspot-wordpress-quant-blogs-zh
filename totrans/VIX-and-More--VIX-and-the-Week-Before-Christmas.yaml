    2007 – has all manner of pundits scrambling to pull some sort of explanation out
    of a hat and weave it into their favorite bullish or bearish forecast for the
    markets.

    of the year. I have talked about this before on a number of occasions, including
    in [VIX Holiday Crush](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/12/vix-holiday-crush.html)
    and earlier this week in [Chart of the Week: Historical Volatility Plummets in
    Seasonal Swoon](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/12/chart-of-week-historical-volatility.html).
    Call it the [holiday effect](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Holiday%20Effect)
    or [calendar reversion](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/calendar%20reversion),
    but when the VIX’s 30-day window includes two holidays and two additional historically
    slow days in advance of the Christmas and New Year’s holidays, volatility has
    a tendency to take a vacation.'

    the last eight years, the annual low in the VIX fell during the week leading up
    to Christmas. Last year, some may recall that the VIX made its annual low on Christmas
    Eve. Back in 2004, the VIX had its low for the year on December 23^(rd); and in
    both 2003 and 2006, the VIX bottomed out for the year on December 18^(th). Today’s
    low makes it five pre-Christmas bottoms in eight years.

    consider that during the holiday season, experienced investors will give very
    little credence to the absolute level of expected 30-day implied volatility in
    S&P 500 options. Only after the first of the year should we take the VIX numbers
    seriously, regardless of how low prices and implied volatility levels may be marked
    down in the pre-Christmas shopping rush.
