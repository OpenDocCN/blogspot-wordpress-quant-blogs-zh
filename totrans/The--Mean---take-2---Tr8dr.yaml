    does not quantify properties of the mean and price relative to the mean in a way
    that is explicit.

    that the mean is such that it allows for some average max deviation.   We will
    be working with an evolving  distribution of amplitudes to modify the behavior
    of the mean.

    Alternatively we could require a AR(p) process to provide continuity with prior
    μ(t) observations.

- en: This is a relatively simple problem to solve after-the-fact, where we find a
    regressor f(t) that meets the above requirements.   The tricky aspect is in the
    observation of minima and maxima of the price difference in a way that we can
    integrate into a system of equations.

    The green regressor now represents the optimum.   This analysis points in the
    direction of determining an “online” estimate of the mean which works probabilistically.

    proportion to a running variance estimate.   Equating variance and level-duration
    arrive at a formulation for the amount of “innovation” and therefore deviation
    from the mean allowed.
