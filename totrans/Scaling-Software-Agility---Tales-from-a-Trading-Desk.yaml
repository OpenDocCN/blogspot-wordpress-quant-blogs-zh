    Software [Agility](http://scalingsoftwareagilityblog.com/). Worth the read.  Thoughts
    in the usual format.

- en: Page 104 – Eliminating the functional silos.  To me this title alone says it
    all.  The silo’d mentality is just utter madness in the 21st century of software
    development.  Often testing is treated as the 3rd grade silo, with UX perceiving
    this are the king of all silo’s.  Stop the madness!

- en: Page 107 – Testers.  Not sure I concur that testers become part of the team
    as soon as code starts to be laid.  I think they need to be part of the team much
    earlier, ensuring as part of the team what we are clear on the behaviour of the
    application solution we are building, and ensuring we have one set of testable
    behaviours and not n sets, one for each silo!

    advice is to use the available collaboration tools today such as VC, Hangouts
    etc to get the team “together” so that collaboration happens

- en: Page 320 – Balanced scorecard for measuring business performance.  One item
    that I haven’t seen considered much around measurement is looking at the life-cycle
    of stories, the acceptance criteria, defects etc.  Specifically around did we
    capture the essence of the story well at the beginning of the story discussion,
    or did we find there was a consider delta between when we started the discussion,
    and the final DONE story.  This metric in my view, the story life-cycle metric,
    would aid retrospectives, and improve the agility of any agile team in understanding
    where improvements can be gained.

    mentality.  Definitely some take away thought for distributed teams!
