- en: One of my best trades for 2009 has been a long position in [EEM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EEM),
    the [emerging markets](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/emerging%20markets)
    ETF. The [chart of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week)
    below shows that emerging markets have been consistently outperforming the S&P
    500 index since the beginning or January (see ratio study at top of chart) and
    was one of the first major equity groups to top its [200 day simple moving average](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/200%20day%20SMA)
    (dotted green line) in late April. While the SPX has been going sideways during
    May, emerging markets have continued to tack on gains, bolstered by rising prices
    for [commodities](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/commodities).

    stages in the 34-40 range, but for now at least, I see no reason to exit EEM at
    least until its performance relative to the SPX begins to falter.
