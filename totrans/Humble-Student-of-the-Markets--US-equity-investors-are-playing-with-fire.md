# Humble Student of the Markets: US equity investors are playing with fire

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2022/04/us-equity-investors-are-playing-with.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2022/04/us-equity-investors-are-playing-with.html#0001-01-01)

In bull markets, valuation generally doesn`t matter very much unless it reaches a nosebleed extreme, such as the NASDAQ Bubble. In bear markets, valuation defines the downside risk in equity prices.

As the Powell Fed has signaled it is dead set on a hawkish policy that does not preclude inducing a recession, valuation will matter soon. The 10-year Treasury yield stands at 2.8% and the S&P 500 forward P/E is 19.0\. The last time the 10-year reached these levels was 2028 when the forward P/E traded mostly in a range of 15-16 but bottomed at a panic low of 13.6\. The previous episode of a similar 10-year yield was in H2 2013 when the forward P/E was in the range of 13.5-15. 

All else being equal, this implies downside risk of -15% to -30% for the S&P 500\. That's why US equity investors are playing with fire.
