- en: For the second week in a row, the [chart of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week)
    focuses on economic fundamentals. This week I am featuring a graphic from the
    [Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis](http://stlouisfed.org/), that attempts to
    summarize current recession in terms of [industrial production](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/industrial%20production),
    real income, employment and [retail sales](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/retail%20sales).

- en: Starting from a business cycle peak of December 2007, the graphic below is an
    effort to normalize and rescale the economic data by assigning an index value
    of 100 to December 2007 numbers for each of the four statistics, so that comparative
    changes are easier to evaluate. Note that for each series, the average, high and
    low values are plotted for each month following the prior business cycle high.
    For industrial production, employment, and real retail sales, the average series
    includes the 10 recessions starting with the November 1948 business cycle peak.
    For real income, the average starts with the April 1960 peak.

- en: In terms of conclusions, the current recession is establishing new lows for
    industrial production, employment and retail sales. Curiously, real income, while
    low, is not even approaching record lows.

- en: Note also that in prior recessions, employment and retail sales have usually
    started to rebound by now, with real income and industrial production taking longer
    to bottom.

    continue to set record lows and how long before they rebound to the levels of
    the “average recession’”

    economic data and some native charting capabilities, the St. Louis Fed’s [Federal
    Reserve Economic Data (FRED)](http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/) site should
    probably be your first stop.]'
