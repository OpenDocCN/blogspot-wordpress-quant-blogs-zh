    observations he made. He was responding to a criticism of rational expectations
    based DSGE  modelling made by John Kay. What he says seems to make quite a bit
    of sense to me, especially about the need to model how people form expectations
    in a realistic way, going beyond the naive assumption of rational expectations,
    looking to empirical evidence instead (those comments come toward the end):'

  zh: 由2012年的Mike Woodford撰写，我觉得他提出了一些有趣的观点。他在回应John Kay对基于理性预期的DSGE建模的批评。他的观点似乎很有道理，特别是关于需要现实地建模人们如何形成预期，超越简单的理性预期假设，而是寻求经验证据（这些观点出现在最后）：

    and that may result in unnecessary fragility of the conclusions reached; and I
    suspect that this has a fair amount to do with the unease that Kay expresses about
    modern economic analysis. It has been standard for at least the past three decades
    to use models in which not only does the model give a complete description of
    a hypothetical world, and not only is this description one in which outcomes follow
    from rational behavior on the part of the decision-makers in the model, but the
    decision-makers in the model are assumed to understand the world in exactly the
    way it is represented in the model.

  zh: 分析强加了过于严格的内在一致性要求，可能导致得出的结论不必要的脆弱；我想这和Kay对现代经济分析的不安有很大关系。至少过去三十年里，标准的做法是使用这样的模型：不仅模型给出了一个假设世界的完整描述，而且这个描述是一个
    outcomes从模型中的决策者的理性行为中产生，而且模型中的决策者被假定为以完全相同的方式理解这个世界，就像模型所表示的那样。

- en: This postulate of “rational expectations,” as it is commonly though rather misleadingly
    known, is the crucial theoretical assumption behind such doctrines as “efficient
    markets” in asset pricing theory and “Ricardian equivalence” in macroeconomics.
    It is often presented as if it were a simple consequence of an aspiration to internal
    consistency in one’s model and/or explanation of people’s choices in terms of
    individual rationality, but in fact it is not a necessary implication of these
    methodological commitments. It does not follow from the fact that one believes
    in the validity of one’s own model and that one believes that people can be assumed
    to make rational choices that they must be assumed to make the choices that would
    be seen to be correct by someone who (like the economist) believes in the validity
    of the predictions of that model. Still less would it follow, if the economist
    herself accepts the necessity of entertaining the possibility of a variety of
    possible models, that the only models that she should consider are ones in each
    of which everyone in the economy is assumed to understand the correctness of that
    particular model, rather than entertaining beliefs that might (for example) be
    consistent with one of the other models in the set that she herself regards as
    possibly correct."

  zh: 所谓的“理性预期”假设，常被误解地认为是资产定价理论中的“有效市场”和宏观经济学中的“李嘉图等价”等教条背后的关键理论假设。它通常被描述成是模型内部一致性追求的简单后果，以及/或用个体理性来解释人们选择的必然推论，但实际上它并不是这些方法论承诺的必要推论。它并不源于一个人相信自己模型的有效性，以及相信人们可以假定为做出理性选择的必然性，从而使得他们必须被假定为会做出（比如经济学家那样）相信该模型预测有效的人看来是正确的选择。更不用说，如果经济学家自己接受考虑多种可能模型的必要性，那么她应该考虑的唯一模型，是在每个模型中都假定经济中的每个人都理解该模型的正确性，而不是怀有与她自己认为可能正确的其他模型相一致的信念。"

    --- according to which aggregate consumer expenditure is modeled as the solution
    to the Euler equation (a condition for intertemporal optimality) of a representative
    household, under the hypothesis of rational expectations, has difficulty matching
    the statistical properties of aggregate data too closely. In order to avoid making
    strongly counter-factual predictions, current-vintage empirical DSGE models commonly
    assume preferences for the representative household that incorporate a high degree
    of “habit persistence,” so that even when solved under the assumption of intertemporal
    optimization under rational expectations, consumer spending will not jump sharply
    in response to events that (at least according to the model) should predictably
    change the future path of household income. But the postulate of strong habit
    persistence has not found much support from studies of the behavior of individual
    households. An alternative explanation for the observation of persistent departures
    from the predictions of the rational expectations Euler-equation model under more
    standard preferences would be the existence of persistent departures of actual
    household expectations from those implied by the rational-expectations solution
    of the economists’ model."'

  zh: 根据[卢卡斯]批评发展起来的主流替代方案---其中总消费者支出被建模为代表性家庭的欧拉方程（实现跨时期最优的条件）的解，在理性预期假说下，很难与总体数据的统计特性过于接近。为了避免做出强烈反事实的预测，当前版本的实证DSGE模型通常假设代表性家庭的偏好，包含高度的“习惯持久性”，这样即使在理性预期下的跨时期优化解决下，消费者支出也不会因事件（至少根据模型）应该预测性地改变家庭收入未来路径而急剧上升。但强烈的习惯持久性的假设并没有从对单个家庭行为的研究中找到很多支持。对于观察到的持续偏离理性预期欧拉方程模型预测的另一种解释，可能是实际家庭预期与经济学家模型中理性预期解所暗示的预期之间存在持续的偏离。

    an approach to policy design that would focus on the robustness of policy to possible
    variations in the way that the consequences of the policy are understood by people
    in the economy, rather than focusing solely on the optimality of the policy if
    events unfold precisely as planned. It should lead, for example, to a concern
    to design policies that make it more difficult for asset bubbles to occur, or
    that should reduce the economic distortions that result from them when they do
    occur, rather than ignoring these issues on the ground that in a rational-expectations
    equilibrium the bubbles should not occur. It should also lead to greater attention
    to the communication policies of central banks and other governmental actors,
    rather than assuming that official explanations of policy are irrelevant given
    that economic agents can be expected to have rational expectations --- and that
    these “rational” expectations depend only on governmental actions, not upon speech."

  zh: 在给定政策下，为一系列可能的结果留出空间，将导致政策设计方法的转变，这种方法将专注于政策的鲁棒性，即政策在面对经济中人们对政策后果理解的可能变化时的适应性，而不是仅仅专注于如果事件完全按照计划发展时的政策最优化。例如，这应该导致我们关注设计使资产泡沫更难以产生的政策，或者减少泡沫发生时产生的经济扭曲，而不是因为在一个理性预期均衡中泡沫不应该发生而忽视这些问题。它还应该导致我们更加关注中央银行和其他政府行为者的沟通政策，而不是假设官方的政策解释在经济行为者可以预期是理性预期的情况下是无关的---这些“理性”的预期只取决于政府的行动，而不是取决于言论。
