# VIX and More: Looks Like No EOD Buy Signal From VIX:VXV Ratio

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/02/looks-like-no-eod-buy-signal-from.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/02/looks-like-no-eod-buy-signal-from.html#0001-01-01)

At 3:45 p.m. ET the [VIX:VXV ratio](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%3AVXV) is at 1.051.

Now this ratio will continue to update until 4:15 p.m., but for those looking for a signal to get long during the regular trading session, it does not look like we will have one.
