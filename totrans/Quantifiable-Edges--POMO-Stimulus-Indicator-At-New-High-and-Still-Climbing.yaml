- en: that measured the amount of POMO stimulus the Fed has injected into the system
    over a 1-month (20 day) timeframe.  As a review POMO stands for Permanent Open
    Market Operations and it is how the Fed goes into the open market to buy (or sell)
    treasury securities. The net effect of this buying is an influx of cash into the
    system. It appears a portion of that cash makes its way through the banking system
    and into the stock market. It also appears that the net effect of all this Fed
    buying is a positive influence on the stock market.

    500.  The indicator on the bottom is the total POMO buying in dollars that the
    Fed has done.  I've zoomed in to just show the last year and a half.

    20-day period in 2009 (or ever).

- en: of this week are also scheduled for POMO activity.  And a new schedule is due
    out on Friday so there is a chance we'll continue to see strong Fed buying in
    the weeks ahead.  Evidence suggests to me that this should have a bullish influence
    on the market.
