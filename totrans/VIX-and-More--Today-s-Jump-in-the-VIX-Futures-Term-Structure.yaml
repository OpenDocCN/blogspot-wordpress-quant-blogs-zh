    I invariably see a similar spike in emails with the theme of “Are we there yet?”
    Naturally, investors want to know how far the VIX is likely to move, when the
    markets should be expected to reverse and whether they should trade with the rising
    VIX or against it.

    simple as just plugging the current data into a spreadsheet and having it spit
    out something like another 2.16 points, 1.5 days and ‘start fading the VIX 45
    minutes after tomorrow’s open…’

    tendencies. The more difficult part is to put VIX spikes in an overall context
    and answer questions such as whether the market had been trending up or trending
    down, whether the proximate cause of the selloff in stocks is geopolitical, macroeconomic,
    technical or whatever. (See [Forces Acting on the VIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/07/forces-acting-on-vix.html)
    for a laundry list of potential influences on volatility.) Combining the art of
    context with the science of statistics, we are now on the doorstep of the dark
    art of [forecasting volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/volatility%20forecast).

- en: The best place to start when evaluating the current state of volatility is with
    the market’s expectations of future volatility and the best place to gather this
    information is in the form of [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures)
    (or perhaps SPX implied volatility). The graphic below shows how market expectations
    of future VIX values have changed from yesterday’s close (dashed blue line) to
    about 1 hour and 40 minutes into today’s session (solid red line.) While it certainly
    has felt like a huge move, with the VIX up 17%, the 10.1% move in the front month
    (August) VIX futures still leaves us well below where investors believe the VIX
    will be in September and October.

    VIX futures and want to understand them in the context of how they influence the
    VIX ETNs ([VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX), [XXV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XXV)
    and [VXZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXZ)), is that the VIX futures
    moves are not proportional. In fact, the front month typically moves much farther
    in percentage terms than the second month does, the second month moves more than
    the third month, and so on. One look at [VIX Futures: The One Picture to Remember](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/05/vix-futures-one-picture-to-remember.html)
    should drive that point home rather forcefully. The reason why front month futures
    are more sensitive to changes in the VIX than back month futures has to do with
    [mean reversion](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/mean%20reversion).
    Simply stated, any one day movement in the VIX should do very little to change
    one’s view of where the VIX will be six or seven months out. On the other hand,
    with VIX August futures and options set to expire one week from today, the ripple
    effect from today’s action is certain to be felt in terms of how investors are
    looking at stocks – and volatility – one week from now. This also gets at the
    essence of the difference between VXX and VXZ as well as the slope of the [term
    structure](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/term%20structure) (whether
    it be in [contango](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/contango) or [backwardation](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/backwardation))
    in the front months versus the back months.'
