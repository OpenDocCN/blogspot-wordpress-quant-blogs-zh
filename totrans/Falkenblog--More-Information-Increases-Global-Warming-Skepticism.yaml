    they become. They sampled 1,540 people on the following different types of information:
    how much scientific literacy they possessed (e.g., how well they answered questions
    about things like the time it takes for the Earth to circle the sun and the relative
    sizes of electrons and atoms), how numerate they were (e.g., their ability to
    engage in mathematical reasoning), what their cultural values were, and their
    thoughts on the risks of global warming and nuclear power. Overall, the more knowledge
    lowered the global warming concern (p-value around 6%).'

    industry and technology have low risk and restricting gun ownership is bad, vs.
    'egalitarian and communitarian', who believe industry and technology have a high
    risk and restricting gun ownership is good. I'm clearly a 'individualism-hierarchy'
    guy on that score, and can see why it dominated the explanation of the results,
    because if you are afraid of industry and technology, you probably love the Global
    Warming solutions to regulate technology and industry more. It would have been
    better to merely ask if they were Democrats or Republicans, because that would
    be less obviously correlated with the survey on nuclear power and global warming.

    knowledge-higher global warming' correlation within the those +1 standard deviation
    in the 'egalitarian and communitarian' camp was not statistically different than
    zero (I'm eyeballing it at around 12% p-value, these are psychologists so they
    do numbers reluctantly, it seems). Mooney is a professional pundit who lectures
    everyone on how to do science, which I guess involves ignoring standard errors
    and burying the lede when it hurts your point.

    would all agree with the progressive agenda to eliminate a missile defense system,
    not mention risks of abortions, and fight global warming (presumably with ethanol
    subsidies and bans on nuclear power). So he spun the survey to focus on the fact
    that the disagreement polarized the hierarchical-individualists and communitarian-egalitarians
    alone, and concludes that ''a little knowledge is a dangerous thing''. Yes, Mr.
    tendentious English major without an understanding of standard errors, it is.'
