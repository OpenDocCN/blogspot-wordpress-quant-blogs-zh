    – so far.  As of last night, I am now sitting at #2410 in the [CNBC Million Dollar
    Portfolio Challenge](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/CNBC%20Million%20Dollar%20Portfolio%20Challenge),
    up 6.2% so far this week and 37% for the duration of the contest.  This puts me
    in the top 0.5% of all contestants and is making it more difficult for me to ignore
    the contest in this space.'

    and stock selections.  For now, let’s just say that energy and biotech continue
    to fuel my performance.  I continue to seek out more volatility, not because I
    want to put my gains at risk, but because I am still over $500,000 behind the
    [top 20 portfolios](http://www.cnbc.com/id/17932532) and am concerned that I am
    not closing the gap quickly enough.

- en: 'Now for the fun part: when I mention the CNBC contest, not only do I get to
    trumpet myself a little, but I get to shine a little light on other great trumpet
    players.  The lead photo for this article is of [Lee Morgan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Morgan),
    who, in many respects inherited the mantle of “the next great jazz trumpeter”
    from [Clifford Brown](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Clifford%20Brown)
    following Brown’s death.  Morgan played extensively with [Art Blakey and the Jazz
    Messengers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Blakey) in the late 1950s and early
    1960s and is best know for “[The Sidewinder](http://www.amazon.com/Sidewinder-Lee-Morgan/dp/B00000IL26/ref=m_art_bow_1/103-0088821-7291048),”
    his 1963 album as a leader that still to this day shows up on most lists of the
    greatest jazz albums ever recorded.'
