# Magmasystems Blog: Raptor - Real-Time Analytics on Hadoop

> 来源：[http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2011/10/raptor-real-time-analytics-on-hadoop.html#0001-01-01](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2011/10/raptor-real-time-analytics-on-hadoop.html#0001-01-01)

I am starting to get interested in what Hadoop and "Big Data" can do for capital markets.

[This talk](http://www.hadoopworld.com/session/raptor-real-time-analytics-on-hadoop/)

at the upcoming Hadoop World in NYC looks pretty interesting, especially the part about predictive trading.

*Raptor combines Hadoop & HBase with machine learning models for adaptive data segmentation, partitioning, bucketing, and filtering to enable ad-hoc queries and real-time analytics.
Raptor has intelligent optimization algorithms that switch query execution between HBase and MapReduce. Raptor can create per-block dynamic bloom filters for adaptive filtering. A policy manager allows optimized indexing and autosharding.* *This session will address how Raptor has been used in prototype systems in predictive trading, times-series analytics, smart customer care solutions, and a generalized analytics solution that can be hosted on the cloud.*

If anyone attends this talk, please feel free to post a comment here and let me know how it went. Hopefully, there will be some slides up on SlideShare afterwards.
