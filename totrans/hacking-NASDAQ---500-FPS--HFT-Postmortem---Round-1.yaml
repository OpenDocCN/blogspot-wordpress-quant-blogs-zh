    a project even for a negative result as you learn the most from your failures
    than successes... or at least you *should.*

    over thinking and over analyzing the situation to the point where whichever direction
    you want to go there`s a ton of arguments for it but also against it.

    more precisely the behaviour of my orders to/from/on the exchange became a significant
    factor in profitability. Thus one of the goals was to test my assumptions on this
    vs what happens in the real world... which turned out to be very wrong. None the
    less it is extremely valuable info to know.

    about how much paper money you`ve made...  but is completely different to trading
    with real money on the real exchange with real consequences if you seriously fuck
    up. First few weeks were seriously terrifying, what if X happens, what if Y happens
    what if X causes Y which in turn means I need to liquidate everything I own, move
    into a tent and beg for change. The reality is if you have multiple independent
    saftey valves both aggressive and passive there`s not a whole lot that can go
    wrong and when it does, its not that bad. At this point, I`m quite comfortable
    running fully automated strategies on the exchange that puts 1000`s of orders
     into the book each day.

    completely different to have prod systems that are live and constantly evolving.
    Ended up writing a bunch of tools adding new components, doing new analysis and
    quite a few things that are simple but did not anticipate. All very valuable info
    for Round 2.

    oblivious infact as was focusing on historical data. I think your perspective
    & pattern matching radically changes when your no longer in back test time. When
    1 day is say 5 seconds becomes 1 day is 6.5 Hours of up/down/up/down I gained
    some intuition about how the market moves in the mid-freq time frame. Guess you
    could say, had no connection to the  market, as it was just numbers and stats
    - it had no personality.

- en: Had a choice of going all out with a significant % of net worth deposit, 5 figure
    monthly infra costs the hole 9 yards. Or a chunk of change deposit that's a small
    % of net worth and infra thats good but not on the edge. Chose the latter, my
    reasoning was have 0 experience trading and I should not risk my current assets on
    something thats unproven and un-tested. e.g. Do a test first before committing more
    cash, and I think this was the correct choice.

    is had no clearly profitable strategy. The strategies I wanted to run are all
    highly skewed by the infrastructure/comissions and behaviour of the exchange.
    So in hindsight the risk was actually very high as the result was highly dependent
    on a large unknown factor. The end result was after realizing the first batch
    of strategies wasn't going to work had to start from 0 on a completely different
    style of trading which there wasn't enough time to get up to speed on.

    especially when you eat/breath/sleep at one level its not easy to step back and

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The infrastructure/commissions was clearly a bad choice for the kinds of strategies
    I was testing. Yet its hard to say it was wrong given the cost & risk of more
    appropriate infra. In the end it was just an incorrect matching of strategy and infrastructure,
    given the goal is to make a profit. If the goal was to understand the exchange
    / market it was a good choice but.... in the real world one needs to make money.

     Round 1 was fun, exciting, learnt an absolute ton but need to re-calibrate before
    entering the ring again for Round 2.
