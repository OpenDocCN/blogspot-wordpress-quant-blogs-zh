- en: I am determined to play not spectate.  After 20 years of voracious reading,
    I have decided to write, and this blog represents my commitment.  More than likely
    it will be a reflection of me, so a lot about my work/passion money management
    and markets but also hopefully some worthwhile thoughts and observations.  I will
    be the writer and possibly the only reader ultimately but I know that I will benefit
    immensely from this project.  Any benefit to others will be extremely gratifying
    and help resolve my debt to all the wonderful authors that have entertained and
    enlightened me over the years.
