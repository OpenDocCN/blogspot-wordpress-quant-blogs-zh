    the last five trading sessions. This has only happened six times since the beginning
    of the VIX data history in 1990\. If we lower the bar to a 30% drop in five days,
    we pick up a total 8 instances; and if we move the threshold down to a 25% drop
    in five days, the number increases to 32 occasions, including quite a few data
    points that fall on consecutive days.

    the years that will be most prominent on the screen: 1991, 1994, 1997, 1998, 2002,
    and 2007\. Now 2008 is starting to make its impression in the historical database
    as well.'

- en: The question most people are interest in, however, is not so much the year of
    the previous instances as the subsequent performance of the stock market in the
    days and weeks following these 30% drops. The data show almost identical performance
    patterns for 25% and 30% five day drops in the VIX. Essentially, there is a very
    strong probability that during the next five days the SPX will be down at least
    1% or more. Following the classic [mean reversion](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/mean%20reversion)
    tendency, in looking out 10 trading days or more, the underperformance gap begins
    to diminish significantly, so any shorts opened today should have an anticipated
    lifespan of 10 days or less.
