- en: The [chart of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week)
    looks like it will now be a regular feature in this space. This week’s theme,
    once again, has a bond focus and extends the flight to safety theme from [last
    week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/11/chart-of-week-ratio-of-vix-to-yield-on.html).
    The graphic below captures the full 46 year history of the yield on the [10-Year
    U.S. Treasury Note](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/10%20Year%20Treasury%20Note).
    While difficult to discern from the graph, this is the first week the yield on
    that bond has ever closed below 3.0%. The reason for the low yield is the overwhelming
    demand cause by investors who are embracing a flight to safety approach to investing
    and see U.S. government debt as a safe haven for their assets.

- en: The low yields on U.S. government debt have several interesting implications.
    One implication is that a falling VIX does not reflect the action in the government
    bond markets. Another implication is that rising yields will indicate when money
    is starting to flow out of safe haven investments toward higher risk investments
    such as stocks. Finally, when the bulk of those currently holding government debt
    decide that it is appropriate to redeploy these assets into stocks, the pent-up
    demand for equities will be a formidable factor to reckon with.
