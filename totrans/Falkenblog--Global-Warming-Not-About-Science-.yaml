    jobs to be had! And he has a point. If we don't let companies burn fossil fuels
    like coal or gas, and don't build any more nuclear plants, all of us will have
    full time jobs collecting biomass for fuel as they do in Africa, or washing our
    clothes in the river, or walking to work. The smell of dung can really add a little
    zest to your smoked ribs.

    are generally worse for mammalian life than heat spells, but that's no mind. The
    reason why some of us think there's a pretext here is we have heard many similar
    warnings about the acid rain, Carter's malaise speech about the 70's energy crisis,
    the ozone hole, deforestation, and then when the metrics don't continue their
    trend and life goes on, they find a new boogie man. There's always a greater good,
    whether it's not discussing the gulag when coming back from the Soviet Union,
    exaggerating the risk of heterosexual AIDS, downplaying the corruption by the
    latest African kleptocrat, or promoting the "4 food groups", many, if not most
    'big ideas' are merely pretexts for people wanting to push various selfish agendas.

    ''could'' be produced by energy efficiencies and/or wind. I found this amusing
    as currently there are thousands of windfarms scattered around 27 states, all
    heavily subsidized, and they generate--when the wind is blowing--only the output
    of about two 750-megawatt gas-fired plants. Furthermore,'

    in wind technology, including the governmental units that would regulate, and
    thus control, this new technology. As most of the cost of wind is the capital
    cost, and these costs are generally private, and they are currently heavily subsidized
    by a network of agencies, as well as state, federal, county and city governments,
    who knows their cost i within a factor of ten? But just mention 'climate change'
    and the judge thinks you've properly referenced your assertion. If an energy company
    that gets paid to deliver energy and wants to make profits, decides it wants to
    build a coal plant to generate the energy, my guess is that it is because coal
    is the cheapest practical way to deliver the energy even after the subsidies.

    new entitlement that is adding pollutants to what remains of our water table,

    energy so that it is rationed, and thus take the myriad decisions of individuals
    and put them back into the hands of the government, who will dictate that we all

    who wish to give the government more power (and because power is zero-sum, implicitly
    less to individuals), and the corporate sycophants who think playing the game
    is the best way to stay in power. I''m not saying climate change is indefensible,
    I just think it''s sufficiently unproven that it shouldn''t even be a determinant,
    let alone the main determinant in making capital decisions like building energy
    plants (tech note: ''climate change'' refers to costs related to climate change
    and its myriad effects, not the costs of soot and smoke on lungs and crops). For
    example, estimates of the potential carbon tax can range from $10 to $100 per
    ton, so if one chooses $100, basically nothing will be built. Further, if one
