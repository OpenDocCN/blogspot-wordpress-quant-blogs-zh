    Germany has the [VDAX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VDAX), and
    some other countries (largely in Europe) have their own country volatility indices.
    Outside of North America and Europe, the volatility index pickings are slim, however,
    so when you want to get a sense of international volatility on a broader scale,
    you have to roll your own.

- en: In the chart below, the bottom half is a six month chart of implied volatility
    in the S&P 500 index. It is similar, but not identical to the VIX. Note the March
    high, a second peak in mid-July, and the recent uptrend in volatility.

- en: On the top half of the chart is the implied volatility in the Claymore BHY [BRIC](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/BRIC)
    (Brazil, [Russia](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Russia), India,
    and [China](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/China)) ETF ([EEB](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=EEB)),
    which attempts to replicate the performance of the Bank of New York BRIC Select
    ADR index. In contrast to the SPX, implied volatility in the BRIC ETF was relatively
    moderate in July, but has spiked dramatically over the course of the past two
    weeks. In short, fear and anxiety may be rising slowly in U.S. markets, but in
    the critical economies of Brazil, Russia, India, and China, signs of panic are
    much more widespread.

    are the buffer whose continued growth is supposed to buttress developed markets
    in this economic slowdown, then emerging markets need to find their own firm ground
    and soothe anxious investors before they can be expected to lubricate the wheels
    of the global economy.
