    moving against my positions so I am going to sit tight for a few days and take
    this time to explore more lucrative private investments. We recently secured a
    contract with a group of investors looking to divest their mineral rights over
    the next 12 months, which will be occupying a fair amount of my time. I will post
    more details about this project later, as well as an oil/gas private placement
    that should be coming to fruition next week.

    winter demand in Europe and Asia.
