- en: 'TABB has an [interesting](http://tabbforum.com/opinions/mifid-ii-its-coming-will-you-be-ready?page=2)
    article on MIFID II – “MIFID II: It’s Coming. Will You Be Ready?”.  I would agree
    with the article that data fragmentation is going to be an issue.  I suspect many
    companies will need to undertake some effort to resolve historical data linkage
    issues.  KYC will probably be one of the areas that companies needs to resolve
    data issues in based on RegTechFS [article](http://regtechfs.com/get-your-mifid-ii-kyc-checklist-for-2016/) –
    think data in CRM system (e.g. salesforce) coupled with various other internal
    databases that all need to be linked together to effectively offer an audit trail
    of customer interactions.'
