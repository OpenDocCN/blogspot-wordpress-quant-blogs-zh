## Fixed income buy side desktop

### February 26, 2008

So what is running on the desktop of a buy side fixed income trader ?  From my viewpoint here inside a dealer, I imagine the buy side do all their trades on Bloomberg, TradeWeb or by phone. But then I am an etrading guy, so I would say that, wouldn’t I ?

Is there anybody out there executing trades from an OMS like [Charles River](http://www.crd.com/technology/integration.php#etrading) ?   Would any buy side FI trader use [LatentZero](http://www.latentzero.com/liquidity-partner.html) ?
