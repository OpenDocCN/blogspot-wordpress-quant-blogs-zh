    the log price spreads are stationary, so it doesn''t matter which one we use for
    our trading strategy. However, for an unusual pair where its log price spread
    cointegrates but price spread does not (Hat tip: Adam G. for drawing my attention
    to one such example), the implication is quite significant. A stationary price
    spread means that prices differences are mean-reverting, a stationary log price
    spread means that returns differences are mean-reverting. For example, if stock
    A typically grows 2 times as fast as B, but has been growing 2.5 times as fast
    recently, we can expect the growth rate differential to decrease going forward.
    We would still short A and long B, but we would exit this position when the growth
    rates of A vs B return to a 2:1 ratio, and not when the price spread of A vs B
    returns to a historical mean. In fact, the price spread of A vs B should continue
    to increase over the long term.'

    they are cointegrating. But if they are in fact cointegrating, and if hA and hB
    are the weights which create the stationary portfolio P, we know that d(logP)
    cannot have a non-zero long term drift term represented by gamma*dt. So gamma
    must be zero. Now in order for gamma to be zero, the

    the variance of the portfolio market value in terms of the variances of the individual
    stocks and their covariance, and also to extend it to a portfolio with N stocks.
    This cointegration test for log prices is certainly simpler than the usual CADF
    or Johansen tests! (The price to pay for this simplicity? We must assume normal
    distributions of returns.)
