    markets of China's major Asian trading partners. Every single market is struggling
    with its 200 day moving average (dma), which is often used to delineates bull
    and bear markets, and, with the except of the Korean KOSPI, below its 200 dma.
    Investors have been overly focused on the gyrations of the Chinese stock market,
    which is divorced from the Chinese economy. If you want to really watch what is
    happening with Chinese growth, watch the "Greater China" markets - and they don't
    look healthy at all.
