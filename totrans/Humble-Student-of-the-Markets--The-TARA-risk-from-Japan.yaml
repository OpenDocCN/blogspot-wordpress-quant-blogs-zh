    as an asset class during the low-interest rate era. Now that rates have risen,
    there is a new acronym, TARA (There Are Reasonable Alternatives). Today, U.S.
    faces a TARA challenge from elevated Treasury yields.

    Treasury yield in the last 10 years until early 2023 when they diverged. The forward

    the TARA valuation threat to U.S. equities.

    from Japan.
