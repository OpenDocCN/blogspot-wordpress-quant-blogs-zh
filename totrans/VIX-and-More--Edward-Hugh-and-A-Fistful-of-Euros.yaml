- en: Ever since the [European sovereign debt crisis](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/European%20sovereign%20debt%20crisis)
    began flaring up, I have made it a habit to read Edward Hugh’s excellent [A Fistful
    of Euros](http://fistfulofeuros.net/). While [The Economist](http://www.economist.com/)
    and the [Financial Times](http://www.ft.com/home/us) are two top notch resources
    for U.S. investors hoping to avoid an Americentric bias and incorporate a European
    perspective into events as they unfold across the pond, it continues to appear
    that ultimately the fate of the euro zone will be determined by events in [Spain](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Spain).
    Given the likely trajectory of events, I can’t think of a better time than the
    present to be reading what Barcelona-based economist Hugh has to say about Spain
    and the European financial difficulties.
