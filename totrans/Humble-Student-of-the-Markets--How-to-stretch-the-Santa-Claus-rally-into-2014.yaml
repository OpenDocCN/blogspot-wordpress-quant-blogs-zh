    as of the close on Dec. 23 and sell them at the end of the trading session of
    Jan. 3\. Traders have been aware of this particular version of the Santa Claus
    rally at least since 1972, which is when the editors of the annual Stock Trader’s
    Almanac say they discovered it.

    he recommends to clients, though not by buying and selling individual stocks.
    Instead, he prefers the iShares Micro-Cap ETF, with an expense ratio of 0.72%.
    The fund replicates the performance of the smallest 1,000 stocks in the Russell
    2000 Index RUT +0.14% ; the average market cap of the stocks it owns is $420 million.

    well into the New Year. I discovered that European small caps have a tendency
    to outperform in both January and February. The chart below shows the relative
    return pattern of DFE, which is an ETF representing European small cap stocks,
    against FEZ, which is an ETF representing eurozone large caps.

    in a multi-year relative uptrend compared to large caps and the trend is supportive
    of further small cap outperformance.

    caps as they tend to be more exposed to the local economies than the large caps,
    which has a relatively large weighting in global companies such as BMW, SAP, EADS
    (Airbus), pharmaceuticals, luxury goods makers, etc.
