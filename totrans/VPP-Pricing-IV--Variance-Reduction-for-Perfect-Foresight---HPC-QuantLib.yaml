- en: Even though *perfect foresight* provides only an upper bound to the real VPP
    value the differences are often neglectable and the implementation efforts  are
    small compared with “exact” pricing based on finite difference methods or least
    square Monte-Carlo. *Perfect foresight* is the method of choice in conjunction
    with a linear programming optimizer if the problem contains time-integral constraints.
    Therefore it is worth to test the efficiency of two standard variance reduction
    techniques, namely antithetic sampling and quasi Monte-Carlo (QMC) together with
    a Brownian Bridge. Both methods are explained in [1], antithetic sampling in chapter
    4.2 and quasi Monte-Carlo in section 5\. Randomized QMC is used to calculate the
    error estimates for QMC as it is outlined in chapter 5.4.

- en: Using the parameterization of the previous section [VPP Pricing III](https://hpcquantlib.wordpress.com/2011/08/07/vpp-pricing-iii-exact-pricing-based-on-finite-difference-methods/),
    QMC in conjunction with a Brownian Bridge clearly out-performance the other algorithms
    for a 6 month contract as can be seen in the diagrams below. The code is available
    [here](http://hpc-quantlib.de/src/vpp5.zip). It depends on the latest [QuantLib](http://www.quantlib.org/)
    version from the [SVN trunk](http://sourceforge.net/p/quantlib/code/HEAD/tree/)
    or the upcoming QuantLib 1.2 release. If you want to generate the plots you’ll
    also need [R.](http://www.r-project.org/) [](https://hpcquantlib.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/plot1.png)
