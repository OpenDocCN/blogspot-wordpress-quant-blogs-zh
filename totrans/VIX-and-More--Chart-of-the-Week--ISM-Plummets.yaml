    32.4 number, but investors should keep in mind that in the 61 year history of
    the ISM index, only three previous recessions (1949, 1974-75 and 1980) have seen
    lower ISM numbers. Even more concerning than the headline manufacturing index
    number was the [report](http://www.ism.ws/ISMReport/MfgROB.cfm) that new orders
    are now lower than they have been at any time in the 60 year history of the data.

    below captures in ISM and the SPX from 1950\. In addition to the obvious cliff
    dive that began in September, I find it interesting that the manufacturing index
    has been slowly trending down since hitting a high in May 2004.

    issues (particularly housing, manufacturing and consumer spending), as well global
    events that shape the geopolitical and economic landscape.
