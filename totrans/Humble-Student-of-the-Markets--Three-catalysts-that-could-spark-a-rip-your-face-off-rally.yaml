    The pattern has been the same on Wednesday and Thursday. Futures opened the day
    deeply negative, first on a hot CPI print Wednesday and a hot PPI print and earnings
    disappointment Thursday, but rallied over the day to erase most, if not all of
    the previous losses. The banks, which kicked off Q2 earnings season, have mostly
    been disappointing, but it only took one positive surprise to spark Friday's relief
    rally.

    are some other catalysts that could spark an unexpected "rip your face off" rally
    and change the narrative from bearish to bullish.
