    relief rally runs its course. For now, I am giving the bull case the benefit of
    the doubt, but a number of indicators are troubling me.

    qualified, but no major average achieved a gain of more than 1.4%. It's not quite
    time to throw in the towel yet, but I would like to see signs of positive momentum

    index, which measures whether high-frequency economic releases are beating or
    missing expectations, is starting to keel over. While the level remains positive,
    indicating more beats than misses, the loss of momentum is a concern.

    recovery has been incredibly uneven as much of the gains have accrued to the top
    income earners. This effect can be seen in the relative performance of Tiffany
    (TIF) against Wal Mart (WMT). The chart below shows the TIF/WMT ratio (in black)
    and the SPX (in orange). A rising ratio has been correlated with a rising stock
    market. The ratio recently saw a minor violation of its relative uptrend, but
    it could be a blip related to uncertainties over the government shutdown.
