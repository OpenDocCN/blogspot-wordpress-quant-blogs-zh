    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    in the direction of the main Trend Model signal. A bullish Trend Model signal
    that gets less bullish is a trading "sell" signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend
    Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading "buy" signal. The history of
    actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of the trading model are shown by
    the arrows in the chart below. The turnover rate of the trading model is high,
    and it has varied between 150% to 200% per month.

    recession call. Recessions don’t happen out of thin air. Data starts shifting
    ahead of a recession. Manufacturing activity sags. Housing starts tumble. Jobless
    claims start rising. You know the drill, and we are seeing any of it yet.

- en: As far as the Fed is concerned, I don’t think we are seeing evidence that policy
    is too tight. The flattening yield curve indicates policy is getting tighter,
    to be sure. But as far as recession calls are concerned, it’s inversion or nothing.
    And even inversion alone will not definitively do the trick. I think that if the
    Fed continues to hike rates or sends strong signals of future rate hikes after
    the yield curve inverts, then you go on recession watch.

  zh: 就美联储而言，我不认为我们看到了政策过于紧缩的证据。收益率曲线的平坦化确实表明政策正在收紧。但就衰退预测而言，要么是反转，要么什么都没有。即使只有反转，也不会明确地起作用。我认为，如果美联储在收益率曲线反转后继续加息或发出未来加息的强烈信号，那么你就开始关注经济衰退。

    curve with two more hikes and then take a step back. To be sure, it will be hard
    to stand down or even reverse course on the yield curve alone. After all, the
    yield curve is a long leading indicator. It will be the outlying data. But there
    is a reasonable chance the Fed will not tempt fate in the absence of a very real
    inflationary threat.
