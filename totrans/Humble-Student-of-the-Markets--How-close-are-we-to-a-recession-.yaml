    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    in the direction of the main Trend Model signal. A bullish Trend Model signal
    that gets less bullish is a trading "sell" signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend
    Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading "buy" signal. The history of
    actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of the trading model are shown by
    the arrows in the chart below. The turnover rate of the trading model is high,
    and it has varied between 150% to 200% per month.

    recession. Either via overtightening or failing to loosen quickly enough in response

    recession call. Recessions don’t happen out of thin air. Data starts shifting
    ahead of a recession. Manufacturing activity sags. Housing starts tumble. Jobless
    claims start rising. You know the drill, and we are seeing any of it yet.

    turn now. Maybe yesterday. And you would have to believe that turn would be happening
    in the midst of a substantial fiscal stimulus adding a tailwind to the economy
    through 2019\. I just don’t see it happening.

    is too tight. The flattening yield curve indicates policy is getting tighter,
    to be sure. But as far as recession calls are concerned, it’s inversion or nothing.
    And even inversion alone will not definitively do the trick. I think that if the
    Fed continues to hike rates or sends strong signals of future rate hikes after
    the yield curve inverts, then you go on recession watch.

    curve with two more hikes and then take a step back. To be sure, it will be hard
    to stand down or even reverse course on the yield curve alone. After all, the
    yield curve is a long leading indicator. It will be the outlying data. But there
    is a reasonable chance the Fed will not tempt fate in the absence of a very real
    inflationary threat.
