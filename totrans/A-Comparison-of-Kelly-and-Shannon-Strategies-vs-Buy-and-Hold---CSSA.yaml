    strategy actually performed. We will also introduce the concept of a Kelly methodology
    introduced in the paper by Ed Thorp. The math is a little hairy for most, but
    for the brave and diligent the link is here [http://www.bjmath.com/bjmath/thorp/paper.htm](http://www.bjmath.com/bjmath/thorp/paper.htm)
    This post was developed by my research associate– Henry Bee, who besides being
    a whiz with numbers is also a good trader/writer. You can check out his blog on
    Seeking Alpha for some fundamental insight and trading ideas.

    rebalancing.  These levels were chosen to make this realistic rather than a thought
    experiment—daily rebalancing obviously cannot survive trading costs. We made assumptions
    concerning transaction costs that were consistent with institutional execution.
    Each day, the demon rebalances back to equal weight if the portfolio is greater
    than or equal to 1% in absolute value terms in either direction. The Stupid Kelly
    methodology is derived using expected returns and variance assumptions from the
    previous 3 years. Much like the typical  armchair retail investor–the Stupid Kelly
    assumes that what happened in the last 3 years will repeat in the future–thus
    if we had a poor 3-year period its time to go into the bomb shelter, and if the
    last 3 years everyone has been making money, its time to back up the truck and
    get into the market. The bet size is dictated using a formula mentioned in the
    paper.  This bet size is constrained at 2x leverage– a fairly typical adjustment
    designed to prevent overestimation bias—– in the markets we do not have any certainty
    concerning the future distribution of returns (unlike games of chance). The Smart
    Kelly methodology is derived using forward looking data such as the beta, treasury
    bond yields and other inputs to derive an equity risk premium. The risk assumptions
    incorporated implied volatility or variance (historical was used at earlier dates).
    Lets look at the results:'

    beginning to improve versus buy and hold in recent years. Impressively it still
    performed reasonably well from 1965-2000 in the “pre mean-reversion days.” This
    is because it capitalizes on brownian motion versus a pure reversion assumption. Though
    not visible in this data, the rolling sharpe ratio for the demon portfolio versus
    buy and hold was actually underperforming until the last decade. The recent acceleration
    in performance can be attributed in my opinion mainly to greater randomness in
    the markets, and only partially to increased mean-reversion. The “stupid” kelly
    portfolio was the worst method, and only made significant progress during the
    giant bull market from 1982-1999\. Unsurprisingly that was one of the few periods
    where retail investors actually made money. In contrast, the “smart” kelly portfolio
    which used forward looking data and was long-term contrarian performed the best
    of all three on an absolute and risk-adjusted basis. Combining the “smart” kelly
    portfolio and the shannon’s demon portfolio obviously would be a nice way to capitalize
    on the “academic” notions that 1) markets are efficient and exhibit brownian motion
    patterns (randomness) 2) there is a “risk premium” in equity markets–investors
    must be compensated for bearing risk.  So negative longer-term historical returns,
    high expected variance, and high long-term bond yields mean that investors require
    a higher premium (reward) to invest. So with all the technical analysis and fundamental
    analysis methods we use to try to beat the market sometimes its nice to have back
    up in case those crazy professors are right all along!
