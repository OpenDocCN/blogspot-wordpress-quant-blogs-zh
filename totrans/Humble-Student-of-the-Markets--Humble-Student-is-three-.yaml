    ("Qwest") said, "Investors around the world have been challenged by the volatility
    stemming from significant outbreaks of asset inflation and deflation. Prominent
    economists and investors remain completely divided in their opinions on the macro-economic
    outlook. Individual investors will be faced with volatile swings in the markets
    in the years ahead and will need to know when these major trends change and what
    assets will respond positively to the change in trend." In response to this investment
    environment, Mr. Hui developed and launched, in 2009, the Qwest Inflation-Deflation
    Timer Model (the "Timer Model"), a proprietary quantitative investment model used
    to identify inflation and deflation trend changes. Mr. Hui explained, "I will
    use the trend signals from the Timer Model to allocate the Fund's assets into
    specific asset classes that traditionally respond positively during an inflation
    trend, a deflation trend or a neutral trend."
