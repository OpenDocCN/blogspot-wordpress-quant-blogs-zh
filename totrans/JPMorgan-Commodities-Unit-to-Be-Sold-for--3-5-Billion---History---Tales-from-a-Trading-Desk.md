## JPMorgan Commodities Unit to Be Sold for $3.5 Billion – History

> Wall Street banks, facing tighter scrutiny from regulators, are moving to get out of the business of physical commodities trading.
> 
> On Wednesday, JPMorgan Chase took a big step in that direction, announcing that it had agreed to sell its physical commodities trading unit to the Mercuria Energy Group, a rapidly growing Swiss trading firm, for $3.5 billion in cash.
> 
> The Volcker Rule, part of the sweeping Dodd-Frank financial regulatory overhaul, restricts the ability of banks to trade for their own accounts. That extends to limits on some commodities trading.
> 
> The Federal Reserve is also considering limiting banks’ commodities activities to try to reduce their exposure to a potential source of instability.

More interesting for some of us is the [history](http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/03/19/jpmorgan-mercuria-timeline-idUKL2N0MG0JH20140319) of the unit, captured by the Reuters article.  Which company did you work for?
