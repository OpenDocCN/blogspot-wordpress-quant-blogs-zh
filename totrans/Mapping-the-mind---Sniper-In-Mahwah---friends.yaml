- en: This blog has been quite silent. The end of the year was really busy (I took
    too much academic responsibilities, I travelled too much and published [too](http://www.zones-sensibles.org/livres/)
    [much](http://www.vies-paralleles.org) [books](http://www.theatre-operations.com/portfolio/dictionnaire-historique-et-critique/)).
    As usual, I only work on market structure and HFT when I have free time (nights
    and week-ends), but I won’t take holidays before mid-september, so I’ll work all
    summer long and I’ll have the the time to post some words – about the nature of
    time, about why I’m roaming the HFT and market structure worlds (some are really wondering
    why an anthropologist fell in microseconds, matching engines and payments for
    order flow), about the pattern recognitions experiments I recently [tried](http://www.theatre-operations.com/portfolio/dictionnaire-historique-et-critique/),
    about a fascinating story involving a guy who pirated intellectual property (and
    the case is far more captivating than the Aleynikov one, even if the recent [events](http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/06/us-goldman-sachs-aleynikov-appeal-idUSKCN0PG1L020150706)
    in this last case are striking), and other stuff.

    the new electronic pits (the matching engines) and searching for dishes in my
    backyard. I’ll post the season 2 of “HFT in my backyard” in three episodes early
    September – some may think that I’m too fanatic but trust me: working on those
    microwave networks is really fun, this little world deserves an *addendum*. Because the
    Creator shaped the world in six days, I’ll publish early October a long 6-part
    series about the “QUANTLAB TECHNOLOGIES LTD. (BVI), AND QUANTLAB FINANCIAL, LLC,
    Plaintiffs, versus VITALIY GODLEVSKY, ANDRIY KUHARSKY, ANNA MARAVINA, PING AN,
    EMMANUEL MAMALAKIS, AND SXP ANALYTICS, LLC, Defendants ”, case number 4:09-cv-04039. Some
    months ago the name of Quantlab showed up because someone in the company visited
    this blog, and then I read [this](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303563304579445381552266144) very
    good report by Bradley Hope in the *Wall Street Journal*. Visiting floors is one
    thing; reading thousands and thousands of court files coming from such a case
    is another. By spreading the investigation to others affairs, and other court
    files, those thousands of pages shape an interesting view on the high-frequency
    trading world.'

    the world, but because of religion. The fact I am working on the relationship
    between market structure and religion is one of the reasons this blog is quite
    silent: I spend too much time reading the old philosophers who, for instance,
    coined the word “risk” around the 12th century. Thanks to these medieval monks, news
    horizons appeared, and philosophical answers showed up (I’ll try to talk about
    those philosophers in the *Xenia of Saint Petersburg* series).'

    the origins of the word became a friend, and we decided to work on a book that
    has nothing to to with economy: a book about a medieval monk who designed some
    of the most fascinating drawings I have never met: [Opicino de Canistris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opicinus_de_Canistris).
    Opicino (1296-1353), probably because he suffered from schizophrenia, left two
    manuscripts (now in the Vatican Library) with a lot of very complex graphic diagrams.
    Here is his autobiography:'

    from a Japanese pharmaceutic firm, who develops medicinal products against schizophrenia, has allowed us to buy
    dozens of high-res files to the Vatican), but I don’t think the Vatican guys will
    love that. They are quite, let’s say, rigorous with the rights (I’ll post some
    photographies of the book when it’s done). Anyway, this book (due to be published
    in French in October, and then in Italian, English, German, etc., next year) will
    be probably the first one to expose without prejudice the life and the work of Opicino
    de Canistris. The problem is that when you start to immerse yourself in those
    diagrams, when you take hours to understand them to realize that they all shape
    the map of an insane mind, at some point you lose your own mind. Working on Opicino
    is quite like a drug, a journey in a fascinating world – as Shakespeare wrote,
    “though this be madness, yet there is method in ‘t”. I’ll try to keep my head
    above the water. Anyway, it seems that the next few months will be all about religion.
    I am an unbeliever, but the story of those who tried to play HFT games for religious
    reasons showed that God is never far away. And that’s a good thing.
