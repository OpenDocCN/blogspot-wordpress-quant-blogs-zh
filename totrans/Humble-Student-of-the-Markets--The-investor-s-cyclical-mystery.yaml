- en: Copper is a cyclically sensitive metal that was given the moniker of Dr. Copper,
    because it is said to have a Ph.D. in economics because of its ability to forecast
    global economic trends. Its recent breakout from a 10-month base excited a lot
    of people. Similarly, the turnaround in the relative performance of materials
    stocks was interpreted as a cyclical green shoot.

    message of economic stagnation. Both copper and gold are metals with inflation
    hedge properties, but copper is more cyclically sensitive. The copper/gold ratio
    acts as a cyclical indicator to filter out the inflation sensitivity of changes
    in metal prices.
