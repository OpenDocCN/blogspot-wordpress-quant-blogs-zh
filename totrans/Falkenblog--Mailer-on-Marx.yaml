- en: Norman Mailer was a famous American writer who died in 2007, who wrote with
    great forcefulness. People can still have interesting things to say (or in Mailer's
    case, say them in an interesting way), yet still be moon-bat crazy in many areas
    of their lives. So, listening to

    It was before the marginalist revolution, so did not understand ''value'', instead
    thinking all value came from labor. To note how stupid this is, think about someone
    spending 10 hours writing a paper--does this make it worth ''10 hours'' worth
    of ''steel''? Depends on what came out, and probably its worth is inversely correlated
    with the time spent on it. You can see a nice summary of its irrelevancy by going
    to the Wikipedia on volumes [1, 2 and 3,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital,_Volume_I)
    and note that the economic arguments are not even used by Marxist economists today
    (falling rate of profit? recessions becoming wider every time? Surplus value?).'

- en: They say sure, he got the details wrong, but he had great vision. Most of the
    book was very specific, and those little examples and arguments were all wrong.
    I guess by some cosmic analytic karma, if all your particulars are wrong the theme
    must be really profound. Literary types have always like it because it gives a
    scientific pretense to their statist and egalitarian instincts (based on hope
    alone, as all socialist enterprises turn out to labeled 'state capitalism' or
    some other oxymoron). Yet I like it when people like Mailer make such points,
    because it lays clear how hollow their base assumptions are, because it is simply
    impossible to 'think more clearly' after reading such a book.
