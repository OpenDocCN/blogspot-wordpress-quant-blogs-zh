    but it is their responsibility to check for basic errors in math or methodology,
    just as they would check for errors in grammar or spelling. Peer review offloads
    any responsibility for publishing bad papers onto anonymous members of the scientific
    community. It’s a perfect form of blame passing that everyone else wishes they
    could use.

    sides in personal and professional quarrels. It is also the reason that reviewers
    themselves prefer to remain anonymous. No scientist wants to suffer the professional
    and personal consequences from either refusing or accepting a paper they should
    not have refused or accepted. It is also why peer review is a superficial review.
    The reviewers do not wish to be dragged into the minutia of scientific debates
    and quarrels. Instead, they concentrate on the basics that everyone can agree
    on.

    peer review allows an editor to reject papers without having everyone hate him.
    Peer reviewers correct obvious errors, and make recommendations about the usefulness
    of a paper. The former point is objective and straightforward, but note this does
    not involve checking the raw data for fraud, or replicating an algorithm. I've
    refereed many papers, and I never independently tried to replicate their results
    with their algorithm and data. If they faked their data subtly, only posterity
    would punish them, not a referee.

    guessing what other people would like to reference. Most models do not have straightforward
    empirical implications, so this is often an assessment of which toolkit is considered
    cutting edge. Economics often builds huge Rube Goldberg machines that potentially
    are useful, which are never refuted, but rather, fade away as the professors who
    made their reputations on these models retire, and the new generation sees that
    they are quite useless.

    equations modeling the GDP. These were all considered the apex of 'good form',
    and so any results in these frameworks, if sufficiently rigorous, were published.
    If you submitted a paper today using these frameworks, you would get rejected
    out of hand because they are no longer considered useful. But that came through
    long experience, and not any definitive rejection. Even today, some results based
    on dynamic programming, and using vector autoregressions, are published merely
