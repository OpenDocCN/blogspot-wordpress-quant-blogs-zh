    Care Act on Sunday, telling CNN’s Candy Crowley that “destroying the entire planet
    is really the best and only way to stop Obamacare.”

    ceiling, but let’s not kid ourselves. Those are only half measures,” he told Crowley.
    “If we are really serious about stopping Obamacare, we’ll destroy the entire planet.”

    is like a parasite that needs a host to feed on. If you want to kill the parasite
    you kill the host, and in this case that means killing this planet. As long as
    there’s a planet Earth, the nightmare of Obamacare could always come screaming
    back to life.”

    Cruz said, “This is something that my colleagues and I have been working on for
    some time.”

    Congress to support his proposal of obliterating Earth, but he ended his interview
    on a personal note: “Candy, I don’t want my children and my children’s children
    to live in a world with Obamacare. And the best way to guarantee that is by destroying
    the world.”'
