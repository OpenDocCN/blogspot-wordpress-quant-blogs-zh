    the return is basically zero. I pulled 39 High Yield ETFs, and their average return
    from 2007 to present has been about 21%, and is the same whether I equal-weight
    or value weight them, and note these have a survivorship bias in them, in that
    I am not using all extant funds from 2007\. The JPC benchmark, the Bloomberg Active
    Index for Corporate Preferred funds generates a similar 20% return over that period.'

- en: In contrast, the Merrill High Yield Master II shows a whopping 43% return over
    this period, twice what bonds with that moniker actually generated. The Merrill
    index is not tradeable, which is very important. The bid-ask spreads in junk bonds
    are very high, often 5 points, and indices don't internalize these. Also, if you
    are big, there's trade impact. Academics might look at the Merrill index to estimate
    the return to junk bonds, but there's a 22% difference here, and that excludes
    all the survivorship biases in my comparison to actual funds.
