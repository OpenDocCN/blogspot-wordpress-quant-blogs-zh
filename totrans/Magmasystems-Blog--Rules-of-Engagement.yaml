    certain respects.

- en: I have been thinking about what I would like to include in a retrospective to
    the client in order to help them manage future projects successfully. Instead
    of enumerating what I consider to be the positives and negatives of the project,
    I would like to add some of the aspects to my master “Lessons Learned” list, and
    also to reiterate some of my long-standing project-management processes.

- en: If you are bringing in consultants to lead the technical team, then tell your
    team members and enforce the leadership. If you are expecting your consultants
    to be short-term body-shoppers who are coding, then tell them this up front. Do
    not allow incorrect perceptions to pervade the group.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There will always be bruised feelings when you bring consultants on to a project
    in a leadership role. We consultants completely understand this. Nobody wants
    their work to be reevaluated and critiqued. If the consultants are being brought
    in to do rearchitecture, then they must be given the power to lead the effort.

- en: As a project manager, make sure that you know what all of your team members
    are doing, and make sure that all team members know what each other is doing.
    Make sure that the server side and client side teams communicate. Many server-side
    devs have also done GUI work and vice-versa.

- en: If you have to support a legacy version of your product, then make sure that
    you are able to delegate that task to certain members of the team. Have a plan
    to get these “legacy developers” involved with the new development. The legacy
    devs are subject matter experts who are important to the whole team.

- en: As mentioned above, do not isolate the groups. Involve the Business Analysts
    and Business Users where appropriate. Unless there are well-defined isolation
    layers, make sure that you try to completely define the communication layers and
    formats between the client and server. If the BA’s are planning something new,
    have them run it by the entire team so that the team can discuss the ramifications
    on the architecture.

    then stick to it.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Consultants get paid a lot of money, and their efforts are usually time-boxed.
    So, make sure that they are productive from day one. Have all user accounts set
    up. Have all of the software ready. If this software requires additional registration,
    then make sure that this is done. Make sure that there are enough licenses for
    the software, and make sure that support packages have been purchased.

    Developers need about 2gb of RAM and about 100gb of free hard drive space. Make
    sure that certain shared drives can be accessed.

    and to expect them. If a consultant is made to wait in the lobby while security
    tries to track down someone to sign them in, then this serves nobody.

- en: I have talked about this before. If you are writing a trading system, then the
    developers should be able to have access to the traders. The developers should
    be able to peek over a trader’s shoulder while he is working. The developers should
    have a complete feel for the kind of system that a trader would like to have.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If there are BAs that the developers must interact with, then make sure that
    the devs and BAs have constant interaction. Make sure that the BAs know if some
    of their ideas will be difficult to implement.

- en: '**Do Not Pair-Program Unless Absolutely Necessary**'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I continue to abhor pair programming. I think that it cuts down productivity
    in a big way. I think that the best development is done when the developer is
    “in the zone”, and does not have to expend energy explaining every move to someone
    else.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Instead, have design meetings and developer meetings. It does not have to be
    “Big Design Up Front”. However, if a developer is architecting a crucial module,
    then let him present the design to the entire team and get critiques before the
    effort is too far gone.

- en: Do you know why a product is being refactored? Does the business absolutely
    need it? Do you really need to rewrite an entire application from scratch?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Remember that, when you refactor an application, you need a plan to retain all
    of the business logic that is built in to the existing app.
  prefs: []

- en: Make sure that the code has comments. Make sure that there is plenty of technical
    documentation. Make sure that all of the business rules are documented.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    difficult to rearchitect a system if the hands of 30 different people have been
    in it over the years.
