# QuantLib 1.2 with VC11 | Quant Corner

> 来源：[https://quantcorner.wordpress.com/2012/10/28/quantlib-1-2-with-vc11/#0001-01-01](https://quantcorner.wordpress.com/2012/10/28/quantlib-1-2-with-vc11/#0001-01-01)

This is a very short post, today.

We make available a solution of the **QuantLib** library for **VC11**. In fact, we converted the **VC10** projects of the **QuantLib** library for **VC11**.

Please, click [here](https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B4cGI2MhdkteQWRxSEhmbVRmQ1E "QuantLib-1.2.1_VC11") to download the whole **QuantLib 1.2.1** project, comprising the files we added.

A document on how to build and use **QuantLib** with **VC11** is underway. In the meantime, users of previous versions of **QuantLib** must be able to cope.
