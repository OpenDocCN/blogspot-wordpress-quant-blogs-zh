    as almost a religious experience. But, when the stadium lights go out on Sunday
    night, will the country be a better place? Will its citizens be in a better place?
    No! Will the Super Bowl have benefitted anything or anyone other than the entities
    listed above? No! Jobless numbers will continue to rise; 45 million, including
    18 million children, will still be without health insurance; schools will continue
    to hold bake sales to raise funds; much-needed human services will continue to
    be cut; veterans and the care they need will continue to be ignored; the causes
    and cures of deadly diseases will still remain a mystery, and government's indifference
    toward the average American will continue.

    I think that all meaning is put into life by humans. That we enjoy sporting events,
    which are unimportant in themselves, is very important because all of life is
    about putting meaning and interest into intrinsically unimportant things. Existentialism
    sucks if you take it to mean 'I must find deep meaning and fix the problems of
    the world', rather than, 'life's pointless but interesting and fun'. Things that
    give me pleasure are all pointless in the context of a large, cold, world with
    injustice, death, and the eventual catastrophic ending (the sun will run out of
    fuel someday). If you think about poverty, the meaning of life, disease, and inequality,
    ALL THE TIME you won't be any happier, and won't improve upon those problems any
    faster.

    of two people don''t amount to a hill of beans. But this is our hill. And these
    are our beans!" Keep to your beans, and enjoy them.'
