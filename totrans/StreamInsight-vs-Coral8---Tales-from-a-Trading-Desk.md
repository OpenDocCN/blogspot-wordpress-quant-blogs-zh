# StreamInsight vs Coral8 | Tales from a Trading Desk

> Êù•Ê∫êÔºö[https://mdavey.wordpress.com/2009/08/19/streaminsight-vs-coral8/#0001-01-01](https://mdavey.wordpress.com/2009/08/19/streaminsight-vs-coral8/#0001-01-01)

## StreamInsight vs Coral8

Anyone got free time to compare the performance of Coral8 (currently version 5.6) vs StreamInsight (CTP2). Although not a fair comparison in terms of performance, its still interesting none the less from a viewpoint of easy of adapter development, LINQ vs CCL, debugging and performance. On the performance angle, one can probably make a (big) assumption that if StreamInsight is 1.x-2 slower than Coral8, by StreamInsight 1.0 Microsoft should be close? üòâ
