    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    bullish reaction to Thursday's ugly action while exhibiting positive RSI divergence.

    retracement, which is also the site of the 200 day moving average.

    fastest in market history, even compared to the Crashes of 1987 and 1929\. Bear
    in mind that if this was the capitulation low, the market bounced at the initial
    low in 1929, and in 1987\. Each had very different results. Both were market crashes,
    one went on to mark the start of the Great Depression, the other was just a blip
    in a continuing economic expansion.
