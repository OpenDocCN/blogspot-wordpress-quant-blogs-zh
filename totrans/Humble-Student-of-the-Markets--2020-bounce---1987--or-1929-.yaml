    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    bullish reaction to Thursday's ugly action while exhibiting positive RSI divergence.
    If this is the long awaited bounce, the most logical resistance level is the 50%
    retracement, which is also the site of the 200 day moving average.

    in mind that if this was the capitulation low, the market bounced at the initial
    low in 1929, and in 1987\. Each had very different results. Both were market crashes,
    one went on to mark the start of the Great Depression, the other was just a blip
    in a continuing economic expansion.

  zh: 这次进入熊市领域（定义为下跌20%）是市场历史上最快的，即使与1987年和1929年的崩盘相比也是如此。请记住，如果这是恐慌的低点，市场在1929年的初次低点和1987年都反弹过。两者结果截然不同。两者都是市场崩盘，其中一个标志着大萧条的开始，另一个只是持续经济扩张中的一个小插曲。
