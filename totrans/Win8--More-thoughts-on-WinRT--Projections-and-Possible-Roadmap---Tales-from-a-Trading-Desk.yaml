    style applications the [WinRT](http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2011/Sep-15.html)
    has returned to native code. From a future roadmap, its clear from BUILD we have
    the 1-2 year WinRT view ‚Äì Metro style UI applications, but what‚Äôs the deal with
    server side programming? Aren‚Äôt there benefits (async et al) to offering WinRT
    in the server world as well?
