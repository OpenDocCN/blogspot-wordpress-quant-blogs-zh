- en: In other news, Alcoa (AA) released earnings Monday night. They disappointed
    and sold off a little bit on Tuesday. Alcoa’s earnings release always comes with
    great fanfare because it’s typically the first large-cap to report after the end
    of the quarter. Does it really deserve all the fanfare? Is it somehow predictive
    of how the market may perform during earnings season? I figured it was worth a
    look.

    for Alcoa. If Alcoa rose following its earnings announcement I bought the S&P
    500 and held for 25 days. If Alcoa fell following its earnings announcement I
    sold short the S&P 500 and covered 25 days later. Results below broken out by
    buys and sells:'

    as important to the market as scoring first is in a basketball game.
