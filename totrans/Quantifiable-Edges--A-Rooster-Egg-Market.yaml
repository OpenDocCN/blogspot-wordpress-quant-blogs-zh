- en: In other news, Alcoa (AA) released earnings Monday night. They disappointed
    and sold off a little bit on Tuesday. Alcoa’s earnings release always comes with
    great fanfare because it’s typically the first large-cap to report after the end
    of the quarter. Does it really deserve all the fanfare? Is it somehow predictive
    of how the market may perform during earnings season? I figured it was worth a
    look.
