- en: There is the old story about the market craze in sardine trading when the sardines
    disappeared from their traditional waters in Monterey, California. The commodity
    traders bid them up and the price of a can of sardines soared. One day a buyer
    decided to treat himself to an expensive meal and actually opened a can and started
    eating. He immediately became ill and told the seller the sardines were no good.
    The seller said, “You don’t understand. These are not eating sardines, they are
    trading sardines.”‘

    never bothering to taste the sardines they are trading. Speculation offers the
    prospect of instant gratification; why get rich slowly if you can get rich quickly?

    in consensus; those in the majority gain confidence from their very number. Today
    many financial-market participants, knowingly or unknowingly, have become speculators.
    They may not even realize that they are playing a “greater-fool game,” buying
    overvalued securities and expecting—hoping—to find someone, a greater fool, to
    buy from them at a still higher price.

    Viewing stocks this way requires neither rigorous analysis nor knowledge of the
    underlying businesses. Moreover, trading in and of itself can be exciting and,
    as long as the market is rising, lucrative. But essentially it is speculating,
    not investing.

    you have to ask yourself, "Am I looking for trading sardines, or eating sardines?"
