- en: Interesting slide deck from Capital One [comparing](http://www.slideshare.net/sbaltagi/flink-vs-spark)
    Flink vs Spark.  H2O has Spark integration though [SparkingWater](http://www.h2o.ai/product/sparkling-water/) which
    is all well and good, but Flink look more interesting 🙂

- en: Having not done much work with [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), I
    see it has its own cluster for [distribution](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.8/how_tos/distributed/index.html#distributed-tensorflow).
     However, [databricks](https://databricks.com/blog/2016/01/25/deep-learning-with-spark-and-tensorflow.html)
    has integrated it with [Spark](https://www.infoq.com/news/2016/03/databricks-spark-tensorflow).

    Data Lake.  Interesting, but not quite what I’m looking for.  However, it does
    point me at Apache [Drill](https://drill.apache.org/).

- en: “Data Lake Architecture [Considerations](http://dataottam.com/2016/02/13/data-lake-architecture-considerations-composition/)
    & Composition” provides direction on a Data Lake architecture being composed of
    three layers and three tiers.  Extremely helpful, and one of the better articles
    I’ve found on data lakes.  Probably also worth a [read](http://dataottam.com/2016/03/26/2nd-version-of-data-lake-vs-data-warehouse/)
    is “2nd Version of Data Lake vs. Data Warehouse”

    Saiki provides some thoughts on [architecture](https://tech.zalando.com/blog/apache-showdown-flink-vs.-spark/).
     Nice to see Saiki’s unified log uses Apache Kafka to feed the data lake – great
    choice 🙂
