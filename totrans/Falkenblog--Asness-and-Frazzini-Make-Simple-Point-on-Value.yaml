    ideas since the late 1990's, and as the head of a successful hedge fund, it's
    fair to say he's one of the world's foremost experts on these equity factors.
    He and Andrea Frazzini recently put up a

    for a year elsewhere (strangely, there are more downloads than abstract views).

    ratios, outperforms its opposite, growth. These studies, however, generally use
    data from December 31, to create portfolios on July 1\. This is because in the
    bad old days it was hard to get actual fiscal year ends, and some end in March,
    June, etc. Using the prior year's book value to the next July seemed like a conservative
    assumption, and matching that with market data from the same time also diminished
    some measurement issues. These value/growth portfolios would be held for 12 months,
    implying such information was 12-18 months old. Well, if you use the most recent
    data available, you can increase the value alpha by about 3% annually, which is
    quite significant.

    should handicap Dimensional, I always found a little odd.  Mystery solved.  It's
    good to know that stale data is not better than the most recent data (except when
    creating momentum factors, which you want to lag just a little bit to account
    for some really short run mean reversion).
