    be right around the corner, but I wouldn''t be surprised if we are entering a
    longer volatility lull than we have in the recent past, such as was suggested
    by the [Faux-VIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/01/challenge-to-two-things-you-think-you.html).'

    is to put on a call backspread, which I can do for a credit. I''m looking at selling
    1 of the Feb 9 calls (2.25-2.45) for every two of the Feb 11 calls (0.85-0.90)
    I buy. Another possibility is to do the trade with calls that are entirely out
    of the money: sell 1 Feb 10 (1.40-1.45) for every 2 Feb 12.5s I buy (0.45-0.55).'

    position, then watch to see if either of these two setups can be established for
    a larger credit during the day today. At current market prices, a new position
    would be profitable below 9.45 and above 12.55, with a maximum loss at 11.00\.
    Of course, profitability above 12.55 is theoretically unlimited. I will watch
    to see if these numbers get better during the course of the day.
