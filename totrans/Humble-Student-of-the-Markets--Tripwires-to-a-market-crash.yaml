    experiences severe chest pains and looks like he is headed for a heart attack
    ("Lehman moment"). The protocol is well defined in these circumstances. Take steps
    to stabilize him ("inject liquidity via the ECB") and then address the causes
    with a program of diet, exercise and medical treatment ("longer term solutions
    such as balanced budgets, pro-growth policies, possibly closer fiscal integration, two-speed
    eurozone, etc."). Berating him about being lazy and overeating ("you lazy Greeks,
    Italians...") and making him get on the treadmill to work off his Thanksgiving
    feast ("more austerity and IMF monitors") while he is on the verge of a heart
    attack ("Lehman like financial crisis") is less than helpful under the circumstances.

- en: Here are the four main "tells" that I am watching for as signs of a Lehman-like
    event. First of all, let's look at the yield on the 10-year Treasury Note as it
    is one of the bellwether safe haven plays. The 10-year yield, while it is in a
    downtrend, moved down through support on Wednesday but rallied through resistance
    (turned from support) on Friday and is now testing the downtrend line. I would
    watch for a significant violation of this initial support and if the September
    and October lows hold. If they don't it would be a definite indication that the
    "bang" moment is upon us.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The 30-year yield is looking more bearish than the 10-year yield. Unlike the
    10s, the 30-year yield broke down through initial support and it's in an obvious
    downtrend. Violation of the lows seen in September and October would be a definite
    sign of trouble.

- en: Since Italy has been the one of the sources of weakness in the eurozone, it
    would be instructive to watch the FTSE MIB Index of Italian stocks. The MIB tested
    the 2009 lows in September, rallied and it is in the process of testing that support
    level again. Violation of this key support level would be a sign that a market
    crash is coming.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, I watch the Euro STOXX 60 Index as a barometer of market stress, and
    that index is behaving better than the MIB Index in Italy. The Euro STOXX 60 is
    in decline, but watch for how it behaves at initial support offered by the September
    lows and failing that, the 2009 lows.

    will be nationalized, much of the existing debt of the European banking system
    will be restructured, and those banks will gradually be recapitalized, post-restructuring
    and at much smaller leverage ratios, through new IPOs to the market.

    some of the canaries are starting to keel over. Consider, for example, the price
    chart of Banco Santander, a large Spanish bank. SANT is in a multi-year downtrend
    that began in early 2010 and it is now testing a key support level. Violation
    of that support would be a sign of rising stress levels in eurozone banks.

    a UK-based bank that should be somewhat more insulated from stresses in the eurozone.
    Apparently, it's not that insulated as the stock has violated near term support.
    A test of the 2009 lows is next and should those lows not hold, there's going
    to be trouble.

    then what happens next to global banking funding? At which point, you can count
