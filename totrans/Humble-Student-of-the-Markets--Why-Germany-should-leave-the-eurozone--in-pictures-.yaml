- en: I thought that I would look at the long-term performance of the other major
    eurozone stock markets against the DAX. Here is Italy, which is a bellwether for
    stress within the eurozone. It's been in a relative downtrend since 2005 and there
    are no indications that there is any bottom. The downtrend has been steady, well-defined
    and not oversold on RSI.

    IBEX 35 against the DAX, which has appeared to have rallied out of its relative
    downtrend.
