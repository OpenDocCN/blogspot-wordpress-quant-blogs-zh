    to suggest some possibilities in the comments below) and one of these is a [chart
    of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week)
    that highlights what I think is a particularly salient development from the past
    week. This week, of course, there are many possibilities to draw upon, given some
    of the historic market activity. Friday’s [Citigroup implied volatility chart](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/11/international-securities-exchange.html)
    is one such example.

    flight to safety with a ratio of the VIX to the [3 month T-bill](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/3%20Month%20Treasury%20Bill)
    yield. A chart of the [VIX:IRX ratio](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%3AIRX)
    is below.

    I highlighted this same ratio in a chart going all the way back to 1990 in [Volatility
    Catastrophe Graphic](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/09/volatility-catastrophe-graphic.html).
    At that time, the VIX:IRX ratio had just exceeded 100, shattering the all-time
    high set in March when the ratio jumped to 5.3 on the heels of the Bear Stearns
    failure. This week the ratio took another quantum leap, surpassing 1600 at one
    point and closing at 726.

    VIX is only part of the story. The VIX:IRX ratio paints a much broader – and darker
    – picture of fear and the flight to safety.
