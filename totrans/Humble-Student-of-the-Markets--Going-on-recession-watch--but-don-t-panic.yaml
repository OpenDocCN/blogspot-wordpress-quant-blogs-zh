    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    "buy" signal. The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of
    the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. Past trading of
    the trading model has shown turnover rates of about 200% per month.

    on "recession watch" because of a deterioration in macro data. But don't panic.
    A "recession watch" is emphatically not a forecast of an impending slowdown, nor
    is it a forecast of an imminent bear market. Macro readings are starting to look
    a little wobbly and therefore some caution may be warranted. The scenario that
    I outlined before of a cyclical top in 2017 is playing itself out (see

    don`t necessarily agree with Goldman`s probability estimates, I do agree that
    risks are rising but they are not at levels that warrant a full-scale defensive
    portfolio position (annotations in red are mine).

    economies, and by implication the stock market.  I would further point out that
    the data began to deteriorate before the election and my change in view has little
    to do with the electoral results. Only one of the Trump proposals have an unexpected
    side-effect of exacerbating the downside vulnerability of the global economy in
    a downturn, but that effect is relatively minor.
