- en: I know that very few retail traders actively trade [VIX options](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20options),
    but for those who usually do not consider this product, I want to highlight the
    fact that because the [VIX expiration calendar](http://www.theocc.com/publications/xcal/xcal2009.pdf)
    is different from the standard third Friday of the month equity and index [expiration](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/options%20expiration)
    calendar, this weekend might be an appropriate time to think about VIX options
    as a short-term portfolio protection play.

- en: Anyone who has portfolio insurance in the form of options expiring tomorrow
    is likely concerned about what will happen over the long weekend, particularly
    with rumors about the possibility of Citigroup ([C](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/C))
    and Bank of America ([BAC](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/BAC)) being
    nationalized. One solution, of course, is to roll those January options into February
    and beyond. If, however, you do not necessarily want to buy portfolio protection
    for a full month, then you can get it through Wednesday morning with the January
    VIX options. The last trading date for January VIX options is Tuesday, January
    20^(th), with the options settled at the open on Wednesday morning.

- en: Equity futures have been trending up over night, but substantial short-term
    risks remain, with all the uncertainty over the financials, compounded by a three
    day weekend, followed by the inauguration of Barack Obama coming up on Tuesday.
    I am not going so far as to recommend the purchase of VIX calls, but I do want
    to make sure that investors with a short-term horizon are aware of the VIX options
    expiration calendar anomaly.
