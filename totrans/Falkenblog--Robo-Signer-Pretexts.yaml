    are efficient and just. As Lao Tzu noted, if you know what you want, you know
    the answer too. [However, Tzu seems to think this is a good thing, as if our authentic,
    innermost wants are better than those that come

    kulaks back in the good old days. People like Paul Krugman, who's id leads his
    superego rather directly, suggest that those signatures affirming that some person
    owns the mortgage on some property and hasn't paid, may not have had first-hand
    information to that effect. They may have been using hearsay information. This
    is the kind of legal breach is hardly a grand problem that must be addressed prior
    to further foreclosures. How many of you have clicked 'I have read the EULA agreement'
    when downloading software without actually doing so? Is that a problem?

    mortgage payment?'' If it was several months ago, the rest doesn''t matter. If
    people paid their mortgage bills, robo-signers would not be problems, and if they
    don''t pay their mortgage bills, there will be a problem. Having the servicer
    spend a day on their affidavit won''t make it any more accurate, the facts are
    pretty easy to see.'

    indignant about what my adversary was saying, because when dealing with someone
    who has bad faith, they won't be satisfied when you address their specific points.
    They would say 'this is about enforcing the law', as if a spreadsheet of the SPY
    returns since 2000, downloaded from Yahoo!, that I transferred to my home computer,
    was a violation of my confidentiality agreement. The specifics did not matter,
    it was the principle, they would say, the sanctity of contracts, the importance
    of protecting their property rights. Details being complicated, costly litigation
    commenced, which was the end game. For many people, an indefensible unstated principle
    is their end game, but because it is self-serving and petty, one can't say it
    directly. Thus, various pretexts are paraded as principle, and quickly forgotten
    once their damage has been done.
