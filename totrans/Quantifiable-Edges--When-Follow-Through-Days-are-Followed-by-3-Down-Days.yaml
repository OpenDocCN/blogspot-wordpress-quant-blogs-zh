- en: After posting a Follow-Through Day (FTD) on Tuesday, the market has now pulled
    back for 3 days in a row. Using the database of Follow-Through days from the original
    FTD study, I took a close look at short-term performance after other such post-FTD
    pullbacks. Of the 74 previous FTDs identified using the standard parameters from
    the original FTD study, 11 were immediately followed by three down days. Results
    following those instances can be found below.

- en: We see here some extremely positive stats and what appears to be a strong inclination
    for an immediate move higher. I'll also note though, that only 3 of these 11 instances
    resulted in successful intermediate-term rallies from the FTD of 3 days prior.
