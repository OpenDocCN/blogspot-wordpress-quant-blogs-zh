    to highlight in [chart of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week),
    I find the dollar’s story to be too compelling to overlook. Also, to the extent
    that this weekly chart is supposed to reflect an issue that I have been contemplating
    at some length as of late, I see the dollar as one of the key elements of the
    2010 investment puzzle.

- en: In order to get a better sense of the dollar, this week’s chart of the week
    looks at five years of weekly bars in the dollar index, which compares the dollar
    to a weighted average of a basket of foreign [currencies](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/currencies)
    that includes the [euro](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/euro), Japanese
    [yen](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Yen), British pound, Canadian
    dollar, Swedish krona and Swiss franc. Of these currencies, the euro has by far
    the largest weighting in the basket at approximately 57.6%. For this reason, concerns
    about [Dubai](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Dubai), [Greece](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Greece)
    and [Spain](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Spain) have not only significantly
    weakened the euro, but because of the euro’s weighting, have had a strong bullish
    effect on the dollar index.

- en: The chart below shows that the 79 level in the dollar index represents resistance
    in the form of converging 39 and 100 week moving averages. On startling feature
    in the chart is the 100 week moving average, which has held steadfast in the high
    78s for 16 straight months, even as the dollar index has fluctuated wildly during
    the financial crisis. Should the dollar close above 79 and take out both moving
    averages, I would have to consider it back on a bullish trajectory. For now, however,
    I am content to count the recent move as a technical bounce that has resulted
    from a series of threats to the European economy and its currency.
