    appear. The CBOE, however, was able to go back and reverse engineer the volatility
    data for 1987, using the OEX options methodology (i.e., the VXO or pre-2003 VIX.)
    The results are attached below. Keep in mind that given the slight difference
    in methodology, the VXO has historically registered at levels of about 5% higher
    than the VIX.
