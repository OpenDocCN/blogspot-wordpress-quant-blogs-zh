- en: One question I get fairly often is “Why does the number of instances decline
    when you look further out in a study?” I’ve answered it on a few occasions but
    recently realized I should make it a post.

    a 1% drop in the S&P 500.

- en: Declining instances are common with some studies - especially studies like this
    with a large number of instances. The issue has to do with repeat occurrences
    of the setup. Here we see there were 454 occurrences that showed up with a 1-day
    holding period. 77 times it happened twice in a row, so when you look at the 2-day
    exit results now your number of instances drops to 377\. Looking out 5 days the
    instances drops to 246, meaning after the 1st instance there were 208 times where
    you again had a 1% drop during the 4 days following all "initial" instances.

    you double (or triple, etc.) count them then your results will most often be skewed
    unfairly bullish. The 2nd instance you're more oversold than the 1st and the 3rd
    even more so. Now when the bounce comes it's being counted 3 times if you decide
    to track the stats on all 3.

    counting there would often skew them even more bearish.

    time it triggers it puts you "all in" and your exit will be X days later. You
    can't get another buy trigger until the first one closes out.
