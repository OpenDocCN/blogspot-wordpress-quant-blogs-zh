    quotations. As his name is Max, I titled the book 'Maxims.' With only a little
    work in formatting, I was able to create a paperback and ebook on Amazon, so that
    I basically did this for the price of the New York Times.  I made it for him,
    but you can buy it on Amazon for $5, or $3 for the Kindle version (see

    Whether our kids will agree with us is up to them, but we can hope. But as I''m
    starting to lose him to the real world, I wanted comfort that if I get hit by
    a truck, he''d have access to some quotes that can help him even if I can''t.
    So, I put a bunch of quotes (around 710) I''ve been compiling for decades into
    a book, in 7 sections: Wisdom, Purpose, Virtue, Life, Psychology, Science, Politics.
    About 15% of the quotes are unattributed, because when I wrote them down, I lost
    the source, and it doesn''t show up in a Google search (some obscure, some probably
    my artistic license).'
