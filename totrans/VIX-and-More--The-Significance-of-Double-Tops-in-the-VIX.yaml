    on the subject of VIX double tops, but given the recent double top formation in
    the VIX, I thought this might be a good time to share some of my thinking on the
    subject. First, the chart at the right shows the recent VIX levels from mid-August
    to the present. The first spike in the double top comes on October 24th and the
    most recent spike comes on November 19th.'

    coincide with extreme readings in the VIX. By contrast, VIX triple tops are relatively
    rare; and while single VIX spikes are common in more mundane market conditions,
    they are less likely to be found at VIX extremes than double tops.

    were the 1997 [Asian Financial Crisis](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Asian%20financial%20crisis),
    the 1998 [Long-Term Capital Management Crisis](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Long%20Term%20Capital%20Management),
    and the 2002 bottom of the technology bust that accompanied the [WorldCom](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/WorldCom)
    bankruptcy filing. In the graphs below, I have recorded the history of these VIX
    spikes. You can clearly see a double top pattern in the VIX in all three instances.
    Interestingly in each instance, the spikes were separated by approximately 2-3
    weeks and signaled major turning points in the markets.

    current market is fraught with danger, but I would argue that the presence of
    a VIX double top reinforces the case that the recent stock market bottom will
    prove to be an important market inflection point.
