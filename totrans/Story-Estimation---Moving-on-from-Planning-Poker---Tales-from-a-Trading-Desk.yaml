- en: Planning Poker in some cases can feel like a death spiral – especially when
    the backlog is long.  Although old, its worth recalling the InfoQ [article](http://www.infoq.com/news/2010/10/estimation-techniques),
    “Are There Better Estimation Techniques for Experienced Teams?”.  Further, again
    old, but worth a read, Magic [Estimation,](http://campey.blogspot.com.au/2010/09/magic-estimation.html)
    and more recent, [Blink](http://dannorth.net/2013/08/08/blink-estimation/) Estimation.

    are agreeing to up-front scope detail that will likely bite you on the arse later
    and restrict the customer’s ability to request changes (and yours to welcome them)
    for their competitive advantage
