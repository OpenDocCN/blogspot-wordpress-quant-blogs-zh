- en: 'closed at “10” on Tuesday (July 1st). Historically, this has been a reliable
    indication that the market is nearing a bounce. Using backtested data from 1995-2005
    and live data from 2005 forward, there have been 18 instances when the CBI reached
    at least 10\. Buying the S&P when it hit 10 and selling on a return to 3 or lower

- en: The max drawdown is important to keep in mind. A CBI of 10 is not magic. It
    doesn’t guarantee anything. It’s indicating that downside breadth is overdone.

    was also overdone. It still is. Hopefully the market does what breadth says it’s
    supposed to do soon.
