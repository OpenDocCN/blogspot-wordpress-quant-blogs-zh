    the London-based Centre for the Study of Financial Innovation to the banking crisis
    is to create “utility” banks and “casino” bank. Regulate the “utility” bank, Kay
    says, and let the “casino” bank take risks.

    riskier, long-term activities would be greatly reduced if we did adopt narrow
    banking. Against this, one might argue that, with public sector debt used to back
    the liabilities of narrow banks, investors would be forced to find other such
    assets.

    via “quasi-banks”. This is what has just happened, after all, with “shadow banking”.
    In the end, those entities, too, have been rescued. The big point is that a financial
    structure characterised by short-term and relatively risk-free liabilities and
    longer-term and riskier assets is highly profitable, until it collapses, as it
    is rather likely to do.

    financial intermediaries, other than narrow banks, would have the value of their
    liabilities dependent on the value of their assets. Where assets could not be
    valued, there would be matching lock-up periods for liabilities. The great game
    of short-term borrowing, used to purchase longer-term and risky assets, on wafer-thin
    equity, would be ruled out. The equity risk would be borne by the funds’ investors.
    Trading entities would exist. But they would need equity funding.

    the years. This is one of the rare cases where I disagree with him. The problem
    isn’t one of defining a regulatory framework for a “casino” bank, but that the
    incentives for the management of the “casino” bank are asymmetric and mis-aligned.

    short-term returns at the cost of excessive long-term event risk, let them. The
    ones with adult supervision will survive, the ones without will blow their brains
    out and their failure will serve as an example to others.
