    approach to quantitative investment management. Simons declared that total transparency
    within Renaissance Technologies is one reason of their success, and Lopez de Prado
    deemed the "production chain" (assembly line) approach the best meta-strategy
    for quantitative investment. One does not need to be a giant of the industry to
    practice team-based strategy development, but to do that well requires years of
    practice and trial and error. While this sounds no easier than developing strategies
    on your own, it is more sustainable and scalable - we as individual humans do
    get tired, overwhelmed, sick, or old sometimes. My experience in team-based strategy
    development falls into 3 categories: 1) pair-trading, 2) hiring researchers, and
    3) hiring subadvisors. Here are my thoughts.'

    I have found that to work equally well in trading research and executions, which
    gives new meaning to the term "pair trading".'

    other at the end of the day. One trader may be detail-oriented, while another
    may be bursting with ideas. One trader may be a programmer geek, and another may
    have a CFA. Here is an example. In financial data science and machine learning,
    data cleansing is a crucial step, often seriously affecting the validity of the
    final results. I am, unfortunately, often too impatient with this step, eager
    to get to the "red meat" of strategy testing. Fortunately, my colleagues at

    quite a few of my bogus strategies along the way. Speaking of invalidating strategies,
    it is crucial to have a pair-trader independently backtest a strategy before trading
    it, preferably in two different programming languages. As I have written in my

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ', I backtest with Matlab and others in my firm use Python, while the final
    implementation as a production system by my pair-trader Roger is always in C#.
    Often, subtle biases and bugs in a strategy will be revealed only at this last
    step. After the strategy is "cross-validated" by your pair-trader, and you have
    moved on to live trading, it is a good idea to have one human watching over the
    trading programs at all times, even for fully automated strategies.  (For the
    same reason, I always have my foot ready on the brake even though my car has a
    collision avoidance system.) Constant supervision requires two humans, at least,
    especially if you trade in international as well as domestic markets.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Of course, pair-trading is not just about finding bugs and monitoring live trading.
    It brings to you new ideas, techniques, strategies, or even completely new businesses.
    I have started two hedge funds in the past. In both cases, it started with me
    consulting for a client, and the consulting progressed to a collaboration, and
    the collaboration became so fruitful that we decided to start a fund to trade
    the resulting strategies.
  prefs: []

- en: For balance, I should talk about a few downsides to pair-trading. Though the
    final product's quality is usually higher, collaborative work often takes a lot
    longer. Your pair-trader's schedule may be different from yours. If the collaboration
    takes the form of a formal partnership in managing a fund or business, be careful
    not to share ultimate control of it with your pair-trading partner (sharing economic
    benefits is of course necessary). I had one of my funds shut down due to the early
    retirement of my partner. One of the reasons I started trading independently instead
    of working for a large firm is to avoid having my projects or strategies prematurely
    terminated by senior management, and having a partner involuntarily shuts you
    down is just as bad.

    is the easiest way (note this blog here). Whether you blog, tweet, quora, linkedIn,

    them to a collaboration.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Besides pair-trading with partners on a shared intellectual property basis,
    I have also hired various interns and researchers, where I own all the IP. They
    range from undergraduates to post-doctoral researchers (and I would not hesitate
    to hire talented high schoolers either.) The difference with pair-traders is that
    as the hired quants are typically more junior in experience and hence require
    more supervision, and they need to be paid a guaranteed fee instead of sharing
    profits only. Due to the guaranteed fee, the screening criterion is more important.  I
    found short interviews, even one with brain teasers, to be quite unpredictive
    of future performance (no offence, D.E. Shaw.) We settled on giving an applicant
    a tough financial data science problem to be done at their leisure. I also found
    that there is no particular advantage to being in the same physical office with
    your staff. We have worked very well with interns spanning the globe from the
    UK to Vietnam.

    is essential in working with remote researchers. Unlike with pair-traders, there
    isn't time to work together on coding with all the different researchers. But
    it is very beneficial to walk through their codes whenever results are available.
    Bugs will be detected, nuances explained, and very often, new ideas come out of
    the video meetings. We used to have a company-wide weekly video meetings where
    a researcher would present his/her results using Powerpoints, but I have found
    that kind of high level presentation to be less useful than an in-depth code and
    result review. Powerpoint presentations are also much more time-consuming to prepare,
    whereas a code walk-through needs little preparation.

    on their own. But that is not necessarily the most productive use of their talent
    for the firm. It is rare to be able to develop and complete a trading strategy
    using machine learning within a summer internship. Also, if the goal of the strategy
    is to be traded as an independent managed account product (e.g. our

    the other hand, we can often see immediate benefits from improving an existing
    strategy, and the improvement can be researched within 3 or 4 months. This also
    fits within the "production chain" meta-strategy described by Lopez de Prado above,
    where each quant should mainly focus on one aspect of the strategy production.

    but don't have time to. This would generally be the reason to hire undergraduate
    interns. But sometimes, I hire  people who are better than I am at something.
    For example, despite my theoretical physics background, my stochastic calculus
    isn't top notch (to put it mildly). This is remedied by hiring our postdoc Ray
    who found tedious mathematics a joy rather than a drudgery. While undergraduate
    interns improve our productivity, graduate and post-doctoral researchers are generally
    able to break new ground for us. For these quants, they require more freedom to
    pursue their projects, but that doesn't mean we can skip the code reviews and
    weekly video conferences, just like what we do with pair-traders.

    using professional recruiters. In contrast, these hires generally found their
    way to us, despite our minuscule size. That is because I am known as an educator
    (both formally as adjunct faculty in universities, as well as informally on social
    media and through books). Everybody likes to be educated while getting paid. If
    you develop a reputation of being an educator in the broadest sense, you shall
    find recruits coming to you too.

    returns on investment, finding subadvisors to trade your account isn't a bad option.
    After all, creating IP takes a lot of time and money, and finding a profitable
    subadvisor will generate that cash flow and diversify your portfolio and revenue
    stream while you are patiently doing research. (In contrast to Silicon Valley
    startups where the cash for IP creation comes from venture capital, cash flow
    for hedge funds like ours comes mainly from fees and expense reimbursements, which
    are quite limited unless the fund is large or very profitable.)

    deep drawdown typically immediately began once we hired them. There is a name
    for this: it is called selection bias. If you generate 100 geometric random walks

    than "emerging" subadvisors. But these subadvisors typically charge the full 2
    and 20 fees, and the more profitable ones may charge even more. Some investors
    balk at those high fees. I think these investors suffer from a behavioral finance
    bias, which for lack of a better term I will call "Scrooge syndrome". Suppose
    one owns Amazon's stock that went up 92461% since IPO. Does one begrudge Jeff
    Bezo's wealth? Does one begrudge the many millions he rake in every day? No, the
    typical investor only cares about the net returns on equity. So why does this
    investor suddenly becomes so concerned with the difference between gross and net
    return of a subadvisor? As long as the net return is attractive, we shouldn't
    care how much fees the subadvisor is raking in. Renaissance Technologies' Medallion
    Fund reportedly charges 5 and 44, but most people would jump at the chance of
    investing if they were allowed.

    That is another behavioral bias, which is known as the "NIH syndrome" (Not Invented

    in creating the iPhone at Apple, why should they feel diminished paying for a
    service that generates uncorrelated returns? Do they think they alone can create
    every new strategy ever discoverable by humankind?
