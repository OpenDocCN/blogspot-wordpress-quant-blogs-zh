    bank index ([BKX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/BKX)) or one of
    the individual bank that seems to be floundering even more than its peers, this
    is what I did with Bank of America ([BAC](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/BAC))
    in last week’s [chart of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week).
    The story has not changed much this week, except that the picture has become even
    uglier.

    According to data from the Investment Company Institute, cash in money market
    mutual funds jumped over 45% from August 2007 through last week, when it reached
    an all-time high. The chart below shows how cash on the sidelines has increased
    dramatically since last October, leaving less fuel to keep the S&P 500 index aloft.
    During the past week the ICI reported the first meaningful drop in money market
    mutual fund cash levels since September and also only the second time in 16 weeks
    that cash levels have dropped for institutional investors.

    signs of a change in trend, then this will almost certainly have significant bullish
    implications for equities.
