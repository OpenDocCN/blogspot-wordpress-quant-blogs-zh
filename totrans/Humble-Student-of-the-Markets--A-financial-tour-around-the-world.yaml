    Let`s start with the United States. As the chart below shows, the SPX has staged
    an upside break and moved to all-time highs. While other indices, such as the
    NASDAQ and small cap Russell 2000 have not broken out to new highs, the upside
    breakout by the SPX remains impressive, though a little extended and may need
    some consolidation.

    monolithic. In particular, these markets are split into eurozone and non-eurozone
    economies. The latter group consists of countries that can chart a somewhat independent
    monetary policy, such as Switzerland and the UK, and others that have not adopted
    the euro but remain under the sway of the ECB, such as Denmark and many of the
    eastern European countries. Switzerland, the first independent (recall how fiercely
    the SNB defended the 1.20 exchange rate level), has shown a breakout-pullback
    pattern, with the Swiss index staging an upside breakout and pulling back to test
    support near the former breakout level:'

    markets as it has not staged an upside breakout as it is just testing a long-term

    as being in an uptrend.

    the recovery, followed by Europe and with China bringing up the rear. There appears
    to be little sign of any developed market recession around the corner, so that
