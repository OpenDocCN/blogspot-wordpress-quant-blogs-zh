- en: 'I am Mr. Hank Paulson. A TREASURER of THE AMERICAN STATES(USA). I have the
    courage to Crave indulgence for this important business believing that you will
    never let me down either now or in the future. Some years ago, a Federal Reserve
    President commissioned a study that argued for enhanced mortgage technology to
    help the poor. It lent out 1,000,000,000,000,000.00 USD to assist in this matter,
    with innovative underwriting standards such as NINJA and Section 203(b) loans.
    This worked for almost a decade, but this time, upon maturity, the bank sent routine
    notifications to the various forwarding addresses but got few replies. After a
    year, the bank sent more reminders and finally contracted their companies, such
    as the FANNIE MAY, FREDDIE MAC, and THE BEARS STERN CORPORATION, among others,
    who all wrote to inform the bank that they all died without MAKING A WILL, and
    all attempts by the bank to trace the next of kin were fruitless. I therefore,
    made further investigation and discovered that the beneficiary was a single immigrant
    from Nigeria who had only recently obtained American citizenship. He did not declare
    any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank deposit
    paper work. Some idiots actually made payments on their mortgages, so that there
    is a remaining money total amount of $700B.USD (SEVEN HUNDRED BILLION US DOLLARS)
    still sitting in my bank as dormant Account. No one will ever come forward to
    claim it, and according to American Banking policy, after some years, the money
    will revert to the ownership of the AMERICAN Government if those account owners
    are certified dead. This is the situation, and my proposal that we buy it first,
    for the current price of $700B.USD, which is well below its market price of $17.6T.USD
    (as calculated by my cousin, the Honorable Benjamin Bernanke, Chief of Federal
    Reserve). All you have to do is write a blank check or give me your account anywhere
    in the world and send me its detail for me to arrange the proper money transfer
    paperwork, and facilitate the transfer. Once we buy the debt at cheap prices,
    my old colleagues at THE GOLDMAN SACKS company will most assuredly buy it from
    us for at least $2.3T within a couple year. The money will then be paid into the
    Account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me, 35 %for you and 5% for expenses
    that might come up during transfer process. There is no risk at all, and all the
    paper work for this transaction will be done by me using my position and connections
    in the banks in America. This business transaction is guaranteed.And the first
    phase of the transfer will be ($100B.USD) ONE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS as advised
    by our insider in the bank. If you are interested, please reply immediately through
    my personal email sending the following details: (1) Your Full Name/Address (2)
    Your Private Telephone/fax Number (3) Bank Name (4) Account Number(s) (5) Bank
    Routing Number(s). Please observe the utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured
    that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall
    require your assistance to invest some of my share in your country. I look forward
    to your earliest reply.'

  zh: 我是汉克·保尔森先生。我是美利坚合众国（美国）的财政部长。我有勇气请求您对这项重要的业务予以关注，相信您现在或将来都不会让我失望。几年前，一位联邦储备银行行长委托进行了一项研究，认为应加强抵押贷款技术以帮助穷人。它贷出了1,000,000,000,000,000.00美元来协助此事，采用了创新的贷款标准，如NINJA和203(b)款。这个方案运作了近十年，但到期时，银行向各个转发地址发送了例行通知，但收到的答复很少。一年后，银行发送了更多的提醒，最后联系了他们的公司，如FANNIE
    MAY、FREDDIE MAC和THE BEARS STERN CORPORATION等，他们都写信通知银行他们都没有留下遗嘱而去世了，并且银行追踪下一个亲属的所有尝试都无功而返。因此，我进行了进一步调查，发现受益人是一名从尼日利亚移民过来的单身移民，他最近才获得了美国公民身份。他在所有官方文件中都没有声明任何亲属或关系，包括他的银行存款文件。一些白痴实际上支付了他们的抵押贷款，所以我的银行仍然有着$700B.USD（七千亿美元）的未动用账户金额。没有人会站出来要求它，根据美国银行政策，几年后，如果这些账户的所有者被确认死亡，这些钱将归还给美国政府所有。这就是情况，我的建议是我们首先以7000亿美元的价格购买它，这远低于其市场价格17.6万亿美元（由我表弟、联邦储备系统主席本杰明·伯南克计算得出）。您需要做的就是写一张空白支票或者提供您在世界任何地方的账户，并将其详细信息发送给我，以便我安排适当的资金转移文件，并促成转移。一旦我们以便宜的价格购买了债务，我在高盛公司的老同事们肯定会在几年内以至少2.3万亿美元的价格从我们这里购买它。这笔钱将会支付到账户中，以我们60%的比例分享，您35%的比例分享，以及在转移过程中可能出现的5%的费用。这完全没有风险，所有此交易的文件工作将由我使用我的地位和与美国银行的联系完成。此业务交易已得到保证。转移的第一阶段将是（1000亿美元）一千亿美元，根据我们在银行内部人士的建议。如果您有兴趣，请立即通过我的个人电子邮件回复，发送以下详细信息：（1）您的全名/地址（2）您的私人电话/传真号码（3）银行名称（4）账户号码（5）银行路由号码。请注意最严格的保密，并且请放心，这项交易对我们两人都将是最有利可图的，因为我将需要您的帮助来在您的国家投资一些我的份额。我期待着您的早日回复。
