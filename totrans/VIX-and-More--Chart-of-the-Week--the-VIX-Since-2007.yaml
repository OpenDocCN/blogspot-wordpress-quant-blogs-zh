    was such a huge hit two weeks ago that I thought it would be appropriate to address
    all the angst about low readings in the VIX with a chart of the CBOE Volatility
    Index (yes, the VIX does have a formal name) that stretches back to the beginning
    of 2007 and incorporates the 2007 peak in stocks, the 2008 panic, the 2009 bottom
    and the rally that has dominated the past two years.'

    chart of [VIX macro cycles](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20macro%20cycles)
    and the like utilize monthly bars, this time around I am pulling back to a perspective
    which utilized weekly bars for the VIX. Personally, I like weekly bars because
    it removes the weekend effect or ‘[calendar reversion](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/calendar%20reversion)’
    as I like to call it. More importantly, I plan my trading and execute my strategies
    in weekly time chunks, hence the weekly [subscriber newsletter](http://vixandmoresubscriber.blogspot.com/).

    seen that uses weekly [moving average envelopes](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/moving%20average%20envelopes)
    (MAEs) for the VIX. In this particular variation, I have used MAEs that cover
    13 weeks (one quarter) of VIX data and plotted an envelope which extends 20% above
    and below that 13-week moving average. The result is a chart which does a good
    job of capturing outliers that are generally high probability fade trades.

    at a level not seen since July 2007, which is, ironically, just about the time
    that [Adam Warner](http://www.dailyoptionsreport.com/) and I had the bright idea
    to estimate where volatility was going to be. *[See [Volatility Aces Bloggers](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/07/volatility-aces-bloggers.html)
    for the gory details.]*

- en: Getting back to the moving average envelopes, current VIX levels are relatively
    low in absolute terms, but with the bottom of the weekly 13-20 moving average
    envelope currently at 14.63, the risk of the VIX punching through the lower envelope
    appears to be extremely low, at least to this observer.

- en: My best guess is that the next piercing of the envelope is more likely to be
    associated with a rising VIX than a falling one, but even that scenario may take
    a while to play out.
