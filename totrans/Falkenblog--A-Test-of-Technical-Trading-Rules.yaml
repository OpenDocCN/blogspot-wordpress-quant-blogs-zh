    is they test 5000 trading rules, which is a lot.

    the ratio of good to bad technical rules should be near zero regardless. That
    is, consider the concept of infinity, where the

    than that (say, Aleph 3). The ratio of Aleph null to Aleph 3 is 0\. So even if
    there are an infinite number of good trading rules, the number of bad trading
    rules is infinitely greater, the ratio is zero. Thus, this test is biased towards
    rejection.

- en: With 5000 trading rules, I imagine only say 20 worked, and so 20/5000 is not
    statistically significant. I don't know exactly how to account for this, but it
    highlights the importance of theory, because without a theory, your search space
    will either find null or positive results depending on how you construct the sample.
