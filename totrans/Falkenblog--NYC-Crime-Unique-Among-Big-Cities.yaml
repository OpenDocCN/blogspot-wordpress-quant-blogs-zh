    the criminal system behind it. He notes that unlike other majors cities, NYC has
    been lowering its crime rate while lowering its prison population. Thus, the payoff
    seems to be in police on the streets, not judges or prison cells.'

    for criminals to live there. Manhattan is one of the highest-income places in
    the United States with a population greater than 1 million. I don't see how an
    area, where the downtown boasts an incredible density of $200k/year households,
    its somehow relevant for Los Angeles, which is large, but much less dense or wealthy.
    In this case, NYC is the exception, not the rule. Look at the cities of Philadelphia,
    Cleveland, Dallas, etc., but to highlight New York, the largest collection of
    wealthy people in North America, is simply like using Lance Armstrong as the case
    study for cancer patients.

- en: 'I''m not saying poor people are morally worse than rich people, merely, they
    commit more violent and property crime, which is what we mainly look at. Indeed,
    true cowardice is at least as common among the wealthy as the poor, and their
    ethics a bit like post-modern science: whatever is good for them, rationalized
    very articulately. Thus, those that use their education and intelligence to defend
    the indefensible, the immoral, the cruel, are more pathetic than your average
    whore or crack dealer, because their intellect gives them power to do more harm
    to more people (think of Noam Chomsky defending Pol Pot in the 1970''s). But,
    given the issues of day-to-day mischief, noise, and violence, I''d rather live
    next to a hedge fund lawyer than a crack dealer even though they probably have
    equal chances of reaching heaven.'
