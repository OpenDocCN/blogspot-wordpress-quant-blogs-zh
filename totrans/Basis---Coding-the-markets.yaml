- en: I always wondered why basis trades were called basis trades. Trust [Harris](http://www-rcf.usc.edu/~lharris/)
    to provide an explanation. In [Trading & Exchanges](http://tradingandexchanges.com/),
    he describes how in the US commodities markets, the difference between the Chicago
    wheat futures price and a local cash wheat price is the *local basis*. The futures
    price is the base price, and the difference with the cash price, the basis, reflects
    the cost of shipping the grain to the Chicago delivery point specified by the
    futures contract.

    a cash bond leg. Basis for EuroGovies is quoted on [BrokerTec](http://www.icap.com/e-broking/brokertec/).
    An example trade would be buying the Sep 06 Eurex Bund futures contract, and selling
    one of the deliverable bonds for that contract.

    the bond for its later delivery. To buy the bond I need to borrow cash, which
    will cost me interest payments. That''s the funding cost of the hedge. However,
    I will also earn the coupon payments on the bond – the accrued interest. So in
    this example, the equivalent of the wheat shipping cost is hedge cost: the cost
    of funding minus accrued interest. When a trader judges that bond and future prices
    are out of line, they''ll exploit that with basis trades. And BrokerTec is one
    place they can do both legs as a single trade.'
