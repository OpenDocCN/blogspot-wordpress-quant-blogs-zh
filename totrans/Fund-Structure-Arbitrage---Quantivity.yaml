    money management styles of [Kelly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Larry_Kelly,_Jr)
    and [Soros](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soros) reminds Quantivity of the perverse
    incentives which plague the financial services industry—retail investors have
    nobody with whom their incentives are perfectly aligned; instead, everyone takes
    a piece. Yet, rather than bemoan this state of affairs, more interesting is to
    pose the following comparative advantage question:'

    own money (whether retail or prop), have over funds?

- en: Understanding this question naturally leads to the concept of *fund structure
    arbitrage*, which refers to potential profit earned by exploiting idiosyncrasies
    arising from the organizational and regulatory constraints imposed on institutional
    funds. This concept is important, as many novice traders make the mistake of dreaming
    up strategies in a vacuum, forgetting that what moves markets is big institutional
    money—much of which behaves with fairly predictable behavioral and statistical
    biases. For those who enjoy biological analogies, this is the study of [pilot
    fish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_fish).
