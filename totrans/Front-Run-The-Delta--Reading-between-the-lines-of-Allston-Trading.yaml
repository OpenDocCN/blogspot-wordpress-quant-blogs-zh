    a trade for a while on the energy desk, a very basic spreading trade, between
    the physical and the cash delivered crude. We automated a trade that one of our
    guys was running by hand (point-and-click). Then we ran them side by side.  Guess
    what? He was consistently making money when I was losing money. When we looked
    into it, we discovered he was actually making money because he was slower...'

    of those choppy markets and it was dumping position at our slippage tolerance. 
    But when trading manually he wasn''t able to see every tick update and react to
    every little move so he was missing the market going against him and getting filled
    on his hedge when the market was coming back. He wasn''t dumping as quickly, and
    that was working to his advantage. Some might say he was more risky because he
    wasn''t reacting fast enough and some might say he was more profitable because
    of it.'
