    seemed to me that this is just a trick to advance redistribution under a different
    mechanism, because first you conflate insurance with health care, then start regulating
    in such a way that everyone is treated the same by the insurer regardless of the
    riskiness of the insured. In such a system, low risk people will try to opt out
    entirely or form groups that exclude high risk people (say, by having a company
    of young healthy people form a self-insurance plan).

    be really hard. If it turns out to be impossible--well, then, the ACA system will
    lurch toward pay-or-play and then single-payer.

    with diabetes will cost more than a healthy person actuarily, and healthy people
    understand that and try to avoid being in their group. The only way to avoid this
    is to use force, and so like public schools or postage, have everyone charged
    the same, and queue the same.

    that if you make positive rights equal, then everyone has an incentive to free

    like the old Soviet Union or China, it was not as if there was ever euality of
    positive rights. As H.L.Mencken noted:'
