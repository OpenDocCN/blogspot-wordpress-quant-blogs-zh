# VIX and More: VIX:VXV Ratio Signals a Buy

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/02/vixvxv-ratio-signals-buy.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/02/vixvxv-ratio-signals-buy.html#0001-01-01)

The [VIX:VXV ratio](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%3AVXV), which has been decidedly neutral for more than two months, is up over 1.08 (was at 1.10 earlier), signaling a buy.

Officially, this ratio does not generate a buy or sell signal until the end of the day, but on days like today, it is always nice to get an early warning signal.

If all hell does not break lose, I will revisit the VIX:VXV ratio just before the close and update the signal, if any.
