- en: Exactly three weeks ago today, I thought I would break some news on an intraday
    basis with a post that I titled, [Record VIX Options Volume and Large Purchases
    of VIX Calls](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2013/02/record-vix-options-volume-and-large.html).
    As it turns out, by the time the day’s total volume was tallied, February 26^(th)
    turned out to be an all-time record for [VIX options](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20options)
    volume in general and [VIX calls](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20calls)
    in particular.

  zh: 正好三周前的今天，我本以为我会通过一篇题为[Record VIX Options Volume and Large Purchases of VIX Calls](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2013/02/record-vix-options-volume-and-large.html)的文章在日内break
    some news。结果，当日的总成交量统计出来后，2月26日创下了[VIX期权](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20options)总体成交量和[VIX看涨期权](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20calls)的成交量的历史记录。
- en: The events of three weeks ago now look a little less impressive in light of
    today’s new record in VIX call volume. Truth be told, VIX options seem to be attracting
    the attention of a new group of investors. In fact, during the [CBOE Risk Management
    Conference](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2013/03/some-thoughts-on-cboe-rmc.html)
    earlier this month, there was a great deal of speculation surrounding who some
    of the new players in the VIX space might be that are responsible for the new
    growth in [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures)
    and VIX options that appears to be independent of the volume driven by [VIX ETPs](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20ETN). 
    *[Hedge funds, proprietary trading firms, commodity trading pools/advisors, insurance
    companies, bond traders, FX traders and others were among the names that were
    bandied about…]*

  zh: 三周前的事件在今日VIX看涨期权成交量的新纪录面前看起来有点不那么令人印象深刻了。事实上，VIX期权似乎正吸引着一群新的投资者的注意。事实上，在本月早些时候的[CBOE风险管理会议](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2013/03/some-thoughts-on-cboe-rmc.html)上，有很多关于谁可能是负责VIX领域新增长（似乎与[VIX
    ETPs](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20ETN)驱动的成交量无关）的[VIX期货](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures)和VIX期权的新的参与者的猜测。*[对冲基金、
    proprietary trading firms、commodity trading pools/advisors、保险公司、债券交易员、外汇交易员和其他机构都是被提及的名字...]*
- en: As is typically the case with the VIX, call volume outpaced put volume by a
    substantial margin. Today the call to put ratio was about 2.2 to 1, slightly higher
    than the average of 1.9 to 1\. That being said, put buyers appeared to be a little
    more aggressive than call buyers, with 42% of all puts bought on the ask, as opposed
    to 30% of the calls, according to data provided by [LivevolPro](http://www.livevolpro.com/).

  zh: 正如VIX通常的情况一样，今日看涨期权成交量远远超过了看跌期权成交量。今日看涨与看跌之比约为2.2比1，略高于平均的1.9比1。话说回来，根据[LivevolPro](http://www.livevolpro.com/)提供的数据，看跌买家的积极性似乎比看涨买家稍高一些，因为有42%的看跌期权是在要价买入，而看涨期权的这一比例是30%。
- en: Investors are always looking for an interpretive overlay for these VIX options
    transactions. Frankly, on the day before the March VIX expiration, a great deal
    of the options activity is the result of large investors closing out March positions
    or attempting to game the special opening quotation ([VIX SOQ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20SOQ))
    from tomorrow’s open that establishes the settlement price for VIX options and
    futures.  As a result of that low signal to noise ratio, the day prior to expiration
    is generally not a productive time for reading options entrails, though there
    will no doubt be some who are hell-bent on some sort of options divination regardless
    of where we are in the VIX expiration cycle.  For today at least, I would suggest
    that the links below might bear more fruit.

  zh: 投资者总是在寻找对这些VIX期权交易的解释性覆盖。坦白说，在3月份VIX到期前一天，大部分期权活动都是大投资者在平仓3月份的仓位或试图影响明天开盘的特殊报价（[VIX
    SOQ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20SOQ)），从而为VIX期权和期货设定结算价。由于这种低信噪比，到期前一天通常不是解读期权细节的高效时间，尽管我们处于VIX到期周的哪个阶段，肯定有一些人热衷于某种期权占卜。至少今天，我建议下面的链接可能会更有成果。
