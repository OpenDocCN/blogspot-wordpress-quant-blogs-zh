    In fact, today established a new record for the smallest (in percentage terms)
    intraday range for the VIX, a mere 1.14%.

- en: The chart below includes weekly bars and dates from January 2003.  It puts the
    prior small range day into context with a green arrow marking the previous record.
    For those who are more curious about historical precedent, in the month or so
    following the old record, the VIX slowly drifted up from 18.63 to the 22s, briefly
    touching over 23 on one day. Then, of course, the influence of the bull market
    took over and a VIX of 25 was not seen until 2007.
