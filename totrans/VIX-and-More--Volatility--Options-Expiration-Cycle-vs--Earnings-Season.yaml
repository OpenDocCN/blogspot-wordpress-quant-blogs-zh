    the weather four months in advance based on current data hits closer to home.

    temperature at some future date. If, for some odd reason, the temperature in south
    Florida reaches 120 degrees on October 5, that does not help someone to predict
    the temperature on February 5 of next year. Perhaps, if there a string of 120-degree
    days, then, maybe, there could be a trend that might presage a warmer winter and
    a higher than normal temperature on February. Under normal conditions, however,
    what happens to the temperature on one particular day in September bears very
    little relationship to what weather will be in February."*'

    Since the VIX is looking ahead to volatility over the next 30 days, it is important
    to know when the S&P500 heavyweights are scheduled to report.

    reporting season, with the most companies reporting (115), while the weeks before,
    during and after options expiration have a roughly equivalent number of companies
    in the SPX reporting during the four week window that roughly coincides with the
    VIX futures calculation horizon.

    and October) and compared them with the other eight non-earnings months. I did
    this for the week after expiration, which happened to show the highest volatility
    in my previous analysis. Sure enough, the earnings months were 50% more likely
    than non-earnings months to show VIX moves to the upside of 10% or 15% and more
    than twice as likely to show moves of 20% or more.

    volatility week, it turns out that in non-earnings months, the week after options
    expiration is no more volatile than average. The bottom line is that, as far as
    I can tell, it is the proximity to earnings releases that makes the week after
    options expiration more volatile than other weeks. Perhaps more importantly, in
    terms of the influence on volatility, earnings season trumps the options expiration
    cycle by a large margin.
