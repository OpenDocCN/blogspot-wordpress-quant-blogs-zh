    the relationship is in shambles and on the verge of collapse. Insiders know that
    the couple have a long history together are deeply committed to the marriage.

    Europe, along with the huge investment of the elite in that project. This enormously
    important motivation is often underestimated by outsiders. While the eurozone
    is not a country, it is much more than a currency union. ***For Germany, much
    the most important member, the eurozone is the capstone of a process of integration
    with its neighbours that has helped bring stability and prosperity after the disasters
    of the first half of the 20th century.*** The stakes for important member countries
    are huge.

    Europe and the world. The political elites of member states and much of their
    population continue to believe in the postwar agenda, if not as passionately as
    before. In more narrowly economic terms, few believe that currency flexibility
    would help. Many continue to believe that devaluations would merely generate higher
    inflation.

    But it is far more than such a marriage, even if it will remain far less than
    a federal union. Outsiders should not underestimate the strength of the will behind
    it.

    decided "never again". In the 200 years preceding that war, Europe had been wracked
    by conflict (WW II, WW I, Franco-Prussian War, Napoleonic Wars) and the main source
    of conflict was between France and Germany, or the Germanic states before their
    unification. When Western Europe said "never again", they devised a solution that
    bound the French and the Germans so tightly that the devastation of war on the
    European Continent would be stifled, hopefully forever. That solution was the
    EC, which became the EEC and now the EU.

    the Bundeswehr and told the troops, "We are going to war against the French",
    the men would all laugh and go home. Compare that result to the cost of the [Battle
    of Verdun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Verdun) of 300K dead and another
    500K+ wounded and you will start to understand why the EU was formed.

    that the eurocrats will eventually take steps to take tail-risk off the table,
    just as the ECB did with LTRO. That's why I believe in buying Spanish equities
    and banks at the point of maximum pain in anticipation of a rebound.
