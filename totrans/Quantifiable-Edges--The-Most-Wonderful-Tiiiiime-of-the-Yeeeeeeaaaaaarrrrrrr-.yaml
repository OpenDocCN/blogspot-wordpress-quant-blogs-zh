- en: Over several time horizons op-ex week in December has been the most bullish
    week of the year for the SPX.  The positive seasonality actually has persisted
    for up to 3 weeks.  Below are the results since SPX options began trading in 1984\.
     I have shown this table every year since 2008, and have updated the results again
    this year.

    December Opex Week!
