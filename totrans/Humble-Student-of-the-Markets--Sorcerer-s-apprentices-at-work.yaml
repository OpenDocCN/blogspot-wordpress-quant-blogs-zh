    techniques, all on the back of faulty quantitative models, it would be useful
    to re-examine the foundations of quantitative finance.

    reply that it’s because of Girsanov’s theorem.”'

    drive. When I first learned to drive, we began with theory such as the rules of
    the road, e.g. when to signal, etc. I then proceeded to a simulator and then into
    a car. In my first hour in the car, all I was expected to do was to drive straight.
    No one expected me to merge or change three lanes and head for an exit in 60 mph
    freeway traffic.

    bags of various designs helped to mitigate the effects of a crash. As well, borrowing
    from the aircraft cockpits, fancy systems such as cockpit management systems and
    HUD (heads up displays) helped the driver with his situational awareness.

    your son or daughter in a school bus driven by a ten-year-old, no matter what
    kind of cockpit management systems, collision avoidance and mitigation systems
    and other technology it has?

    and some forms of risk analysis. However, they can experience catastrophic failure
    at the level of capturing system wide risks and dynamics. For that, you need adult
    supervision.**
