- en: I have been busy with getting to know **[Algodeal](https://beta.algodeal.com/)** on
    these days. **Algodeal** is an automated trading strategy online platform. This
    project is relatively new, and it doesn’t seem to be well-known, yet. Googling
    ‘algodeal’ actually returns less than 7000 internet pages.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As the **Algodeal** website reads it offers an infrastructure for designing,
    backtesting and analysing quant strategies.

- en: '**Algodeal** provides a development environment called **Market Runner**, the
    prevailing programming language being **Java**. Among other things, the **Algodeal**
    team gives some help on how to install and use **Eclipse** and **NetBeans** together
    with their envronment. A series of tutorials, sample code examples, and various
    code snippets are provided as well.'

- en: Actually, one can work on his home machine or send out its code to the **Algodeal**
    servers. And, one can develop strategies without  even using **Market Runner**.

    case  – is as follows :'

    graphs … ) from the grid of **Algodeal**.

    use for *real* trading.  It will make *real* money, and we would receive part
    of the returns.

- en: Some disagree with the fact that the returns from the real investments made
    based on the strategies submitted by the users are shared together with **Algodeal**.
    I am not going to spend much time at debating. The **Algodeal** project seems
    fair to me as it provides with a *free* online grid, time series, a development
    environment, **Java** classes … Moreover – and, not the least – I do not put my
    own money at stake.
