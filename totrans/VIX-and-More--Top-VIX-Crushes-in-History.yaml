- en: Since I have never seen any data related to the VIX and volatility crushes before,
    I thought this might be an opportunity to present some of my data and talk about
    the findings.  In the chart below, I have captured the 25 largest one-day declines
    in the VIX since 1990 and have presented data showing the forward performance
    of the SPX in periods from one to 100 days and I have also added some brief commentary
    regarding the causes.  In some cases I link the volatility crush to a previous
    VIX spike and use some explanatory shorthand in the process.  For instance, the
    top crush day, May 10, 2010, followed 2 days after the 21

    which I cannot find any obvious explanatory catalyst – to the extent that a 0.04%
    in stocks can actually have a catalyst – but given the proximity to the upcoming
    Gulf War, my guess is that some sort of news related to Iraq played into this
    event.

    of the top 25 VIX crushes managed to eclipse the 30% decline level.  Also note
    the differences in the mean reversion predictive value of spikes versus crushes. 
    In general, the performance of the SPX following VIX crushes is modestly lower
    than that of the SPX in general.  On the other hand, the performance of the SPX
    following VIX spikes is generally better than the SPX in general – much more so
    if the September 29, 2008 outlier is dropped from the data set.

    the volatility space.  The critical data point is that 11/25 of the top 25 VIX
    crushes happened since the beginning 2010, while 14/25 of the top 25 VIX spikes
    have occurred during the same period.  This means that we have had as much in
    the way of big volatility moves in the list seven years as in the previous twenty
    years of VIX data.  In other words, the volatility landscape is changing and the
