    particular is the subject of how to blend volatility exposure – both long and
    short – into a portfolio.

- en: It is worth noting that issuers of exchange-traded products have taken several
    approaches to addressing volatility. The most obvious was the launch of [VIX-based
    ETPs](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20ETN), such as the popular
    [VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX) (iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term
    Futures ETN,) which is a long basket of short-term [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures).

    2^(nd) high, it is reasonable to ask how these approaches have been performing
    during this bearish phase. The chart below shows the performance of SPY in red.
    Two of the approaches employed have had a performance trajectory that is almost
    indistinguishable from that of SPY: VQT (green line); and VSPY (dark blue line),
    which is thinly traded.'

    XVZ (purple line). You can see from the graphic that SPLV has done exactly was
    it is supposed to do: minimize volatility. For the better part of the period in
    question, SPLV has been largely unchanged. Lately it has risen largely due to
    its substantial exposure to utilities and consumer staples. The other standout
    is XVZ, which essentially uses the slope of VIX futures [term structure](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/term%20structure)
    to determine how it allocates between long and short volatility positions. With
    the VIX futures in [contango](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/contango)
    (front months less expensive than more distant months) since last November, this
    product has been able to capitalize on negative [roll yield](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/roll%20yield),
    while also providing protection against a spike in the VIX.'

    [hedges](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/hedging) or even speculative
    applications going forward, today is definitely a case where past performance
    should not serve as a guideline for what to expect in the next week or two.

- en: For those who are looking for more powerful VIX hedges, long positions in VIX
    calls and VXX calls (including the weeklys) will provide the most robust long
    volatility hedges. For those who are looking to minimize portfolio volatility
    going forward, the four approaches outlined above (as well as the links below)
    should warrant further investigation.
