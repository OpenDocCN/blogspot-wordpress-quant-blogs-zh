- en: For readers interested in getting signals and analytics on hundreds of ETFs
    and individual stocks our Investor IQ website is currently live and free during
    our beta-testing phase. We will be adding new data and analytics gradually over
    time as well as improving website functionality. The Economic Model is currently
    hosted on the site and predictions are updated every 2-3 days in real-time. Subscribers
    will soon receive access to backtests on the economic model (I have received plenty
    of requests) and other research unique to the website. For the time being we will
    continue to publish Investor IQ on this blog with limited functionality on a weekly
    basis for our readers so be sure to sign up to the website as soon as you can!
