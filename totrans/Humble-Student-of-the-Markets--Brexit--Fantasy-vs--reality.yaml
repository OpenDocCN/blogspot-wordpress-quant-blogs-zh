    over are very unhappy about what’s going on. If you read history, there are a
    lot of similarities between now and the 1920s and ’30s. That’s when fascism and
    communism broke out in much of the world. And a lot of the same issues are popping
    up again.

    of events. It’s also an important turning point because it now means the central
    banks are going to print even more money. That may prop the markets up in the

    Britain voted to leave, and France could very well be next. Why France? One of
    the main reasons is because the French economy is softer than the German economy.
    At least in Germany people are still earning money and making a living, despite
    all the recent turmoil. In France, the same malaise that’s settling over the U.S.
    and other places is settling in. And it’s going to spread.

    year, or even the next. I can’t give a specific date. But imbalances are building
    up to such a degree, they just can’t continue much longer.
