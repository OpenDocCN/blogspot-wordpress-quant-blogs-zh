## Vista SP1 Installed

Installlation of [Vista SP1](http://www.winsupersite.com/faq/vista_sp1.asp) (434Mb) went fine, but it was a long process, with 2-3 reboots. Anyway I‚Äôm now running with the [new](http://apcmag.com/7960/microsoft_replaces_the_vista_kernel_in_SP1) [kernel](http://techreport.com/discussions.x/14074) (6.0.6001), so hopefully the blue screens I sometimes seen on bootup will disappear üôÇ
