- en: LiquidityHub have a [new website](http://www.liquidityhub.com) up. Definitely
    an improvement on the last effort. Of interest to coders will be the [tech page](http://www.liquidityhub.com/about_technology.html),
    detailing the various Java products used as building blocks. Notable are the Cameron
    FIX gateway, BEA servers and Fiorano messaging. Using Cameron to present a FIX
    wire protocol to dealers is a moot point since most talk to LH via the ION MarketView
    gateway which hides the FIX implementation. The BEA app server comes with a [real
    time VM](http://dev2dev.bea.com/pub/a/2006/04/introduction-wlrt.html) – which
    will be a relief to any dealer technologists worried about garbage collection
    delaying their streaming quotes. [Fiorano](http://www.fiorano.com) is a JMS implementation
    that supplies pubsub and MQ style messaging.
