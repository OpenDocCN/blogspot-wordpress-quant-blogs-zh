- en: An economics professor at Texas Tech said he had never failed a single student
    before but had, once, failed an entire class.

- en: The class had insisted that socialism worked and that no one would be poor and
    no one would be rich, a great equalizer. The professor then said, "OK, we will
    have an experiment in this class on socialism."

  zh: 班上坚持认为社会主义有效，没有人会贫穷，也没有人会富有，这是一个伟大的平等者。教授接着说：“好的，我们在这堂课上来个社会主义实验。”

- en: All grades would be averaged and everyone would receive the same grade so no
    one would fail and no one would receive an A. After the first test the grades
    were averaged and everyone got a B. The students who studied hard were upset and
    the students who studied little were happy.

  zh: 所有分数将被平均，每个人都将得到相同的分数，这样没人会不及格，也没人会得 A。第一次考试后，所有分数被平均后，每个人都得到了 B。用功学习的学生很不满意，而很少学习的学生很高兴。

    even less and the ones who studied hard decided that since they could not make
    an A, they studied less. The second Test average was a D! No one was happy.

  zh: 但，随着第二次考试的到来，很少学习的学生更加少学习了，而努力学习的学生决定既然他们无法得到 A，也不再那么努力学习了。第二次考试的平均分是 D！没人开心了。

- en: Students remember very little from specific classes. Even though this experiment
    is obviously going to generate horrible incentives, the lesson learned probably
    would be more long lasting and profound than any mastery of problem sets with
    indifference curves and linear programming.

  zh: 学生们从具体的课程中记住的很少。尽管这个实验显然会产生可怕的刺激，但学到的教训可能比对无差别曲线和线性规划的问题集的掌握更深远和持久。
