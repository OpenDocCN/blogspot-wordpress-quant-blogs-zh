- en: Previously, it could be very difficult for a developer stopped at a breakpoint
    to know the asynchronous sequence of calls that brought them to the current location. 
    Now in Visual Studio 2013, the Call Stack window surfaces this information, factoring
    in new diagnostics information provided by the runtime.  Further, when an application
    stops making visible forward progress, it’s often difficult to diagnose and to
    understand what asynchronous operations are currently in flight such that their
    lack of completion might be causing the app to hang.  In Visual Studio 2013, the
    Tasks window (formerly called Parallel Tasks in Visual Studio 2010 and Visual
    Studio 2012) now includes details on these async operations so that you can break
    into your app in the debugger and easily see and navigate to everything that’s
    in flight.
