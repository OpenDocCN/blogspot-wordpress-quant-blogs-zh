    This is a rare signal that has only been generated eight times since Marty Zweig
    first wrote about it in 1986\. The stock market has been up 6 and 12 months later
    after every single signal. In some cases, stocks continue to rise like a runaway
    freight train. In three instances, which include the buy signal generated in late
    March, the market rose but pulled back several months later to re-test the buy
    signal level.

    Breadth, as measured by the ratio of S&P 500 to equal-weighted S&P 500 and net
    new highs, has been abysmal in the latest post-buy signal advance. Leadership
    has been mainly concentrated in the megacap growth stocks and small and mid-caps
    haven’t participated in market strength in the same way.
