    that the numbers have dropped so low I can barely see the line on my Tradestation
    screen. This indicator simply measures 30-day historical volatility and normalizes
    this figure using percentiles (hence the percentrank). Right now, we are in a
    “super” low volatility regime–which can be defined by historical volatility being
    less than the 5th percentile which has a tendency to be temporary and revert in
    the longer term. When measured differently using the term structure of volatility
    (VIX vs VXV) this has intermediate-term bearish implications as highlighted in
    Rob Hanna’s Quantifiable Edges Subscriber Letter [http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/) that
    I read every night. While I do not claim to be an expert in the topic of volatility,
    I do notice a lot of mis-informed new pundits/and financial media stars suggesting
    that this ultra-low volatility is highly negative in the short term. Contrary
    to popular belief, this is actually not true at all. Lets look at some quick stats:'

- en: The implication is that super-low volatility is uniformly bullish. Not much
    difference regardless of whether the  short or long term trend was up. In fact,
    if today was an up day this tended to have the highest edge overall with nearly
    60% of winners the following day and the edge has actually been even higher in
    recent times. A couple notes–over a third of this edge in the super low volatility
    environment was realized in the overnight market which is typical of bull markets
    in general. Given that the next day return was fairly low on average—on balance
    this setup presents little opportunity for day traders short of catching the odd
    major breakout/breakdown. I will qualify however that the current setup is mildly negative
    for the next 5 days given that the DVI>.5 and several other indicators present
    a slight bearish bias.
