    When the executive VP says 'the United Way chairmanship was the most important
    job I had here at Amalgamated,' it is a lie; when they imply that their main satisfaction
    comes from knowing their customers or voters are better off, it is a lie. Sure,
    there's an element of truth to what they are saying, but emphasis is important
    too. So, lying is part of life, especially in regard to hierarchies, because any
    hierarchy needs some platitudes about the greater good to maintain their legitimacy.

    His basic strategy was to find 2 deck black jack tables, which would give him
    enough time to count cards and generate an advantage. If they reshuffled too early,
    say after 52 cards, he couldn't make money, and this was part discretionary, part
    casino rule.

    worth it to me. As a job, not an avocation, it didn't seem fun, or even really
    well paying. The basic card counting part of the job is pretty mechanical and
    after repetition rather easy. Most importantly, he had a very interesting time
    with the dealers. Basically, you want them to know and like you, but just a little.
    Too much, and they will catch on to your game, too little and they won't do you
    any favors.

    on dealer, which in the context of their weekend is not a lot. Thus, they might
    choose to deal to you with only 25 cards left in the shoe, if they like you, whereas
    if they don't like you they will reshuffle after 50 cards. A great salesman is
    one who can make customers like them so much they don't mind paying a little extra,
    and don't like to even think about what is happening (like when dupes don't care
    their partner is using them because they are so adorable). Smarts are necessary
    to make this happen, but to make it a really valuable strategy you need the ability
    to make the opportunity cost seem a lot smaller than it is.
