- en: One possible market positive is that prior to small drop Monday's drop the SPX
    was locked in a persistent rally. I've shown a few different ways in the past
    that persistent rallies are unlikely to end abruptly. Instead they will either
    continue higher after a brief pullback, or action will become choppy prior to
    a sizable move lower. This is shown in the study below.

    out over the next several days.  The 9-10 day time frame shows exceptional stats.
     The 2-day timeframe suggests a quick little boost is also likely.
