    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    in the direction of the main Trend Model signal. A bullish Trend Model signal
    that gets less bullish is a trading "sell" signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend
    Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading "buy" signal. The history of
    actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of the trading model are shown by
    the arrows in the chart below. The turnover rate of the trading model is high,
    and it has varied between 150% to 200% per month.

    the US imposed a series of tariffs on $34b of Chinese goods at 12:01 ET on July
    6, 2018, and the Chinese retaliated with tariffs of their own. For investors,
    the current environment presents a dilemma.

    is bearish for growth, and for equity prices. On the other hand, the near-term
    outlook for economic growth and earnings are bright. In the absence of trade tensions,
    US stock prices should be breaking out to new highs.

    Is a Trade War Apocalypse just around the corner, which will collapse the index
    to new lows; or is this a case of sell the rumor, and buy the news? Arguably,
    the market''s rangebound behavior in 2018 is attributable to the earnings growth
