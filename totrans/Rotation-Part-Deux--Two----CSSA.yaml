    In our examples we used ETF Rewind’s Rotation tool. [http://marketrewind.blogspot.com/2010/02/etf-rewind-announcing-customizable.html](http://marketrewind.blogspot.com/2010/02/etf-rewind-announcing-customizable.html)

    rotation model, and that adding bonds and a cash proxy had a much bigger impact
    on returns and risk-adjusted returns. Its now time to see if we can take things
    to the next level. We want something that is uncorrelated to stocks and bonds
    but is also diversified and typically delivers high returns relative to volatility.
    The natural addition to the rotation model is to choose a commodity index, which
    matches all of these desired characteristics. In keeping with the highly practical
    model of using ETF’s, we will use ticker DBC which is highly liquid and is a good
    proxy for a basket of major commodities. As a reminder, included in the previous
    test were tickers SPY, IWM, QQQQ, SHY, and AGG, for this run we will also include
    DBC. Lets take a look at the results:'

- en: The returns of the model are a stellar 27% CAGR with a sharpe ratio (risk-adjusted
    return) over 1\. This is a substantial improvement on the previous run which showed
    a 13% CAGR and .6 Sharpe ratio. Note that both absolute and risk-adjusted returns
    are higher than in the previous model. The lower correlation of DBC to the others
    allowed us to achieve higher returns in 2007 and early 2008 while the other asset
    classes were struggling. Furthermore, the commodity index is valuable in the model
    because it has no credit risk (unlike individual stocks), and similar long-term
    return/risk as the major stock indexes.

- en: The question is can we make this even better? The way to improve the model is
    to remove some of the multicollinearity and noise by eliminating redundant asset
    classes. In this case, QQQQ, and IWM have a complex relationship with timing the
    SPY and are best utilized within the context of of a different framework. [http://marketsci.wordpress.com/2010/01/27/a-different-spin-on-the-%e2%80%9cperfect-alignment%e2%80%9d-theory/](http://marketsci.wordpress.com/2010/01/27/a-different-spin-on-the-%e2%80%9cperfect-alignment%e2%80%9d-theory/)
    Another model component- EFA- represents the major developed markets and has a
    very high correlation with the SPY, making it somewhat redundant. Another redundant
    asset is AGG, which is the aggregate bond index–this has much less “safety value”
    than SHY (the 1-3 year T-bond index), and has less upside than some of the other
    asset classes in the model.

- en: 'There are also some potential asset classes that are worthwhile adding to improve
    absolute and risk-adjusted returns. The most logical addition to the model will
    give us a low or even negative correlation, and a good potential return/vol with
    low credit risk. Why not have the ability to go short one of the model components?
    Thus the simple answer is to add an inverse ETF to the model that is not leveraged.
    In this case we will add ticker “SH” which is simply the S&P500 Short ETF which
    as the name suggests will simply sell short the S&P500 index. The benefit from
    a practical perspective is that this ETF is highly liquid, can be traded without
    having the hassles involved with short-selling and removes the risk of future
    short-selling restrictions. Another good addition is to have some currency exposure–the
    Euro also has a negative correlation to many of the model components and has low
    volatility relative to its prospective return. It also helps to substitute for
    dropping EFA which is tied heavily to Europe. For this we will use ishares Euro
    which is ticker “FXE.” Finally lets add a Real Estate component, and in keeping
    with adding back some international exposure, why not add some Canadian REITs.
    Note that this also carries a very nice dividend yield that is not factored into
    performance.This ticker to represent this component is “XRE.TO.” Lets add these
    asset classes to the model and see how it affects performance. So our final model
    list of tickers will be: **SPY, **DBC**, EEM, SHY, SH, FXE, XRE.TO**'

- en: Voila! This is not only a major improvement in terms of CAGR, but the Sharpe
    ratio is nearly 1.5 which is much higher than the previous model. Considering
    that turnover does not occur too frequently, this is a fairly realistic backtest-
    though obviously testing over longer periods is recommended. Nonetheless, given
    that the model is logical, there is no reason to believe that this will not perform
    well in the future. Note that I am using this model and a couple others to trade
    longer-term capital.
