# Quantifiable Edges: A Bullish Study That is Re-Triggering

I mentioned yesterday that I am seeing a real mix of studies, and that remains true.  So after showing one for the bears yesterday, let’s look at a bullish one today.  You’ll hopefully recognize it because it last triggered just over a week ago.  I showed it in the July 30th blog and have updated the results below.

The last instance was followed by a 4-day pullback and then a very large rally on day 5 that wiped out all the losses.  Results have consistently led to at least some upside over the short-term.

There remain both positives (like today’s study) and negatives (like yesterday’s) to take into account.  Perhaps a little caution is warranted.
