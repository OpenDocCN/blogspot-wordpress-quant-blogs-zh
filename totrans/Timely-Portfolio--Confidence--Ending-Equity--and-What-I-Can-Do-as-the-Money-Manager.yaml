    a general discussion piece.  More than on any post, I would absolutely love feedback
    and comments good or bad.

    Would you have added or subtracted money? Although I do not know your answer,
    I probably would have subtracted money or closed the account entirely.

    subtract than how well I perform. While I can manage risk and return as your money
    manager, I unfortunately cannot control this most important determinant of your
    ending wealth. Without confidence, money management fails, so what I do to build
    and maintain your confidence probably will build your wealth more than my geometrically
    linked returns. My method for building and maintaining your confidence and ultimately
    your ending wealth requires two elements: open honest communication and drawdown
    minimization.'

    to go both ways. I will continue to send quarterly updates and performance reports,
    but I also need to know your feelings, concerns, suggestions, questions, life
    changes, or really anything so I can help achieve your financial objectives. I
    am available by phone, email, mail, face-to-face, text message, Twitter, Skype,
    and IM.

    lost than the underperformance. Fear crushes confidence, and if I can keep drawdowns
    under 10-15%, then both the duration and magnitude of your fear will be greatly
    relieved.

    The manager in the above chart was Warren Buffett, and if you retained Buffett/Berkshire
    through 2010, you would have made $161 million more on an initial $100,000 investment
    than the S&P 500\. I in no way claim an ability to replicate Warren Buffett’s
    performance or management style, but I think this offers a good illustration of
    how even one of the world’s all-time best money managers could have lost his clients’
    confidence and potentially impacted their ending net worth.

    just believed in me. The ones who had faith stayed on; you couldn't get my Aunt
    Katie to sell if you came at her with a crowbar. But the people who came in later
    because they thought the stock was cheap and they were attracted to my record
    didn't always stay. It's a process of natural selection."
