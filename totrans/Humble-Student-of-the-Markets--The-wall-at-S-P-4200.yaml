- en: The S&P 500 has been trading sideways since mid-April, with overhead resistance
    at roughly the 4200 level. While the market action in the past week has been frustrating
    for both bulls and bears, I believe the index should be able to advance past the
    4200 level to test the old highs and probably make marginal new highs in early
    June. My bullish view is supported by the behavior of the VIX Index, which has
    convincingly fallen below its 20 dma after recycling from above its upper Bollinger
    Band.
