    position in an increasingly global economy. Anyone interested in our economic
    future and especially our technology policies should read this book.

- en: You can admire works that are directly in contrast because they make good cases
    for their contradictory points. You might appreciate Barro and Krugman's take
    on the stimulus package because they are clear expositions of conflicting arguments.
    Yet that interpretation is probably too generous for your average conflicting
    blurb (as when Peter Bernstein, author of hagiographies of the founders of the
    Modern Portfolio Theory, writes a blurb for Taleb's Black Swan, which argues such
    ideas are worse than useless). A lot of public praise seems to reflect Oscar Wilde's
    observation that 'One can always be kind to people about whom one cares nothing'.
