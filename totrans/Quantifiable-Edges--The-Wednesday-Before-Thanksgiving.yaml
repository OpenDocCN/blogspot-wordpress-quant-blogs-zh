    Wednesday before and the Friday after have exhibited bullish tendencies while
    the Monday after has been slightly bearish.

    curve moving higher today, but over the years the next couple of days has been
    a pretty good bullish bet.  And when seasonality is this consistent it is often
    worth keeping in mind.
