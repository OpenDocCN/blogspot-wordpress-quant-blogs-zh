## Securing Code Through Social Engineering

Christina Camilleri has an interesting [presentation](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/security-social-engineering) from QCon on “Securing Code Through Social Engineering”.  Christina provides a few real world stories around social engineering (7mins) – password reset over the phone.  Secure code has improved over the years due to publicity of issues from large companies like Microsoft and Adobe, and also thanks to the [checklists](https://www.owasp.org), libraries, frameworks and books written about secure software engineering.  However, social engineering can bypass all of these code improvements.

Be careful when your banks rings you 🙂
