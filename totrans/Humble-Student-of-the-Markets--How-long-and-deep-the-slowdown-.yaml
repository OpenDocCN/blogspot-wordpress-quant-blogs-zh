    Soviet era assets which would create a drag on the German economy. The world began

    assets. Like Germany, much of US exports is intellectual property. It has an open
    economy, people from all over the world flock to its universities and its intellectual
    property exports have enabled it to re-invent itself periodically. I lived in
    Boston for nearly a decade and has seen it first hand. Research on radar was done
    in Boston during the Second World War. Over the successive decades, companies
    based in the area have demonstrated that Boston is a center of innovation. Examples
    include Digital Equipment, Lotus Development, the dot-coms during the tech bubble.
    The biotechs that dot the landscape today are a testament to the brainpower that
    is the source of intellectual property exports and America’s competitive advantage.
