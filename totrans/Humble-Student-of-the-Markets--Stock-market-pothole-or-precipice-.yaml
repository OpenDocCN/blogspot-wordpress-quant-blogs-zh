    it into some pseudo-state or new part of the Russian Federation. Ukraine loses
    a sunny peninsula, but also a distinct drain on the state’s coffers (the Crimean
    economy is not great, and the region receives net subsidies from the centre).
    It sheds the most troublesome and Russophile of its regions, one which has been
    a turbulent locus of trouble for Kyiv for most of post-Soviet Ukraine’s history.
    It also gets concrete proof of the threat it faces from Russian bullying and probably
    accelerated and solicitous assistance from the US, EU, NATO, etc. It also validates
