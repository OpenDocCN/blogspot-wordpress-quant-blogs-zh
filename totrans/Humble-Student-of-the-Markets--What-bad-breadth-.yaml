    of the stock market as an army. To discern the direction of the market, you should
    watch the way the bulk of the army is moving. Maturing bull markets, it is said,
    typically have narrowing leadership of large cap stocks. When the major averages
    like the Dow may continue to advance and achieve new highs but the rest of the
    market fail to show similar levels of strength, it becomes a case of the generals
    leading but the troops refuse to follow - a warning sign for stock prices.

    about what this indicator or that indicator is doing, I thought I would conduct
    a survey of different popular breadth measures, along with their behavior in the
    last major market decline in 2007-2008.

    The chart below of the SP 1500 advance-decline line is showing a case of continue
    strength. The bull is still charging, according to this measure.

    the "troops" is to watch the performance of small caps compared to large caps.
    The chart below shows three lines. The black line in the top panel shows the relative
    ratio of the small cap Russell 2000 Index (IWM) against the large cap SP 500 (SPY).
    The orange line is the relative return of the equal weighted SP 500 (RSP) against
    the cap weighted SP 500 (SPY). This relative ratio measures the relative of small
    caps "troops" against the large cap "generals" in a slightly different way than
    a simple Russell 2000 to SP 500 ratio. The equal weight SP 500 gives an equal
    weight to the heavyweights in the index such as Apple, GE and ExxonMobil, shows
    the movements of the individual stocks in the index in a more "democratic" (1
    stock, 1 vote) fashion. The the third line in the chart in bottom panel shows
    the SP 500.

    ratio appears to be more stable and less volatile compared to the IWM/SPY ratio,
    though they are well correlated with each other. In 2007-2008 bear market episode,
    both of the RSP/SPY and IWM/SPY breadth indicators topped out a few months before
    the final top in 2007 and deteriorated significantly afterwards. During the budget
    impasse and eurozone crisis scare of 2011, breadth deterioration was roughly coincidental
    with the market. Today, these breadth indicators are either flat or trending upwards
    and show few indications of a major top developing.

    behaving. The chart below of SP 500 Highs - Lows show only minor weakness, compared
    to a pattern of major deterioration during the 2007-2008 episode. This indicator
    seems to be very noisy. I would hesitate about using this indicator to call a
    top without a prolonged pattern lower lows and lower highs.

    of stocks in the SP 500 that are showing point and figure buy signals. Here the
    signals are a bit more mixed. At one level, we are seeing some breadth deterioration
    as there is a pattern of lower lows and lower highs. However, this kind of downtrend
    has thrown off false warnings in the past. On the other hand, this index has not
    fallen to levels (shaded in yellow) where major declines have occurred in the
    past.

- en: My last breadth indicator, the percentage of stocks in the SP 500 trading their
    200 day moving average, is telling a story of caution. As the chart below shows,
    this indicator has been deteriorating in a pattern of lower lows and lower highs
    for about a year. During the 2007-2008 episode, this indicator topped out several
    months ahead of the actual top. One logical way of using this indicator is use
    the deterioration as a warning sign, but don't sell until the actual trend break
    in the SP 500 itself, which is marked by the vertical red line. Today, we had
    a minor trend break in the SP 500 when the market dipped below its 50 day moving
    average in its most recent decline. However, it was only a brief and minor violation
    of the uptrend. While it does serve as a warning sign, I cannot call the event
    a definitive sell signal for the market in light of the strength of the other
    breadth indicators.

- en: In summary, the weight of the evidence my survey of breadth indicators and their
    behavior in the past eight years indicate that the market isn't showing a case
    of bad breadth yet. Breadth indicators, while mixed overall, are tilted slightly
    bullishly. While some stock market weakness may be around the corner, it is probably
    too early to call a top in the stock market. These reading suggest that further
    new highs in the major indices are possible and the next 5% move is more like
    to be up than down.

    are accompanied by warning signs of technical deterioration. Getting bearish today
    seems to be overly premature. The current technical picture is still consistent
    with my base case scenario of a stock market top later this year (see
