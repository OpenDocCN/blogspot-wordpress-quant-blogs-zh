- en: This is the Nov12 / Jan13 NYMEX natural gas spread during today's EIA inventory
    report.  The annualized spread differential for this pair is about 19.5 cents
    per month.  According to some physical traders I spoke with, the cost of carry
    for this type of trade is about 10 cents per month.  Despite the massive premium
    available for those who are able to take delivery, inject into storage, withdraw
    from storage, then sell it against the Jan13 contract, this spread maintains its
    elevated state precisely because storage capacity for the winter months is so
    constrained.
