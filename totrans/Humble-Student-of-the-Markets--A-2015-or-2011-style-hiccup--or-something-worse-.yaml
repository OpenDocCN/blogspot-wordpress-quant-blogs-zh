    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    in the direction of the main Trend Model signal. A bullish Trend Model signal
    that gets less bullish is a trading "sell" signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend
    Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading "buy" signal. The history of
    actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of the trading model are shown by
    the arrows in the chart below. The turnover rate of the trading model is high,
    and it has varied between 150% to 200% per month.

- en: Callum Thomas has a terrific chart depicting the scope of the global stock market
    weakness. At the end of October, roughly 13% of global indices were above their
    200 day moving averages (dma). Such readings are normally seen at intermediate
    term lows, or as part of a broad based bear market.

    buy with both hands. On the other hand, if this is the start of a recession-induced
    bear market, investors should continue to de-risk their portfolios.

    But there are several smaller things: trouble in emerging markets, some softening
    of housing, commercial real estate, corporate debt. So we could have a “smorgasbord”
    recession like 1990-91, with several factors coming together. This could be a
    problem, because interest rates are still low and there’s not much room to cut.'
