- en: Last week, sector sentiment gleaned from the Twitter stream had every sector
    positive. When this occurs a short term market top materializes usually within
    the following week. Once in a while, the sectors will paint another week with
    all of them in positive territory, then the top comes. Basically, when every sector
    is being bought aggressively it signals that the market is overbought.
