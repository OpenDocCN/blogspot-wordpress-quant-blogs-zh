    debacle. They seemed to have identified key errors in judgment, and were refreshingly
    detailed in the origin of their write-down (I never saw anything similar among
    US banks). Everyone slips up now and then, and so I figured that was a sign of
    a healthy organization that merely made a singular mistake.

    gritty issues like what's on the balance sheet. A smart banker avoids positions
    unrelated to the core business of originating and distributing loans and deposits
    and other financial instruments. For example, it does not make sense to trade
    corn futures if you have no business with futures exchanges or corn growers.
