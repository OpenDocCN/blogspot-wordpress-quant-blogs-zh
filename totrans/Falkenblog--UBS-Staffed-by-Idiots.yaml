    debacle. They seemed to have identified key errors in judgment, and were refreshingly
    detailed in the origin of their write-down (I never saw anything similar among
    US banks). Everyone slips up now and then, and so I figured that was a sign of
    a healthy organization that merely made a singular mistake.
