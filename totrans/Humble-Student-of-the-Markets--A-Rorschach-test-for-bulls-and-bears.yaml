  zh: 本周早些时候，stockcharts.com的John Murphy撰写了关于铜/金价比率作为衡量市场先生如何看待宏观经济情绪和势头的一个指标：
- en: Gold is bought in times of financial stress when stocks are in trouble. Copper
    is bought when economic conditions are better and stock prices are rising. The
    gold/copper ratio tells whether investors are optimistic or pessimistic. The fact
    that the ratio has been falling over the last two years suggests more optimism
    on the economy and stock market. A stronger global economy supports the price
    of copper, and diminishes the appeal of gold.

- en: This chart presents a Rorschach inkblot test for both bulls and bears alike.
    Do you focus on the enormous gap between the SPY/AGG ratio against the copper/gold
    ratio and interpret it as stocks have run too far too fast? Or do you focus on
    the uptrend in the copper/gold ratio as a sign of positive momentum in global
    macro economic conditions, with the belief that it is the direction of the copper/gold
    ratio that matters and not the magnitude of the move?

  zh: 这张图表为多头和空头都提供了一个罗夏墨迹测试。你是关注SPY/AGG比率与铜/金比率之间的巨大差距，并将其解读为股票跑得过于快速过于远？还是关注铜/金比率的上升趋势，将其视为全球经济状况积极势头的一个标志，相信重要的是铜/金比率的方向而不是移动的幅度？
- en: I can argue both sides. My inner investor tells me to focus on the gap, as stocks
    appear to be overextended against bonds. My inner trader, on the other hand, tells
    me to stay with the momentum until we see signs that the copper/gold ratio starts
    to roll over.

- en: The challenge at present is that last week’s Fed’s decision does make an already
    precarious situation more precarious. So the question is how to respond. From
    the experience of the past few years, the risk is that enthusiasm that the Fed
    is “all-in” could prompt a surge of further speculation, and even greater financial
    distortions. At the same time, examining market cycles over a century of market
    history, ***present conditions cluster among the most negative 2-3% of data points
    in terms of average return and downside risk.***

  zh: 当前的挑战是，上周美联储的决定使得已经岌岌可危的情况变得更加危险。所以问题是如何应对。从过去几年的经验来看，风险在于，美联储“全力以赴”的乐观情绪可能会引发进一步的投机激增，甚至造成更大的金融扭曲。同时，在超过一个世纪的市场历史中，检视市场周期，目前的状况在平均回报和下行风险方面聚集在数据点中最负面的2-3%之中。

  zh: 然而，他提出了他所说的“一种投机的突然加速”的可能性：
- en: My impression is this. Based on numerous past speculative episodes in the financial
    markets, we know that financial bubbles have often proceeded in an oscillating
    pattern featuring increasingly frequent cycles of advance, punctuated by gradually
    shallower declines reflecting an accelerating eagerness to buy dips. This can
    produce what Didier Sornette has called “log-periodic” oscillations (see [Increasingly
    Immediate Impulses to Buy the Dip](http://www.hussmanfunds.com/wmc/wmc130415.htm)).
    Given the negative return/risk estimates we observed in April and early-May, I
    believed that this series of oscillations was ending several months ago. In order
    to preserve a log-periodic pattern, further oscillations needed to exhibit an
    even faster alternation between steeply-sloped advances and shallow declines.
    Yet despite the strongly negative return/risk estimates we already had in April
    and May, this is unfortunately what has unfolded. With the Fed’s decision last
    week, we can’t rule out one particularly extreme version of a log-periodic bubble
    that is consistent with price fluctuations to date. That version is pictured below,
    and would comprise an advance above 1800 in the SP 500 over a period of about
    6 weeks. *Again, this is emphatically not a forecast*, but the conditions for
    a final wave of speculation may have been created by the Fed’s decision last week,
    and it leaves us unable to rule out this admittedly hypothetical possibility –
    particularly in the context of what has been a classic Sornette-type bubble to-date.

  zh: 我的看法是这样的。基于过去金融市场上无数的投机事件，我们知道金融泡沫往往呈现出一种震荡的模式，这种模式特点是上涨周期越来越频繁，被逐渐变浅的下跌所分隔，反映出人们买入低点的迫切心情日益增强。这可能导致Didier
    Sornette所说的“对数周期性”震荡（参见[买入低点的冲动越来越即时](http://www.hussmanfunds.com/wmc/wmc130415.htm)）。鉴于我们在四月和五月初观察到的负面回报/风险估计，我认为这一系列震荡几个月前就已经结束了。为了保持对数周期性模式，进一步的震荡需要表现出在陡峭上涨和浅幅下跌之间的更快交替。然而，尽管我们在四月和五月的回报/风险估计已经非常负面，不幸的是，这正是已经发生的情况。考虑到美联储上周的决定，我们不能排除一个与至今价格波动一致的、特别极端的对数周期性泡沫版本。下面展示的版本将在大约6周内使标普500指数上涨超过1800点。*请注意，这绝对不是一种预测*，但美联储上周的决定可能已经创造了最后一段投机浪潮的条件，这使得我们无法排除这种显然是假设的可能性——特别是在迄今为止一直是一种经典的Sornette型泡沫的背景下。

- en: Strategic Growth Fund remains fully hedged, with a “staggered strike” position
    that places the strike prices of its index put options close to present market
    levels. Last week’s decision by the Federal Reserve to defer any reduction in
    the pace of quantitative easing adds near-term uncertainty. My concern is that
    investors may draw on this decision as evidence that the Federal Open Market Committee
    (FOMC) has placed some sort of “safety net” below the market, and that the surprising
    extension of its current policies could spark a short-term speculative “blowoff.”
    ***Given the relatively depressed level of implied volatility (which affects the
    cost of index option premiums), combined with some potential for the Fed decision
    to provoke a steep, if short-lived speculative response, we added a very small
    position in out-of-the-money index call options in Strategic Growth Fund late
    last week***. This position serves mainly as a low cost “contingent” stance that
    may reduce the impact of our hedging in the event that the major indices advance
    by more than a few percent in the coming weeks.

  zh: 战略增长基金继续保持完全对冲，采取“错位执行价格”的策略，将其指数看跌期权的执行价格定在接近当前市场水平。美联储上周决定推迟减少量化宽松政策的步伐，这增加了近期的市场不确定性。我担心投资者可能会将此决定作为证据，认为联邦公开市场委员会（FOMC）在市场下方设置了一些“安全网”，并且其当前政策的意外延长可能会引发短期的投机“高潮”。***鉴于隐含波动率（影响指数期权费用的水平）相对较低，结合美联储决定可能引发的、即使短暂的剧烈投机反应的潜在可能性，我们上周在战略增长基金中增加了一个非常小的、执行价格高于市场的指数看涨期权头寸***。这个头寸主要作为一种低成本的“应急”立场，如果主要指数在接下来的几周内上涨超过几个百分点，这可能会减少我们对冲的影响。
