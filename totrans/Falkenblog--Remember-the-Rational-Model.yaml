    not trading generates no utility, so you want to get the highest possible value.
    All goods, including yours, are of uncertain value, and you have a noisy, unbiased
    estimate of all the values, as do others. Some have less noise around their estimations
    than others, though you do not know who. So, when someone shows up, and really
    really wants to trade their good for yours good, are you excited? No. They probably
    they have value well beneath yours. What is most interesting is if the person
    is marginally interested in trading with you, because that means they might be
    right in the sweet spot: not so low you could do obviously better, but high enough
    to be practically optimal given search costs.'

- en: ', surprising no one. People are attracted more to those who are kind of interested,
    as opposed to really interested. This is consistent with the simple, rational
    bayesian model that is perfunctory for economists. It is almost more common than
    not that a popular book on economics caricatures this model as insanely unrealistic.
    We should remember that this model actually explains a lot, and when it fails
    often points out we are missing something in people''s information sets, as opposed
    to something in their neurology. When a company announces positive news, the stock
    generally rises, when Treasuries fall, its usually because people are forecasting
    lower inflation or lower future real rates. These are uninteresting ''dog bites
    man'' stories because they are so common and make sense using the standard rational
    model.'
