> 来源：[https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2010/08/03/dvixl/#0001-01-01](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2010/08/03/dvixl/#0001-01-01)

**DVixl**– an excel platform with real-time, charting, propietary indicators and tools, limited back-testing,  and alerts.  DVixl makes trading easier *for technophobes  that are not proficient in coding (like me!) and want to make life simpler for identifying trading opportunities*. Unlike most other platforms like Amibroker and Tradestation, DVixl is  no-frills, no-hassle and no-nonsense. If you just want to use basic trading indicators, a small suite of proprietary DV Indicators, and also have  an ***expert advisor tool that is highly robust and helps identify intermediate term trading opportunities so you don’t have to watch the screen every day–this is for you!***
