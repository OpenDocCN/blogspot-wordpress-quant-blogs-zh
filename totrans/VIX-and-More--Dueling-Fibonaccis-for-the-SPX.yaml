- en: I had suspected that I might get some pushback from some of the charting purists
    about limiting the scope of my [Fibonacci](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Fibonacci)
    retracement lines to a post-Lehman world, particularly since the SPX had already
    corrected more than 300 points prior to the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy filing.

- en: My explanation, quite simply, is that the investment world changed radically
    in September 2008, both from a fundamental and technical perspective. I even used
    the term [Market 2.0](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/09/market-20.html) to
    describe the situation at that time. Technically, at that time the markets transitioned
    from a measured decline to a series of free falls that took ten day historical
    volatility to as high as 100 in October.

- en: 'In the chart below, I have superimposed two different sets of Fibonacci retracements
    on top of almost two years of daily SPX data. The dotted blue lines repeat my
    post-Lehman world view as presented in [SPX and Fibonacci Resistance at 966](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/06/spx-and-fibonacci-resistance-at-966.html)
    earlier today; the solid green lines reflect a more traditional approach to Fibonacci
    calculations, using the October 2007 high of 1576 as a point of departure. I have
    highlighted the 50% retracement levels for both sets of calculations, using blue
    arrows for the post-Lehman data and green arrows for the data going back to 2007\.
    Note that the difference is a full 155 points: 966 in a post-Lehman world and
    1121 using the 2007 high.'

    to the green Fibonacci lines. In the meantime, I continue to believe that the
    post-Lehman period – at least while the SPX remains below 1000 – is the appropriate
    time frame on which to focus our analytical lens.
