# VIX and More: SPX at Post-Lehman Fib Retracement Target of 1035-1037

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/08/spx-at-post-lehman-fib-retracement.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/08/spx-at-post-lehman-fib-retracement.html#0001-01-01)

There have been several posts (see below) in this space that have addressed the issue of Fibonacci retracements in the S&P 500 index. In the dialogue, I have been a proponent of using a post-Lehman high in conjunction with the March low to arrive at a set of post-Lehman Fibonacci retracement numbers. Depending upon whether one uses just the real bodies of the candlestick (open and close) or includes the shadows (adds intraday highs and lows), the 61.8% retracement of the post-Lehman high falls in the range of 1035 to 1037.

A short while ago, the SPX established a new high for the year of 1035.82, which puts it right at the post-Lehman Fibonacci retracement target price, as shown in the chart below, which uses relatively unusual two-day candles.

I have been waiting patiently for two or more consecutive days of weakness and/or a 5% pullback from the highs to open up some aggressive short positions. With the Fibonacci retracement target hit, I am now more likely to start to scale into some short positions early, assuming we start to see some sort of meaningful weakness in stocks this millennium…
