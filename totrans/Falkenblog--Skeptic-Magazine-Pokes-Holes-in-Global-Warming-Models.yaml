    correctness, a nice contrast to the politically influenced Russian scientists
    during the Cold War. And of course its not just political correctness: the US
    gives about $2B a year to study global warming, which means a lot of objective
    scientists are paid to basically come up with studies that support the hypothesis.
    That''s a lot of money, and it''s naive to think this doesn''t influence the findings.'

  zh: 在俄罗斯，他们并不真的在乎全球变暖，俄罗斯科学家也不愚蠢。他认为这是因为他们不受西方政治正确性的影响，这与冷战期间受政治影响的俄罗斯科学家形成了鲜明对比。当然这不仅仅是政治正确性：美国每年拨款约20亿美元用于研究全球变暖，这意味着很多客观的科学家基本上是受雇于提出支持这一假设的研究。这是很多钱，天真地认为这不会影响研究结果。

- en: Part of it is the simple story. CO2 is a greenhouse gas. Cars and such create
    CO2\. Ergo, more CO2, more warming. It's like Y2K, which was so plausible because
    the story was simple enough to explain to 60 year old executive (who had never
    coded in his life). But CO2 is only 0.036% of the atmosphere, and that is only
    15% of the greenhouse gasses (water vapor and methane being the most). As humans
    only produce 2% of the CO2 annually (most is from water evaporation), I think
    its reasonable to assume that the natural variability of CO2 makes it difficult
    to assert that human activity is directly causing the temperature increase. After
    all, historically, you can't really infer from ice core samples whether the CO2
    temperature relation is driven by the temperature causing CO2 to rise (say, via
    a Milkankovitch cycle), or vice versa. Further, there is the natural variability
    in the other greenhouses gases. For example, a one percent change in water vapor
    does the same thing as doubling the carbon dioxide in the air, and water vapor
    can vary by a factor of 2 day to day, so I'm sure it varies at the scales that
    matter for these doomsday scenarios. Then there's the CO2 mechanism. CO2 absorbs
    all radiation available to it in 10 meters. More CO2 only shortens the distance.
    Either way, anything that can be absorbed by CO2 is already being absorbed.

- en: There are lots of positive and negative feedback loops in an ecosystem like
    the Earth. Given the persistence of life over hundreds of millions of years, one
    should think there are many more negative feedback loops (dampening effects),
    because if we were always on this unstable inflection point, we should see massive
    extinctions every million years. But the global warming alarmists just assume
    that the system is mainly full of positive feedback effects (wikipedia

- en: on Global Warming, and they note that the current Global Warming Models greatly
    understate their uncertainty, because the standard errors refer merely to the
    model's errors--assuming they are true. That is, no uncertainty due to parameter
    uncertainty, or functional form uncertainty. The author estimates that the uncertainty
    in the part of the model that addresses cloud cover generates a 100 degree uncertainty
    band over 100 years. That's right, 100 degrees. With this much uncertainty inherent
    in these models, for this one aspect, one could reasonably assume these models
    are pretty worthless for long-run forecasting.

    20°C. Localized effects vary wildly between the equator and poles. Then there
    are random variations in such things as the Gulf Stream in the Atlantic Ocean
    which heats Europe, and El Nino which affects the US. But supposedly, out of that
    maelstrom, climate scientists can deduce the human-created CO2 is sufficient to
    take us to a tipping point. It's like saying, if you eat that French Fry, you're

- en: Models are maps of reality, not reality. Often they capture a select subset
    of what is going on, and so have little overall relevance. For example, the major
    7 money center banks in the US had annualized 99% VaRs of about $1.8B in 2007,
    but still managed to lose an average of $42B in market value over the past 12
    months. Now, either their models were really wrong, or, more likely, they weren't
    that bad, they just excluded a lot of really important stuff (you should read
    the fine print by the asterisks). Such models are often useful in piecemeal application,
    but until one can demonstrate realistic, out-of-sample correlations on meaningful
    applications, they should be applied and discussed piecemeal.

  zh: 模型是对现实的图景，而不是现实本身。通常它们捕捉了正在发生的一部分事情，因此整体上相关性不大。例如，美国主要的七家中心银行在2007年的年化99% 的VaR约为18亿美元，但在过去12个月内平均损失了420亿美元的市值。现在，要么他们的模型真的错了，要么更有可能他们并不是那么糟糕，只是排除了很多真正重要的事情（你应该仔细阅读星号的小字）。这样的模型在零散应用中通常很有用，但在能够展示有意义应用的现实、样本相关性之前，它们应该被零散地应用和讨论。
