    are not stupid. He thinks this is because they aren''t influenced by Western political
    correctness, a nice contrast to the politically influenced Russian scientists
    during the Cold War. And of course its not just political correctness: the US
    gives about $2B a year to study global warming, which means a lot of objective
    scientists are paid to basically come up with studies that support the hypothesis.
    That''s a lot of money, and it''s naive to think this doesn''t influence the findings.'

    nonobvious fact indicates the 'facts' are not dominating the public debate, because
    isn't OJ's guilt more obvious than Global Warming? That is, the models that generate
    the scary anthropogenically caused global warming scenario are so complicated,
    how could so many Americans be so certain?

    CO2\. Ergo, more CO2, more warming. It's like Y2K, which was so plausible because
    the story was simple enough to explain to 60 year old executive (who had never
    coded in his life). But CO2 is only 0.036% of the atmosphere, and that is only
    15% of the greenhouse gasses (water vapor and methane being the most). As humans
    only produce 2% of the CO2 annually (most is from water evaporation), I think
    its reasonable to assume that the natural variability of CO2 makes it difficult
    to assert that human activity is directly causing the temperature increase. After
    all, historically, you can't really infer from ice core samples whether the CO2
    temperature relation is driven by the temperature causing CO2 to rise (say, via
    a Milkankovitch cycle), or vice versa. Further, there is the natural variability
    in the other greenhouses gases. For example, a one percent change in water vapor
    does the same thing as doubling the carbon dioxide in the air, and water vapor
    can vary by a factor of 2 day to day, so I'm sure it varies at the scales that
    matter for these doomsday scenarios. Then there's the CO2 mechanism. CO2 absorbs
    all radiation available to it in 10 meters. More CO2 only shortens the distance.
    Either way, anything that can be absorbed by CO2 is already being absorbed.

    the Earth. Given the persistence of life over hundreds of millions of years, one
    should think there are many more negative feedback loops (dampening effects),
    because if we were always on this unstable inflection point, we should see massive
    extinctions every million years. But the global warming alarmists just assume
    that the system is mainly full of positive feedback effects (wikipedia

    understate their uncertainty, because the standard errors refer merely to the
    model's errors--assuming they are true. That is, no uncertainty due to parameter
    uncertainty, or functional form uncertainty. The author estimates that the uncertainty
    in the part of the model that addresses cloud cover generates a 100 degree uncertainty
    band over 100 years. That's right, 100 degrees. With this much uncertainty inherent
    in these models, for this one aspect, one could reasonably assume these models
    are pretty worthless for long-run forecasting.

    consider that global temperatures have increased by 0.6°C this century. How much
    is due to human-based CO2?

    20°C. Localized effects vary wildly between the equator and poles. Then there
    are random variations in such things as the Gulf Stream in the Atlantic Ocean
    which heats Europe, and El Nino which affects the US. But supposedly, out of that
    maelstrom, climate scientists can deduce the human-created CO2 is sufficient to
    take us to a tipping point. It's like saying, if you eat that French Fry, you're
    going to die. Uh huh.

- en: Models are maps of reality, not reality. Often they capture a select subset
    of what is going on, and so have little overall relevance. For example, the major
    7 money center banks in the US had annualized 99% VaRs of about $1.8B in 2007,
    but still managed to lose an average of $42B in market value over the past 12
    months. Now, either their models were really wrong, or, more likely, they weren't
    that bad, they just excluded a lot of really important stuff (you should read
    the fine print by the asterisks). Such models are often useful in piecemeal application,
    but until one can demonstrate realistic, out-of-sample correlations on meaningful
    applications, they should be applied and discussed piecemeal.
