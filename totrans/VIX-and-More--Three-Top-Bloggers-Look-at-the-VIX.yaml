    dirty variety, I was delighted to see that three bloggers who I have a great deal
    of respect for just happen to be featuring articles on the VIX this morning.

    analysis can be applied to the VIX, but the universe of valid approach is much
    smaller for the VIX than it is for other indices. Part of the problem, as I have
    stated here on several occasions, due in part arises from the fact that in the
    case of the VIX, one cannot trade the underlying directly.

    generally use the VIX.'

    to think that while a VIX spike of 40 or more would placate many of those who
    are waiting for a more obvious sign of capitulation, this is not necessary to
    confirm a bottom, particularly given the current trading range of the VIX in the
    low to mid-20s.
