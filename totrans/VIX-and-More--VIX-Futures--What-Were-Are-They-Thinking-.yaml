    hit a new all-time high, indicating that investors believe very strongly that
    the current volatility environment is grossly underestimating what volatility
    will look like in the coming months, particularly in 2011\. This, of course, is
    nothing new, as the links at the bottom of this post will attest to. It is important
    to note, however, that the disconnect between current volatility and the volatility
    levels indicated by the [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures)
    suggest that investors have never had such a [Panglossian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candide)
    outlook as they do now.

    these contracts are far from an ideal prediction mechanism. One only has to look
    back a couple of months to see how the VIX futures saw the balance of 2010 unfolding.
    As the chart below shows, investors were anticipating volatility on the order
    of a VIX of 33-36 for the second half of the year as recently as late May. The
    reality has turned out to be substantially different. Yesterday’s closing prices
    in the VIX futures reflect a downward revision to September VIX futures of 12.60
    points.

    volatility has had so little impact on estimates of volatility for 2011\. Back
    in May, the VIX futures were only quoted through December 2010, but if one mentally
    extends the red trend line formed by the September 2010 through December 2010
    futures, the result is an almost identical to the current expectations of a VIX
    of 31 or so for February through April 2011\. It is almost as if the 12.60 point
    miss is considered irrelevant.

    I would expect those who are holding doom and gloom volatility positions will
    start to capitulate and put some downward pressure on volatility. I do not expect
    the record [contango](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/contango) in
    the VIX futures [term structure](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/term%20structure)
    to hold up much longer. In order for the term structure to begin to flatten out
    and assume a more normal shape, either the back month volatility is going to collapse
    or the near month volatility will have to rise substantially to give credence
    to the expectations of doom and gloom. My thinking continues to favor the former
    scenario.
