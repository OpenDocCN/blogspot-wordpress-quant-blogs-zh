- en: Yesterday, my proprietary the [VIX Futures Contango Index](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20Futures%20Contango%20Index)
    hit a new all-time high, indicating that investors believe very strongly that
    the current volatility environment is grossly underestimating what volatility
    will look like in the coming months, particularly in 2011\. This, of course, is
    nothing new, as the links at the bottom of this post will attest to. It is important
    to note, however, that the disconnect between current volatility and the volatility
    levels indicated by the [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures)
    suggest that investors have never had such a [Panglossian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candide)
    outlook as they do now.

  zh: 昨日，我的专有[VIX期货正向指数](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20Futures%20Contango%20Index)达到新的历史高点，表明投资者坚信当前的波动环境严重低估了未来几个月，特别是2011年的波动情况。当然，这并非什么新鲜事，本文末尾的链接可以证明。然而，当前波动与[VIX期货](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures)预示的波动水平的脱节表明，投资者从未像现在这样有过[潘洛斯](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candide)式的乐观态度。
- en: While the VIX futures may be the market’s best estimate of future volatility,
    these contracts are far from an ideal prediction mechanism. One only has to look
    back a couple of months to see how the VIX futures saw the balance of 2010 unfolding.
    As the chart below shows, investors were anticipating volatility on the order
    of a VIX of 33-36 for the second half of the year as recently as late May. The
    reality has turned out to be substantially different. Yesterday’s closing prices
    in the VIX futures reflect a downward revision to September VIX futures of 12.60
    points.

  zh: 虽然VIX期货可能是市场对未来波动性的最佳估计，但这些合约远离理想的预测机制。只需回顾几个月前，就可以看到VIX期货如何看待2010年的形势发展。如下图所示，投资者直到5月底都预期下半年波动性将达到VIX
    33-36的水平。现实结果与预期相去甚远。昨日VIX期货的收盘价反映了9月份VIX期货向下修正了12.60点。
- en: I find it particularly interesting that the massive overestimation of September
    volatility has had so little impact on estimates of volatility for 2011\. Back
    in May, the VIX futures were only quoted through December 2010, but if one mentally
    extends the red trend line formed by the September 2010 through December 2010
    futures, the result is an almost identical to the current expectations of a VIX
    of 31 or so for February through April 2011\. It is almost as if the 12.60 point
    miss is considered irrelevant.

  zh: 我特别感兴趣的是，对9月份波动性的巨大高估对2011年波动性的估计影响如此之小。去年5月，VIX期货只报价到2010年12月，但如果心理上将由2010年9月至12月期货形成的红色趋势线延长，结果与当前对2011年2月至4月VIX约为31的预期几乎相同。仿佛12.60点的偏差被认为是无关紧要的。
- en: If some large storm clouds do not begin to appear on the horizon in a hurry,
    I would expect those who are holding doom and gloom volatility positions will
    start to capitulate and put some downward pressure on volatility. I do not expect
    the record [contango](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/contango) in
    the VIX futures [term structure](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/term%20structure)
    to hold up much longer. In order for the term structure to begin to flatten out
    and assume a more normal shape, either the back month volatility is going to collapse
    or the near month volatility will have to rise substantially to give credence
    to the expectations of doom and gloom. My thinking continues to favor the former
    scenario.

  zh: 如果天空中不久没有出现巨大的风暴云，我预计那些持有看跌波动头寸的人将开始投降，对波动施加一些向下压力。我不认为VIX期货[期限结构](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/term%20structure)中的记录[正向市场](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/contango)还能维持多久。为了使期限结构开始平坦化并呈现更正常的形状，要么远期波动将崩溃，要么近期波动将需要大幅上升，以支持看跌的预期。我继续看好前一种情况。
