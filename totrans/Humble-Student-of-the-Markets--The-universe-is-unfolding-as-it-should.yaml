    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    in the direction of the main Trend Model signal. A bullish Trend Model signal
    that gets less bullish is a trading "sell" signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend
    Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading "buy" signal. The history of
    actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of the trading model are shown by
    the arrows in the chart below. The turnover rate of the trading model is high,
    and it has varied between 150% to 200% per month.

    year. At the current pace of rate hikes, my long leading indicators will flash
    a recessionary warning late this year, indicating a slowdown in late 2019\. Since
    stock prices tend to look ahead about a year in advance, that puts the the timing
    of an equity market top in Q4 2018\. However, the timing of a recession, and a
    market top, could get pulled forward should a full trade war erupt.

    These conditions suggest that stock prices will make a "last hurrah" rally. Here
    are my trading bull/bear tripwires. The SPX has formed a bullish cup and handle
    breakout with an upside target in the 2925-2960 range. Stay bullish if the index
    holds above its breakout level of 2795-2800\.
