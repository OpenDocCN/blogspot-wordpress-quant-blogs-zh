    markets. Since this blog emphasizes volatility, I wanted to share one that takes
    a long-term view of volatility: the [SPX:VIX ratio](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SPX%3AVIX).'

- en: In the chart below, I have created a graphic which tracks the ratio back to
    the first VIX data from 1990\. In addition to the ratio (black line) and SPX (gray
    area chart), I have also included a blue line that represents a 10% long-term
    trend line for the SPX (for additional information, try [The SPX:VIX Relationship](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/02/spxvix-relationship.html)).
    The key takeaway is that the SPX:VIX ratio is now farther below the trend line
    than it ever has been during the 19 years of VIX data.

    some 21 months ago. As long as the 2000-2002 bear marked seemed, the SPX:VIX ratio
    trended down only three months more (24 months) during that bear stretch.

    around the long-term trend line, but as the graphic shows, the path back to the
    mean can be a long and difficult one.
