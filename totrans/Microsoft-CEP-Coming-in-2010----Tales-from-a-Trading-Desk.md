## Microsoft CEP Coming in 2010?

Looks like Microsoft is going to release a CEP in 2010\. This press [release](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2009/May09/05-11TechEd09PR.mspx) gives a little bit of information – build on top of SQL Server 2008\. Maybe this is another Microsoft Research [powered](http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=70517) applications?

[DAT309 Low-Latency Data and Event Processing with Microsoft SQL Server](http://www.msteched.com/sessionlist/default.aspx)
Presenter: Torsten Grabs
Tue 5/12 | 4:30 PM-5:45 PM | Room 151

While typical relational database applications are query-driven, event-driven applications have become increasingly important. Event-driven applications are characterized by high event data rates, standing queries, and millisecond latency requirements that make it impractical to persist the data in a database before it is processed. These requirements are shared by various scenarios across verticals such as manufacturing, oil and gas, power utilities, financial services as well as IT and data center monitoring. In this session we explore technology from the Microsoft SQL Server flight of products that covers these scenarios and addresses those requirements. The session discusses use cases in depth and explains how key components of the Microsoft All Data Platform can be used to build domain-specific solutions. As part of the session, we also go over various deployment alternatives and key dates of the product roadmap.
