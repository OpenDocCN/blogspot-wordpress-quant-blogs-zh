    up = VIX down and market down = VIX up. That’s all fine and dandy MOST of the
    time (I’m stating the obvious here) because of expectations about the asymmetry
    of volatility during bull versus bear moves. But how do we square moves like Monday
    (05/17) when, even though the close-to-close change in the market was very small,
    the intraday move was very large (with implications re: continued high volatility),
    yet the VIX still fell? Does the VIX (from a statistical correlation perspective)
    only care about close-to-close changes? Isn’t that a bit shallow?*'

    large 3.24%, the intraday range was a whopping 8.73%. So which was the better
    measure of volatility on that day? My guess is that anyone who was watching the
    markets as they crashed would vote for the 8.73% move, as things certainly felt
    more like the panic of October 2008 than the relative calm of October 2007.

    from options prices, in theory the VIX does not strictly account for intraday
    prices. Also, technically the VIX is the market's forward estimate of close-to-close
    volatility in the SPX. So from a pure statistical perspective, the VIX does indeed
    have a narrow close-to-close time horizon and is blind to intraday fluctuations
    in prices.

    number will typically reinforce the idea that the market is ripe for large volatility
    moves, even if these moves may cancel each other out on intraday basis. In my
    opinion, mapping these changes in price to changes in volatility is where fundamental
    factors and path dependency come into play. If stocks go up 3% intraday, for example,
    then fall back to even due to news that, say, the government had to prop up a
    U.K. bank,

    more volatility in the next 30 days. On the other hand, if stocks start the day
    down 3%, but closed even following news that lots of jobs were created, housing
    prices are increasing, the euro rallied to 1.30, etc., then I would expect the
    VIX to price in less volatility in the next 30 days.

    a neutral close. So while the VIX is really estimating what historical close-to-close
    volatility will be 30 days hence, the presence of wide intraday moves almost necessarily
    forces options traders to consider increasing their estimates of the probability
    and/or magnitude of large market moves going forward.

    was that on Friday skittish investors bought so much portfolio insurance that
    the VIX priced in the possibility of a very large volatility event. When Monday's
    reality fell short of Friday's worst fears, the VIX began to fall.
