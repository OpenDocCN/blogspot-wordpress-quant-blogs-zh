# VIX and More: VIX:VXV Ratio at New End of Day High

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/09/vixvxv-ratio-at-new-end-of-day-high.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/09/vixvxv-ratio-at-new-end-of-day-high.html#0001-01-01)

As far as I know, I was the first person to show interest in the [VXV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXV) as a market timing indicator and the first to talk about the [VIX:VXV ratio](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%3AVXV) when I posted on these subjects back in early December in [The VIX:VXV Ratio](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/12/vixvxv-ratio.html).

Fast forward nine months and the VIX:VXV ratio has an admirable market timing record and a very strong following, here and elsewhere. Last night it set a new end of day high when the ratio closed at 1.20\. So far, readings of 1.08 and above have been good long entry points. Using the same logic, a long entry at 1.20 should be an even better trade. I will be interested to see how last night’s signal turns out.
