- en: Over several time horizons op-ex week in December has been the most bullish
    week of the year for the SPX.  The positive seasonality actually has persisted
    for up to 3 weeks.  I showed this last year in the 12/12/11 blog.  I’ve updated
    that study below to include last year’s stats.

    still appear extremely strong.
