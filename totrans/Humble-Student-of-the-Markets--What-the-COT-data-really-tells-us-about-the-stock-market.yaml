    positions on SP 500 E-mini futures, meaning these folks were betting that stock
    prices would fall.

- en: By implication, traders are in a crowded short and the stock market is likely
    to rise. The chart from UBS is shown below. I have annotated past "crowded short"
    readings in red and "crowded long" readings in green. Can anyone seriously tell
    me that they want to use this Commitment of Traders (COT) data to trade the stock
    market? First of all, the CRTC has three broad classifications for traders, namely
    hedgers, or commercials, large speculators (institutions and hedge funds) and
    small speculators (mostly individuals). It is unclear whether the "traders" referred
    to in the UBS report are large speculators, small speculators, or both.

    useless for calling market direction. However, large speculator and leveraged
    position (read: hedge funds) positions on the NASDAQ 100 (NQ) contract was a reasonable
    contarian indicator. The most likely reason is that the fast money uses NQ positions
    to make market direction bets as the NASDAQ 100 is perceived to be a high beta
    index.'

- en: Currently, large speculators and hedge funds have started to unwind what was
    a crowded long position. As this data is reported weekly and with a lag, it is
    unclear how the COT data has shifted as the SPX has achieved an all-time high.
