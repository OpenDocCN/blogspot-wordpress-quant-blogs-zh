- en: Employment days have an interesting history and they have contributed to some
    worthwhile studies over the years. Below is a chart of SPY performance on Employment
    Days. For this equity curve I filtered to only include days where SPY was > its
    200ma. Each trade was a fictional $100k.

- en: What I find so interesting about the chart is that for a long time Employment
    Days in uptrends showed a strong propensity for gains. But in 2000 this edge vanished.
    Since then there has been no apparent advantage – bullish or bearish.
