    Minister Netanyahu against attacking Iran, he will not do it. This could simply
    be the familiar syndrome of telling the President what they believe he wants to

    markets. Let me re-phrase my beliefs. War would likely be bearish if America was
    to spend more blood and treasure getting caught in another quagmire. War would
    be bullish for the US economy if Americans followed the 19th Century imperialist
    model of "looting" conquered lands - which could happen if Americans controlled
    the major oil producing regions in the Middle East. I am not passing judgment
    on whether such a course would be right or wrong, but just stating my assessment
    of the likely consequences of war.'

- en: The Chinese economy is changing. There’s no question that companies that continue
    to rely on cheap labor to produce low-value, commodity goods — like those ones
    Andrew describes in his article — will increasingly feel the squeeze. As forward-looking
    companies pay more to deliver greater value-add, the opportunity cost of employing
    labor rises. That’s good for the economy, and for standards of living, but it
    means companies that remain stagnant must pay more just to do what they were already
    doing. With razor-thin margins based purely on eking out lower costs, many will
    go under.
