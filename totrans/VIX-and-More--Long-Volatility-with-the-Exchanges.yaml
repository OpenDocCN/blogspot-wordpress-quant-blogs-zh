    the rush to capitalize on the sudden volatility in the markets, many have jumped
    in to buy VIX calls not fully realizing what they were getting in to.  [Adam Warner](http://adamsoptions.blogspot.com/)
    summarizes [Barron’s take](http://adamsoptions.blogspot.com/2007/03/scary-market-week-2.html)
    on some of the shortcomings of VIX options as an investment vehicle and [reiterates](http://adamsoptions.blogspot.com/2007/03/look-at-vix-options.html)
    his [own perspective](http://adamsoptions.blogspot.com/2007/03/vix-contracts.html),
    which is essentially that the more sensible and direct play is SPY options.  For
    the record, I am in agreement here and have stated some [other reasons](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/02/how-to-think-about-day-after-executive_27.html)
    why VIX options may not be appropriate for all by the most experienced options
    traders.'

    ETFs:  the exchanges.  CME just [reported record options volume in February](http://www.cme.com/about/press/cn/06-27FebVolumeRelease17440.html)
    and will likely continue to be a beneficiary as concerns about increased risk
    and volatility create new demand for derivatives to reduce risk and volatility
    going forward.  This morning, CME is down more than 50 points from the January
    high of 596.'

    had a [strong February](http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176358&p=irol-IRnewsArticle&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;ID=968988&highlight=),
    but has more question marks than its larger rivals.  ISE is down about 12% since
    February 23^(rd) and may be an attractive takeover target.
