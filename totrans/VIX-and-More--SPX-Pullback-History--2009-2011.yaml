- en: Since there has been only one significant pullback in stocks so far in 2011,
    I am taking the mild selling from the last two days as an excuse to update a table
    of pullbacks that I have been updating periodically since stocks bottomed back
    in March 2009.

- en: The table captures some of the details of the fifteen significant (in magnitude
    and/or duration) pullbacks in the SPX during the last 26 months, with the current
    pullback – so far at only 1.5% from peak to trough – highlighted in yellow.

- en: Not counting the current 1.5% dip, the mean pullback has been 6.5% from the
    peak, with the median coming in at 5.6%. Using these numbers, a median pullback
    would take the SPX down to about 1294 and a mean pullback would drop the index
    down to a little over 1286.

- en: A pullback that matches the 17.1% drop from April to June 2010, which is the
    largest during this bull market, would drop the SPX back all the way to 1136.

- en: As you think about the current selling and the recent propensity for buy-on-the-dip
    investors to keep most pullbacks from becoming too severe, this bit of historical
    benchmarking should be able to serve as a guideline for evaluating how deep and
    how long the next pullback might extend.
