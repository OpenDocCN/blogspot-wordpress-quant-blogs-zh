- en: The track records of these surveys are awful. In 2005, the NRF forecast a 22
    percent increase in holiday shopping gains for the Thanksgiving weekend. Full
    holiday retail sales were up just 1 percent. In 2006, it was 18.9 percent sales
    increase, versus less than 5 percent actual gains. In 2007, a 4 percent gain was
    actually a 0.4 percent drop. NRF forecasts for 2008 were even worse, 2.2 percent
    sales gain versus a drop of 6 percent.

    Survey for holiday shopping -- it forecast a stunning 43 percent fall versus actual
    sales, which were up about 3 percent.

    stockcharts.com and came up with the following for the Retailing ETF (XRT).

- en: Retailing stocks tend to underperform the market in December. An analysis of
    the less liquid RTH, which had a 13 year history compared to XRT's 8 year history,
    showed that retailing stocks only outperformed SPY 25% of the time in December
    (though it outperformed 54% of the time in November). I have also seen other studies
    that indicate that this stock group tends to peak out about US Thanksgiving.
