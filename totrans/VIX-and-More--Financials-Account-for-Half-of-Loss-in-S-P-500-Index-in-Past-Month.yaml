    it interesting to note half of the losses in the S&P 500 index over the course
    of the past month can be attributed to the financial sector ([XLF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLF)).

- en: The chart below shows that while financials have fallen almost 21% during the
    last month, the other major industry sectors have come close to breaking even.
    Remove financials from the equation and only industrials ([XLI](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLI))
    have lost 3% during this period.

    financials on other sectors may have already peaked. This is not to say the market
    can rally without financials, but it is becoming increasingly difficult for the
    financial sector to drag the entire market down.
