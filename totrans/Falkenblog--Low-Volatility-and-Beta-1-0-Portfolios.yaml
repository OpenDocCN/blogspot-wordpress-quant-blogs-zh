    have found that using a 3-4 factor model to minimize variance generates the lowest
    volatility portfolios, but the advantage to this approach is 2-4% annualized volatility,
    and given most investors do not understand factor analysis, merely taking the
    lowest volatility or beta stocks, generates a decent approximation while retaining
    a great deal more intelligibility. The alternative I proposed yesterday was the
    beta 1.0 portfolio. The difference low volatility and beta 1.0 approaches is shown

    2-4%，鉴于大多数投资者不理解因子分析，仅仅选择波动率或 beta 最低的股票能得到一个相当不错的近似值，同时也保留了更多的可读性。我昨天提出的另一种方法是

    6 month I estimated betas for every US stock listed that had a sufficiently high
    market cap (about 2500 stocks), and monitored the return, putting merged or delisted
    stocks back into the index. Data are from CRSP, Compustat, and Bloomberg, and
    when constructed over the past, they include dead companies, so this is a survivorship
    free dataset. Prior to 1997, I used monthly returns, after that, daily returns
    in estimating betas. The beta 1.0 portfolio has had a portfolio beta very near
    1.0 in real time (about 1.05). The low beta portfolio merely took the lowest 100
    beta stocks (dark blue obs) every six months, doing the same thing.

  zh: Beta 1.0 只是选择那些 beta 最接近 1.0 的股票。也就是说，每 6 个月我估算一次所有美国上市股票的 beta 值(约 2500 只股票)，并监测回报，将合并或退市股票重新纳入指数。数据来自
    CRSP，Compustat 和 Bloomberg，当过去构建时，包含了已死亡公司，所以这是一个无生存偏差的数据集。1997 年之前，我使用月回报，之后则使用每日回报来估算
    beta 值。beta 1.0 投资组合实时的投资组合 beta 值非常接近 1.0（大约为 1.05）。低 beta 投资组合仅仅每 6 个月选择最低的
    100 个 beta 股票（深蓝色圆圈），做同样的事情。

    the underperformance of the Dimensional Fund Advisors small-cap portfolio against
    the S&P500 for 6 years in a row was evidence of its risk. But smaller stocks actually
    had comparable total returns, and higher returns relative to the risk-free rate,
    in the 1980‘s compared to the 1970‘s. It was only relative to their benchmark
    (the S&P500, large cap stocks) that they had ‘poor‘ returns’ highlighting that
    even Fama and Miller’s practical intuition on risk is purely relative, and these
    are champions of the standard model. Needless to say, other people, especially
