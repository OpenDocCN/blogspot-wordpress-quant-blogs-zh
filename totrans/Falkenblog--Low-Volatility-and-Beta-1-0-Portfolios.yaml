    have found that using a 3-4 factor model to minimize variance generates the lowest
    volatility portfolios, but the advantage to this approach is 2-4% annualized volatility,
    and given most investors do not understand factor analysis, merely taking the
    lowest volatility or beta stocks, generates a decent approximation while retaining
    a great deal more intelligibility. The alternative I proposed yesterday was the
    beta 1.0 portfolio. The difference low volatility and beta 1.0 approaches is shown
    below:'

    6 month I estimated betas for every US stock listed that had a sufficiently high
    market cap (about 2500 stocks), and monitored the return, putting merged or delisted
    stocks back into the index. Data are from CRSP, Compustat, and Bloomberg, and
    when constructed over the past, they include dead companies, so this is a survivorship
    free dataset. Prior to 1997, I used monthly returns, after that, daily returns
    in estimating betas. The beta 1.0 portfolio has had a portfolio beta very near
    1.0 in real time (about 1.05). The low beta portfolio merely took the lowest 100
    beta stocks (dark blue obs) every six months, doing the same thing.

    Schools, they should invest in low volatility or low beta portfolios. You can
    get a much lower 'risk' at about the same return, perhaps even a little higher.
    Merely cutting out the high volatility stocks generates a better return too, which
    is why low volatility portfolios, such as

    (and a slightly higher volatility). This is not really surprising, in the the
    perverse volatility effect is generallly that high volatility or beta stocks underperform
    massively. From low to mid beta, you actually get a modest return improvement.

    beta portfolio compared to the beta 1.0 portfolio. 'Low risk' is risky if you
    are benchmarking against the index. This was especially pronounced in the tech
    bubble of 2000 (below), when high beta stocks greatly outperformed, and anyone
    incidentally plying a low beta stocks probably lost their jobs (unless they were
    Warren Buffet, who survived tech underperformance).

    the Beta 1.0 portfolio is a smart alternative to the low volatility approach,
    which has as its greatest advantage avoiding those lousy lottery-ticket stocks
    that over the long run have proven disastrous across every major equity market.

    the underperformance of the Dimensional Fund Advisors small-cap portfolio against
    the S&P500 for 6 years in a row was evidence of its risk. But smaller stocks actually
    had comparable total returns, and higher returns relative to the risk-free rate,
    in the 1980‘s compared to the 1970‘s. It was only relative to their benchmark
    (the S&P500, large cap stocks) that they had ‘poor‘ returns’ highlighting that
    even Fama and Miller’s practical intuition on risk is purely relative, and these
    are champions of the standard model. Needless to say, other people, especially
    fund managers, are keenly aware of their year and life-to-date performance relative
    to the S&P500\.

    risk is a variation in return relative to a benchmark. This fact has several important
    implications for investing optimally, whether you act that way or not.
