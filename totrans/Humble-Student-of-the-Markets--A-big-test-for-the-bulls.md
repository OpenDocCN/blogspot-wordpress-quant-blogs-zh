# Humble Student of the Markets: A big test for the bulls

Wow! When I wrote about the likelihood of a

[sideways consolidation yesterday](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2011/10/sideways-consolidation-before-next.html)

, I never dreamed that the markets would rally to the top of the trading range so quickly. As the chart of SPY below shows, it was a big follow-through day on low volume, which is not a typical sign of the start of a bullish impulse. True, volume was low because of the Columbus Day semi-holiday, but it was nevertheless a low volume follow-through (see my previous comment

 about the O'Neill technique for spotting technical confirmations of market bottoms). Moreover, the market appears to be approaching a resistance zone where it has failed in the past.

Looking at the Euro STOXX 50, it too shows a similar pattern of approaching a resistance zone.

Yields on long Treasuries are also nearing a resistance area. In this case, they are nearing a downtrend that began in August, which remains intact.

Similarly, the VIX Index is approaching a support level, indicating that equities may have difficulty advancing from current levels.

Even if this were a genuine upleg, I don't believe that the market is likely to overcome resistance in the near term, largely because of the low volume nature of the move and a stunning reversal in sentiment.

**A stunning reversal in sentiment**

Further to my post yesterday that indicated

[no signs of capitulation from sentiment models](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2011/10/no-signs-of-capitulation-from-sentiment.html)

, I awoke on Monday morning to see the

[Ticker Sense Sentiment Poll](http://tickersense.typepad.com/ticker_sense/2011/10/october-10th-blogger-sentiment-poll.html)

, to which I am a participant*, show that over 50% of bloggers are bullish.

Contrast that with the readings from the

[previous week](http://tickersense.typepad.com/ticker_sense/2011/10/october-3rd-blogger-sentiment-poll.html)

showing over 50% bearish:

My inner trader wants to start legging into some short positions at current levels with carefully defined stop losses as he believes that the downside risk from putting on shorts is likely to be limited.

* For the record: My vote, which has been based on the readings of the

[Asset Inflation-Deflation Timer Model](http://qwestfunds.com/publications/newsletters_pdf/newsletter_november_2009.pdf)

, were bearish for the both weeks in question.
