    shingle and start a hedge fund; charge 2% and 20%; and get enormously wealthy.
    Many did.

    is flat this year, through May, according to Hedge Fund Research. That beats the
    decline of 3.80% in the Standard & Poor's 500 in that period, though it's below
    the gain of 0.94% in the Lehman Brothers bond index. Last year, the average hedge
    fund gained 10%, compared with returns of 5.5% for the S&P 500 and 7.8% for the
    Lehman index.

    risk-return characteristics, usually returns that are similar to their other asset
    classes but at a lower level of correlation. Today we have an industry delivering
    returns that are highly correlated to equities, but their justification for keeping
    their jobs is that they outperformed the S&P500??? If that the case, how about
    institutional equity-like fees (say 50 basis points)?
