    While 2012 was the first year since 2006 that the VIX failed to make it out of
    the 20s, this was not due to an absence of threats to the stock market.

    most investors, with the events surrounding the two nail-biting elections in [Greece](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Greece)
    haunting the markets from April through June. With Greece off of the front page,
    focus of the [European sovereign debt crisis](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/European%20sovereign%20debt%20crisis)
    shifted to unsustainable government debt yields in [Spain](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Spain)
    and [Italy](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Italy), which only began
    to turn around after Mario Draghi pledged to do “whatever it takes” to save the
    [euro](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/euro) in July.

    intervention of the Fed, which offered up QE 2.5, QE3 and QE4\. The global economy
    also found support in the form of central bank stimulus plans from [China](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/China),
    Japan and the euro zone.

    which was largely overlooked during the U.S. elections, but dominated the headlines
    even before the last vote was counted. The fiscal cliff issue remained the [#1
    source of concern for investors](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2012/12/just-change-of-venue-fears-about-us.html)
    throughout the balance of the year and had the VIX moving counter to its usual
    direction for most of December.
