- en: Even though there are a lot of things to be desired about working at Morgan
    Stanley, I must say that they have got the right idea about lessening their reliance
    on vendors. Their EIA group has their own XML-based pub/sub message bus (CPS),
    their own market data infrastructure (Filter), their own .NET client-side framework,
    and more. What they have done is cut companies like Tibco out of the loop, and
    are no longer beholden to vendor release cycles, upgrade fees, and huge licensing
    costs. Morgan owns the source, and has the staff to maintain and enhace their
    IP. In fact, a friend of mine at Morgan told me that, if they wanted to, Morgan
    could take CPS and give Tibco a run for their money.
