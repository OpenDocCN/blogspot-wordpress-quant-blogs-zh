    reacted to his press conference answer that the Fed could begin lessening its
    rate of bond purchases in the next few months, and that he would attempt to sooth
    the market in yesterday’s press conference following the FOMC meeting. Well, he
    tried, but ended up making things worse, at least in the perception of the markets.

    parameters for reducing and eventually eliminating the latest bond purchase program
    that, until recently, was assumed by the market to be open-ended. He further took
    pains to assure the markets that just reducing the amount of purchases was not
    the same as tightening and that the fed funds rate would not likely be increased
    before early in 2015\. He also assured one and all that the decisions would still
    be data-dependent, and subject to adjustment.

    to mean greater hawkishness, and, as a result, bond yields soared as stocks tanked.
    In addition the markets gave far greater importance to the potential reduction
    of bond purchases, whereas the Fed attached greater significance to the continuing
    expansion of their balance sheet.

    with its communications policy. Remember what the intent of the various quantitative
    easing programs were designed to do. The intent of QE is to lower interest rates,
    lower the cost of capital and lower the risk premium. In the wake of the Lehman
    Crisis of 2008, the Fed stepped in with QE1\. It followed with QE2 and QE3, otherwise
    known as QE-Infinity. The Fed first lowered short rates, told the market that
    it was holding short rates down for a very long, long time. It then followed up
    with purchases of Treasuries further out on the yield curve and later started
    to buy Agencies as well in order.

    taking meant that businesses would expand, buy more equipment, hire workers, etc.

    and holding them low for a long time. That is, in essence, a signal to borrow
    short and lend long. In the summer of 2009, T-Bills were yielding roughly 0.5%
    and 10-year Treasuries were roughly 3.5%. If the bank were to borrow short and
    lend long with Treasury securities (no credit risk), it could get a spread of
    roughly 3%. Lever that trade up a "conservative" 10 times and you get a 30% return.
    20 times leverages gets you 60% return. Pretty soon, you've made a ton of money
    to repair your balance sheet.

    this trade. Pretty soon, you saw the whole world reaching for yield. The game
    was to borrow short and lend either long or to lower credits. Carry trades of
    various flavors exploded. There were currency carry trades, some went into junk
    bonds, others started buying emerging market paper. You get the idea.

    the board. The equity risk premium compressed and the stock market soared. Credit

    how the Fed manages to exit from its QE program and ZIRP. We all knew that the
    day would have to come sooner or later. So on May 22, 2013, Ben Bernanke stated

    policies. ***In particular, we confirm a potentially important role for central
    bank communications to try to shape public expectations of future policy actions***.
    Like Gürkaynak, Sack, and Swanson (2004), we find that the Federal Reserve’s monetary
    policy decisions have two distinct effects on asset prices. These factors represent,
    respectively, (1) the unexpected change in the current setting of the federal
    funds rate, and (2) the change in market expectations about the trajectory of
    the funds rate over the next year that is not explained by the current policy
    action. In the United States, the second factor, in particular, appears strongly
    linked to Fed policy statements, probably reflecting the importance of communication
    by the central bank. If central bank “talk” affects policy expectations, then
    policymakers retain some leverage over long-term yields, even if the current policy
    rate is at or near zero.

    much on the timing and mechanics of "tapering" and not on the meta-message from
    the Fed. If quantitative easing is meant to lower interest rates and lower the
    risk premium, then a withdrawal of QE reverses that process.

    I give Berananke an A+ for shaking off the market complacency that came to dominate
    the market thought process of the first four months of the year (to the point
    where the bubbleheads on bubblevision were counting consecutive Tuesdays for Dow

    Fed won't be pushing you to take as much risk. Consider what this means for stocks.
    If the economy does truly take off and earnings grow, then stock prices can rise.
    However, don't expect stock prices to rise because P/Es are going to go up because
    the Fed is pushing the market to take more risk. In fact, P/Es are more likely
    to fall and it will be up the the E component of that ratio, namely earnings,
    to do the heavy lifting.

    when S+P 500 companies reported an aggregate revenue growth rate of 0.0%, the
    consensus currently calls for 1.8% growth in the second quarter. With revenue
    growth holding back earnings for the past several quarters, we did an evaluation
    of company management teams’ outlooks for their revenues. Over the time period
    evaluated, Q1 2008–present, revenue preannouncements were more balanced than were
    EPS preannouncements. On average, there were 1.7 negative revenue preannouncements
    for each positive one. This compares with an N/P ratio of 2.4 for EPS over the
    same period.
