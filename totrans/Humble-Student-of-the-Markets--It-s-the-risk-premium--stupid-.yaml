    with its communications policy. Remember what the intent of the various quantitative
    easing programs were designed to do. The intent of QE is to lower interest rates,
    lower the cost of capital and lower the risk premium. In the wake of the Lehman
    Crisis of 2008, the Fed stepped in with QE1\. It followed with QE2 and QE3, otherwise
    known as QE-Infinity. The Fed first lowered short rates, told the market that
    it was holding short rates down for a very long, long time. It then followed up
    with purchases of Treasuries further out on the yield curve and later started
    to buy Agencies as well in order.

    and 10-year Treasuries were roughly 3.5%. If the bank were to borrow short and

    policies. ***In particular, we confirm a potentially important role for central
    bank communications to try to shape public expectations of future policy actions***.
    Like Gürkaynak, Sack, and Swanson (2004), we find that the Federal Reserve’s monetary
    policy decisions have two distinct effects on asset prices. These factors represent,
    respectively, (1) the unexpected change in the current setting of the federal
    funds rate, and (2) the change in market expectations about the trajectory of
    the funds rate over the next year that is not explained by the current policy
    action. In the United States, the second factor, in particular, appears strongly
    linked to Fed policy statements, probably reflecting the importance of communication
    by the central bank. If central bank “talk” affects policy expectations, then
    policymakers retain some leverage over long-term yields, even if the current policy
    rate is at or near zero.
