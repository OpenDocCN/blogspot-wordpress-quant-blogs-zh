    cliche. It''s the standard trope about the superior virtues of a primitive, indigeounous
    culture. The funny thing is that everyone knows primitive indigenous white cultures,
    such as those in Appalachia (rural America), are backward: illiterate, racist,
    sexist, and homophobic. The have high rates of crime, drug use, and incest. Their
    religiosity is not admirable, it merely highlights their devotion to dogma. However,
    given the current enlightened tribalism white trash has no analogue among brown,
    black, yellow and now blue hominids. I guess the marginal effect of education
    on rational self-interest is high only for Europeans; everyone else simply knows
    that ''playing nice'' is an optimal strategy in dynamic interactions.'

    is that one usually has 100x the brainpower of the other. When one comes light
    years to visit the other, and you can put your money on the visitors, and remember,
    they are not only smart, but hungry. This is why I'm not too excited by the thought
    of aliens coming back, because I don't think they are going

    females of another species merely because they look and act kind of human. Sure,
    she's a pretty blue girl, but horses are pretty, and if they could talk, I still
    wouldn't fark one, even if "I" were a horse. I guess ever since Captain Kirk started
    making out with alien babes everyone figures a hot chick with a tail and racing
    stripes is just a hot chick. I'm all for being color blind, but if your neighbors
    are really blue, deep blue, don't tell me you'll treat them just like everyone
    else.
