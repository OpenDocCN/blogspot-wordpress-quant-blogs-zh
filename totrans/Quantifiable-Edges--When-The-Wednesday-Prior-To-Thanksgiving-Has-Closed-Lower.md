# Quantifiable Edges: When The Wednesday Prior To Thanksgiving Has Closed Lower

> 来源：[http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2011/11/when-wednesday-prior-to-thanksgiving.html#0001-01-01](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2011/11/when-wednesday-prior-to-thanksgiving.html#0001-01-01)

It appears the market is going to buck historical tendencies today and close down.  This will be the 11th time since 1960 that the SPX has closed lower on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving.  Below I have listed the other 10 instances along with the SPX performance on Friday (the day after Thanksgiving).

The 2 instances that I have circled are the only 2 where the SPX closed the Wednesday before Thanksgiving down over 1%.

For what it's worth I would note that statistics associated with these 10 instances (win %, profit factor, avg. gain, etc) are pretty much in line with all Fridays after Thanksgiving.  (It has generally been bullish.)
