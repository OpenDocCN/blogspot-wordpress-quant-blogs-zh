- en: 'One subject matter that is noticeably absent in the quantitative blogosphere
    is the measurement and use of inter-market variables for market prediction. Inter-market
    variables can be defined primarily as any major market(s) that is/are likely to
    affect an  individual market or stock such as interest rates, currencies, and
    commodities to name a few.  The primary reason inter-market research is absent
    from much of the research is because-excepting interest rates-there do not appear
    to be any clear and consistent effects that forecast the S&P500 in the short-term
    over time. As a consequence, this area has been largely untouched yet fertile
    ground. Frank Hassler recently wrote a good article about using sector returns
    to predict the SPY: [http://engineering-returns.com/2010/08/08/spy-xlv-xlu-sector-performance/](http://engineering-returns.com/2010/08/08/spy-xlv-xlu-sector-performance/).
    This article showed essentially that when defensive sectors are falling, the S&P500
    does better the next day which probably reflects sentiment factors (investors
    dumping defensive issues) versus inter-market –though there may be a relationship
    between XLU and interest rates affecting returns in this case also.'

  zh: 在定量博客圈中明显缺失的一个主题是跨市场变量用于市场预测的测量和应用。跨市场变量主要可以定义为任何可能影响个体市场或股票的主要市场，如利率、货币和商品等。跨市场研究在很大程度上未被研究的原因主要是，除了利率，似乎没有清晰一致的效果可以预测短期内的标普500。因此，这一领域一直未受关注，但却是一片沃土。Frank
    Hassler最近写了一篇关于使用板块回报预测SPY的好文章：[http://engineering-returns.com/2010/08/08/spy-xlv-xlu-sector-performance/](http://engineering-returns.com/2010/08/08/spy-xlv-xlu-sector-performance/)。这篇文章基本上表明，当防守板块下跌时，标普500第二天表现更好，这可能反映了情绪因素（投资者抛售防守性股票）而非跨市场因素——尽管在这种情况下XLU和利率之间的关系也可能影响回报。
- en: The last two years highlights the importance of inter-market factors on the
    market, yet so far few have applied the immense potential of this approach to
    date. After running hundreds of backtests spanning many different types of tests
    using technical variables it became obvious to me that certain time periods were
    difficult for technical factors regardless of the approach. Once I started testing
    inter-market variables it became immediately apparent that these same difficult
    time periods were handled exceptionally well using  this approach. My intial conclusion
    is that during certain periods the inter-market variables are far more important
    than taking advantage of feedback loops or sentiment. This is especially true
    with individual stocks, which tend to provide an enormous opportunity to gain
    or reduce leverage to such effects when the timing is right.

  zh: 过去的两年突显了跨市场因素对市场的重要性，然而到目前为止，很少有人应用这种方法的巨大潜力。在使用了数百个回测，涵盖了多种技术变量的不同类型的测试之后，我明显地发现，在某些时期，不管采用何种方法，技术因素都显得困难。一旦我开始测试跨市场变量，立即就很明显地看出，同样的困难时期使用这种方法可以处理得非常好。我的初步结论是，在某些时期，跨市场变量比利用反馈循环或情绪更重要。这在个股上尤其真实，当时机成熟时，它们往往能提供巨大的机会来获得或减少对这种效果的杠杆。
- en: It is my opinion that most quants in general have too much of a bias towards
    very long-term backtests (greater than 10-years)–and in no other area does this
    distort research initiatives more than the field of inter-market effects. The
    major problem with inter-market effects is that they are always changing depending
    on the economic environment. In contrast most mean-reversion/trend or price effects
    relate to biases in human behavior which tends to be far more consistent over
    time.  Every decade brings a new economy with new market players and salient factors
    that only echo past economic situations to a minor degree. In some decades the
    US dollar is strong and no one is worried about deficits, while inflation might
    be a concern. In other decades the dollar is weak and people are worried about
    deficits and the specter of deflation.  In other cases the relationships may be
    somewhere in between or completely unique. Truthfully, the cycles of economic
    themes are much faster than just a 10-year window, and can change multiple times
    in the interim. This is because Fed policy and government intervention can change
    the direction of certain variables, and their effect on the markets can be either
    highly temporary or sometimes longer-term. In either case there are a lot of factors
    at work, and a dynamic approach is absolutely necessary. The problem with trying
    to find effects over a decade or longer is that you end up averaging  out effects
    that have changed direction but were exceptionally strong and predictable in the
    short-term. To be able to capture inter-market effects you have to track things
    on a rolling basis over much shorter windows. This is a far cry from the long-term
    and static back-testing that most quants are used to doing. My advice is that
    inter-market effects can be discovered and applied effectively using only a few
    years of data history, and in some cases much less. That said, teasing out these
    effects and their correlations with other inter-market variables can be a tricky
    exercise. Furthermore data pre-processing becomes a much more significant issue.
    Still, it is a brave new world out there–perhaps researchers will heed my humble
    advice and do some homework in this area.

  zh: 在我看来，大多数量化分析师通常过于偏爱非常长期的回测（超过10年）——而在其他领域，这种偏好对研究倡议的扭曲程度超过了对跨市场效应领域的扭曲。跨市场效应的主要问题是它们总是随着经济环境的变化而变化。相比之下，大多数均值回归/趋势或价格效应与人类行为偏差有关，这些偏差在长时间内通常更加一致。每个十年都会带来一个新经济，新的市场参与者和突出的因素，这些因素只是在过去经济状况中起到了很小程度的回声。在某些十年中，美元强劲，没有人担心赤字，而通货膨胀可能成为一个问题。在其他的十年中，美元疲软，人们担心赤字和通货紧缩的幽灵。在其他情况下，这些关系可能介于两者之间或完全独特。坦白说，经济主题的周期远比10年窗口要快，并且在其间可能会多次发生变化。这是因为美联储政策和政府干预可以改变某些变量的方向，它们对市场的效果可能是非常暂时的，有时可能是长期的。无论如何，有很多因素在起作用，绝对需要一种动态的方法。尝试在十年或更长时间内寻找效应的问题在于，你最终平均了在短期内非常强劲和可预测但方向已发生变化的效应。为了能够捕捉跨市场效应，你必须滚动跟踪在更短时间窗口内的事物。这与大多数量化分析师习惯做的长期静态回测相去甚远。我的建议是，仅使用几年的数据历史就可以发现并有效应用跨市场效应，在某些情况下，所需的时间会更短。话说回来，分离这些效应及其与其他跨市场变量的相关性可能是一项棘手的任务。此外，数据预处理成为一个更为重要的问题。然而，外面的世界充满了未知——也许研究人员会听从我的谦逊建议，在这个领域做一些功课。
