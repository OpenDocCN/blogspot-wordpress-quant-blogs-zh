    these sort of things.  The trick, as always, is in detecting with a minimum of
    lag, determining the window of analysis, and technique.

- en: The signal is decomposed into wavelet-like bases.   The power of the bases is
    evaluated to determine which base carries the most power.   The most powerful
    base is the most representative of the market direction and mode.   This approach
    is sensitive to window.  May work well with volatility inverse scaled window size.

    etc.   How does one adjust or choose the MA window?

    the technicals approach is that each of the states implies a different distribution,
    so depending on what mode you are in, one selects the appropriate distribution
    (or a blend thereof for a fuzzy approach).**

    is dense or continuous this is relatively straightforward to do.   For a dense
    empirical distribution one could project a smoothing kernel and solve for maximum
    points by setting the derivative to 0.

    of local maxima requires either a judgement call and/or cross validation against
    model performance.

    is a much more difficult.   It occurred to me that one of the machine-learning
    clustering algorithms may be the best approach here.   K-means is one such algorithm.
      I have not yet investigated the efficacy of the approach for my requirements,
    will post more later when I circle back on this one.

    particularly as it can capture modes one may not even be aware of.   The statistical
    approach, however, does not attach any meaning to the modes.   In other words
    is an opaque model.   Perhaps a mix of determining what factors give rise to the
    modes via a clustering approach followed by codifying makes more sense.'
