- en: A major problem in politics is that it is not optimal for any party to say what
    they mean. People pound the table as to how innocuous a certain policy is, and
    how 'crazy' anyone must be to be against it. Others highlight a different endgame,
    a principle, or the insincerity of the policy. This is why Michael Kinsley famously
    said a 'gaffe' is when a politician accidentally says the truth. Ignorance, and
    bad faith, make truth-telling a dominated strategy.

- en: It is important to distinguish between private and public sphere here, as in
    my private life I can adopt a truth-telling strategy because when I encounter
    the ignorant and those of bad faith, I can simply avoid those neighbors and friends
    going forward. In contrast, one must build coalitions in public, and one cannot
    simply abstain from interacting with such parties. Thus, insincerity is needed
    much more in public contacts than private contacts [one still needs some insincerity
    in private, like saying 'your butt doesn't look big in that' to your spouse].

    rid of the minimum wage helps the poor or that giving people money to destroy
    old cars is a waste of money, is a complex assertion that takes an equilibrium
    argument, and is primarily theoretical. The benefits are seen and the costs are
    unseen. Alternatively, the idea that it is optimal for governments to have 5-year
    plans for industrial production at one time seemed obvious, based on the fact
    one plans before building a bridge. In this case, the error is not in undercounting
    the unseen, but a flawed analogy.

    but rather, see your immediate aim as not in the best interest of their overall
    plan, and so want to stop it at all costs. Your failure is not their direct aim,
    but rather, consistent with their objective. Their opposition can be direct ('no
    new taxes!), but it can also be indirect, helping the ignorant develop antipathy
    by clever caricature ('he wants to hurt small businesses!').

- en: Thus, people often speak in metaphors based on principles no one is against.
    For example, in litigation, when asked 'what is your endgame?', an honest response
    would state one's direct claim against the defendant. This would be a specific
    demand, but that presents a problem. Perhaps your endgame is something that an
    ignorant person would find highly dubious or self-serving if discovered. For example,
    you could merely want to effect a noncompete agreement, stifling a new competitor.
    Perhaps your endgame is costing your ex-employee a lot of money to signal to current
    employees the futility of trying to negotiate for more within the firm. Clearly,
    these are not sympathetic aims, even if your plan for crushing some plebes is
    part of a greater good via using your ultimate booty to fund a charity in Africa.
    So instead of saying something specific you say 'to protect our intellectual property
    and enforce valid contracts'. You start broad, and when pressed, get less broad,
    but always keep at a level where any Sunday school teacher would agree with your
    goals.

- en: In health care, I think the bottom line is that most people see this as a foot
    in the door to greater government control of a large segment of our economy, one
    that will be used for more egalitarian, and politicized, allocation of resources.
    Democrats in this country like egalitarian redistributions, and 'politicized'
    is just a pejorative for 'democratized'. Republicans emphasize the inefficiencies
    of egalitarian distributions, the violations of liberty. As health care is expensive
    and already highly regulated, it's sort of like the Balkans of historical Europe,
    a good place to start a fight on this more fundamental issue.

    someone wants, that makes what they say mean something very different. I think
    all people understand this at a deep level, which is why old people suffering
    from dementia have prominent paranoid beliefs about people wanting to 'get' them.
    They know that the intentions of people are very important, and this knowledge
    is deep in the cranium, not at the edge.

- en: In observing the public debate, one has to arrange one's argument in a way that
    makes it more likely the ignorant will be on your side because they are always
    a decisive block in any policy debate. As Keynes said, right policies are invariably
    chosen for the wrong reasons, so one must anticipate that. This makes a lot of
    discussion on these issues confusing, because some people are commenting on statements
    as if they were not part of a broader context.
