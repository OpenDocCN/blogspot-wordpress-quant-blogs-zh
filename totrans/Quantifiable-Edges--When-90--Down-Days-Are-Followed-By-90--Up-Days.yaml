    registered a 90%+ upside volume day. A 90% down followed by a 90% up day is something
    that was never seen from 1970 – 2006\. But this is the 10th time we’ve seen it
    happen since the beginning of 2007\. Below I have listed the previous 9 and shown
    how the SPX has fared the following day.

    a possible 1-day downside edge. The high downside risk vs the small upside reward
    makes the results especially compelling for the bears.
