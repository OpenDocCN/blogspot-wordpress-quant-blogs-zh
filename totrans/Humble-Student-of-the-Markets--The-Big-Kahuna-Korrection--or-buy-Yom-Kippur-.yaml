    a helmet. It is risky behavior in the long-run, but it may mean nothing in the
    short-term as the motorcyclist may not get in an accident. The second would be
    analogous to the motorcyclist riding around at 100 mph without the helmet. It
    raises the risk level considerably and the consequences would be dire if there
    is an accident. The third is are potholes in the road, or the catalyst for the
    bears to come out of hibernation.

    of potholes are getting more numerous, the motorcyclist hasn`t wiped out. European
    growth continues to slow. China is slowing and Beijing shows no immediate desire

    market breadth based technical indicators, These include the NYSE 52-week New
    Highs-New Lows, the NYSE McClellan Oscillator and the Percentage of stocks above
    the 200 day moving average, all of which are shown in the chart below.

    have all flashed oversold conditions at the same time that have have marked an
    interim market bottom. On the other hand, the red vertical lines show past instances
    when these threee oversold conditions have not marked a sustainable low, when
    the market rallied briefly and went on to decline again. Note the % of stocks
    above the 200 dma is unreliable as an oversold indicator as it is difficult to
    ascertain the level when it is deemed to be oversold.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In particular, this trifecta of oversold indicators were unsuccessful in calling
    the 2011 bottom as only the NYSE HL was the only indicator that flashed an oversold
    condition, while the McClellan Oscillator was not oversold and % of stocks above
    the 200 dma was unreliable as an oversold indicator.

    VIX term structure shows that option players are showing a high degree of fear
    and so does a TRIN reading greater than 2\. As the chart below shows, while TRIN
    rose above 2 last week, the VIX-VXV ratio as a measure of VIX term structure is
    far from inversion (shaded zone). As well, the absolute value of the VIX Index
    is still below previous points that have marked previous interim lows, which are
    shown by the vertical blue dotted lines when VIX-VXV rose above 1 and TRIN was
    above 2\. The charts in my previous post shows a longer history of the combination
    of these two indicators, which have had a 100% success in calling interim bottoms

    to see further downside before declaring an interim bottom. Indeed, other sentiment
    indicators such as Rydex funds flows, which measure funds committed, instead of
    investor opinions, are nearing crowded short readings, but they are not quite
    there yet.

    are jittery and panic easily. As a result, pullbacks have been extremely mild
    and less than 5% (whatever happened to the 10% correction?). If it were to sell
    off in the next few days, then the adage of buying on Yom Kippur might not be
    such a bad idea.
