    who monopolize the business media with their bullish rhetoric. Their tone is conservatively
    described as optimistic, and perhaps more realistically it sounds almost euphoric.
    After coming back from the brink of their complete demise, they are pounding the
    table with a little “I told you so!”  Remember one thing if you are a trader,
    you do NOT have to buy and hold. However, the mutual fund crew MUST buy and hold,
    and from a business perspective it is in their best interests to encourage investors
    and traders to do so. I for one believe this market is but a castle built in the
    air and ripe for a thrashing. That said, I am unwilling to go full bear here.
    I prefer to go in and out–long and short with little exposure and lots of cash
    at this point to reduce risk.  Renowned short-seller Doug Kass presents his view
    on the naiive optimism in the stock market: [http://www.cnbc.com/id/33887718](http://www.cnbc.com/id/33887718)'

- en: '**How to play it:** If you are long keep your trailing stops roughly 10% from
    the current closing price of the index, or 10% on each stock in your portfolio
    that is above its 50 day moving average. Aggressive investors can trim exposure
    here and wait for a pullback to re-enter, or they can short with a 5% stop to
    the upside with 10 or 20% exposure. In my opinion the 200 ma still serves as support,
    and until the 200 ma is broken decisively for at least a week to the downside,
    I wouldn’t take full short positions (ie net 50% short or higher).'
