    bearishness, which is contrarian bullish, I am concerned that there hasn't been
    enough capitulation for the market to make an intermediate bottom.

    individual clients asking if it's time to buy. That's generally not a sign that
    sentiment has been washed out and not the sign of a capitulation bottom.

    volume or selling) declined, narrowing the spread between distribution and accumulation.
    Since VIM remains negative and VIGOR continues to decline, this mild improvement
    in the VIM only supports the case for a tactical rally.
