# Timely Portfolio: Foreign Currencies and US 10y Treasury Yields

> 来源：[http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2012/01/foreign-currencies-and-us-10y-treasury.html#0001-01-01](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2012/01/foreign-currencies-and-us-10y-treasury.html#0001-01-01)

Since I explored the relationship between the [Japanese Yen and the US 10y Treasury Yield on Friday](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2012/01/are-we-japanese.html), I thought it might be worthwhile to extend the exploration to a much broader range of currencies. I personally am most interested on how Asian Central Bank manipulation has affected the US 10y yield, and how if that changes what might be the impact to world markets. Please let me know your thoughts.
