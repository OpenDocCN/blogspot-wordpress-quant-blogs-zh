    lows, while bull- and sector-fund assets mounted to their highest levels since
    the October 2007 market peak. Currently, he reports, there is roughly $7.50 in
    bull and sector funds for every $1 in bear-market fund assets, which he calls
    “the most ridiculously one-sided sentiment we have seen since the tech mania convinced
    folks that no price was too high to pay.”
