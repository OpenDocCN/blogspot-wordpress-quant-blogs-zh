    the Tribune reporter who wrote the piece.

    Gardens. She spent part of her own childhood in public housing, as a kid in the
    Washington Park Homes, as a teenager in Stateway Gardens. Like her parents, she
    attended college, then went on to earn a master's degree.

    of master's degrees isn't the same as a lack of morals.

    give anonymous people a microphone, and who would predict that it bring out massive
    incivility? This is why reputation matters and a system that monitors people,
    to validate a reputation, is essential. If people could act without accountability,
    like anonymous commenters, they would be rude and uncivil, because there is no
    downside to being an asshole when no one knows who you are. Similarly, tracking
    your payment history allows us to have credit cards, something not so common in
    Mexico, to say nothing of Haiti or Liberia. Big brother is too far, but there
    is moderation in all things.
