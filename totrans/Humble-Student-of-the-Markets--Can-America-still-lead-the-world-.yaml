    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    changes in the direction of the main Trend Model signal. A bullish Trend Model
    signal that gets less bullish is a trading "sell" signal. Conversely, a bearish
    Trend Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading "buy" signal. The history
    of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of the trading model are shown
    by the arrows in the chart below. The turnover rate of the trading model is high,
    and it has varied between 150% to 200% per month.

    The chart below shows that US stocks have been the only source of market leadership,
    which begs the question, "Can global stocks achieve new highs with only US stocks?"
    The chart below compares US, international developed markets (EAFE), and emerging
    market (EM) equities to the MSCI All-Country World Index (ACWI). US equities have
    been tracing out a saucer shaped base on a relative basis. EAFE have been weak
    in the past year, and they are testing a key relative support level. EM relative
    performance began to falter in late 2017, and relative strength has been rolling
    over.

    to propel global equities to new all-time highs? To answer that question, we take
    a tour around the world and analyze the macro and equity market outlooks of the
    three major trading blocs, the US, Europe, and China.
