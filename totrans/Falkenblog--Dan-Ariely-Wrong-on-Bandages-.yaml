    bandages, versus slow rips. He talks about lab experiments that proved ripping
    off slowly was 'better', than when you rip them off quickly. This was in contrast
    to the nurse intuition, and highlights that our intuitions are often incorrect.

    of random stuff. It makes for fun reading, as trivia books often are, but as to

    had two plasters applied to their upper arm, hand and ankle. The plasters were
    then removed using both fast and slow methods, with a randomisation process used
    to decide which was used first on each student. Subjects were asked to rate the
    pain on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 being the "worst pain imaginable".
