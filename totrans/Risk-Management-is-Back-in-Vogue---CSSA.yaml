- en: As human beings, we are by design our own worst enemies- especially when it
    comes to navigating the ups and downs of the market. The longer a person experiences
    prosperity and does not suffer any drawdowns, the less risky they perceive the
    market to be. The reverse is true after a person experiences large losses and
    severe drawdowns. After the equity market goes up significantly for years without
    a serious correction, most investors begin to forget about the importance of risk
    management. Typically the only risk they think of is keeping up with the returns
    of their peers- the fear of missing out on the gravy train. This causes investors
    to push to overweight stocks beyond both their required allocation for financial
    planning and also their inherent comfort level. Winners bet more than they should
    on stocks and losers bet less. No one wants to hear about tactical asset allocation
    when the market is going up- they would rather listen to stock tips from a “5-star”
    fund manager- or from their advisor. After a bear market, investors seek out the
    same tactical advisors they previously ignored, and tend to especially favor advisors
    with compelling bearish stories that resonate strongly with investor fear and
    skepticism. Of course they ignore “black-box” systematic strategies that are more
    likely to capture returns in the next bull market.

  zh: 作为人类，我们天生就是自己最大的敌人——尤其是在驾驭市场起伏方面。一个人经历的繁荣越长，没有遭受任何回撤，他们就越认为市场风险较低。反之，经历重大损失和严重回撤后，这种看法就会反转。在股票市场连续多年大幅上涨且没有严重调整之后，大多数投资者开始忘记风险管理的重要性。通常他们唯一考虑的风险是与同行保持收益竞争力——错失良机的恐惧。这导致投资者超出财务规划所需的股票配置比例以及他们内在的舒适区。在股票上投注过多的赢家和投注过少的输家。没有人想在市场上涨时听关于战术资产配置的内容——他们更愿意听取“五星”基金经理——或者他们的顾问的股票建议。在熊市之后，投资者会寻求之前忽视的相同战术顾问，并且特别倾向于那些与投资者恐惧和怀疑心态强烈共鸣的顾问，他们有引人注目的看跌故事。当然，他们会忽略在下一轮牛市中更有可能捕捉回报的“黑盒”系统性策略。
- en: 'The bottom line is that the longer an investor experiences a market state,
    the more comfortable that they become that it will last forever. The old saying
    about boiling a frog rings true: if you want to trick the frog, just start out
    with cold water and slowly bring things to a boil and it won’t jump out until
    its too late. The stock market demonstrates predictable long-term mean-reversion-
    the longer and higher something goes up, the more likely it will go down in the
    future. The result is that investors on balance badly underperform virtually any
    benchmark imaginable–even accounting for their chosen asset mix.'

  zh: 底线是，投资者经历的市场状态越长，他们就越会感到舒适并认为这种状态会永远持续。关于煮青蛙的老说法确实正确：如果你想欺骗青蛙，只需从冷水开始，然后慢慢把事情带到沸点，它会在太晚之前都不会跳出来。股市展现出可预测的长期均值回归——上涨越久越高，未来下跌的可能性就越大。结果是，投资者总体表现远远落后于任何可想象的基准——即使考虑到他们选择的资产组合。
- en: 'After a large and sharp market pullback, suddenly investors become alert to
    the realities of market risk. If you read a lot of the media these days, risk
    is the only topic that everyone wants to talk about. Risk management is suddenly
    back in vogue and no one wants to hear about the “bargain stocks” or “good deals”
    that their beloved fund managers are talking up on TV to rally support for the
    cult of equities (long equities only buy and hold). But we should all take a step
    back and consider that risk management is not a fashion fad, but rather should
    be a core staple in an investor’s portfolio. Managing risk not only protects an
    investor’s portfolio against market risk, it also helps to protect them from the
    greatest risk of all: themselves.'

  zh: 在经历了一次大幅的市场回调之后，投资者突然对市场风险有了警觉。如果你最近阅读了很多媒体内容，那么风险就成了每个人都想要讨论的唯一话题。风险管理突然又成了时尚，没有人想听关于他们所喜爱的基金经理在电视上大加推崇的“便宜股票”或者“好交易”。这些基金经理在电视上鼓吹支持股票（只买入并持有股票）。但我们大家都应该退后一步，考虑一下风险管理并非时尚潮流，而应该是投资者组合中的核心基础。管理风险不仅能保护投资者组合免受市场风险的侵害，还能帮助他们防范最大的风险：自己。
