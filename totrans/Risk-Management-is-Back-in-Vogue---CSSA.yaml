- en: As human beings, we are by design our own worst enemies- especially when it
    comes to navigating the ups and downs of the market. The longer a person experiences
    prosperity and does not suffer any drawdowns, the less risky they perceive the
    market to be. The reverse is true after a person experiences large losses and
    severe drawdowns. After the equity market goes up significantly for years without
    a serious correction, most investors begin to forget about the importance of risk
    management. Typically the only risk they think of is keeping up with the returns
    of their peers- the fear of missing out on the gravy train. This causes investors
    to push to overweight stocks beyond both their required allocation for financial
    planning and also their inherent comfort level. Winners bet more than they should
    on stocks and losers bet less. No one wants to hear about tactical asset allocation
    when the market is going up- they would rather listen to stock tips from a “5-star”
    fund manager- or from their advisor. After a bear market, investors seek out the
    same tactical advisors they previously ignored, and tend to especially favor advisors
    with compelling bearish stories that resonate strongly with investor fear and
    skepticism. Of course they ignore “black-box” systematic strategies that are more
    likely to capture returns in the next bull market.

    the more comfortable that they become that it will last forever. The old saying
    about boiling a frog rings true: if you want to trick the frog, just start out
    with cold water and slowly bring things to a boil and it won’t jump out until
    its too late. The stock market demonstrates predictable long-term mean-reversion-
    the longer and higher something goes up, the more likely it will go down in the
    future. The result is that investors on balance badly underperform virtually any
    benchmark imaginable–even accounting for their chosen asset mix.'

    the realities of market risk. If you read a lot of the media these days, risk
    is the only topic that everyone wants to talk about. Risk management is suddenly
    back in vogue and no one wants to hear about the “bargain stocks” or “good deals”
    that their beloved fund managers are talking up on TV to rally support for the
    cult of equities (long equities only buy and hold). But we should all take a step
    back and consider that risk management is not a fashion fad, but rather should
    be a core staple in an investor’s portfolio. Managing risk not only protects an
    investor’s portfolio against market risk, it also helps to protect them from the
    greatest risk of all: themselves.'
