    track record if one were to buy the market when the VIX made a new high.

    backward, the five most recent new highs came during a span of 8/27/98 to 10/8/98
    as the [Russian financial crisis](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Russian%20financial%20crisis)
    morphed into the [Long-Term Capital Management](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Long%20Term%20Capital%20Management)
    crisis. Prior to 1998, the most recent VIX high was from 10/30/97, during the
    [Asian financial crisis](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Asian%20financial%20crisis).

- en: 'Looking at data from the CBOE’s historical database, which goes back to the
    beginning of 1990, the next three VIX highs are from August 1990\. Scrolling back
    before the August highs, there are 11 highs in January 1990, including eight of
    the first ten trading days. In the chart below, I have omitted the noise from
    the first ten trading days and included only the last three VIX highs from the
    initial month of VIX data. While this leaves only ten data points, the pattern
    is clear: going long the SPX when the VIX makes a new high is an effective strategy,
    at least when the holding period is from 1 to 100 days. The mean return for the
    SPX following a VIX high, for instance, is about 2% ten days after the VIX high,
    while the mean return during all ten day periods for the SPX during the past 19
    years has been only 0.3%.'
