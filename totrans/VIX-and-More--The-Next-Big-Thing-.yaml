- en: This morning [ProShares](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/ProShares)
    launched two new triple ETFs. Now before you exclaim, “Enough already!” consider
    that the new ETFs are designed to track the daily moves of the S&P 500 index.
    As such, these are the first [3x and -3x ETFs](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/triple%20ETFs)
    that track the SPX directly. For this reason alone, the two new ETFs are can’t
    miss products. While these triple ETFs will have some interesting hedging applications,
    the fact that they have a target tracking period of one trading day, like the
    [Direxion](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Direxion) Daily ETFs, means
    they will probably become very hot in the day trading space. Don’t be surprised
    to see 100 million shares traded in both of these within a few months.
