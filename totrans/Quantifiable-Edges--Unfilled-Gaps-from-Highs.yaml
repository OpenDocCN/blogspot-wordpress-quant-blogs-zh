- en: Wednesday was the first significant day of selling in a while.  The gap down
    in the SPY never filled and the market dropped for most of the day.  Below is
    a study that examines SPY perfromance following other instances of unfilled gaps
    down from a 50-day high.

    few days.  The edge isn't huge, but it appears worthy of consideration.
