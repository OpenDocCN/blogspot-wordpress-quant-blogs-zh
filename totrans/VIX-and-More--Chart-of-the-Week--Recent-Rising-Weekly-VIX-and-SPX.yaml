    I thought it might be a good time for this week’s [chart of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week)
    to build on a tangential subject: the meaning of a simultaneous rise in the VIX
    and the SPX. Lately I have heard more than a few observers comment that the recent
    positive correlation between the VIX and the SPX – specifically the simultaneous
    rise in each index – is a bad omen for stocks.'

- en: Frankly, the [SPX:VIX correlation](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SPX-VIX%20correlation)
    is a subject I have been blogging about since the early days of the blog, with
    some of the more memorable posts on the subject included in the links below. So
    far I have published very little on weekly correlation data for the VIX and the
    SPX, but that is about to change, starting with this post.

    of 2008\. There have been five instances since the beginning of 2008 in which
    both the VIX and SPX have risen in the same week (a relatively low number by historical
    standards largely because a large majority of weeks during this period have seen
    the SPX lose ground.) All five instances have been flagged with a blue arrow on
    the chart.

    inferences, I think it is interesting to note that there were two consecutive
    weeks of gains in both the SPX and the VIX just prior to the sharp drop from September
    through November 2008\. On the other hand, both the SPX and VIX in the middle
    of March, just as the March to July 2009 rally was gathering steam. Finally, the
    early June 2009 blue arrow seems to fall at a relatively uneventful time in recent
    stock market history.
