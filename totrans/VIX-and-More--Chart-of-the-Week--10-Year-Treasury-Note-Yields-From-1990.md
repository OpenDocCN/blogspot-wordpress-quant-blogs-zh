# VIX and More: Chart of the Week: 10-Year Treasury Note Yields From 1990

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/08/chart-of-week-10-year-treasury-note.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/08/chart-of-week-10-year-treasury-note.html#0001-01-01)

The speed with which the yield on the 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note dropped from just over 4.00% in early April to just 2.68% as of Friday’s close is astonishing – and points to how the bond market is evaluating the prospects for deflation, recession and a prolonged economic malaise, or worse.

This week’s [chart of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week) captures the history of the yield on the benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note since 1990, when it was hovering in the vicinity of 9%. For additional context I have also included a gray area chart of the S&P 500 index. More often than not, yields on the long bond are positively correlated with equities, but this relationship can decouple, sometimes for an extended period of time.
