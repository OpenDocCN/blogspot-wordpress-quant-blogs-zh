# Humble Student of the Markets: Timer Model updates

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2011/08/timer-model-updates.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2011/08/timer-model-updates.html#0001-01-01)

A number of regular readers have asked me to update the readings on my

[Asset Inflation-Deflation Timer Model](http://qwestfunds.com/publications/newsletters_pdf/newsletter_november_2009.pdf)

.

There is a new way of regularly accessing those model readings. I have been participating in the

[Ticker Sense blogger sentiment poll](http://tickersense.typepad.com/ticker_sense/2011/08/august-15th-blogger-sentiment-poll.html)

and the my "blogger opinion" is reflective of the model reading, where:

Bullish = Inflation

Neutral = Neutral

Bearish = Deflation

The poll is conducted weekly and the current reading is neutral.
