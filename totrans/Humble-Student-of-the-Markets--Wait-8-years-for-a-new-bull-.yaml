    They found that P/E ratios were correlated to the ratio of middle-aged people
    to young adults, otherwise known as the MY ratio. When MY rises, the market P/E
    will tend to rise and when it falls, P/Es tend to fall.

    fall in P/E ratios with a long-term bottom in stock prices forming about 2018,
    or eight years from now.

- en: Recall that the previous anxious markets paper that I cited indicated that current
    macroeconomic conditions called for volatile markets in the aftermath of the economic
    crisis. This latest paper suggests that we are gripped by a secular bear market
    until 2018\. Putting it all together, the current environment is reminiscent of
    the 1970s, which was gripped by inflationary fears, slow growth, volatile markets
    and flattish equity returns.

    World War, the market has been gripped by two episodes of secular bull markets
    to be followed by secular bears. The secular bulls were characterized by a substantial
    advance lasting over a decade while secular bears were marked by sideways markets
    lasting over a decade.

    policy. The buy-and-hold approach, long espoused by investment advisors during
    bull markets, will result in subpar returns in range-bound periods. Flat markets
    mean flat returns.
