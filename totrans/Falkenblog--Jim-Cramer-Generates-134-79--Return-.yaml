    with returns of 30% to 134.79% (love than .79). It's funny when people sell penis
    enlargement pills online for $50 because its silly and not a lot of money, but
    as John Stewart noted, the stock market isn't a game. This is disgraceful and
    CNBC should be aware this makes them part of his scam. It simply isn't plausible
    that 30%+ returns are representative, and they know that, and suredly would say
    they didn't mean every return is this high, but it's like lottery ads saying 'anyone
    can win'—true enough, but highly misleading.

    theory, ALL stock recommendations promise above average returns. In theory, half
    of all stocks should be recommended with below-average returns because they have
    good 'risk adjusted' returns, but this doesn't happen. That this never happens
    highlights a profound mischaracterization of risk-taking by standard asset pricing
    theory. People only take risk to outperform, never to achieve a lower return with
    greater safety (excluding cash-like asset holdings, such as AAA bonds or short
    term paper).

    it is more profitable to sell advice than invest on it. If he had anything like
    the edge he claims (5% out performance?), it simply makes no sense to sell this
    advice as opposed to invest on it, especially when you have capital to start.
