    in the area of New York City called TriBeCa. In the old days, Franklin Street
    had many spacious lofts ... which got me thinking back to the days where a lot
    of young software companies worked out of lofts or apartments. In fact, in 1986,
    I worked for a young startup called Multex. There were 3 or 4 of us sitting in
    an apartment on West 53rd Street, coding apps for Goldman Sachs. Multex went on
    to expand, go public, and get bought out by Reuters.

    with another former Multex guy (Michael St. Hippolyte) and a developer from Bankers
    Trust. They worked out of Brett's apartment in the 20's, taking Brett's Windows-based
    3270 emulator that he developed for First Boston and selling it to Eicon.

    were people who joined Multex after the Reuters merger. They had no idea that
    they were being interviewed by Multex employee number 5.
