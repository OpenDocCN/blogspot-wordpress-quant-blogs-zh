- en: They are located on the 4th floor of a building on Franklin Street, which is
    in the area of New York City called TriBeCa. In the old days, Franklin Street
    had many spacious lofts ... which got me thinking back to the days where a lot
    of young software companies worked out of lofts or apartments. In fact, in 1986,
    I worked for a young startup called Multex. There were 3 or 4 of us sitting in
    an apartment on West 53rd Street, coding apps for Goldman Sachs. Multex went on
    to expand, go public, and get bought out by Reuters.

  zh: 他们位于Franklin街一座大楼的四楼，这里位于纽约市的TriBeCa区。在从前，Franklin街有许多宽敞的阁楼……这让我想起了许多年轻软件公司曾在阁楼或公寓里工作的日子。事实上，在1986年，我为一家名为Multex的初创公司工作。我们三四个人在西53街的一间公寓里为高盛编写应用程序。Multex后来扩大规模，上市，并被路透社收购。
- en: Former Multex employee Brett Schlussman left just after me, and formed NetLogic
    with another former Multex guy (Michael St. Hippolyte) and a developer from Bankers
    Trust. They worked out of Brett's apartment in the 20's, taking Brett's Windows-based
    3270 emulator that he developed for First Boston and selling it to Eicon.

  zh: 前Multex员工Brett Schlussman在我之后不久离开了，并与另一位前Multex员工（Michael St. Hippolyte）以及来自Bankers
    Trust的开发者一起成立了NetLogic。他们的工作地点在Brett位于20街的公寓里，那里离我曾工作的地方不远。他们把Brett为First Boston开发的基于Windows的3270仿真器卖给了Eicon。
- en: We have interviewed a number of ex-Multex employees recently at Finetix. These
    were people who joined Multex after the Reuters merger. They had no idea that
    they were being interviewed by Multex employee number 5.
