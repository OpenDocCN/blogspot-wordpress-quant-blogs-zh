- en: 'We would like to hire a true .NET/Winforms/C# expert (must be Winforms, not
    ASP.NET). A substantial part of the job would be to take over the .NET Client-side
    framework that Equities is using (ie: the thing I developed). You must be proficient
    in real-time front-ends, multithreading, understanding of messaging systems like
    Tibco EMS, etc.'

    west of New York City. However, you would have substantial opportunities to work
    with the business, which is located both in New York City and in Jersey City,
    NJ.

    for an indie consultant.

- en: This is an on-site job. So, please don't send me resumes from the Ukraine, asking
    if you can work remotely. Also, no calls from recruiters and consulting companies
    for now. I want to pick from people who are truly interested in financial services
    and .NET ... and these people probably read this blog already.

- en: Since the position is in the Equities Advanced Architecture group, you must
    be a really strong communicator. If I ask you to get up to a whiteboard and explain
    something, I should be able to understand you without straining.
