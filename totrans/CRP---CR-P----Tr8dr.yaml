- en: Procrastinating on a hard problem, I decided to take a brief diversion to look
    at Constant Rebalanced Portfolios and Universal Portfolios, lured by Max Dama’s
    [post](http://www.maxdama.com/2009/12/universal-portfolio-thesis.html) on UP (Universal
    Portfolios).   I had read papers on these in the past but never explored them
    empirically.

- en: CRP is the underpinning of Universal Portfolios, so will focus on CRPs.   Simply
    stated the CRP approach allocates a fixed % of capital to each asset in the portfolio.
      The portfolio is rebalanced each period as some assets will have disproportionally
    increased or decreased in value.   As Max points out, this is basically a mean-reversion
    scheme.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unfortunately, this is a “blind” mean-reversion scheme in the sense that there
    is no measure of the likelihood of mean-reversion or the period over which it
    will take place.   The implicit assumption is that mean-reversion will occur between
    rebalancing periods.    The more worrying aspect is that money in “winning” assets
    will be diverted to “losing” assets (where by losing, refer to assets that trend
    downward with little MR in the upward direction).

- en: '**Examples** The classic (and absurd) example where CRP does phenomenally well,
    is of a pair of assets where one asset is constant and the other asset appreciates
    and depreciates on alternating periods (in this case up 25% and down 25% repeatedly).
      Needless to say, this provides exponential growth (I could only plot the first
    100 days without obscuring the other detail):'

- en: '**Empirical Tests** I did not find that CRP did much better than the equivalent
    Buy & Hold portfolio with the same weightings.  Indeed, depending on transaction
    costs, could do significantly worse.     There are some asset sets, undoubtedly,
    that would do much better than Buy & Hold over specific periods, but would be
    few and far between given the fragility of CRP assumptions.'

- en: '**Making the Concept Work** The CRP concept is one of moving money away from
    assets we expect will mean-revert (in the negative direction) and increasing money
    in assets that will mean-revert (in the positive direction).   This is done in
    a rigid fashion and makes no observation as to whether a devaluing asset is likely
    to mean-revert in the next period.'
  prefs: []

- en: It had occurred to me that modifying the rebalancing to take into account the
    likelihood of mean-reversion or more generally, the likelihood of appreciation
    or depreciation in the next period would be a better guide in rebalancing the
    portfolio.    Of course, the performance of such a scheme depends on the degree
    of accuracy of such measures.

    algorithm described by (Borodin, El-Taniv, and Gogan) in “Can We Learn to Beat
    the Best Stock”.    Their approach is to use the autocorrelation and cross-correlation
    of prior periods to adjust the portfolio weighting in a CRP portfolio.

    assets.   That said, they need a way to compare across assets, so may be a reasonable

- en: '**Pattern / Sequence Learning Approaches** There have been a number of papers
    describing approaches where the choice of weightings for the portfolio in the
    next period is determined based on finding prior patterns that match the current
    local pattern in past data.   I.e. the prior K returns are converted to a series
    of symbols and compared to historical sequences.   One attempts to locate the
    approximate sequence one or more more times in past history and observe the optimal
    portfolio weights that maximized cumulative return in the past.    This is repeated
    with varying length and discretization “fuzziness”.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The observed weights are blended based on the performance of the past weightings
    and degree of match with the current sequence.    The authors point to excellent
    results on empirical data.   It is surprising that there is a reasonable amount
    of information in the daily returns, I had thought would be more dominated by
    noise.

    that some weighting of CRP will yield the most optimal portfolio provided returns
    are i.i.d.   There lies the rub.'
