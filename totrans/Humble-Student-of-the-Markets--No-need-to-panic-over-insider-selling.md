# Humble Student of the Markets: No need to panic over insider selling

[Mark Hulbert](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/better-watch-out-insiders-are-selling-2012-12-18)

reported that, according to Vickers, insiders are turning to the sale of equities after turning bullish in late November:

> Corporate insiders are no longer on the side of the bulls.
> This represents a remarkably quick shift from the situation that prevailed just one month ago, when the average insider was behaving quite bullishly. ( Read [my Nov. 21 column, “Insider behavior points to imminent rally.”](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/insider-behavior-points-to-imminent-rally-2012-11-21) )
> 
> After all, the stock market is barely 4% higher today than then. And though a return of that magnitude in one month’s time is nothing to sneeze at, is that really enough of a rise to justify such a big shift in insider behavior? Either something has led them to change their minds about their companies’ longer-term prospects, or they have become short-term traders like the rest of the market.
> 
> It’s probably a little bit of both. Since the government doesn’t gather data on the reasons for insiders’ behavior, we don’t know for sure.

He concluded that:

> But regardless, the picture the data paint is unmistakably bearish.

I beg to differ. There are a couple of one-off reasons that could account for the flurry of insider sales:

1.  They are selling in anticipation of the end of the world, as predicted by the Mayan calendar; or
2.  They are selling in anticipation of higher capital gains taxes in 2013, especially when it appears a fiscal cliff deal is near.

Assuming that the Mayan Apocalypse doesn't happen this Friday (

[here](http://kiddynamitesworld.com/now-accepting-all-mayan-apocalypse-wagers/)

is one way you hedge the end of the world), there is no need to panic just yet. Explanation #2 is a perfectly plausible reason for the rash of insider activity as 2012 draws to a close. In that case, I would wait for the insider activity data in January to see if insiders are indeed selling because of deteriorating corporate fundamentals, or for tax related reasons.
