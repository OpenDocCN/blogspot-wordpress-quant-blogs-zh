- en: to Paul Krugman's criticism of my recent Bloomberg article on limits to growth.
    It's over at Medium.com in the new collection Bull Market. I don't think Krugman's
    arguments carried a lot of weight, as you'll see. First paragraphs below....

- en: exploring some ideas about possible physical (and biological/ecological) limits
    to economic growth. I pointed out that total global energy consumption continues
    to grow even as we learn to use energy ever more efficiently. And I suggested — based
    on empirical data from the recent past — that there’s little reason to believe,
    as many economists quite confidently do, that our energy use will soon “decouple”
    from economic expansion, enabling us to fly off into a future of unlimited betterment
    through increasing economic output, even as we come to use less and less energy.
    I also examined a few reasons why continuing to use ever more energy is a certain
    path to ever worsening ecological problems; it’s really not a wise option.

- en: (to use Noah Smith’s elegant description). He was aggravated that I, as a physicist,
    was weighing in on topics he thinks should be left to economists. He also suggested
    that I was just recycling an old argument originally put forth by other physical
    scientists, which his fellow economist William Nordhaus had completely demolished
    long ago. Now Krugman had to rise up to do it again! How tiring!

- en: But Krugman’s actual argument was surprisingly weak, and I think grossly misleading,
    so here’s an attempt to bring a little more clarity to the discussion. I do think
    Krugman is a brilliant columnist, and I agree with him on lots of things, maybe
    even most things. But he very much has the wrong end of the stick on this one.
