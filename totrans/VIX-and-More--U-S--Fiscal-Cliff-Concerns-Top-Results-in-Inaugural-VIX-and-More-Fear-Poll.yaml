- en: Today I closed the books on the first *[VIX and More Fear Poll](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Fear%20poll)*,
    which I consider to be an unqualified success and a first step in establishing
    longitudinal data about the types of geopolitical, macroeconomic, technical and
    other issues that make investors fearful, anxious and uncertain about the future
    of the stock market.

    cliff](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/fiscal%20cliff) as their #1
    concern right now, followed closely by [fears](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/fear)
    about the [European sovereign debt crisis](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/European%20sovereign%20debt%20crisis),
    which 27.1% labeled as their top issue. The prospect of a weak earnings season
    was a distant third at 13.1%.'

    geographically. In the U.S., for instance, the fiscal cliff issue dominated the
    European sovereign debt crisis, 31.5% to 22.2%, with weak earnings third at 15.4%.
    Looking at non-U.S. responses, the Americentric bias disappears, as 36.6% of respondents
    tab the European sovereign debt crisis as their top worry, followed by the fiscal
    cliff (23.2%) and U.S. elections (9.8%).

    though central bank interventions, U.S. debt, deleveraging, higher interest rates,
    high-frequency trading, demographics and technical factors were among the issues
    cited.

- en: Among some of the questions raised by the results are the role of local and
    national media in shaping investors’ fears and the tendency of investors to overemphasize
    events that are closest to home. These are just two of the issues that I hope
    to explore going forward, making use of some of the data generated by this poll
    over time and comparing the ebb and flow of concerns against the ebb and flow
    of the VIX.

    with the results and some takeaways to be published at about the same time every
    week.
