- en: So I completed a model and calibration which determines the probability of a
    price going through a level within a given time period. If one can arrive at a
    high confidence level, this is incredibly useful for multi-leg execution and as
    a prop strategy in its own right.

- en: The model uses a SDE with mean reversion, a trend component, and an evolving
    distribution to determine the price across time. The SDE is evaluated as a monte
    carlo simulation on a grid. We determine the conditional probability of going
    from one price level to the next for a given (small) time interval. The sum of
    the product of the probabilities along the price path represents the posterior
    probability of being at the given price node at a given time.

    a price being above or below a level within a given time, etc. For some markets,
    we are seeing a 75% confidence level, meaning we are right 3/4 of the time. There
    were some markets where there was no distinct edge in the approach, I have ideas
    on how to adjust this, but have not had the time to revisit.

- en: The evolution of the distribution was the most complex to model. Unlike idealized
    option models, where the distribution is stationary and generally gaussian, the
    observed intra-day distribution over short periods is neither gaussian nor stationary.
    We noted that the first 3 or 4 moments have dynamics which can be modelled and
    fitted on top of an empirical distribution.

- en: The trending and mean reversion functions were fitted using a maximum likelihood
    estimate, which was easily obtained from the distribution for each time step under
    given assumptions. The parameters were evolved with a GA to maximize the likelihood.
