- en: The table below is from a study I showed in last night’s subscriber letter.
     It shows how SPY has performed every year, during the last 15 minutes of trading

- en: On average SPY has lost 0.25% in the last 15 minutes of trading.  And if you
    just look at the losers, the average loss was 0.345%.  Last year was the 1 big
    up year (excitement over avoiding the Fiscal Cliff?).  If you are a daytrader
    with a long position, this might be a good day to close up shop 15 minutes early…
