    taking large majorities in both houses of Congress. Their mandate was to work
    with the President to fix America’s economic problem. So, Obama’s and Congressional
    Democrats’ first priority is to end the recession as quickly as possible. I guarantee
    you there would be hell to pay if this is not done well before November 2010 when
    the next general election is held.

    industry as these were the two economic issues front and centre in the election
    which he said he could tackle. With the banking industry stabilised, the Obama
    legacy rides crucially on how the Auto Bailout proceeds. Under no circumstances
    is the Obama Administration going to allow General Motors to do to the economy
    in 2009 what Lehman Brothers did to it in 2008\. They are going to fix GM no matter
    what it takes. And if this includes heavy-handed tactics, so be it.

    bears down on America and you’re out of office in due course. The key policy decision
    is how to ensure a favourable outcome. And when I say favourable, I mean one that
    ensures as many jobs as possible while minimizing any wider economic fallout.
    Other issues like treating bondholders well, not committing taxpayer monies to
    the effort, or keeping government out of the auto industry are going to be much
    less important.'

    which has huge importance in the Rhineland, Germany’s industrial heartland and
    part of the most populous German state North Rhine-Westphalia, as well as in Lower
    Saxony, Bavaria, and Baden-Württemberg. In short, destroying auto jobs is a sure-fire
    way to lose an election. The ruling coalition is keenly aware of this and that
    is why they too will be very involved in the GM bankruptcy as it affects Germany
    through GM subsidiary Opel…
