- en: It will take several days before there is sufficient data to draw a meaningful
    comparison between the VIX and [VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX),
    the new [VIX ETN](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20ETN). For
    better or for worse, that will not prevent me from commenting on how VXX looks
    coming out of the starting blocks.

- en: My first observation is on the volume. With 143,600 shares being traded in the
    first three hours since VXX was launched, it looks as if this product is going
    to be a hit with investors. Not only is the volume high, but it has been reasonably
    steady too, with a few spikes along the way.

- en: In terms of how closely VXX tracks the VIX, the one minute chart below (top)
    from BigCharts provides the first graphical depiction of the relationship between
    the two. On average, VXX (black line) has been a little less volatile than the
    VIX (gold line), but there have been periods when the VXX has moved more decisively
    than the VIX.

- en: I have added a five minute chart (bottom) to smooth out some of the noise inherent
    in a one minute chart. The trends and relative movements are easier for the eye
    to digest in this chart and demonstrate that VXX has been significantly less volatile
    than the VIX in the first three hours of today’s session.

- en: Absent any statistical analysis (coming next week), I would say that so far
    as today’s data indicates, VXX is an excellent though slightly sluggish ([as expected](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/05/vix-futures-one-picture-to-remember.html))
    proxy for the VIX. All things considered, it is already the best trading vehicle
    for approximating the cash/spot VIX that has been brought to market.
