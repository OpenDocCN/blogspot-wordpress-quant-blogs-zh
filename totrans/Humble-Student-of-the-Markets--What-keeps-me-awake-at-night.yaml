    after World War II, when many experts thought the U.S. was sure to fall into another
    depression, his father, Jay, accurately predicted a rapid expansion instead. In
    late 1999, his uncle, Leon Levy, a hedge fund manager and collector of antiquities,
    invited this reporter into his office, pointed to a bust of a rich Roman near
    his door and mused on the fleeting nature of fortune. He then predicted a new

    rates to their lowest levels ever to stimulate the economy. That's exactly what

    Exports contributed 14 percent of U.S. economic output last year, up from 9 percent
    in 2002\. That sounds like a good development, but it also makes the country more
    dependent on global growth, which, in turn, relies more on emerging markets. Those
    markets accounted for 50 percent of global output last year, up from 38 percent
    in 2002.

    to $63 billion during July. We think this is a one-month aberration. However,
    it may be that lending to residential property builders has hit a brick wall as
    a glut of housing units is depressing prices. In any event, on a y/y basis, bank

    up just 2% in nominal terms. Private consumption plunged 18.7% during Q2\. It’s
    not obvious why it wasn’t obvious to the government that mixing massive monetary
    and fiscal stimulus with a major tax hike was akin to stepping on the accelerator
    and the brakes at the same time. It’s a sure way to wind up in a ditch. Even capital
    spending fell 12.3%. Despite the weaker yen, exports fell 1.8%. It’s dismal.

    Perhaps the biggest shock last week was that Germany’s real GDP fell 0.6% (saar)

    winter weather. However, weakness in the rest of the Eurozone is weighing on the

    has been a slow-motion train wreck so far.
