    as of this writing, to the low 95s, losing roughly 12% of its value during the
    previous two weeks. BA is still a solid company with good management, strong earnings,
    and good outlook. So, what could come of a 12-15% correction? Put simply, a wealth
    of opportunity.

    here would be to go long BA while simultaneously going short LMT, expecting the
    two to converge once again, or at the very least, continue in their trend up,
    with the gains from going long BA outweighing the losses from going short LMT.

    should begin to level out this week, while LMT moves lower or sideways. Friday
    saw BA open at 96.11 and close at 96.69, the first substantial increase in 8 days.
    Today will see a close lower, but in a range smaller than Friday's.
