    speculating, and investing. Gambling is investing without an edge, such as when
    one plays the lottery, or invests in stock without alpha. Investing is what Warren
    Buffet does.

- en: The annual per capita lottery expenditure in the US is about $150, and the rate
    of return is about -47% per dollar played. These investments clearly cater to
    what is commonly called those seeking risk, or positive skew, in particular. A
    study of the popularity (sales) of lotteries found that average payout (expected
    return) did not matter, but the size of the top prize was highly significant in
    motivating popularity. In other words, the $100 million super lotto has a lot
    of sales even though the probability of winning is so small it basically is outside
    the realm of intuition (1 in 150 million). A St.Louis Fed

    Such bad decision making is probably not orthogonal to their poverty status. Investing
    in lottery tickets, however packaged, is a great way to stay poor.
