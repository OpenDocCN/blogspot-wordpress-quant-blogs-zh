    its recent streak. Perhaps this may signal a change in character from the downtrend
    since the October highs. Traders may not be looking to leave the party every time
    there’s a pause in the conversation.'

    The range over the last 3 days has been the tightest of any three days since December.
    Even more interesting to me is that over the last 13 days, the high-low range
    the S&P 500 has traveled has barely exceeded the range it traveled in the one
    day prior to that. The SPY on January 23rd had a range of $7.35\. Since then the
    total range has been $7.88.

    traded in a range nearly as tight relative to one bar over a 13-day span. The
    parameter I used was that the range of the last 13 days had to be within 115%
    of the range of the 14th day back. I found 31 other occurrences going back 30
    years. Twenty-five of those occurrences saw the market higher a month later. Only
    three times that I found was the range contraction followed by a break to the
    downside which led to significantly more selling. Those occurrences were August
    1985, September 1990 and August 1998.

    the next several weeks risk/reward appears to favor the upside. Even this contracted
    range has some serious volatility, though, so risk should not be underestimated.
    Good timing and proper (reduced) position sizing appear key.
