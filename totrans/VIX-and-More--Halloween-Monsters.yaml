    as elaborate as the [Guillermo del Toro couch intro](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtgYY7dhTyE)
    for the 2013 Treehouse of Horrors episode of The Simpsons (definitely worth a
    click through) I have elected instead to construct a portfolio of what I am calling
    the [Halloween Monsters](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Halloween%20Monsters)
    – a group of ten stocks that have been absolutely killing it this year, leading
    the markets higher.

    because this behemoth now has a $346 billion market capitalization and there are
    some limits on how quickly on organization this size can grow.

- en: With the inclusion of Baidu, the list reminded me a little of something I did
    back in October 2007, when I sensed a little too much froth in the stock market
    and created something I called the [OHFdex](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/OHFdex),
    which began as a “watch list of Overripe High Fliers” and quickly evolved into
    an index designed to track 14 such stocks. When the markets turned down, the group
    was pummeled, with some [spectacular crashes](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/10/ohfdex-one-year-later.html)
    from the likes of CROCS ([CROX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/CROX)),
    Las Vegas Sands ([LVS](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/LVS)), DryShips
    ([DRYS](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/DRY)) and others.

- en: The current list is certainly filled with high fliers, but whether they are
    overripe or capable of soaring higher is not as obvious as it was in October 2007
    – at least for me. For that reason, I will keep a close eye on the Halloween Monsters
    portfolio going forward, as their movements will likely be a tip off as to where
    the broader markets are headed.

    fodder for the archives, just as the OHFdex did in 2007 and 2008\. Who knows,
    perhaps the next iteration of the OHFdex is just around the corner.
