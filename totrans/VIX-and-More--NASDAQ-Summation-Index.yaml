    [McClellan Summation Index](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/McClellan%20Summation%20Index),
    which I have discussed in this space [several times](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/McClellan%20Summation%20Index)
    in the past year.  While the McClellan Summation Index draws upon NYSE advance
    decline data, I am actually a little bit partial to the NASDAQ variant.  For those
    who use StockCharts.com, the ticker for the NASDAQ summation index is [NASI](http://stockcharts.com/charts/indices/McSumNASD.html)
    and the NYSE/McClellan version is the [NYSI](http://stockcharts.com/charts/indices/McSumNYSE.html).

    a buying opportunity or a warning sign?'

    NASI data going back ten years.  It clearly shows that buying on any significant
    NASI dip (say -900 or lower) since the October 2002 bottom has been an excellent
    investment tactic, as was the run up to the 2000 market top.  The graph also shows,
    however, that during the 2000-2002 bear market, this was a risky strategy that
    tried to capture short bounces which were brief countertrends against a falling
    tide.  It was possible to be successful, but tight stops and/or a narrow time
    horizon were needed to control risk.

- en: When all is said and done, we are back to a discussion about whether it makes
    sense to buy on the dips.  In a well defined uptrend, there is not doubt that
    this is a winning strategy.  In a bear market, one can still make money on the
    bullish countertrend, but these need to be surgical strikes.  There isn’t much
    in the way of sideways action evident in this long-term chart, but it is safe
    to conclude that buying on the dips in a non-trending market – classic oscillator-based
    trading – is less profitable than trading with the trend, but offers more substantially
    opportunity than trying to trade against it.

- en: My current reading of the NASI is that we are more likely than not to get a
    bounce off of current levels; if it turns out we are in a bear market, these gains
    will be short-lived, but if we are putting in a bottom of at least intermediate-term
    length, there is considerable opportunity to the upside.
