# Humble Student of the Markets: The hidden story of investor capitulation

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2022/11/the-hidden-story-of-investor.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2022/11/the-hidden-story-of-investor.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models** 

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post, 

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The 

**Trend Asset Allocation Model**

 is an asset allocation model that applies trend-following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity prices. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. The performance and full details of a model portfolio based on the out-of-sample signals of the Trend Model can be found

[here](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/trend-model-report-card/)

.

My inner trader uses a 

**trading model**

, which is a blend of price momentum (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa). Subscribers receive real-time alerts of model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of the email alerts is updated weekly

. The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that began in March 2016 is shown below.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Sell equities*
*   Trend Model signal: Neutral*
*   Trading model: Bullish*

** The performance chart and model readings have been delayed by a week out of respect to our paying subscribers.***Update schedule**

: I generally update model readings on my

 on weekends and tweet mid-week observations at @humblestudent. Subscribers receive real-time alerts of trading model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of those email alerts is shown

**Resilient retail sentiment?**

AAII conducts two surveys, and they are different from each other. The weekly AAII survey asks respondents how they feel about the markets. The monthly survey asks them what they're doing with their money. The latest monthly asset allocation survey shows that while equity weights have fallen, they are nowhere near the capitulation levels seen at the bottom of the 1990, 2003, and 2008 bear markets. It has led to the conclusion that retail investors haven't thrown in the towel, which opens the door to further downside potential in stock prices.

I beg to differ...
