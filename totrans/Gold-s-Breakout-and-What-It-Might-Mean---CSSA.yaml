    what is going on. Gold tends to follow three major correlation paths: 1) As a
    leading indicator of potential credit or currency events or 2) an inflation play
    when it moves in tandem with oil 3) as sort of an inverse play on the US dollar—when
    the dollar tanks, gold rises and vice versa. For the last few months, gold moved
    up along with other commodities and inverse the falling dollar. This indicated
    both prospect for future inflation and for further currency weakness. Right now
    we are seeing the US dollar hold in a tight range near its lows, oil and other
    commodities start to weaken, while gold is making a major breakout. The divergence
    implies that the force behind the gold breakout is something other than simply
    inflation expectations or fear of a weakening dollar. My bias is that this divergence indicates
    either 1) the known existence of something burning on the credit front that we
    are currently not aware of OR 2)  simply the  fear or expectation of some sort
    of bank failure or credit event. Only time will tell which of these two scenarios
    gold is reflecting. A final possible, but less likely scenario is that gold is
    forecasting a serious breakdown in the US dollar–an event that I would discount
    given that the lead/lag relationship between the two is generally very tight and
    appears to occur almost concurrently.'
