    and the emerging markets. The market was focused on the possibility of a European
    banking crisis during much of 2011\. No, the bear case for stocks in 2012 does
    not rest with Europe. I believe that market's focus will shift from Europe to
    the other regions of the world in 2012.

    years, has virtually eliminated the possibility of a banking failure. In addition,
    coordinated central bank intervention that offered unlimited USD liquidity also
    showed that central bankers around the world are well aware of the risks of a
    Lehman/Creditanstalt credit event and have taken steps to address the problem.
    Nevertheless, problems remain and all Draghi & Company has done is bought time
    for the politicians to address the long term issues.

    responds to news. In the past couple of weeks, we saw a couple of important signs
    that much of the good news is priced into stocks. The first occasion occurred
    when the market sold off in the aftermath of a better than expected LTRO at €489
    billion. The second was when it sold off again when Italy sold six-month bills
    at yields that were roughly half of what they were in November.
