    of excessive debt were to be lifted (and hopefully coupled with some form of stimulus

    oriented. Its underlying philosophy calls for getting the right market mechanisms
    in place, e.g. cost structures, labor market reforms, the right incentives, etc.,
    and growth will naturally follow. The problem with this approach is that Greece,
    unlike countries like Ireland, has few competitive advantages. The EU mandated
    solution amounts to forced internal devaluation. It would mean that, in the example
    of textiles, that Greek wages would have to fall even further to levels that competes
    with the likes of China, Vietnam or Thailand.

    the modern state, is in Greece’s case unfinished, and in some respects even un-started,

    often lacked the capacity to implement reforms properly or, in some cases, at
    all. In Syriza’s case, the problem of lack of capacity has been accentuated by
    lack of willingness. This year, both sides argued a lot about debt relief, primary
    surpluses, VAT rates and pension arrangements. But many of their disputes were
    bridged or narrowed significantly. What irks Europe most about Syriza is the latter’s
    inaction with regard to initiatives to overhaul governance. In other words, to
    improve the capacity to implement reforms by addressing dysfunctional institutions
    such as administrative capacity, a weak tax system, over-regulation and protection,
    corruption and the rule of law, and the privileges of oligarchies, professional

    sector. The PASOK government (1981-89), for example, is argued to have created
    dysfunctional public administration, civil service and wage-setting institutions
