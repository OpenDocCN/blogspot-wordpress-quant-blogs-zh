    and NR4 bars to look for explosive moves.

- en: 'The market’s steep selloff on Friday created a WR7 bar.  On Monday the selling
    quieted and the market actually put in an NR7 day.  While volatility tends to
    be mean reverting, it’s unusual to see it contract that fast.  I look at the action
    in the NDX back to 1986 when a WR7 with a lower close was followed by an NR7 the
    next day.  Buying on the close of the NR7 day and holding for “X” days achieved
    the following results:'

- en: It appears the inability of the sellers to follow-through after the wide range
    day down invites buying over the next several days. In the very-short term (1-3
    days) the bias is strongly bullish.  Consider the fact that the average day over
    the period tested was a 0.06% gain.  The one day performance following this setup
    was over 10-times a normal day and over three days it outperformed and average
    three days by over 5-times.  The high win rate and average win size consistently
    higher than the average loss make this setup intriguing.

    impact on performance and was not differentiated in the results above.  2) A WR7
    up bar is a less bullish setup – but I’ll look at that in more detail when the
    time is appropriate.'
