## Culture and Ethos

Interesting read on the i-Vista blog around company [culture](http://www.ivistasolutions.com/blog/a_culture_that_works_creating_a_company_ethos_that_spells_success/).  Values (point 2) are in my view extremely important, tied to a vision.  With no clear vision and no consistent values, how can a company expect to move down the road.

The Neel Whitten Group provides a number of interesting [articles](http://nealwhittengroup.com/articles/) that are worth a read, and then a reflection on what you do in your day job 😉 – Three snaps of the [fingers](http://nealwhittengroup.com/articles/three-snaps-of-the-fingers/) being one example.
