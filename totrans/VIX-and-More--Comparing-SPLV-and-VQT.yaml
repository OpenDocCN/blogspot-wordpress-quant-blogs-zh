    New Risk Control ETFs from Direxion](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2012/01/three-new-risk-control-etfs-from.html),
    there appears to be a significant portion of the investment community that is
    uncertain about just how some ETPs are attempting to dampen volatility and control
    risk.

    had a smaller peak to trough drawdown during the August-October selloff, and dramatically
    outperformed SPY during the period covered by the chart. Once VSPY establishes
    some meaningful historical data, I will return to this subject and offer a more
    detailed comparison of all three approaches to controlling risk.
