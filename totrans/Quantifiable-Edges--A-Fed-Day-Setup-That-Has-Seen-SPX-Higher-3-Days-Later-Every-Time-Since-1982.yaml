- en: Tuesday’s decline was the 3rd down day in a row.  Many people are now aware
    that Fed Days have historically had a bullish tilt.  So 3-day selloffs leading
    up to Fed Days have been quite rare.  But they have also been a very bullish setup.
     The table below shows the hypothetical results of buying at the close on the
    day before a Fed Day if it was at least the 3rd consecutive lower close.  The
    exit is 3 days later.

- en: All of the 15 instances saw the market higher 3 days later.  These are some
    very encouraging numbers for the bulls.  I do have a concern here.  There has
    only been 1 instance in nearly 15 years.  And that took place in 2005\.  The setup
    has certainly been potent over a long period of time.  But I am much less enthused
    about it than I would be if all these instances would have taken place over the
    last 10 years.  Still, with an undefeated record I think it is worth consideration.
