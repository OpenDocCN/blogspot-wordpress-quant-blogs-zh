## Team Productivity

As I read [Project to Product](https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/projects-products-what-it-means-why-it-matters) by Mik Kersten, I’m reminded of the need for teams to remain **durable** and **responsible** as part of their [journey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckman%27s_stages_of_group_development):

> Giving work to an existing high-performing team will get you results much faster than having to form a team first, then dissolve that team at the end.

The alarm in the above quote is “dissolve”. Team are so often dissolved before they [perform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckman%27s_stages_of_group_development). In my career, organisations seem to rarely discuss the impact of mobility/terminations on the team, possibly causing a cycle of forming/storing which can make it to performing. Scaling of people to aid a project, is often considered in terms of adding budget to increase headcount, forgetting about the need to consider product over project. The counter to this is that headcount doesn’t guarantee an increase in velocity. Brining us nearly to [flow and value stream](https://blog.tasktop.com/what-flows-through-a-software-value-stream/).

As [DORA](https://speakerdeck.com/helenjbeal/using-dora-metrics-to-accelerate-value-stream-flow?slide=8) and [SPACE](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3454124) offer a [measure](https://www.alldaydevops.com/blog/using-devops-principles-to-measure-value-flow) of engineering [productivity](https://www.infoq.com/news/2021/03/space-developer-productivity/), we need to pause and consider the customer experience of [productivity](https://digitalanarchist.com/videos/2020-webinars/learn-from-the-experts-using-dora-metrics-to-accelerate-value-stream-flow) rather than just the engineering, thereby offer insight into what [business value you’re delivering, and how quickly](https://blog.tasktop.com/moving-from-project-to-product-with-flow-metrics-what-are-they-and-why-should-you-care/). [Flow](https://blog.tasktop.com/what-flows-through-a-software-value-stream/) of value.

This leads us to the need for organisation change to allow team to become effective, which in itself is a considerable challenge, since we are probably all aware of the ivory towers that exist. [McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/the-five-trademarks-of-agile-organizations) offer some insight into the [journey](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/the-journey-to-an-agile-organization)
