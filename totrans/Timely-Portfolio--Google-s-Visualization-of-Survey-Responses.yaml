- en: As I try to develop the most beautiful and informative visualization of the
    survey responses [Survey Time](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2012/01/survey-time.html),
    I thought I should have a base case on which I could improve.  Fortunately, Google
    offers a visualization, which I think is actually pretty good.  Thanks to everyone
    who has responded.  Please respond (takes less than 1 minute) if you have not
    yet.
