- en: There are several excellent sources which will provide the latest updates on
    [hurricanes](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/hurricanes) and the various
    potential paths that a number of computer models are projecting.  These sites
    include the [National Hurricane Center](http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/index.shtml),
    [Weather Underground](http://www.wunderground.com/tropical/?index_region=at),
    [AccuWeather](http://hurricane.accuweather.com/hurricane/index.asp?), and others.  The
    most common graphical depiction of these projections come in the form of a [probability
    cone](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/08/hurricanes-and-vix.html) that projects
    the most likely path of the eye, with an increasingly large cone farther into
    the future to reflect the increased uncertainty about the forecast.

    adjust your portfolio accordingly.  There is another tool that I don’t believe
    many know is out there.  [Intrade](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Intrade),
    the [prediction market](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/prediction%20markets)
    site, has recently added a number of contracts covering possible landfall locations
    for [Gustav](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Gustav).  The graphic
    below highlights the current landfall contracts associated with Gustav.  These
    range across the Gulf of Mexico and also include Georgia, South Carolina, and
    “any other state”.  Note that all these contracts stipulate that landfall has
    to be as a [category 2 hurricane](http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutsshs.shtml) (winds
    96-110 mph) or higher.  Finally, there is also a contract that Gustav does not
    make first landfall in the U.S. as a category 2 or higher hurricane.

    interesting data sources as volume picks up in these contracts, enhancing the
    value of their informational content.
