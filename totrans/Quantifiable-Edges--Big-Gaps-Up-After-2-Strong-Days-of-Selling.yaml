- en: After 2 hard days of selling the SPY looks to be gapping up strong this morning.
     I looked back at other times that the SPY gapped up big after 2 large down days.
     Below are the results since 2003 of buying all instances at the open and then
    selling at the close.

- en: There appears to be a bit of an inclination to follow through on the gap to
    the upside.  Most of the instances were quite volatile, and all of them pulled
    back at least 0.4% below the open at some point during the day.  Most of them
    also took place during 2008 when volatility (both intraday and overnight) was
    elevated.
