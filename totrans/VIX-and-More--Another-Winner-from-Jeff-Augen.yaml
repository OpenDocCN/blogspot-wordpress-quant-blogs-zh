    Edge in Options Trading: New Technical Strategies for Investing in Unstable Markets](http://www.amazon.com/Volatility-Edge-Options-Trading-Strategies/dp/0132354691/ref=tag_tdp_sv_edpp_i)
    a Best New Volatility Book award in the [*VIX and More* 2008 Volatility Awards](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/01/2008-volatility-awards.html).
    I thought that book did an excellent job in providing new insights in how to trade
    the earnings cycle and the [options expiration](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/options%20expiration)
    cycle.'

    Expiration: Strategies and Models for Winning the Endgame](http://www.amazon.com/Trading-Options-Expiration-Strategies-Winning/dp/0135058724/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1242150975&sr=1-1)
    and once again had a very favorable reaction. This time around Augen focuses almost
    entirely on the last two days of the options expiration cycle and offers up some
    interesting ideas and trading strategies to take advantage of anomalies in time
    decay and [implied volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/implied%20volatility).'

    of the book’s strengths.

- en: If you are like me, you probably find the last two days of the options expiration
    cycle to be among the most difficult periods to trade. After reading Trading Options
    at Expiration, I *guarantee* (and how many guarantees are there in the investing
    world?) that you will look at the end of options expiration week differently and
    see more opportunities than pitfalls.

    as good a time as any to start evaluating some new strategic approaches.
