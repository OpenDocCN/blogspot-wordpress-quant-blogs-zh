    and twice that ''off balance sheet'', meaning their guarantees. If they had a
    50% chance of surviving, which seemed reasonable, because even the worst C rated
    companies default at 20% levels. And a viable Fannie is worth $40B at least. But
    they did fail, so it was a bad pick, but I did say to buy financials in general.
    I was wrong on that company, but I stand by the logic, and the rule.'

    clear these indices are correct, that is, a bottom up calculation of mortgage
    portfolios would be helpful. It appears that mortgages were really bad for those
    issued between late 2005 and mid 2007\. The question is, how much are these worth,
    as a percentage of par, and what percentage of mortgage portfolios containt theses
    vintages. That's an empirical question, and we have a good estimate of their loss
    curves, which were really bad for 2006, and twice as bad for 2007 (really really
    bad).

    lowers housing prices because it keeps unowned properties in limbo longer, and
    an unowned property is a cancer to its community. This is like the depression
    policies that turned a downturn into a depression. Hopefully, these efforts will
    be rebuffed, but if not, it will be a classic case of good intentions leading
    to a worse outcome.
