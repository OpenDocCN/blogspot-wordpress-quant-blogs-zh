- en: Former UBS banker Bradley Birkenfeld won $104m for exposing the giant Swiss
    bank’s efforts—illegal in America but not in its home country—to help American
    taxpayers hide money in offshore accounts. I think the take-away is that any organization
    involved in large-scale illegalities should realize that the incentive to turn
    over insider evidence is huge now, and this should dissuade law-breaking of this
    scale, which is a good thing. However, a huge organization will necessarily have
    many gray areas because bidding is strategic, and so could always be seen as conspiratorial
    by some, or have disparate impact. Thus, this probably massively increases the
    amount of bureaucracy that already weakens these companies.

    while serving as tax counsel to the Senate Finance Committee, and with other lawyers
    will share in an estimated 10-33% of the reward—says he has two dozen other cases
    pending, two of them bigger than Mr Birkenfeld’s. His phone has rung incessantly
    since the settlement.
