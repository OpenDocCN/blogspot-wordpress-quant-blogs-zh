    so many because we are constantly using heuristics to explain and predict, and
    of course these heuristics are often applied incorrectly, in the same way we think
    people from large countries or states far away know each other or get along (eg,
    I remember when I got to college, and being from Cleveland someone said to me,
    ''Do you know Joe down the hall? He''s from Cincinnati.'').  Simple errors, good
    to rectify. As there are as many different patterns we try to project on little
    information in life, it''s understandable we have so many biases.'

    pages, so the author did an admirable job boiling down these big thinkers into

    have one big drive, rather, many.'
