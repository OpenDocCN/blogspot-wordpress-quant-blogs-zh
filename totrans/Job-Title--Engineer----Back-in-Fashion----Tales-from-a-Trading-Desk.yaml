    rather than concentrating on doing stuff well during their career.  Historically
    it feels like the “engineering” title has over the last time period, been a bit
    of a dirty word.  Reading Matt Welsh’s [posting](http://matt-welsh.blogspot.co.uk/2013/04/running-software-team-at-google.html)
    on “Running a software team at Google” and listening to a few low latency pod
    casts, made me wonder if “engineer” was the new best job title?
