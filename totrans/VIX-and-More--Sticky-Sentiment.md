# VIX and More: Sticky Sentiment

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/04/sticky-sentiment.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/04/sticky-sentiment.html#0001-01-01)

![](img/d4567c35a35ace3cd167f68691a77410.png)Back in February I received a lot of positive feedback for a post titled [Intrade Prediction Markets as a Sentiment Indicator](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/02/intrade-prediction-markets-as-sentiment.html) which discussed the usefulness of [prediction markets](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/prediction%20markets) as a gauge of investor sentiment.  This is a theme I will come back to in due course, but for now I wanted to highlight some excellent complementary work in this area.

Expanding on prediction markets as sentiment indicator theme and drawing an interesting parallel in the sports world, Jeff Miller at [A Dash of Insight](http://oldprof.typepad.com/) has a superb post up today in which he looks at the ebb and flow of the <state st="on">North Carolina</state> vs. <state st="on"><place st="on">Kansas</place></state> game as a case study in investor sentiment.  In [Sentiment Is Slow to Change: A Basketball Lesson, Part One](http://oldprof.typepad.com/a_dash_of_insight/2008/04/senitment-is-sl.html), Jeff uses a real-time chart of the price of the futures contract for the game from Intrade’s sister site, [TradeSports.com](http://tradesports.com/) and provides a thought-provoking analysis of the changing fortunes during the game and the betting response in the futures contract.  I highly recommend that readers click over for the [full story](http://oldprof.typepad.com/a_dash_of_insight/2008/04/senitment-is-sl.html), but I have taken the liberty of posting Jeff's conclusion below:

*“The lesson here is that market sentiment is very ‘sticky.’ Those investing in UNC futures were not just fans. Most were regular players of many sporting events, seeking a profit on this one. They began with an opinion, and the opinion was slow to shift.*

*The value of looking at an example like this is that the entire picture of sentiment and reality can be captured in the space of a few hours.*

*In the stock market, a similar process may take many months or even years. We shall explore this further.”*

I am certainly looking forward to the next installment in this series.
