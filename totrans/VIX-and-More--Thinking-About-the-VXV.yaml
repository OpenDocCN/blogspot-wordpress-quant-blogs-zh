    which I [first mentioned](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/11/catching-up-on-reader-mail.html)
    just after the CBOE [launched](http://www.cboe.com/AboutCBOE/ShowDocument.aspx?DIR=ACNews&FILE=cboe_20071112.doc&CreateDate=12.11.2007)
    the product in mid-November.

    days out, the VXV measures IV for options 3 months (93 days) out.  For those who
    want to get into the details of the VXV, the best source is a 6 page [“Index Description”
    PDF](http://www.cboe.com/micro/vxv/3monthvix.pdf) published by the CBOE.  In this
    paper, I found the following comments to be of particular interest:'

- en: '*“VXV has tended to be less volatile than 1-month VIX. Since January 2002,
    the volatility of VXV daily returns has been 58.4% compared to 90.1% for VIX.
    The correlation between VXV and 1-month VIX during that time was 0.92, indicating
    a strong tendency to move together, but far from moving in lockstep.*'

    of SPX option implied volatility. The following chart shows VXV price movement
    along with a measure of the difference between the 3-month VXV and 1-month VIX.
    Since January 2002, VXV has been higher than VIX – reflecting an upward sloping
    term structure – 79% of the time. However, 21% of the time, especially when volatility
    spikes, VIX is greater than VXV – reflecting a downward sloping term structure.”*'

    VXV was higher than 1-month VIX by more than 10%, the average closing VIX level
    over the following 20 trading days was, on average, higher by at least 5%. Moreover,
    this effect became more pronounced as the slope of the term structure steepened.  Conversely,
    when the slope of the VXV / VIX term structure was relatively flat (less than
    5%) or downward sloping (VXV lower than VIX), VIX levels over the next month tended
    to be lower, on average.”*'
