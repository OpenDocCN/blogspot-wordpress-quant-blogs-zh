- en: A number of web sites have postings on [Gazelle](http://osnews.com/story/21120/Microsoft_s_Next_Browser_To_Be_Based_on_Gazelle_),
    Microsoft [Research‚Äôs](http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=79655)
    multi-principle OS web [browser](http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/79655/gazelle.pdf).
    It remains to be seen how this research project will influence future Microsoft
    browser technology, but given the quality of work coming from MSR these days,
    it can only benefit all Window users in the long run.

- en: The [SDS](http://blogs.msdn.com/ssds/archive/2009/03/10/9469228.aspx) announcement
    this week means that CloudTrader can now fully support an SDP trade database in
    the cloud. [Cloud](http://blogs.msdn.com/rxg/archive/2009/03/09/azure-multi-tenant-addressing.aspx)
    development just got a lot more exciting üôÇ The only downside to SDS is that I
    suspect some organisations are still going to have an issue with putting data
    into the cloud due to legal requirements about country etc. We also still need
    COMET functionality within Azure üòâ to stand any chance of producing decent [line
    of business applications](http://blogs.msdn.com/rxg/archive/2009/03/09/azure-multi-tenant-addressing.aspx)
    ‚Äì maybe Kaazing or similar should consider this?

    announce the roadmap for the combined CEP engines the better!](http://www.finextra.com/fullstory.asp?id=19746)
