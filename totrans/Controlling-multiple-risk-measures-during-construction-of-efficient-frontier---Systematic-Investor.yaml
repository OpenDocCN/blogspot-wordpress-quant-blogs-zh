    and [Expected shortfall (CVaR) and Conditional Drawdown at Risk (CDaR)](https://systematicinvestor.wordpress.com/2011/10/25/expected-shortfall-cvar-and-conditional-drawdown-at-risk-cdar-risk-measures/)
    risk measures. These risk measures can be formulated as linear constraints and
    thus can be combined with each other to control multiple risk measures during
    construction of efficient frontier.

- en: The new efficient frontier, labeled ‘Risk+MaxLoss’, is located between ‘Risk’
    and ‘MaxLoss’ efficient frontiers in both Risk, measure by Standard Deviation,
    and Maximum Loss plots. The main difference between original ‘Risk’ and new ‘Risk+MaxLoss’
    portfolios can be seen for their Transition Maps. To control Maximum Loss during
    mean-variance optimization, the ‘Risk+MaxLoss’ portfolios do not have allocation
    to Emerging Markets (EEM – highlighted with green).
