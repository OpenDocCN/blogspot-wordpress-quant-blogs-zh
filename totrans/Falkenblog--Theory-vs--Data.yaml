    on his readings of Sherlock Holmes (see

    a puzzle that would daunt your average person. Freud then though if he could supply
    a dynamic explanation for virturally every reported dream or error, the soundness
    of his method would be demonstrated, so Freud's case studies read a lot like a
    fun mystery novel. It turned out detective stories are a bad template for creating
    a new science because it is all

- en: Our narrative brain theorizes and is often wrong, but of course it does the
    best it can. Interestingly, the left side, the language side, is the theorizer.
    Thus, if you show the left brain a sequence of lights that flash above the line
    80% of the time, rats and pigeons and 4-year olds do better than adults because
    our left, theorizing side, tries to guess which one will be above or below the
    line, matching only the relative frequency, but wasting many choices below the
    line. We basically become dominated by our wacky, theorizing left side around
    age 5, which as any parent will tell you, is well before reasoning has been perfected.

    as Michael Gazzaniga has done with his studies of split-brain patients, the right
    side is a simple bayesian, and goes with the frequentists approach (see his book

    the other half a theorist trying to integrate, analyze, and generalize.

    that old cliche, moderation in all things. Look at the data too. If they contradict
    your theory, or cannot be really contradicted by data, alter your theory. The
    problem seemed to be that Freud was always the smartest kid in the room growing
    up, so he probably thought he could simply make up anything at all, because he
    could argue for or against anything with complete confidence he would win as he
    always did. Unfortunately he learned fake thinking, the kind salesmen, lawyers
    and politicians are especially good at, which is reasoning and arguing without
    a prioritization of the truth. For him the truth was merely a tactical constraint,
    a concession in small facts, never for the big one.
