- en: Dice can be loaded—that is, one can easily alter a die so that the probabilities
    of landing on the six sides are dramatically unequal. However, it is not possible
    to bias a coin ﬂip—that is, one cannot, for example, weight a coin so that it
    is substantially more likely to land “heads” than “tails” when ﬂipped and caught
    in the hand in the usual manner. Coin tosses can be biased only if the coin is
    allowed to bounce or be spun rather than simply ﬂipped in the air
