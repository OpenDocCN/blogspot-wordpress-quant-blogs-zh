- en: I’ve updated the Quantifiable Edges Big Time Swing System overview page with
    results through July 2nd when the most recent trade closed out. There is not a
    trade currently open. Since the system only averages about 1 trade per month,
    I typically update the results bi-annually. The 1st half of 2012 produced a net
    return of 2.6% for SPY (including dividends, commissions of $0.01/share, and an
    assumed interest rate on cash of 0.1%).  This was achieved with 1 short trade
    and 4 long trades.  Four of the five trades made money.

- en: For those looking for a system that they can use as a base to build their own
    system from, the Big Time Swing is an attractive option. It is all open-coded
    and comes complete with a substantial amount of background historical research.
    And since it is only in the market about ¼ of the time, it can easily be combined
    with other systems to provide greater efficiency of capital. Once you’re ready
    to try and improve the system yourself you can also refer to the system manual
    or the August 2010 purchaser-only webinar – both of which discuss numerous ideas
    for customization.

- en: And if system development isn’t your thing, the Big Time Swing System provides
    easy to follow mechanical rules that you can follow. The standard parameters have
    performed quite well. There are only about 11 trades per year averaging 7 trading
    days per trade. All entries and exits are either at the open or the close. And
    to be sure you have everything set up properly traders may follow the private-purchasers
    only blog that shows all SPY signals and possible entry/exit levels. This service
    is free for 12 months from the date of purchase.
