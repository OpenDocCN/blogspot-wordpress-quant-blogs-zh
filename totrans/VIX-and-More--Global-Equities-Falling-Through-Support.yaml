    up a chart of the South Korean [KOSPI](http://stockcharts.com/charts/gallery.html?%24KOSPI)
    if you really want to see an ugly market.

    Index](http://www2.standardandpoors.com/portal/site/sp/en/us/page.topic/indices_gbl100/2,3,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0.html)
    ETF ([IOO](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=ioo)), which is comprised of 100
    large cap (average $10 billion) multinational companies that are selected based
    on the firm’s percentage of foreign assets, revenues, and employees.  For more
    details, check out the [S&P 100 holdings](http://www2.standardandpoors.com/portal/site/sp/en/us/page.topic/indices_gbl100/2,3,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,3,0,0,0,0,0.html).

    picture has accelerated dramatically this week, with stocks falling through technical
    support and bringing the IOO back to levels not seen since July 2006.  If IOO
    cannot hold the 2006 support level of 61.00, then another even uglier leg down
    is certainly a distinct possibility.
