- en: at some point in the following few days. There are currently 2 upside gaps of
    2% or more that have yet to close below the opening gap price. They are the 10/28
    and the 10/30 gaps. It appears unlikely that the 10/28 level of $87.34 will be
    threatened in the next day or so. Should the 10/30 opening gap also hold that
    could be viewed as a significant sign of strength for this early attempt at a
    rally.

- en: Amazingly, the system has not triggered since 9/26/08\. Therefore, the 48% profits
    generated were all achieved prior to the big October selloff. The system is also
    in an 18-trade winning streak, dating back to April.

  zh: 令人惊讶的是，自2008年9月26日以来，该系统从未被触发过。因此，产生的48%利润都是在10月份的大幅下跌之前实现的。自4月份以来，该系统已经连续18笔交易盈利。
- en: The market is reaching short-term overbought conditions that over the last year
    and a half have led to at least short-term pullbacks. Whether it is able to rally
    in the face of such conditions or whether it pulls back sharply in the next few
    days could be a telling sign of strength or weakness, and whether a character
    change could be in order.

  zh: 市场正达到短期超买状态，过去一年半时间里，这种状态至少导致了短期回调。市场是否能在这种状态下反弹，或者是否在接下来的几天内大幅回调，可能是衡量其强度或弱点的一个显著标志，也可能是需要改变策略的一个转折点。
