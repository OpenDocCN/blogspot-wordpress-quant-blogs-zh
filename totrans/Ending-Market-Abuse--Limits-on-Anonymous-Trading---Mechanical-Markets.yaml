    on enhancing the structure of US equities markets has seen a variety of proposals
    to make our markets better. Given the open atmosphere to new ideas, some of which
    have been quite radical, it may be appropriate to consider one more: changing
    the current paradigm of complete anonymity in trading. Market participants want

- en: One way to expose undesirable trading activity would be for the SEC (or FINRA/exchanges)
    to make public de-anonymized order data long after the fact (say, 90 or 180 days).
    That way, even if the SEC is too overworked to investigate all imaginable types
    of market manipulation, other traders could. There would definitely be motivated
    people studying the data in order to learn about markets. And, given the SEC [bounty](https://www.sec.gov/whistleblower)
    for manipulation and fraud, there’s a sizable incentive to search for and report
    suspicious trading. One of the chief complaints about HFT is that it engages in
    legal but unethical behavior. For those traders within the letter of the law who
    would still be embarrassed by their trading, the prospect of public shame could
    be a useful deterrent.

  zh: 揭示不良交易活动的一种方法是由SEC（或FINRA/交易所）在事后（例如，90或180天后）公开去匿名化的订单数据。这样，即使SEC过于忙碌而无法调查所有可能类型的市场操纵，其他交易者也可以。肯定会有积极的人研究数据以了解市场情况。鉴于SEC对操纵和欺诈的奖励，寻找并报告可疑交易是有可观激励的。对于HFT的主要抱怨之一是其从事合法但不道德的行为。对于法律上合规但仍然会因其交易而感到尴尬的那些交易者来说，公开羞辱的前景可能是一种有用的威慑手段。

    pose a challenge, I think it may be readily achievable. The current [MIDAS](http://www.sec.gov/marketstructure/midas.html)
    system looks like it provides a complete and precise view of the market. Exchanges
    (I believe) keep track of the MPID (Market Participant ID) associated with every
    order ID, which could be integrated with MIDAS to provide Broker-Dealer level
    identification of the entire market. Once the [Consolidated Audit Trail](http://www.finra.org/Industry/Issues/cat/)
    is complete this task would be even easier, could include hidden orders, as well
    as identify traders at a more granular level like [Large Trader ID](http://www.sifma.org/issues/operations-and-technology/large-trader-reporting/overview/).

- en: This proposal clearly accommodates traders with reasons 1\. and 2., as well
    as the most important swath of traders with reason 3\. The substantial delay before
    the data is published should provide ample time for a position target to be realized.
    And certainly counterparties couldn’t use the stale information to avoid trading
    with the savviest participants. High-frequency traders afraid that their secret-sauce
    could be uncovered with analysis may have more cause for concern. Some algorithms
    would be immediately visible even by eye, but I’d argue that these would tend
    to be more latency-oriented strategies. Such strategies may as well be publicly
    known anyhow, since the main advantage their proprietors have are not the actual
    strategies, but their speed. Whether or not this data were public, if a competitor
    were faster than them, then they probably wouldn’t be successful. Strategies that
    police complex market relationships or interpret disparate data sources would
    be much harder to reconstruct, but in some cases it could still be possible. One
    of the principle arguments behind algorithmic trading is that it aids price discovery
    beyond the ultra-short-term. If an algorithm is truly making longer-term price
    predictions, then it would be very hard to decipher from de-anonymized data. If
    it isn’t, then maybe it deserves to belong to the fastest traders in the market.
    I’ll also mention that trading strategies need constant tuning; dissemination
    of information that’s 6 months out of date is probably not too significant a threat
    to operators of complex strategies.

  zh: 这一提案显然可以满足具有1\.和2\.理由的交易者，以及具有3\.理由的最重要的一部分交易者。数据发布前的大幅延迟应该提供充足的时间来实现头寸目标。当然，交易对手不能利用过时信息来避免与最精明的参与者交易。高频交易者担心他们的秘密酱料可能会被分析揭示可能更有理由担忧。一些算法甚至可以被肉眼立即看到，但我认为这些算法往往是更关注延迟的策略。无论这些数据是否公开，如果竞争对手比他们更快，那么他们可能不会成功。监管复杂市场关系或解释不同数据来源的策略将更难重构，但在某些情况下，这仍然可能是可能的。算法交易背后的一个主要论点是它有助于超出超短期的价格发现。如果算法真的在做更长期的价格预测，那么从去匿名化的数据中解读将非常困难。如果不是，那么也许它应该属于市场上最快的交易者。我还要提到，交易策略需要不断调整；传播已过时6个月的信息对于操作复杂策略的人来说可能并不是太大的威胁。
- en: HFTs usually have the most bare-bones interaction possible with the public.
    I think that’s partly out of fear that their algorithms will be discovered but
    also stems from a more mundane aversion to the public eye. This proposal would
    significantly reduce their privacy. There are arguments on both sides about whether
    this privacy is reasonable. Without getting into them, I will point out that large
    investment managers already have to [report](http://www.sec.gov/answers/form13f.htm)
    their long positions and that in some countries detailed financial information
    must be made public [[1](#bottom)]. For instance, in the Netherlands annual financial
    statements are [public](http://www.kvk.nl/english/trade-register/trade-register-products/annual-financial-statements/)
    for all large companies and, in the UK, employee compensation is public for certain
    financial [institutions](http://www.fca.org.uk/firms/being-regulated/remuneration-codes).
    These countries are obviously not finding the publicity to be an obstacle to retaining
    trading talent (plenty of HFTs are in both, e.g. [Optiver](http://www.optiver.com/corporate/our-business/news-press/optiver-net-profit-increases)
    or [Jump](http://news.efinancialcareers.com/uk-en/169289/high-frequency-trading-firm-nearly-triples-pay-925k-head/)).
    Nasdaq Nordic until [recently](http://globenewswire.com/news-release/2014/02/06/608114/0/en/IT-INET-Changes-to-post-trade-counterparty-visibility-in-NASDAQ-OMX-Nordic-blue-chip-shares-and-improved-transparency-in-trading-statistics-11-14.html)

    ([p.21](http://www.nasdaqomx.com/digitalAssets/97/97000_nasdaq-omx-nordic-market-model-2015_02.pdf)).

  zh: HFT（高频交易）通常与公众的互动极其有限。我认为这部分是因为他们担心自己的算法会被发现，但也源于对公众关注的一种更加普通的厌恶。这项提议将显著降低他们的隐私。关于这种隐私是否合理，双方都有争论。不想深入讨论这些争论，我要指出的是，大型投资管理公司已经不得不[报告](http://www.sec.gov/answers/form13f.htm)他们的多头持仓，在一些国家，必须公开详细的财务信息[[1](#bottom)]。例如，在荷兰，所有大公司的年度财务报表都是[公开的](http://www.kvk.nl/english/trade-register/trade-register-products/annual-financial-statements/)，而在英国，某些金融[机构](http://www.fca.org.uk/firms/being-regulated/remuneration-codes)的员工报酬是公开的。显然，这些国家并没有将公开信息视为留住交易人才的障碍（这两个国家都有很多HFT，例如[Optiver](http://www.optiver.com/corporate/our-business/news-press/optiver-net-profit-increases)或[Jump](http://news.efinancialcareers.com/uk-en/169289/high-frequency-trading-firm-nearly-triples-pay-925k-head/)）。纳斯达克北欧直到[最近](http://globenewswire.com/news-release/2014/02/06/608114/0/en/IT-INET-Changes-to-post-trade-counterparty-visibility-in-NASDAQ-OMX-Nordic-blue-chip-shares-and-improved-transparency-in-trading-statistics-11-14.html)要求全面披露交易对手，并且对许多证券仍然如此（[第21页](http://www.nasdaqomx.com/digitalAssets/97/97000_nasdaq-omx-nordic-market-model-2015_02.pdf)）。因此，如果我们在美国看到与隐秘行动的转变，我预计结果会非常好。
- en: Because it is relinquishing significant privacy, I’d expect there to be resistance
    to this proposal. But there are significant gains to be had for HFTs as well.
    Conspiracy theorists paranoid about HFT are becoming increasingly influential.
    In order to be taken seriously, they would need to back up their claims with real
    data and show not just isolated examples of market weirdness, but systematic patterns
    of abuse. And, because this proposal would make abuse so easily discoverable,
    there would be much less of an impetus for more radical reforms that would put

- en: '[[1](#1)] One potential issue with this proposal would be that big short-sellers
    might find themselves in more danger of getting squeezed. Large long positions
    already must be [disclosed](http://www.sec.gov/answers/sched13.htm), but to my
    knowledge currently big short sellers *could* keep their position secret. If something
    like the above rule were put in place, that would change. By seeing a trader’s
    executions, it wouldn’t be hard to estimate their position (although it’d be out
    of date). It’s true that overall short interest is already [public](http://www.nasdaqtrader.com/trader.aspx?id=Shortinterest),
    so this change wouldn’t be monumental. But if Hedge Fund A accounts for 90% of
    a stock’s short interest, then Hedge Fund B could start buying up shares until
    Fund A runs out of cash and is forced to liquidate at a massive loss. Fund B could
    probably even cause a short squeeze just by going on TV and announcing that they
    might do this sort of thing. Leaving aside whether Hedge Fund A deserves secrecy
    in this case, you could probably avoid these shenanigans by having a sufficiently
    long delay before the data is public. I don’t know if 90 days would suffice, but
    1 year seems like it ought to. [Amsterdam Trader](http://amsterdamtrader.com)

    of [Europe](http://www.fca.org.uk/your-fca/short-positions-daily-update)) large
    shorts are public the very next day. And European markets function just fine with
    information like this, which is possibly recent enough to reveal a large short-seller
