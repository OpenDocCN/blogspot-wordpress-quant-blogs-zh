    major problem today: inequality. This seems like altruism, but focusing on the
    top 1% is also consistent with envy. Many think the top 1% are responsible for
    the poverty of the 99%, especially the truly poor, those in the bottom quartile.
    Yet the poor are pretty far removed from anything the top 1% can do. Graduate
    from high school, get married before you have children, work at any kind of job,
    even one that starts out paying the minimum wage.'

    tests on willpower. He notes it is a finite resource, and so quitting smoking
    is much harder when you are also studying (the rigorous study of common sense!).
    But willpower is like a muscle in that it weakens while you use it, but also strengthens
    the more you use it, so practicing it daily by doing things like standing up straight
    and not swearing transfers to other areas. Making decisions is exhausting, it
    depletes one's willpower, so its useful to design simple rules for much of your
    daily toil. Being low on energy from lack of sleep or nutrition also hurts your
    willpower. Basically, practice daily acts of self-control to become more productive.

    that long-term memory, unlike short-term memory, involved the synthesis of new
    proteins. You get long-term memories through repetition in the same way you build
    muscle through exercise, so if you practice something daily and it becomes a habit--the
    muscle memory of a golf swing, the neural memory of saying ''please'' and ''thank
    you''--you actually have altered your brain. Your habits are not just abstract
