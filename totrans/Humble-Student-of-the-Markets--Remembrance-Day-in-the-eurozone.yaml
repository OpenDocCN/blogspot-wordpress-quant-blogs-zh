- en: Our story begins at the close of World War II. As that war drew to a close in
    1945, the leaders of Western Europe came together and surveyed the wreckage. For
    centuries Europe had been racked by conflict, centered mainly between France and
    Germany. As an example of the level of carnage, consider that the French and Germans
    lost over 800,000 men (dead, wounded, missing and captured) in one single battle
    – the multi-year

    Economic Community (EEC), also known as the Common Market, was formed. The intent
    was not purely trade liberalization, but to bind Germany to Europe so tightly
    that major European conflicts could never happen again. The EEC later became the
    European Union (EU). Further economic integration occurred in December 1995 when
    many EU countries adopted the euro as a common currency.

    the Germans were to mobilize the Bundeswehr today and announced to the troops
    that they were going to war with France, the men would all laugh and go home.
