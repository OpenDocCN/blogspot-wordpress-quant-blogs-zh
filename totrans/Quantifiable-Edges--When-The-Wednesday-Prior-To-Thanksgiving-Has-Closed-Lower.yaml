- en: It appears the market is going to buck historical tendencies today and close
    down.  This will be the 11th time since 1960 that the SPX has closed lower on
    the Wednesday before Thanksgiving.  Below I have listed the other 10 instances
    along with the SPX performance on Friday (the day after Thanksgiving).

    Wednesday before Thanksgiving down over 1%.

- en: For what it's worth I would note that statistics associated with these 10 instances
    (win %, profit factor, avg. gain, etc) are pretty much in line with all Fridays
    after Thanksgiving.  (It has generally been bullish.)
