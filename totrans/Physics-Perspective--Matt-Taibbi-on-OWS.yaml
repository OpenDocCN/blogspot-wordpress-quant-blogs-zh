    Lloyd Blankfein and Jamie Dimon get billions of dollars for free, from the Federal
    Reserve. They borrow at zero and lend the same money back to the government at
    two or three percent, a valuable public service otherwise known as "standing in
    the middle and taking a gigantic cut when the government decides to lend money
    to itself."'

    or credit cards at twenty or twenty-five percent. This is essentially an official
    government license to be rich, handed out at the expense of prudent ordinary citizens,
    who now no longer receive much interest on their CDs or other saved income. It
    is virtually impossible to not make money in banking when you have unlimited access
    to free money, especially when the government keeps buying its own cash back from
    you at market rates.

    all the more incredible that most of the too-big-to-fail banks are nonetheless
    still functionally insolvent, and dependent upon bailouts and phony accounting
    to stay above water. Where do the protesters go to sign up for their interest-free
    billion-dollar loans?

    forbid, a mortgage payment, you can forget about the great computer in the sky
    ever overlooking your mistake. But serial financial fuckups like Citigroup and
    Bank of America overextended themselves by the hundreds of billions and pumped
    trillions of dollars of deadly leverage into the system -- and got rewarded with
    things like the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program, an FDIC plan that allowed
    irresponsible banks to borrow against the government''s credit rating.'

    apartments and gets rewarded by having Daddy co-sign his next lease. The banks
    needed programs like TLGP because without them, the market rightly would have
    started charging more to lend to these idiots. Apparently, though, we can’t trust
    the free market when it comes to Bank of America, Goldman, Sachs, Citigroup, etc.

    government, so investors know it's relatively safe to lend to them -- which means
    it's now cheaper for them to borrow money than it is for, say, a responsible regional
    bank that didn't jack its debt-to-equity levels above 35-1 before the crash and
    didn't dabble in toxic mortgages. In other words, the TBTF banks got *better credit*
    for being *less responsible*. Click on [freecreditscore.com](http://freecreditscore.com/)

    we shouldn''t feel sorry for people who''ve been foreclosed upon, because it''s
    they''re own fault for borrowing more than they can pay back, buying more house
    than they can afford, etc. And critics of OWS have assailed protesters for complaining
    about things like foreclosure by claiming these folks want “something for nothing.”'

    “something for nothing is Wall Street’s official policy." In fact, getting bailed
    out for bad investment decisions has been *de rigeur* on Wall Street not just
    since 2008, but for decades.

    up in their faces, they've scored bailouts. It doesn't matter whether it was the
    Mexican currency bailout of 1994 (when the state bailed out speculators who gambled
    on the peso) or the IMF/World Bank bailout of Russia in 1998 (a bailout of speculators
    in the "emerging markets") or the Long-Term Capital Management Bailout of the
    same year (in which the rescue of investors in a harebrained hedge-fund trading
    scheme was deemed a matter of international urgency by the Federal Reserve), Wall
    Street has long grown accustomed to getting bailed out for its mistakes.

    Banks placed billions in bets with AIG and should have lost their shirts when
    the firm went under -- AIG went under, after all, in large part *because* of all
    the huge mortgage bets the banks laid with the firm -- but instead got the state
    to pony up $180 billion or so to rescue the banks from their own bad decisions.
