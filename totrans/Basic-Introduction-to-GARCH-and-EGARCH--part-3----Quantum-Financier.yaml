    I will briefly talk about one of the many variant of the GARCH model: the exponential
    GARCH (abbreviated EGARCH). I chose this variant because it improves the GARCH
    model and better model some market mechanics.'

    kept them for today’s post. First of all, the GARCH model assume that only the
    magnitude of unanticipated excess returns determines ![\sigma^2_t](img/21fd744994e2f41e326d17da24f7f33a.png).
    Intuitively, we can question this assumption; I, for one, would argue that not
    only the magnitude but also the direction of the returns affects volatility. In
    plain English: negative shocks (events/news, etc.) tend to impact volatility more
    than positive shocks. Think about the asymmetric nature of the VIX (see [Bill
    Luby’s Vix and More](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/)).'

    of volatility shock. How long does a shock linger in the volatility estimate?
    Some may persist for a finite period of time while other might linger *ad vidam,
    aeternam*; effectively changing the market volatility structure. In the GARCH
    (1,1) model, shocks can be persistent or not, which might be undesirable depending
    on the situation.

    due to how the EGARCH counteracts the limitations on the classic GARCH model.
    In terms of implementation, as always, I recommend using statistical software
    to perform the analysis.

    followed other academic papers, and I took some part textual, trying to only focus
    on what I thought was important for an introduction. Please refer to them if you
    want more information.
