    CBOE Volatility Index, the VIX calculates market expectations of 30 day implied
    volatility for S&P 500 index options. The VIX (sometimes referred to as the cash
    or spot VIX) is a statistic that the CBOE calculates and disseminates every 15
    seconds during the trading day. While widely disseminated, this statistic is not
    available for purchase.

    A long VIX position is very similar to a long SPX [straddle](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/straddle)
    (or [strangle](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/strangle)); a short
    VIX position is very similar to a short SPX straddle (or strangle.)
