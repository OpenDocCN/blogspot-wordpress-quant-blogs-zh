    section is “significance”. It is a statistical term that most readers are likely
    familiar with but many perhaps do not fully understand. Rather than try and explain
    it myself, below I have pasted an excerpt from the late Arthur Merrill’s August
    1986 newsletter. It was passed along to me from a colleague a while back. I found
    it to be clear, concise, and a much better explanation than I could possibly write:'

    95% confidence that the result isn’t just luck. This level has been called “probably
    significant.”

    Use (a) for the smaller of the two and (b) for the larger. Look for (a) in the
    left hand column of the table below. If (b) exceeds the corresponding number in
    the 5% column, the difference from 50/50 is “probably significant”; the odds of
    it happening by chance are one in twenty. If (b) exceeds the number in the 1%
    column, the difference can be considered “significant”; the odds are one in a
    hundred. If (b) exceeds the numbers in the 0.2% (one in five hundred) or 0.1%

    number must be used for (a) and (b), not the percentages.
