    to regulate the banking industry, derivatives in particular. This afternoon, quite
    by coincidence, I noticed on a colleagues' disordered desk a copy of

    of the Bank of England. It's message should be a matter of urgent public debate
    in the US, and elsewhere. Yet I haven't heard Haldane's arguments mentioned anywhere
    in the US media.

    with bankers, in part due to the proliferation of instruments which have made
    it possible for banks to spread risks far and wide and make profits events as
    they amplify system wide risks. The banking industry is also a polluter:'

    air pollution, policy makers, guided by economists, worked out ways to solve the
    problem through regulations and, where necessary, outright prohibitions of some
    practices. That's where we are now with the banks. The regulations under consideration
    recognize the social costs of systemic risk and try sensibly to find a redress.
    The bankers response has of course been to whine and scream.

- en: The first practical step in addressing a pollution problem is to estimate how
    much pollution there is. How much do we pay to guarantee bank solvency during
    these not-too-infrequent systemic crises? Haldane points out that if you count
    only the monetary amount transferred to banks by governments, the cost of the
    recent crisis is fairly large -- about $100 billion in the US. But this is probably
    an extreme lower bound to the true collective cost. As Haldane remarks,

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '"...these direct fiscal costs are almost certainly an underestimate of the
    damage to the wider economy which has resulted from the crisis – the true social
    costs of crisis. World output in 2009 is expected to have been around 6.5% lower
    than its counterfactual path in the absence of crisis. In the UK, the equivalent
    output loss is around 10%. In money terms, that translates into output losses
    of $4 trillion [for the US] and £140 billion [for the UK] respectively."'

    measure of human well being, or even of the narrow economic well being of a nation
    (in particular, it tells us nothing at all about how much of the store of natural
    resources may have been eaten up in achieving that GDP). However, the scale alone
    in this case suggests that the cost of the crisis -- and other crises, which seem
    to strike more and more frequently with modern financial engineering and its global
    reach -- are immensely high.

    anything you're likely to see in the popular media (especially in the US).

    only the fault of the recklessly loaning banks. So, how much of the systemic costs
    associated with financial crises really is due to the banks? One place to look,
    Haldane suggests, is the valuations given to banks by the ratings agencies, many
    of which take explicit note of the fact that governments give a subsidy to banks
    in the form of implicit or explicit safegaurds to their stability. Some give banks
    two different ratings, one "with government support" and one "without." Haldane
    goes through a simple calculation based on these ratings, and estimates the effective
    subsidy to many big banks is on the scale of billions. The data suggests it has
    been increasing for the past 50 years. The "too big to fail" problem shows up
    in the data as well -- the average ratings difference for large banks is much
    bigger than it is for small banks. As Haldane sums up:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For the sample of global banks, the average annual subsidy for the top five
    banks was just less than $60 billion per year...  the large banks account for
    over 90% of the total implied subsidy. On these metrics, the too-big-to-fail problem
    results in a real and on-going cost to the taxpayer and a real and on-going windfall
    for the banks."

- en: Haldane's speech -- as far as I'm aware -- is unique among high-level banking
    figures in taking seriously the public costs entailed by banking practices. Imagine
    where the US might be today if we'd taken that $60 billion per year and, over
    the past decade, invested it in infastructure, education and scientific research.

- en: In the rest of his speech, Haldane explores what might be done to end or control
    this pollution, through taxes or by making some banking practices illegal. This
    too is illuminating, although what emerges is the view that finding a solution
    itself isn't so hard. What is hard is gathering the political will to take steps
    in the face of banking opposition. Publicizing how much they pollute, and how
    much we pay to let them do it, is perhaps a first step.
