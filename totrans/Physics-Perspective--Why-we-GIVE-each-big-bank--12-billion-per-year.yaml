- en: '"Exhaust fumes are a noxious by-product. Motoring benefits those producing
    and consuming car travel services – the private benefits of motoring. But it also
    endangers innocent bystanders within the wider community – the social costs of
    exhaust pollution."'

    with bankers, in part due to the proliferation of instruments which have made
    it possible for banks to spread risks far and wide and make profits events as
    they amplify system wide risks. The banking industry is also a polluter:'

  zh: 然后，他继续提出观点，我们现在面临的局面与银行家在很大程度上相同，部分原因是工具的扩散使银行能够广泛传播风险并从中获利，同时放大系统风险。银行业也是一个污染者：
- en: '"Systemic risk is a noxious by-product. Banking benefits those producing and
    consuming financial services – the private benefits for bank employees, depositors,
    borrowers and investors. But it also risks endangering innocent bystanders within
    the wider economy – the social costs to the general public from banking crises."'

- en: What is to be done about polluters? Back in the 1970s, in the face of the rising
    air pollution, policy makers, guided by economists, worked out ways to solve the
    problem through regulations and, where necessary, outright prohibitions of some
    practices. That's where we are now with the banks. The regulations under consideration
    recognize the social costs of systemic risk and try sensibly to find a redress.
    The bankers response has of course been to whine and scream.

  zh: 应该如何对待污染者呢？回到1970年代，面对上升的空气污染，政策制定者们在经济学家的指导下，找出了通过法规和必要的某些实践的明令禁止来解决问题的方法。现在我们对待银行就是这样的。正在考虑的法规认识到系统风险的社会成本，并试图合理地找到一种补偿。银行家的反应当然是不停地抱怨和尖叫。
- en: The first practical step in addressing a pollution problem is to estimate how
    much pollution there is. How much do we pay to guarantee bank solvency during
    these not-too-infrequent systemic crises? Haldane points out that if you count
    only the monetary amount transferred to banks by governments, the cost of the
    recent crisis is fairly large -- about $100 billion in the US. But this is probably
    an extreme lower bound to the true collective cost. As Haldane remarks,

  zh: 解决污染问题的第一个实际步骤是估计污染的程度。我们为在这些问题上保证银行清偿能力支付了多少钱？霍尔丹指出，如果你只计算政府向银行转移的货币金额，最近危机的成本相当大——大约为美国1000亿美元。但这可能远远低于真正的集体成本。正如霍尔丹所评论的，
- en: '"...these direct fiscal costs are almost certainly an underestimate of the
    damage to the wider economy which has resulted from the crisis – the true social
    costs of crisis. World output in 2009 is expected to have been around 6.5% lower
    than its counterfactual path in the absence of crisis. In the UK, the equivalent
    output loss is around 10%. In money terms, that translates into output losses
    of $4 trillion [for the US] and £140 billion [for the UK] respectively."'

  zh: 这些直接的财政成本几乎肯定低估了危机给更广泛的经济带来的损害——危机的真实社会成本。预计2009年全球产出比没有危机的情况低大约6.5%。在英国，相应的产出损失大约是10%。用货币来衡量，这分别意味着美国和中国分别损失了4万亿美元和1400亿英镑。
- en: Now, I'm not one to take GDP loss arguments too seriously. It's not a very good
    measure of human well being, or even of the narrow economic well being of a nation
    (in particular, it tells us nothing at all about how much of the store of natural
    resources may have been eaten up in achieving that GDP). However, the scale alone
    in this case suggests that the cost of the crisis -- and other crises, which seem
    to strike more and more frequently with modern financial engineering and its global
    reach -- are immensely high.

  zh: 现在，我不是那种特别认真对待GDP损失论的人。GDP不是一个很好的衡量人类福祉的指标，甚至也不是一个国家（特别是）经济福祉的狭义指标（尤其是它根本不告诉我们关于自然资源消耗了多少来实现那个GDP）。然而，在这种情况下，危机的成本——以及其他越来越频繁地与现代金融工程及其全球影响力相结合的危机——成本是巨大的。

  zh: 但这里正是霍尔丹的观点变得非常有趣的地方——而且超出了你在流行媒体（特别是在美国）中可能看到的内容。
- en: 'Lots of people recklessly borrowed in the run up to the crisis; it wasn''t
    only the fault of the recklessly loaning banks. So, how much of the systemic costs
    associated with financial crises really is due to the banks? One place to look,
    Haldane suggests, is the valuations given to banks by the ratings agencies, many
    of which take explicit note of the fact that governments give a subsidy to banks
    in the form of implicit or explicit safegaurds to their stability. Some give banks
    two different ratings, one "with government support" and one "without." Haldane
    goes through a simple calculation based on these ratings, and estimates the effective
    subsidy to many big banks is on the scale of billions. The data suggests it has
    been increasing for the past 50 years. The "too big to fail" problem shows up
    in the data as well -- the average ratings difference for large banks is much
    bigger than it is for small banks. As Haldane sums up:'

  zh: 在危机爆发前，很多人鲁莽地借款；不负责任的放贷银行并非唯一的过错方。那么，与金融危相关联的系统成本中有多少真的应归咎于银行？霍尔丹建议，一个可以查找的地方是评级机构对银行的估值，其中许多机构明确注意到政府以隐性或显性的保障来支持银行的稳定性。一些机构给银行两种不同的评级，一种是“有政府支持”，另一种是“没有”。霍尔丹通过这些评级进行了一次简单的计算，估计许多大银行的有效补贴规模达数十亿美元。数据显示，这一数字在过去50年中一直在增加。“大而不倒”的问题在数据中也有所体现——大型银行的平均评级差异远大于小型银行。霍尔丹总结说：
- en: For the sample of global banks, the average annual subsidy for the top five
    banks was just less than $60 billion per year...  the large banks account for
    over 90% of the total implied subsidy. On these metrics, the too-big-to-fail problem
    results in a real and on-going cost to the taxpayer and a real and on-going windfall
    for the banks."

- en: Haldane's speech -- as far as I'm aware -- is unique among high-level banking
    figures in taking seriously the public costs entailed by banking practices. Imagine
    where the US might be today if we'd taken that $60 billion per year and, over
    the past decade, invested it in infastructure, education and scientific research.

- en: In the rest of his speech, Haldane explores what might be done to end or control
    this pollution, through taxes or by making some banking practices illegal. This
    too is illuminating, although what emerges is the view that finding a solution
    itself isn't so hard. What is hard is gathering the political will to take steps
    in the face of banking opposition. Publicizing how much they pollute, and how
    much we pay to let them do it, is perhaps a first step.

  zh: 在余下的演讲中，哈代恩探讨了如何通过征税或使某些银行行为合法化来结束或控制这种污染。这也是富有启发性的，尽管显露出来的观点是找到解决方案本身并不困难。困难的是在银行反对的情况下聚集政治意愿采取行动。公布他们污染的程度以及我们为此付出的代价，或许是第一步。
