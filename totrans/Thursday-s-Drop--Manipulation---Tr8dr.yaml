- en: There is a lot of nervousness over both the bullish market recovery of recent
    months and credit issues in the eurozone.    Due to this lack of confidence, the
    market is easily manipulated on the downside.   That is not to say that the market
    does not require correction (I think it does), but yesterday’s drop appears to
    be more of a manufactured event.

- en: I was watching a number of stocks (such as AAPL) yesterday.    Saw a 16% drop
    on the back of no additional news.   It appears that multiple 1 cent sell orders
    for 100 shares in a basket of popular stocks was put in.    Naturally this knocked
    over many algos, prompting dramatic selling for a short period.

- en: The claim is that was a fat-finger exercise, but I think it could just as easily
    be an extreme case of the sort of manipulation that occurs everyday in enticing
    algorithms and traders to react to small price shocks, revealing their hand or
    pushing the stock in a given direction.

    all the more effective.    Algos beware 😉

- en: It appears that there were greater than 30 sell orders for 0.0001 on at least
    1 stock and probably a similar pattern on the others.   This would clean out the
    order book and as separate orders push the orderbook lower with each order.  
    See this [link](http://seekingalpha.com/article/203603-the-yen-did-it).    The
    author speculates that dramatic yen buying was the trigger.   It is possible that
    an algo reacted to strong yen buying and put in limit orders to liquidate a basket
    of equities (though a very poorly thought out exit strategy).**

    equally likely.
