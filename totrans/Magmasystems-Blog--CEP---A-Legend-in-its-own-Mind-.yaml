    counterparty risk. "No software can replace [good] judgment," says Jeff Wooten,
    VP of [Aleri](http://www.aleri.com/). "What [CEP] software can do is give you
    better information with which to make those judgments and a better understanding
    of where you stand."

    quicker than if you were to code one from scratch. But, I don't see that the CEP
    system will give you "better information". (To be fair, since Aleri has a real-time
    OLAP product, you might get better information by using the Aleri-specific visualization
    tool. Maybe that is what Jeff was implying.)

    important to actually use the risk numbers that are already available."
