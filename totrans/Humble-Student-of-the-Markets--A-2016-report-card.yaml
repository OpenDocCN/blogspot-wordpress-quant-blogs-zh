    calls. My inner investor performed very well, though my inner trader suffered
    a number of hiccups. Overall, I had a solid year in 2016.

    based on a 6-24 month time horizon. I remained steadfastly bullish for most of
    2016 even as others panicked. The jury is still out on my latest call for a correction
    in early 2017 (see

- en: The chart below depicts the calls of my trading model. While they appeared to
    be very good at first glance, I discovered a couple of problems in implementing
    the trades.
  prefs: []

- en: First, the model was a little slow and did not react to the slow deterioration
    in the market during the late summer. Even as the model remained long, the slow
    drip-drip-drip downtrend in prices (marked by the white arrow in the chart) was
    a little disconcerting. As the trading model is based on sensing changes in price
    trends, the lack of trade signals highlights a problem when the market moves sideways.
  prefs: []

- en: On the other hand, another problem arose when the model became overly sensitized
    to changes in prices. The trading model experienced whipsawing signals in the
    aftermath of the Brexit election (buy to sell to buy within a few days) and the
    US election (buy to sell to buy in the overnight futures market). These two issue
    highlight the need for further research in the future.

    by the perfect signal, then you miss on your execution, which results in an unfortunate
