    higher than widely believed. He said that too much emphasis is being given to
    the idea that the recession implies that the output gap is currently quite large,
    minimizing the risk of inflation.

    keep rates low enough for long enough to create a period of above-normal inflation.
    The arguments in favor of such a policy hinge on a clear understanding on the
    part of the public that the central bank will tolerate increased inflation only
    temporarily--say, for a few years once the economy has recovered--before returning
    to the original inflation target in the long term. In standard theoretical model
    environments, long-run inflation expectations are perfectly anchored. In reality,
    however, the anchoring of inflation expectations has been a hard-won achievement
    of monetary policy over the past few decades, and we should not take this stability
    for granted. Models are by their nature only a stylized representation of reality,
    and ***a policy of achieving "temporarily" higher inflation over the medium term
    would run the risk of altering inflation expectations beyond the horizon that
    is desirable. Were that to happen, the costs of bringing expectations back to
    their current anchored state might be quite high.***
