    She went on to outline the differing outlooks for the three major trading blocs
    in the world, the US, EU, and China, plus emerging market economies.

    the year we leave behind. Why? Because the three big economies, U.S., E.U., China,
    are all slowing down simultaneously. The US is most resilient. The U.S. may avoid
    recession. We see the labor market remaining quite strong. This is, however, mixed
    blessing because if the labor market is very strong, the Fed may have to keep
    interest rates tighter for- for longer to bring inflation down. The E.U. very
    severely hit by the war in Ukraine. Half of the European Union will be in recession
    next year. China is going to slow down this year further. Next year will be a
    tough year for China. And that translates into negative trends globally. When
    we look at the emerging markets in developing economies, there, the picture is
    even direr. Why? Because on top of everything else, they get hit by high interest
    rates and by the appreciation of the dollar. For those economies that have high
    level of that, this is a devastation.

    forecast, which is very similar to the consensus view of the global economy. From
    a relative performance viewpoint, US equities have skidded badly in the last two
    months, while European equities have soared. While the Chinese and Japanese Asian
    markets have staged relative rebounds in the same time frame, they remain range
    bound on a relative basis, and so does EM ex-China.
