    we examined the ungainly rainbow Hydra that comprise the nine bounces from a sub-10
    VIX close over the past 17 years. Today our intent is to bring order from that
    chaos in the form of a composite view of those bounces, where the aggregate picture
    tells a more concise story than the individual ones:'

    the sub-10 close, with some sideways meandering thereafter, an aggregate high
    12 days out, and finally a slow return to lower levels.

- en: Today’s close of 10.65 on day nine is the lowest day nine close to date. If
    the current pattern follows form, we will have a three day rise of a little more
    than half a point, followed by a gradual return to the current level over the
    next ten day period. As a reminder, it should be noted that the current ‘bounce’
    has produced the lowest low for days 5-9 so far, with the distinct possibility
    that the day 3 peak of 11.46 will hold up as the high value for the 20 days following
    the sub-10 close.

    a sub-10 close for a moment, today was the only the third time in the past 13
    years that the VIX’s 20 day SMA made a new low. The last time this happened, on
    11/22/06, the VIX jumped 15% in three days and 25% in 10 days. Prior to that,
    that last new 20 day SMA low was on 1/10/94, when the VIX moved up 13% in three
    days and 30% in 20 days.

    absolute values. I suspect the balance of the week will tell us which script to
    follow.
