    [term structure](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/term%20structure)
    have been in [backwardation](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/backwardation)
    each day for more than three consecutive months. In fact, the current streak of
    68 days eclipses the old record of 63 days that dates to the 2008 financial crisis.

    at the full VIX futures term structure, the futures curve has reverted to [contango](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/contango)
    five times over the course of the past three weeks. The primary reason that the
    front two months have remained in backwardation in defiance of the rest of the
    VIX futures term structure has to do with something I call the “[holiday effect](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Holiday%20Effect)”
    or “[calendar reversion](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/calendar%20reversion).”
    Essentially, what happened a little over two weeks ago was that the roll from
    the October front month to the November front month VIX futures, as well as from
    the November second month to the December second month VIX futures has added some
    incremental holiday effect backwardation to the front two months. This is due
    to the fact that the second month VIX futures have an expiration of December 21^(st),
    and these are artificially depressed due to the historically low volatility associated
    with the holiday season. The impact is being felt by all the short-term VIX futures
    ETPs that are buying second month (December) VIX futures at artificially depressed
    levels and selling front month (November) VIX futures as part of the daily rebalancing
    process.

    and second month VIX futures. Note that it is not until February 2012 that the
    term structure starts to flatten out, as investors begin to converge on the idea
    that the VIX is likely to hug the 30 level for the better part of the first half
    of next year.
