- en: Just a quick post to tell you not to be surprised if I change the theme of my
    blog, or at the very least the font size, during the day, some reader have brought
    to my attention the difficulty to read posts. I will be experimenting with WordPress’
    themes and HTML today to find a solution. It is made harder by the fact that I
    don’t really want to take a blog theme already used by the quant blogosphere big
    players (a real shame since they are pretty nice). Regardless, expect a post testing
    the time machine algorithm on different asset classes; commodities, currencies
    later today.
