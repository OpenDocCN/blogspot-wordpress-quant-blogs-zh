    long downward legs, the first leg running from 2001-2004 and the most recent leg
    from the end of 2005 to the present.

- en: From a technical perspective, it is still too early to say that the dollar has
    begun a decisive new uptrend.  Since 2001, there have been quite a few 3-4 month
    countertrend rallies and one full year (2005) in which the dollar looked to be
    making a new bullish leg before reverting back to the long-term downtrend.

    first time in over a year.  Looking at macroeconomic and other factors, I believe
    that a channel breakout is the most likely scenario, which will bring a new technical
    twist to currencies, commodities, bonds and equities.
