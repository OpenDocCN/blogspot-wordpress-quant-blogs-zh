    it affected every financial sector pretty similarly. Below are the total returns
    from April 30 2008 through March 31 2009, for a variety of financial institutions
    with market cap greater than $30MM as of April 2008 (about 800 firms).

    mortgage ownership. It suggests that while mortgages may have started the crisis,
    the real problem was the amplification process that decimated everything. To this
    day only mortgage backed debt has had abnormally large loss rates. Speculative
    grade defaults for 2008 were 4.1%, which makes it the 12th worst year in the last
    30, hardly consistent with the market debacle of the past 12 months. Auto loans,
    credit cards, etc. have reported an increase in losses, but are holding up pretty
    well. Everyone expects them to get much worse, but that's a forecast.

    doing better than most countries. This is all quite puzzling, as it appears the
    amplification mechanism is much more important than the initial cause. I don't
    really understand that mechanism.
