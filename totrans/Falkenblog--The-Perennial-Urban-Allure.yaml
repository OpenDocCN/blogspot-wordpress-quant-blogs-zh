    hipsters and homosexuals generate the innovation of great cities like Manhattan
    and San Francisco. I think his theory is simply wishful thinking, unsupported

    and density spur economic growth... everyone seems to agree that denser cities
    and suburbs, denser metros and regions, add to growth...We know that cities and

    arguing that urbanization was key to the Enlightenment and the Industrial Revolution,
    and thereby, to modern civilization.

    as today: freedom from a set life pattern and higher urban wages. I would like
    to think people are more motivated by self-actualization that comes from finding
    one''s true niche in life, but looking at pop culture I think it''s more simply
    a desire to socialize with peers (dancing, sleeping around, laughing with friends).
     Even today, young people, especially women, flee rural areas for cities (see
    population density graph above right).  For centuries, young people think their
    best interests are served in a metropolis.'

    and the key is probably they like the sexual or mating opportunities inherent
    in large groups. Playing to that angle would bring in hipsters and gays. As to
    whether that's the key to the health of cities or our nation, I doubt it, but
    it won't hurt, especially because one of the best ways of making a city fun to
    go out in is that it's safe for young women.

  zh: 移居城市的人们从一开始就是不理性的冒险者。关键可能是他们喜欢大群体中固有的性或交配机会。利用这一点将吸引时髦人士和同性恋者。至于这是否是城市或我们国家健康的关键，我怀疑，但这不会有害，特别是因为使城市适合年轻女性外出的最佳方式之一就是安全。
