    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    2018 episode as a template, there are definite indications that the market has
    overrun its rising trend line and a soaring net new highs to lows, which are signs
    of a melt-up. By comparison, the advance in the summer of 2018 was far more orderly.
    From a technical perspective, there are not the same warnings of an imminent market
    top that we saw in early 2018\. In January 2018, the market broke down without
    any negative RSI divergences, but did see a negative NYSI divergence. Today, there
    are neither RSI nor NYSI negative divergences, which could mean that this rally
    has more room to run.

    a challenge to the bulls. Iran has vowed to retaliate for the targeted assassination,
    and the geopolitical risk premium has spiked as a result. Are we headed for a
    melt-up hangover? We discuss the bull and bear cases.
