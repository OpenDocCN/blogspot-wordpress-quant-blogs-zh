- en: I made a comment in my last posting about RTI, a small messaging and CEP vendor.
    It seems that RTI got its start in the defense industry. Coincidentally, IBM is
    allowed to mention the fact that its System S arose out of a 4-year defense contract.

- en: CEP vendors who grew out of the DBMS sector might have certain advantages, but
    ones who grew out of defense have other advantages. First, you would expect that
    anything that had to pass Military testing and certification would be industrial
    strength. These systems would have to be able to handle a huge throughput of signals
    and would have to be able to react correctly to the input .. after all, you don't
    want our ships firing a missle at a seagull. Second, the analysis tools have to
    be top-rate ... detecting a signal and firing a missle is much like pulling the
    trigger on a trade. Both have enormous consequences, and once out there, cannot
    be retracted.

    defense industry might not have to worry about guaranteed delivery. It seems to
    be OK to drop a few signals (events messages) that the radars send out, and eventually
    (a few milli-seconds later), the signals would resume.
