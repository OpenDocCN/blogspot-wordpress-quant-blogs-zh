    due for one. The chart of the Shanghai Composite shows that the index violated
    a key support level last night, which is an indicator of heightened stress.

    wait for either an upside or downside breakout as an indicator of near-term direction.

    to an index of values in 100 major cities compiled by the China Index Academy,
    an independent real estate firm. Average prices in the Shanghai area are down
    about 40% from their peak in mid-2009, to about $176,000 for a 1,000-square-foot
    home.

    the market, and more than 1,000 real estate agencies have closed this year. Developers
    who once pre-sold housing projects within hours are growing desperate. A real
    estate company in the eastern city of Wenzhou is offering to throw in a new BMW
    with a home purchase.

    the average primary market housing price across China’s top 100 cities dropped
    for the third month in a row in November, by 0.3% month-on-month, with prices
    in 43 cities still rising and 57 cities falling. However, other real estate agencies
    reported steeper drops in specific locations. Homelink said that in November alone,
    primary market prices in Beijing dropped 35% month-on-month, and industry sources
    told the Legal Evening Post they dropped 16.8% week-on-week in the last week of
    November, down 29% year-on-year. [According to *Caijing* magazine](http://english.caijing.com.cn/2011-12-05/111486165.html),
    Beijing home sales volume (by area) in the first 11 months of 2011 was down 27%
    year-on-year, to a 10-year record low. A similar fall-off was evident in commercial
    as well as residential real estate. According to the Beijing Morning Post, sales
    volume for retail and office space in the capital dropped 18% and 7.4% respectively
    in October, month-on-month. Homelink’s chief Beijing analyst, Zhang Yue, told
    the paper he saw a growing supply glut developing.

    housing sales volumes in Shanghai are the worst since 2006, while *Chinese Business
    News* reported that in Shenzhen, primary prices were down 10.7% and transactions
    down 11.3% week-on-week in the last week of November. *Business China* also reported

    market prices is the biggest question of all. As I’ve mentioned many times, ***many
    people in China buy multiple units of housing in order to hold them empty indefinitely,
    as a form of savings***. They do this because they have few attractive alternatives
    and because they have faith that housing prices will go up. ***Since many have
    paid cash, they aren’t under the same immediate pressure to sell as developers***.
    But they do tend to look to rising primary market prices for assurance that their
    investments are profitable and safe, and now those prices are now plummeting.
    ***A great deal depends on whether they hunker down to weather the storm, or join
    the fire sale.***

    there may be other forms of leverage in property purchases. Depending on how pervasive
    the level of financial leverage, sales could create a cascade of falling Chinese
    property prices.

    of an email he received, which makes equally interesting reading. It came from
    a real estate agent representing a condo owner in one of the city’s top apartment
    buildings, in the Central Business District (CBD). Although he had no mortgage,
    and owned the unit outright, he was desperate to sell in order to raise RMB 20
    million for his business. So it’s worth keeping in mind that, while many Chinese
    investors may not be ***directly*** leveraged on their real estate investments,
    given the credit explosion that has driven the Chinese economy these past few
    years, they may be ***highly*** leveraged in their business or other ways that
    could turn them into distressed sellers.
