    the average primary market housing price across China’s top 100 cities dropped
    for the third month in a row in November, by 0.3% month-on-month, with prices
    in 43 cities still rising and 57 cities falling. However, other real estate agencies
    reported steeper drops in specific locations. Homelink said that in November alone,
    primary market prices in Beijing dropped 35% month-on-month, and industry sources
    told the Legal Evening Post they dropped 16.8% week-on-week in the last week of
    November, down 29% year-on-year. [According to *Caijing* magazine](http://english.caijing.com.cn/2011-12-05/111486165.html),
    Beijing home sales volume (by area) in the first 11 months of 2011 was down 27%
    year-on-year, to a 10-year record low. A similar fall-off was evident in commercial
    as well as residential real estate. According to the Beijing Morning Post, sales
    volume for retail and office space in the capital dropped 18% and 7.4% respectively
    in October, month-on-month. Homelink’s chief Beijing analyst, Zhang Yue, told
    the paper he saw a growing supply glut developing.

- en: How investors in the secondary market will react to the collapse in primary
    market prices is the biggest question of all. As I’ve mentioned many times, ***many
    people in China buy multiple units of housing in order to hold them empty indefinitely,
    as a form of savings***. They do this because they have few attractive alternatives
    and because they have faith that housing prices will go up. ***Since many have
    paid cash, they aren’t under the same immediate pressure to sell as developers***.
    But they do tend to look to rising primary market prices for assurance that their
    investments are profitable and safe, and now those prices are now plummeting.
    ***A great deal depends on whether they hunker down to weather the storm, or join
    the fire sale.***

  zh: 二手市场投资者将如何对待一手市场价格的崩盘是最大的问题。正如我多次提到的，***许多中国人购买多套住房单位，以期永远空置，作为储蓄的一种形式***。他们这样做是因为没有多少有吸引力的选择，同时他们相信住房价格会上涨。***由于许多人已经付过现金，他们不像开发商一样有立即出售的压力***。但他们实际上倾向于寻找上涨的一手市场价格来保证他们的投资是有利可图和安全的，而现在这些价格正在迅速下跌。***很大程度上取决于他们是选择坐下来渡过难关，还是参与大甩卖。***

    there may be other forms of leverage in property purchases. Depending on how pervasive
    the level of financial leverage, sales could create a cascade of falling Chinese

- en: Beijing-based blogger Bill Bishop recently [related the story](http://www.sinocism.com/?p=3067)
    of an email he received, which makes equally interesting reading. It came from
    a real estate agent representing a condo owner in one of the city’s top apartment
    buildings, in the Central Business District (CBD). Although he had no mortgage,
    and owned the unit outright, he was desperate to sell in order to raise RMB 20
    million for his business. So it’s worth keeping in mind that, while many Chinese
    investors may not be ***directly*** leveraged on their real estate investments,
    given the credit explosion that has driven the Chinese economy these past few
    years, they may be ***highly*** leveraged in their business or other ways that
    could turn them into distressed sellers.

  zh: 本文由驻京博主Bill Bishop最近 [讲述了一个故事](http://www.sinocism.com/?p=3067) ，讲述了他收到的一封电子邮件，内容同样引人入胜。邮件来自一位房地产经纪人，他代表商业中心区（CBD）的一座顶级公寓大楼的一名业主。尽管他没有按揭，而且完全拥有该单元，但他急于出售，以筹集2000万元人民币用于自己的生意。
    所以值得记住的是，虽然许多中国投资者可能并未直接利用他们的房地产投资，但鉴于过去几年推动中国经济的信贷大幅扩张，他们可能在生意或其他方面上高度杠杆，这可能会使他们成为不得已出售的卖家。
