# Busy with Excelsior | All things finance and technology…

> 来源：[https://mhittesdorf.wordpress.com/2010/03/14/busy-with-excelsior/#0001-01-01](https://mhittesdorf.wordpress.com/2010/03/14/busy-with-excelsior/#0001-01-01)

I spent way too much time this weekend on my computer refactoring Excelsior to further enforce the separation between the Long Short Equity example and the Excelsior framework.  This should make it much easier to see what classes need to be implemented when developing a new strategy with Excelsior. You can get the latest code from SourceForge. Beware though that this new version has not been tested at all! I’ll try to get to that next weekend.
