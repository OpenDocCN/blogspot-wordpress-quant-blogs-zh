# Humble Student of the Markets: A track record update

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2017/03/a-track-record-update.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2017/03/a-track-record-update.html#0001-01-01)

I have had a number of subscribers ask me to extend the chart of my longer term calls, which had only gone back two years. The chart below shows the highlights of my posts back to 2013, which are intended for investors with a 6-24 month time horizon. I haven't been always right. On occasion, I was early, late, or simply mistaken.

Here is the links to the past posts shown in the above chart.

In addition, these are the buy and sell calls of the trading model, which are designed for traders with a 1-2 week time horizon. Again, I haven't been always right. The most recent failure occurred when the trading model got caught long (and wrong) in the correction in late 2015.

Judge for yourself.
