- en: From the standpoint of the financial markets, we can anticipate an increase
    in mortgage delinquencies in the coming months if only from the combination of
    high unemployment, high loan-to-value ratios, and a gradual movement into the
    heaviest portion of reset schedule on Alt-A and Option-Arm mortgages written at
    the peak of the housing bubble. That this will result in true credit losses is
    virtually certain. Whether or not this leads to fresh reported credit losses depends
    on how much latitude regulators allow in maintaining current (substantially written-up)
    values for securities that are not delivering the underlying cash flows.

    earnings, to an extent that exceeds nearly every pre-1995 level except 1929\.
    Intermediate term conditions are strenuously overbought, investors (with advisory
    sentiment now down to 15.6% bearishness) are clearly overbullish, and interest
    rate trends are pushing higher. This situation does not always resolve itself
    into market declines, and indeed, given that market internals remain reasonably
    firm, we may continue to observe marginal new highs for some amount of time. But
    the statistical regularity from overvalued, overbought, overbullish, rising yield
    environments is one of steep, abrupt market losses generally within a period of
    about 10-12 weeks.

    the tape. How the market reacts to news such as the items mentioned, as well as
    the NFP report, will set the short-term tone for market direction.
