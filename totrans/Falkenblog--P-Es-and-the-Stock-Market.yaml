    financial crisis, it is difficult for many, if not most people, to see this as
    anything but terribly inefficient, and most of all, predictable. Maybe not right
    away, but over the long run.

    a very cautious look about housing. He noted it rose a lot recently, and such
    a rise was improbable going forward. But he did not say an aggregate price decline
    was likely or even significantly probable.'

    very useful, but in practice not. Robert Shiller keeps historical data for the

    which I defined as the annualized future 5 year stock return minus the average
    Long Term Treasury bond yield. There's a nice negative correlation between this
    future return and current P/E ratios (Shiller uses the prior 10 years earnings
    for his denominator). One thinks, hey, this is a pretty obvious investing signal.

- en: Yet, on a monthly level, the signal is horrible. If you look at the current
    P/E, and compare this to the then historical data, there's a very small relation
    with month-ahead returns. Given the upward drift in the stock market over time,
    and rule based on historal P/Es, where you choose to invest/not-invest based on,
    say, being in the 90th percentile of P/Es, lowers your annual return.

- en: But, the correlation on a longer basis seems much better, and so, if you chose
    a rule to say, invest/not-invest every 5 years come hell-or-high-water, this surely
    generates a much better return? No. One way to see this is the graph below. Here
    I calculated the ratio of the earnings yield to the Treasury rate(earnings/price
    normalized by the interest rate as represented by the long term Treasury rate).
    One sees a very tight relation from 1920 through 1960, perhaps even to 1980, but
    you would have missed the bull run of the 1890's and 1980-2000\. Any rule here,
    over the entire century, generates no real gain.

- en: The bottom line is that many trends that seem really good, work over long periods
    of time, but for only half the time. In an up-trending market, anything that tempts
    you to sit on the sidelines is swimming against the stream. For assets that historically
    have trended upward, like housing or stocks, it is never obvious when to move
    totally out of the position.
