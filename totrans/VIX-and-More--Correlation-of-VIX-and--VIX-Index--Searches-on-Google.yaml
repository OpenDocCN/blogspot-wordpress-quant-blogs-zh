    for the [chart of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week)
    contest was probably a little short sighted on my part, particularly given the
    very high quality of the entries.

    oblige. One of the contenders for the mythical silver or bronze medal certainly
    would have been a submission from Darren Miller of [Attitrade](http://www.attitrade.com/).
    In the chart below, Darren has compared the level of the VIX with the relative
    frequency of Google searches for “VIX index” from the beginning of 2007 to the
    present.

- en: Note that prior to the October 2008 VIX spike, there were more significant spikes
    in searches for information about the VIX than in the VIX itself. Following the
    VIX peaks in October and November 2008, the demand for information about the VIX
    subsided much more rapidly than the VIX index. In fact, according to the graphic,
    the “VIX index” search activity was back to pre-crisis levels by December 2008,
    whereas it took the actual index another year to make a comparable drop.

    but the chart does bump up against some of the ideas I outlines in my [availability
    bias](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/availability%20bias) and [disaster
    imprinting](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/disaster%20imprinting)

    and psychological disaster were so severe that they continue to leave a permanent
    or semi-permanent scar in one’s psyche. Another way to describe disaster imprinting
    might be to liken it to a low level financial post-traumatic stress disorder.”*'

- en: In reviewing the chart of the VIX against corresponding Google searches, it
    is possible to conclude that availability bias and disaster imprinting are present
    in that searches for information about the VIX rapidly reverted to historical
    norms, while the level of the VIX itself was only gradually reduced over a period
    of months and months, creating a significant gap between the index and the search
    activity for almost all of 2009.
