- en: With the increased difficulty created by the recent enforcement of short selling
    rules in certain financial stocks, it would seem that there may be a greater interest
    in put buying. This is because buying a put would be an alternative way to gain
    short exposure. What we’ve seen is exactly the opposite. Last Monday the CBOE
    Total Put/Call Ratio’s 10-day MA dropped below it 200-day MA. It continued to
    drop further below it all week.

    I simply looked at how the market has performed when the 10-day MA is positioned
    either above or below the 200-day MA.
