## Thinking in Systems

I got recommended [Thinking in Systems](http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Systems-Donella-H-Meadows/dp/1603580557) whilst at the Construx Executive Summit recently.  Much discussion about feedback loops (think agile), information flow and self-organization.  Chapter 5 offers a view on system traps, and opportunities to get out of the traps e.g. policy resistance.

One particular line stood out in the book for some reason – possibly because most people forget the game has rules, and thus they don’t look to understand the rules.

> Look Beyond the Players to the Rules of the Game
