- en: A rally to new highs from these levels is unlikely. Last week's pullback inflicted
    significant technical damage that, at a minimum, a period of sideways consolidation
    and base building will be necessary before the bulls can take control of the tape
    again. The S&P 500 violated a rising trend line that stretched back to April.
    As well, the 8 day moving average (dma) fell through the 21 dma, which is a bearish
    crossover. Repairing the damage will take time.
