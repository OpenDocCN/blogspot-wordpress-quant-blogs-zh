## Axum, Where’s It Heading?

Interesting posting on the [Axum](http://blogs.msdn.com/maestroteam/archive/2010/03/19/the-rumors-of-my-death-have-been-greatly-exaggerated.aspx) blog. One can only assume that Microsoft has learnt from the current Axum incubation effort, and have move on to taking that ideas/concepts and adding them into other products. It’s unclear if we will ever see Axum as a true product.
