    recent months, looked at a variety of indicators this week and concluded that
    the most exposed countries were Brazil, South Africa, Ukraine and Turkey. It pointed
    out that a third of Turkey’s external debt was short term and that the country’s

    debt...

    a play on the abbreviation for emerging markets. But even if you are sure that
    is going to happen, forecasting the timing is far from easy.

    (HYG), which is a junk vs. junk measure of market appetite for EM assets, has

    closed lower for the week. Official intervention was largely ineffective. As an
