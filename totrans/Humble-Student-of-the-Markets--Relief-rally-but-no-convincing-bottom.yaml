    them to distract you. The equity market was oversold and certainly due for a relief
    rally. The VIX Index spiked to 41.97 on Wednesday, which is sufficiently high
    for a short-term bottom. The most important "tell" of a short-term bottom has
    been the telephone calls and emails that I received in the past week from people
    that I hadn't heard from in some time - they all wanted to hear what I thought
    of the market.
