    them to distract you. The equity market was oversold and certainly due for a relief
    rally. The VIX Index spiked to 41.97 on Wednesday, which is sufficiently high
    for a short-term bottom. The most important "tell" of a short-term bottom has
    been the telephone calls and emails that I received in the past week from people
    that I hadn't heard from in some time - they all wanted to hear what I thought
    of the market.

    the market consensus doesn't seem to quite want to concede that reality yet. A
    good indicator of sufficiently bearish sentiment occurs when commentators start
    to talk about a double-dip slowdown. Right now, I have not even seen the “double-dip”
    term in the vocabulary of the economic bears like Nouriel Robini and David Rosenberg.
