- en: With a half hour to go in today’s trading session, over one million put contracts
    have already been traded on the S&P 500 index, which is about 2 ½ times the average
    daily volume. This elevated put volume comes on top of 913,000 SPX put contracts
    yesterday, which was the second highest for 2012.

- en: The one million level is rarely seen in SPX puts and generally indicates an
    extreme amount of hedging on the part of institutional investors, as well as increased
    speculative activity.

- en: Looking at the chart below, which goes back two years, one can see that in those
    rare instances when put volume (vertical red bars on lower half of chart) reached
    one million, this typically coincided with a bottom in stocks.  *[Edit:  today’s
    finally tally is 1.28 million SPX puts, the highest total since August 9, 2011]*

    equities only [call to put](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/put%20to%20call)
    ratio. The indicator I have developed which is based on the ISEE is now showing
    is greatest contrarian bullish bias (due to a preponderance of put volume) since
    the end of June 2010, just two days before the SPX put in an key bottom at 1010.

    of the current worries about [Greece](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Greece)
    and [Spain](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Spain), but the odds now
    favor stocks finding at least a short-term bottom very soon.
