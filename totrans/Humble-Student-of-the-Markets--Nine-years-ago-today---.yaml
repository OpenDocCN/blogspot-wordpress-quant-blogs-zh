    That makes conceptual sense, because hedge funds are in the business of taking
    risk and equity risk is a major component of investing risk.

    unfair to compare them against equities. Bloomberg showed that their performance
    against a balanced fund benchmark has been nothing to write home about either.

    Many HF strategies, such as convertible arbitrage, long/short equity, event-driven,
    emerging markets, and so on, can be approximated by combinations of factors. In
    other words, you were paying for beta when you thought you were buying alpha.
    Since then, even those beta strategies have turned into...I don't know what as
    aggregate HFRX Indices have flattened out over the last few years.

    early 1990's, when swashbuckling managers like Julian Robertson and George Soros
    dominated the field, a billion dollar hedge fund was an enormous fund. Today,
    a fund with AUM that size just gets lost in the crowd.
