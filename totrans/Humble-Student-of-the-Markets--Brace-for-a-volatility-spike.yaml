    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    signal. A bullish Trend Model signal that gets less bullish is a trading "sell"
    signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading
    "buy" signal. The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of
    the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. Past trading of
    the trading model has shown turnover rates of about 200% per month.

    participants continued to report substantial uncertainty about potential changes
    in fiscal, regulatory, and other government policies. Nonetheless, measures of
    implied volatility of various asset prices remained low.

    though stock prices were grinding upwards, VIX term structure began to steepen
    as 3-month VIX futures rose but 1-month VIX remained stable. As well, the bottom
    panel shows that SKEW, which measures the price of tail-risk protection, is rising.
    These readings indicate that the market is anticipating a near-term volatility
    event.

    on Tuesday, when he is expected to outline his tax reform proposals. This speech
    has the potential to raise the "uncertainty about potential changes in fiscal,
    regulatory, and other government policies".

    of tax cuts, tax holiday for offshore cash repatriation, and deregulation. As
    Trump's tax reform proposals become more clear, it is becoming evident that there
    are two likely outcomes. Either Wall Street will have to swallow the bitter pill
    of the protectionist measures of a Border Adjustment Tax (BAT), or they will get
    delayed and bogged down in Congress.
