- en: Since the 1/28 market drop due to Egyptian protests the market has risen without
    hardly a pause.  It has now been 2 weeks since the last time SPY closed above
    its 5-day moving average.  The 5-day is quite short-term so this is a fairly rare
    occurence.  The study below examines other instances where this has happened.

    We see above what appears to be a decent downside edge. It appears most of the
    downside damage is done in the first 2 days.
