    the blog. The last time I did was in July. But 2012 was another solid year and
    I hope to help traders in 2013 as well.  I don’t post results regularly because
    while I've always tracked trade ideas in the subscriber letter, it isn't the main
    focus of the service. I don't consider Quantifiable Edges to be a stock picking
    service. I consider it one where traders can gain market and trading knowledge
    through the published research, systems, and tools. The objective is to provide
    tools and instruction to help traders improve their own trading and results.

    was the only month where the trade ideas failed to add up to positive gains. I've
    had several letters from subscribers lately telling me they've done quite well
    following certain ideas and that is always nice to hear.

    represent any kind of complete portfolio strategy. They are what they are - ideas
    about certain stocks or ETFs that have historically provided a statistical edge.

    highly liquid large cap stocks (almost exclusively S&P 100 components). I do this
    so that executing trades and getting fills at reasonable prices is not an issue.
    I think traders feel the most frustrating aspect of following trade ideas offered
    by some services is not being able to get into or out of the trades that they
    suggest at a similar price. I’ve addressed this problem with limit prices and
    highly liquid securities.

    their trading through the use of quantified research, and while doing so to help
    them offset the costs of the subscription by offering easy-to-execute trade ideas
    with a long-term positive profit expectancy. To date I believe Quantifiable Edges
    has succeeded in doing this.

    purposes I only count trades after they have been closed out. With most trades
    being of the swing variety this doesn’t normally skew results much. But it does
    occasionally when a big trade lasts over a month or year-end.

    the years and that selectivity paid off nicely in 2012\.  Despite being the year
    with the lowest number of trade ideas published (97), it was #2 in total gains.
     It showed the highest win % at over 78%, the lowest average loss, and the highest
    profit factor by far, with gross gains over 9x the size of gross losses.'

    and instruction to improve their trading. These ideas may come in the form of
    previously published studies identified by the Quantifinder, or they may be something
    I discuss in the current subscriber letter, or perhaps it's a webinar focused
    on a certain trading approach or indicator, or any other number of tools that
    I've designed and made available. (For a more complete list of tools, see the
    "Using Quantifiable Edges" series of posts.) The trade ideas found in the subscriber
    letter are examples of how I put these tools and ideas to work. While past performance
    is not necessarily indicative of future results, over the long run they’ve performed
    well enough that many subscribers have used them for their benefit.

- en: '*All trade ideas ever tracked in the Quantifiable Edges Subscriber Letter may
    be found on this spreadsheet. I don’t suggest position sizes. The primary reason
    for this is I’m not acting as a financial advisor. I don’t feel it is appropriate
    to suggest allocation sizes without understanding someone’s financial situation
    and risk tolerance. Even for my own trading I run different portfolios with different
    levels of aggressiveness. For instance, my most aggressive may use options to
    sometimes get 300-400% leveraged. Other portfolios on the other hand normally
    take much more conservative stances and some rarely reach or exceed 100% exposure.**Since
    I don’t suggest position sizes this is should not be considered a performance
    report, but rather a trade idea scorecard. Therefore, no matter how objective
    I try to be the reporting of the results is always going to be skewed depending
    on how you approach the trades. For instance, I always recommend scaling into
    the Catapult positions in 3 parts, whereas the “System” trades (whatever system
    I unveil other than Catapult) are normally one entry. The “Index” trades I normally
    recommend scaling into as well. For my own trading I trade much larger size with
    the index trades than any of the individuals. I also control my exposure by limiting
    the total amount invested per day. As I mentioned, this will vary depending on
    the account I’m trading. My most aggressive account I may put in up to 100%/day
    and get heavily leveraged using options. A more conservative account may max out
    at 15%-20% per day.**It’s unlikely anyone would have taken all of the trades with
    equal amounts, so personal results would vary greatly depending on the trader’s
    approach. Simply adding up the results of the individual triggers as I do is an
    admittedly poor representation of returns. A net positive or negative does not
    necessarily mean a person following the ideas would have made or lost money during
    the period measured. And the sum total is certainly not representative of what
    a portfolio would return. **Feel free to contact me at support @ QuantifiableEdges.com
    if you have any questions.**As required by the NFA: Except where otherwise specifically
    stated, all trades are based on hypothetical or simulated trading. Hypothetical
    or simulated performance results have certain inherent limitations. Unlike an
    actual performance record, simulated results do not represent actual trading.
    Also, since the trades have not actually been executed, the results may have under-or-over-compensated
    for the impact, if any, of certain market factors, such as lack of liquidity.
    Simulated trading programs in general are also subject to the fact that they are
    designed with the benefit of hindsight. No representation is being made that any
    account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown.
    Commissions, fees, and slippage have not been included. This is neither a solicitation
    to buy/sell securities or listed options.*'
