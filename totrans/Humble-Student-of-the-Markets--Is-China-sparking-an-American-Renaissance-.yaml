    1.6% y/y through January. It has been deflating since March 2012\. China’s CPI

    The pace of onshoring would accelerate as the advantages of offshoring to China
    diminish, which implies a higher economic growth rate as jobs return to US manufacturing.
    As well, operating margins could expand because the cost of inputs would fall
    because of lower commodity prices. These are the ingredients for an American Renaissance.

    Operating margins are likely to get boosted upwards because of lower input costs

    educated labor force and lower transportation costs from being closer to end consumer
    markets. As well, the returns to capital are likely to improve as cheaper automation
    drive down the price of capital expenditures, which raises overall returns on
