    it comes to predicting the future of volatility, but this fact is obviously is
    not dissuading at the moment.

- en: Looking at the VIX futures, the second month futures are trading at 3.30 point
    higher than the front month, continuing the trend of 21 consecutive trading days
    with at least an 8% premium for the second month over the front month VIX futures.
    Call it the “[contango](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/contango)
    rip tide” if you will.

    Calls Attracting Interest](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/07/vxx-calls-attracting-interest.html)
    and wondered aloud whether “there is a little desperation in the air that may
    be triggering some revenge trades in VXX.”

- en: It is certainly not difficult to make the case for a rise in volatility from
    current levels, but with negative [roll yield](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/roll%20yield),
    [time decay](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/time%20decay) and other
    factors, that doesn’t necessarily mean VXX calls will be profitable trades if
    this turns out to be the case.
