    seem dramatic or extreme, consider that the markets did not make sense from a
    CAPM world view during the best (and simplest) of times. Today, the world markets
    are a strange and dangerous place. We are in the midst of the era of dominance
    for computerized trading (think Skynet from the Terminator). Floor trader jackets
    will soon become museum relics or sold as collector’s items on E-Bay. Most of
    the retail investors and individual traders have left the market entirely–outclassed,
    outgunned and tired of poor returns and being unable to compete. We are simultaneously
    in the throes of perhaps the greatest financial mess of all time. Our pithy attempts
    to control the uncontrollable with the aide of simplistic economic theory, political
    idealism, and crony capitalism has put the world in a perilous situation. The
    stress in financial markets reflect unprecedented levels of global debt, government
    intervention, unexpected shifts in sovereign risk, and banks that can lose billions
    for no obvious reason seemingly overnight.

    has rendered simplistic linear theory almost meaningless. Human behavior- a feature
    once predictable in its hybrid version of rationality and cognitive bias- no longer
    manifests in markets as a fluid mass of “greed” and “fear”. Instead, game theory
    and behavioural finance now share equal importance as players engage in Keynesian
    beauty contests with greater than six degrees of anticipation. (not to be confused
    with six degrees of separation) [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_beauty_contest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_beauty_contest)
    . The highly complex interaction between governments, banks, hedge funds, institutions,
    wealthy individuals, and high frequency firms is a multi-dimensional high stakes
    game where the rules change by the day. Players must interpret or anticipate others
    actions, the perception that other players have of their actions, and how rules
    might change and how this may affect their actions and perceptions. And this is
    a simplistic description……………..

    that can adapt to change and adequately capture the nature of complex systems.
    Ed Seykota once correctly observed that a surfer does not need to know the theory
    of fluid mechanics to learn how to surf a wave in the ocean– he needs only to
    be able to make probabilistic estimates and adjustments. This example puts the
    financial economist at odds with the scientist or the engineer. The future favors
    the practical problem-solvers, the inventors, the gamers, and the deep thinkers.
    Investing is becoming like the evolution in mixed martial arts– no single style
    or background is likely to win, nor is a stubborn resistance to learning about
    other disciplines. I predict that the theory police will resist this transition
    and be left standing naked before their disciples when the tide goes out. It is
    much easier and more comforting to explain the world in deterministic terms- replete
    with graphs of marginal utility and “proofs.” Of course it is also more comforting
    to play chess than engage in a high stakes game of “liar’s poker”.

    and avoid trying to seek academic approval from high priests of a defunct religion.
    There is nothing wrong with learning finance, economics or econometrics- in fact
    it is crucial to understand these disciplines at a high level. But it is time
    to start thinking for yourself, and to stop being a sheep. Instead one should
    favor asking hard questions, learn to think independently, collaborate effectively,
    and most importantly spend their waking hours thinking about how to solve high-dimensional
    classification and game-theoretic problems.
