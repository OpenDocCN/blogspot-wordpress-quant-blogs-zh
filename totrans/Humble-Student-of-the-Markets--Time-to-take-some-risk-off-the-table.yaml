    its 50-day moving average and a upward sloping trend line that began in June (shown
    in blue), but the longer term uptrend (in red) remains intact and the index remains
    above its 200-day moving average. This is not a disaster, nor is is a market crash
    warning.

    other averages showed similar kinds of sideways action of broken trend lines.
    As an example, the STOXX 600 moved through its 50-day moving average, though it
    is now testing an important support zone.

    is one of the most important industrial commodities, has been falling and is now
    testing an important technical support as represented by its 50% Fibonacci retracement
    level.

    rate in the US economy. While consumer confidence and employment have been rising,
    business confidence and capital investment has been falling. My hypothesis is
    that the returns to capital vs. labor got over-stretched and the balance is starting
    to swing towards labor. That's why we are seeing better employment and consumer
    confidence, but the returns to capital are diminishing and the earnings disappointment
    that we are seeing now is the result of margin compression. While the American
    economy will likely continue to growth, stock prices may not follow because margins
    - and therefore earnings are getting squeezed.

    do believe the low volatility we have seen may very well become a thing of the
