    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    melt-up in the manner of late 2017\. It is unusual to see the index remain above
    its weekly BB for more than a week, which it did two weeks ago. The melt-up of
    late 2017 also saw similar episodes of upper weekly BB rides, punctuated by brief
    pauses marked by “good overbought” conditions on the weekly stochastic. The technical
    conditions appear similar today, and I am therefore giving the intermediate term
    bull case the benefit of the doubt.
