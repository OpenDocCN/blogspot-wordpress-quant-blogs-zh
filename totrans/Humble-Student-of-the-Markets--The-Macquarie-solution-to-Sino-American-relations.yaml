    economic problem of the imbalance between China and the United States (which is

    wildly spending on excessively infrastructure, which is creating an asset bubble
    in China, why not spend it on American infrastructure? Over time, better American
    infrastructure will raise productivity and stimulate US consumer spending, which
    benefits China. It's a win-win.

    roads, bridges, etc. If the state of Illinois wanted to build a new highway, or
    if California wanted to upgrade one of its ports, or construct a desalination
    plant, it could create an authority to build that highway and then collect the
    tolls. The tolls would then be used to finance the construction. In effect, the
    Pettis proposal would change Chinese investment in the US from debt (Treasuries)
    to equity (toll roads, etc.) What's more, a for-profit construction authority
    would pay more attention to the economics of the project, which would mitigate
    much of the pork that goes on in many of these endeavors. It would create also
    American jobs in engineering and construction - another win-win.
