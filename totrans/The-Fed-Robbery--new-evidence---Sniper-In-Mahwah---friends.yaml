    yes, charts may lead to different interpretations (this is an epistemological
    problem); and yes, in this world no-one could be 100% right – but some could be
    100% wrong. In the Great Fed Robbery case, *hélas*, it seems the McKay Brothers

    received in Chicago, on January 15th, 1848 and it heralded 1848 as the “rise of
    the machine” in the Windy City. In February, the first steam-powered grain elevator
    replaced the old horse-powered elevators. In March, the Galena and Chicago Union
    Railroad started. In April, the Illinois and Michigan Canal finally opened for

    the trading of grains: the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT).'

    of information, and information needs to be transported. The first telegraphic
    message took eighteen hours to reach Chicago from Detroit, but soon speed was
    improved and information between the Windy City and New York could travel within
    a few seconds. Telegraph was seen as “*the nervous system of the nation*“, “*a
    vast arterial system which carries the pulsation of the heart to the farthest
    extremity”*, and played an important role in the development of the first “to
    arrive” products, as the product—let’s say, grains from the Midwest—could not
    reach New York as fast as the *price* of the product. Before the first official *futures* products
    were proposed by the CBOT in 1857, the “disentanglement” between the product and
    its price encouraged the traders in NY to think that the slip of paper with the
    price printed on it *was the product itself*.

    A decade later, in his(then unpublished)* Outlines of the Critique of Political
    Economy*, Karl Marx wrote about capitalism as a machine which caused « *the annihilation
    of space by time* ». Perhaps Marx was right about space: in 2013, the Chicago
    Board Options Exchange (CBOE) is no longer in Illinois but in Secaucus, New Jersey.
    Geography has changed, but time has never been annihilated, and high frequency
    trading proves that: the space of the old pits became a matching engine, the old
    human traders became algorithms (in fact, a trader is a mix between human reason
    and non-human rationality), and an exchange is now a huge data center where algorithms
    are co-located close to the matching engine. If time were annihilated, we would
    live in the best of all possible worlds but there is an issue: an algorithm working
    from Manhattan will get information slower than an algorithm co-located in New
    Jersey data centers. So, the statement « *let no man put asunder* » is nothing
    but a dream. The algorithm located in Manhanttan is is rent asunder from the matching
    engine,  and a milliseconds latency between them is now relevant. Time will never

    it is not really new. In an article published by the *Chicago Democrat* in September
    1848, five months after the birth of the CBOT, there is a story about a Chicagoan
    who had raced down the docks after receiving word from the telegraph office that
    wheat prices were rising on the East Cost. He “*immediately struck a bargain for
    a cargo at eighty cents per bushel… in less than fifteen minutes the market rose
    to eighty-five, and the fortunate possessor of the news by the last flash pocketed
    the cool five hundred*“. The words “*flash trading*” were already in the mouths
    of Chicago speculators back in the 1850s! Telegraph allowed prices to equalize
    between Chicago and the rest of the US, but more informed agents (thanks to the
    telegraph provider Western Union, which was a fierce lobbyist when the CBOT made
    its new building in 1930) were able to do arbitrage at a faster speed. Nothing
    new with HFT–except that technical market microstructures became intricate and
    gave rise to new kind of information for “[silicon traders](http://riskbooks.com/high-frequency-trading-new-realities-for-traders-markets-and-regulators)“.

    can’t not move faster than the speed of light, about 186 miles per millisecond
    in a vacuum. If stock exchanges want a level playing field, all exchanges should
    be located in one place on earth, but reality is different. Distance is a problem,
    and in the US the main challenge has always been the latency between Chicago exchanges
    (where futures are traded) and New York exchanges (where stocks are traded). Even
    if the CBOE is now in New Jersey, the CME and the CBOT (the two historical exchanges
    merged in 2007) still are in Chicago–in Aurora more precisely, where the CME Group
    has built its own data center. The Nasdaq exchange is located in Carteret, New

    in 2014 they will reduce their latency between Aurora and Cartaret to 8.147 ms.
    from 8.181 ms., thanks to the path “*which has near zero deviation from the geodesic
    perfect arc*” (here, latency is round trip time measured rack to rack). Quincy

    in November 2013 that they could “*deliver CME futures data directly into NASDAQ’s
    primary data center in Carteret, within 4.09 ms.*“, that is 0.16 ms more than
    the estimated speed of light in vacuum between the two places, 3.93 ms.  So, McKay
    Brothers seems to be the best microwaves transmitter for market data between the
    CME and Nasdaq, and if all algorithms were co-located in both the places, and
    if all those algorithms were clients of McKay, *maybe* we would have a level playing

    data feed provider and data analysis company [Nanex](http://www.nanex.net) known
    for its charts showing the “silicon traders” at work, recently discovered a discrepancy
    in the release of Fed/FOMC information on September 18th. As explained in July
    2013 by CNBC journalist Eamon Javers [here](http://www.cnbc.com/id/100880782),
    the Fed has its own data center on 1275 K Street in Washington. On September 18th
    information should have been disclosed at 2:00 PM EST from K Street and then disseminated
    to the different US markets. Though the news was given to some reporters before
    2:00 PM, the reporters were in a secured lock-up room presumably unable to leak
    information. But what [Nanex](http://www.nanex.net/aqck2/4436.html) data proves
    that Chicago and New York markets reacted to the Fed news so fast that is was
    physically impossible for the news to travel from Washington to both Chicago and
    New York. “*When the information was officially released in Washington, New York
    should see it 2 milliseconds later, and Chicago should see it 7 milliseconds later.
    Which means we should see a reaction in stocks (which trade in New York) about
    5 milliseconds before a reaction in financial futures (which trade in Chicago).
    And this is in fact what we normally see when news is released from Washington” *wrote
    Nanex in its article “[Einstein and the Great Fed Robbery](http://www.nanex.net/aqck2/4436.html)”.
    Even with the fastest microwave network or supersonic carrier pigeons, Chicago
    and New York would not have been able to react so quickly.

    a heated debate about what actually happened. HFT company Virtu responded September
    25 by publishing their [own study](http://www.virtu.com/news-22/study-of-federal-reserve.html),
    which concludes that the “*Nanex study is severely flawed*.” Attacking the veracity
     of Nanex’s data, Virtu said, “*it appears that the Nanex study relies entirely
    on the inaccurate SIP market data time stamps […] The Nanex data is clearly wrong
    because it is reflecting timestamps after the consolidation process has been completed
    by the SIP*.” Though Nanex does use the publicly available consolidated feeds
    rather than raw feeds from exchanges, Virtu’s own data corroborates Nanex’s assertion
    that Chicago markets reacted in less than Virtu’s minimal time delay estimation
    of 2.1 ms. To obtain this 2.1 ms figure, Virtu too the straight line distance
    of 204 miles from Washington DC to New York City and the straight line distance
    of 595 miles from New York to Chicago to conclude that messages travelling from
    the Capitol to New York to Chicago should arrive with a nearly speed of light
    latency. The only network capable of transmitting data that fast is currently
    a microwave network. And, as Nanex notes, “*reality is far from perfect*”; microwave
    networks are not using perfectly straight lines, so “*it’s a lot more complicated
    thatn simply using straight line distance and ignoring the realities of our world*”.

    co-location centers for both CME and Nasdaq matching engines. While Tyc elaborated
