- en: hi jez, thanks–its a long term index so alpha takes time to build with a fair
    amount of short-term variance, but it was designed to be asymmetric with more
    upside in positive markets and less downside in negative markets. it can be used
    as a ranking system, but the preferred use of the bottom 50 or bottom 10 is actually
    as a mean-reversion index that can be traded with using the RSI or DV2 etc. an
    offshoot of the livermore is that it responds especially well to trend-following
    methods–and since the index does not incorporate timing this is very beneficial.
