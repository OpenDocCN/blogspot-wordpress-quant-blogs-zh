    of markets has taken us a long way from where we ought to be. We need a more balanced

    which puts food on our table and the activity of gambling in credit default swaps.
    That confusion has enabled people to claim the virtues of the former for the latter.

    facilitating hedging etc. The value added comes from reducing the cost of doing
    so. Paul Volcker questioned the role of finance: “I wish someone would give me
    one shred of neutral evidence that financial innovation has led to economic growth
    — one shred of evidence. US financial services increased its share of value added
    from 2% to 6.5% but Is that a reflection of your financial innovation, or just
    a reflection of what you’re paid?”'

    a bit like looking at a car’s gearbox as the basis for propulsion. But financiers
    don’t necessarily agree with this assessment, unsurprisingly.
