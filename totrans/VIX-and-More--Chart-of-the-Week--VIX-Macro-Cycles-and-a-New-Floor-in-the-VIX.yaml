- en: The last time I updated my as [VIX macro cycle](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20macro%20cycles)
    chart, a little more than five months ago, the VIX had just dipped below 40.00
    and I was looking at a bottom as low as 25.00 or so. For awhile, the area around
    24.00 offered significant support, but with Wednesday’s low of 22.19, it is time
    to formally update my thinking about a new floor in the VIX and to place the current
    declining volatility environment in the context the two decades of VIX historical
    data.

    below shows seven different VIX macro cycles, typically of 2-4 years in duration,
    dating back to the 1990 historical reconstructions of VIX data. The chart highlights
    just how extreme and unusual the VIX spikes and persistent high volatility was
    during the latter part of 2008 and the first few months of 2009\. I find it interesting
    that this monthly chart shows three consecutive months of doji candlestick patterns
    with almost identical real bodies – meaning that despite the wide ranges during
    the month, for the last three months the opening and closing values of the VIX
    were very similar.

    from 1998 to 2003, strong support was found in the 20-22 range.

    while the 10-year average is 22.11.

    as a VIX floor at least through the end of the calendar year.

    consisted of a period of declining volatility, may already have ended and is almost
    certain to be over by the end of the year.
