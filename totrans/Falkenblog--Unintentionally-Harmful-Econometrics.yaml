    longer have higher earnings. But they also have greater discipline, come from
    better socio-economic backgrounds, and have higher IQ, all of which might be the
    true cause. If you don't include these in the regression, you attribute too much
    benefit to schooling via these omitted variables (that are often difficult--or
    in the case of IQ, taboo--to measure). So the book goes over all sorts of ways
    to tease out the true relationship. Foremost in this approach is the

    to go to school until the age of 16, and they had to start school in September
    at age 6\. Because school years end in June, this means kids born just before
    school starts would be 16 just before another year started, while those born just
    after would be only 15, and have to at least start another year. This causes kids
    to get different amounts of education merely because their birth date,, which
    is independent of IQ, discipline, and socio-economic status. A 'natural experiment'.

    It's the mainstay of rigorous research, but ultimately, if your result shows up
    only via coefficient t-stats in 2-stage least squares, but not a graph, it isn't
    there. The earnings are what they are, what's the difference for the kids who
    went to school an extra year? Here, we see the problem with econometrics. The
    authors are very excited by the saw-tooth pattern that shows a significant birthday
    bump around December 31 for the Angrist and Krueger study, highlighting that staying
    in school an extra year provided a statistically significant bump in earnings.

    kids born too late to skip their last grade. Sure, with enough observations it
    is significant, but not enough to change the world. It became an inspiration for
    a generation of Harvard economists like Levitt because the approach seemed to
    solve a problem using both cleverness, and high-brow econometric techniques. Yet,
    it does not follow that staying in school an extra year at 16 implies going to
    college would also help. Very few effects are linear. I could take golf lessons
    and lower my score by 10 strokes in a few lessons; it would not, over a year,
    put me on the PGA tour. The authors seem oblivious to this point.

    the inordinate amount of attention he pays to his little 3% wage increase belies
    this knowledge. The net-net inference is clearly that the 3% wage increase has
    policy implications, otherwise he, and the labor economics community, would not
    cite it so much. In the end, he doesn't think nonlinearities are relevant to his

    we should spend more money on college, but that presumes a lot of things. It assumes
    a linear extrapolation of their 16-year old findings. It assumes spending more
    money on college aid actually increases schooling, as opposed to what is charged
    by schools. It assumes people will study subjects that are actually skill related,
    as opposed to becoming film-studies majors who don't learn anything useful.

    Vacation time correlates with traditional US seasonal patterns, as music sales
    spike before Christmas when German Junge are in school for reason unrelated to
    file sharing (stockings need CDs). Basically, the empirical issue is one of institutional
    detail, know about seasonality of music sales, school schedules, time of music
    downloads, and very little to do with identifying restrictions that are emphasized

    pretentious techniques that try to avoid these issues. Vector auto-regressions,
    or natural experiments, do not obviate the need for common sense, and understanding
    of the subject to which the tool is being applied. The manifest failure to predict
    stock returns, business cycles, interest rates that became so apparent in the
    1980s caused econometricians to search for small subjects where natural experiments
    exist, and then draw some grand extrapolation. People think about the question
    less than the method, and then assume that because the results are so clean, it
    will be profound. I think many econometricians wish that it were so, so they could
    focus on what they really like, math, while still saying something interesting
    about important issues like schooling.

    estimation with 3 identifying restrictions based on some fundamental utility function,

    you don't have a result. It's academic.
