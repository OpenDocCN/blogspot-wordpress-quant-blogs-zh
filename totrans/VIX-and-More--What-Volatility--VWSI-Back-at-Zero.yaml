- en: Wednesday at Thursday may have felt like a fairly dramatic change in direction
    for the markets, but for the fourth week out of the last five, the VIX Weekly
    Sentiment Indicator ([VWSI](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VWSI))
    sits at an even zero.  While the VIX closed the week at 13.34, up 0.58 from the
    previous week, the VIX is sitting almost directly on top of its 10, 20 and 50
    day simple moving averages, which are currently showing readings of 13.49, 13.38,
    and 13.32, respectively.

    may suggest that historical precedent is siding with a larger correction in the
    equity markets, but I am not placing any volatility-related bets at this time.
