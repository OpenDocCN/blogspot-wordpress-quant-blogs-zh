## Harris on block trading

### September 25, 2006

Why do we tend to see larger deal sizes on dealer to client ECNs like [TradeWeb](http://www.tradeweb.com) than we do on interdealer ECNs like [MTS](http://www.euromts-ltd.com/) ?  As usual [Harris](http://www.tradingandexchanges.com/) is illuminating in chapter 15, on block traders.

When a dealer is approached by a trader demanding liquidity in large size, he will suspect that trader of being better informed. After all, if you’re a well informed trader about to place a winning trade, wouldn’t you size up the deal to maximise winnings ? The dealer will worry that if he takes the trade, prices will move against him, and he’ll lose money on a position he can’t unwind. He’ll also worry that the block may have been split up, and there may be more large trades to follow. So any dealer taking a large trade must be sure that his counterparty is less well informed. This isn’t a problem on quote driven markets, where we know the counterparty identity when handling an RFQ. But that can’t be the case on a market organised as an anonymous order driven exchange…
