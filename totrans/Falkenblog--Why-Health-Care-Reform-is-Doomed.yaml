    to get together and squelch competition. Specifically, this was targeted towards
    those Saturdays when football games generated an abnormal number of cars, and
    many people and businesses sold space on their private driveways. The parking
    lot owners noted horror stories about 15-year olds parking cars, or the inability
    to fully insure the cars! They had a meeting where they said parking cars 'wasn't
    a business, it was a profession', and set up a slush fund for political action.
    The 'unfair and dangerous competition' was made illegal, by basically mandating
    fixed costs that made it uneconomic for small providers of parking spaces to operate.
    The new law allowed the parking lot owners to increases prices under the pretext
    of quality, yet the result was more congestion because the parking lot owners
    were not equipped, or incented, to deal with the new volume efficiently. Quality
    was merely redefined to mean fully licensed and bonded parking lots. Creative
    people got around the prohibitions by offering people $5 'car washes' on their
    driveways that lasted several hours, which then provoked new regulation. Each
    new regulation created a new problem, which then motivated more regulation.

    conspire with legislators under the banner of 'the public interest'. They then
    can raise their prices by outlawing all sorts of competition. The unanticipated
    inefficiencies created simply raise the cry for more regulation. The net result
    is worse for everyone except a few parking lot owners and the legislators they
    support. The analogy to our current health care system is pretty straightforward,
    such as when only doctors are allowed to perform certain functions that a physicians
    assistant or nurse could easily do. But for health care it is actually much worse,
    because at least with parking lots customers paid directly for their services;
    in health care we have people spending other people's money on other people, often
    indirectly via mandates that people would never pay for themselves.

    an end in itself, the name we give to how we go about much of our lives providing
    and procuring services. When we restrict the market, it invariably makes us worse
    off because prohibiting two people from a subjectively mutually beneficial transaction
    makes them better off only under extremely rare situations (the problem of asymmetric
    information and non-aligned incentives is only amplified in a bureaucratic government
    alternative).

    to fire workers. As with our education monopoly, expect the health care professionals
    to make out best in any solution (Michelle Obama, after all, was a $317k/year
    ''diversity outreach coordinator'' for the University of Chicago Hospitals once
    her husband became a senator--we need more of those!).'

    for problems created by prior patches. One law government obeys is the The Second
    Law of Thermodynamics, so the new system will certainly be more complex. Spending
    more money will not make it better, just create new inalienable rights and patronage
    jobs paid for via the magic of deficit spending. Some day the spigot will turn
    off (eg, Chinese investors), the Laffer curve will constrain tax increases, the
    demographics will no longer have several wage earners for each person on the dole,
    and all these off-balance sheet liabilities will be too expensive. Then things
    will really get interesting.'
