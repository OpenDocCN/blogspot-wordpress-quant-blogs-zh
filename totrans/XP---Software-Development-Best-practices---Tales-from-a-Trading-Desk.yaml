    quite simply that Scrum/Kanban will not tell your developers how to develop. 
    XP has 12 practices derived from software [engineering](http://agilecoach.typepad.com/agile-coaching/2014/02/evolving-extreme-programming-practice.html)
    best practices – TDD, Paired Programming, Coding Standards being a few.  CodeCentric
    touch on the [same](https://blog.codecentric.de/en/2014/05/agile-engineering-practices-short-overview/)
    issue.  I suspect continuous integration, should really be continuous [delivery](http://www.thoughtworks.com/continuous-delivery)
    these days.  Net out, if your development teams are not familiar with XP, maybe
    its finally time to help them get educated, and move down the XP road.

    drop best practices in high stress situations.  Its unfortunate that often when
    there is a time crunch, testing is the first thing to get dropped.  Engineers
    often perceive that due to time pressure, feature complete at any cost is acceptable. 
    Unfortunately, often the team hasn’t asked the hard question back to management/stakeholders
    – you often can’t have your cake and eat it.
