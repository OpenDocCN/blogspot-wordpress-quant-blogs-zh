- en: The picture above is not a [Sharknado](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2724064/).
    It is a school of fish that are travelling together in a swarm demonstrating the
    properties of intelligent social behavior. This observation along with other examples
    in nature helped to inspire the creation of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO).

- en: PSO is a robust [stochastic optimization method](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2013/08/30/the-mighty-but-humble-micro-genetic-algorithm-mga/
    "The Mighty (but humble) Micro-Genetic Algorithm (mGA)") based upon the behavior
    of swarms observed in nature. The method captures the concept of social intelligence
    and co-operation.  PSO was developed by a social psychologist- James Kennedy and
    an engineer-Russell Eberhart in 1995\. The PSO method employs particles that exhibit
    individual and group behavior when looking for a solution within a search space.
    These particles also have a memory of where they have been. PSO is ideal for complex
    optimization problems with continuous variables- like finding portfolio or equation
    weights. I have created a simplified breakdown of the PSO methodology – which
    is actually much simpler and less esoteric than it appears. Essentially, PSO uses
    the familiar concept of momentum to move particles towards a solution.

- en: PSO is a very simple and useful methodology, and it has the added benefit of
    being much faster than [Genetic Algorithms](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2013/08/30/the-mighty-but-humble-micro-genetic-algorithm-mga/
    "The Mighty (but humble) Micro-Genetic Algorithm (mGA)"). However, its relative
    superiority is highly dependent on the type of problem. Typically the more continuous
    the variables are, and the less noisy and more continuous the search space is,
    the better its performance will be versus Genetic Algorithms–to make a broad and
    sweeping statement. But like anything else that is practical in the real world,
    it is best to consider hybrid methodologies that utilize the strengths of each
    method to create an even more flexible and efficient method.
