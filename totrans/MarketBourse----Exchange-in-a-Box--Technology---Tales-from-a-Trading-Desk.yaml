    is to let traders share trading [information](http://www.thetradenews.com/newsarticle.aspx?id=8576)
    in circles of other market participants they select, similar to choosing friends
    on social networking platforms. The functionality would allow members to minimise
    market impact by selecting who they trade with.

    or broker won’t need to run their own crossing network as this will do it for
    them at a fraction of the cost,” Mackay said. “We are hoping that getting the
    ‘exchange in a box’ technology into some big financial institutions will help
    the roll out of the second phase where we go into non-equity products,” Mackay
    said.

    from other people and what other people see of them. Layer on top of that the
    ability to have the same order in multiple types of market – such as central limit
    order book, call and quote driven,” Mackay said.
