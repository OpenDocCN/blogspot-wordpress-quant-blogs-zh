    system by buying U.S. Treasury bonds at the long end of the yield curve. The announcement
    sparked off a stock market rally that took the S&P 500 to an interim resistance
    level of 800.

    has been that we are witnessing a bear market rally, I would not be surprised
    that if the market powered itself upward and then fell back but does not test
    the bottom made last week, as expected by many technicians. Instead it bottoms
    at 5-10% above those levels, faking everyone out again.

    plan, which includes being fully weighted in equities (possibly on a dollar-cost

    bought into stocks in 2009.
