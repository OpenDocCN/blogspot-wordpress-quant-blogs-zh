- en: I was in the downtown area of Brussels two days ago, and I passed a building
    which appears to be the office of the Belgian “Service Public Fédéral”, the same which
    sold the [Houtem tower](https://sniperinmahwah.wordpress.com/2014/09/25/hft-in-my-backyard-ii/)
    to Jump Trading. That was funny to see these offices are in a tower. A “Finance
    Tower”. I am surrounded by towers.

- en: I was about to release the Part II of *HFT in my backyard* (an overview of the
    different HFT competitors using microwaves networks in Europe) but over the past
    days I have classified and read again my data, and I have found some bizarre details
    about one competitor. I need to check the data. I will post the Part III tomorrow,
    or Wednesday.
