For my readers in Asia, I will be conducting a

[pairs trading workshop](http://www.technicalanalyst.co.uk/training/pairs-trading.htm)

in Hong Kong on March 10-11\. This workshop is organized by the Technical Analyst magazine and is similar to the one I gave in London last year.

However, I have added a few useful insights based on audience feedback. As always, no prior knowledge of Matlab or advanced statistics is assumed. The numerous in-class exercises should be sufficient to bring your Matlab programming skills up to speed.
