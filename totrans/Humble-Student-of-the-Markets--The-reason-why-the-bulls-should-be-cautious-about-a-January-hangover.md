# Humble Student of the Markets: The reason why the bulls should be cautious about a January hangover

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2015/12/the-reason-why-bulls-should-be-cautious.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2015/12/the-reason-why-bulls-should-be-cautious.html#0001-01-01)

In my last post, I wrote about the possible appearance of a rare Zweig Breadth Thrust buy signal this week (see

[The 2016 macro surprise that no one talks about](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2015/12/27/the-2016-macro-surprise-that-no-one-talks-about/)

). Tuesday was the last day in the 10 day window for the ZBT buy signal to be triggered. Alas, it doesn't seem to have happened.

So where does that leave us? The near term outlook for the bulls is still constructive, as the market has rallied through a key downtrend line (shown above). Moreover, we are still in a period of seasonal strength.

However, bullishly oriented traders should be wary about overstaying their welcome. The Santa Claus rally was nice but the party is starting to get out of hand. The neighbors have called the cops and they are due to arrive very soon.
