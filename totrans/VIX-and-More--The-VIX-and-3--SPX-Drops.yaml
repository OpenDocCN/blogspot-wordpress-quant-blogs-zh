    any advance warning of a selloff or merely serve as a contrary indicator after
    the fact?

- en: Since 1990, there have been 25 instances in which the SPX has fallen 3% or more
    in one day. In analyzing those movements, it is important to remember that volatility
    has a strong tendency to cluster; as a result, a majority of the data points I
    looked at happened to fall within the same month and many were during the same
    week as another 3% drop. This should not be surprising, as almost all of the SPX
    plunges from the last decade have been triggered by the [Asian financial crisis](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/crash/etc/cron.html)
    (including the spillover into Russia and Brazil) and the unwinding of the dot
    com bubble.

- en: Note that the scales fixes the close on the day before the 3% drop at 100, so
    that percentage moves to and from that point are easier to calculate. It is worth
    highlighting that while the actual values of the VIX are not included here, only
    twice during this period did the SPX drop 3% with VIX values already below 20\.
    In fact, the median value for the VIX prior to the SPX drop is 31.21, again partly
    reflecting the clustering of volatility that results in multiple sharp drops in
    the SPX.

- en: On average, a drop in the SPX of 3% or more translates to a 14.3% spike in the
    VIX. More than half of the time, the day of the SPX 3% drop turned out to be the
    high in the VIX over this 11 day period. On average, half of that spike is retraced
    within two trading days and over 70% of that move is retraced in five days.

- en: In future posts, I will discuss in greater detail the issue of the VIX providing
    advance warning of a selloff in the broader market. Suffice it to say that while
    the graph above shows that the VIX does jump approximately 10% in the four days
    before a 3% SPX move, there is not the obvious telltale movement in the day or
    two before the selloff that might get the attention of the casual observer.
