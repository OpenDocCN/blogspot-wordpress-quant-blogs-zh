## Cloud – Finding the Alpha with Market Data

Xignite provides a [view](http://www.xignite.com/market-data/hedge-fund-data-management-focusing-on-alpha-generation/) on the market data challenges faced by hedge funds:

*   Soaring quote and execution message rates
*   Continuing fragmentation of execution venues
*   Increasing demand for multi-asset class and global data.

Xignite then goes on to offer the top 5 advantages of cloud market data, all an interesting read:

*   Top 5 [Wealth](Simplifying%20Market%20Data%20Management%20%E2%80%93%20How%20Wealth%20Managers%20Can%20Better%20Handle%20the%20Market%20Data%20Explosion) [Management](http://www.xignite.com/market-data/top-5-wealth-management-technology-challenges-addressed-by-the-cloud/) Technology Challenges Addressed by the Cloud
