- en: While skeptics abound about the usefulness of [triple ETFs](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/triple%20ETFs)
    for the long-term investor, I have been saying [since early on](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/11/prediction-direxion-triple-etfs-will.html)
    that the [Direxion](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Direxion) triple
    ETFs would revolutionize day trading.

    experiment with various approaches to trading triple ETFs, these vehicles have
    become an integral part of the day trading scene, particularly on trend days.

    Direxion added six new triple ETFs last month. While interest in the new round
    of ETFs has so far been limited, I predict at least one of the triple ETF pairs
    has a bright future. My candidates for stardom are the pair of emerging markets
    ETFs: the 3x bull ([EDC](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EDC)) and
    the -3x bear ([EDZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EDZ)). The reason
    is simply a lack of competition. At the moment, competition comes in the form
    of [EEV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EEV) the -2x UltraShort MSCI
    Emerging Markets ETF from ProShares. While EEV is a popular double inverse ETF,
    it lacks a companion +2x version for those who want a leveraged bullish play on
    emerging markets without having to short EEV.'

    the emerging markets are likely to receive. Technology is a favorite investment
    theme and a source of considerable volatility, but the current [ROM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/ROM)
    (2x) and [REW](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/REW) (-2x) have always
    been second tier ETFs in terms of popularity, lagging well behind [QLD](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/QLD)
    and [QID](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/QID), the popular NASDAQ-100
    ETFs. The new Direxion entries, [TYH](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TYH)
    (3x) and [TYP](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TYP) (-3x) clearly
    have their work cut out for them.

    markets and the popular [EFA](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EFA)
    ETF that tracks this index of European, Australasian and Far East companies. The
    3x bull ([DZK](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/DZK)) and the -3x bear
    ([DPK](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/DPK)) have a lot of appeal
    to me as a means by which to speculate or hedge in non-U.S. companies, but whether
    these funds will receive the same kind of attention as EFA remains to be seen.

    triple ETFs to 32 in their current [prospectus](http://direxionshares.com/pdfs/DRX_prospectus.pdf).
    The ETFs currently in the pipeline have a strong international (China, India,
    Latin America, BRIC) and sector (clean energy, real estate, homebuilders) flavor.
    The graphic below shows the triple ETFs currently available, with the recent additions

    might want to read my [initial post](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/11/prediction-direxion-triple-etfs-will.html)
    on the subject to get a sense of some of the risks involved.
