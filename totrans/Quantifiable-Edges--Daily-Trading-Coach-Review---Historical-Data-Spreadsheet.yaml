  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first are books I read (or read part of), and when I’m done I put them down
    and never open them again. They don’t inspire ideas. They don’t contain information
    that requires reviewing. They don’t provoke me to explore new methods or strategies.
    These books are a waste of time.

- en: The second group do get me excited about a new indicator, method, or technique.
    They are written well and with an heir of authority that leads me to explore their
    ideas further. Unfortunately, the ideas are either over-hyped, misleading, or
    too difficult to implement. Eventually, these too collect dust. On some level,
    these are worse than the 1st group since they take up even more of my time. Of
    course there is always some value in learning what doesn’t work, and at least
    these books provide me with that.

    They are sometimes inspirational, sometimes instructional, and sometimes both.

- en: Like the Traderfeed blog, it’s completely packed with inspiring information
    and ideas. Most books have 1 or 2 great ideas in them. This has too many to count.
    One thing I particularly like is that it is broken up into 101 short “lessons”.
    Personally, I find long chapters difficult to get through when reading a book.
    The average lesson is only about 3 pages long – perfect for someone with a short
    attention span or little time for reading.

- en: It’s basically a mix of psychology, common sense, and actionable ideas to help
    traders of all kinds improve their trading. One section that may be of particular
    interest to readers of this blog is the last chapter that serves as an instruction
    manual on how to use Excel to download and test historical patterns. Dr. Steenbarger
    provides step by step instructions on building, filtering, and sorting the data
    to frame market hypotheses. He describes how to use the data to help generate
    ideas – not to just test already existing ideas. Most readers will find this one
    chapter contains more valuable information than most books.

    in Lessons 95 through 99\. Anyone who would like to download a copy of the spreadsheets
    may do so on the main Quantifiable Edges site.
