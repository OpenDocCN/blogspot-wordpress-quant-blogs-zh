- en: The trading and investment style of a fund manager often has a major impact
    on his trading costs. Practitioners recognize that trading schedules can be optimized
    over an alpha pattern, but without correct identification of the price impact
    of own trading activity, resulting schedules are suboptimal. We propose a framework
    to decompose the implementation shortfall cost of a realized trading schedule
    into a cost component due to the projected general market movement and trades
    of other market participants, and a cost component capturing the impact of own
