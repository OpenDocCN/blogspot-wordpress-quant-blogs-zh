    should be agnostic about political developments. Nevertheless, as we approach
    the election in the United States, it can be useful to reflect upon the political
    choices we all make. As an example, I recently came upon a Huffington Canada poll
    that illustrates the stark political difference between Americans and Canadians.

    of the answers was about how to divide the pie and not about how to increase the
    size of the pie. There was no discussion about fiscal policy (government deficits)
    or micro-economic policy, such as how to make the economy grow or to stimulate
    innovation, etc. There was none of the discussion about tax rates that has been
    a part of the discussion during this election season in the US.'

    despite the EU crisis, the looming recession, collapse of the Euro, etc. Their
    extensive safety net meant that there was not a ”Stressed Out Middle Class” or
    even a “Working Poor.” If you have health care, retirement, education, unemployment
    and day care paid for by the state — and a 70+% tax rate — you don’t sweat minor
    issues like continental recessions.

    locals about that tax rate. The national and local income tax, real estate taxes,
    state sales tax, and then the VAT tax mean that a 70% tax rate (versus gross income)
    was pretty typical. That seemed astonishingly high to me. But ***someone pointed
    out that once you add in the costs of health care, student loans, retirement investments,
    etc. — all the things state pay for with that 70% rate — an American making less
    than $100k ended up with about the same 30% net as the Finns do***.

    Americans and the citizens of major western countries is aspirational. Americans
    still believe in the American Dream. Even if they are poor, they crave policies
    that favor the well-off, even if it's to their detriment given their current conditions,
    because they aspire to move up the ladder. Canadians and Europeans, on the other
    hand, are more resigned (or realistic, depending on how you look at it) about
    their current conditions and have fewer aspirations to make it to the top.
