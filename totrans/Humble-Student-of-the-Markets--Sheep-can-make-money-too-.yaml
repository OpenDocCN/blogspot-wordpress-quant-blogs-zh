    were spread out among various futures contracts they often amounted to a few macro
    bets (i.e. on interest rates, on the US$, etc.) I came to the conclusion that
    these models were identifying macroeconomic trends that are persistent and exhibit
    serial correlation, which creates investment opportunities for patient long-term
    investors. For example, if the Fed is raising rates the odds are they will continue
    to raise rates until they signal a neutral or easing bias, i.e. there is a trend
    to interest rates, which is information that investors can use. The key risk in
    this class of models is knowing when to exit the trend, as short and long term
    reversals can be devastating to the bottom line.

    is where technical analysis is useful as it spots long term trends). The currency
    is reflective of investor concerns of the current account and fiscal deficits
    going out as far as the eye can see and no meaningful policies to reverse them.
    The recent Fed actions of rescuing the system from collapse have led to some to
    question the Central Bank’s inflation fighting credentials, which have resulted
    in additional Dollar weakness. In the short term, however, the US Dollar is near
    the bottom of its channel and seems to be poised for a counter-trend rally.
