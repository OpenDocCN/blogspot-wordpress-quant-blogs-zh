    Specifically, I pointed out that the Trend Model account achieved its returns
    when the US stock market had risen steadily in the last year with no major corrections.
    Pullbacks were brief and shallow.

    to commodity prices and global equity prices. Moreover, trend following models
    are notorious for subpar returns in trend-less markets which subject them to getting
    whipsawed in and out of positions. The chart below shows the actual (not back-tested)
    Trend Model signals and showed periods of whipsaw.

    In other words, it makes money when volatility expands (i.e. during trending moves).
    Conversely, it suffers frequent but small losses during non-trending periods in
    exchange for such infrequent but large gains. During non-trending periods the
    strategy attempts to tread water through the judicial use of stop loss orders
    until some market movement provides a large outlier move in which the strategy
    can profit.

    pullbacks are minor and stock market volatility, as measured by VIX, is low, but
    I wished to see it stress tested in a corrective period when volatility, as measured
    by VIX, is high? Given the market action in the past few days and the most recent
    Trend Model market call (see
