    socket. For weeks I have had this vague but excruciating pain, and saw various
    specialists, all useless. The pain just kept getting worse, causing my right triceps
    and lat to twitch like in the seminal experiments of Luigi Galvani using electricity
    to prod a frog gastrocnemius. A chiropractor thought that after an untold number
    of visits, the pain would disappear (''one leg is shorter than the other!'').
    After two weeks and no relief, I stopped going. Massage felt good at the time,
    but the pain or range of motion was unaffected. My various doctors basically gave
    me the ''back-shoulder pain'' google slap: try ice then heat, aspirin, Aleve,
    Ibuprofen, rest. Physical therapy was also pointless, various simple motions that
    did nothing. It was only after an MRI found the'

    taken in mega-doses: 800 to 1200 mg. Like trying to get drunk on one beer, the
    standard 2 ibuprofen (400 mg) doesn''t give you any relief. Taking 1000 mg 3 times
    daily has made a world of difference.'

    if you repeat their prescription, in the long run, the problem will be solved.
    In the long run, 'this too shall pass', and so everything will be fixed by time,
    in that you will either die, or the problem will go away on its own accord, but
    their ministrations are not part of that solution. And then, when going for the
    solution, you need to do it

    Modern drugs are basically created so that a 110 lb person who''s allergic to

    15 months, having to construct a case that affirms my right to use off-the-shelf
    programs that do mean-variance optimization, use insights from my PhD dissertation,
    or have to vet all my new ideas by Telluride Asset Management in perpetuity (with
    full rights of refusal, of course). Now a labral tear. What's next, boils? They
    should just send me to prison, and I could get free medical care, and recuperate
    via all the time I would have in my 6x12 cell doing PT. In a prior life, I must
    have pulled wings off butterflies.
