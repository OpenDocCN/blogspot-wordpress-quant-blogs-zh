    to rates their rates. Often, as accounts got riskier by going past due, the companies
    would increase the interest rate. Companies complained this was rational risk
    pricing. The government said it's gouging, taking advantage of people down on
    their luck.

    money, in order to shore up bank capital. So, the government has one group putting
