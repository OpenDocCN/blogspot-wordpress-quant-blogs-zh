## Defects, One Team, Responsibility

Scott over on LosTechies [offers](http://lostechies.com/scottreynolds/2009/01/07/creating-a-culture-of-responsibility/) an interesting read on Culture of Responsibility and Quality.

> You learn from measurement that defects are causing throughput to suffer inordinately, then you investigate the defects to determine the proper course of remediation.

With a few further call-outs for those who don’t want to read the full article:

*   Collaboration and open communication, to the point of transparency sometimes, is necessary to ensure that people feel safe taking responsibility – food for thought for all project managers and other senior folk on teams.
*   People live with the fear that a mistake could cost them their job is a symptom of a culture issue
*   Although obvious, “Encourage team members to spike ideas for a couple of days before hard decisions are made.”
*   The development team needs to know that they are a part of, not separate from, the organization as a whole – in many ways this is part of the silo mentality that is fuelled by seating locations, and other such mental dividers 😦
*   As a leader, it is your job to make sure the us/them wall gets broken down.

Food for thought
