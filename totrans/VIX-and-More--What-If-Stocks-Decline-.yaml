    of contingencies, so it stands to reason that they should even prepare themselves
    for the possibility of stocks actually declining one of these days...

    portfolio for that moment when equities once again feel the effects of gravity
    when I stumbled upon an interesting tool at [ETFreplay.com](http://etfreplay.com/)
    that they call their Down Day Association Stats. In a nutshell, it looks at the
    performance of a group of user-specified exchange-traded products on those days
    in which a benchmark falls X%.

    threshold decline and 36 months as my lookback period. I looked at 25 ETPs that
    cover a wide range of [asset classes](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/asset%20class)
    and investment approaches.

- en: Some of the results from the Down Day Association Stats are not particularly
    surprising. For instance, the long bond ([TLT](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TLT))
    and the dollar ([UUP](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/UUP)) have a
    strong negative correlation to stocks and generally perform well when SPY declines
    sharply. Some of the other bond choices ([LQD](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/LQD),
    [PCY](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/PCY), [BWX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/BWX))
    have been better at treading water than countertrending, but also show the benefits
    of diversification. The commodity choices were somewhat disappointing, generally
    managing to lose at best half as much as SPY, with crude oil almost matching the
    declines in the SPY to the penny.

    fared better than the SPY in big down days, while real estate ([IYR](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/IYR))
    fared worse.

- en: Of course every decline in stocks has a different set of catalysts and puts
    different stresses on different asset classes, sectors and geographies, but as
    stocks continue to grind higher, be sure to make preparations for that eventual
    pullback, because when it finally does arrive, it will likely do so at an inconvenient
    time and with surprising swiftness.
