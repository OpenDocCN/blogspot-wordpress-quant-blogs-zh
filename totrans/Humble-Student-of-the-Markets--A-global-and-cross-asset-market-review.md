# Humble Student of the Markets: A global and cross-asset market review

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2020/08/a-global-and-cross-asset-market-review.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2020/08/a-global-and-cross-asset-market-review.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models**

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post,

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The

**Trend Asset Allocation Model**

is an asset allocation model which applies trend following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or contraction (bearish)?"

My inner trader uses a

**trading model**

, which is a blend of price momentum (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa). Subscribers receive real-time alerts of model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of the those email alerts are updated weekly

. The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that began in March 2016 is shown below.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Sell equities*
*   Trend Model signal: Neutral*
*   Trading model: Bearish*

**An uneasy feeling**

I wrote a week ago that I had

[an uneasy feeling](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2020/08/02/an-uneasy-feeling/)

about the stock market's intermediate term outlook. This was owing to a combination of global market weakness, and cross-asset warning signals. Last week, US equities continued to grind upwards. Let's review how those signals evolved.

Starting with the US, the SPX broke up through a rising trend line to a new recovery high. Internals were mixed. While Advance-Decline Lines staged upside breakouts to all-time highs, the ratio of high beta to low volatility stocks, which is a risk appetite indicator was range-bound and did not confirm the market's strength. Neither the the NYSE Advance-Decline Volume (bottom panel).
