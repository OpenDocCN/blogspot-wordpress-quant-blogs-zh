    and focusing on implied volatility.  After all, implied volatility is the basis
    for the [VIX calculation](http://www.cboe.com/micro/vix/vixwhite.pdf) and historical
    volatility, well, for the most part I tend to regard it as a historical artifact
    that may or may not provide some insight into the current level of IV.

    interesting things to say about historical volatility in an [article published
    last week](http://www.tradingmarkets.com/.site/stocks/commentary/editorial/-69749.cfm)
    that bear repeating here.  In an article co-authored by [Larry Connors](http://www.tradingmarkets.com/.site/stocks/pros/connors/)
    (to my knowledge, the only person who has published a book [out of print, unfortunately]
    dedicated exclusively to the VIX: *[Trading Connors VIX Reversals](http://www.amazon.com/Trading-Connors-VIX-Reversals-Laurence/dp/1893756122/ref=sr_1_1/103-6386437-2275810?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1190903859&sr=8-1)*),
    TradingMarkets.com presents their research on 100 day historical volatility patterns
    and subsequent one year performance for 11,000+ stocks from the period 1995-2007.'

    looking at buckets of the 10% and 20% most volatile stocks and comparing these
    to buckets of the 10% and 20% least volatile stocks, the authors determined that
    the least volatile stocks were almost twice as likely to be trading higher one
    year later and, on average, had one year returns *more than double* (14.7% to
    7.3%) their high volatility counterparts.

    out that the lower volatility buckets outperformed the higher volatility group
    for the entire period studied, with the exception of the middle of 1998 through
    1999, during which time the dot com boom phenomenon overrode the tendency for
    the higher volatility stock to be the laggards.  Of course, if you were to remove
    this period from the study and focus on the remaining 11 years, the superior performance
    of the lower volatility stocks would be even more impressive than the statistics
    quoted above.

    make sure you put your profits into a low volatility long-term portfolio…and if
    the high volatility stocks start to outperform their slow and steady cousins,
    consider a defensive portfolio.  *[Bonus points to any reader who comes up with
    the best ratio chart available on StockCharts.com for comparing high volatility
    stocks to low volatility stocks.]*
