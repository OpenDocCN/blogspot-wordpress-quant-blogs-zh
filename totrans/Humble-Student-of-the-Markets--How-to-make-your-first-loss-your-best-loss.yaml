    process is when it does not perform well. After all, it is during periods of drawdown
    that the blemishes that appear in a model and no amount of backtesting will warn
    you of those shortcomings. If you are willing to learn from periods of underperformance,
    you can, in effect, make your first loss be your best loss. This is a case study
    of how I learned to diagnose a model`s shortcomings and learn from that experience.

    is based on the application of trend following techniques to global stock and
    commodity prices. The price volatility experienced for most of 2015 has led to
    an environment that is unfriendly to trend following models.

    since I started writing on this topic. One of the comments that I received is
    that the sample size of this study is absurdly low. I could extend the lookback
    period of the study using data for the Dow, which goes back to 1900, instead of
    the SP 500, which only goes back to 1950.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With that suggestion in mind, I reproduced the study using DJIA going back to
    1900\. Here is the R-squared chart. While the readings are slightly different
    from the SP 500 study, the longer time horizon revealed some interesting insights.
    First, the incidence of high 36-month R-squared readings was higher in the pre-1950
    period. Nevertheless, the current reading of 0.957 is comparable to the reading
    of 0.930 in pre-Crash 1987 and 0.911 in pre-Crash 1929\. Similarly, the spread
    between the 36-month and 6-month R-squared readings (bottom panel) is also at
    a similar order of magnitude when compared to 1987 and 1929.

    the minuscule N=4 in the SP 500 study that went back to 1950\. The market outperformed

    and very short-lived. Following occurrences in 1965, 1976, 1983, December 1993
    and 2007, the market’s upside “breakout” resulted in tops shortly afterward that
    would predominantly hold for the following year. Only the occurrences in 1951,
    1964 and 1995 saw the market persist at new highs for an extended period of time.

    term top could only be weeks away, buying weakness is the equivalent of picking
    up pennies in front of a steamroller. Selling strength when the market is overbought,
