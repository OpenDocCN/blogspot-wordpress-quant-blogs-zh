    to crank up the printing press for the sake of satisfying their domestic mandate. 
    One mechanism, perhaps the only mechanism, by which we can expect meaningful,
    sustained reversal from the current set of imbalances is via a significant depreciation
    of the dollar.  The rest of the world appears prepared to fight the Fed because
    they know no other path.

    2 now tear the system asunder. The collapse is coming via an unexpected channel;
    rather than originating from abroad, the shock that sets it in motion comes from
    the inside, a blast of stimulus from the US Federal Reserve. And at the moment,
    the collapse looks likely to turn disorderly quickly. If the Federal Reserve is
    committed to quantitative easing, there is no way for the rest of the world to
    stop to flow of dollars that is already emanating from the US. Yet much of the
    world does not want to accept the inevitable, and there appears to be no agreement
    on what comes next. Call me pessimistic, but right now I don't see how this situation
    gets anything but more ugly.

    Competitive devaluation is an inherently unstable system. Someone must lose their
    share of world trade. And a policy of boosting exports can all too easily turn
    into a policy of blocking imports.
