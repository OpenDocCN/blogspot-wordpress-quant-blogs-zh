    that Barclays launched the launched the ETN+ S&P VEQTOR ETN ([VQT](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VQT))
    yesterday. Flying mostly under the radar, this ETN traded only 300 shares in its
    first day. That being said, I think VQT is probably the most interesting volatility
    product launched to date, with dynamic hedging rules that make it the first [actively
    managed](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/actively%20managed%20ETFs)
    off-the-shelf volatility product for the retail investor.

- en: I promise a more detailed analysis of VQT in the near future, but for now suffice
    it to say that the ETN essentially consists of a long position in the S&P 500
    index, hedged with a volatility position ([VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX))
    that varies daily, based on how the ETN evaluates volatility risk, largely using
    [realized volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/realized%20volatility)
    and [implied volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/implied%20volatility)
    calculations. The table below shows that the two main inputs into determining
    the VXX allocation are the current level of realized volatility and the direction
    of the implied volatility trend. The equity component of VQT is set to vary in
    a range of 60-97.5%, with the volatility component comprising the balance of the
    VQT at anywhere from 2.5-40%.

- en: The concept behind VQT is an extremely attractive one, as it includes some built-in
    disaster insurance in the form not just of a volatility hedge, but also a stop
    loss feature, which is triggered whenever the 5-day return of the [VEQTOR](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VEQTOR)
    index on which VQT is based is equal to or less than -2.0%.

    which I will take up in subsequent posts. In the meantime, readers are encouraged
    to study the [pricing supplement](https://ecommerce.barcap.com/investorsolutions/contentStore.app?id=185332)
    for VQT.

    product from [Direxion](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Direxion)
    that I discussed a little over a month ago in [Direxion and S&P Bring Dynamic
    Volatility Hedging to ETFs with VEQTOR](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/07/veqtor-brings-dynamic-volatility.html).
