# Quantifiable Edges: Last Week's Equity Put/Call Ratios Suggest A Pullback

> 来源：[http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2009/09/last-weeks-equity-putcall-ratios.html#0001-01-01](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2009/09/last-weeks-equity-putcall-ratios.html#0001-01-01)

The CBOE Equity put/call ratio was consistently low last week. The 5-day average is 0.53, which is nearly 22% below the 200-day average of 0.68\. When the 5-day average gets extremely low as it is now that can lead to a short-term market pullback. Below is a study that exemplifies this.

Most notable and also most compelling about this study is the fact that all instances have occurred after the March bottom. Prior to that the 5-day ratio had never stretched 20% below the 200-day. This is another example of just how extreme the current bull move has become. It also makes the results that much more impressive from a negative standpoint since they were achieved during a 60% run-up in the market.
