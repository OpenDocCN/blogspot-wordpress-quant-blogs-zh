    relativity, which introduced the idea that the speed of light was constant, could
    explain this anomaly (and the anomaly implied with Maxwell's equations on a similar
    point). The heat of the earth was an anomaly, because Lord Kelvin

    of nuclear fission in the earth's core. When Alexander Fleming saw that penicillin
    spores caused his petri dishes of bacteria to have little dead spots, that was
    a puzzle.

- en: OK, what's the trick? Basically, extreme but improbable events, for both inflation
    and stock market moves. All it takes is to put in a large, one in a hundred year
    adverse event, and these anomalies are rationalized. Of course, with data of only
    one hundred years, we often don't realize these events, but that proves nothing.
    They could happen, and indeed if we look cross sectionally at other countries,
    they do (eg, Russia, Japan, Poland, Germany).

- en: My criticism of this approach is that it leaves many of the puzzles unaffected.
    For example, if this explains the equity premium, why is it when you create a
    synthetic equity position by going long 1.5 beta stocks, and short 0.5 beta stocks,
    you have a negative expected return? Why does the small chance of large inflation
    explain the overnight to 2 year yield spread, but not the flatness of the curve
    from 2 to 30 years? I don't think a solution incompatible with these data is correct.
