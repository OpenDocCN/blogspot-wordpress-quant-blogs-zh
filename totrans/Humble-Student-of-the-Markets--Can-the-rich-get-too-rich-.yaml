- en: recently posted about a blind spot in how China is dealing with income inequality.
    He quoted an anonymous author who is an economist at a Chinese university warning
    that resentment is rising, not because of income inequality, but the lack of opportunity.
    There seems to be a general perception that there is one set of rules for the
    privileged and another for everyone else.

    is dealing with the issue is all wrong. They are relying on local officials to
    police the problem when the local officals ARE the problem (i.e. privilege).

    (municipal police, who often serve as bully-boys and bribe-collectors for local
    officials) knows that [nearly identical incidents](http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1899773,00.html)
    – sometimes, but not always, minus the gruesome ending — take place on a daily
    basis all across China (the above link to a 2009 TIME magazine article by Austin
    Ramzy is well worth reading, and comparing to the Tunisian incident).

    along with many commentators, are misdiagnosing the source of people’s resentment
    over inequality — and that giving party bureaucrats a more active role in managing
    the economy will make the problem worse, not better.

    sort of bullying happens (i.e. beatings, etc.) when you don't care about what
    happens to the lower classes and you don't think that their opinion matters. Long
    term, these attitudes inhibit economic dynamism (what would America be without
    the American Dream of social mobility?) and social tensions.
