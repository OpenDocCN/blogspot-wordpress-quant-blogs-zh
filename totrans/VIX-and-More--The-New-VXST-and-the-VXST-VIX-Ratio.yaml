    the CBOE Risk Management Conference in Portugal. One which particularly caught
    my interest was the [announcement](http://ir.cboe.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=794060)
    of the launch of the new CBOE Short-Term Volatility Index ([VXST](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXST)),
    which is essentially identical to the VIX, except that whereas the VIX is looking
    ahead at a window of 30 calendar days, the VXST measures [implied volatility](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implied_volatility)
    of options on the [S&P 500 index](http://www2.standardandpoors.com/portal/site/sp/en/us/page.topic/indices_500/2,3,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.html)
    (SPX) for the next 9 calendar days.

    on the index and the [VIX:VXV ratio](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%3AVXV)
    I pioneered as an indicator back in December 2007\. With the new VXST, investors
    now have a better gauge of volatility expectations to apply to time frames that
    are appropriate for [weekly options](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/weeklys),
    which are on track to account for about 25% of all options trades by the end of
    the year.

- en: The launch of VXST options opens up a whole new set of possibilities, not the
    least of which is a [VXST:VIX ratio](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXST%3AVIX)
    that offers some possibilities as an indicator that are similar to those of the
    VIX:VXV ratio. In the chart below, I have mapped not the ratio of VXST:VIX, but
    the differential between the two indices. With VXST historical data going back
    to the beginning of 2011, it is worth noting that the VIX has been higher than
    VXST about 61% of the time. Typically, when volatility spikes, VXST spikes much
    higher than the VIX, with the bulk of the 39% of the instances in which VXST is
    higher than VIX occurring mostly during periods of elevated volatility.

    point. For now it is worth noting that these ratios have some advantage to comparing
    the [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures) [term
    structure](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/term%20structure) in that
    the indices focus on a fixed time period, while the days to expiration of the
    VIX futures is constantly in flux.

    and futures might be even more attractive to certain types of traders. Also, if
    VXST futures gain some traction, I can envision ETPs based on these that might
    rival the interest in VXX at some point.

    space.
