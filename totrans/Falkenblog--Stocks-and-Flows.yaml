    and raises taxes by $3 billion a year in order to amortize the bonds. Government
    purchases go up by $100 billion this year. Private consumption goes down by $3
    billion this year. Net fiscal impetus is not $0 but rather $97 billion. Cochrane
    doesn't understand the Ricardian Equivalence argument he is trying to make.

    $97B was created via this spending and taxes this year, which is why they love
    government spending regardless of what it is spent upon. But if they issued $100B
    in bonds to create this ''new demand'', where would that $100B have have gone
    otherwise? I don''t think this makes sense in general equilibrium; money is never
    ''idle'' unless it is under your mattress. I guess if you could caricature the
    two views: one thinks supply creates its own demand, the other that demand creates
    its own supply.'
