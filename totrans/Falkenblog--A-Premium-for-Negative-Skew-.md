# Falkenblog: A Premium for Negative Skew?

Xiong, Idzorek, and Ibbotson have a

[new paper](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2274295)

coming out in the JPM showing that

*mutual funds*

with the highest tail risk (ie, highest probability of extreme downside returns) have higher returns. That is, there's a positive risk premium to negative skew. This is rather curious.

The only thing I saw in this field related to this found the opposite. That is, in a 2006 JoF paper,

[Kosowski, Timmermann, and Wermers, and White](http://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/faculty/rwermers/ktww.pdf)

bootstrapped the alphas of the entire universe of U.S. domestic equity

*mutual funds*

, and found that the top decile had much more positive skewness than the median. The bottom decile had more negative skewness.

 I don't have the data, but it can't be consistent with both findings.
