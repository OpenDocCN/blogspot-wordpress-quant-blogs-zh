# Complexity – Large-Scale Software Systems | Tales from a Trading Desk

## Complexity – Large-Scale Software Systems

“Out of the Tar Pit” is an old [paper](http://shaffner.us/cs/papers/tarpit.pdf), but worth a read never the less.  The paper was picked up in more recent years by [Hacker](https://www.hackerschool.com/blog/51-paper-of-the-week-out-of-the-tar-pit) School, and also “10 Technical [Papers](http://blog.fogus.me/2011/09/08/10-technical-papers-every-programmer-should-read-at-least-twice/) Every Programmer Should Read (At Least Twice), and more recently, Brian [Gesiak](http://modocache.svbtle.com/thoughts-on-out-of-the-tar-pit).

Since Brian has offered a few interesting call-outs already, I’ll only offer a few additional thoughts/quotes:

> Page 1: The biggest problem in the development and maintenance of large-scale software systems is com- plexity — large systems are hard to understand

> Page 2: Complexity is the root cause of the vast majority of problems with soft- ware today

Page 10, Complexity caused by Code Volume:

> “Many of the classic problems of developing software products derive from this essential complexity and its nonlinear increase with size”

Net out, try and keep systems simple to avoid a complexity death spiral
