- en: While the final numbers were good and the SPY left an unfilled upside gap, some
    traders may have been disappointed yesterday that the SPY finished in the lower
    part of its daily range. Historically, unfilled gaps and 20-day intraday highs
    as was put in on Tuesday have been followed by much more positive action when
    the rally closed meekly. Tuesday's action actually appears bullish. This is something
    I examined just last week in the 1/4/12 Subscriber Letter. Below is an excerpt
    from that letter.

  zh: 尽管最终数字不错，SPY留下了未填补的上行缺口，但一些交易员可能昨天失望地发现SPY在其日间波动范围的较低部分收盘。历史上，像周二那样留下未填补的缺口和20日内的日内高点通常在反弹温和收盘后会出现更积极的表现。周二的市场动作实际上看起来是看涨的。这件事我上周在1/4/12的订阅信中刚刚探讨过。以下是那封信的摘录。
- en: '*I ran a test of performance following unfilled upside gaps that make a 20-day
    high. Below I’ve broken out the results by times the SPY closed above the open
    versus times where it closed below the open.**First let’s look at those times
    where the finish was relatively strong:**There doesn’t appear to be any edge in
    either direction here. Now let’s examine times like the present where SPY closed
    below the open.*'

  zh: '*我对跟随未填补的上行缺口进行了一个测试，这些缺口形成了20日高点。下面我将结果按照SPY收盘价高于开盘价的时间与收盘价低于开盘价的时间进行分类。**首先让我们看看收盘相对强势的情况：**这里似乎没有明显的方向优势。现在让我们检查像现在这样SPY收盘价低于开盘价的情况。*'
- en: '*These results are substantially better than earlier where the finish was good.
    Rather than worrying about the weak finish bulls should be excited by it.*'
