- en: In the four years or so I have been using blogs as one of my core investment
    resources, only a handful of these blogs have consistently offered up high quality
    information and analysis. At the top of that list is probably Dr. Brett Steenbarger’s
    [TraderFeed](http://traderfeed.blogspot.com/), which has specialized in trader
    [psychology](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/psychology), where it
    has been the destination blog for this subject since its launch. Unfortunately,
    TraderFeed will no longer see any new posts, as Dr. Brett has made a career change
    which has resulted in the a cessation of new material on the blog. Fortunately,
    however, TraderFeed will live on as an archive of some 3700+ posts.

    psychology, market sentiment, technical analysis and related subjects, deftly
    researched and written, all tied together with a fountain of original ideas. Back
    in the days when I used to periodically assemble my [linkfest](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/links)
    posts, it seemed almost impossible to cherry pick from the best of the blogosphere
    without including at least one post from Dr. Brett, as the links below can attest
    to.

- en: The archives notwithstanding, the end of TraderFeed leaves a large hole in the
    blogging world. I have enjoyed others who have written extensively on trader psychology,
    including Denise Shull at [Trader Psyches](http://traderpsyches.com/ideas/blog),
    but the departure of TraderFeed also provides me with an excuse to work more of
    my thinking about trader psychology into this blog. So whereas I still have many
    thousands of posts on the VIX and volatility kicking around in my head, I will
    also consider this development as an opportunity to explore some of the “[…and
    More](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/and%20More)” side of this blog.

    had a feature interview with Brett Steenbarger just before the decision was made
    to put TraderFeed on hold. Look for Mark Wolfinger's conversation with Brett in
    the May edition of Expiring Monthly, which will be published on the Monday following
    the current options expiration cycle, May 24.
