- en: Back in early December, in [Breaking Down the Financial Sector Post-Lehman](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/12/breaking-down-financial-sector-post.html),
    I contrasted the broad-based KBW Bank Index ETF ([KBE](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/KBE))
    with several other KBW financial sector ETFs, notably [KRE](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=KRE)
    (KBW regional banking index), [KCE](http://finance.yahoo.com/q/pr?s=KCE) (KBW
    capital markets index) and [KIE](http://finance.yahoo.com/q/pr?s=KIE) (KBW insurance
    index.) At that time, the regional banking index was holding up better than its
    siblings, but had begun to show some weakness.

    of the same quartet of ETFs since the November 21^(st) bottom (SPX 741), when
    things probably looked darkest for the financial sector.

    [MS](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/MS), [CME](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/CME),
    [SCHW](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SCHW) and [STT](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/STT))
    is sporting gains of over 20% since this period, while insurance stocks are almost
    back to breaking even and both banking ETFs, the regional and money center variants,
    have been bring up the rear, moving almost in lockstep as of late and showing
    losses in excess of 25% for the period in question. All four groups have bounced
    impressively off of the March lows, but once again, it is the capital markets
    group that has showed the most strength, with State Street (STT) leading the way.
