- en: Last Thursday, a very non-typical hourly saw-tooth pattern emerged in several
    stocks. By the time we saw this mid-day, we were intrigued, with some message
    boards noting it. I don't know the provenance of this pattern, but suspect it
    was a poorly designed algorithm that was trying to buy some fixed amount at the
    hour until completion, and did this repetitively over the day in some newfangled
    VWAP attempt. It looks like it shot out stupid buy orders for the first 30 minutes
    of each hour.

    stop your stupid program and tweak it.

    random.
