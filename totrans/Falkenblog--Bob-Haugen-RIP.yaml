    going on in the stock market. He looked at 40 or so specific metrics related to
    liquidity, price ratios, prior returns, growth, and risk, and found many of them
    significantly related to future returns in the US, Germany, France, and the UK.

    influential paper showing the value and size anomalies, and reconciled this within
    a risk model that they said must have some orthogonal value and size related factors.

- en: (1991, with Nardin Baker). This paper highlighted that a very fundamental portfolio,
    the Minimum Variance Portfolio that is at the extreme left of a convex hull created
    via Markowitzian diversification in mean-variance space, actually had a slightly
    higher than average return.  Haugen focused on the inefficiency of the market
    portfolio, but I used it to support my contention that low volatility stocks actually
    had slightly higher than average returns.  Most low volatility funds reference
    this paper in presentations of their approach, as it was the first paper to highlight
    the dominance of this special portfolio.
