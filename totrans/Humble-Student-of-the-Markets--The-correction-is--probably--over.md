# Humble Student of the Markets: The correction is (probably) over

**Mid-week market update:**

About two weeks ago, my inner trader turned cautious on the US stock market (see my

and subsequent post 

[Tactically taking profits in the commodity and reflation trade](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/05/11/tactically-taking-profits-in-the-commodity-and-reflation-trade/)

). I had cited as reasons the weakness from China, the commodity markets and, later, Europe (see

[Waiting for the storm to pass](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/05/15/waiting-for-the-storm-to-pass/)

), which was based on inter-market and cross-asset analysis. (Though my inner investor remained constructive on stocks.)

Since then, the SPX weakened to test an important technical support at 2040, which represents the neckline of a potential head and shoulders formation. (As all good technicians know, a head and shoulders formation isn't complete until the neckline is broken.) While the market did break 2040 last week on an intra-day basis, neckline support held. In addition, the NASDAQ Composite confirmed the strength today by staging an upside breakout through resistance.

At the time of the bearish trading call, I said that I would turn bullish if:

*   The US stock market got oversold and sentiment models flashed a crowded short reading; o
*   The stock markets improved in Europe or Asia.

Let's consider what has happened since then.
