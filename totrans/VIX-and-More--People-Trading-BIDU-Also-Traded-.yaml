- en: Back in September 2007, I started periodically posting snapshots from the optionsXpress
    [Trading Patterns](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Trading%20Patterns)
    feature and chose to highlight the highly speculative Chinese internet search
    firm, Baidu ([BIDU](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/BIDU)), then trading
    at 299, as my guinea pig. Over the course of seven months, I twice updated what
    traders who traded BIDU were also trading at optionsXpress when BIDU was [at 380
    on 10/30/2007](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/10/update-on-people-trading-bidu-also.html)
    and when it was [at 350 on 4/22/2008](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/04/bidu-speculators.html).

    who are trading BIDU (currently at 185) are still active in the most volatile
    names in agriculture, financials, shipping, solar, and casinos. The stocks on
    the top ten list: Potash ([POT](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/POT)),
    Mosaic ([MOS](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/MOS)), Citigroup ([C](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/C)),
    JPMorgan Chase ([JPM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/JPM)), Bank
    of America ([BAC](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/BAC)), DryShips
    ([DRYS](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/DRYS)), First Solar ([FSLR](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/FSLR)),
    and Las Vegas Sands ([LVS](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/LVS)).
    Also on the list are two ETFs, [QQQQ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/QQQQ)
    and [SPY](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SPY). Either optionsXpress
    customers have been cleaning up on the short side or they are a little early to
    the bull party.'
