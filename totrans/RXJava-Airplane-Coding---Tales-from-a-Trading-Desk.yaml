    Most of the coding was around enhanced [scenario](http://cukes.info/) testing
    and refactoring the underlying codebase to further leverage [RxJava](https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava). 
    Ran into a curious “box type” cucumber error, which due to not having download
    the full documentation pre-flight, was luckily resolved via a spelling correct
    in the .feature file.

    allowed me to combine two observables, but I’ve now realised that that isn’t exactly
    what I want to do.  I really want a “select” across two Observables – still pondering
    on that one.
