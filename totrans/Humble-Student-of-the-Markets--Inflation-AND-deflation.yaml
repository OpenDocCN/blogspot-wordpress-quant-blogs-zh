    I am more concerned with the next recession than this one. Recent history suggests
    that each recession necessitates lower interest rates than the last. I would prefer
    to pull the economy up to a point where we had some distance from the zero bound
    such that we did not have revert back to managing economic activity via ballooning
    the balance sheet. And while the balance sheet proved to be an effective tool
    for defrosting frozen financial markets, would it be as effective if the next
    time around the problem was simply too little demand in the presence of functioning
    financial markets? I would rather not endure the experiment.'

    in synchronized prime pumping policies that amount to competitive devaluation.
    However, because the stimulus is more or less synchronized, devaluation pressures
    aren’t showing up in the forex markets but in the commodity markets. So when central
    bankers analyze core inflation statistics, which is ex-food and energy, or trimmed
    mean inflation-like statistics, commodity inflation doesn’t show up because that
    the precise segment that’s getting excluded.

    what the consensus is. I would add that the risk of inflation, in particular commodity
    inflation, is also higher than anyone expects.
