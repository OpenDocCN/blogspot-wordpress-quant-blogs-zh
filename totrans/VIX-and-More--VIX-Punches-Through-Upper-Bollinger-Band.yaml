    and has no way of knowing whether the markets are underestimating or overestimating
    the full extent of the [European sovereign debt crisis](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/European%20sovereign%20debt%20crisis),
    not only in the Emerald Isle, but also in [Greece](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Greece)
    and [Portugal](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Portugal).

    and economic flash points, most VIX traders prefer to take a technically-based
    approach to trading volatility. In this vein, the simplest and most effective
    approach is to fade any VIX extremes. I have covered many ways to measure VIX
    extremes in this blog. One of the simplest is to use [Bollinger bands](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Bollinger%20bands)
    to identify VIX values which are extreme enough to invite high probability [mean
    reversion](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/mean%20reversion) trades.

    band settings (20 days, 2.0 standard deviations), showing that the recent VIX
    high of 23.06 is well above the 22.45 upper band level of the current Bollinger
    band settings. For most VIX traders, this means a short VIX play is in order,
    irrespective of events on the ground in Europe.

    have a habit of clustering and creating a vicious cycle. One only has to scroll
    back six months to see what happened the last time concern about European sovereign
    debt soared, sending the VIX from 15 to 48 in the space of a month.
