    answer, of course, is that nobody knows.  For the most part, panic and fear are
    not fleeting emotions.'

    located in southern <country-region st="on"><place st="on">Peru</place></country-region>.  The
    canyon is twice as deep as its more famous relative, the [Grand Canyon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Canyon).  What
    I find particularly interesting about <place st="on"><placename st="on">Colca</placename>
    <placetype st="on">Canyon</placetype></place> is that despite a vertical drop
    of over 10,000 feet, much of the canyon is terraced and relatively flat.

    charts that I refer to from time to time is a ratio chart of the percentage of
    S&P500 stocks above their 50 day SMA divided by the VIX.  It is a rough approximation
    of greed ÷ fear and prints some interesting extreme numbers from time to time,
    particularly for market bottoms.  Because the values of this ratio chart are one
    ratio divided by another, it is possible to compare values over time and get meaningful
    results.

    out is the toppy readings (6.0 – 8.0) that persisted over the past six months
    or so, as compared to the previous high readings, which tended to last only a
    month or two.

    know that the moves in the VIX over the past week have been unprecedented, but
    what the chart indicates is that given the steepness of the decline and the current
    low reading of 1.55, the ratio is not likely to deteriorate much further, if at
    all.  Don’t expect the ratio to stay in the <place st="on"><placename st="on">Colca</placename>
    <placetype st="on">Canyon</placetype></place> area – or even below 3 – for much
    longer.

    go out on a limb to say that the worst of it is likely behind us and that further
    declines, if any, should be a lot more orderly.
