    around the world a few times due to my inability to actually finish read it, I’m
    happy to say I’m now in a position to post my thoughts.  Overall, after reading
    Benevolent Dictator I found myself agreeing almost everything in the book, and
    wanting to meet [Michael Feuer](http://www.benevolentdictator.biz/?page_id=2)
    and dig further into certain “Lessons”.  Hence, I can only recommend this book
    as a must read for anyone considering a start-up, or anyone wanting to assess
    the company they work for.  Usual style comments follow:'
