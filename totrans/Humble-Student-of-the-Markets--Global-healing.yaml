    Banking Index shows a pattern of a rally through a relative downtrend. The ECB's
    LTRO program of providing unlimited liquidity for up to three years to eurozone
    banks has bought the politicians time and created the perception of a Draghi Put
    for the market. The recent relative performance of the BKX, which is heavily weighted
    with the large TBTF banks, is reflective of this relief.

    the +500 level but still below the peak of +763 seen on Nov. 15, 2011\. So it
    is a divergent lower high, but it is still high enough to say that the uptrend
    which started in October 2011 is not over. There can be ordinary pullbacks along
    the way, but the message of the RASI is that the final highs of this current new
    uptrend have not yet been seen.
