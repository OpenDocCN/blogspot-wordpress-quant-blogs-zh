    which documented the silent implosion of Zhongdan Investment Credit Guarantee

    Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) get access to bank loans. State-run banks
    are often reluctant to lend to private companies that do not have the hard assets
    (such as land) or implicit government backing that State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs)
    enjoy. Local governments encouraged the formation of a new kind of financial entity,
    which would charge prospective borrowers a fee and, in exchange, serve as a guarantor
    to the bank, pledging to pay for any losses in the event of a default. Having
    transferred the risk onto someone else’s shoulders, the bank could rest easy and
    issue the loan (which it otherwise would have been reluctant to make). In effect,
    the “credit guarantee” company had sold insurance — otherwise known as a credit
    default swap (CDS) — to the bank for a risky loan, with the borrower forking over
    the premium.
