- en: After a recent visit to China, Nobuyuki Saji, chief economist and equity strategist
    for Japanese investment bank Mitsubishi UFJ Securities, issued a report warning
    that China could be on the verge of pushing the world into a deflationary spiral.
    The problem? Swelling industrial overcapacity, which threatens to undermine prices
    both for China's exported goods and its imports of raw materials.

    capacity, as many industries that have been expanding rapidly are now being hit
    by slowing demand both domestically and abroad. Based on his estimates, China
    alone represents 7 per cent of the global supply/demand gap.

    Chinese overcapacity story, if it becomes widespread, could be the catalyst for
    the next downleg. It would serve to take US and European stocks down further.
    It would also be extremely negative for commodities of all types, as the hopes
    of commodity demand from future Chinese infrastructure investment would evaporate.

    formation, it suggests that the news is already discounted in the market. After

    we in the trade? (My Asian based readers are invited to comment).

    overcapacity story becomes widespread and hits the pages of US newspapers. That
    would serve to prompt the final capitulation that washes out the last weak and
    desperate holders of equities to sell out and form the basis for a new bull market.
