- en: 'On Tuesday the low put/call ratio and the reaction to the Fed suggested a pullback
    was likely to occur soon. Wednesday the volume pattern made the same suggestion.
    Thursday the market dropped hard. The S&P and Dow both lost almost 2%. The Nasdaq
    just under 1%. There’s no telling whether this drop will continue over the next

    semiconductors take on a leadership role, it’s normally a good thing for the market.

- en: Not only are the % wins and average trade columns notable here but the massive
    volatility as well. Look at the size of the average wins and losses when you go
    out 4-6 weeks. Even over the next two weeks they’re huge. If you’re bullish, the
    stats are compelling. If your unsure, then a volatility play might be something
    to consider.
