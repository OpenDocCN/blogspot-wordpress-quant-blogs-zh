# “As a developer..” I forget about Retrospectives | Tales from a Trading Desk

## “As a developer..” I forget about Retrospectives

Unfortunately, another default Scrum ceremony that is often ignored is the [retrospective](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/sprint-retrospective).  Without retrospectives the team can’t learn and improve.  Rally lists the retrospective [issue](https://help.rallydev.com/top-10-mistakes-teams) in its “Top 10 Mistakes Made by New Agile Teams”.  In my humble view the failure of a team to engage in a retrospective says a lot about the team failing to be/understand agile – the team could often be said to be simply going though some motions of pretending to be agile, without actually understanding and embracing agile.

Suggestion: Buy one of the many good agile book and learn.  Read the blogs from the many respected agile coaches.  Embrace the new world and stop blocking others.
