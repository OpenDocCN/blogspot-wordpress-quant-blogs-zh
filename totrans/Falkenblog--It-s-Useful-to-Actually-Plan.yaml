- en: Charles' Murray's Losing Ground was that most incentives in life are negative,
    in that if you don't do X you will starve or freeze or whatever. Thus, you learn
    to be thrifty, nice, and hard working to simply get by. The most common complaint
    by businesses as to why they fail is that their  banker stopped lending or seized
    their collateral; if they just had more time things would have turned around.

    liabilities, and if you simply plan based on cash flow--including borrowing--you
    will hit your constraint with probability=1\. Bankruptcy seems to be the only
    realistic constraint.

    on the city council. '**We didn't have projections** into the future what the
    costs might be…I learned that you don't make decisions without looking into the
    future'… 'Nobody gave thought to how it was eventually going to be paid for,'
    says Mr. Deis, the city manager.
