    but rather than try and justify it away I decided to look at other times where
    the Nasdaq Volume Spyx came in extremely low. I set the parameters at -5 or below
    to get a decent sample size:'

    fact that of the 26 occurrences, every single one of them posted a close below
    the trigger day close within 3 trading days. If the perfect record is to hold
    up, the Nasdaq will have to post a close below 1564.32 by Wednesday.
