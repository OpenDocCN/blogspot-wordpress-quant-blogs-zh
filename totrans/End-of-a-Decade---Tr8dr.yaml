    in on Wall Street. ¬† But that would belie the observation that the 80s, and the
    90s also came with dramatic changes to the markets and for practitioners.

- en: I was not on the street during the 80s, but the 80s were really the start of
    the acceleration point towards model and technology driven trading. ¬† The 70s
    brought us the famous Black-Scholes model, the 80s a variety of synthetic instruments
    such as swaps, swaptions, CMOs, etc. ¬† ¬†The 80s really had not fully ushered in
    the leveraging of technology as it would do in the 90s and the ultimate step-up
    in the 2000‚Äôs.

    option modeling. ¬† The 90s saw the rise of quantitative modeling and financial
    application of technology unlike any time previous. ¬† To be a quant or quantitative
    developer in those days was exciting and rewarding.

    about 10 years old at that point still were traded on the back of HP calculators
    or maybe lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheets. ¬† The spreads were wide, in the 10s of basis
    points, today in fractional basis points.

    before we saw an explosion in complexity in exotic derivatives. ¬† Over time many
    of these exotics would become mainstream ‚Äúvanilla‚Äù products. ¬† The interest rate
    markets moved in the direction of more volume in vanillas and more complexity
    in exotics.

    interestingly were ‚Äúquietly‚Äù building out increasing sophistication on the ‚Äúprogram
    trading‚Äù front (as it was called in those days). ¬† This was mostly unique to the
    equities markets, whereas the interest rate and FX markets continued to be largely
    OTC.

    ¬†The NYSE introduced DOT in the 80s as a means to provide automated clearing and
    semi-automated execution (order routing) to the manned floor.
  prefs: []

- en: Program trading facilitated basic execution algo, index arbitrage, and proprietary
    strategies. ¬† ¬†Index arbitrage involved buying or selling index futures against
    executing a basket of the same or similar components. ¬† ¬†The game then as it is
    now was speed.

- en: In some of the foreign equity markets electronic execution was prohibited, throttled,
    or limited in various ways. ¬† For instance I remember that the Japanese MOF would
    not allow electronic execution to the exchange or at least required keying of
    orders by humans placed in Osaka, perhaps partially to protect such jobs, but
    maybe also to protect companies with less sophistication.

    lines from such terminals so as to simulate typing orders. ¬† Technically they
    employed people at the exchange to lend some credibility to the idea that they
    were following the rules, but was pretty much common knowledge that this was going
    on. ¬† They just happened to have very fast typists üòâ

    or market maker are numbered. ¬† A raft of traders are being replaced by teams
    of quant / traders, usually more on the quant / CS side than time spent in trading.

    strategies and a much smaller number of ‚Äúexecution traders‚Äù that manage the strategies
    day to day. ¬† ¬†Now *that* is really exciting, but perhaps shows my bias being
    in the former group.

    will push for more commoditization, automated clearing, and eventual exchanges.
    ¬† The new areas of innovation in the medium term for derivatives need to be in
    risk management IMO.
