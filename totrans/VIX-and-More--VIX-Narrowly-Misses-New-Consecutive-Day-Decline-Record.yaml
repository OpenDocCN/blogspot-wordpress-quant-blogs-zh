    setting a new record today when it jumped 0.37 in the 4:00 - 4:15 p.m. ET [twilight
    zone](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/twilight%20zone) trading period
    to finish the day at 21.49, +0.06.

    I offer some data to help put the current decline in an appropriate historical
    context. Prior to the streak that ended last Friday, the only other time that
    the VIX fell for ten consecutive days was in April to May of 2005\. At that time,
    the bull market was just beginning to pause for a month and it was not until six
    months later that bulls began to reassert themselves.

    days in a row, a pattern emerges in which following the VIX streak, the S&P 500
    index has a tendency to post a slight loss for a week or so, then significantly
    outperform the historical averages (“census”) for the balance of the periods studied,
    from 10 to 100 trading days.

- en: In terms of adding an interpretive narrative, think of a streak of the VIX declining
    for seven or more days in a row as a signal that the markets are recalibrating
    volatility expectations and paving the way for further advances in an environment
    of diminished risk. Of course the caveat is that a week or so of mean reversion
    (i.e., an increasing VIX and a declining SPX) usually serves as a transition from
    the streak of VIX declines to an extended period of above-average stock market
    returns.
