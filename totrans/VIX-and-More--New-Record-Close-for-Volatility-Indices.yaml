- en: Today’s dramatic last hour selloff resulted in new record high closes in four
    of the seven major U.S. volatility indices, including the VIX, which exceeded
    60 for the first time and established a new record close of 63.92\. In addition
    to the VIX, the [VXD](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXD) (CBOE DJIA
    Volatility Index) and the [RVX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/RVX)
    (CBOE Russell 2000 Volatility Index) also set new records.

- en: Note that these volatility indices have different life spans and data histories,
    so the comparisons of all-time record highs across indices are not always particularly
    relevant. For more information on all of the volatility indices, try [Overview
    of U.S. Volatility Indices](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/08/overview-of-us-volatility-indices.html).
