    Trading Models](http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/59122), utilize a regime switching
    signal based upon *time delay embedding*. The intuition underlying this signal
    and use for [regime discovery](https://quantivity.wordpress.com/2010/02/15/regime-discovery/)
    are unexpectedly interesting.

    framed within the context of a *two-state switching regime* (interpreted in the
    classic technical sense): “momentum” or “mean reversion”. With high frequency
    equities portfolio data, they informally observe the familiar *volatility-regime
    correlation*: high volatility implies momentum (*e.g.* herd effects), low volatility
    implies mean reversion (*e.g.* market making).'

    dimension ![H ](img/476b7639b127a2941791628e4786c510.png). Such is presumably
    left as an exercise for the reader, as selecting optimal embedding dimension is
    indeed well-known to be one of the most significant challenges in reconstruction.
