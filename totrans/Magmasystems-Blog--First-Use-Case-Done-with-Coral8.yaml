- en: I now have Coral8 detecting when a sector has abnormal activity, and I have
    a Coral8 Output Stream publishing into a .NET application for visualization. If
    I want to, I can take the data from the Coral8 alert, transform it into a JMS
    message, and publish it out on the Tibco EMS bus for other applications in the
    organization to consume. Or, I can publish it out to another Coral8 stream.

- en: Now, it's on to the Aleri evaluation. The good people at Aleri's sales engineering
    team have done most of this first use case, but now that I am armed with more
    Coral8 knowledge, I need to try to rebuild the Aleri use case from scratch by
    myself.
