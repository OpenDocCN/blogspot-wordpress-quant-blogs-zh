# VIX and More: Guest Columnist for Steven Sears at Barron’s

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/11/guest-columnist-for-steven-sears-at.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/11/guest-columnist-for-steven-sears-at.html#0001-01-01)

It may just be a coincidence, but each time I have been tapped as a guest columnist for *The Striking Price* on behalf of Steven Sears at [Barron’s](http://online.barrons.com/), there has been a spike in volatility just as I sit down to draft some thoughts. Perhaps Steven knows something I don’t, but if he does, he’s not telling.

Today in [There’s Opportunity in Uncertainty](http://online.barrons.com/article/SB50001424052970204743004575622694164710232.html), I build on some themes from a previous September column, [Will Market Volatility Return to Crisis Levels?](http://online.barrons.com/article/SB50001424052970204297404575493863568455090.html) and discuss why I think those who have been earning a nice living by selling options steadily for the past two years or so may still be able to carry that strategy forward.

In today’s column, I also mention the sentiment cycle pioneered by [Justin Mamis](http://mamis.com/about.php) in [The Nature of Risk](http://www.amazon.com/Nature-Publishing-Library-Contrary-Opinion/dp/0870341324/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpt_2). As that graphic has never appeared on the blog, I have decided to include it below for reference.

I will take up some of the ideas presented in the Barron’s column, including information risk and price risk, in this space going forward.
