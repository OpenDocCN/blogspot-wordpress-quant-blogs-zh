# VIX and More: VIX Closes Under 60 For Fourth Consecutive Day

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/12/vix-closes-under-60-for-fourth.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/12/vix-closes-under-60-for-fourth.html#0001-01-01)

Today's close was 55.73

The last time the VIX closed under 60 five days in a row was on [October 8th](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/10/yet-another-vix-record-5836.html). Just to set some historical context, the VIX was trading in the 30s at the beginning of that five day stretch.
