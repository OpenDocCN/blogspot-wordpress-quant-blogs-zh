- en: In Gerald Appel’s book, “Technical Analysis – Power Tools For Active Investors”
    he discussed a breadth measure he uses to anticipate market rallies. Bascially,
    he takes a 10-day Exponential Moving Average of the NYSE advancing issues divided
    by the advancers + the decliners. In the book he discusses a system where a strong
    thrust upwards in this indicator frequently leads to rallies. I have found that
    strong downward moves also tend to lead to rallies.

    Tuesday. Below I looked at results for the S&P 500 following any time it dropped

    the max loss that occurred thanks to the Crash of ’87\. You’ll notice I ran the
    test back to 1982\. The reason being that prior to 1982 the system would have
    been a disaster. Look at the returns in the 70’s-1981:'

- en: While the indicator has not always worked, it has done a nice job over the last
    25 years or so. It could also be used as a system parameter for a trade exit.
    Below I show the results of entering an index position when the indicator drops
    below 0.375 and then selling when it moves back above a certain number. Results
    here are from the 1982 – present period and are quite robust.
