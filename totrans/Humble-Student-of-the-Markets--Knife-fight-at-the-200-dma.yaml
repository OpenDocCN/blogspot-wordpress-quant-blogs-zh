- en: ': For the last two days, the SPX tested the 3000 level and its 200 day moving
    average levels and finally broke up today. However, market breadth presents a
    mixed picture. Fresh 52-week highs have been understandably strong for NASDAQ
    stocks, as they have been the recent leadership. However, new highs for both large
    and small caps are less than impressive, which calls into question the sustainability
    of this rally.'
