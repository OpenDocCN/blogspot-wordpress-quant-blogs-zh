- en: Unfortunately, its often the case that not everyone in the team is aware of
    the reason and benefit of a standup;  Standup’s are run with the aim of the team
    collectively being aware of what each team member is doing, and how they are progressing
    towards the goal – being DONE on all stories for the sprint.

    recall what area of the code they are working in.  Classic sign of code scope-creep. 
    The smell in itself will often lead to a failed sprint.
