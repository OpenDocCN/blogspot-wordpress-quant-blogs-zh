    of Labor Statistics (BLS) is one of the most closely watched economic indicators,

    proprietary trading firm, the traders suddenly ran out of the classroom to their

    measurement monitoring in all countries of the world anonymously, without collecting
    any personally identifiable information or providing incentives to respondents.
    RIWI’s technology has collected and analyzed more than 1.5 billion responses globally.
    Critically, in their surveys, they can reach a segment of the population that
    is usually hidden: three quarters of their respondents across the world have not
    answered a survey of any kind in the preceding month. Their surveys strive to
    be as representative of the general online population as possible, without the
    usual bias towards the loud social media voices. This is important in predictive
    data for financial markets, where it is vital to separate noise from signal.'

    international markets as well. Case in point: I watched the German DAX index moved
    sharply higher last week (December 6, 2019 ) due to the huge positive surprise
    (adding 266K jobs instead of the Wall Street consensus of 183K).'

    sign of this surprise using machine learning with the RIWI score as the only feature
    vs. a number of other benchmarks that do not include the RIWI score, and found
    that the RIWI score generates higher predictive accuracy than all other benchmarks
    during cross validation test. We also predicted both the magnitude and sign of
    the NFP surprise. Including the RIWI score as one of the features achieved the
    smallest averaged cross-validated mean squared error (MSE) than otherwise. Limited
    out-of-sample results indicate the RIWI score continues to have significant power
    for both sign and magnitude predictions.

    numbers were released on the first Friday of every month, at 8:30 am ET (except
    on certain national holidays when they are released one day before or delayed
    by one week.) To compute the surprise, we subtract the Wall Street consensus on
    the day before the announcement from the actual NFP number.

    such as their employment status (full-time/part-time/student/retired), marital
    status, etc. In order to merge the two datasets, we regard respondents who said
    they worked “full-time” or “part-time” as equivalent to “working more than 35
    hours per week”. If we were to count only the “full-time” respondents, a significant
    structural break in the time series would be observed between the two time periods,

    “Weighted” in the figure captions. Note that the survey is conducted such that
    each respondent can go back and change their answers but they will not show up
    as more than one sample in the data set. In order to extract a summary score in
    advance of each month’s NFP announcement, we compute a monthly average of the
    product of the respondents’ weights and the indicator (0 or 1) of whether the
    individual respondent is working full or part-time. The monthly average is computed
    over the same month that the NFP number measures. We call this the “RIWI score”.

    differences of the RIWI score. We employ the same adjustment that the BLS uses:'
