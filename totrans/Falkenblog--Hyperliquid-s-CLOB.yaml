- en: The latest horrid DEX simulacrum is [Hyperlink](https://hyperliquid.xyz/), a
    perp CLOB emphasizing shit coins. It runs on its own dapp-specific L1 using a
    version of Tendermint, the favorite consensus mechanism for those prioritizing
    speed.

- en: I listened to a *Flirting with Models* [podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqCksxcX49w&list=WL&index=4&t=366s)
    with founder Jeff Yan, where he spoke with Corey Hoffstein, a quantitative long-term
    equity portfolio manager. Hoffstein's background and demeanor prevented him from
    calling out Yan's BS, which is fine because most good podcast hosts are credulous
    and agreeable; otherwise, no one would go on their shows. Yan spouts many typical
    crypto/market maker cliches among those trying to impress people who are vaguely
    familiar with the issues. For example, when talking about his earlier trading
    experience, he said he 'was surprised how inefficient markets were.' This is a
    great phrase because it implies one was outsmarting people, an alpha generator,
    and it does exist, so it is possible.

- en: Yet, one should provide several good examples to demonstrate you are more than
    just bloviating. In crypto, there was the famous Kimchi premium, where coins traded
    at 10% in Asian countries. This inefficiency persisted because it required trusted
    partners in the US and Japan or Korea to make the trade, which is non-trivial.
    In any case, it was over by early 2018 and required connections instead of savvy.
    Nonetheless, many Sam Bankman-Fried interviewers were blown away by SBF's singular
    arbitrage example, presumably one of his many clever trades. Looking back at Alameda's
    tax returns and the fact that most FTX traders left FTX throughout 2018 (no bonus
    pool), this was likely his only profitable trade outside of buying coins in the
    2021 bubble with customer funds (see [here](https://efalken.substack.com/p/ftxs-mythical-origin-story)
    for more). Thus, we have FTX exec Sam Trabucco bragging about their other genius
    trade idea, buying Doge when Elon Musk tweeted about it. The Kimchi premium was
    the only inefficiency Yan mentioned on the podcast.

    strategies, Yan stated that a taker strategy might make only one trade a day.
    An HFT taker strategy involves sniping the top of the book before an LP can cancel.
    By definition, it can''t do this to a large volume, as the top of the book is
    not big. The edge is the spread at best. That''s a large amount of risk and capital,
    adding up to a couple of bucks per day. He described a strategy that has never
    existed because it makes no sense: a once-a-day HFT taker strategy.'

- en: Yan highlighted that Hyperlink's L1 can do things that would otherwise be impossible
    and emphasized updating a perp account for hourly funding payments. This is pointless.
    Given the horizon of perp traders—days, weeks—crediting their accounts hourly
    instead of waiting until the position is closed is pointless. A 50% funding rate
    is a 1% potential boost for a week-long position, which would be long for perps.
    No rational trader will be excited by having that trivial amount accelerated into
    hourly payments. Again, this highlights Yan's cluelessness.

- en: Yan says he then decided to build an exchange on his own L1 because of the Impermanent
    Loss problem in AMMs. I agree that Uniswap's AMMs are unsustainable because they
    lose more money to this expense, but CLOBs on blockchains are not the solution.
    A fast L1 will still be slow because the CEXs are centralized, and co-located
    servers can respond to exchange messages within 5 microseconds. A centralized
    L1 is pointless, like a private permissioned blockchain. With decentralization,
    you have geographic diversity among validators, which takes you to 100 milliseconds
    if you restrict yourself to one hemisphere. It will always be a price follower
    for coins listed on CEXs, so its market makers will be scalped just like they
    are on AMMs. However, their select market makers will make money, but not for
    the reasons they state. [As for the unlisted coins, there is no need for speed,
    as they are less correlated with the big two that move secondary crypto coins
    around (ETH and BTC). The only people who should be market making shit coins are
    their insiders]

- en: The main problem with a dapp-specific L1 is that the chain validators and the
    protocol are equal partners, as the gas and trade fees all support that one dapp.
    The incentives of the DEX and L1 insiders are perfectly aligned, so insider collusion
    is the default assumption. They probably give insiders a latency advantage by
    giving them effective co-location, and prioritization in sequencing transactions
    within a block. However, as officially a decentralized L1, this would be unacknowledged. 
    As LP cancellations are explicitly prioritized over trades, the Hyperlink insiders
    can make consistent money-making markets, unlike in Uniswap.

- en: Hyperlink conspicuously claims to be decentralized. Yet they currently have
    centralized control over their L1 validators, bridge, their oracle, and whoever
    is running their primary market-making strategy (currently working *pro bono*
    because that's what trustless anonymous crypto insiders do!). They restrict IP
    access to avoid US regulators, which would not be possible on a genuinely decentralized
    dapp. While Binance and Bitmex almost surely have insiders making their markets
    with privileged access, they at least have the decency not to pretend these are
    decentralized exchanges.

- en: Its disingenuous design encourages the worst in crypto, which is saying something.
    For example, it wasn't until SBF created his unregulated offshore exchange FTX
    that things took off for SBF. He claimed to be trading $300MM/day when he approached
    VCs for funding in July 2019, though you won't find more than a handful of mentions
    about their exchange on Reddit or other forums where people talk about their crypto
    activities. FTX released a White Paper on how many crypto exchanges were faking
    volume to boost interest, which is a great way to learn about these tactics—and
    what not to do—and disarm people who might accuse you of faking your trading metrics.
    As we now know, SBF and his team were like [Alex Mashinsky](https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/13/business/celsius-alex-mashinsky-charged-with-fraud/index.html#:~:text=US%20prosecutors%20charged%20the%20former,wire%20fraud%20and%20commodities%20fraud.),
    liars who emphasized their unique integrity and decentralization, making them
    safer and morally superior to his competitors. We should not be surprised that
    SBF and Mashinsky moved on to stealing customer funds to gamble on shit coins
    because that's what liars do, like the [scorpion on the frog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scorpion_and_the_Frog);
    it's in their nature.

- en: Their L1 does not have a native token, so it just takes USDC collateral from
    Arbitrum to bridge to their chain. Users thus have the hacking risk of the Arbitrum
    and Hyperlink bridge and worry about USDC censorship (if you get flagged, your
    USDC is effectively zeroed out). With just their trusted version of USDC, the
    famously fraudulent perp finance rate is the only mechanism that ties their perp
    prices to spot prices on off-chain assets. Yan mentioned this was discovered in
    trad-fi, indicating he probably heard stories about how Nobel Laureate Robert
    Shiller introduced a different version in 1991\. He probably does not realize
    that the Bitmex perp/spot funding rate mechanism is nothing like Shiller's perpetual
    real-estate futures contract, which, in any case, never caught on in trad-fi because
    it was fatally flawed. Many perps work fine without the perp/spot funding rate
    ruse, highlighting its irrelevance. The perp funding rate mechanism is just an
    excuse to comfort traders to believe these perp prices are not mere Shelling points
    but are tied down by arbitrage (see [here](https://efalken.substack.com/p/perp-funding-rates-dont-do-what-they)
    for more on that).

- en: If you go to Hyperliquid's Discord or search them on YouTube, most of the content
    is focused on schemes to get free money via rewards, giving them tokens from their
    airdrop. Everyone is wash trading to collect points, as there are no fees or gas
    costs. There's also a referral program, and I'm sure many have gamed that, as
    it's easy to create seemingly unrelated accounts on the blockchain. Their fake
    trading is already twice that of Bitmex and ten times that of GMX ($1B/day—heh).
