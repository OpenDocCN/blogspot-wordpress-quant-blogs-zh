    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    signal. A bullish Trend Model signal that gets less bullish is a trading "sell"
    signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading
    "buy" signal. The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of
    the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. Past trading of
    the trading model has shown turnover rates of about 200% per month.

    show when I received a frantic text message that the neighboring building was
    on fire. Fire fighters were spraying our building as a preventive measure. Mrs.
    Humble Student of the Market rushed home to rescue the family dog. The house next
    door was burning to the ground and we were ordered to evacuate. We discovered
    the next day that our unit suffered water and smoke damage, and it would take
    several weeks to fix. While the whole episode was disconcerting, it was not a
    total disaster.
