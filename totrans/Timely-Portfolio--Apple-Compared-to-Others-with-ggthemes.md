# Timely Portfolio: Apple Compared to Others with ggthemes

> 来源：[http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2012/12/apple-compared-to-others-with-ggthemes.html#0001-01-01](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2012/12/apple-compared-to-others-with-ggthemes.html#0001-01-01)

For a happy person delightfully concentrated in Apple, I wanted to show Apple’s performance versus Microsoft and Cisco in decades 1(1990-2000) and 2 (2000-2012).  I thought this would give me a good chance to try out the very interesting work being done at [https://github.com/jrnold/ggthemes](https://github.com/jrnold/ggthemes "https://github.com/jrnold/ggthemes").

Just as a reference, my general goto chart is theEconomist set from latticeExtra.  Here is how it would look with that method.  I think it is still my favorite.

For another chart since 2003 prepared by the far more capable at the Wall Street Journal, see [Why Microsoft Beats Apple](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324595904578121334162054890.html) hat tip from [Stock Picking Matters: Apple v Microsoft](http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2012/11/stock-picking-matters-apple-v-microsoft/) from [The Big Picture](http://www.google.com/reader/view/feed/http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ritholtz.com%2Fblog%2Ffeed%2F) by Global Macro Monitor with a hat tip from [Jason **Zweig**](https://twitter.com/jasonzweigwsj).

My best guess in terms of the debate is some other company will resoundingly beat both Microsoft and Apple over the next decade.
