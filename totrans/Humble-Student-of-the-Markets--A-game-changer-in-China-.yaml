    In the wake of the global financial crisis, China’s initial response of massive
    $586b stimulus program that helped to stabilize the Chinese and world economy,
    but created a problem by blowing an asset bubble. Chinese stimulus was directed
    mainly at fixed investment and created excess capacity, which will eventually
    end up in a bust. A better solution would have been to stimulate consumer demand,
    which would have better re-balanced its current account and fund flow problems,
    as well as dampen the trade tensions she has with her biggest customer, the United
    States.

    We have been told that the value of the condo we bought last year has gone up
    30% based on sales of new nearby developments, but it’s impossible to confirm
    since there is no secondary market.

- en: The average property tax in the U.S. is 0.95% of assessed value, which for serious
    real estate investors represents a relatively modest cost of doing business. But
    for a typical homeowner, such taxes amount to roughly 3% of their income, a not-insignificant
    cash outlay, especially if they are not getting full use out of the property.
    This and other aspects of the U.S. tax system—including the home mortgage interest
    deduction and passive loss rules—create strong incentives for residential property
    owners to either use it to live in or to generate income by renting it to others
    to live in, and penalize them for letting it stand idle. The effect is to keep
    housing prices closely tethered to real end-use demand for livable space, by driving
    owners to find such uses. Investor sentiment can push those prices too high or
    too low for a time, but the need to find actual occupants eventually forces a
    correction.

    be relatively attractive option. Unless they already possess offshore funds, Chinese
    citizens have limited investment choices: they can gamble on an unstable domestic
    stock market, buy low-yielding government bonds, or stash their cash in even lower-yielding
    bank deposits. By contrast, real estate—occupied or not—offers them a visibly
    reassuring place to park their money, sheltered from inflation. Americans have
    long been familiar with this advantage to owning a home, but with little or no
    holding costs, Chinese owners are unconstrained by the need to make the property
    “pay” in cash or in kind. For them, an empty condo is a store of value, much like
    gold, another asset that performs no practical function besides retaining its
    worth.'

    it’s emblematic of an important difference in outlook. There’s an old story reported
    by an American journalist in Shanghai after the end of World War II. Ravaged by
    hyperinflation, locals had turned to using tins of sardines as an alternative
    currency. One recent arrival opened his “proceeds” from a sale only to find the
    sardines inside were spoiled. He complained to the other trader, who cried, “You
    opened them? My God, man! Those sardines aren’t for eating, they’re for buying
    and selling.” Apartments in China aren’t for living in, they’re for investing.
    That is the real source of demand.

    liquidity injections into the economy became a less liquid form of money, i.e.
    real estate, Let's call that M4 (= M3 + real estate held as money). If the authorities
    want to control the growth of M4, then they have to create disincentives to the
    use of real estate as a store of wealth by instituting western style asset-based
    property tax.
