- en: The china vs taiwan spread trade has done well in the short term with 7% gains
    over the last two days, but not for the reasons I discussed in the previous post.
    I noticed that the markets are cointegrated, however moves in the china market
    (both positive and negative) have a steeper slope, so that positive and negative
    moves are bigger with FXI than for EWT.

- en: Given the current downward trend for FXI, the FXI – EWT spread contracted, yielding
    7%. Of course should the trend reverse and FXI recover, would expect the spread
    to flip back to a widening phase.

    the indian market accompanied with a deflation of the chinese market bubble. Speculative
    trade: short FXI, long INP.'
