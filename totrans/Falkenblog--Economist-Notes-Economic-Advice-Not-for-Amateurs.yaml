    set of mathematical tools such as real analysis, method of moment estimators,
    and dynamic programming, these essential tools are clearly not understood by your
    average commentator, justifying this belief. Why listen to someone's opinion on

    So, readers should only trust PhD economists who understand these tools, and also
    the context in which they are applied. Having a couple business cycles worth of
    experience actually presenting micro and macro forecasts to CEOs and other key
    decision-makers, or running a portfolio that is marked to market, as also essential.
    As economists are primarily experts in models, applied to cherry-picked datasets
    that present cute results that showcase some novel cleverness, they are ignorant
    of the their ignorance. Their models are like the electric car, always just around
    the corner to viability. With hindsight, predicting business cycles--anything
    really--is very simple. You need someone who has been doing it in real time, with
    real feedback, giving you advice.

    also uncromulent. They must also remind people that "chief economist" is a PR
