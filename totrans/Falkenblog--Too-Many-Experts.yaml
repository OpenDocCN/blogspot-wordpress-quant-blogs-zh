    diversity means those who ignore diversity have more moral clout. Thus, my kid's
    schools do not have little birthday celebrations (eg, cupcakes) anymore because
    the new Somalis don't celebrate birthdays, and we wouldn't want to implicitly
    single them by having birthdays as was done for years. No one can mention this
    sucks in public, however, without being called in intolerant bigot, and as we
    all know, diversity is The Most Important Thing public schools teach. Or a bunch

    to them as shiksas and goyim, and the locals, not the new asocial group, needed
    to learn to 'understand and respect each other's differences'. An institution
    that employs a bunch of autistic types is 'diverse', even though no individual
    who works there is accepting of diversity except management. Thus, diversity is
    about acceptance when you are passive or 'leading', but for those who are not
    considerate about existing mores or who are doing, it's a pretext for being insular.

    for machines trying to pass a Turing test, such as the fact that being 'hot',
    'cool', or 'warm' are all compliments. Similarly, experts are supposed to tell
    one what to do, but in practice they merely help rationalize whatever one wants
    to do. Expert opinion usually spans the space of conceivable opinion. To wit,

- en: The point is that expert opinion does not focus, but from a meta perspective,
    merely rationalizes. Thus, it means almost the opposite of what a single expert
    does. The paradox is like the way diversity, in practice, is license to insularity.
    A thing in practice is the opposite of what it is in theory.
