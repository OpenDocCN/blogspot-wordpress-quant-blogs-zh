- en: 'on about the subprime problem. Elizabeth Warren talked about how come toasters
    don''t blow up at the same rate as financial instruments? Answer: regulation!
    Merton, speaks last, and says, paraphrasing, ''I agree with all the distinguish
    commenter prior to me and only have a few things to add...I don''t think regulation
    is a solution because these areas were already highly regulated, and many regulators
    were pushing mortgage innovations that were part of the problem, not the solution.'''

  zh: 关于次贷问题进行了讨论。伊丽莎白·沃伦谈到了为什么烤面包机不会像金融工具那样频繁爆炸？答案是：监管！默顿最后发言，大意是说，“我同意之前所有杰出评论者的观点，我只想补充几点...我认为监管不是解决方案，因为这些领域已经高度监管，许多监管机构推动的抵押贷款创新正是问题的一部分，而非解决方案。”

- en: Specificity matters. As most concerns about Fannie and freddie were about their
    interest rate risk, and academics and regulators were pushing for lowering underwriting
    standard under the banner of increasing home ownership. 'More' regulation would
    not have helped given those priorities.

  zh: 特定性很重要。鉴于大多数对房利美和房地美的担忧都集中在它们的利率风险上，而学者和监管机构正推动降低承保标准，以提高房屋所有权的名义。在这种情况下，'更多'的监管并不会有所帮助。
- en: 'Many of the concerns mentioned, are spilled milk. That is, worry about people
    being able to securitize loans with little recourse to the originator no more.
    There are no buyers for this kind of paper. Other issues, I think, would make
    things much worse. That is, focusing on helping the current mortgage owners by
    forestalling bankruptcy just makes the problem worse, because it increases the
    time were no one really owns the property. Giving the current mortgage owner an
    option at a time when he has no skin in the game, just creates a situation where
    you are creating hundreds of thousands of people with bad incentives: they should
    squeeze the banks to the degree they can per the law, because they have zero to
    lose.'

  zh: 许多提到的担忧，已是泼出去的水。也就是说，担心人们能够无追索权地证券化贷款已不再重要。这种债券已无人问津。其他问题，我认为，会使情况变得更糟。也就是说，通过推迟破产来帮助当前的抵押贷款所有者只会使问题恶化，因为它延长了无人真正拥有财产的时间。在抵押贷款所有者没有利益关系时给予他们选择权，只会创造出数十万人拥有不良激励的局面：他们应该根据法律尽可能地向银行施压，因为他们没有任何损失。
- en: My impression was, warnings by Rogoff, Mankiw and Merton would go unheeded,
    and Harvard would prioritize more cookie cutter regulation that merely would increase
    the costs of lending under the guise of helping the little guy. William F. Buckley
    once famously said he would rather be ruled by the first 100 names in the phone
    book than the faculty at Harvard. I agree. Their average opinion is usually a
    train wreck based on top-down egalitarianism based on flawed assumptions about
    human nature and the relative ethics of the poor vs businessmen (the poor are
    saintly naifs fighting selfish captains of industry).

  zh: 我的印象是，罗格夫、曼昆和默顿的警告将被忽视，哈佛将优先考虑更多标准化监管，这只会以帮助普通人为名增加贷款成本。威廉·F·巴克利曾有名言，他宁愿被电话簿上的前100个名字统治，也不愿被哈佛的教职员工统治。我同意。他们的平均观点通常是基于对人性及穷人与商人相对道德的错误假设的顶层平等主义，结果往往是一场灾难。
