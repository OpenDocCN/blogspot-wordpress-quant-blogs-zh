    don''t blow up at the same rate as financial instruments? Answer: regulation!
    Merton, speaks last, and says, paraphrasing, ''I agree with all the distinguish
    commenter prior to me and only have a few things to add...I don''t think regulation
    is a solution because these areas were already highly regulated, and many regulators
    were pushing mortgage innovations that were part of the problem, not the solution.'''

    so much.

    interest rate risk, and academics and regulators were pushing for lowering underwriting
    standard under the banner of increasing home ownership. 'More' regulation would
    not have helped given those priorities.

    being able to securitize loans with little recourse to the originator no more.
    There are no buyers for this kind of paper. Other issues, I think, would make
    things much worse. That is, focusing on helping the current mortgage owners by
    forestalling bankruptcy just makes the problem worse, because it increases the
    time were no one really owns the property. Giving the current mortgage owner an
    option at a time when he has no skin in the game, just creates a situation where
    you are creating hundreds of thousands of people with bad incentives: they should
    squeeze the banks to the degree they can per the law, because they have zero to
    lose.'

- en: My impression was, warnings by Rogoff, Mankiw and Merton would go unheeded,
    and Harvard would prioritize more cookie cutter regulation that merely would increase
    the costs of lending under the guise of helping the little guy. William F. Buckley
    once famously said he would rather be ruled by the first 100 names in the phone
    book than the faculty at Harvard. I agree. Their average opinion is usually a
    train wreck based on top-down egalitarianism based on flawed assumptions about
    human nature and the relative ethics of the poor vs businessmen (the poor are
    saintly naifs fighting selfish captains of industry).
