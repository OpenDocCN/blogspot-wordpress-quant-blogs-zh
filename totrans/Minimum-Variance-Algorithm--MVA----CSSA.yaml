    In practice the minimum variance portfolio can be calculated in closed form only
    for long-short portfolios, and requires a quadratic optimizer to solve for long-only
    portfolios. Source code and examples for  long-only minimum variance can be found
    at [Systematic Investor](http://systematicinvestor.wordpress.com/) – a very good
    blog that also has a toolkit for a lot of standard optimization methods. Michael
    Kapler (the man behind Systematic Investor) and I wrote a whitepaper about an
    algorithm for finding minimum correlation called the [Minimum Correlation Algorithm](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2012/09/21/minimum-correlation-algorithm-paper-release/
    "Minimum Correlation Algorithm Paper Release") (MCA), which was meant to approximate
    [maximum diversification portfolios](http://www.iijournals.com/doi/abs/10.3905/jpm.2008.35.1.40).
    The primary benefits of the algorithm versus the conventional optimization were:
    1) speed of computation and ease of calculation 2) greater robustness to estimation
    error and 3) superior risk dispersion.  Testing results across a wide array of
    universes also demonstrated the superiority of MCA in terms of risk-adjusted returns
    versus its maximum diversification counterpart. The Minimum Variance Algorithm
    (MVA) is a close relative to MCA and shares the same benefits versus conventional
    minimum variance optimization. In testing, MVA showed superior risk-adjusted returns
    to MCA across most universes. While I have not yet conducted comparisons versus
    conventional minimum variance, preliminary results are very competitive. This
    is encouraging considering that MVA is very simple to calculate. Later this week
    I will present the logic and also post a spreadsheet for calculation along with
    some test results.'
