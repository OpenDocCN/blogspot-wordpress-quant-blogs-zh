    In the United States, the Department of the Treasury, not the Federal Reserve,

    toward the dollar; and the Secretary of the Treasury has expressed the view that
    the determination of the value of the U.S. dollar should be left to free market
    forces. Moreover, since the United States is a large, relatively closed economy,
    manipulating the exchange value of the dollar would not be a particularly desirable
    way to fight domestic deflation, particularly given the range of other options
