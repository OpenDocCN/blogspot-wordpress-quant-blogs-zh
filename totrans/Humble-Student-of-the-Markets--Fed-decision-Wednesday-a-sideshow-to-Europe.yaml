    In the United States, the Department of the Treasury, not the Federal Reserve,

    manipulating the exchange value of the dollar would not be a particularly desirable

- en: Get ready for the fireworks. My inner trader is wincing at the prospect of volatility
    of more up and down 2% days. My inner investor tells me that anything that the
    Fed does is likely to be a sideshow. If the Fed were to announce an unexpected
    round of stimulus, the markets may rally, but the final resolution will depend
    on how the European sovereign crisis is resolved.
