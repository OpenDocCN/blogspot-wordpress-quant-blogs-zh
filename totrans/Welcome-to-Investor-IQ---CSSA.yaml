- en: There is some interesting new content on the CSSA blog that will be very useful
    for readers. Investor IQ is currently a free tool that shows basic trend signals
    (Buy, Hold or Sell) for a wide range of US and Canadian ETFs as well as a relative
    strength ranking. The signals will be updated as of the close of Friday and posted
    on Monday morning. This feature is currently in Beta and will be expanded to include
    individual stocks and other analytics. It can be found on the blog under the tab
    [“CSSA”](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/about/) as a dropdown menu. A sample
    of some of the output can be seen below. More details to follow……
