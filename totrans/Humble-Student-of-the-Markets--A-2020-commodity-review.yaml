    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time

    contraction (bearish)?"

    bulls got excited when prices had broken out of a multi-year base last summer.
    They then paused and traced out a bull flag. Gold then staged an upside breakout
    out of the bull flag, and rose to test resistance as geopolitical tensions spiked.
    More importantly, the inflation expectations ETF (RINF) staged an upside breakout
    out of a downtrend.

    it to its strongest level since early August. The currency punched past the key

    for the first time since May. The CSI 300 Index of stocks closed at an almost
