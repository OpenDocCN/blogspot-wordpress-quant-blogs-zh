# Humble Student of the Markets: My answer to John Hussman

I have the greatest of respect for John Hussman. His

[weekly commentary](http://www.hussmanfunds.com/weeklyMarketComment.html)

has always a must-read for me. So it was with much interest that I watched the

[video](//www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYkCaUB1BQY&feature=player_embedded)

of his speech from the Wine Country Conference (via

[Mebane Faber](http://www.mebanefaber.com/2013/04/18/hussman-speech-from-wine-country/)

).

I came away thinking that while I agree with Hussman's analysis on many fronts, we came away with some very different conclusions - a result that I will explain.

**Where I agree with Hussman**

If you watch the video, you will see that at the beginning, John Hussman states that he believes that much scarce savings has been squandered. Instead of directing savings towards productive innovation, e.g. robotics, etc., it has gone into financial manipulation (my words, not his) in trying to save the current system.

I completely agree.

Hussman went on to say that QE doesn't work to stimulate long-term sustainable growth. It only serves to drive down interest rates and lower the risk premium, which results in a speculative reach for yield.

I agree.

He went on to outline his 10-year return expectations for stocks. Based on various approaches, he gets an expected return of roughly 3.5%. Indeed,

[Mark Hulbert](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/finding-the-best-four-year-market-forecaster-2013-04-19)

highlighted a similar conclusion based on the 3-5 year appreciation potential of stocks from the Value Line Investment Survey.

**Hussman 10-year equity return expectations**

Unfortunately for the investor, there are no good alternatives in the current QE environment. Expected returns are low for all asset classes.

Hussman called the current environment "An Unstable Equilibrium". In other words, the markets are an accident waiting to happen.

I agree with his analysis. While stocks returns can be relatively benign in the short to medium term, there are at least two major macro tail risks that we have to be concerned about: France (see

[Short France?](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2013/04/short-france.html)

) and China (see

[The canaries in the Chinese coalmine](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2013/01/the-canaries-in-chinese-coalmine.html)

and

[An update on my Chinese canaries](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2013/03/an-update-on-my-chinese-canaries.html)

). In other words, the markets can behave for a while and then the roof could suddenly cave in. That's why we have an unstable equilibrium.

**Same analysis, different conclusions**

What can an investor do under these circumstances? That's where I differ from John Hussman. It appears that Hussman manages his fund primarily based on his 10-year rate of return outlook expectation. If return expectations for all asset classes are low, it makes sense to focus on capital preservation and to go long opportunistically. It's a long-term investment viewpoint, much like the sort adopted by pension fund committees and fiduciaries that I used to speak to in my previous life as an institutional money manager. I understand that point of view completely.

Today, I, along with people like Mebane Faber, believe that we have models that can trade the swings in this market - and there are plenty of swings. In effect, Hussman is saying that we are in a modern day depression - sort of a Japanese Lost Decades-like environment. The economies of the developed world is likely to go through cycles of upswings caused by fiscal and monetary stimulus and declines as the stimulus is withdrawn, largely scarce savings is not being directed at productive investments.

My principal approach is to use my

[Inflation-Deflation Trend Allocation Model](http://qwestfunds.com/publications/newsletters_pdf/2009_issues/newsletter_november_2009.pdf)

, supplemented by

[price momentum](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2012/09/momentum-bull-market-chocolate-peanut.html)

at the appropriate times. While Hussman's time horizon is measured in years, my time horizon is measured in weeks and months. That's why, despite the poor long-term return expectations, I can be relatively sanguine on the outlook for the stock market. (More on that in a future post.)
