    with so many stocks, so he needs to have a relatively high level of conviction
    that he is right, since he''s going to hold a pretty concentrated portfolio, say
    10 or 20 stocks ... A qual needs to be careful about not making mistakes--one
    bad mistake in a 10-stock portfolio can get ugly!" He continued: "A quant, on
    the other hand, has the ability to study thousands of stocks at once, and thus
    can hold much more broadly diversified portfolios. Because quants hold so many
    stocks, ones that are even slightly misvalued may still make sense ... If you
    can find 500 stocks to bet on where each has a 51 percent chance of beating the
    market, then through diversification, the odds of your overall portfolio start
    to look pretty good.'

- en: For a fundamental investor who strenuously researches the company, the answer
    is a zero weight. For a quant who holds a large number of positions in his portfolio
    and depends on a statistical edge in stock picking, the answer is likely a non-zero
    weight, equal to the index weight (12%) less the size of the bet (probably between
    1.5% and 3%). In the latter case of the quantitative investor, the correct answer
    is likely between 9.0% and 10.5%.
