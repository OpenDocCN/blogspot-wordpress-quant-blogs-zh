    why it is difficult. Moreover, different types of quantitative trading suffer
    from differing complexities, such as: mathematical modeling, information access
    (*e.g.* tick-level data), computational facilities, execution facilities (*e.g.*
    low latency), risk management (*e.g.* real-time [VaR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_at_risk)),
    and leverage (*e.g.* RegT vs [portfolio margin](http://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nyse/2006/34-54918.pdf)).'

    and formally means an assumption that randomness can be modeled as a *stationary
    ergodic process*. Stationarity refers to statistic properties not changing over
    time. Ergodicity refers to such properties being deducible from a single, sufficiently
    long sample of the random process. Unfortunately, both are bogus for the vast
    majority of quantitative finance (otherwise, every first-year econometrics grad
    student would be rich).

    techniques assuming stationary ergodicity are used to build systems, to which
    their authors attribute explanatory power for behavior of a set of instruments.
    Unfortunately, in practice, the *resulting statistical models tend to be insufficiently
    stable and thus have limited success in generating consistent profit*.'
