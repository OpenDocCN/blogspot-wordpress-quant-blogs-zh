    higher annual returns than average, which creates a great two-fer investment strategy
    because you get a higher return, with lower volatility and beta. If you go to

    They are wrong, but on one level it doesn''t matter: low volatility stocks still
    dominate the indexes in Sharpe ratios, or any ''risk-reward'' metric you can concoct.
    But it matters a lot theoretically, because if higher risk generates lower returns,
    the whole ''risk premium'' theory that underlies so much economic reasoning is
    empty, invalidating a lot research.'

    minus the volatility from systematic factors. Basically, you take an 'excess'
    return, after subtracting a return from its market beta (standard CAPM), and the
    returns from 'size' and 'value' proxies.

    them, the large negative correlation between idiosyncratic volatality and return
    goes away. Further, when they form quintile portfolios based on market cap, so
    each portfolio is from largest to smallest, but the first portfolio contains many
    firms equal to 20% of the market, the top portfolio the fewest stocks, but includes
    large stocks, the results for value or equal weighted portfolios is not correlated
    with idiosyncratic volatility. Lastly, they look at large/liquid, lorge/high-price,
    and liquid/high priced subsamples, and again find no relation.

    via abstruse statistics, but careful slicing of the data. For example, early in
    equity research, people included all firms, including really small firms no one
    could really buy much of, and weighting them like the S&P500 stocks. These small
    firms had really large bid-ask spreads, and so as they traded at their bid of
    1.00 to their ask of 1.25, you would record a return of 25%, when instead the
    closing price merely recorded a last trade at the bid going to the ask. Then when
    it went down to 1.00 again, the loss was only 20%, resulting in a phantom return
    of +5% even though the price went from 1.00 to 1.25 to 1.00\. Other biases from
    small firms is they delist frequently, and when they delist the returns were hugely
    negative, about -50%, but this would be marked as 'N/A', greatly biasing returns.
    One only has to note the huge premiums documented in 'low price' stocks in the
    1980s, and the embarrassing failure of 'low price' stock funds that were popular
    at the end of the eighties, to note that such findings were artifacts of bias.

    via volatility, the null result may simply the result of dilution via this prefiltering.
    I mean, after you control for size in quintiles, and then via the size factor
    return, you don't have a lot of volatility dispersion left. As size and value
    don't have any real basis in my mind, I would try simple 'total volatility' as
    an alternative, once one has enough size/liquidity.

    as the average holding period for a stock is around 1 year, you should do a geometric
    adjustment which lowers the return by the annualized variance divided by two,
    which makes the high vol quintiles look worse. But forget that. Note that in the
    'standard case', there's a massive 10% difference between high and low volatility
    stocks. This clearly is 'too high'. But their new finding is still 3%, though
    he states these have t-stats of only 1-ish, insignificant. What Bali and Cakici
    call 'no robust, significant relation' just means it's not huge, but rather the
    kind of modest improvement one would expect given that large opportunities in
    liquid stocks are generally arbitraged out of the market. The relation remains
    precisely because it is so unsexy.
