- en: When I was a young pup (in the era when we used to program computers with punched
    cards), the three most commonly used valuation ratios for stocks were the P/E
    ratio, the P/B ratio and dividend yield. Now all three of these metrics are pointing
    a long-term low return environment for equity prices.

    relative to its own history, even adjusted for the current low level of interest
    rates (see

- en: The SP 500′s current dividend yield is 1.94%, which echoes the interpretation
    of most other valuation metrics.  Stocks are not necessarily expensive relative
    to their average value over the last 15 years, but are very expensive relative
    to long term history.  In past posts, I’ve toyed with the idea that this might
    be justified–[maybe we’re in a new paradigm for value](http://avondaleam.com/different-era-equity-multiples/
    "Are we In a Different Era For Equity Multiples?").  But if we are in a new era
    of structurally higher values, then we have to consider an important ***result
    that comes with that.  If stocks are structurally more expensive than they were
    in the 20th century, can we expect to receive the same rates of return that we
    did in that era?***  If we are leaving the 20th century behind, then maybe we
    have to leave behind our concept of fair returns on investment.  ***Dividends
    are one signal telling us to lower our expectations.***

    not stupidly high. None of these metrics are pointing to a market crash around
    the corner. However, as the major US equity averages have broken out to new all-time
    highs, I have seen technicians calling for a new secular bull market, with the
    expectation that returns would be similar to the 1982-2000 era, or the 1947-1966
    era.

    If this is indeed a secular bull, then investors should expect long-term returns
    to be far more muted than the last two secular bull markets.

    5.0% (an arbitrary assumption, but roughly in the right ballpark).

- en: Supposing that instead of correcting, stocks were to rise 25% in a single year,
    but 10 year returns stay at 5%. Simple math tells us that the return for the remaining
    9 years comes to 3%, which would make equity prices highly stretched as they would
    be unattractive relative to 10-year Treasury yields.

- en: On the other hand, a 15% pullback in a year would raise 9 year expected returns
    to 7.5%, which is a level that is far more interesting for investors. You can
    play around with some of the assumptions, but the bottom line is that equities
    do not have room for the kinds of rallies that we saw in the 1980's and 1990's.
