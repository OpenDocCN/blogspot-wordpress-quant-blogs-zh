    finance ministers prepare to meet to avert a cash crunch for the region’s most-indebted

- en: The Greek proposal “doesn’t meet the criteria agreed upon in the Eurogroup on
    Monday,” German Finance Ministry spokesman Martin Jaeger said in an e-mailed statement.
    “In truth, it aims at bridge financing without meeting the requirements” of the
    rescue program. European Commission Spokesman Margaritis Schinas moments earlier
    had said the Greek letter could be the basis for a “reasonable compromise.”

- en: The fact that the Greek proposal for a six month extension was rejected couldn't
    have been a surprise. The details of the proposal were already leaked on Wednesday.
    The terms were the same as the one that the Eurogroup had already rejected. So
    the official reaction should not have been a surprise.

    three-year notes down 28 basis points at 17.09 percent at 5:33 p.m. in Athens***.
    That compares with a record 128 percent in March 2012\. Greek stocks advanced
    for a second day, with the Athens Stock Exchange benchmark up 1.1 percent.

    tells a similar story. Greek stocks look washed out, especially when they don't

    to FEZ, the Euro STOXX 50 ETF, shows that Greek stocks have been in a relative
    uptrend against eurozone stocks since the end of January. When the news hit the
    tape of the German rejection of the latest Greek proposal, the relative performance
    chart barely budged.

    as a Greek default or Greek exit from the eurozone, pretty much all the bad news
    is in Greek stocks and bonds. If you want to bottom fish, you may think about
    buying Greek paper, either in its debt or equities, as a speculative buy at these
    levels.
