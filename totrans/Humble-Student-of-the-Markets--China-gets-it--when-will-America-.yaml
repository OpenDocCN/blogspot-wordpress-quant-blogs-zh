- en: Inflation is redistributive, usually unfairly. First, low-income people tend
    not to have debt, because they are usually not qualified to borrow from banks.
    When inflation surges, as it is happening now, their bank deposits erode in real
    value. Where do their losses go? The people who have debt and real assets, like
    property speculators, gain the same amount. Inflation essentially robs the poor
    and gives to the rich.

    up along with inflation, especially when inflation surges like now. The reduced
    purchasing power for their wages pushes them into an unsustainable situation.
    They simply cannot make ends meet.

- en: In 2009, 14.3% of Americans lived in poverty, according to the U.S. Census.
    Including ones that have given up looking for a job, one-sixth of American workers
    are underemployed or unemployed. A huge chunk of American people have no cushion
    against massive increases in the cost of food and energy. In addition, the prices
    of imported consumer goods that low-income Americans depend on are rising and
    are likely to rise much more, later in the year. ***Fifty million Americans are
    not so different from Egyptians in their economic plight. Riots could come to
    American cities.***
