- en: A couple of days ago I posed the question, [Are You Watching Greece?](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/02/are-you-watching-greece.html)
    While I am certain that most investors are doing their best to keep on top of
    the latest news swirling around [Greece](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Greece)
    and the European Union, the smaller question I addressed was which security or
    indicator would give a good glimpse into the status of the Greek problem.

    one could easily argue that the [increase in reserve requirement for Chinese banks](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/13/business/global/13yuan.html)
    is an equally large threat to global economic growth.

    but with all the talk of a [potential real estate bubble](http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/indepth/2010-02/11/c_13171603.htm),
    investors should be focusing a good deal of their attention on Chinese [real estate](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/real%20estate).
    The good news is that there is a Chinese real estate ETF that has a relatively
    long track record, good liquidity, and can serve as an excellent barometer for
    the real estate sector in China. Trading under the ticker [TAO](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TAO),
    the Claymore/AlphaShares China Real Estate ETF ([holdings](http://www.claymore.com/etf/fund/tao/holdings))
    includes REITs and publicly traded firms in the real estate sector in mainland
    China, Hong Kong and Macau.

    below, the long white candle from Wednesday is almost certainly the result of
    erroneous data. Excluding that bad print at the open, Friday’s low of 15.31 has
    all the appearances of at least a short-term cycle low.

    way for foreigners to speculate on Chinese real estate trends and/or hedge their
    portfolios accordingly.
