    the nation's top financial press, and held seminars for other advisers seeking

    He told employees they would be millionaires after just a few years of working

    in what he called the "house accounts."

    Eventually, this cunning plan ran out of money. He was a zero-alpha fraud from
    day one, and when he finally was about to be exposed, he killed himself, writing
    a self-serving suicide note highlighting that he died feeling sorry for himself,
    as if his calculated fraud that created his entire career was some peccadillo
    that would be blown out of proportion.

    have a legal team that meets out punishment after the fact. For cases like Madoff
    or Markman (above) where all the money is gone and no restitution can be made,
    at the very least if the jerk does not kill himself he can die in jail.

    sniffs out frauds before they blow up. In 2005, Harry Markopolous wrote a 21-page
    memo to SEC regulators about Bernie Madoff entitled: "The World''s Largest Hedge
    Fund is a Fraud." Nothing happened. The regional SEC office was aware since 1997
    that Allen Stanford was likely conducting a Ponzi scheme, but no SEC action took
    place until 12 years later when his Ponzi scheme was revealed via a lack of funds,
    costing $8 billion. Too little too late.'
