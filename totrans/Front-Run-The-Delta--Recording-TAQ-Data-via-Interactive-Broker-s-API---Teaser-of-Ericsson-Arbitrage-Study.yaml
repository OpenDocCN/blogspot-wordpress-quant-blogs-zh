    me to record time and sales for individual and groups of securities.  The program
    then dumps this data into a CSV file that I open with Excel.  All the manipulations
    in Excel I handle after the the price data has been cleaned and formatted into
    my formulas.

    low, and close for equities, options, futures, future options, currencies, and
    combinations.  I cannot emphasize enough the importance of synchronized group
    recordings.  The weakness of using minute or even second by second quotes for
    arbitrage strudies is the nature of high-frequency arbitrage trading today makes
    these quotes obsolete.  You can record 2 seconds worth of data that consists of
    100+ quote changes.

    structures is the live bid, ask, and depth of market.  Liquidity risk has killed
    too many titans.

    market.  They are limited to pricing updates at a rate of 100ms when many of today's
    trades occur in the 10-20ms range.  This obstacle has limited my ability to study
    certain HFT strategies at higher granularities than I can record.
