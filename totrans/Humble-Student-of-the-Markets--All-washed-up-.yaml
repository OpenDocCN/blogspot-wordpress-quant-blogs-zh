    Part of my advantage, is that my strength is economic forecasting, but that only
    works in free markets, when markets are smarter than people. That’s how I started.
    I watched the stock market, how equities reacted to change in levels of economic
    activity and I could understand how price signals worked and how to forecast them.
    Today, all these price signals are compromised and I’m seriously questioning whether
    I have any competitive advantage left.

    current market conditions are not conducive to the Trend Model adding very much
