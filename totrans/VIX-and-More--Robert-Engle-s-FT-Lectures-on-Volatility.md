# VIX and More: Robert Engle’s FT Lectures on Volatility

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/10/robert-engles-ft-lectures-on-volatility.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/10/robert-engles-ft-lectures-on-volatility.html#0001-01-01)

I am still not sure why Brenda Jubin’s [Reading the Markets](http://readingthemarkets.blogspot.com/), remains criminally undiscovered, but for those who do not make visiting that blog a daily habit, I feel it my duty to draw attention to some of the excellent work she has been doing lately.

As far as I can tell, Brenda spends part of her free time reading every book ever written about investing and various tangential subjects. Even if this is only a slight exaggeration, her comprehensive review of the investment literature forms a sort of contemporaneous intellectual history of the markets – and for this reason makes it onto my daily reading list.

From time to time, the narrative at Reading the Markets veers in the direction of options and volatility. A particularly valuable contribution has been Brenda’s posting of her notes and graphics on a five-part lecture series given by [Robert Engle](http://www.stern.nyu.edu/rengle/) in July 2007\. One post is devoted to each lecture, with the links to her posts below:

*Reading the Markets – Notes and Graphics:*

Part of the motivation for posting the notes and the graphics is that while the FT Business School – NYU Stern School of Business

[splash page](http://www.ft.com/businesseducation/stern)

has captured the links to transcripts of each of the five addresses, the video links on that page are not functional.

With a little sleuthing, however, I was able to find the video links to each of the five lectures and below I have captured the video and transcript in what I hope is a more useful format:

*FT Business School – NYU Stern School (original content):*

For anyone seeking the key takeaways from this series, I would jump right to Brenda’s comments and graphics. For all the details, the FT-Stern content above is the place to go.

Also worth checking out is the

and its

[Volatility Laboratory](http://vlab.stern.nyu.edu/)
