# Magmasystems Blog: Streambase Again!!!! Arghhhhh !

It seems that

[my posting](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2009/02/streambase-on-move.html)

on Streambase's recent customer win has gotten some people pretty ticked off. I have received some private messages from a few of the CEP vendors who are crying foul. Nobody wants to appear that they have sour grapes against the Streambase win, but of course by contacting me, they know that I will pursue the issue in the interest of fairness and transparency.

The issue revolves around the joint claims by Mark Palmer and Penny Crossman that Phase Capital had evaluated all of the major CEP vendors. Penny had written the following:

PhaseCapital evaluated a number of CEP vendors in the trading space, including [Progress Apama](http://www.progress.com/apama), [Coral8](http://www.coral8.com/), [Aleri](http://www.aleri.com/) and [StreamBase](http://www.streambase.com/).What some of the CEP vendors are claiming is that Phase Capital had never downloaded copies of their products for evaluation, nor contacted the CEP vendor with any questions.

In my experience, before you can download a copy of a CEP product for evaluation, you need to fill out a registration form. Some of the CEP vendors won't even let you download a copy from their website ... they want to pre-certify you by paying you a personal visit.

So, if Phase Capital did not download the evaluation copies, how did they evaluate some of the products. Did they do part of their evaluation from going over a publically available list of features? Did they get information from blogs such as this one? Did they download the product under another name? Did they have a third-party consultant do the evaluations?

Update: They could have gotten the copies from a reseller. Sybase resells a number of CEP products.

In the interest of transparency, I would ask Greg McSweeny from Wall Street and Technology to ask his writer, Penny Crossman, to substantiate what she wrote in her article concerning the competitive evaluation that Phase Capital did between the various CEP products. Penny is the designated beat reporter for the CEP industry, so I would like to see a bit of investigative journalism from her on this matter. Otherwise, serious doubts would still remain as to Phase Capital's evaluation process.

This is why organizations like Stac Research are so important to our industry.
