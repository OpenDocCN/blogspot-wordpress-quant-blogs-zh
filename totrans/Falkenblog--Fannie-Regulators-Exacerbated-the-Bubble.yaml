- en: Today's mea culpa by finance executives includes the overpaid puppets in the
    Fannie/Freddie disaster ($127B and counting). In 2005 the chief regulator of Fannie
    and Freddie was addressing an accounting mini-scandal related to bonuses. They
    were basically moving earnings around to hit triggers, so their executives could
    receive their multi-million dollar bonuses. As Fannie and Freddie are filled with
    political hacks (Jamie Gorelick, Bill Syron, Franklin Raines), these are the prime
    sinecures of top Administration bureaucrats, and Congress appreciates the incentive
    this provides their minions. Ex-congressman are known to get lucrative consulting
    contracts with them. And all of this is subsidized by the U.S. taxpayer.

  zh: 金融执行人员今天的自罪包含了房利美/房地美灾难中被过度支付的傀儡（1270亿美元并且还在增加）。在2005年，房利美和房地美的主要监管机构正在解决与奖金相关的会计小丑闹剧。他们基本上是为了获得数百万美元的奖金而搬来搬去收益。由于房利美和房地美充斥着政治酬金（Jamie
    Gorelick, Bill Syron, Franklin Raines），这些位置是高级政府官员的主要闲职，国会感谢这提供了他们手下的吸引力。前国会议员已知会得到他们的丰厚咨询合同。而所有这一切都是由美国纳税人资助的。
- en: The government support provided to Fannie and Freddie is supposed to be used
    to expand home ownership for lower income Americans, as if that could be done
    at a profit by our wise bureaucrats. What do they think, bankers hate minorities
    more than they like making money? I'm sure there might exist such bankers, though
    I must say I never have met one, and am confident they are about as representative
    of bankers as the KKK is of America (I'm sure many on the far-Left would say--exactly!
    One and the same!).
