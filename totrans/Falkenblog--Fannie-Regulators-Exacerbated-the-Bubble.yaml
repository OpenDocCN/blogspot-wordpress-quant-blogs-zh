- en: Today's mea culpa by finance executives includes the overpaid puppets in the
    Fannie/Freddie disaster ($127B and counting). In 2005 the chief regulator of Fannie
    and Freddie was addressing an accounting mini-scandal related to bonuses. They
    were basically moving earnings around to hit triggers, so their executives could
    receive their multi-million dollar bonuses. As Fannie and Freddie are filled with
    political hacks (Jamie Gorelick, Bill Syron, Franklin Raines), these are the prime
    sinecures of top Administration bureaucrats, and Congress appreciates the incentive
    this provides their minions. Ex-congressman are known to get lucrative consulting
    contracts with them. And all of this is subsidized by the U.S. taxpayer.

    to expand home ownership for lower income Americans, as if that could be done
    at a profit by our wise bureaucrats. What do they think, bankers hate minorities
    more than they like making money? I'm sure there might exist such bankers, though
    I must say I never have met one, and am confident they are about as representative
    of bankers as the KKK is of America (I'm sure many on the far-Left would say--exactly!
    One and the same!).

    is proceeding at a healthy pace. Despite the problems the company has with their
    accounting issues and internal control problems, that side of the business remains
    sound. So I can give you some comfort there, that while we are having to take
    some supervisory actions with the company to make sure that they continue to be
    as aggressive in fulfilling their mission as possible, when we get these other
    issues addressed properly over time, it will not deter them from continuing their
    guarantee side of their business.'

    think here would be a good safeguard to make sure that there are not unnecessary

    did not have comparable home ownership rates for arbitrary--ie, racist--reasons,
    so this effort had a positive expected profit. It was an error in a factual assumption,
    made because many believe institutional racism is very real and important. This
    falsehood has real consequences.

    these GSEs as going concerns, but instead, all they really cared about was fighting
    fires of the past so they could get back to fulfilling its eleemosynary pretext
    for creating a crony-capitalist monopoly to pay off obedient bureaucrats who help
    them maintain their power. The circle was complete. If only the private sector
    consisted solely of government-sanctioned monopolies, it seems, life would be
    great. Unfortunately, the essence of a monopoly is to keep people out, so not
    everyone can get a well-paid sinecure (eg, see Greece).

    Faced with the prospect of becoming irrelevant as private lenders fueled by Wall
    Street took over a larger share of the market, the company opted to strike a "middle
    course" by trying to offer less risky versions of loans.

    the flow, they felt they weren''t taking more risk. Of course, the private label
    mortgage guarantors justified their increased subprime exposure by pointing to
    Freddie and Fannie''s greater subprime portfolio, and on the primrose path we
    went to Armageddon. This is the mechanism for endogenous bubbles, where large
    players increase their exposure into previously risky areas, but don''t notice
    it because each player thinks they are actually reducing their risk by playing
    catch-up in some new paradigm.'
