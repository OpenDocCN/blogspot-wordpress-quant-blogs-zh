    just thought I’d take a couple of minutes during the slow period of the trading
    day to capture a thought or two for archival purposes, but that original intent
    has continued to morph into something far beyond what I imagined.

    aid my personal recollection, but I like to keep things eclectic, provocative
    and visually interesting for the benefit of all.

    be of interest at *VIX and More*. Each year new themes seem to emerge among the
    top 25 most read posts in this space. This year the dominant themes seem to incorporate
    the [VIX-based ETNs](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20ETN) (specifically
    [VXX)](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX), [contango,](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/contango)
    the [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures) [term
    structure](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/term%20structure) and [put
    to call ratios](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/put%20to%20call).
    The #1 post of the year, [The Education of a Trader](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/09/education-of-trader.html),
    is one of the few times I have talked about my own trading, but I imagine it is
    the universality of the message that struck a chord with most readers.'

    I like to say that not every day shows a profit, but every day should make you
    smarter, which will help the bottom line in the days and weeks ahead.
