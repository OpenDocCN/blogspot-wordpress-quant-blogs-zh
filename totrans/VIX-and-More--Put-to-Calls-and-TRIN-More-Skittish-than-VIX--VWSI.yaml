    I am going to be a little more freeform with my end of week commentary, making
    it less VIX and VWSI-centric. Lately the VIX has been at best a sub-plot in the
    market turmoil and the VWSI has not generated any extreme readings, so I will
    be expanding my weekly scope to include some of my other favorite indicators:
    put to call ratios, market breadth data, TRIN numbers, etc. going forward – or
    whatever else looks to be most newsworthy.'
