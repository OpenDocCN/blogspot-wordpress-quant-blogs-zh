- en: So far, I am not impressed by the 11% move in the VIX, which is currently trading
    a little below the intra-day high of 16.87.

    to -6 and get me into the VIX options game today. At 16.77 we are currently still
    at a VWSI of 0.

- en: The larger question, at least for me, is whether the recent pattern of higher
    lows in the VIX means we are ushering a new volatility trend. So far that is what
    it looks like, but I'd like to see at least one more month of data before I jump
    to any conclusions.
