# Quantifiable Edges: VIX Closes Up For The 7th Day In A Row While SPY Is In An Uptrend

One notable bit of action is that Wednesday marked the 7th day in a row that the VIX has risen.  That is a very unusual streak.  I decided to look back at all other times the VIX had risen for 7 days in a row while SPY was above its 200ma.  Below are results of SPY assuming a 3-day holding period.

Instances are low, but so far the returns are overwhelmingly bullish.  Very little drawdown compared to both the run-up and the average trade.  This appears to be worth some consideration.
