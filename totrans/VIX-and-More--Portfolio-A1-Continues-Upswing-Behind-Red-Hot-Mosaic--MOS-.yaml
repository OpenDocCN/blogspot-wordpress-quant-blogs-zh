    of 10% or more last week, led by a 12.2% gain in [The Mosaic Company (MOS)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=mos&hl=en),
    which now sports an impressive 39.7% return in the five weeks it has been in the
    portfolio.  Also part of last week’s winning trio were [DryShips (DRYS)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=drys&hl=en)
    and [Navistar (NAVZ)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=navz&hl=en).  By the
    time the abacus was put to bed, the gap between the benchmark S&P 500 index and
    the portfolio had closed to 7.9%, the lowest margin since the mid-August plunge.  With
    a total return of -3.08 since the February 16, 2007 inception, it is beginning
    to look like the portfolio may soon be back in green.

- en: In the never ending quest for better performance (while keeping a deaf ear to
    any concerns about high turnover) this week the stock ranking system has jettisoned
    [Sanderson Farms (SFM)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=safm&hl=en) in favor
    of [Terex (TEX)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=tex&hl=en), an infrastructure
    play with significant exposure to China. A returnee, Terex was a very strong contributor
    to the portfolio [earlier in the year](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TEX).
