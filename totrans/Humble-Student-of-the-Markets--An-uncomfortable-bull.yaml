    The relative performance of industries and sectors reveal a market whose leadership

    and a "negative beta" group.

    sensitive sectors not doing better. Consider the relative performance of Consumer
    Discretionary stocks against the market. This sector is currently seeing a sideways
    consolidation after stalling out of a relative uptrend that began last August.

    that the prudent course of action would be to move his portfolio asset allocation
    to its policy weight, i.e. if the policy weight is 60% stocks and 40% bonds, then
    the portfolio should be at 60/40\.

    the market. Now, my inner investor is telling him, "I told you so." Under these
    circumstances, my inner trader is getting very, very nervous and he is tightening
    up his trailing stops. The behavior of these sectors is flashing warning signals
    that if even if this market were to rally further, the advance could be very choppy.
