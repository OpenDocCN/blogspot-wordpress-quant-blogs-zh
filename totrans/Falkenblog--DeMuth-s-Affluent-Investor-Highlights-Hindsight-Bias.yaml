    wealthy: $100k to $1 million is ''affluent'', $1MM to $10MM is ''high net worth'',

    savings, investing, and gambling, are all different shades of grey, and highlights
    that something may seem the same at one level (not spending) is very different
    at another (buying Tbills vs. lottery tickets).  Another good point is that some
    stocks, like utilities, have generated profits and dividends for decades, and
    some like Facebook are predicated on something unconventional, monetizing something
    novel. These should be thought of as totally different, yet, these are both 'stocks',
    and classed the same (FB)

    creating his narrative, that these guys were big early believers in the Frazzini
    and Pedersen model (before these guys were born), but were thwarted by regulation.
    That is, all the big players knew low beta stocks outperformed since 1969, and
    activily advocated levering up low-beta stocks. In practice, however, this aggressive
    leveraging is hardly, if ever, observed, as a result of which the volatility effect
    can persist, because people are leverage averse. That is, the big players knew
    about the low volatility investing anomaly all along (just ask them!).

    flat--not insufficiently upward sloping--but flat (at best). A flat SML doesn't
    generate a rational reach for high beta that underlies the Frazzini and Pedersen
    (and Black, Scholes, Mehrling, etc.) model, because you don't prefer the higher
    returning 1.5 beta stocks if, actually, those stocks don't generate higher returns.

    prefer them because they have higher returns means their beliefs are irrational.

    stocks have higher than expected returns, it's that their returns are higher than
    average. Just look at the performance of Acadian, Robeco, or Analytic, which have
    been running low vol funds since 2006ish.

    not applicable, such as futures, but we don''t. We also see the opposite in options,
    where the negative risk premium seems simply related to volatility. Saying this
    is consistent because investors believe they are amplifying positive returns,
    while in fact they lose something like 20% per expiration, implies an insane dichotomy
    between expectations and reality. For this reason I think Frazzini and Pedersen
    or Scholes are wrong to say this all fits in their theory, because their theory
    is based on everyone acting on a different model than they assume: maximizing
    returns personally, while assuming everyone else is maximizing variance-adjusted
    returns. Usually, the dichotomy is someone thinks everyone else is acting irrational,
    here, the agents act irrational and assume everyone else is rational.'

    or his colleagues didn't ever discuss the low volatility anomaly for 35 years
    or so, which makes me think it wasn't something they thought was important, relative
    to their other ideas over that period. For them to now insinuate they documented
    the low volatility anomaly back in the 1970's is typical post hoc rationalization
    you find in regular people.
