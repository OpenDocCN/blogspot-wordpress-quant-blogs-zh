    in them, the same way the vote for politicians who perennially suggest they can
    solve problems that the last 10 guys did not solve. Yet ultimately, they sell
    what the public demands: style funds, index funds, sector funds, analytic All
    Star funds. They suggest, as always, that talking to an investment analyst to
    ''meet one''s future needs'' magically will provide for kid''s college, or retirement,
    as if stating ''I really want $1MM in 10 years'' can make it happen. These are
    part of an inconsistent global view of alpha, or how risk relates to return, empirically,
    but never mind, the public believes in these stories.'

- en: The Quaker Small-Cap Growth Tactical Allocation Fund, launched late last year,
    now has about half its assets in cash, down from as much as 95% last year. The
    new John Hancock Technical Opportunities Fund had about 12% cash at the end of
    October and is managed using a strategy that devoted roughly 90% to cash early
    this year

- en: Unfortunately, there is less evidence that market timing is feasible than stock
    picking. Indeed, in 1960s the first tests of mutual funds took seriously the idea
    the funds added value timing the market, but it was quickly discovered there was
    nothing there. Considering that predicting the aggregate stock market has major
    data limitations (there just aren't enough stock market cycles in one's working
    life), this skill tends to be mainly marketing bluster.

    recently analyzed more than 4,000 U.S. stock funds' returns between 2000 and 2007\.
    Managers helped their performance through stock-picking, he found, but hurt their
    returns by market-timing.
