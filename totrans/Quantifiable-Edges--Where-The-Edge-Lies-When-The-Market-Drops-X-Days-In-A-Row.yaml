    I’m going to look briefly at what its meant to be down “X” number of days in terms
    of an edge for the next trading day.

    exactly X days in a row.

- en: A few things caught my eye here. The first is the % Wins column. It stayed pretty
    close to 50% no matter how many down days you’ve had. Basically a coin flip either
    way. The 2nd column that caught my eye was the Avg Win column. This is the column
    that provides an edge when you get further out. In general the more stretched
    market the stronger the bounce is likely to be.

- en: As I showed in the post that focused on 3 days down, the edge has changed over
    the years. More recently there has been a greater tendency for the market to reverse
    rather than trend. Below is the same table for the 1989 – present time frame.

- en: The % wins column here shows that the tendency to reverse after being down several
    days has grown stronger in the last 20 years. As in the 1st table, the Avg Win
    increases as the SPX gets more stretched.

    recently. Below is an equity curve for being down 5 days.

    several years.

- en: My takeaway is this. There is a long-side edge after the market has pulled back
    for several days in a row. A large part of the edge comes not from the chances
    the market will rise the next day, but the fact that you will be rewarded amply
    if it does. If you understand this and perhaps combine the fact that the market
    is down multiple days with other indications that a reversal is likely, then you
    can likely identify a strong upside edge.
