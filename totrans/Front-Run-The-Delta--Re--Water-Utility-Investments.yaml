    They treat, process, and distribute water, and collect, treat, and reuse sewage.
    I like alot of firms from or working in Brazil, namely due to their increased
    use of ethenal and the consequential development from a better economy and infrastructure.
    They are on the brink of becoming an investment-grade country, which will further
    fuel their internal development and international status. Carlyle, Riverstone,
    and Goldman have all entered Brazil this year, most notably to acquire alternate
    energy producers.

    its infrastructure, and expanding operations deeper in Sao Paulo state. 50% stake
    owned by the State of Sao Paulo doesn't hurt either. Water Utilities will continue
    to be afforded adequate rate increases by their respective regulators.

    previously, I believe we have not yet seen the bottom and am hesitant to get too
    deep into a long position at this point, but see significant long-term value in
    each of the above. More weight will be given to Basin,
