    which predict the likely percentage retracement of any preceding up or down move.  The
    details of Fibonacci retracements are discussed in [many places](http://www.swing-trade-stocks.com/fibonacci-retracements.html)
    on the web, so I won’t repeat them here other than to note that the most commonly
    used [Fibonacci numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) are the
    retracement percentages of 38.2%, 50%, and 61.8%.  When markets move sharply in
    one direction, then turn around, the first question traders tend to ask themselves
    is how long the move will last.  The usual suspects are previous closes, moving
    averages and “Fibs.”

    astrology, the important thing is that other traders do and right or wrong, they
    can make Fibs a self-fulfilling prophecy.

- en: Part of the reason I mention all of this is that the NASDAQ composite just retraced
    about 61.8% of the recent drop and now is finding resistance at the Fibonacci
    level.  The chart below tells much of this story, but the pressing question is
    what happens next.  There is a temptation to assume that the bulls will eventually
    win out once again or that this time it looks like the bears finally have the
    numbers…but there is a third possibility, that we may be entering into a trading
    range.  Once again, it is way too early to determine whether this may be the case,
    but today’s stalemate (so far) opens up that possibility.  IF we are going to
    be in a trading range for awhile, expect Fibonacci levels to play an important
    role in defining the trading range, along with the other usual suspects.

    continue to be on the high side, a [covered call (or buy-write) fund](http://www.thestreet.com/_yahoo/funds/toponepercent/10340878.html?cm_ven=YAHOO&cm_cat=FREE&cm_ite=NA),
    like market leader [BEP](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=bep), is an excellent low
    risk way to beat the market.
