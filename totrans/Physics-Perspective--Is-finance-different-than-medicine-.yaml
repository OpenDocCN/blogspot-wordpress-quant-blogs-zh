    -- risks I think are systematically underestimated by standard economic theories.
    But finance does of course bring many benefits, mostly when used in its proper
    role as a means to insure against risks. I just happened on this

    of Chicago who propose the idea of an FDA for finance -- a body that would be
    charged with approving new financial products before they would enter the market.
    It's a sensible proposal, especially given the potential risks associated with
    financial products, which are certainly comparable to the risks of new pharmaceutical
    products.

    fundamentally opposing uses of derivatives and other new financial products --
    in acting as insurance, to spread risks in a socially beneficial way, or to act
    as mechanism for gambling, to increase the risks faced by certain parties in a
    way that does not bring social benefits. The following two paragraphs give the
    flavor of the argument (which the full paper explores in great detail):'

    but when these same products are used for gambling they can instead be socially
    detrimental. The difference between insurance and gambling is that insurance enables
    people to reduce the risk they face, whereas gambling increases it. A person who
    purchases financial products in order to insure themselves essentially pays someone
    else to take a risk on her behalf. The counterparty is better able to absorb the
    risk, typically because she has a more diversified investment portfolio or owns
    assets whose value is inversely correlated with the risk taken on. By contrast,
    when a person gambles, that person exposes herself to increased net risk without
    offsetting a risk faced by a counterparty: she merely gambles in hopes of gaining
    at the expense of her counterparty or her counterparty’s regulator. As we discuss
    below, gambling may have some ancillary benefits in improving the information
    in market prices. However, it is overwhelmingly a negative-sum activity, which,
    in the aggregate, harms the people who engage in it, and which can also produce
    negative third-party effects by increasing systemic risk in the economy.'

    modern discussions of financial regulation. Before the 2008 financial crisis,
    the academic and political consensus was that financial markets should be deregulated.
    This consensus probably rested on pragmatic rather than theoretical considerations:
    the U.S. economy had grown enormously from 1980 to 2007, and this growth had taken
    place at the same time as, and seemed to be connected with, the booming financial
    sector, which was characterized by highly innovative financial practices. With
    the 2008 financial crisis, this consensus came to an end, and since then there
    has been a significant retrenchment, epitomized by the passage of the Dodd-Frank
    Act, which authorizes regulatory agencies to impose significant new regulations
    on the financial industry.'

    difficult to clean up the various messes that occur when financial products lead
    to unintended consequences. Difficult isn't an argument against doing something
    worthwhile. The paper I mentioned makes considerable effort to explore how the
    insurance benefits and the gambling costs associated with a new instrument might
    be estimated. And maybe a direct analogy to the FDA isn't the right thing at all.
    Can a panel of experts estimate the costs/benefits accurately? Maybe not. But
    there might be sensible ways to bring certain new products under scrutiny once
    they have been put into wide use. And products needn't be banned either -- merely
    regulated and their use reviewed to avoid the rapid growth of large systemic risks.
    Of course, steps were taken in the late 1990s (by Elizabeth Warren, most notably)
    to regulate derivatives markets much more closely. Those steps were quashed by
    the finance industry through the action of Larry Summers, Alan Greenspan and others.
    Had there been something like an independent FDA-like body for finance, things
    might have turned out less disastrously.

    that it goes against the tried and true Common Law notion that "anything not specifically
    banned is allowed." But that's just the point. We specifically don't allow Bayer
    or GlaxoSmithKline create and market new drugs without having extensive tests
    to give some confidence in their safety. Not only that, once approved those drugs
    can only be sold in packages containing extensive warnings of their risks. Why
    should finance be different?
