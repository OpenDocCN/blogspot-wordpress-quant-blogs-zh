- en: The stars seem to be aligning for a revival in gold prices. Prices saw a nice
    bounce today as equities weakened. The trends in other asset classes, such as
    stocks, bonds, and the US Dollar, look very stretched in the short-term and poised
    to reverse. From an inter-market analyst viewpoint, gold also seems to be in that
    camp.

- en: The chart of gold below tells the story. Bullion prices have been falling and
    they are oversold on RSI-14\. The violation of key support at the 1205-1210 zone
    has prompted high volume selling, which is indicative of investor capitulation.
    From a technical perspective, gold prices are now testing a Fibonacci retracement
    level at 1170.

    While gold prices may stage an oversold rally here, a durable bottom may not be
    in place just yet.
