hi john, i think that i would have to say that i am somewhat satisfied with performance to the extent that any reasonable alpha in the large cap space for a low turnover strategy over a long time frame is an accomplishment. while our institutional models did considerably better, they too underperformed the backtests. I think that you hit the nail on the head when you suggested that correlations were responsible. This factor has hurt all cross-sectional momentum strategies, and no one was spared. However that said, like volatility in 2008, correlations also tend to mean-revert over time, and I expect that in a few years we will see a restoration of favorable conditions once again.
good comments,
best
