# Humble Student of the Markets: Don't expect the Fed to throw another party

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2011/08/dont-expect-fed-to-throw-another-party.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2011/08/dont-expect-fed-to-throw-another-party.html#0001-01-01)

Last year, Ben Bernanke made a speech at Jackson Hole announcing the start of the Fed's QE2 program, which kicked off a stock market rally. (The Fed throws great parties, don't they?) This year, there seems to be a certain level of market expectation that we may see another Jackson Hole surprise.

Don't count on it.

**Bullard's QE3 denial**

First and foremost, James Bullard of the St. Louis Fed (an FOMC non-voter), who was one of the advocates of QE2 last year, clarified the FOMC statement that interest rates would stay low for another two years is not a signal for QE3 to start.

reported that Bullard stated:

> "The most likely outcome for the U.S. economy is still that the economy continues to grow at a moderate pace through the second half of the year,” Bullard said late yesterday in a telephone interview. “If the economy is substantially weaker than expected, we could take more action, especially if it was coupled with a renewed deflation risk.”

Second, the higher than expected

and

reports last week are not exactly comforting signals for Fed governors who are concerned about inflationary expectations.

**The worst of all worlds**

At the same time, we have signs of a decelerating economy. This long term chart of the

[ratio of coincidental to lagging indicators](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=RTCL:IND)

shows that the US economy is definitely in the danger zone.

...though this indicator did tick up this month:

Then we have the awful

print last week. David Rosenberg showed this chart of his composite of the Philly Fed and University Michigan Sentiment Index. Need I say more?

In effect, we have the worst of both worlds - the combination of a slowing economy and a Fed showing reluctance to be more accommodative than they are today. On top of that, we have European banking system and sovereigns lurching from crisis to crisis. (What's the over/under these days the for number of days before another European "problem" erupts? 2 days? 3 days?)

In the absence of effective policy response, the intermediate term path of least resistance for stocks is down.
