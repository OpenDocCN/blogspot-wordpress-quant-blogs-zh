    highlighted the utility of the bullish crossover of the monthly MACD histogram
    of the NYSE Composite Index before. In the past, such instances have signaled
    strong long-term buy phases (blue vertical lines).

    in September. As the market rallied off its recent October lows, the monthly MACD
    turned bullish again. There have been two other similar episodes of these MACD
    buy signalisakeouts. Once in 1999, and the other in 2012\. Both traced out brief
    range-bound price patterns before breaking out to new highs. If the limited past
    (n=2) is any guide, stock prices should also rally to new all-time highs in the
    near future.

  zh: 此模型在2023年6月首次发出买入信号，但MACD在9月转为负值。随着市场在最近的十月低点反弹，月度MACD再次转为看涨。这种MACD买入信号出现了两次类似的情况。一次是在1999年，另一次是在2012年。在突破新高之前，两者都形成了短暂的区间交易价格模式。如果有限的过去（n=2）是任何指引，股价也应该在不久的将来上涨至新的历史高点。
