    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    signal. A bullish Trend Model signal that gets less bullish is a trading "sell"
    signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading
    "buy" signal. The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of
    the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. Past trading of
    the trading model has shown turnover rates of about 200% per month.

    over eight years. While that may seem like a long time, bull markets don't just
    die of old age. Rather, they end as excesses build up and central bankers act
    to cool down the overheated economy.

    central bank action to cool down the economy. Will a 0.25% hike crash the market?
    How about 0.50% this year, or Fed action to reduce the size of its balance sheet?
