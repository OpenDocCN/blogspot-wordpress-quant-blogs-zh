    of businesses and consumers, worsening the economic outlook. This manufactured
    disaster-in-the-making presents the Federal Reserve with a dilemma: Should it
    mitigate the damage by providing offsetting stimulus, or refuse to play along?'

    ongoing attacks on Powell and on the institution have made that untenable. Central

    purview. After all, Trump’s reelection arguably presents a threat to the U.S.
    and global economy, to the Fed’s independence and its ability to achieve its employment
    and inflation objectives***. If the goal of monetary policy is to achieve the
    best long-term economic outcome, then Fed officials should consider how their
    decisions will affect the political outcome in 2020.'
