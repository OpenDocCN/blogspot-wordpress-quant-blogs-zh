    the Brits call ''gearing'', is the ratio of assets to equity (think Archimedes)
    I have worked a lot examining bank default models based on financial ratios, and
    how ratings, equity returns or spreads relate to leverage, and for banks there
    just is not that much there historically. Leverage, historically, is not a very
    powerful indicator of financial performance for financial institutions (it works
    for nonfinancials, however). Not that it does not matter, only that leverage ratios
    observed represent equilibrium solutions to various problems, and the residual
    cross sectional correlation is generally uninformative. The'

    financial puzzle, because the return on this trade represents a higher return
    than generated via standard utility functions. That is, the annualized Sharpe
    ratio is about 0.4, which is around what it is for the stock market, which itself
    generates the well known 'equity premium puzzle'.

    20% in the Depression (1930's), and recently experienced a 15% drawdown. One can
    imagine someone thinking the Depression is no longer a relevant benchmark, in
    which case, a 6% drawdown is a reasonable worst case scenario. Now, most investors
    apply capital of around 3 times the worst case scenario, which means, using the
    lenient 6% worst case scenario, 18% capital. The return, per year, is merely 1.4%
    annually, so a 1.4% return on 18% in capital (these are a function of par bonds
    at work) is about 7.8% return on economic capital, which is generally not a good
    investment for something with so much uncertainty. Thus, while on a Sharpe ratio
    this may seem a puzzle, given the leptokurtosis (fat downward tail) in bonds,
    one should not base the risk capital as a function of the standard deviation,
    but rather, a stress test, which in this case makes this a bad trade (alas, utility
    function theorists focus on standard deviations). The strategy makes sense for
    banks only in the context of a product that is 1) not market to market and 2)
    generates auxiliary revenue via servicing of the loan.

    levered position long high grade mortgages funded at the bank funding rate (usually
    A rating), because even if this crisis did not happen, and the BBB rated Mortgaged
    Backed Securities did not experience defaults, the mark to market from standard
    variations in the BBB-AAA spread makes it a loser for investors. I suspect many
    backed into this trade as UBS did, via first acquiring the securities to repackage
    into mezzanine securities sold at fat margins, but then were stuck with the high
    grade securities, and rationalized this as not a problem by looking at historical
    BBB default rates and ignoring the mark to market. In any case, they should have
    had a leverage ratio of 5.5:1 (1/0.18) if they want to 'arb' the AAA-BBB spread,
    so the really high leverage rates of investment banks implies they were not looking
    at the spread volatility, irrespective of default rate and housing price assumptions.

    leverage to arb some thin investment grade spread? Looking at investment bank
    leverage ratios (assets/book equity), we see that Lehman, Merril, and Bear Stearns
    were all around 30 in December 2007\. Yet, they were around these levels in 1995\.
    Sure, some, like Citi and Morgan Stanley, moved up considerably over that period,
    but these moves were the exception. Thus, in general, there was not a big increase
    in leverage, as it was confined to a handful of investment banks. Nevertheless,
    we do see a relation between leverage and stock returns. Using all US investment
    banks with market cap over $1B in 2006, and looking at stock returns from 2006
    to present, we see a modest, but significant, negative relation. Higher leverage
    implies a higher future market decline.

    they usually mean 'investment banker', which is a very different animal. Bankers
    have modest incomes, and except for the highest echelons, are not not your quintessential
    Masters of the Universe. They understand the nitty-gritty of underwriting and
    servicing loans, as opposed to trading and making deals. The leverage ratios of
    commercial banks, if anything, went down over the past decade, from an average
    of 12 to around 10\. Most banks are commercial banks, not investment banks. We
    see little relation between leverage in 2006 and subsequent stock market performance
    (using those US banks with market cap greater than $1B in 2006). This is a typical
    banking relation, where book leverage, in general, is not correlated with things
    like ratings, spreads, and other financial performance metrics.

    traded BBB rated debt were making a bad trade, and were much too highly levered
    to make this trade. This seems to explain some of the problems for these firms.
    Yet, most banks were not increasing leverage, and there is little relation between
    the leverage and future returns we see in commercial banks, as both have lost
    about 60% in market cap since 2006\. So although leverage has some relevance,
    this is a second order consideration in the big picture.
