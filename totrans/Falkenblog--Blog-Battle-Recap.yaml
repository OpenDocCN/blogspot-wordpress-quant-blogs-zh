    investors and regulators failed to do anything to rein in an out-of-control housing
    market bubble-and now we’re all still suffering from the consequences.

    government would have mitigated the boom — rather, it would have made this crisis
    worse. Indeed, it was only the collapse of the subprime market at the beginning
    of 2007 as reflected by the ABX-HE subprime housing index that alerted people
    to the severity of this problem, and shut off financing by mid-2007, six months
    later. Market prices, not legislators, instigated the end of the insanity. How
    quickly are failed governmental initiatives usually stopped, once identified?

    main priority, because a financial system built on debt is inevitably more fragile
    than one that is not. There are also lots of ways to get around and game leverage
    restrictions, though. In any case, just saying that markets are better decision
    makers than governments and leaving it at that isn’t very helpful.

    we had crises every twenty years: in 1819, 1838, 1857, 1873, 1893, and 1907\.
    After a couple of years, though, things always got better...Much regulation is
    really about preventing competition, under the guise of protecting a consumer
    from some wily salesman, so it becomes a sanctuary for scalawags. Because of regulation,
    Wal-Mart can’t offer most simple banking services'

    financial regulation is needed and (b) the belief that said regulation should
    rely on market prices and on risk formulas devised by finance professors and their
    ilk... We will have financial regulations. So they ought to take explicitly into
    account the reality that financial markets tend to overshoot.

    single agent. If you try to make it ‘better’, given the political realities of
    how rules and taxes are created, 99 percent of the time you create a counter effect
    that makes it worse, as a good idea is conflated with some targeted redistribution.

    He notes Basel is inconsistent, trying to be regulatory, and rely on market prices.
    But if you are trying to come up with capital adequacy, I don't see how you can
    do this without using all sorts of market data, because capital adequacy is a
    market issue. That is, regulators are concerned about market failure. Further,
    if you are estimating something like volatility, or value, and you ignore market
    prices, surely your estimates are arbitrary in a much less battle-tested way.
    In sum, if regulation is compromised to the extent it relies on market data, God
    help us all.
