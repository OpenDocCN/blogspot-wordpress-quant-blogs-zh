    With market conditions overbought and sentiment surveys showing high levels of
    bullishness, does this mark an intermediate term top?

    for a move to all-time highs in the S+P 500 in 2012\.

    investors were under-weight equities versus their historical average. (The figures
    have since been updated by AAII and individuals are only at their average weight.)
    These readings indicate that equity weightings have much farther to run.

    a non-scientific survey which I’d guess probably got a majority of responses from
    the retail folks about how what they were expecting in the near future. ***Less
    than 1 in 5 reported they were positioned for further gains, with rest split between
    people expecting a pullback of less than 5% and a smaller number expecting a larger
    decline.***

    bearish and the “dumb money” was significantly, though not exuberantly, bullish.
    So either sentiment has changed, I was wrong and her responses drew from the “smart
    money” crowd, or else her survey sample was distorted in some way.
