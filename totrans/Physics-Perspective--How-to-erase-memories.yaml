    of interpersonal influences, which certainly affect economic outcomes -- but its
    conclusion is quite striking regardless. Our memories: they can be easily erased
    or manipulated by social influence, by people around us simply telling us outright
    lies (or their own false recollections).'

    especially of things we've experienced first hand. Remember that huge football
    or baseball game your favourite team won or lost 10 years ago? Remember who made
    the biggest play? Our memories of these things aren't nearly as good as we think.
    Countless studies have shown that eyewitnesses are notoriously poor at remembering
    key facts accurately. A few years ago I got hold of an old recording of a Washington
    Redskins Superbowl victory from 20 years ago -- the details of which I thought
    were etched with prefect accuracy in my brain. I was stunned on watching to find
    out that I had mis-remembered who had made big plays, where they were on the field,
    when in the game the plays happened, and so on.

    of our lives too, I''m afraid, and this new set of experiments shows just how
    easily our memories can be altered by the social influence of people around us.
    The paper is very well written and doesn''t need much explanation. Micah Edelson
    and colleagues from the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel had volunteers
    watch an eyewitness documentary, and then several days later tested their ability
    to recall facts without any interference, or after being presented with memories
    as recounted by some other individuals. From their abstract:'

    studying the memory of individuals exposed to recollections of others. Participants
    exhibited a strong tendency to conform to erroneous recollections of the group,
    producing both long-lasting and temporary errors, even when their initial memory
    was strong and accurate.

    at the sites in the brain where these memory changes took place. The volunteers
    weren't merely reporting something they didn't actually remember just to fit in;
    their brains actually changed under social pressure, so they remembered something
    different.

- en: As Edelson and colleagues note, this new effect has long been discussed in the
    social psychology literature and is known as "memory conformity" -- our memories,
    like other aspects of our behaviour, conform to social pressure. As I said, I
    don't know immediately how this fits into economics and finance, but it must have
    some pretty important consequences. Conformity is certainly one mechanism by which
    all manner of social trends get started, amplified and perpetuated.

    on a third speculative property purchase -- "housing prices never go down".  I
    don't think he had done any independent research to establish this as fact. But
    he had been reading and listening to the prevailing atmosphere of ideas -- and
    his brain had been physically altered as a result.
