- en: Most of us, often, suffer from the illusion that our memories are fairly accurate,
    especially of things we've experienced first hand. Remember that huge football
    or baseball game your favourite team won or lost 10 years ago? Remember who made
    the biggest play? Our memories of these things aren't nearly as good as we think.
    Countless studies have shown that eyewitnesses are notoriously poor at remembering
    key facts accurately. A few years ago I got hold of an old recording of a Washington
    Redskins Superbowl victory from 20 years ago -- the details of which I thought
    were etched with prefect accuracy in my brain. I was stunned on watching to find
    out that I had mis-remembered who had made big plays, where they were on the field,
    when in the game the plays happened, and so on.

    -- 我认为其中的细节完美地刻在我的大脑中。当我观看时，我很震惊地发现我记错了谁做出了重大表现，他们在场上的位置，比赛中的哪些时刻发生了这些表现等等。

    of our lives too, I''m afraid, and this new set of experiments shows just how
    easily our memories can be altered by the social influence of people around us.
    The paper is very well written and doesn''t need much explanation. Micah Edelson

    watch an eyewitness documentary, and then several days later tested their ability
    to recall facts without any interference, or after being presented with memories

  zh: 在回忆体育赛事时发生的事情在我们回忆余生的其他事情时也会发生，我担心，这项新的实验恰好展示了我们的记忆如何轻易地被周围人的社会影响所改变。这篇文章写得很棒，不需要太多解释。以色列魏茨曼科学研究所的米卡·埃德elson及其同事让志愿者观看了一部目击者纪录片，然后在几天后测试他们回忆事实的能力，不受到任何干扰，或者在其他人叙述的记忆影响下。从他们的摘要中：
- en: We examined how socially induced memory errors are generated in the brain by
    studying the memory of individuals exposed to recollections of others. Participants
    exhibited a strong tendency to conform to erroneous recollections of the group,
    producing both long-lasting and temporary errors, even when their initial memory
    was strong and accurate.

- en: More profoundly, the study went on, using functional brain imaging, to look
    at the sites in the brain where these memory changes took place. The volunteers
    weren't merely reporting something they didn't actually remember just to fit in;
    their brains actually changed under social pressure, so they remembered something
    different.

- en: As Edelson and colleagues note, this new effect has long been discussed in the
    social psychology literature and is known as "memory conformity" -- our memories,
    like other aspects of our behaviour, conform to social pressure. As I said, I
    don't know immediately how this fits into economics and finance, but it must have
    some pretty important consequences. Conformity is certainly one mechanism by which
    all manner of social trends get started, amplified and perpetuated.

  zh: 正如埃德elson和同事们所提到的，这种新的效应已经在社会心理学文献中被长期讨论，并被称为“记忆顺从”——我们的记忆，像我们行为的其他方面，会顺从社会压力。如我所说，我不立即知道这如何适用于经济学和金融，但它肯定有一些非常重要的后果。顺从无疑是所有种类的社会趋势开始、放大和延续的机制之一。

    on a third speculative property purchase -- "housing prices never go down".  I

    he had been reading and listening to the prevailing atmosphere of ideas -- and
    his brain had been physically altered as a result.
