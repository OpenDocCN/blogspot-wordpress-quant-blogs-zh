- en: '**Mid-week market update:** This relief rally from last week’s lows has been
    stunning. The stock market shrugged off a hot employment report, a Middle East
    war that could set off an oil price surge, and a hot PPI print this morning to
    rise 3.5% off last week’s lows. But it may be time for a pause in the advance.
    The 5-day RSI is now in overbought territory, and the VIX Index has recycled from
    above its Bollinger Band to the 20 dma, or the middle of the band.'
