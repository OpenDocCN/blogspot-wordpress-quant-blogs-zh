# VIX and More: Implied Volatility Suggests Risk in Financials at Six Month Low

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/04/implied-volatility-suggests-risk-in.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/04/implied-volatility-suggests-risk-in.html#0001-01-01)

Just yesterday, in [Financials Struggle to Establish Momentum](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/04/financials-struggle-to-establish.html), I expressed some concern that the recent relatively weak performance of the financial sector ([XLF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLF)) did not bode well for any sustainable bull moves.  Perhaps the sector overheard me, as today the XLF is up 2% in an otherwise flat market as I type this.

While the price action is ultimately what matters most, there is more to the story than just the prices of the financial stocks.  In particular, I am watching the implied volatility of XLF, the financial sector’s [bellwether](http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2008/04/bellwether.html) ETF.  As depicted in the chart below, the implied volatility (which has a significant fear and anxiety component in it) for XLF is approaching levels not seen since the first week in November.

I consider option traders to be a fairly savvy bunch; if they think that the risk premium in the financial sector is lower than any time in the past six months, I am going to listen – and watch to see what happens to the price.
