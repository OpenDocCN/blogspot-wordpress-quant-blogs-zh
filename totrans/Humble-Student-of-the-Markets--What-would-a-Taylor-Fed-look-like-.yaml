- en: reported that Donald Trump interviewed John Taylor for the position of Fed chair
    and "Trump gushed about Taylor after his interview", as "Kevin Warsh has...seen
    his star fade within the White House". The current list of leading candidates
    under consider are said to be Jerome Powell, John Taylor, Kevin Warsh, and Janet
    Yellen. Taylor's rise in the candidate stakes is a bit of a surprise, as he had
    been regarded as a dark horse.

- en: Taylor is famous for the "Taylor Rule", which is a rules-based method of determining
    the Fed Funds rate. The rules-based approach is a favorite of the Republican audit-the-Fed
    crowd, and therefore Taylor will have substantial support should he get nominated.
    The standard application of the Taylor Rule would see the Fed Funds target substantially
    higher than it is today.

    Committee, which currently numbers 16 participants, is why investors need not
    worry too much about Chairman Taylor leading the Fed onto a much faster rate-hike
    path than the three rate increases next year penciled in by officials in quarterly
    forecasts updated in September.

    by the prescriptions of his original rule,” said Roberto Perli, a partner at Cornerstone
    Macro LLC in Washington. “In fact, he won’t be able to persuade hardly anyone
    -- there isn’t much sympathy in the FOMC for a policy that blindly follows rules.”

    in the Wall Street Journal explaining that forcing the Federal Open Market Committee
    (FOMC) to mechanically follow a rule, such as the Taylor rule, to set interest
    rates can cause tremendous harm to the economy and the American people. My staff
    at the Minneapolis Fed estimates that if the FOMC had followed the Taylor rule
    over the past five years, 2.5 million more Americans would be out of work today.
    That’s enough to fill the seats at all 31 NFL stadiums simultaneously, almost
    6,000 more people out of work in every congressional district.
