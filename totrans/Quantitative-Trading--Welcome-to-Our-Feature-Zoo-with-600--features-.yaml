- en: This has been a summer of feature engineering for PredictNow.ai. First, we launched
    the US stock [cross-sectional](https://www.predictnow.ai/blog/introducing-pre-engineered-stock-fundamental-features-at-predictnow-ai/)
    features and the [time-series](https://www.predictnow.ai/blog/metalabeling-and-the-duality-between-cross-sectional-and-time-series-factors/)
    market-wide features. Now we have launched the features based on options activities,
    ETFs, futures, and macroeconomic indicators. In total, we are now offering 616
    ready-made features to our subscribers.

    - is a normalized measure of the net delta imbalance between the put and call
    options of a traded instrument across its entire option chain, calculated at the
    market close for contracts of all maturities. This indicator was invented by Lily
    Francus (Twitter: @nope_its_lily) and is normalized with the total traded volume
    of the underlying instrument. The imbalance estimates the amount of delta hedging
    by market markers needed to keep their positions delta-neutral. This hedging causes
    price movement in the underlying, which NOPE should ideally capture. The data
    for this has been sourced from [Delta Neutral](http://www.deltaneutral.com/).and
    the instrument we applied it to was SPY ETF options. The SPX index options were’t
    used because the daily traded volume of the underlying SPX index “stock” was irrational.
    It was calculated as the traded volume of the constituents of the index.'

- en: Canary - is an indicator that acts similar to a  canary in a coal mine, which
    will raise an alarm when there’s an impending danger. This indicator comes from
    the dual momentum strategies of [Vigilant](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4087925-breadth-momentum-and-vigilant-asset-allocation)
    and [Defensive Asset allocation](https://indexswingtrader.blogspot.com/2018/07/announcing-defensive-asset-allocation.html).
    The canary value can be either 0,1 or 2\. This is a daily measure of which of
    the two bond or stock ETFs has a negative absolute momentum - 1) BND - Vanguard
    Total Bond Market ETF  2) VMO - Vanguard Emerging Markets Stock Index Fund ETF.
    The momentum is calculated using the 13612W method where we take a proportionally
    weighted average of percentage change in the bond/stock ETF returns in the last
    1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year. In the paper, the values of “0”,”1” or
    “2” of the canary portfolio represent what percentage of the canary is bullish.
    This indicates  what proportion of the asset portfolio was allocated to global
    risky assets (equity, bond and commodity ETFs) and what proportion was allocated
    to cash. For example, a “2” would imply 100% cash or cash equivalents, while a
    “0” would imply 100% allocation to the global risky assets. Alternatively, a value
    of “1” would imply 50% allocation to global risky assets and 50% to cash.

    defined a carry feature as, “the return on a futures position when the price stays
    constant over the holding period”. (It is also called “roll yield” or “convenience
    yield”.) We calculate carry for 1) global equities - calculated as a ratio of
    expected dividend and daily close prices; 2) SPX futures - calculated from price
    of front month SPX futures contract and spot price of the index; and3) Currency
    -  calculated from the two nearest months futures data.

- en: Pricing factors can be extracted as the principal components of the cross-section
    of treasury yields i.e. these factors are linear combinations of the treasury
    yields. The first three PCs have been prime candidates in this regard as they
    generally explain over 99% of the variability in the term structure of bond yields
    and, due to their loadings, may be interpreted as the level, slope and curvature
    factor. More can be explored in the paper, [Equity tail risk in the treasury bond
    market](https://www.sipotra.it/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Equity-tail-risk-in-the-treasury-bond-market.pdf).

    interest rates to deviate from the expected path. This is sourced from the FRED.
    The methodology for the term structure model used to calculate term premia is
    covered in the paper, [Three-Factor Nominal Term Structure Model](https://www.federalreserve.gov/data/three-factor-nominal-term-structure-model.htm).
    All the term premia features are daily percentage changes, to make them stationary.

    and over many transactions in that period to create a more robust measure. It’s
    also positively correlated with the price movement. This feature is calculated
    using tick data from Algoseek with aggressor tags (which flag the trade as a buy
    or sell market order). The data is time-stamped at milliseconds. We aggregate
    the tick-based order flow to form order flow per minute.

- en: With the 616 features PredictNow.ai  has developed for  our subscribers, applying
    machine learning to risk management and portfolio optimization is easier than
    ever , especially given our built-in financial machine learning API. Our [features
    importance ranking and selection function](https://www.predictnow.ai/blog/the-amazing-efficacy-of-cluster-based-feature-selection/)
    can indicate which of our  features are most important to predict a user’s portfolio
    or strategy’s return, so there’s no need to spend hours deciding on which features
    to include. . Ideally, a user  will also merge them with their own proprietary
    features to improve predictive accuracy. If you have any questions or would like
    to learn more about these features, download our detailed user manual [here](https://py.predictnow.ai/get_manual/),
    or book a live demo and chat with one of our consultants [here](https://www.predictnow.ai/contact/).
