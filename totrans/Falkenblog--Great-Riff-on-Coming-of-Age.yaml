    Nothing in them has a fixed shape, nothing a fixed price; everything is a possibility,
    and we live happily on credit. There are no obligations to be observed; there
    are no accounts to be kept. Nothing is specified in advance; everything is what
    can be made of it. The world is a mirror in which we seek the reflection of our
    own desires. The allure of violent emotions is irresistible. When we are young
    we are not disposed to make concessions to the world; we never feel the balance
    of a thing in our hands—unless it be a cricket bat. … Since life is a dream, we
    argue (with plausible but erroneous logic) that politics must be an encounter
    of dreams, in which we hope to impose our own.

    things, to feel the balance of things in one's hands...these are difficult achievements;
    and they are achievments not to be looked for in the young.

    a lot of insecurity in youth, when one does not know if one is on the right track.
