# VIX and More: FXP Is Here

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/11/fxp-is-here.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/11/fxp-is-here.html#0001-01-01)

Talk about a timely launch!

As I mentioned [last week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/11/whats-in-fxi.html), FXP, the double inverse of the [iShares FTSE/Xinhua China 25 Index (FXI)](http://www.ishares.com/fund_info/detail.jhtml?investorType=INDIV&symbol=FXI&qt=FXI&_requestid=41515), has begun trading today. FXP is already showing up in [Yahoo Finance](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=fxp), but has yet to appear in Google Finance.

Already showing some liquidity, FXP has traded 70,000 shares in the first 50 minutes. Watch the price and the volume on this one.
