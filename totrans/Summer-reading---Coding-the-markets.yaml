- en: Over the summer I’ve been reading “Invisible Engines” by Evans et al. Strongly
    recommended for all with an interest in the software business. It’s prompted me
    into a re-reading of Charles Ferguson’s extraordinary “High Stakes, No Prisoners”,
    which I’m enjoying even more than the first time. Ferguson’s book was written
    in 99 about events that took place five years previously. From the vantage point
    of 2007 it seems even more insightful.
