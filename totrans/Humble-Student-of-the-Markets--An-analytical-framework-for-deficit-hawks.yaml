    the combination of austerity, a bull market and the decision not to go overboard
    on military expenditures. Recall that at the end of the Clinton era, both the
    American and Canadian fiscal budgets were in surplus, artificially buoyed by capital
    gains from the Tech Bubble market. In the wake of 9/11, the US embarked on a series
    of military adventures and keeled over into deficit, while Canada only made a
    limited commitment and remained in surplus for a few more years.

    ratios of Europe, Japan and the United States for the next 30 years. The red dotted
    line depicts the baseline scenario, which assumes that assume that government
    total revenue and non-age-related primary spending remain a constant percentage
    of GDP at the 2011 OECD projected levels. The green line assumes budget cuts of
    1% of GDP for five years starting in 2012\. The blue line assumes deeper cuts
    to entitlement programs, e.g. pension benefits, etc.

    in all three scenarios. By contrast, the announced German cuts amount to about
    0.7% of GDP per year for the next four years, which falls short of the BIS projection
    of 1% of GDP.

    that burden all of us. However, things become much clearer once we use the analytical
