    Lewis’  Flash Boys.

    Boys.

- en: The paper offers an incredible view of the players and their effects in the
    E-mini S&P 500 futures contract.   The data was so good that I just had to unlock
    the data from their tables.  By far my favorite table was table 7 with “the decomposition
    of average daily short-term profits among different trader types in August 2010.” 
    The profits are given as average daily $ profit and profit per trade per contract. 
    The [d3 chord layout](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Chord-Layout) seemed
    perfect to visualize this data.  Fortunately, Ben Hunter had just blogged about
    his custom rCharts implementation of the chord layout in [Chord Diagram with rCharts](http://mostlyconjecture.com/2014/05/03/chord-diagrams-with-rcharts/). 
    In beautiful open source fashion, I was able to adapt it and quickly view the
    data as below.  I am not sure how exactly it ties to Flash Boys, but I am guessing
    that this lends some credibilty to the story.  Just look at the miserable losses
    of “Small Traders”.

    versions.  I will admit that I spent little time customizing any of the charts
    above or below.  I will save that for later.
