    bearish. As well, there were worrisome signs from the credit market. I want to
    address the latter issue, as cross-asset, or inter-market, analysis signals are
    something that I pay special attention to.

    referred to as junk bonds, these debt securities are issued by companies with
    low credit quality. Because of the higher risks that come with lending to such
    companies, they have to offer higher yields than those of their investment-grade
    peers. When spreads increase, it's costing more for these junk corporates to borrow.

    distress in Energy, to risks of weakening global growth, to significant uncertainty
    around Fed rate hikes," Morgan Stanley''s Adam Richmond said on Friday. "As a
    result, HY just posted the weakest four-month stretch (Jun-Sep) since the end
    of 2008, -7.03% in total return. This selloff has driven very negative sentiment,
    as nothing brings the bears out of hiding more so than low prices, feeding into
    panicky price action in markets."'

    the time of the Lehman Crisis. We can see a positive divergence at the March 2009
    low as HY spreads were tighter than they were at the time of the first spike.
    But then, that effect was somewhat predictable as the fiscal and monetary authorities
    were taking steps to ride to the rescue, so you would expect credit spreads to
    begin to narrow.

    (or lows as the chart is inverted) at the final stock market's  final low. In
    other words, HY was showing a negative divergence at the equity market bottom.

    The evidence is inconclusive. It seems that credit move approximately in-line
    with stock prices. The credit market represents a useful indicator of cross-asset
    risk appetite and it can warn or confirm bull and bear trends. Both positive and
    negative divergences need to be confirmed by other indicators. By itself, rising
    credit spreads is a red herring and tell us nothing about where stock prices are
    going.
