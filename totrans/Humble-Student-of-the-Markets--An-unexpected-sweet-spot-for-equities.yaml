    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    next for the stock market? To be sure, stock prices are no longer cheap. FactSet
    reports that the market is trading at a forward P/E ratio of 16.7, which is just
    above its 5-year average of 16.3 and well above its 10-year average of 14.7.
