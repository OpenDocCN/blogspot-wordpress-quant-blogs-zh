# Magmasystems Blog: Streambase On The Move?

> 来源：[http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2009/02/streambase-on-move.html#0001-01-01](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2009/02/streambase-on-move.html#0001-01-01)

Mark Palmer seems to be

[turning Streambase in a positive direction](http://streambase.typepad.com/streambase_stream_process/2009/02/5-observations-about-phasecapitals-selection-of-cep.html)

since he joined .... either that, or the Streambase marketing machine is in full throttle.

Remarkably, Mark has managed to get testimonials from a number of financial services customers. Usually we are a secretive bunch, and many of the larger financial institutions do not like to have themselves used as a reference customer. Which makes it all the more interesting that Streambase has been able to persuade these customers to go public. Not only that, but Streambase has managed to convince Penny Crossman of Wall Street and Technology to rewrite their press release into an

.

Say what you will about Streambase's sales and marketing staff .... they have proven themselves to be amazingly effective. They have been able to trot out customer references, whereas Coral8 and Aleri have not. This gives the

perception

that Streambase is eating the competition, whether that perception is true or not.

Mark posted an interesting paragraph:

As Dr. Goodell described, Apama didn't even make the ***first cut*** in their evaluation. On the other hand, Aleri, the other final CEP product in PhaseCapital's evaluation, fared well with its high-performance, multi-threaded server architecture.

And, Penny follows it up with:

PhaseCapital evaluated a number of CEP vendors in the trading space, including [Progress Apama](http://www.progress.com/apama), [Coral8](http://www.coral8.com/), [Aleri](http://www.aleri.com/) and [StreamBase](http://www.streambase.com/).

It's very interesting that Phase Capital found that Aleri was the highest performing CEP engine. This has confirmed something that I have suspected. Aleri has always been touting themselves as the most performant of the CEP engines, and has welcomed the other CEP vendors to take the Aleri Challenge. However, it may have been the lack of spit-and-polish in Aleri's development environment that may have sunk it. I have previously blogged here that I thought that Streambase had the best development experience and documentation out of all of the other products.

I am wondering what factors caused Phase Capital to not choose Coral8\. One thing that Streambase has that most of the others do not is built-in adapters for trading companies. As Penny writes:

StreamBase already had an adaptor for the QuickFIX engine as well as adaptors for the data streams provide by Lime Brokerage, PhaseCapital's execution broker. "The building blocks were very complementary to what we're ultimately trying to deploy," Pritchett says.

I have been saying this for a long long time on this blog --- the quality of the CEP engine does not matter as much as the entire ecosystem surrounding the CEP engine. You can have the best, fastest, most expressive CEP engine and language, but if you don't surround it with a compelling ecosystem, then you are sunk. And, Mark Palmer understands this.
