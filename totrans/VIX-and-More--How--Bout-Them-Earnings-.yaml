    has [a surprising statistic](http://bespokeinvest.typepad.com/bespoke/2008/07/sp-500-earnings.html)
    out this morning: with 11% of the S&P 500 companies reporting, Bespoke has calculated
    the current quarter''s EPS beat rate to be 72%. There are a lot of earnings reports
    still to come, but if it holds, the 72% beat rate will be the second highest in
    the past decade.'

    have already reported are in the financial sector, which has to be considered
    among the most earnings challenged in the current environment.
