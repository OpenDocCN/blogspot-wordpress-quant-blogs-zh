    Large gaps are often seen as fading opportunities by traders. This is due to the
    propensity of the market to reverse gaps.

    on gaps up of 1% up or greater depended largely upon the action leading up to
    the gap. I have found a similar dependency when looking at gaps down.'

    it gaps lower by 1% or more and HASN’T closed higher for 2 days in a row. The
    trade is exited at the close of the day. As you can see, reversals are slightly
    favored and the net expectation is for further upside. (1998-present.)

    An overbought market that gaps down big tends to sell off further. Below is an
    equity curve of the system.

    risks by a large degree. Of course since Monday’s potential gap down would be
    coming after two up days, the net expectation would favor more downside.

    Gaps are no exception.
