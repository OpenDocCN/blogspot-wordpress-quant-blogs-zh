- en: Hi, one of our quant-oriented readers whose nickname is coincidentally “Quant”
    made a great suggestion regarding my suggested refinement. Quant says that instead
    of eliminating outlier values (above the 95th and below the 5th percentile by
    range) I should at least account for them by giving them a maximum or minimum
    value.  The distortion created by eliminating them entirely would have less effect
    with a long moving average and a stock index, but with individual stocks and shorter
    moving averages this poses a problem. Along this line, I propose giving outlier
    values a maximum value that corresponds to the 80th percentile, and a minimum
    value that corresponds to the 20th percentile. In the future I will also discuss
    the importance of making these adjustments for more recent data vs past data.
