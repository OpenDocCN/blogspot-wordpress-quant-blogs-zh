  zh: 报告说现在人民币存在贬值压力：
- en: In recent days, however, something else has happened that potentially has far
    more serious implications. For the past decade, China has run surpluses on both
    its current and capital account. When it comes to both trade and investment, China
    is a net importer of foreign currency, which places pressure on its own currency
    to appreciate in order to resolve the imbalance. China has prevented the RMB from
    appreciating more rapidly than it desires by fixing a price at which it buys dollars
    (and other foreign currency) and stockpiles them as official reserves. Because
    that price has always been fixed below the market equilibrium point (the RMB has
    been kept undervalued), whatever limited trading band was set, the RMB tended
    to bump up against the upper limit. In other words, the RMB was a one-way bet,
    always under pressure to appreciate against the dollar.

  zh: 然而，在最近几天，发生了另外一些可能具有更严重含义的事情。过去十年中，中国在其经常账户和资本账户上均实现了顺差。在贸易和投资方面，中国是外国货币的净进口国，这使得对其货币升值以解决失衡的压力增大。中国通过设定购买美元（和其他外币）的价格并将其作为官方储备囤积，防止人民币升值过快。因为那个价格总是定在市场均衡点之下（人民币被低估），无论设定了多么有限的交易区间，人民币倾向于触及上限。换句话说，人民币是一种单向赌注，总是承受着对美元升值的压力。

    the trading band](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204138204576602292247397816.html),
    implying that the RMB wanted to depreciate against the dollar. Why? Presumably
    because the capital account had flipped, and speculators were now rushing to turn
    their RMB into dollars in order to take their money out of China. It’s important
    to clarify what this does and does not mean. It does not mean that the RMB is
    now suddenly going to collapse in value. China holds US$3 trillion in currency
    reserves, and can deploy those reserves to support any exchange rate it wishes.
    Even if China were tempted to devalue (at the cost, it should be noted, of fanning
    inflation), the mounting political pressure in the U.S. Senate to take action
    against China for its undervalued currency would pose an obstacle to pursuing
    that path.

  zh: 直到本周，当人民币开始[触及交易区间的下限](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204138204576602292247397816.html)，暗示人民币相对于美元存在贬值愿望。为什么？可能是因为资本账户已经反转，现在投机者正急于将他们的人民币兑换成美元，以将他们的钱从中国撤出。重要的是要澄清这到底意味着什么，以及这并不意味着什么。这并不意味着人民币现在突然会大幅贬值。中国持有3万亿美元的货币储备，可以动用这些储备来支持任何它希望的汇率。即使中国受到诱惑要贬值（请注意，这将加剧通货膨胀），美国参议院日益增长的政治压力要求对中国低估的货币采取行动，这将阻碍走这条路。

    a hard landing in China. US policymakers need to be aware of market forces. Otherwise,
    they risk the path of Smoot-Hawley, which served to exacerbate the downturn during
    the Great Depression.
