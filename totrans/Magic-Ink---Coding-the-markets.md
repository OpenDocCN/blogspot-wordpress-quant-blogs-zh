## Magic Ink

### March 1, 2012

Thanks to [reddit](http://www.reddit.com) I’ve just discovered [Bret Victor](http://worrydream.com). I watched the [Invention](http://vimeo.com/36579366) video, and enjoyed the whole theme on tightening the feedback loop between changing code and seeing results. The later part on moral crusading was interesting if not entirely convincing. So I checked out the web site, and am reading [Magic Ink](http://worrydream.com/MagicInk/). Wow ! This is a full blown vision of doing software differently. Back in the 90s I got really excited by, in turn, [Brad Cox’s vision](http://virtualschool.edu/cox/pub/PSIR/), [Patterns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns), and [Open Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar). About 10 years ago I discovered dynamically typed languages with Python and Smalltalk. And that’s the last time I had a real rush of excitement about some new approach in software. Sure, I’ve dabbled in functional languages like F#, and played with various OSS projects. But for the most part my attention has been on the trading topics that fascinate me, like electronic limit order books.

So what’s Magic Ink about ?  Victor divides software into three categories: information, manipulation and communication software. He focuses on information software, which is most apps really. And that includes most financial and trading apps. And then he proceeds to argue that there’s too much interactivity, and that interaction is bad. The way forward is context sensitivity combined with history and graphic design. Counterintuitive, and utterly convincing. A joy to read !

I can’t help wondering what the [UX crew](http://blog.caplin.com/author/duncanbcaplincom/) over at [Caplin](http://www.caplin.com) think of this ?  I [haven’t seen them blogging](http://blog.caplin.com/) on it. Victor’s views have radical implications for how etrading apps should work. I’d expect [Sean Park](http://www.parkparadigm.com) to be pushing this angle with his portfolio companies too…
