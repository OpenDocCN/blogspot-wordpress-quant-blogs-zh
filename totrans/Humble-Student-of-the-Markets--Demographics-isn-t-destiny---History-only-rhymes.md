# Humble Student of the Markets: Demographics isn't destiny = History only rhymes

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2019/02/demographics-isnt-destiny-history-only.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2019/02/demographics-isnt-destiny-history-only.html#0001-01-01)

As new data has crosses my desk, I thought I would write a follow-up to my bullish demographic analysis published two weeks ago (see

[A different kind of America First](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2019/01/20/a-different-kind-of-america-first/)

). To recap, I observed that America is about to enter another echo demographic boom as the Millennial generation enters its prime earnings years.

A

[study by San Francisco Fed researchers](https://www.frbsf.org/our-district/about/sf-fed-blog/boomer-retirement-weighing-down-us-equity-markets/)

 pointed out that this should raise demand for equities from Millennials. This is especially important as the Baby Boomers reduce their equity holdings as they retire.

I then postulated that rising savings from Millennial should usher in another golden age in US equities.

This is the part where history doesn't repeat itself, but rhymes.

**A Special Announcement**

We told you so. We told you the market was going down.

Here is the track of

***Humble Student of the Markets***

, where we are neither perma-bulls nor perma-bears. Most recently, we have been correctly bullish since the correction of 2015, and turned cautious in August 2018 (see

[Market top ahead? My inner investor turns cautious,](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2018/08/05/major-top-ahead-my-inner-investor-turns-cautious/)

August 5, 2018).

We were also timely at the 2009 bottom. We issued a call to buy beaten up low-priced stocks with high insider buying a week before the ultimate bottom (see

[Phoenix rising?](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2009/02/phoenix-rising.html)

 February 24, 2009).

***The out-of-sample record of our model trading portfolio in 2018 was up 42.9%***
