    a hierarchical society with a strong pretense for egalitarianism. Rich people
    have more friends, bigger birthday parties, etc. But once you lose everything,
    you suddenly aren't as funny, as friendworthy, as desirable.

    in circumference. That he was now pointing it out to me was telling. It clearly
    caused him great angst. I wanted to be careful how I responded. Men and their
    penises have a strange and unique relationship...[However] I liked this man and
    didn’t want to emasculate him. His tiny penis hadn’t prevented me from climaxing...On
    the bright side, oral sex would be a breeze.
