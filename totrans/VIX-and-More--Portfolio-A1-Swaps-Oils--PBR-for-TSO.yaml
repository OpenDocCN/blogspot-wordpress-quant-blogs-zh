    aspects of a fully mechanical trading system is sitting on the sidelines trying
    to get up the enthusiasm to root for stock that you wouldn’t otherwise follow.  Rarely
    do I watch Portfolio A1 dump one stock in favor of another, pump my fist in the
    air and yell at my monitor, “It’s about time, dammit!”  Today is one of those
    days, however, as I can let my lukewarm feelings about the refiner [Tesoro (TSO)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=tso&hl=en)
    depart along with the stock, while at the same time welcome into the Portfolio
    A1 fold [Petroleo Brasileiro (PBR)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=pbr&hl=en),
    the state-owned Brazilian whose stock has traced almost a straight line over the
    past five years in rising from 5 to 65, all while generally paying a 2% dividend
    in the process.  PBR has been a favorite of my discretionary portfolios for several
    years and I can only hope that it hasn’t gotten ahead of itself at this stage.

    [Mobile TeleSystems OJSC (MBT)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=mbt&hl=en),
    whose 7.5% weekly gain helped to more than double the portfolio’s advantage over
    the benchmark S&P 500 from 1.5% to 3.3%.  With Russia and now Brazil, 2/5 of the
    portfolio is invested in ADRs; and when you consider that portfolio stalwart [Terex
    (TEX)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=tex&hl=en) has a strong China component,
    it is worth noting that Portfolio A1's stock ranking system is unwittingly endorsing
    the [BRIC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRIC) growth thesis, albeit with limited
    exposure to India.

    as <place st="on"><city st="on">PBR</city>, <state st="on">TEX</state></place>
    and [AMKR](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=amkr&hl=en) are concerned, it will
    be interesting to see if Portfolio A1’s performance changes dramatically, for
    better or for worse.
