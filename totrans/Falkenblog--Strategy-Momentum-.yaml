- en: A big hedge fund is known for hiring a lot of traders, giving them each a small
    amount of capital, and then firing them when they lose, say, 5% of their capital.
    With this rule, they are basically running a strategy momentum portfolio. I know
    the fund is very successful, with about 140 traders at any time and getting rid
    of 25% or more each year. They have several billion dollars under management.

  zh: 一家大型对冲基金以雇佣大量交易员而闻名，给他们每人少量的资本，然后在他们亏损达到资本的5%时将他们辞退。按照这个规则，他们基本上正在运营一个策略动量投资组合。我知道这个基金非常成功，每年有大约140名交易员，并且每年淘汰掉25%或更多的交易员。他们管理着几十亿美元的资产。
- en: 'I''m not sure, however, this is all a smokescreen. They could make all their
    money doing some basic strategies, and the 100+ traders coming and going acts
    as camouflage. But any firm I have known implements a capital rule along similar
    lines: if you make money, you get more capital, if you lose, you get less. For
    most traders just starting out, this basically means you will be at 10x next year,
    or out. This make perfect sense if you think their profits are a function of their
    alpha plus the specific strategy return, which is often difficult for outsiders
    to see. Nevertheless, the result is pretty straightforward. It is conceivable
    that momentum in strategies is strong, and only a hedge fund, with its unlimited,
    discretionary, and secretive scope, can avail itself to it.'

  zh: 我不太确定，但是这一切都是在掩护之下。他们可能通过一些基本的策略赚到所有的钱，而来来去去的100多个交易员只起到了掩饰的作用。但我所知道的任何一家公司都会执行类似的资金规则：如果你赚钱，你会得到更多的资金，如果你亏钱，你会得到更少。对于大多数刚入行的交易员来说，这基本上意味着你明年可能会得到10倍的资金，否则就会被淘汰。如果你认为他们的利润是他们的alpha和特定策略回报的功能，这通常是外人难以理解的。然而，结果是非常直接的。可以想象的是，策略的动量很大，只有一个对冲基金，凭借其无限的自由和秘密性，才能利用它。
- en: Actual strategies usually are not nearly as homogeneous as those reflected by
    standard hedge fund indices (converts, distressed, long/short), but much more
    heterogeneous. Think of them as factor bets within asset classes. Further the
    factors are not simply macro factors like the market, or size, but also correlations,
    dispersion, credit spreads, mean reversion. The asset class/factor combinations
    are many. Thus, this 'strategy momentum' strategy would be difficult to test academically.
    But if it does work, it gives large, multistrat hedge funds a big advantage. Their
    only disadvantage is that there is a large amount of operational risk with such
    comings and goings, and from a PR perspective, it sounds horrible. Rarely does
    a multistrat ever admit to actually doing this, they merely say they are doing
    individual analysis all the time. That many (most) asset managers basically allocate
    capital using the rule, 'did you make money last year?', is perhaps why hedge
    funds seem to generate positive alpha in contrast to long-only mutual funds (such
    funds don't have access to near the same scope of strategies).

  zh: '实际策略通常并不像标准对冲基金指数（可转换债券、困境债券、多空）所反映的那样单一，而是更加多样化。把它们看作是资产类别中的因子投注。此外，这些因子不仅仅是市场、规模之类的宏观因素，还有相关性、离散度、信贷利差、均值回归等。资产类别/因子组合有很多。因此，这种“策略动量”策略在学术上可能很难进行测试。但如果有效，它将给大型的、多策略对冲基金带来巨大的优势。他们唯一的劣势就是这种来来去去会带来大量的运营风险，从公关角度来看，这听起来很可怕。很少有多策略对冲基金承认他们确实这样做了，他们只是说他们一直在进行个别分析。许多（大多数）资产管理公司基本上是按照这样的规则来分配资本的，“你去年赚钱了吗？”，这也许就是为什么对冲基金似乎产生了正的alpha而长仓共同基金（此类基金没有接近相同范围的策略）没有。 '
