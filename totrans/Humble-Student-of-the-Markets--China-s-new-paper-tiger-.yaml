    sales of goods to foreign buyers. Under China’s closed capital account, the exporter
    is required to sell the $100 to the central bank at prevailing exchange rates,
    which currently equals approximately 600 renminbi in domestic currency. The central
    bank then invests its $100 in foreign assets, say U.S. Treasury bonds. If the
    central bank did nothing further, then China’s money supply would go up by 600
    renminbi. To avoid inflation, the central bank sterilizes the transaction, that
    is, it withdraws 600 renminbi from circulation by selling domestic assets worth
    that amount and retiring the proceeds.

    Of course, the process isn't perfect and there is a negative carry to the process
    under a closed capital account and fixed exchange rate regime. When Chinese domestic
    interest rates are higher than US rates, it encourages a long RMB-short USD carry
    trade and, under a floating exchange rate system, the RMB should

    the U.S. Treasury bond? In that case, the central bank exchanges a higher-yielding
    asset for a lower-yielding asset, posting a loss. Thus, the PBOC faces a tradeoff.
    It either takes a loss from sterilization or it risks increasing inflation by
    expanding the money supply. Importantly, this tradeoff only happens under a closed
    capital account regime in which exporters can’t hold foreign assets.

    its banking system, Chinese borrowers would be able to exploit China’s excellent
    external credit ratings, its huge foreign exchange reserves, and the residual
    global excitement over China’s unlimited economic potential, to turn to foreign
    creditors to raise money. It would be easy for Chinese borrowers to fund domestic
    projects with foreign money.

    constraints were a consequence of poor investment decisions, the “correct” resolution
    of the problem was to constrain investment and redirect it into more productive,
    if less politically popular, projects, not to open new avenues of credit creation
    for the same old borrowers. The latter would only lead to even greater hidden
    losses and what is more would increase China’s vulnerability to foreign capital
    markets, perhaps even subjecting China to the risk of a “sudden stop” in foreign
    lending.

    in China. My sense is that foreign debt has risen quickly in the last year, but
    is probably only equal to roughly one-quarter of reserves, which is a fairly “safe”
    level. In fact I have no doubt that China specialists on the sell side will assure
    investors that it is silly to worry about foreign debt at all – just as they assured
    investors four and five years ago that it was silly to worry about domestic debt.

    but theory-poor analyses failed to understand the dynamics of the Chinese growth
    model during President Hu’s administration (2003-13) and there is little evidence
    even today that they fully understand the causes of the debt problem which, at
    least, they now readily recognize. Even a decade ago it should have been obvious
    that growth in China required mechanisms that severely unbalanced the economy
    and forced debt up faster than debt servicing capacity.
