    stocks hitting new 52-week lows. Rather than just looking at 52-week lows, I typically
    like to look at the differential of highs and lows. As with many of the indicators
    I use, I believe it’s important to normalize the results when looking over long
    time periods. (

- en: '.) For this indicator the need to normalize springs from the fact that the
    total issues trading on the NYSE is significantly greater now than it was in the
    1970’s and early 80''s. Therefore I divide the raw result by the number of issues
    outstanding to get a percent figure. The total result on Friday was a net of 757
    or just over 23% of the total issues traded on the NYSE. Here’s an example of
    two tests that demonstrates how results would vary greatly if you fail to adjust
    for the total issues trading:'

    first test. Many more instances are found here when looking back to the 70's and
    80's. By using raw numbers instead of normalizing them, you’d be missing out on
    almost half the pertinent data.
