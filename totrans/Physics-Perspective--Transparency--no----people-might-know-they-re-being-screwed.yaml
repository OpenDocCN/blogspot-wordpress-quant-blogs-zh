    charges on credit cards should NOT be transparent to the customer because the
    customer might then feel cheated, become angry and upset, etc. Better if those
    charges were lumped into the bulk price of the purchase so the buyer won''t know
    what the bank is charging. Don''t upset people with things like this:'

    fees opaquely.  These fees are applied throughout the process, and the lack of

    charge where the bank fees are hidden, rather than seeing the fees per transaction
    itemised explicitly.

    company charging the fee might think twice about my reaction to it. What do others
    think?
