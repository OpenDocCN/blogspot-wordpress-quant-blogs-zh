- en: Microsoft came in the other day and showed some Silverlight and WPF demos. Infusion
    Development wrote a demo of a vol surface viewer (not an editor). According to
    the guys from MSFT, you can actually embed the WPF control within a .NET 2.0 Winforms
    app.

    would be interesting to see how a WPF vol surface/curve editor would compare,
    especially when the CPU is busy handlign feeds and calculating greeks.
