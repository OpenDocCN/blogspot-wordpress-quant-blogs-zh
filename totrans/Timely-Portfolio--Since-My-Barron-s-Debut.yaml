    in an article titled “Bears Beware.”](http://online.barrons.com/article/SB50001424053111903697804575574310818799270.html#articleTabs_panel_article%3D1) 
    Commenters on Twitter and blogs everywhere cited this as a perfect “Cover Story”
    indicator to exit the stock market.  This article was also my Barron’s debut

    manager for Sterne Agee. "They are severely overvalued. The only way a bond investment
    works at current yields is if we''re in a depression. Some ugly things [would]
    have to come true."'

    balance sheets. The most bullish Big Money participant, he predicts the Dow will
    reach 14,000 by mid-2011, with the S&P rising to 1,300 and the Nasdaq to 2,500\.
    Investors have abandoned risk "precisely at the time they should be taking risks,"
    he says.

- en: Unfortunately though, I think the move in stocks is almost done just as my targets
    are reached 5 months early, so I’m not sure it counts.  I would love to see the
    poll now.  My guess is it would be much different with many more aggressive bulls
    and with me as a bear.
