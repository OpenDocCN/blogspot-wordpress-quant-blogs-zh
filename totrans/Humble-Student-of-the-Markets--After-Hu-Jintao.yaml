    that it would be useful to think about what happens after Hu leaves the stage.
    Who takes the mantle of leadership and what are his views?

    earlier this month has given important clues about the “crown prince’s” political
    orientations and his relations with key Chinese Communist Party (CCP) factions.
    ***After his induction into the Central Military Commission (CMC) last October,
    there is little doubt that the 57-year-old Politburo Standing Committee (PBSC)
    member will succeed Hu Jintao as Party General Secretary at the 18th Party Congress
    slated for late 2012***.

    ideology and aspirations. Equally significantly, Xi’s bonding with Politburo member
    and Chongqing Party Secretary Bo Xilai shows that the vice-president may be putting
    together his own team in the run-up to taking over the helm in less than two years’
    time. Seeds of conflict between Hu and Xi, respectively the “core” of the CCP’s
    Fourth- and Fifth-Generation leadership, might also have been sown.

    flamboyant former minister of commerce has made headlines with his no-holds-barred
    advocacy of Maoist norms. In his speeches, the charismatic Bo has profusely cited
    Mao-era slogans such as “plain living and hard struggle” and “human beings need
    to have [a revolutionary] spirit” (People’s Daily, June 7; Chongqing Evening News,
    June 28). He has resuscitated Cultural Revolution-vintage revolutionary operas.
    Bo, who is the 61-year-old son of conservative party elder Bo Yibo, even asks
    his secretaries to regularly text-message Mao quotations to the city’s students
    (See “The CCP's Disturbing Revival of Maoism,” China Brief, November 19, 2009).
    On the economic front, the high-profile “princeling” has made waves with his attempts
    to go after “red GDP,” a reference to economic construction that exemplifies Maoist
    egalitarianism. Chongqing has emerged as a national pacesetter in social-welfare
    policies such as providing subsidized public housing to the city’s masses (Chongqing
    Evening News, May 1; China News Service, April 20).

    who leans Maoist. If Xi Jinping does embrace some form of Maoism, what happens
    to China then? Will Deng Xiaopeng's comment about "glorious to be rich" be no
    longer applicable?
