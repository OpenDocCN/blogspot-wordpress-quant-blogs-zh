    in the fixed income space. My strategies focus on intra-day trading primarily,
    but have found the start of a number of very attractive longer term (low frequency)
    strategies.

    for Canadian bonds. Alternatively, we are also looking at cointegration models
    that would be implemented as long/short baskets of securities.

    momentum over a period as a predictor of return over the following period. Did
    not expect to have such strong results. Here is the average return predicted by
    momentums at various standard deviations from parity:'

    (much like the [Aruoba-Diebold-Scotto Business Conditions Index](http://www.philadelphiafed.org/research-and-data/real-time-center/business-conditions-index/)).
    This provides a continuous forecast of economic variables based on a stochastic
    state space model. Will discuss further in the next post.
