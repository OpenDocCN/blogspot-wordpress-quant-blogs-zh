> 来源：[https://hpcquantlib.wordpress.com/2016/09/11/building-r-packages-with-rcpp-and-quantlib-on-windows/#0001-01-01](https://hpcquantlib.wordpress.com/2016/09/11/building-r-packages-with-rcpp-and-quantlib-on-windows/#0001-01-01)

Using Rcpp and QuantLib to build new R packages is straight forward on Unix/Linux. More steps are needed to achieve the same on Windows. Please find [here](https://github.com/klausspanderen/RHestonSLV/blob/master/readme.win) a short manual taking the [RHestonSLV](https://hpcquantlib.wordpress.com/2016/05/26/rfinance-2016/) packages as an example.
