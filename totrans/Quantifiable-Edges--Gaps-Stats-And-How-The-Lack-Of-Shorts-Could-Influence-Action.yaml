    in the SPY peaked at just over 2%. As of Tuesday’s close the reading was down
    to 1.82%. Tonight as I type the futures are up over 1%, so expect another gap
    on Wednesday. The 2.01% average is a record. The only other time SPY cam close
    was after 9/11, when the 10-day absolute average gap hit 1.99%. It actually peaked
    on 9/24 when the SPY gapped up 2.5% after gapping down 4.74% the previous day
    (and over 8% down on 9/17 when the market re-opened).

    gaps in either direction had a tendency to lead to gains from open to close.

- en: The upside edge for large gaps down was likely due to the fact that the move
    was an overreaction and the retail traders got fleeced. The sharp morning drop
    may have allowed a temporary panic bottom to form and the market to move higher
    as the day wore on.

- en: The upside edge for large gaps higher often comes from the fact that the shorts
    just got trapped. They need to cover their positions and are forced to chase as
    the market moves against them. These bear traps have often come following a Fed
    or other government announcement. The massive gap up on Friday was engineered
    with perfect timing for a short squeeze since it was expiration Friday.

    and weeks. With their new rule prohibiting short sales in a large number of stocks,
    it would seem the government has taken away some potential explosiveness. If no
    one is chasing the gaps and bounces higher, the rally loses a good number of potential
    buyers.

    support as the shorts that didn’t chase start covering when then market begins
    to pull back. With reduced explosiveness and less support, the elimination of
    shorts could actually make the bottoming process more difficult. At the very least
    it may change the shape of the bottom. It will certainly be interesting to watch
    and trade.
