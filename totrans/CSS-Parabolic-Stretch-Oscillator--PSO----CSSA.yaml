- en: The last article introduced the PTO (Parabolic Time Oscillator) which  is in
    my opinion a very unique approach that capitalizes on the appealing qualities
    of the PSAR. Following this logic, I thought I would raise the subject of another
    complementary idea– the Parabolic Stretch Oscillator. Both indicators will give
    you information about a market that the RSI14 or stochastic cannot give you since
    they are rolling momentum oscillators that have little or no memory. True bull
    euphoria or bear panics occur in a parabolic fashion (or inverse parabola), and
    thus what better to measure than a parabolic stretch.

    this for fast, medium and slow settings), measure the absolute value of the  ATR

- en: The PSO is also valuable as a guide to overbought/oversold since only very strongly
    trending markets can make significant gains versus the aggressive PSAR stop. The
    oscillator may be used in conjunction with the PTO to give an excellent composite
    view of how much a market has moved without a retracement. Furthermore, for trend-followers
    this can be used to guide in de-leveraging positions–a critical matter with leveraged
    futures trading– versus looking for an arbitrary floating profit target. The PSO
    is likely to be far more accurate at predicting a retracement at extremes, thus
    the saavy trader will seek to de-leverage a long position as the PSO hits very
    high levels and look to re-enter on the first pullback.
