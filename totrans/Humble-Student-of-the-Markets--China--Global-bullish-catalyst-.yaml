    a story of differing relative strength. The Euro STOXX 50 has been flat since
    early February the best relative performer. MSCI China has been correcting, but
    turned up last week when Hong Kong announced that it was eliminating its COVID
    mask mandate. In addition, China's PMI data came in better than expected, indicating
    expansion. The S&P 500 topped out mid-February and its bottom lagged both Europe
    and China.
