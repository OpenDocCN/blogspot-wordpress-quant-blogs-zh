- en: Sometimes a big move in the VIX is significant and sometimes it is a lot harder
    to interpret. On the surface, yesterday’s 24.7% drop in the VIX – the second largest
    one day move down in percentage terms – appears to fall in the latter category.

    and once again in [1994](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/1994) (see
    green arrows in top graphic). Each instance signaled a bottom and about a three
    week bounce. The markets then moved up sharply in 1995, but it is a large stretch
    to say that the VIX offered any signal about a move that was at least nine months
    away.'

    into vogue](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/10/yesterdays-vix-drop-is-fifth-largest.html)
    in the middle of 2006 and including yesterday, there are now six such instances
    in the past two years and four months. The bottom chart also marks these 20% drops
    with green arrows, which once again tend to signal bounces of no more than about
    three weeks.

- en: In general, I do not consider a 20% one day drop in the VIX to be particularly
    significant. In most cases this is merely a statistical quirk which results from
    the typical mean reversion process that appears while volatility retraces the
    path of a previous upward [VIX spike](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20spikes).
    In such instances, the initial VIX spike is the more noteworthy event.

- en: In all fairness, I can make a slightly different case for the current environment
    in that the eight week VIX spike that topped out at 81.17 was so severe and persistent
    that it is not so much the extreme [fear](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/fear)
    that is important from a trading perspective, but an indication that a diminution
    of that fear is taking place. In many places in this country, people have not
    been this fearful in 75 years, so any indication that fear may be starting to
    reverse direction is indeed significant.
