    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    buy signals have been followed by multi-month bull phases.

    a bull trend after a monthly MACD buy signal. The last sell signal occurred in
    August 2018, and the market topped out two months later (see
