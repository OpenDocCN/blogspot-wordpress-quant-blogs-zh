    and [UVXY](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/UVXY) have become overnight
    sensations during the last few weeks, one group of [VIX exchange-traded products](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20ETN)
    (ETPs) that continues to toil in relative obscurity is the dozen ETRACS VIX ETN
    that [UBS](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/UBS) launched in September
    2011.

    futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures) and include
    both long and inverse products with target weighted average maturities of 1 month,
    2 months, 3 months, 4 months, 5 months and 6 months. The tickers are straightforward
    as well: [VXAA](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXAA) for the 1month
    long product, with [AAVX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/AAVX) for
    the 1 month inverse product; [VXBB](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXBB)
    for the 2 month long product, with [BBVX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/BBVX)
    for the 2 month inverse product; etc.'

    in a standard brokerage account the ability to be long or short almost any portion
    of the VIX futures curve without having to trade in a futures account and deal
    with the additional regulatory, margin and other complexities of maintaining a
    futures account.

    across all twelve produces was less than 10,000 shares today and unfortunately
    that is a typical trading day for the ETRACS suite.

- en: Even if you elect not to trade any of the ETRACS volatility ETPs, studying their
    price movements can yield a fair amount of insight. All were first traded on September
    8, when the VIX was trading at about 34\. In the intervening period, all the long
    VIX products have lost ground (from -8% to -38%, depending upon target maturity),
    while all the inverse products have made money (from +5.9% to +15.8%, depending
    upon target maturity), as shown in the graphic below. Due largely to the ravages
    of [term structure](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/term%20structure)
    and negative [roll yield](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/roll%20yield),
    the losses have been larger than the gains and the mean performance across all
    twelve ETPs (solid bright red line) has been a loss of 5.6% during the five months
    and twenty days since these products were launched.

    need a lot more fans if this is going to be the case), then they will paint a
    fascinating picture of the evolving VIX term structure and the consequences of
    negative and positive roll yield. As it is now, even the short-lived mirror image
    lines tell a story that is worth paying attention to.
