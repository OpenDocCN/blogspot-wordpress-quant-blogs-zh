    is significant macro risk in the financial system. The Federal Reserve has undertanken
    to blow serial asset bubbles, the latest being QE2, which will lead to rolling
    boom-bust cycles. The Fed balance sheet is already precarious in the wake of QE2\.
    While they may be able to rescue the situation right now, at some point it will
    all come down like a house of cards. When that happens, the fallout is going to
    be really, really ugly.

    trading partners and risking currency wars. Its effects are showing up, not so
    much in the FX markets, but in commodity prices.

    party that the Fed was throwing. Grantham reluctantly allowed that the stock market
    could rise even further from current levels.

    bullishness stems from his belief that the supply-demand equation has shifted

    lot faster and their rising resource intensity is putting upward pressure on demand. **Where
    I differ:** I am a little bit more [skeptical about the commodity bullish supply-demand
    story](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2010/11/china-and-oil-usage.html).
    I am a long-term commodity bull because I believe that the pressures from overly
    accommodative global fiscal and monetary policy are likely to manifest themselves
    in higher commodity prices.'

    which would have similar effects as the Smoot-Hawley tariffs had during the Great
    Depression. **Where I differ:** I just worry about tail risk, which can be either
    inflationary or deflationary. In no particular order, here are some of the events
    that may set off another crisis: China slows into a hard landing, more deflationary
    pressures in Europe, e.g. Spanish real estate falls another 30%, or the Germans
    balk at supporting their EU brethrens, the fragile US economy slips into a double-dip
