- en: Over the weekend I decided to upgrade to Microsoft [Silverlight 5 RC](http://www.silverlight.net/learn/overview/what's-new-in-silverlight-5).
    I‚Äôm currently working on two Proof Of Concept (POC) applications that use different
    web streaming products ‚Äì one likes to remain neutral in the streaming space üôÇ
    Unfortunately I appear to be getting mixed results from running my two applications.
