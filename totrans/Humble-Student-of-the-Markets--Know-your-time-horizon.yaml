    stocks melted up 200% or plunged 67%?" For investors with 30 year time horizons,
    the counter-intuitive answer is the 66% plunge in stock prices.

    investors are keenly aware, there are two other sources of returns for investors.
    The first source is capital gains, the second is income (interest for bonds and
    dividends for stocks) and, lastly, re-investment return, or interest on interest.

    horizons, periodic corrections and bear markets are helpful to terminal wealth
    value as that dividend income can be re-invested at lower prices.

    client was formed as a trust and most of the positions acquired decades ago, e.g.
    GE with a cost base in pennies. The low cost base of the positions made selling
    nearly impossible because of the capital gains liability, so the client adopted
    an investment policy of focusing on companies with a history of good dividend
    growth. That way, the current beneficiaries could enjoy a steady and predictable
    rising income stream. Bear markets were especially welcome, as we could "harvest"
    capital losses to offset the capital gains from the sale of positions with low
    costs.

    when I called to report our quarterly results when stock prices were rising. I
    almost felt like I had to apologize, "Sorry, we made you money this quarter. Your
    portfolio went up by X%." Nevertheless, the strategy of focusing on dividend growth
    made sense as it should provide better overall returns in the long run for investors
    with sufficiently long time horizons.

    what you really want. Know your time horizon.
