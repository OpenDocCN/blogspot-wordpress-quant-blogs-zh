    I now watch the financial sector SPDR ([XLF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLF))
    and the KBW Bank Index ([BKX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/BKX))
    tick by tick, in addition to a handful of financial stocks that seem to be in
    the most peril on a particular day.

    on in the financial sector, from banks and brokerage houses to insurers and consumer
    finance companies, XLF pretty much covers the waterfront.

    the problem facing XLF and the broader markets at the moment. Stocks are overbought
    in the short-term and oversold in the long-term.

- en: Rather than use oscillators to show how overbought and oversold stocks are,
    I generally prefer to rely on a combination of moving averages and trend strength
    indicators, with volatility as an important secondary indicator. Looking at the
    moving averages, XLF is now well above the 10 day MA and running up against resistance
    in the form of the 50 day MA. In terms of trend, utilizing the [Aroon](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Aroon)
    indicator to measure trend and breakout strength, XLF is bullish in the 10 day
    calculations, but bearish from a 30 day perspective. In this chart there is not
    much to see in terms of volatility, but by tracking in the upper half of the [Bollinger
    Bands](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Bollinger%20bands), XLF generally
    has positive short-term momentum, while proximity to the upper band suggests a
    reversal is likely soon.

    trend following crowd, while overbought indicators have the swing trading crowd
    ready to get short. Such is the current state of the market. The direction in
    which you lean is more likely to be a function of the [time horizon](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/time%20horizon)
    of your analysis than any other technical factor.'
