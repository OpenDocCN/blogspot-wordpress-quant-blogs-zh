    is clearly wrong the vision is wrong.  Marxists and their ilk thought the rate
    of profit would continually fall, until the proletariate took over and the state
    withered away.  In the 1940's economists thought that while capitalism offered
    greater liberty, the higher productivity of socialism would overtake capitalism.

    habits bred into us by capitalism have left us incapable of enjoying it properly.
    The Devil, it seems, has claimed his reward... The point to keep in mind is that
    we know, prior to anything scientists or statisticians can tell us, that the unending
    pursuit of wealth is madness. The first defect is moral. The banking crisis has
    shown yet again that the present system relies on motives of greed and acquisitiveness,
    which are morally repugnant.
