- en: O’Reilly Radar has an interesting article on event-driven [architecture](http://radar.oreilly.com/2015/02/variations-in-event-driven-architecture.html),
    “Variations in event-driven architecture”.  Mark Richard’s eBook is available
    [here](https://mdavey.wordpress.com/2015/02/19/user-story-map/ "User Story Map")
    if you want the full read.

    about the number of event queues when using the Mediator topology – a strange
    thought process in my view unless the architect is proposing to use a single queue
    for all event types 😦

    in an event-driven architecture

    integration hubs, and instead just straight into coding their own variant – lack
    of ROI

- en: The simplest and most common implementation of the event mediator is through
    open source integration hubs such as Spring Integration, Apache Camel, or Mule
    ESB.

    surprising how many people look at me blankly when I mention Space-Based architectures
    😦
