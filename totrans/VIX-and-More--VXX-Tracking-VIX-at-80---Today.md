# VIX and More: VXX Tracking VIX at 80+% Today

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/02/vxx-tracking-vix-at-80-today.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/02/vxx-tracking-vix-at-80-today.html#0001-01-01)

As I write this, the VIX is at 51.30, up 9% and [VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX) is at 116.40, up 7.5%.

I continue to get quite a few questions about VXX, the [VIX ETN](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20ETN). The biggest issues, by far, seem to be around how well VXX tracks the VIX and how much juice to expect from VXX relative to the VIX.

As best I can determine, when there are small day to day changes in the SPX, VXX should reflect, on average, approximately 35-40% of the daily change in the VIX. In more volatile markets, such as SPX daily changes of 3% or more, VXX should move, *on average*, about 55-60% as much as the VIX does. (Of course, on average, if you walk down the middle of a two way street you won’t get hit by oncoming traffic, but deviate to one side or the other even briefly…)
