    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to

    contraction (bearish)?"

    a convincing upside breakout. Not only have the major global averages broken out

    In the past, such buy signals have indicated significant price gains, with only
    minor downside risk.
