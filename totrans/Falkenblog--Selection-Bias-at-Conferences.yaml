    Merril CEO), Richard Fuld (Lehman ex-CEO), Martin Sullivan (ex AIG CEO), Marcel
    Ospel (ex UBS Chairman), Lloyd Blankfein (Goldman CEO). Now, these people used
    to go, and used to be listened to. I would think their stock of knowledge is now
    much greater after adversity than prior, and they have a much more interesting
    tale to tell. But many think these people have merely been exposed as having been
    lucky fools who seemed like geniuses because of the bull markets they presided
    over.'

    get a job with him or his successful acolytes, or learn about how to be successful
    like them. But a successful person is probably not going to be totally forthright
    about their edge, even if they know it (after Bob Rubin stated that their subprime
    exposure was a detail outside his scope, clearly many titular leaders are merely
    figureheads). Failure, in contrast, leads to more particularized soul searching.

    to admit mistakes that are supposedly right in their wheelhouse, right in their
    area of expertise. But in fact these are the errors that are most instructive,
    because the errors of a dilletante are not very generalizable, but when John Merriweather
    screwed up Long Term Capital Management in 1998, and now

    wrong, in his opinion? He is not stupid (hate the sin, love the sinner). Errors
    by experts in their own domain are very, very interesting, much more so than listening
    to someone who didn't fail last year. After all, they could merely have been timid,
    or clueless. Putting all your money in cash, or having a monkey randomly going
    long or short the S&P every day would have outperformed the S&P last year. Noise
    would have beat most investments last year, so although it is clearly better to
    have made 0% last year, I'm not impressed. There's a hedge fund that was down
    only a couple of percent last year, and thinks people will flock to them for their

    good faith, that their errors were reasonable, and so to that end, listening to
    their explanation about what they did, and why it didn't work, is truly enlightening.
    Much more so than Maria Bartiromo talking to George Soros about his silly reflexivity
    theory.

    open one to damages for negligence, and that is unfortunate.
