    but no right is.

- en: The liberal ideas that gave rise to the Enlightenment are generally thought
    (eg, Steven Pinker) to be a break from a religious thinking. Yet the key liberal
    idea, individual rights, especially property rights, are an axiom with little
    justification outside Christian theology. As Feynman noted with regards to scientific
    laws, the process of finding new ones is not deriving them via logic, but rather,
    guessing, and then looking at the consequences. History has shown that individual
    property rights are good. Friedrich Hayek noted that a universal morality is beyond
    human knowledge, in that prior to markets actually existing--say, while we were
    hunter-gatherers--one would never have predicted free markets are better than
    socialism. Individual property rights are one of those moral principles that were
    discovered outside of pure reason.

    is what his people need. It's the original conflation of the state and society.
    The idea that a regular individual can seek his own self-interest and simultaneously
    be optimally working for society seems absurd, in that clearly there are many
    evil people who have no interest in bettering society. The idea that the state
    should ultimately own everything is an ancient idea, and private property highly
    non-intuitive idea, why it took so long to develop.

    caveat. For example, Cicero (106-43 BCE) wrote that "I do not mean to find fault
    with the accumulation of property, provided it hurts nobody, but unjust acquisition
    of it is always to be avoided." With this little exception many rulers could capriciously
    expropriate, in the same way there is a right to free speech in Cuba as long as
    it is "in keeping with the objectives of socialist society." Roman emperors viewed
    private associations like guilds as having the right to property, but these had
    to be founded with state authority and were closely regulated.

- en: St. Augustine (354-430 CE) noted that reason is insufficient to motivate a truly
    Good Will. The will has reasons outside of reason, and is essential for being
    'good,' so the individual is primary, his relation to anyone else secondary. 
    In 1140 Gratian wrote the Decretum, a collection of Canon law as a legal textbook.
    It argued that natural law of men created in the image of God is the Golden Rule.
    "Natural law is what is contained in the law and the Gospel. By it, each person
    is commanded to do to others what he wants done to himself and is prohibited from
    inflicting on others what he does not want done to himself." Gratian's identification
    of natural law with the Golden Rule (Matthew 7:12) departs from the definition
    in Justinian's civil code (529 CE), which defines that natural law is what “nature
    teaches all animals.”

- en: Franciscan friar Duns Scotus (1266-1308) argued that morality needs freedom
    because without freedom, a person cannot do anything praiseworthy; without freedom
    actions do not represent the will, so are morally neutral. Fellow friar William
    of Ockham’s (1285-1347) writings on natural law are significant for the ideas
    of both individual rights and consent to government. Defending his Franciscan
    order against papal criticisms of their teachings on spiritual poverty, he distinguished
    among the various meanings of the Latin word jus (law, right) and dominium (rule,
    property) to defend an individual right to property. Ockham's emphasis on faith
    and freedom countered Thomas Aquinas's rationalist account of natural law. Rights,
    liberty, were paramount, and these put limits on the power of rulers.

    rights, freedom, equality, limited government, popular sovereignty, consent to
    law and government, and the right of the people to resist tyrannical rulers. Hugo
    Grotius (1583-1645) was a Dutch jurist and argued that nature was not an entity
    in itself, but God''s creation. Samuel Pufendorf (1632-1694) relied on Grotius
    to argue that the state is nothing more than the sum of the individual wills that
    are associated within it, and hence the state needs to submit to a discipline
    essential for human safety. In this view, the state is a subordinate claimant
    on the individual, behind the individual''s prerogative, who then has the free
    will to sin or not.'

- en: Finally, John Locke (1632-1704) also thought natural law was the same as biblical
    revelation, both originated from God. Thus, the Euthyphro dilemma "is what is
    morally good commanded by God because it is morally good, or is it morally good
    because it is commanded by God?" is no dilemma because God wrote his moral code
    on our heart, and his commands are natural law as well if we care to discover
    them via trial and error. The preeminence of property for Locke is clear when
    he writes the 'great and chief end of a commonwealth, and putting themselves under
    government, is the preservation of their property.'

- en: 'When the US Framers of the Constitution refer to individual property rights
    they almost always spoke in overtly religious terms. For example, John Adams wrote
    "If  ''Thou shalt not covet,'' and ''Thou shalt not steal,'' were not commandments
    of heaven, they must be made inviolable precepts in every society before it can
    be civilized or made free." This makes sense because at some level a right like
    cannot be proven, and so like religion takes a bit of faith.  Rights are like
    duties, in that they constrain other objectives irrespective of their utilitarian
    benefits: it is presumed they serve some transcendent or long-term benefit, one
    that cannot be proven but is rather inferred based on an ideology about the way
    the universe works.'

    Convention placed their protection above freedom of religion, press, and speech

    we now most commonly associated with 'rights.' Traditional property is a social
    institution, and society maintains the institution only so long as people think
    private property rights serve the social interest better than alternatives.

    justification. Time and again people have argued that certain property should
    be seized from individuals because it can more effectively be used elsewhere,
    and for specific cases, this will be true (eg, see Posner and Weyl's

    the power to make this assessment is liable to expand its powers, and the result
    will be a crypto-plutocracy portraying itself as representatives of the people
    (see Venezuela), or crony capitalism as in highly regulated states like Italy
    and India.

    empirically over the past couple hundred years. As Feynman noted, good laws start
    with a guess, and then we see if it works by experiment or experience.
