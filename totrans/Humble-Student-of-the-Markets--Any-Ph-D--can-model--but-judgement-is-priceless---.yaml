    this blog. To illustrate my point, I compare and contrast the work of two prominent
    economists, Ed Yardeni and Janet Yellen. Both are at the top of their respective
    professions. Yardeni has been a Wall Street forecaster for as long as I can remember.
    He is the epitome of the practical market savvy modeler. Yellen has a sharp mind
    and she is about to become the Fed Chair, though her thinking appears to be more
    academic in orientation.

    The optimal policy to implement this "balanced approach" to minimizing deviations
    from the inflation and unemployment goals involves keeping the federal funds rate
    close to zero until early 2016, about two quarters longer than in the illustrative
    baseline, and keeping the federal funds rate below the baseline path through 2018\.
    This highly accommodative policy path generates a faster reduction in unemployment

    hike when the 6.5% mark is crossed. A threshold of 5.5% is largely just a recognition
