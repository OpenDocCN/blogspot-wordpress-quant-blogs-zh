- en: I have long been a proponent of the intelligent use of quantitative models on
    this blog. To illustrate my point, I compare and contrast the work of two prominent
    economists, Ed Yardeni and Janet Yellen. Both are at the top of their respective
    professions. Yardeni has been a Wall Street forecaster for as long as I can remember.
    He is the epitome of the practical market savvy modeler. Yellen has a sharp mind
    and she is about to become the Fed Chair, though her thinking appears to be more
    academic in orientation.

    during 2009 through mid-2011\. However, it stalled since then and continues to
    flat-line. As I’ve noted before, the forward earnings of EM MSCI has been highly
    correlated with the CRB raw industrials spot price index since the mid-1990s.

    by implication, this development should provide some positive fundamental backdrop

    enunciated longer-run goals and balanced approach, I assume that monetary policy
    aims to minimize the deviations of inflation from 2 percent and the deviations
    of the unemployment rate from 6 percent, with equal weight on both objectives.
    In computing the best, or "optimal policy," path for the federal funds rate to
    achieve these objectives, I will assume that the public fully anticipates that
    the FOMC will follow this optimal plan and is able to assess its effect on the
    economy.

    The optimal policy to implement this "balanced approach" to minimizing deviations
    from the inflation and unemployment goals involves keeping the federal funds rate
    close to zero until early 2016, about two quarters longer than in the illustrative
    baseline, and keeping the federal funds rate below the baseline path through 2018\.
    This highly accommodative policy path generates a faster reduction in unemployment
    than in the baseline, while inflation slightly overshoots the Committee's 2 percent
    objective for several years.

    models can be highly sensitive to the economic forecasts and the controls can
    be touchy. A small change in the dial can result in huge changes in market expectations.
    In quant-speak, it means that outputs can be non-linear to changes in inputs.
    I believe that Yellen understands that and therefore cautioned against the blind
    adherence to this model.

    a different policy than the threshold based guidance currently in play. And I
    would say that persistent concerns about financial stability make it difficult
    for the Fed to credibly commit to such a period of low rates, even if policymakers
    wanted to make such a commitment. ***Hence the exercise with threshold-based guidance
    to begin with - it is intended to capture as many of the gains of the optimal
