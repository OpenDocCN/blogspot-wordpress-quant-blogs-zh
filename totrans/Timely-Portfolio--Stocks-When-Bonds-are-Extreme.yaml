- en: In [Extreme Bond Returns](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2012/01/extreme-bond-returns.html),
    I did not consider the context of extreme bond returns, so let’s examine annual
    returns for the Dow Jones Industrial Average when bonds experience extreme annual
    returns.  I was very surprised that stocks performed extremely well when bonds
    also did extremely well.  Unfortunately, 6 of the 8 periods all occurred during
    the incredible 30 year bond bull 1980-2011, so it is difficult to come to any
    universal conclusions.
