    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    insisting that his critics are trying to take away what he sees as his calling
    card for re-election. Mr. Trump has been agitated in discussions of the economy,
    and by the news media’s reporting of warnings of a possible recession. He has
    said forces that do not want him to win have been overstating the damage his trade
    war has caused, according to people who have spoken with him. And several aides
    agree with him that the news media is overplaying the economic fears, adding to
    his feeling of being justified, people close to the president said.
