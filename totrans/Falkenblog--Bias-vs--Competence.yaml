- en: I put no special value in peer review. You can have a peer who discards a paper
    for purely idiosyncratic reasons, or because he just does not understand key aspects
    of the paper. More often, you have a peer who approves a paper because it cites
    his own work favorably, which makes it immune to criticism in the eyes of the
    reviewer.

  zh: 我对同行评审并不特别重视。你可能会遇到一个同行，出于纯粹的个人偏见或者仅仅因为他根本不理解论文的关键方面而将一篇论文抛弃。更常见的情况是，你会遇到一个同行，他会批准一篇论文，因为它对他自己的工作进行了有利的引用，这使得论文在审阅者眼中免受批评。
- en: He is describing the his frustration with the popularity of certain strains
    of economic thought that are dictating current research, but to him seem a dead
    end. Such things often happen because as a field gets more advanced it takes considerable
    investment just to participate in the debates, but then, after investing a couple
    years in such learning, one is in somewhat of a dilemma, because noting 'this
    is all hairsplitting nonsense' both alienates you from your colleagues (presumably,
    many of whom are friends), and also trashes a lot of your human capital. Thus,
    many in a position to make strong criticisms tend to merely make inside the paradigm
    criticisms.

  zh: 他描述了自己对某些主导当前研究方向的经济思想流派的流行感到沮丧，因为在他看来，这些思想流派是一条死路。这种情况经常发生，因为随着一个领域的进步，要参与到辩论中就需要付出相当大的投资，但是，在学习了几年后，一个人会陷入一种困境，因为指出“这一切都是琐碎的废话”既会使你疏远你的同事（很可能，其中许多人是朋友），也会破坏你的大量人力资本。因此，许多有能力提出强烈批评的人往往只是对范式内部提出批评。
- en: Obviously this is bad, but the problem is current paradigms don't have neat
    labels that allow us to objectively distinguish between fads and facts. It is
    the trade-off between the incompetent many versus the corrupt few, the fact that
    experts are biased, but the masses are ignorant. I think moderation is the key
    to this debate as any other, and so there will be an optimum in the messy middle.
    That is, I'm glad we don't have referendums from the general populace, university
    students, or even the American Economic Association (AEA) on basic arguments.
    Yet I'm also troubled by the way certain threads within economics become citation
    circles that waste resources and hurt the economics brand.

  zh: 显然，这是不好的，但问题是当前的范式并没有简单的标签，使我们能够客观地区分潮流和事实。这是无能的多数与腐败的少数之间的权衡，专家有偏见，但群众无知。我认为中庸是这场辩论的关键，就像其他任何辩论一样，因此，在混乱的中间地带会有一个最佳点。也就是说，我很高兴我们没有来自普通民众、大学生，甚至美国经济学会（AEA）的关于基本论点的全民公投。但我也对经济学内部某些思路成为浪费资源和损害经济学品牌的引用圈子感到担忧。

    meaning this immensely popular author did not have to mind the academic peer review
    process. In contrast, I remember TA-ing for the then President of the AEA Robert
    Eisner and his submission to the main AEA journal (the AER) was rejected while
    he was President--kudos to Economics integrity! As popular as Galbraith was in
    his life through his writings and omnipresence as a public intellectual, I don''t
    think Galbraith''s ideas have held up very well: check out Industrial Organization
    journals or graduate textbooks, and you won''t find his name very often if at
    all. For example, Galbraith argued a lot that large firms have a lot of market
    power over competitors and consumers, but the small size effect suggests being
    large is not a net advantage, but rather a disadvantage (eg, why couldn''t GM
    crush Toyota in the crib?).'
