    Swan of Cairo: How Suppressing Volatility Makes the World Less Predictable and
    More Dangerous](http://fooledbyrandomness.com/ForeignAffairs.pdf) is a thought-provoking
    effort by co-authors [Nassim Nicholas Taleb](http://www.foreignaffairs.com/author/nassim-nicholas-taleb)
    and [Mark Blyth](http://www.foreignaffairs.com/author/mark-blyth) to advance the
    idea the efforts of policy-makers to smooth out the peaks and troughs of volatility
    actually has the unintended consequence of making the world a more volatile place.'

    Volatility Makes the World More Dangerous](http://resourceinsights.blogspot.com/2012/01/suppressing-volatility-makes-world-more.html),
    by Kurt Cobb of [Resource Insights](http://resourceinsights.blogspot.com/). Here
    Cobb extends the thinking of Taleb and Blyth and argues that not only do efforts
    to suppress volatility backfire in the economic and political realms, but also
    in areas such as agriculture and public health.

    of complex systems in Jurassic Park some two decades ago outflanked Taleb, Blyth
    and Cobb, but on a week when a low VIX seems to have many vexed, ruminating on
    the ideas of Taleb, Blyth and Cobb may help readers flesh out some insights into
    what may lie ahead. Along the same lines, I believe the links below might also
    contain some provocative and related thought starters.
