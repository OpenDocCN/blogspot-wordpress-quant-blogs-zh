    on commodities. This means that not only consumer non-durables (e.g. soap) will
    be areas of growth, but non-durables (furniture, cars) as well as services (telecom)
    in the emerging market countries. Jeremy Grantham of GMO also comments on this
    in his essay

    from China as everything he brings is stamped with “Made in China”. Look at your
    shirts, your toys and your electronics. If they continue to be made in China,
    India, Turkey, Vietnam, Guatemala, etc. then the emerging markets should continue
    their long-term growth, which will also be bullish for commodities.
