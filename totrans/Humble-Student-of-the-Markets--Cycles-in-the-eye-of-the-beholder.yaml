- en: Walter is a highly experienced technical analyst and his tenure at Mother Merrill
    dates back to the days of Bob Farrell. His specialty is cycle analysis and Elliott
    Wave Theory, which is a topic that I never understood well because the sensitivity
    of EW analysis to initial conditions.

- en: With the caveat that the market is affected by many cycles and the effects of
     a cycle low or high may be overwhelmed by the effects of other cycles, I present
    below a five year chart of the SPX with a 21 week cycle (as per Walter's observation
    that the 20 week cycle lasts 21-22 weeks). The vertical lines are the 21-week
    "cycle lows"; the blue arrows represent "good" buying signals at each of those
    lows where there was little or no downside for the next 4-6 weeks; and the red
    arrows represent "bad" buying signals where the market went on to see significant
    downside for the next 4-6 weeks. As the chart shows, there are significantly more
    blue arrows representing "good" buying signals than red arrows indicating "bad"
    signals.

    stock prices can move higher. Walter's cycle analysis and Mistal's seasonal patterns
    are another pieces of the mosaic that confirm that bullish view.
