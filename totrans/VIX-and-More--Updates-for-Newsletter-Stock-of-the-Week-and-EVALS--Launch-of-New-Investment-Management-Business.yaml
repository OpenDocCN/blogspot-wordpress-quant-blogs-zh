    data for EVALS or for the [Stock of the Week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/stock%20of%20the%20week)
    due to a variety of factors related to the launch of my new investment management
    business. I will continue to offer the newsletter, which will still include the
    Stock of the Week selection; I will also continue to offer the EVALS model portfolio
    service and will be pleased to discuss current performance data privately. As
    soon as the launch of my new investment management business is finalized, I will
    highlight some of the particulars in this space.
