    history is any guide, the rally is just starting and should continue until the
    first week of 2014\. In the past, the Dow has advanced roughly 2% from now until
    the first week of January.

    below of the SPX shows upside potential of roughly 1850, based on the convergence
    of the 2 standard deviation upper bound of the weekly Bollinger Band depicted
    trend line. An advance to the 1850 level represents a gain of approximately 2%
    gain.

- en: If equity prices were to rally that much that quickly, short-term oscillators
    would move into overbought readings and stock prices would likely pause or correct
    from those levels. Breadth indicators have been showing negative divergences for
    the last few months and they paint a picture of a rally that is running out of
    steam. One likely scenario is equity prices pause after the seasonally positive
    Santa Clause rally.

    Net New High/New Low NYSE indicator (top panel) is showing a pattern of lower
    highs and lower lows while the SPX (bottom panel) continues to advance to new
    all-time highs. For the bullish case to hold, I would be more comfortable with
    this rally if the Net New High/New Low indicator were to rise above the resistance
    zone shown in yellow:'

    50 day moving average. This is a sign of deteriorating breadth and fewer and fewer
    stocks are driving this rally. The resistance band, shown in yellow, will be more
    challenging for this breadth indicator to overcome as this market advances.

    above their 200 day moving averages. The message from these different breadth
    indicators using different methodologies and look-back windows tell the same story
    of declining breadth.

- en: Equally disturbing for the bulls who hope that a Santa Claus rally can carry
    on until well into 2014 is the relative performance of the small cap stocks. As
    the chart below of the small cap RUT compared to the large cap SPX shows, small
    caps have been underperforming even as the market rallied. The failure of a high
    beta sector like small cap stocks to assume market leadership is a knock against
    the longevity of this bull move.

    of small caps. Shouldn't higher beta stocks like mid and small cap stocks be leading
    the market upwards if this bull phase is to be sustainable?
