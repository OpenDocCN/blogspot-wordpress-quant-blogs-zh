    to the democratic demands of their citizens. Trade agreements’ new boosters euphemistically
    claim that they are simply after regulatory harmonization, a clean-sounding phrase
    that implies an innocent plan to promote efficiency. One could, of course, get
    regulatory harmonization by strengthening regulations to the highest standards
    everywhere. But when corporations call for harmonization, what they really mean
    is a race to the bottom.

    has agreed to similarly minimal regulations — multinational corporations can return
    to the practices that were common before the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts became
    law (in 1970 and 1972, respectively) and before the latest financial crisis hit.
    Corporations everywhere may well agree that getting rid of regulations would be
    good for corporate profits. Trade negotiators might be persuaded that these trade
    agreements would be good for trade and corporate profits. But there would be some
    big losers — namely, the rest of us.

    in secret. All over the world, trade ministries are captured by corporate and
    financial interests. And when negotiations are secret, there is no way that the
    democratic process can exert the checks and balances required to put limits on
    the negative effects of these agreements.

    we know of its particulars only makes it more unpalatable. One of the worst is
    that it allows corporations to seek restitution in an international tribunal,
    not only for unjust expropriation, but also for alleged diminution of their potential
    profits as a result of regulation. This is not a theoretical problem. Philip Morris
    has already tried this tactic against Uruguay, claiming that its antismoking regulations,
    which have won accolades from the World Health Organization, unfairly hurt profits,
    violating a bilateral trade treaty between Switzerland and Uruguay. In this sense,
    recent trade agreements are reminiscent of the Opium Wars, in which Western powers
    successfully demanded that China keep itself open to opium because they saw it
    as vital in correcting what otherwise would be a large trade imbalance.

    to undermine environmental and other regulations. Developing countries pay a high
    price for signing on to these provisions, but the evidence that they get more
    investment in return is scant and controversial. And though these countries are
    the most obvious victims, the same issue could become a problem for the United
    States, as well. American corporations could conceivably create a subsidiary in
    some Pacific Rim country, invest in the United States through that subsidiary,
    and then take action against the United States government — getting rights as
    a “foreign” company that they would not have had as an American company. Again,
    this is not just a theoretical possibility: There is already some evidence that
    companies are choosing how to funnel their money into different countries on the
    basis of where their legal position in relation to the government is strongest.'

    Yes, there are winners and losers, the theory went, but the winners can always
    compensate the losers, so that free trade (or even freer trade) is a win-win.
    This conclusion, unfortunately, is based on numerous assumptions, many of which
    are simply wrong.

    could move seamlessly between jobs. It was assumed that the economy was at full
    employment, so that workers displaced by globalization would quickly move from
    low-productivity sectors (which had thrived simply because foreign competition
    was kept at bay through tariffs and other trade restrictions) to high-productivity
    sectors. But when there is a high level of unemployment, and especially when a
    large percentage of the unemployed have been out of work long-term (as is the
    case now), there can’t be such complacency.

    get one. Millions have stopped looking. So there is a real risk that individuals
    moved from low productivity-employment in a protected sector will end up zero-productivity
    members of the vast ranks of the unemployed. This hurts even those who keep their
    jobs, as higher unemployment puts downward pressure on wages.

    — whether it’s because of a lack of aggregate demand, or because our banks, more
    interested in speculation and market manipulation than lending, are not providing
    adequate funds to small and medium-size enterprises. But whatever the reasons,

    the old free trade theory said only that the winners could compensate the losers,
    not that they would. And they haven’t — quite the opposite. Advocates of trade
    agreements often say that for America to be competitive, not only will wages have
    to be cut, but so will taxes and expenditures, especially on programs that are
    of benefit to ordinary citizens. We should accept the short-term pain, they say,
    because in the long run, all will benefit. But as John Maynard Keynes famously
    said in another context, “in the long run we are all dead.” In this case, there
    is little evidence that the trade agreements will lead to faster or more profound
    growth.
