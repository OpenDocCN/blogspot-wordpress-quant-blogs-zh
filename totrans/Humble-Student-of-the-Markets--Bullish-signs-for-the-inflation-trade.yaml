    "We hate you guys," Luo Ping, a director-general at the China Banking Regulatory
    Commission (CBRC), complained last week on a visit to New York. "Once you start
    issuing $1-$2 trillion . . . we know the dollar is going to depreciate, so we
    hate you guys, but there is nothing much we can do."

    level. Interestingly, both gold and the USD have been rising in unison - a highly
    unusual situation as they have historically had an inverse relationship. This
    is explained by the fact that both are regarded as safe havens in times of financial
    stress – and the world is certainly stressed right now.
