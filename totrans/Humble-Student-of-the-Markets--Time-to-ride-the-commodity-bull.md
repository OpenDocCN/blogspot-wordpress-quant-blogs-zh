# Humble Student of the Markets: Time to ride the commodity bull

Long time readers know that I am a long-term commodity bull. Moreover, I have been writing on the theme of

[global healing](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2012/01/global-healing.html)

for a few weeks. Despite last week's disappointing US GDP report, I am seeing signs that it may be time to get on the commodity bull for a ride. Both sentiment and momentum indicators are lining up for another upleg in commodity prices.

First of all, sentiment measures indicate that commodity prices are at levels suggesting accumulation. This chart from Mary Ann Bartels of BoA/Merrill Lynch (Note: the depictions of bull and bear phases are mine, not hers) shows that large speculators, who are mainly hedge funds, have moved off a crowded long in commodity prices. The chart was produced by aggregating the Commitment of Data reports for all futures exchange traded commodities in the CRB Index.

My depiction of the bull and bear phases show that during the bear phases, neutral readings are good times to fade the rally. On the other hand, neutral readings are good opportunity to accumulate positions during the bull phases. The bull and bear phases is best exemplified by the chart of the bellwether of gold prices, which bottomed in 2002 along with the rest of the commodity complex.

Just because there is a neutral signal from this is a good time to accumulate positions doesn't mean that there isn't more downside to commodity prices. To see some near-term upside, you need a catalyst.

**Bullish CAT guidance the bullish catalyst?**

I have offered that one of the key indicators to watch for market direction is to watch 

[the corporate guidance and the body language from management during 1Q earnings season](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2012/01/global-healing-2012-vs-2009.html)

. A bullish catalyst appeared last week when Caterpillar, which is a cyclical company that does business worldwide,

[reported and gave guidance that was very upbeat](http://www.caterpillar.com/cda/files/3276340/7/Caterpillar+Inc.+4Q2011+Final.pdf)

 :

> We expect improving world economic growth to increase demand for commodities. Our outlook assumes most commodity prices will increase slightly in 2012 and continue at levels that encourage investment. We expect that copper will average over $4 per pound, Central Appalachian coal about $75 per ton and West Texas Intermediate crude oil about $100 per barrel.

In particular, mining will be a source of growth in 2012 and growth will be so high that supply will have a tough time with meeting demand:

> We expect mining to continue to be strong globally, and we have a sizable order backlog for mining equipment. We expect sales to increase in 2012 and are in the process of adding production capacity for many of our mining products. However, we expect sales to be constrained by capacity throughout 2012.

Moreover, the

 showed that the American economy continues to grow despite last week's disappointing GDP report:

CAT was bullish on the outlook for US housing:

> We expect total U.S. construction spending, which, net of inflation, has declined since 2004, to finally begin to recover in 2012\. We project a 1.5-percent increase in infrastructure-related construction and a 5-percent increase in nonresidential building construction. We are expecting housing starts of at least 700 thousand units in 2012, up from 607 thousand units in 2011.

They were sanguine on Europe because of ECB support of the eurozone:

> The Eurozone public debt crisis has been a lingering negative, but it is unlikely to trigger a worldwide recession. The Eurozone will likely have at least two quarters of weak, possibly negative growth, but should begin to improve in the second half of 2012\. For 2012, our outlook assumes economic growth for the Eurozone near zero and growth of about half of a percentage point for Europe in total.
> 
> Our expectation for improvement of European growth in the second half of 2012 rests on a continued easing by the European Central Bank (ECB). The ECB has recently lowered interest rates and could cut rates further in 2012.

CAT also saw sufficient growth in China to support construction demand and commodity growth:

> China took its first easing action in late 2011, and we expect that further easing is likely. We expect China's economy will grow 8.5 percent in 2012, sufficient for growth in construction and increased commodity demand.

In addition,

[Joe Weisenthal](http://www.businessinsider.com/wow-china-is-just-getting-started-2012-1)

highlighted some of the positive long-term fundamental drivers of Chinese commodity demand, namely a population that is rapidly becoming more affluent, which will raise demand for the consumer good life, such as electricity:

...and autos:

So there you have it:

*   A long-term rising demand for commodity prices from emerging market countries like China;
*   A neutral to moderately bullish sentiment environment for commodity prices; and
*   A forward looking bullish outlook from a global company that is highly exposed to cyclical growth.
