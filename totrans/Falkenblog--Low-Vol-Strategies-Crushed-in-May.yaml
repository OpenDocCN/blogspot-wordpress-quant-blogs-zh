    with anything, eg, if the rate rises it''s hardly testable because the old and
    new probability are couched merely as possibilities, and if the probability doesn''t
    change, that''s in the forecast too (''could'').  Now if they said, don''t buy
    or short strategy X this month, that would have been prescient.  I wonder if such
    people realize how disingenuous this is, or if they think their nuance is actually
    highly rigorous analysis.'

    many researchers to reassess the validity of this approach.  But, to put it in
    perspective, here's the total return over the past 12 months, using my beta data.

    beta has not.  As the SP500 rose 26% from May 31 2012 through May 31 2013, this
    is not surprising: on average, over shorter horizons like years, betas are accurate,
    so higher beta stocks do better in rising markets, lower beta portfolios underperform.
    For example, over the past year, given the SP500 rose 26%, low beta stocks rose
    70% of that, high beta 170% of that, implying betas of 0.7 and 1.7, which is totally
    consistent with the simple CAPM for the high beta stocks, and better-than-expected
    for the low beta portfolio (ie, its beta was 0.6 in that period).  If you bought
    low vol stocks not understanding this, well, you really need to.'

    over the past year. If you evaluate yourself purely against the indices, this
    is true: deviations from the benchmark are only good if they are above the benchmark.
     Yet, in simple Sharpe ratio or Information ratio, high beta portfolio did poorly,
    even in this period.  The clear winner is actually a Beta-1.0 portfolio, which
    has the highest Sharpe'
