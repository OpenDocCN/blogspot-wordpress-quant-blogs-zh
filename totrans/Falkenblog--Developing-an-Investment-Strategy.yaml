    the most active stocks, they include many

    market. Thus, the risk minimization from diversification implicit in indices is
    removed via leverage. Unfortunately, this does not amplify the ''equity risk premium''
    because the high amount of trading in these vehicles generates significantly drag
    longer term: being long the UltraPro S&P500 (UPRO) gives you three times the leverage
    against the S&P500 daily, but over the long run, a worse performance!'

    system. Develop rules, test them, write them down, and at the end of the year,
    evaluate your results. If you fail, perhaps give it another year. But after a
    few years, if you underperform standard benchmarks (eg, the SPY ETF), then either
    get out of the market, or stop trading, an simply invest in the SPY.

    strategies, mainly based on momentum over longer periods (eg, 200 days), and mean
    reversion over shorter horizons (eg, 3 days). There's a lot of empirical research
    that suggests these trends generally exist, in that momentum is one of the famous
    equity risk factors (from Jegadeesh and Titman), while mean reversion underlies
    a lot of 'stat arb' strategies. The issue is, can you use these facts to add alpha
    to a naive strategy of going long and forgetting about it.

    First, there are many nuances to any actual implementation, and if you play around
    enough something will work if only by chance. Thus, you have to be disciplined
    when testing these strategies because it is easy to find something if you try
    hard enough--torture the data enough and it will confess. Second, there are transaction
    costs. For a retail investor, I would assume a one-way cost of 2 cents a share.
    Make sure this cost is included in your performance results.

    are true, exit if this one condition holds). You can learn how to test strategies
    downloading daily Open-High-Low-Close from Yahoo!, and set up a spreadsheet to
    apply it to the past 5 or even 50 years of daily data. You may not like his specific
    rules, but it clues one in on what kinds of things people find useful, and if
    you can test his strategies, you are then in position to create your own, similar
    strategies.

    have a testable system. Maybe it''s based on fundamentals, but at least you should
    have a written record of what you were thinking, and when. The main thing to avoid
    is investing ad hoc every year,and not learning that you are wasting money and
    time. Most people are wasting their time at anything innovative: your average
    poet, screenwriter, trader. The key is to discover if you are in the ''talented
    tenth'' ASAP, because sampling alpha is costly.'

    after 2 up days when price is above the 200 day moving average), but the strategy:
    should you even be actively trading at all? Remember, odds are you will fail as
    demonstrated by the fact that most retail investors do not outperform the market,
    and neither do professional money managers. Do not assume that simply trying hard,
    or wanting it, are sufficient, because every money manager really wants to outperform,
    and most work quite hard. Don''t take it poorly, no one is good at everything,
    and very few are very good at more than a few things. The key is to find what
    you are good at so you can do it again and again, and this takes some courageous
    sampling, a good effort, and then a Hardheaded evaluation.'
