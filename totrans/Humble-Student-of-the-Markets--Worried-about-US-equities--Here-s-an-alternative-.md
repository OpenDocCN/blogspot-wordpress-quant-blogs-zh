# Humble Student of the Markets: Worried about US equities? Here's an alternative!

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2016/08/worried-about-us-equities-heres.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2016/08/worried-about-us-equities-heres.html#0001-01-01)

I have a suggestion for value oriented investors who are uncomfortable with my market blow-off thesis for US equities (see

[How to get in on the ground floor of a market bubble](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/07/10/how-to-get-in-on-the-ground-floor-of-a-market-bubble/)

and

[Get ready for the melt-up](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/07/31/get-ready-for-the-melt-up/)

). What about buying Europe?

Valuation metrics for European stocks are certainly cheaper. The 

[SP 500](https://ycharts.com/companies/SPY)

 trades at a price to book ratio of 2.7 and forward P/E 18.4. By contrast,

[FTSE Europe](https://ycharts.com/companies/VGK)

trades at a P/B of 1.6 and forward P/E of 15.9 and the 

[Euro Stoxx 50](https://ycharts.com/companies/FEZ)

 trades at a P/B of 1.3 and forward P/E of 13.5.
