    They are correct, however, in that most pundits probably do know more history,
    languages, and science than our president. I'm sure there are at least 100k normal
    people who have an IQ a standard deviation higher than Bush. Why are our leaders
    are so ‘slightly above average’? Because humans generally prefer reverse dominance
    hierarchies for their collectives.

    -- are characteristic of all non-human hominid societies (an extreme example being
    the tiny-testicled, alpha-male gorilla lording it over his band of mates) and
    are found in many other species of animal -- as in the proverbial pecking order
    among chickens, dogs, horses, seals, etc.

    overwhelming feature -- of every known civilization before modern times. It is
    a curious fact, therefore, that dominance hierarchies are rare in the ethnographic
    literature describing hunting-and-gathering societies -- and thus, presumably,
    also rare in hunting-and-gathering societies as they existed during much of our
    common evolutionary past.

    gist of his idea is that a love of dominance was so bred into the human species
    (males above all) during their long, shared hominid past, that they developed
    an innate distaste of being dominated by others. Thus armed with a motive, and
    using the cooperative skills which language and their big brains conferred upon
    them, all the lesser males in a group who were in danger of being dominated by
    an alpha male, would form a ‘reverse dominance hierarchy’ to put the would-be
    tyrant in his place. In this way, dominance behavior, while not eliminated entirely,
    could be moderated and dispersed.

    if they cannot, they seek to be equal’. Upstarts are put in their place in a variety
    of ways. For example, !Kung bushmen will mock the gift of someone, because they
    see gift giving as an attempt to signal superior status. In effect, they ridicule
    this act because they see it as a pretext (clever bushmen!). In more complex societies,
    groups of men actually kill the upstart for a crime conveniently determined. Thus,
    egalitarianism is an implication of this aversion to strong rulers.'

    words of politicians as if they were The Oracle at Delphi. Any real depth in these
    remarks is like reading one's anxieties into inkblots. If you read the text of
    any politician, the main feature is its blandness, the smarmy, recycled clichés
    that allow listeners to believe it means whatever they want it to. The president
    of the US, like the president of your senior class, or the general secretary of
    the UN, is someone chosen for his malleability and his simultaneous ability to
    appear non-malleable, as if we want him to be smart sounding but not smart. It's
    tolerable once you realize its comical.

    must admit that the main attribute of such ‘leaders’ is being ingratiating and
    non-threatening to the greatest number of people. Humans do not wish to have ‘rulers’
    with high intelligence or education, because these people would be less controllable.

    Hitchens. Immediately it was obvious this was a bad idea, because these people
    have strong, educated opinions, and even I would find their elevation annoying
    because on the many issues where they and I disagree, they would too skillfully
    frame the debate disadvantageously to my side. Having a somewhat thoughtful, but
    not too thoughtful, person ‘leading’ the debate is a necessary compromise.
