# Magmasystems Blog: We are hiring again

Even though you may be reading about layoffs on Wall Street, we still have openings in Equities IT for developers and technologists who are very smart and are passionate about technology. Business experience preferred (Risk, Trading, Analytics, CEP). The positions can be in New York City, in Jersey City, or in Warren, NJ. Java or .NET.

I still have openings for a great UI developer (we are moving to WPF) who has experience with real-time systems, and a more "analytical" person who can analyze flowing equities trading and risk data in real-time and come up with interesting trading decisions.

Email me if you are interested.
