- en: The total return to Momentum was impressive for many decades. It's a simple
    strategy, basically going long past winners and short the losers, hoping they
    continue to win and lose. Interestingly, the past returns should go only up to
    the prior month, because there's slight mean-reversion at the one-month horizon,
    so most people use the returns from months t-12 through t-1\. This highlights
    the non-fractal nature of stock returns, in that there's momentum in the data
    from 3-18 months, but mean-reversion at the shorter and longer frequencies.

    1932 through 1943 it stagnated, it seemed Madoff-like in its ascendance from the
    end of WW2 through 2000.

- en: The big drawdowns in the momentum strategy occurred in the big stock rebounds
    of July-Aug 1932, and March-Sep 2009\. These moves would generate losses of over
    50%, which since it generated an 8% annual return, this would probably eliminate
    any particular portfolio manager--such losses are usually lethal.

- en: Now, these long-term simulations tend to have a bunch of survivorship problem
    issues, and data prior to 1964 is to be taken with a grain of salt (the database
    was created then, so its much harder to correct errors when you don't remember
    how you collected data in real-time). Interestingly, while momentum is considered
    a real factor by some (eg, the Carhart 4-factor model is the Fama-French 3-factor
    model plus momentum), Fama has been conspicuously avoided treating momentum as
    a risk factor, nor trying to explain in theoretically in any way, and just looked
    at it quizzically. That was rather refreshing, in that it's tempting when you
    have the status he does to explain everything in your field, but instead he just
    shrugged.

    a real story here. The idea was that winners had taxable gains, and so not selling
    them until January would push off a liability; losers had losses that selling
    prior to January would lower one''s taxes. Thus winners have this absence of selling,
    losers a greater amount of selling. Alas, since 2003, this pattern too has disappeared.
    In fact, I actually put the trade in December 2003 based on looking at this data,
    and got crushed. It was the worst return by far relative to my sample of 25 years
    that used a different universe than French but was basically the same pattern.
    I actually emailed Ken French at that time to ask if he had any insight, and he
    merely emailed back: ''it''s risky.'' My boss didn''t think that was a good answer.'

- en: I think this highlights an important point. At any point in time your strategy
    is susceptible to a draw down that could cost you your client base. You can't
    just say 'hey, that's risk!' Investors see it as a failure, not a bad draw from
    the urn of chance. Returns over time are treated very differently than cross-sectional
    returns because cross sectional returns have covariances and volatilities amenable
    to statistical optimization; time-series returns are looked at more like datum
    in a broader strategy of eliminating all the 'losers' at any point in time. If
    you are in the bottom 10% at any time for any reason, your portfolio probably
    has hit an 'absorbing barrier.'
