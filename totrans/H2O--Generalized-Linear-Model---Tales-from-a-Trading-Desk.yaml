    over on GitHub offer a great intro to leveraging GLM to make predictions.  Which
    leads to the following possibly data sets which could possibly have predictions
    made on them:'

    ago.  If you have an organisation modelled from the perspective of projects and
    teams, can you now begin to make an assessment around team productivity?  Part
    of the underlying issue around these data sets, unlike historical airline data
    sets, is that there is possibly a higher chance of the data being gamed.

    using various algorithms/models, it was possible to predict with any degree of
    certainty if a team would deliver on an iteration, or if a team member being sick,
    impacted the team itself from delivering successful “Done” stories.
