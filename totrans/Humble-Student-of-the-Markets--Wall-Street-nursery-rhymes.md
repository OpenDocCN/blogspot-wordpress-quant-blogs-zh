# Humble Student of the Markets: Wall Street nursery rhymes

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2008/03/wall-street-nursery-rhymes_13.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2008/03/wall-street-nursery-rhymes_13.html#0001-01-01)

It's Friday. For your amusement I reproduce some of the traditional nursery rhymes adopted to a Wall Street theme that we used to recite and sing to our daughter:

**The five little piggies**

This little piggy put in a market order...

This little piggy put in a limit order...

This little piggy traded derivatives...

This little piggy traded cash [market]...

And this little piggy got caught insider trading and went

wee wee wee wee wee...

...all the way to Club Fed.

**Old MacDonald**

Old MacDonald had a farm,

Ee-ii-ee-ii-oo,

On this farm he had an investment banker,

Ee-ii-ee-ii-oo,

And a S

*trong Buy*

here and a S

*trong Buy*

there

Here a

*Buy*

there a

*Buy*

Everywhere a

*Strong Buy*

!

Old MacDonald had a farm

Ee-ii-ee-ii-oo...

Happy Friday!
