    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

- en: In his outlook for the national economy, UCLA Anderson senior economist David
    Shulman notes that while the global economy started out strong in 2018, signs
    of its weakening will likely be everywhere by year’s end. “The weakness is being
    amplified by the protectionist policies being employed by the Trump administration
    and the uncertainties associated with Brexit,” he writes. “This economic weakness
    has triggered a major contraction in global interest rates, making it difficult
    for the Fed to conduct its normalization policy, and has put a lid on long-term
    interest rates.

    in 2018, growth will slow to 1.7 percent in 2019 to a near-recession pace of 1.1
    percent in 2020,” Shulman adds. “However, by mid-2021, growth is forecast to be
    around 2 percent.” Payroll employment growth will decline from its monthly record
    of 220,000 to about 160,000 per month in 2019 and a negligible 20,000 per month
    in 2020, with actual declines occurring at the end of that year. In this environment,
    the unemployment rate will initially decline from 3.9 percent in January to 3.6
    percent later in the year and then gradually rise to 4.2 percent in early 2021.
