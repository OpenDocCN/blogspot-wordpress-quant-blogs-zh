    as a fear gauge.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I have few opinions on the seasonality of the VIX, though last week has historically
    been a weak one for S&P 500 returns. However, I beg to differ on the use of the
    VIX as a fear gauge.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That’s because the VIX Index was not designed to be a fear indicator. It was
    designed to measure the implied volatility of a series of at-the-money options
    with a 1-month time horizon. While some analysts have seized upon implied volatility
    for use as a fear gauge, the index was never intended for use that way.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Indeed, the current explosion in 0DTE trading, or options that expire the same
    day, makes a 1-month implied volatility have less utility as a sentiment indicator.
    Arguably, VXST, or the 9-day VIX, is more useful to measure short-term sentiment.
    The accompanying chart shows that VXST was faster to spike in the current instance
    than VIX. The term structure of the VIX-VXST curve shows an inversion, which is
    an indication of fear appearing in the market.

    short-term bottom.
