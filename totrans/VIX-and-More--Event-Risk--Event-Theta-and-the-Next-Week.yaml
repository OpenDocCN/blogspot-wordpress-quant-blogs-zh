- en: Weekends pose an interesting set of problems for the investor/trader, particularly
    when there is an ongoing crisis or a reasonable risk that a new crisis lurks around
    the corner. Today we have a perplexing situation in which there is both an old
    crisis (government shutdown) and a new crisis just around the corner ([debt ceiling](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/debt%20ceiling)
    limit), as well as the increasing likelihood that the two of these are going to
    merge into one bigger crisis.

  zh: 对于投资者/交易员来说，周末带来了一系列有趣的问题，特别是在存在正在进行中的危机或合理的风险下周会有新的危机的情况下。今天我们面临一个令人困惑的局面，既有老危机（政府关门），又有新危机即将来临（[债务上限](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/debt%20ceiling)限制），这两个危机越来越有可能合并成一场更大的危机。
- en: How should an investor think about this situation? First, they need to form
    some opinions about event risk, including a range of scenarios from a quick and
    comprehensive resolution of the government shutdown and the debt ceiling to prolonged
    gridlock that results in the U.S. defaulting on its obligations. The fun part
    is assigning probabilities to these scenarios, coming up with a probability weighted
    view of the future and making (semi-)rational decisions about portfolio protection
    and speculative opportunities after considering risk and potential reward. Sounds
    like a snap, doesn’t it?

  zh: 投资者应该如何看待当前形势？首先，他们需要对事件风险形成一些看法，包括从政府关门和债务上限的快速全面解决到导致美国违约的长期僵局的一系列情景。有趣的是，为这些情景分配概率，提出一个以概率为权重的未来观点，并在考虑风险和潜在收益后做出（半）理性的投资组合保护和投机机会决策。听起来很简单，不是吗？
- en: Some investors may not fully appreciate that event risk or [event volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/event%20volatility)
    is a two-sided sword. Sure, there is risk that many of us have once again overestimated
    a bunch of elected ~~lemmings~~ officials and their ability to act in the best
    interests of their country and in so doing reprise those wonderful memories from
    August 2011, but there is also the risk that some progress – or even a small sign
    that the tide is turning – could unfold over the weekend and cause stocks to soar
    on Monday as short-sellers absorb the brunt of the damage. Attaching a meaningful
    probability to these scenarios may seem futile, but running through the scenarios
    in one’s head to see what the implications are is certainly worth a little bit
    of spare brainpower.

  zh: 一些投资者可能没有完全认识到事件风险或[事件波动性](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/event%20volatility)是一把双刃剑。当然，有很大风险我们再次高估了许多被选举出来的官员的能力，让他们代表国家和我们重温2011年8月那些美好的记忆，但也有风险，周末可能会有所进展——甚至是一个小小的迹象表明形势正在转变——从而使股票在周一随着空头吸收大部分损失而飙升。为这些情景分配一个有意义的概率可能看起来是徒劳的，但在脑海中演练这些情景以了解其含义肯定是值得花一点多余的脑力的。
- en: Just a few months before the 2011 debt ceiling crisis, there was the three-pronged
    crisis that hit Japan, combining an earthquake, tsunami and nuclear meltdown.
    I talked about this crisis in [Fukushima Daiichi and Event Theta](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2011/03/fukushima-daiichi-and-event-theta.html)
    and even invented a new term, “[event theta](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/event%20theta),”
    to describe whether the passage of time was a positive or negative development
    for those with positions in volatility or other instruments.

  zh: 在2011年债务上限危机前三个月，日本遭受了地震、海啸和核泄漏的三重危机。我在[福岛第一核电站与事件θ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2011/03/fukushima-daiichi-and-event-theta.html)一文中谈到了这次危机，甚至发明了一个新术语，“[事件θ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/event%20theta)，”来描述时间推移对于那些在波动性或其他工具中持仓的人来说是积极还是消极的发展。
- en: '*“As these events unfolded, seemingly like a slow-motion train wreck, I kept
    asking myself whether time was in favor of or working against the efforts of those
    who were trying to limit the damage to the nuclear facility and surrounding areas.
    In other words, was this a positive theta event (time in our favor) or a negative
    theta event (a fight against the clock.) Not being an expert in the field of nuclear
    energy and knowing that certain factors could spiral out of control quickly, but
    also knowing that efforts were underway to stabilize some of the processes in
    the plant, I was left to guessing whether current efforts were more likely to
    fall short and result in a vicious cycle or were expected to stem the problem
    and turn the tide in favor of the rescue team.*'

  zh: “在这些事件逐步展开时，似乎像是一出慢动作的火车出轨，我一直问自己时间是否站在那些试图限制核设施及其周边地区损害的人一边，或者说，这是否是一个正的时间theta事件（时间对我们有利）还是一个负的时间theta事件（与时间赛跑）。我不是核能领域的专家，知道某些因素可能会迅速失控，但同时也知道工厂中的一些过程正在进行稳定化努力，我只能猜测当前的努力更有可能功亏一篑，导致恶性循环，还是有望遏制问题，使救援队伍的形势转危为安。

- en: '*Knowing whether this was a positive or negative theta event also has substantial
    implications for investment strategies. From a hedging perspective, event theta
    could influence the selection of hedging vehicles, the anticipated timing for
    those hedges, how the hedges might be structured and what sort of prices might
    be appropriate. For the speculative investor, event theta can also help to determine
    the risk-reward payoff structure and how it varies over time. Anyone who trades
    in VIX futures and deals with the VIX term structure on a daily basis should have
    some insights into potential mismatches between event theta and term structure.”*'

  zh: 知道这是否是一个正的时间theta事件或负的时间theta事件对投资策略有重大影响。从对冲的角度来看，事件theta可能会影响对冲工具的选择，预计的对冲时机，对冲可能如何构建以及适当的定价。对于投机性投资者来说，事件theta还可以帮助确定风险回报支付结构以及随时间如何变化。任何交易VIX期货并每日处理VIX期限结构的人都应该对事件theta与期限结构之间的潜在不匹配有一些见解。”
- en: I suspect that for most of this week, event theta has been negative, meaning
    that the passage of time without meaningful progress toward an agreement was bearish
    for equities and bullish for holders of long volatility positions. With the weekend
    coming up and another two plus days of the news cycle, polling data and behind-the-scenes
    strategizing, it may be that event theta is closer to neutral and perhaps even
    positive. This is not to say that shorts should cover their positions before today’s
    close or anyone with a long volatility position should close out their positions
    and take profits, only to point out that at least until markets open again on
    Monday, risk for longs and shorts is becoming more balanced and determining the
    risk-reward payoff for a variety of positions is a much more difficult proposition.

  zh: 我认为在本周的大部分时间里，事件theta都是负面的，这意味着在没有实质性进展接近协议的情况下，时间的流逝对股市不利，对长期波动性头寸的持有者有利。随着周末的来临，还有另外两天多的新闻周期，民意调查数据和幕后策略，事件theta可能更接近中性，甚至可能是积极的。这并不是说空头应该在本交易日结束前平仓他们的头寸，或者任何持有长期波动性头寸的人都应该平仓获利，只是指出，至少在周一市场开盘之前，多头和空头风险变得更加平衡，确定各种头寸的风险回报支付变得更加困难。

    2011 debt ceiling crisis, the 2012 [sequestration](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/sequestration)
