    means that he publishes very rigorous and well-received papers showing that some
    strange result is a function of risk, even though that risk metric is totally
    nonintuitive. Case in point, Campbell, Giglio, Polk, and Turley (2012) have a
    paper entitled

    VIX changes. One would think you can't get blood out of that stone, that if the
    positive market risk premium has a large negative weight, then something with
    a small positive effect would not explain the value effect. Then again, you are
    probably not familiar with the powerful modern econometric methods that economists
    sling around.

    ratio, yield curve spread, a value portfolio, and the Baa-Aaa yield spread) and
    create a Vector Auto Regression. This VAR is used to estimated returns and volatility
    that are used to estimate how much risk value/growth portfolios have. This method
    uses a closed form (!) solution to a model that uses the 'risk aversion coefficient',
    which is great because it gives you another free parameter, and is a neat mathematical
    trick. Campbell et al. casually note "the empirical implementation of our model
    is a success," because there exist "reasonable preference parameters that would
    make a long-term investor" not jump into value stocks even though they seem to
    generate a return premium.

    volatility risk factors can explain the value premium given certain unobserved
    parameters. Stock return premiums and volatility by themselves, however, do not
    explain anything.
