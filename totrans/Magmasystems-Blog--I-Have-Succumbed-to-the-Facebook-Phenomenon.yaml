    The kids have a word called "teenile", which refers to an adult who tried to act
    like a teenager. I vowed that nobody woul dever describe me a teenile.

    what my kids were up to. However, since I had to "friend" my kids in order to
    see what they were doing, and since any sensible kid will never accept a friend
    request from his folks, then I just let my Facebook account lie dormant. Over
    the years, I have received friend requests from various tangential business associates,
    but I have always ignored these.

    my high school graduating class (and the class directly before and after mine)
    established Facebook groups, complete with photos. Then, a few old girlfriends
    managed to track me down and sent me Facebook links to photo albums of me in somewhat
    embarassing situations. Then, a few of my college buddies. who I still see, got
    themselves up on Facebook.
