# Humble Student of the Markets: A major correction, or just a flesh wound?

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2020/06/a-major-correction-or-just-flesh-wound.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2020/06/a-major-correction-or-just-flesh-wound.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models**

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post,

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The

**Trend Asset Allocation Model**

is an asset allocation model which applies trend following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or contraction (bearish)?"

My inner trader uses a

**trading model**

, which is a blend of price momentum (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa). Subscribers receive real-time alerts of model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of the those email alerts are updated weekly

. The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that began in March 2016 is shown below.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Sell equities*
*   Trend Model signal: Neutral*
*   Trading model: Neutral*

**Just a flesh wound?**

Was the market's -5.9% one-day swoon last Thursday the start of a major correction, or just

[a flesh wound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAW6D21ICdg)

?

The SPX exhibited an island reversal last week while violating a key rising trend line that went back to the March bottom, which are bearish. On the other hand, it successfully tested its 200 day moving average (dma), and the VIX Index (bottom panel) recycled from above its upper Bollinger Band (BB), which is an oversold reading, to below, which are constructive signs for the bull case.

What's next? The market had been rising steadily so long that it's difficult to ascertain the short or intermediate term trend. The strength of an uptrend is not known until it is tested in a pullback.
