    in a cubicle hit the wrong button on his HP12-C. Doh! Alas, it is not the case.
    Any error this pervasive is not from some obscure assumption, but an assumption
    that everyone was comfortable with. If an obscure technical assumption drove investors
    into various bonds, there should be a large group of investors who would have
    quants who disagreed, and they would have not been exposed. That is, quants may
    have no common sense, but on

    the 5th digit of Pi was 6.

    that everyone seemed to think was reasonable, something quants did not have the

    Housing Bubble, where he notes that recent housing price increases '''

    doing something, and think it''s right, the quants will perforce generate supporting
    documentation. Scientists in that way are like lawyers, advocates, not for a paid
    client, but rather, the ephemeral verities of the current zeitgeist. With $4B
    for global warming research, and much less for anti-global warming research, it
    is no surprise many scientists are documenting various evidence of global warming:
    people like the results, they aren''t as skeptical, more likely to get published,
    get a grant, get on a government project, etc.'

- en: UBS used a 10-day Value-at-Risk on its residential mortgage backed portfolio
    to assess its risk, using data from the benign 2000-2005 period. This was an error.
    But UBS was going to invest in mortgages anyway, because presumably this collateral
    does not decline much if ever, so this was all standard rationalization of preconceived
    objectives.

    CDO world relied almost exclusively on this copula-based correlation model". Well,
    derivatives textbook authors might like to believe that their formulas underlie
    most financial activity, but I suspect the number of people using copulas in their
    sales pitch was low, no more than 5%, because most investors, big shots who actually
    make portfolio decisions, do not like pretentious mathematics. Perfunctory metrics
    may be ubiquitous, but they are still perfunctory. The decision makers are rich,
    powerful, kind of smart, do not feel embarrassed by their lack of knowledge in
    obscure technical trivia, and surely are not intimidated by it. Of that limited
    set, the copula itself, irrespective of the broader knowledge about mortgages
    and housing price trends, was probably the driver of 10% of those purchases, because
    even for investors who like formulas, most require a bigger picture. Thus, I generously
    estimate about 0.5% of all mortgages were bought because of David Li's Frankenstein
    formula.

    deviations, means, and Microsoft Excel's 'solver'. These concepts can get tricky,
    but the basic assumption in the mortgage crisis, that housing prices would not
    fall significantly, was not tricky, and people with the authority to make decisions
    were not swayed by these technical issues, rather, they used them to validate
    their earlier beliefs.
