    in a cubicle hit the wrong button on his HP12-C. Doh! Alas, it is not the case.
    Any error this pervasive is not from some obscure assumption, but an assumption
    that everyone was comfortable with. If an obscure technical assumption drove investors
    into various bonds, there should be a large group of investors who would have
    quants who disagreed, and they would have not been exposed. That is, quants may
    have no common sense, but on

    doing something, and think it''s right, the quants will perforce generate supporting
    documentation. Scientists in that way are like lawyers, advocates, not for a paid
    client, but rather, the ephemeral verities of the current zeitgeist. With $4B
    for global warming research, and much less for anti-global warming research, it
    is no surprise many scientists are documenting various evidence of global warming:
    people like the results, they aren''t as skeptical, more likely to get published,

- en: UBS used a 10-day Value-at-Risk on its residential mortgage backed portfolio
    to assess its risk, using data from the benign 2000-2005 period. This was an error.
    But UBS was going to invest in mortgages anyway, because presumably this collateral
    does not decline much if ever, so this was all standard rationalization of preconceived
    objectives.

- en: He then quotes some quants, like Darrell Duffie, who states that "corporate
    CDO world relied almost exclusively on this copula-based correlation model". Well,
    derivatives textbook authors might like to believe that their formulas underlie
    most financial activity, but I suspect the number of people using copulas in their
    sales pitch was low, no more than 5%, because most investors, big shots who actually
    make portfolio decisions, do not like pretentious mathematics. Perfunctory metrics
    may be ubiquitous, but they are still perfunctory. The decision makers are rich,
    powerful, kind of smart, do not feel embarrassed by their lack of knowledge in
    obscure technical trivia, and surely are not intimidated by it. Of that limited
    set, the copula itself, irrespective of the broader knowledge about mortgages
    and housing price trends, was probably the driver of 10% of those purchases, because
    even for investors who like formulas, most require a bigger picture. Thus, I generously
    estimate about 0.5% of all mortgages were bought because of David Li's Frankenstein
    formula.

  zh: 他引用了一些量化分析师，比如达雷尔·达菲（Darrell Duffie），他表示“公司CDO世界几乎完全依赖于这种基于协同分布的相关模型”。嗯，衍生品教科书的作者可能会认为他们的公式支撑了大多数金融活动，但我怀疑用协同分布来推销的人数很少，不超过5%，因为大多数投资者，实际上做出投资组合决策的大人物，不喜欢做作的数学。敷衍的指标可能无处不在，但它们仍然是敷衍的。决策者富有，有权势，也有点聪明，不会因为对晦涩的技术琐事知之甚少而感到尴尬，当然也不会被它吓到。在那个有限的范围内，协同分布本身，与抵押贷款和住房价格趋势的更广泛知识无关，可能推动了这些购买的10%，因为即使对公式感兴趣的投资者，多数也需要更全面的图片。因此，我慷慨地估计，大约0.5%的所有抵押贷款是因为李大卫的弗兰肯斯坦公式购买的。
- en: Copulas, value at risk, correlations, credit scores, one might add standard
    deviations, means, and Microsoft Excel's 'solver'. These concepts can get tricky,
    but the basic assumption in the mortgage crisis, that housing prices would not
    fall significantly, was not tricky, and people with the authority to make decisions
    were not swayed by these technical issues, rather, they used them to validate
    their earlier beliefs.

  zh: 协同分布、风险价值、相关性、信用评分，还可以添加标准差、均值和微软Excel的“Solver”。这些概念可能会变得棘手，但在抵押危机中的基本假设，即房价不会出现显著下跌，不是棘手的，而且有权做出决定的人也不会因这些技术问题而摇摆不定，相反，他们利用这些问题来验证自己先前的信念。
