# Humble Student of the Markets: Yes, but will this get by Compliance?

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2008/12/yes-but-will-this-get-by-compliance.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2008/12/yes-but-will-this-get-by-compliance.html#0001-01-01)

Blogging will be light until the end of the year. In the meantime, let me leave you with this Seasons Greetings (which hopefully gets through Compliance):

> Please accept with no obligation, implied or implicit my best wishes for an environmentally conscious, socially responsible, low stress, non-addictive, gender neutral, celebration of the winter solstice holiday, practiced within the most enjoyable traditions of the religious persuasion of your choice, or secular practices of your choice, with respect for the religious/secular traditions at all…and a fiscally successful, personally fulfilling and medically uncomplicated recognition of the onset accepted calendar year 2009, but without due respect for the calendars of choice of others, and without regard to the race, creed, color, age, physical ability, religious faith, or sexual orientation of the wishee.
> 
> By accepting this greeting, you are accepting these terms:
> 
> This greeting is subject to clarification or withdrawal. It is freely transferable with no alteration to the original greeting. It implies no promise by the wisher to actually implement any of the wishes for him/herself or others and is void where prohibited by law and is revocable at the sole discretion of the wisher. This wish is warranted to perform as expected within the usual application of good tidings for a period of one year, or until the issuance of a subsequent holiday greeting, whichever comes first and warranty is limited to replacement of this wish or the issuance of a new wish at the sole discretion of the wisher.

BEST WISHES AND HAVE A GREAT NEW YEAR!
