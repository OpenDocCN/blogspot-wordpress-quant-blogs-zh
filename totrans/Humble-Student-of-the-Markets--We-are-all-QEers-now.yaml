    decade, the unintended effects of Keynesian stimulus were plain to see for everyone
    as inflation raced upwards and out of control.

    later in the week, we are all Quantitative Easers. The Bank of Japan, Federal
    Reserve, the European Central Bank and Bank of England have all embraced quantitative
    easing, or money printing. Recently, both the BoE and BoJ have announced further
    rounds of quantitative easing.

    Fed's ZIRP and quantitative easing. In 2011, the US paid $454 billion in interest
    payments under ZIRP and, despite skyrocketing debt, interest expect was less than
    it was in parts of the 1990's.

    bankers are engaged in QE, and risk off, when they are not. The endgame will either
    inflation or debt default - and I don't know what the result will be.

    off backdrop and participating in the trend of the day. Right now, central bankers
    are engaged in another round of QE around the world. Despite what you may think
    of the ultimate costs of such policies, the right thing for an investor to do
    is to party and worry about the consequences later.
