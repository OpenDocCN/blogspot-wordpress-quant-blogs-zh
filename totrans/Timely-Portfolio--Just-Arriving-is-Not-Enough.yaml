    Almost all passengers want the ride to be super smooth and will sacrifice convenience
    and an on-time arrival to ensure comfort and perceived safety.  Also, passengers
    expect pilots to make this decision for them.  Like a pilot, I feel as a money
    manager, I bear the responsibility for the smoothness of my clients’ financial
    journey.  Unlike a pilot though, I have a much more significant burden since my
    clients can pull the emergency release as soon as they experience any discomfort. 
    Exiting due to panic or lack of confidence means my clients possibly make a financially
    fatal decision and either arrive late or never at their financial destination,
    so I must be even more cautious to not test the limits of my clients’ comfort.

    when the skies are unclear and the bumps severe, I need to take a different route
    (allocation) or not fly at all (sit in cash).  I would rather my client arrive
    a little late than to pull the emergency release and not arrive at all.  Pilots
    do not control the weather, and I do not control the markets, but we both must
    properly gauge conditions and make the decision to sacrifice convenience and an
    on-time arrival for a safe and comforable arrival.

    does not seem to agree with my money management philosophy.  On the first manager
    Bill Nygren I see “Oakmark''s 4 percent loss in 2007, and to a more dismal drop
    of 36 percent in 2008,” and these devastating drawdowns persist through the all
    four managers.  What troubles me most is how quickly the press and investors forgive
    pitiful performance and awful drawdowns in the crisis. These investors neither
    foresaw nor controlled the almost $10 trillion in political and monetary decisions
    required to temporarily rescue them. Here is a look at the mentioned funds.  Most
    of these managers simply avoided tech stocks in 2000-2003, but did nothing to
    avoid the far more severe disaster of 2007-2009.'

    in the next cycle as these managers, their investors, and the press learned nothing
    from the last crisis.
