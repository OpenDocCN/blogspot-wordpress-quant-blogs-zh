    your selection process. A top-down manager should probably use a risk model that
    focuses mainly on macro-economic risk factors to analyze his portfolio. A traditional
    bottom-up stock selector or sector rotator might want to use a fundamental factor
    model, such as the one pioneered by

    to analyze and understand their risk exposures. Others take the additional step
    of asking the risk model to construct the portfolio for them through an optimization
    process. This quantitative technique may not be suitable for investors with fundamentally
    driven processes as this group often have trouble numerically specifying many
    of the inputs to the optimizer.'

- en: Managers who use optimization need to understand the nuances of the optimizer
    and how it interacts with the forecast alphas. I would use the analogy of being
    a painter and knowing what you want to paint. A quant with an index-plus, or a
    low tracking error active mandate, will keep the risk aversion parameter high
    with fairly low forecast alphas. This would be the equivalent of painting a series
    of subtle colors with smooth transitions between colors.

- en: One of the frustrations of the optimizer output from index-plus style optimizations
    is that the optimizer will often replace one stock ranked "hold" with another
    that is ranked "hold" for risk control reasons. If the intent is a to build a
    "pedal-to-the-metal" portfolio, then the manager needs to take steps to emphasize
    the tails, or extremes, of the forecast alpha score distributions. In other words,
    only buy stocks ranked "buy" and sell stocks ranked "sell". This would be the
    equivalent of painting a bright colorful mosaic, compared to the dull but subtle
    colors of the index-plus mandate.
