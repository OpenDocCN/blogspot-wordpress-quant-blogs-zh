- en: Executives at large financial corporations tend to be smarmy bureaucrats, not
    savvy investors. They rise to the top via excellent credentials, good connections,
    better timing, and learning to not say anything so clearly as to betray their
    ignorance on things large and small. Ina Drew sounds like a Dilbert caricature.

  zh: 大型金融公司的高管往往是肤浅的官僚，而不是精明的投资者。他们通过优异的学历、良好的人脉、更好的时机上升至高位，学会不明确地表达任何大大小小的事情，不以泄露自己对事物的无知。

    quarter of this year? How could such a large position be 'folded into the aggregate
    risk of the unit' yet be marked to market?  I suspect she understood it as so
    many senior executives do, which is, not very well. They then discuss how they
    tried to close the position by putting on a correlated position going the other
    way. Clearly this didn't work as expected, which means it was a bad hedge, clearly
    in the CIO's bailiwick.

  zh: 对一个首席投资官来说，怎么会不明白今年第一季度的轻微波动会发生什么？如此巨大的头寸怎么会'合并到了整个部门的总风险'而且还做了按市值计算？ 我怀疑她对此的理解就跟许多高级管理人员一样，也就是说，不是很好。然后他们讨论了他们如何通过建立一个与之相对的头寸来关闭头寸。很明显，这并没有如预期那样奏效，这意味着这是一个糟糕的对冲，显然在首席投资官的权力范围之内。
