    savvy investors. They rise to the top via excellent credentials, good connections,
    better timing, and learning to not say anything so clearly as to betray their
    ignorance on things large and small. Ina Drew sounds like a Dilbert caricature.

    that anyone with an edge in interest rate forecasting is deluded, ignorant, or
    not a corporate executive. That's just not where those kind of people end up.
    An executive who thinks calling market direction is really important doesn't understand

    scenario,” he said...One serious defect in the risk evaluation of Iksil’s position
    was that its limit was folded into the aggregate risk of the unit’s entire portfolio.
    In other words, Iksil could continue to increase the position without triggering

    quarter of this year? How could such a large position be 'folded into the aggregate
    risk of the unit' yet be marked to market?  I suspect she understood it as so
    many senior executives do, which is, not very well. They then discuss how they
    tried to close the position by putting on a correlated position going the other
    way. Clearly this didn't work as expected, which means it was a bad hedge, clearly
    in the CIO's bailiwick.
