    underlying conditions significantly improve a system’s chances of outperforming
    buy-and-hold.  Also, I have found very little discussion, so maybe R with some
    help from ttrTests can help answer my question of when I should just go buy-and-hold
    (a very pleasant situation for a money manager).  Starting in this business in
    1998, I have often said that I dream of a day when I can just buy and hold similar
    to Japan stocks 1980-1990, US stocks 1990-2000, and US bonds 1982-now.

- en: Those who follow my blog or know me already understand my obsession with drawdown,
    but that obsession focuses more on client/manager psychology [(Investing for the
    Long Run)](http://ssrn.com/abstract=1958258) rather than drawdown’s effects on
    tactical systems.  I do not understand the industry’s focus on standard deviation. 
    I have never had a client call me or even worse fire me because my standard deviation
    has increased.  I know the argument is that higher standard deviations lead to
    higher drawdown, but as I show later in the post, this does not seem to be the
    case.

- en: Clients call me or fire me because they have lost money, so if I can minimize
    the frequency, amplitude, and duration of drawdowns, then I can help/guide the
    client and reduce the worry, which is one main reason why they are paying me. 
    Also, though I think that focusing on minimizing drawdown can meaningfully increase
    the chances of achieving their long term return objectives ([Drawdown Control
    Can Also Determine Ending Wealth](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2011/07/drawdown-control-can-also-determine.html)

    "Confidence, Ending Equity, and What I Can Do as the Money Manager")), which is
    even more likely the reason why clients pay me.

    To start the testing I thought I would use the fine work of [David St. John](http://www.math.uic.edu/mslc/?sid=profile&unid=dstjoh2)
    on ttrTests ([ttrTests 4th and Final Test](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2011/10/ttrtests-4th-and-final-test.html))
    to get 100,000 bootstrapped samples from monthly S&P 500 data to examine drawdown,
    standard deviation, skewness, and compound returns on buy-and-hold versus a [Mebane
    Faber 10-month moving average system](http://www.mebanefaber.com).  Since I am
    so biased, I will let you determine the significance of drawdown on the results.

    not necessarily cause worse drawdowns. However, it is interesting that higher
    standard deviation has as high a correlation as drawdown with system out(under)performance
    (bottom right).
