# Humble Student of the Markets: More of the usual Eurocrisis drama

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2013/03/more-of-usual-eurocrisis-drama.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2013/03/more-of-usual-eurocrisis-drama.html#0001-01-01)

So the Cypriot parliament has rejected the terms of the Troika's rescue deal. Their finance minister is in Moscow and there were stories floating about that the quid pro quo for a Russian rescue of Cyprus would be a Russian naval base (via

[Business Insider](http://www.businessinsider.com/russia-may-want-a-cyprus-naval-port-in-exchange-for-a-bailout-2013-3)

). Should the EU and NATO be concerned?

I don't think so. The Russians had a chance to expand their geopolitical footprint in November but they passed. Here is what I wrote back then (see

[Europe dodges another bullet (Not the Catalan election)](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2012/11/europe-dodges-another-bullet-no-its-not.html)

) [emphasis added]:

> The wild card that I had been watching for is for Greece to turn to Russia instead of the Troika for financing. What if the Greeks got tired of the pain and turned to Putin for relief? Moscow has long had a historical desires for the warm waters of the Mediterranean for centuries. A financing deal could have shook up NATO and significantly shifted the geopolitical balance in the Eastern Med.
> 
> ***The test case was Cyprus.*** Russian nationals have a large presence on that island. As its banks got into trouble because they were stuffed full of Greek debt, the Cyprus economy was in peril. As the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/19/world/europe/cyprus-counts-on-its-close-ties-to-russia.html) reported in June:
> 
> > The Russian government last year gave Cyprus a three-year loan of 2.5 billion euros, or $3.1 billion at the current exchange rate, at a below-market rate of 4.5 percent to help it service its debt. Cyprus now needs at least 1.8 billion euros, or $2.3 billion, by the end of this month to buttress its ailing banking sector.
> 
> Instead of turning to the EU, they turned to Russia [emphasis added]:
> 
> > Now many on this tiny island nation, whose banks and government are facing economic insolvency, are hoping for financial salvation from Russia rather than Germany and the European Union.
> > 
> > “I would much rather be saved by Moscow,” said Elena Tsolia, 30, an attendant at the department store Debenhams, where Russian shoppers snap up bottles of Dior and Chanel perfume. “***We are a small island and we don’t want to be owned by Germany***.”

I speculated that Russia could have not only rescued Cyprus, but Greece in return for naval basing rights:

> Cyprus would have been the test case of Russia flexing its financial and geopolitical muscle in the Eastern Med.
> 
> Today Nicosia, tomorrow Athens? Can you say "Russian Black Sea fleet base in Athens, or Crete"?

So what happened? Cyprus turned back to the Troika instead of Moscow:

> A little noticed announcement came across my desk. The headline was [CYPRUS Government - Troika reach agreement](http://www.financialmirror.com/news-details.php?nid=28175):
> 
> > The Government of the Republic of Cyprus informed on the 25th of June 2012 the appropriate European Authorities of its decision to submit to euro area Member States a request of financial assistance from the EFSF/ESM.

Any talk of a rescue from Moscow is likely just that - talk. The Russians demonstrated their lack of interest in November when they had the chance.

**Cypriot crisis tripwires**

Here is what I am watching for as signs that the markets believe that the Cyprus crisis is getting out of hand. The chart below shows the relative return of the ETF of Greek stocks (GREK) against large cap eurozone stocks (FEZ). The GREK/FEZ ratio has declined and it is testing a relative support zone. Should it break support, then it's time to get more cautious.

I use this ratio for two reasons. Cypriot banks are highly exposed to Greek debt. As well, the Greek stock market is the high beta "canary in the coalmine" of risk in the eurozone.

Looking at a similar ratio of the Athens Index to the Euro STOXX 50, it gives me further comfort that the market isn't overly concerned about the Cyprus situation. This ratio isn't even testing the relative support level yet:

So take a deep breath and relax. The headlines represent the usual European negotiation drama in a crisis, with one or both sides leaking stories of catastrophe should there be no agreement.

On the other hand, the message from the markets is that this crisis will be resolve in a relatively benign manner. Listen to the markets. Calm down.
