    a few more stabs at what is going on in gold and financials. Being Canadian, I
    have no fear of the “smoking man”–a private government operative lurking in the
    background trying to silence me. Let’s enter the elephant in the room for this
    discussion: John Paulson. [http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/john_paulson/index.html?inline=nyt-per](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/john_paulson/index.html?inline=nyt-per) For
    those that do not know who John Paulson is, he is the legendary hedge fund manager
    who made triple digit returns in 2008 by positioning himself to profit from the
    credit collapse that he anticipated well in advance. Now even CNBC (controlled
    by the US government), calls him the most watched investor above even Warren Buffet
    (lent Goldman Sachs during the crisis–also working with the government). Lets
    fast forward to 2009, where Mr.Paulson discloses a couple weeks ago that he has
    substantial stakes in Bank of America and Citigroup :[http://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idUSTRE57Q1C820090827](http://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idUSTRE57Q1C820090827).'

    himself– former Fed Chair Alan Greenspan to serve as an advisor to his fund. 
    It is obvious that after making himself one of the richest people in the world
    profiting from the armageddon last year, the government may have decided to lean
    on him to co-operate to help fix everything. You know how this works, its sort
    of like when the mob tells you that you need them for protection. After all, what
    better vote of faith to have the ultimate cynic buy a large stake in worthless
    Citigroup and tell everyone that it is “undervalued.” This helped to launch the
    most recent leg of the financial rally, the one that sent every worthless company
    flying up 50%-100% or more. Now just to complete the picture, you should know
    that John Paulson is a major owner of GLD (gold ETF), he is also a major owner
    of SKF (ultrashort financials). Would it be not unrealistic to believe that Mr.
    Paulson has recently sold large blocks of his financial holdings–helping account
    for the dramatic turnover in these names—- and has replaced them with additional
    holdings in GLD? This would leave him heavily long gold and short financials.
    If so, what is that Mr. Paulson knows? If he was smart enough to foresee the disaster
    in 2008 and even smarter to figure out how to best profit from it, how much wiser  would
    this financial wizard be now that he is (was?) a major owner of the largest banks
    in the country and likely privy to private government information? Or maybe he
    and Alan Greenspan just get together for idle cocktail conversations.

    they know that eventually they will have to pull back the curtain and reveal what
    is happening. Both the government and financiers like Paulson are aware that three
    things will likely happen when this information is revealed: 1) financials will
    fall 2) the US dollar will rise as it has become a carry trade currency that investors
    across the globe have used to speculate with 3) gold will rise temporarily, first
    allowing everyone to pile in as a bastion of safety prior to its sudden and unexplained
    collapse. Position yourself accordingly.'

    when trading gold: central banks actively manipulate the price–which Mr. Greenspan
    himself alluded to in the past. There is a distinct possibility that the breakout
    in GLD was engineered to allow Paulson, the US government, and others to liquidate
    to the excitable gold bugs. After all, mere rumors of bank failures  can get a
    gold bug calling up his broker to load up the gold positions, while reaching for
    the rifle and the canned food. Who better to sell to than a person that would
    sell everything they owned to buy more of the shiny stuff.  How do we track the
    actions of the central banks in the gold market? One has to look at the COT (Commitments
    of Traders) Report where we see that the central banks have a much smaller position
    that normal and have been selling/shorting over the last week. In contrast, institutional
    players are heavily long—nearly the longest they have been in a long time and
    have been increasing their exposure. Ditto for the small trader who is also heavily
    long the shiny stuff.  This means that everyone is pretty much “all in” leaving
    me wondering whether this leaves much room for a sustainable breakout. So what
    were our institutional holders—likely including Paulson and co—doing after this
    fantastic rise in the price of gold? What are they doing with their financial
    positions? Curiously when I looked at the money flows today in the Wall Street
    Journal, I saw the following :[http://online.wsj.com/mdc/public/page/2_3022-mflppg-moneyflow.html?mod=mdc_uss_mnyflo](http://online.wsj.com/mdc/public/page/2_3022-mflppg-moneyflow.html?mod=mdc_uss_mnyflo) Note
    that the top positions indicate heavy institutional selling into strength. What
    are the top positions? None other than GLD, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan. Coincidence?
    I think not!'

    financials.
