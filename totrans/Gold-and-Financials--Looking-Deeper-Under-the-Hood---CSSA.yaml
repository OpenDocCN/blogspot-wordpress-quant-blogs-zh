    a few more stabs at what is going on in gold and financials. Being Canadian, I
    have no fear of the “smoking man”–a private government operative lurking in the
    background trying to silence me. Let’s enter the elephant in the room for this
    discussion: John Paulson. [http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/john_paulson/index.html?inline=nyt-per](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/john_paulson/index.html?inline=nyt-per) For
    those that do not know who John Paulson is, he is the legendary hedge fund manager
    who made triple digit returns in 2008 by positioning himself to profit from the
    credit collapse that he anticipated well in advance. Now even CNBC (controlled
    by the US government), calls him the most watched investor above even Warren Buffet
    (lent Goldman Sachs during the crisis–also working with the government). Lets
    fast forward to 2009, where Mr.Paulson discloses a couple weeks ago that he has
    substantial stakes in Bank of America and Citigroup :[http://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idUSTRE57Q1C820090827](http://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idUSTRE57Q1C820090827).'

  zh: 作为一个狂热的X档案粉丝，我心中的阴谋论者禁不住想再次揣摩黄金和金融领域的动向。作为一名加拿大人，我并不害怕“烟雾人”——一个潜伏在背后试图让我保持沉默的政府私人代理人。让我们谈谈这次讨论中的大象在房间里：约翰·保尔森。[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/john_paulson/index.html?inline=nyt-per](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/john_paulson/index.html?inline=nyt-per)对于不了解约翰·保尔森的人来说，他是传奇的对冲基金经理，通过提前预测并从信贷崩溃中获利，于2008年赚得了三位数的回报。现在甚至连由美国政府控制的CNBC都称他是比沃伦·巴菲特还要受关注的投资者（在危机期间借给高盛，也与政府合作）。让我们快进到2009年，保尔森先生几周前披露他在美国银行和花旗银行拥有大量股份：[http://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idUSTRE57Q1C820090827](http://www.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idUSTRE57Q1C820090827)。
- en: Curiously Mr. Paulson has also commissioned none other than the bubble-builder
    himself– former Fed Chair Alan Greenspan to serve as an advisor to his fund. 
    It is obvious that after making himself one of the richest people in the world
    profiting from the armageddon last year, the government may have decided to lean
    on him to co-operate to help fix everything. You know how this works, its sort
    of like when the mob tells you that you need them for protection. After all, what
    better vote of faith to have the ultimate cynic buy a large stake in worthless
    Citigroup and tell everyone that it is “undervalued.” This helped to launch the
    most recent leg of the financial rally, the one that sent every worthless company
    flying up 50%-100% or more. Now just to complete the picture, you should know
    that John Paulson is a major owner of GLD (gold ETF), he is also a major owner
    of SKF (ultrashort financials). Would it be not unrealistic to believe that Mr.
    Paulson has recently sold large blocks of his financial holdings–helping account
    for the dramatic turnover in these names—- and has replaced them with additional
    holdings in GLD? This would leave him heavily long gold and short financials.
    If so, what is that Mr. Paulson knows? If he was smart enough to foresee the disaster
    in 2008 and even smarter to figure out how to best profit from it, how much wiser  would
    this financial wizard be now that he is (was?) a major owner of the largest banks
    in the country and likely privy to private government information? Or maybe he
    and Alan Greenspan just get together for idle cocktail conversations.

  zh: 有趣的是，保尔森还委托了泡沫制造者本人--前美联储主席阿兰·格林斯潘担任他基金的顾问。很明显，在从去年的末日中获利后把自己变成世界上最富有的人之后，政府可能已经决定依靠他合作以帮助解决一切问题。你知道这是怎么回事，有点像黑帮告诉你需要他们的保护。毕竟，有什么比最终的怀疑者购买无价的花旗集团股份并告诉所有人它被“低估”更好的信任呢。这有助于推动最近的金融反弹，这是让每家无价值的公司的股价飙升50%－100%甚至更多的那一次。现在，为了完成整个画面，你应该知道约翰·保尔森是GLD（黄金ETF）的主要股东，他也是SKF（超短期金融）的主要股东。相信保尔森先生最近出售了大笔金融股份并用额外的持有GLD来取代它们并不是不现实的吧？这将使他大幅做多黄金并做空金融。如果是这样的话，保尔森知道什么？如果他足够聪明预见到2008年的灾难，并更聪明地找出如何最好地从中获利，那么这位金融巫师现在（曾经是？）作为该国最大银行的主要股东并有可能知晓政府的私人信息，那么他会是多么聪明呢？或者也许他和阿兰·格林斯潘只是闲聊时的对富。
- en: 'I think that if the government knows that financials are in deep trouble, then
    they know that eventually they will have to pull back the curtain and reveal what
    is happening. Both the government and financiers like Paulson are aware that three
    things will likely happen when this information is revealed: 1) financials will
    fall 2) the US dollar will rise as it has become a carry trade currency that investors
    across the globe have used to speculate with 3) gold will rise temporarily, first
    allowing everyone to pile in as a bastion of safety prior to its sudden and unexplained
    collapse. Position yourself accordingly.'

  zh: 我认为政府知道金融情况很糟糕，他们也知道最终他们将不得不拉开幕布，揭示发生了什么。政府和像保尔森这样的金融家都知道当这些信息被揭示时很可能会发生三件事：1）金融领域将下跌2）美元将上涨，因为它已经成为全球投资者用来投机的carry
    trade货币3）黄金暂时上涨，首先让所有人进入作为一个安全堡垒的地位，然后突然和莫名其妙地崩溃。调整好你的立场。
- en: 'There is one important piece of information that is highly useful to consider
    when trading gold: central banks actively manipulate the price–which Mr. Greenspan
    himself alluded to in the past. There is a distinct possibility that the breakout
    in GLD was engineered to allow Paulson, the US government, and others to liquidate
    to the excitable gold bugs. After all, mere rumors of bank failures  can get a
    gold bug calling up his broker to load up the gold positions, while reaching for
    the rifle and the canned food. Who better to sell to than a person that would
    sell everything they owned to buy more of the shiny stuff.  How do we track the
    actions of the central banks in the gold market? One has to look at the COT (Commitments
    of Traders) Report where we see that the central banks have a much smaller position
    that normal and have been selling/shorting over the last week. In contrast, institutional
    players are heavily long—nearly the longest they have been in a long time and
    have been increasing their exposure. Ditto for the small trader who is also heavily
    long the shiny stuff.  This means that everyone is pretty much “all in” leaving
    me wondering whether this leaves much room for a sustainable breakout. So what
    were our institutional holders—likely including Paulson and co—doing after this
    fantastic rise in the price of gold? What are they doing with their financial
    positions? Curiously when I looked at the money flows today in the Wall Street
    Journal, I saw the following :[http://online.wsj.com/mdc/public/page/2_3022-mflppg-moneyflow.html?mod=mdc_uss_mnyflo](http://online.wsj.com/mdc/public/page/2_3022-mflppg-moneyflow.html?mod=mdc_uss_mnyflo) Note
    that the top positions indicate heavy institutional selling into strength. What
    are the top positions? None other than GLD, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan. Coincidence?
    I think not!'

  zh: 在交易黄金时，有一条重要的信息非常有用：央行积极操纵价格——这是格林斯潘先生过去曾暗示过的。有明显迹象表明，GLD的突破可能是精心策划的，允许保尔森（Paulson）、美国政府和其他人将持有的金卖给激动的黄金信徒。毕竟，银行倒闭的传言对黄金信徒来说，可能会让他们致电经纪人，增加黄金头寸，并拿起步枪和罐头食品。比谁更适合销售，能卖他们所有的东西来买更多闪闪发光的东西呢。那么，我们如何追踪央行在黄金市场上的行动呢？我们必须查看COT（交易承诺）报告，在报告中，我们会看到央行的头寸比通常要小得多，过去一周一直在抛售/做空。相比之下，机构投资者的多头头寸高达几乎是长期以来最高水平，并且一直在增加他们的持仓。小投资者也对这闪亮的东西也是看多的。这意味着每个人几乎都“全副武装”，这让我怀疑是否还有很多余地来实现可持续的突破。那么，在黄金价格上涨后，我们的机构持有者——很可能包括保尔森和其他人——在财务头寸上做了什么呢？他们对金融头寸做了什么？当我查看华尔街日报上的资金流向时，我惊讶地发现以下内容：[http://online.wsj.com/mdc/public/page/2_3022-mflppg-moneyflow.html?mod=mdc_uss_mnyflo](http://online.wsj.com/mdc/public/page/2_3022-mflppg-moneyflow.html?mod=mdc_uss_mnyflo)请注意，排在前面的头寸表明机构在市场强势时大举抛售。顶级头寸是什么？不是别的，是GLD、高盛和摩根大通。巧合？我认为不是！
