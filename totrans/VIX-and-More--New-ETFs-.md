# VIX and More: New ETFs?

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/02/new-etfs_4642.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/02/new-etfs_4642.html#0001-01-01)

So I'm thinking about a couple of new ETFs that are in the can't miss category:

1.  ***FadeTheOpenETF*** -- fades any opening gap of 1% or more, with a PSAR trailing stop

2.  ***ShortTheFedSpeechETF*** -- goes short the major indices (or at least the financials) 10 minutes before any Fed member speaks and doesn't close out the position until the markets have a session in the green

Perhaps in a couple of years, you can have a full ETF trading strategy menu, so that just before the open each day, you can absorb all the news and click on a couple of strategy boxes, then watch the ETFs do all the work for you.

Which obvious ETF winners am I missing?
