    still. As everyone knows, the smoke will rise, but not in a simple regular flow;
    the rising flow is unstable, begins to wobble, and then breaks out into a tangled
    mess -- turbulence. You don't need any outside cause or shock to the rising smoke
    to make it happen.

    booms and busts, and yet economists seem quite hesitant to see such fluctuations
    as the result of similar natural instability. In recent decades, at least, they
    seem to have greatly preferred the idea that fluctuations around average growth
    must be caused by "shocks" to the economy of some kind. Noah Smith recently gave

    new stuff than normal. Fewer new inventions this year mean fewer new inventions
    next year, too. Anticipating this, companies invest less, and they also cut workers'
    wages. When wages go down, workers decide to take a vacation instead of work.
    Voila -- a recession!

    the theory I just described *is* a real macroeconomic theory. It [came out](http://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/prescott/papers/timetobuild.pdf)
    in 1982, and its name is the Real Business Cycle model. In 2004, its creators,
    Edward Prescott and Finn Kydland, won a Nobel Prize for their work. The theory
    inspired a generation of researchers, and became the dominant theory in certain
    places, such as the University of Minnesota.

    short, doesn’t deserve its moniker. Just as the Holy Roman Empire was none of
    the above, RBC theory doesn’t seem to have much to do with business or cycles,
    and for that matter doesn’t sound particularly real. Most people think that recessions
    are caused by asset-price crashes, by disturbances in the financial sector, or
    by Federal Reserve tightening of the money supply.

    isn't important. Asset prices crash because people see a recession coming ahead
    of time and act accordingly. And the Fed, according to Prescott in a recent [interview](http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2014/01/the-econ-nobel-prize-is-really-weird.html),
    has no more effect on the economy than a rain dance has on rain. In fact, RBC
    is really sort of a giant null hypothesis -- a claim that the phenomenon known
    as the business cycle is just an illusion, and that recessions are the normal,
    smooth functioning of an efficient economy.

    in fact, that theories of this basic class, if examined more closely, actually
    predict the existence of inherent instabilities in economies. Specifically, if
    you relax even slightly some of the heroic assumptions usually employed in such
    theories -- regarding agents' perfect rational foresight, or the ability of firms
    to adjust their output instantaneously to changing economic conditions -- then
    these models become unstable, so that large recessions will happen even without
    any external shocks, simply because of coordination failures within the economy.

    and then suddenly, without warning, falls into a hole. Unemployment soars until
    somehow, sooner or later, growth resumes. Every economy on the planet has experienced
    these painful, mysterious and apparently unavoidable slumps.

    In this view, you get a recession when some big thing like an oil crisis whacks
    the economy, causing a corresponding reaction. Conservative economists assume
    individuals and businesses will react in the best and most rational possible way,
    creating an optimal economic response, so the government shouldn't get involved.
    Others take the less extreme view that governments and central banks, acting wisely,
    can intervene to help an economy recover.

    make it possible for even tiny shocks to have big consequences, much as a spark
    in a parched forest can trigger a vast fire. A small downturn for an auto manufacturer
    might hurt its suppliers, undermining their ability to supply other auto makers
    and creating a growing cascade of distress. The cause is less the shock and more
    the links that amplify it.

    the result of big shocks, or of small shocks with amplification. They ignore a

    any of a number of dimensions -- firms taking a little time to adjust their production
    to new levels, for example, rather than doing so instantaneously -- you always
    end up with an inherently unstable economy. The conclusion is pretty much the
    opposite of what the Real Business Cycle theory's creators originally intended.
    They wanted to defend the notion that markets work perfectly, not to entertain
    the possibility that recessions might reflect an inability of markets to coordinate
    supply and demand. Their own model actually destroys that hope.

    years, many economists have argued that their assumptions of perfect rationality,
    self-interest and equilibrium are merely convenient elements in valuable thought
    experiments; they learn about the real world despite the manifestly false assumptions.
    That position now looks completely indefensible. It looks more as if Big Shock
    theorists are worried that relaxing their assumptions will lead to some very different
    and very inconvenient conclusions.
