    on Automated Market Makers (AMMs) and was surprised to hear Gordan Grant from
    Genesis mention [squeeths](https://www.opyn.co/) as a way to hedge their AMM liquidity
    provider (LP) positions. Genesis is a standard, KYC/AML, TradFi company and so
    has easy access to liquid option markets on Deribit. The only reason to buy or
    sell squeeths would be if you want option exposure but are constrained to the
    blockchain. The reason priced-squared contracts are not traded over-the-counter
    on Wall Street is the same as why there is no peanut butter flavored toothpaste:
    no one wants it.'

    way to see how this product works is via [this December 2021 post](https://medium.com/opyn/hedging-uniswap-v3-with-squeeth-bcaf1750ea11)
    by Joseph Clarke. The application here is hedging a Uniswap LP position. Below
    is a chart of the best-case scenario for the squeeth. Here we see the LP’s impermanent
    loss (IL) as a sad frowning red curve, always below zero. The squeeth is the happy
    yellow curve that nets the LP’s profit to the flat green line.

    you can see how these are calculated, and you can compare these formulas to the
    text, as Clark does a good job of explaining how to derive these values.

    which shows a complete immunization of the pnl variability of the naked Uniswap
    IL in the second column from the left (‘Uniswap pnl’).

    making markets (*aka* providing liquidity) in an option-like product, you should
    not hedge your book by buying or selling options. Hedging an option with an option
    is the tactic of a derivatives wholesaler; an options market maker delta-hedges
    their book.

    involve cases where customers are ignorant of market protocols and need costly
    education. For example, when I worked at KeyBank, a regional bank in Cleveland,
    we would often take FX or interest rate swap orders from local companies and immediately
    offload them onto a big investment bank in New York. We would charge a spread
    for the business, and these are the types of ‘traders’ who brag about making money
    every day as if they were market wizards. Goldman Sachs does not have the resources
    to establish relationships with these little companies, so this makes sense.

    what they do, and who can blame them, given the common sales pitch centered around
    “eliminating the middleman.” While it might seem obvious to fire these expensive
    brokers and outsource their services to an Indian customer service team, the customers
    needing $10MM of Euros in two months would then realize their transaction is much
    simpler than it appears and shop around. The small bank would either lose the
    business or have to charge a lower fee. Thus, overpaid regional bank trader/brokers
    are an equilibrium.

    it would not make sense because it implies more delta hedging than if you didn’t
    buy a squeeth. If you are short gamma, as Uniswap LPs are, your expected cost
    is the same whether you hedge or not (see my earlier post on that [here](https://efalken.substack.com/p/how-and-why-to-measure-liquidity?s=w)).
    However, you *should* hedge because it will reduce your risk, which will lower
    your capital requirement. Hedging your delta is a straightforward problem; once
    you have coded it up, it won’t cut into your time watching the latest cat videos
    on Tik-Tok.

- en: The squeeth delta at inception is 10.59 in this example, while the LP’s delta
    is only 1.45\. Thus, the amount of delta trading needed to initiate the squeeth
    will probably be greater than the amount of delta trading needed throughout the
    life of your LP position. Further, it does not reduce your required dynamic delta
    hedging, in that as the price moves the squeeth’s delta will change just as the
    LP position does, in the same direction. This is a large addition to fees.

- en: Another issue is that the additional amount of capital needed to buy the squeeth
    would almost triple that needed for the Uniswap LP position alone. If you add
    the capital needed for the initial short delta position, you are probably using
    five times more capital compared to your initial Uniswap LP position.

    the squeeth pnl ignores its cost. The happy curves apply to a bizarro world where
    one is trying to minimize a loss as opposed to maximizing a return. This violates
    what game theorists call the [participation constraint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participation_constraint_(mechanism_design)):
    a sustainable game not only has to assume players will play their best strategy
    within the game, the best payoff must be greater than zero or they will not play
    at all. As the squeeth seller requires at least twice as much capital as the squeeth
    buyer, and the squeeth buyer requires multiple more capital than the LP, the fees
    charged by the squeeth seller will be more than that of the LP in an efficient
    market. A hedged position that loses money is best avoided.'

- en: The only case where a squeeth helps would be cases of ‘jump risk,’ when markets
    move so quickly that you are not able to delta hedge. These extreme events are
    costly and rare. Just remember that low probability options, whether bets in sportsbooks,
    options, or lottery tickets, have the worst expected returns for buyers. These
    are, literally, lottery tickets, and lotteries make a lot of money for the seller,
    which is why governments like to monopolize them. The squeeth seller, realizing
    this, will charge more for the same amount of vega one sees in regular option
    markets.

    every day using the updated implied volatility. They call this method of imputing
    a time decay a normalization factor. For standard options with explicit maturities,
    the theta decay shows up in the square root of time term.
  prefs: []

- en: In a standard option or variance swap, your initial implied volatility is the
    cut-off where the buyer makes money if the actual volatility is higher than the
    implied volatility, and the seller makes money if it is lower. In contrast, the
    squeeth’s method of resetting the option daily to generate theta means that after
    the first day, the actual volatility tells you nothing about whether the buyer
    or seller is making money. This makes a squeeth held longer than a day a position
    on gamma, but neutral on volatility. Few people have an intuition for this kind
    of trade, and few would desire it if they understood it.

- en: If you are an LP thinking about hedging your risk, stick to delta hedging. It’s
    easy to do, and if you do it twice a day, given the law of Large Numbers, it will
    hedge your position as well as an explicit option over a couple of months. Squeeths
    generate a several-fold increase in capital and delta hedging, not to mention
    the costs implicit in the bid-ask spread of illiquid options, as well as the credit
    and operational risk lurking in these protocols. It’s a train wreck of a product.
