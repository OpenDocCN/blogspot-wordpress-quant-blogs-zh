    was not going to continue indefinitely, but last week’s correction was rather
    dramatic, as the [MOS chart](http://stockcharts.com/charts/gallery.html?mos) shows.  Compounding
    an already difficult week, [Perini (PCR)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=pcr),
    whose addition to the portfolio caused me to [raise an eyebrow at last week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/11/portfolio-a1-increases-lead-over-spx-as.html),
    did nothing to assuage my concerns, losing 7.5% in the first week.

    16, 2007 inception, still comfortably ahead of the 0.2% gain in the benchmark
    S&P 500 index.  As is evident from the bottom two graphics, this enhanced performance
    has come with considerably more risk than the SPX in the form of a much higher
    variability of returns.  The next iteration of this portfolio (to be launched
    at the beginning of 2008), will aim to minimize risk somewhat more than the current
    portfolio, while continuing to seek out stocks like Mosaic that can supercharge
    returns.  The ride will no doubt be just as interesting – and hopefully more profitable
    and instructive.
