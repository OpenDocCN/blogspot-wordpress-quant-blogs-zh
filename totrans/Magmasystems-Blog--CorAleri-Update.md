# Magmasystems Blog: CorAleri Update

> 来源：[http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2009/05/coraleri-update.html#0001-01-01](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2009/05/coraleri-update.html#0001-01-01)

We met with the good folks from

CorAleri

yesterday in order to get an update on their post-merger

roadmap

. Some of the presentation was under

NDA

, but all in all, things seem to be falling in a fairly predictable path.

Here are the highlights:

1) Merger going well. The

dev

teams from New Jersey and California have drank the mutual

KoolAid

. Nice to see Jon and Bob sitting next to each other, doing the photo-op. Seriously, its great to see two of the nicest companies join forces.

2)

CCL

with Splash is the new language.

3) Work is going on towards a new Eclipse-based

IDE

.

4) There will be a new engine that incorporates the best of both engines.

Aleri

is very committed to keeping low latency a big priority.

5) Support for debugging and profiling.

6) Most likely will use the

Aleri

adapters.

7) The Coral8 engine can now use

Aleri's LiveOLAP

, and the

Aleri

engine can now use the Coral8 Portal.

Some of this was announced

publicly

already by

CorAleri

, some of these are things that were requested by customers. Basically, no surprises ... just a clear

roadmap

for consolidation and evolution.
