    on agile requirements discovery.  Chapter 4 is a great read on expressing desirements
    with user stories, specifically the template most of us use today around Who,
    What Why (As a <role>…), and the unfortunately sometimes forgotten INVEST mnemonic. 
    Ubiquitous language is again mentioned on page 40 🙂  Chapter 7 title says it all
    – Automating confirmation with acceptance tests 🙂 backed up with figure 7.1 (page
    98)  Appropriate mention of DSL on page 104, around translating the scenario into
    an acceptance test – cut down on the parse/translate cycle of pain! Context-specification
    testing (page 116).  Chapter 8 should offer a lot to readers, as its often a hotly
    debated subject in the trenches – Addressing non-functional requirements (NFRs). 
    Page 127 offer the advice of translating NFRs into restrictions on scenarios –
    the SMART principle.  Page 128 should be read for all those first class tech stories
    that software engineer initially want to write 😉  Page 150 ends with a good view
    of what testers and programmer’s should do in an executable specification world.
