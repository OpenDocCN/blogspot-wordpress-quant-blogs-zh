    to [Efficient-market hypothesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis).
    For a good summary of seasonality, have a look at [Capitalizing On Seasonal Effects](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/05/seasonaltrends.asp#axzz1hxtr1mbl)
    article at Investopedia. Another interesting discussion was started by Douglas
    R Terry in his post [Efficient Market Hypothesis and Seasonality](http://www.alhambrapartners.com/2011/12/11/efficient-market-hypothesis-and-apple-seasonality/)
    that goes into detail analysis how these two ideas can co-exist.
