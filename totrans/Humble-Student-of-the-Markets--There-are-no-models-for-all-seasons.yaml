    I believed that quantitative investing was easy. I could build quantitative models,
    plug them in and they could run on autopilot. As we saw with the recent mortgage
    debacle, models don’t work in all environments and analysts need to continually
    question the assumptions behind the models.

    [will occur in the first half of 2009](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2008/10/does-market-bottom-in-1q2q-2009.html)).
    For the purposes of this discussion, the timing is not relevant. Whenever the
    recovery happens we will see a [Phoenix effect](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2008/05/waiting-for-ride-on-phoenix.html)
    that will see the low-priced shares of near bankrupt companies spurt to eye-popping
    levels.

    such a turnaround period. Most mainstream quant models tend to buy stocks of companies
    with positive cash flows, positive earnings momentum, positive estimate revisions
    and good potential for positive earning surprise, cheap valuations, good GARP
    characteristics and so on. Phoenix stocks have terrible balance sheets and highly
    negative earnings (how does a P/E of -5 strike you?) What's more, low stock price
    or low trading volume that get screened out because of investability criteria.
    As a result, most multifactor quant models will simply not buy Phoenix stocks.

    quantitative equity stock selection models fail. I [wrote](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2008/05/waiting-for-ride-on-phoenix.html)
    that Jeff deGraaf reported in late 2003 that the return spread between the lowest
    and highest decile of the stock price factor was about 70% - an astounding return.
    If your multifactor stock selection model is as I have described, then be prepared
    for a year or so of bad relative performance.

    success in quantitative investing is to have an understanding of the macro issues.
    I wrote in a recent post that we are facing a [fork in the road between inflation
    and deflation](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2008/10/barbell-portfolio-for-fork-in-road.html)
    and the result was highly dependent on policy and market response. Given these
    hugely disparate outcomes it would be surprising that the same quant model would
    behave the same way in both environments.'

    sheets and low financial leverage tend to outperform. When prices are falling,
    the ability to maintain margins would depend more on the power of a brand and
    the product and service a company is selling. Even with the consumer staple sector,
    there are differences. [Nielsen](http://www.nielsen.com/media/2008/pr_080604a.html)
    recently put out a study showing consumer product categories were more recession
    resistant than others (e.g. beer is but tobacco is not).

    rising inflationary expectations as debt becomes a cheap source of capital. Hard
    assets and commodity producers are also winners in inflationary eras as they can
    maintain or even raise their margins in the face of rising prices. Middlemen lose.
    When we went through the recent bout with inflation, we heard numerous stories
    from the likes of Starbucks and Hershey’s about the cost of their inputs (milk,
    cocoa, etc.) squeezing their margins. Yet it is precisely these companies that
    would tend to stand up better in a deflationary period because of the strength
    of their brands.
