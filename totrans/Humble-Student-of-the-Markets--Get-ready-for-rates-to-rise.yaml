    ***Manufacturers in many Districts conveyed that they were passing through higher
    input costs to customers or planned to do so in the near future***. Homebuilders
    in the Cleveland and Atlanta Districts noted rising material costs, but acknowledged
    little ability to pass through the costs to buyers. Retailers in some Districts
    mentioned they had implemented price increases or were anticipating such action
    in the next few months. There is little evidence of wage pressures across Districts.
    Wages remained steady in the Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Kansas City, and
    Dallas Districts, while moderate wage pressures were reported in the Chicago,
    Minneapolis and San Francisco Districts. Philadelphia, Dallas, and San Francisco
    noted that most wage increases were for workers with specialized skills.

    that wages pressures was relatively weak. If we continue to get reports like this
    and oil prices back off so that they don't create a recession risk, then QE3 is
    likely off the table in 2H.

- en: Investors should view June 30th, 2011 not as political historians view November
    11th, 1918 (Armistice Day – a day of reconciliation and healing) but more like
    June 6th, 1944 (D-Day – a day fraught with hope for victory, but fueled with immediate
    uncertainty and fear as to what would happen in the short term). Bond yields and
    stock prices are resting on an artificial foundation of QE II credit that may
    or may not lead to a successful private market handoff and stability in currency
    and financial markets. 15% gratuities may lie ahead, but more than likely there
    is a negative two-bit or even eight-bit tip lying on the investment table. Like
    I did 45 years ago, PIMCO’s not sticking around to see the waitress’s reaction.
