    R.  I posted a lot about [rCharts](http://rcharts.io/site), but it is not the
    only way.  In my mind there are three types of glue to link R to SVG/HTML/Javascript:'

    This is the process employed by [rCharts](http://rcharts.io/site), [clickme](http://rclickme.com/),[d3network](http://christophergandrud.github.io/d3Network/),
    [googleVis](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/googleVis/index.html), [gigvis](https://github.com/rstudio/gigvis),
    and [tabplotd3](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tabplotd3/index.html).

    from Javascript. We see this with the new and improved [gridSVG](http://sjp.co.nz/projects/gridsvg/)
    and the predecessor [SVGAnnotation](http://www.omegahat.org/SVGAnnotation/SVGAnnotationPaper/SVGAnnotationPaper.html#bib:SVGAnnotation).

    through [shiny](http://rstudio.com/shiny), [Rook](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rook/index.html),
    or some other web server type interface.

    I want both.

- en: We R users are very spoiled by the ggplot2 and lattice engines that rival or
    beat the plotting libraries of any language.  Wouldn’t it be nice to have all
    the power of these engines to create interactive graphs?  Well, [Paul Murrell](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~paul/),
    the author of grid (platform of ggplot2 and lattice), wrote [gridSVG](http://sjp.co.nz/projects/gridsvg/)
    to do just that.  Over the last couple of years, [Simon Potter](http://sjp.co.nz/projects/gridsvg/)
    under the guidance of Murrell has refined gridSVG for his honours project.  It
    is now a full-featured robust package capable of sending even your most complicated
    ggplot2 and lattice masterpieces to SVG.   gridSVG can do amazing things on his
    own, but I, of course, wanted to combine gridSVG with [d3](http://d3js.org).

    below to see a walkthrough applying a little gridSVG glue to ggplot2 and d3\.

    all the folks along the way that have made this possible.
