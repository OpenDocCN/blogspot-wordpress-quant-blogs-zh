- en: The kelly optimal allocation can be extended to strategies as was alluded to
    in the previous post on non-parametric statistics .  In this case, we are using
    the conventional pearson covariance to demonstrate that the allocation model is
    useful for strategy allocation.  The current lookback for the model inputs are
    again 3-years or 756 days. In this case the allocation is made between buy and
    hold the S&P500 index and the use of an RSI2 50/50 system on the same index. The
    portfolio can go long or short any of the model components. In this case the inclusion
    of buy and hold is important because if the RSI strategy is not effective than
    we simply hold the market and thus lower our chances of under-performing the same
    benchmark (ie buy and hold). This is a subtle point, because it is certainly possible
    that an effective strategy for a given market does not exist, and thus allocating
    amongst an inferior set of strategies will substantially increase the chance of
    under-performing which in turn for many managers DOES impact AUM.  As you can
    see the performance of the allocation model is quite consistent and beats buy
    and hold nearly every year.  A more complex allocation model will be introduced
    later this week.
