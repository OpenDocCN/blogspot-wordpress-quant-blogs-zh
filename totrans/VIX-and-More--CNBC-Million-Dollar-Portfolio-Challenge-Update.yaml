    am happy to report that as of last night, I am now in the top 1% in the [CNBC
    Million Dollar Portfolio Challenge](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/CNBC%20Million%20Dollar%20Portfolio%20Challenge)
    at #4577 out of what appears to be about a half million participants.'

    to call market tops a little early, I thought I'd share the news today in the
    event my position starts to 'correct' a little.

- en: Briefly, energy and copper stocks have helped propel me to my current standing
    and I am heavily weighted in oil, gas and uranium at the moment. In most stock
    contests, it pays to take ridiculous risks in hopes of lucking into a triple digit
    return. I have not yet succumbed to that temptation. Instead, making largely incremental
    gains here and there, I am up 27%. As long as I continue to outperform the market
    and move up the leader board, I will not be putting all my chips on my favorite
    number -- until perhaps the last 2-3 weeks of the competition.

    one of my favorite trumpet players. I figured that if I were going to toot my
    own horn, I should also acknowledge the work of a true master, who, sadly, had
    so little time to dazzle us with his talent.

    the top ten contestants are already sitting on 100% gains, so I may have to rethink
    my strategy sooner rather than later...'
