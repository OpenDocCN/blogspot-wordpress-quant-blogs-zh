- en: As 2010 has come to an end, I would like to review the record of the [Inflation-Deflation
    Timer Model](http://www.qwestfunds.com/publications/newsletters_pdf/newsletter_november_2009.pdf)
    for the year. The chart below shows the cumulative returns of different asset
    classes, with December 31, 2009 indexed at 100\. The red line represents commodity
    returns, as measured by the Reuters/Jeffries CRB Index, the black line equities,
    the S&P/TSX 60, and the blue line the US long Treasury bond. The shaded areas
    are the signals of the Inflation-Deflation Timer Model, as disseminated in previous
    *[Trend Watch](http://www.qwestfunds.com/publications/password/trend_watch.html)*
    publications.

- en: The Model's record in 2010 wasn't perfect but it wasn't bad either. For all
    of 2010, it correctly remained long risky assets, either in the form of equities
    or the higher beta commodities, and those assets had positive returns for 2010\.
    The grey areas were “inflation” signal periods, which would have moved the model
    portfolio into commodities, and the white areas were “neutral” signal periods,
    which would have moved the model portfolio into equities. The green shaded area
    represented a period when the Inflation-Deflation Timer Model gave off an “inflation”
    signal, in which the Model would have normally bought commodities.

- en: '**Model override turned out to be incorrect** However, I overrode that signal
    and stayed in “neutral” because of the anomalous condition of rising commodity
    prices and falling bond yields. It wasn’t until mid-November when bond yields
    began to rise again that we moved to an “inflation” reading. As it turned out,
    our model override was incorrect as the Model correctly forecast the outperformance
    of commodities relative to equities'

- en: In retrospect, I would still have made the decision to override the Model for
    risk control reasons as commodity and bond markets were giving highly divergent
    market signals of inflation expectations. At that point, my level of confidence
    in the model was relatively low. In the words of
