## Agile influences Behavior Change

There is often debate around what Extreme Programming ([XP](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules.html)) / agile practices work, and what doesn’t – hotly debate are often [pair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) programming and [test-driven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) development.  What is often missed is that agile has an underpinning, which is the drive for behaviour [changes](https://www.scrumalliance.org/community/articles/2016/may/agile-is-about-a-change-in-behavior-first) to deliver improvements (quality) in the deliver of software.  This may seem obvious, but its worth calling out explicitly – [Connection](https://www.agileconnection.com/article/six-behaviors-consider-agile-team) and [here](https://www.raconteur.net/business/how-to-manage-agile).

Whichever agile techniques you find that work for you and the team, just remember, the need for behaviour change is an ongoing process to drive [quality](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8946/1e67a61cf2ecda279557358220f3e757d975.pdf) improvements, its not that adoption of any particular agile technique itself will improve quality.
