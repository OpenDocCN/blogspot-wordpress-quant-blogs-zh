    then value investing is inherently difficult. It means doing things will make
    you truly queasy. What’s more, classic value investors tend to be early and will
    suffer early losses before their investments turn profits.

    had all these tools and could look back at history to see how different techniques
    performed in past markets. What's more, it was highly risk controlled. Over time,
    the barriers to entry to using these techniques came down and it became too easy
    to run these strategies. In August 2007, virtually all quants suffered large losses.
    They were in a crowded trade and someone ran for the exit (see

    Find a manager like Ken Heebner, who was prescient about the fall of housing and
    thought that the housing could collapse by 50% in selected markets. Another is
    Eric Sprott in Canada, who was early to jump on the commodity bandwagon. I mention
    them to show examples of portfolio managers who display a top-down, analytical
    but non-quantitative systematic style of investing (and not to endorse either
    Heebner or Sprott).'
