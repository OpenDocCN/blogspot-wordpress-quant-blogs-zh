- en: Once again I am happy to be able to pinch hit for Steve Sears and his *The Striking
    Price* column at [Barron’s](http://online.barrons.com/). In [How to Trade Options
    Around Volatile Events](http://online.barrons.com/article/SB50001424053111904184504577518802209654274.html?mod=BOL_hpp_highlight_bottom),
    I expand on some of the thinking that I first laid out in 2008 in [A Conceptual
    Framework for Volatility Events](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/06/1000th-post.html).
    Specifically, I discuss some of the trading opportunities associated with [event
    volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/event%20volatility) and
    tie that in to [FOMC](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/FOMC) meetings,
    the [European sovereign debt crisis](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/European%20sovereign%20debt%20crisis)
    and similar sources of volatility.

    that loom in the next six months, the subject of how to trade options around volatile
    events deserves much more discussion – and I will do what I can to fill that gap
    in the weeks and months ahead.
