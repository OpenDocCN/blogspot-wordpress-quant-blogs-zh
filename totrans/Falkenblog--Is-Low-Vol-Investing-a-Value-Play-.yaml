    these papers devolve into convoluted arguments certain to rationalize the CAPM

    premium is primarily just a return to negative skew, which investors dislike and
    thus demand a premium.'

    line of reasoning rather unserious, as when Nassim Taleb pals around with Danny
    Kahneman, one arguing that we are primarily prefer positive skew (Kahneman), the
    other negative skew (Taleb), and they happily consider themselves brothers in
    arms. It's like anarchists and fascists united against the status quo, which would
    excusable if they were not also happily convinced they are more alike than different.

    why equities are generally thought to have higher returns than corporate bonds,
    even though clearly bonds have much greater negative skew than equities. And just

    care about variance AND skew, the maximum skew premium is a fraction of the 'variance
    premium', about one-fifth as large. This is because investors still must be globally
    risk averse, and since skew and variance are positively correlated, there are
    limits on how large the skew aversion can be relative to the variance aversion.

- en: Scherer notes that if you construct a minimum variance portfolio a certain way,
    and regress it against the 3 Fama-French factors (market, size, and value), as
    well as long-short portfolios formed on betas and residual variance, much of the
    MVP's performance is 'explained'. Now, given MVPs load up on low beta and low
    residual risk stocks, it's obvious that a long-short portfolio formed on CAPM
    betas and residual variances would explain the MVP return relative to the broader
    index, but that's really not interesting. It's a bit like saying the book/market
    effect explains the price/earnings effect.

    He notes that the return premium to value and the market is about 4% for both.
    As the market beta on his MVP portfolio is about 0.75, and his beta on value is
    about 0.25, it seems like a swap of market exposure for value exposure.

    a loading on itself.

    it was a 'value fund', had no explanatory power. The value risk factor is really
    just the value anomaly rebranded as a risk factor, because it isn't obviously
    'risky' in any sense. Originally it was thought value was related to financial
    distress, but then when we look at distress directly, such as using agency ratings
    or metrics of default based on income statements and balance sheets, distressed
    firms actually have lower-than-average returns. So I'm skeptical value is anything
    but a characteristic-based anomaly, not a 'risk factor'.

    created, I do not see a consistent value loading. Looking at the MVP, which I
    have data from 1998 to 2011, it estimates value beta of 0.34 using monthly data.
    Using daily data from July 2000 through July 2011, the value beta is 0.24\. These
    are around what Shah gets. Yet it floats around like an incidental symptom, not
    something fundamental. Here's the data for my MVP and Beta 0.5 portfolios using

    and little technology. True. But I've never seen someone argue that various industries
    have higher risk than others. Looking at industry relative returns, one three-year
    period over the prior, there is no pattern. That is, past winners do not repeat
    consistently, as they would if there were an industry risk premium. So, to say
    this is picking up the 'utility' risk premium, and avoiding the 'tech' insurance
    premium, does not make sense. Of course, the higher-weighted utility industry
    has much lower volatility than the lower weighted tech industry, and so if there
    was a risk story here, it would take some special pleading.

    low volatility investors. As long as people generally keep doing what they have
    done, the opportunity remains to simply improve one's index returns by focusing
    on the low volatility subset of stocks, lowering volatility and increasing the
    return. It's the easiest, large-scale way to better institutional returns since
    the invention of the index fund.
