- en: The [130/30 funds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/130-30_fund) were getting lots
    of attention a few years ago. The [130/30 fund](http://mutualfunds.about.com/od/typesoffunds/a/130_30_funds.htm)
    is a long/short portfolio that for each $100 dollars invested allocates $130 dollars
    to longs and $30 dollars to shorts. From portfolio construction perspective this
    simple idea is no so simple to implement.

    risk and return increase. At the lower risk, the optimizer wants to allocate 150%
    to longs and 50% to shorts, and at the higher risk the optimizer wants to allocate
    300% to longs and 200% to shorts.

    the efficient frontier to have 130% allocation to longs and 30% allocation to
    shorts. One solution to this problem was mentioned in [Asset Allocation and Risk
    Assessment with Gross Exposure Constraints for Vast Portfolios by J. Fan, Zhang

    there is sufficient volatility in the covariance matrix and optimizer uses additional
    leverage to generate optimal portfolios. To demonstrate this point, let’s imagine
    we want to construct 200/100 portfolio : 200% allocation to longs and 100% allocation
    to shorts. The only change required to create a new efficient frontier is to substitute
    1.6 constraint above with 3 ( 3 = 200% allocation to longs plus 100% allocation

    all the leverage at the lower risk region because optimal portfolios exist at
    the lower leverage levels. If we look at the ![x_{long}, x_{short}](img/80b284f1707915266fcb4649ed7ceaa8.png)
    at the lower risk region, they are not mutually exclusive, both ![x_{long}, x_{short}](img/80b284f1707915266fcb4649ed7ceaa8.png)

    library implements binary variables internally. The quadratic solver from [quadprog](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/quadprog/index.html)
    library does not handle binary variables. To add binary variables to quadratic
    solver I adapted binary branch and bound algorithm from [Matlab function for solving
