    10-15 minutes before the bell each day. I’ve been publishing them for nearly 4
    months now and to this point I believe there has only been one instance where
    the “probable” signal was switched based on that night’s research.

    to fight out of an 8% drawdown. It did manage to do so and it finished 2009 at
    a new high. The total reinvested (hypothetical – not including commissions/dividends/interest
    on cash) return for 2009 was 36.27%. The Quantifiable Edges Subscriber Letter
    began publishing on 2/25/2008 so that is as far back as Aggregator values go.
    Total returns for the partial (10+ months) year of 2008 was 60.20%. Therefore
    the total compounded profits since inception have been 118.31%.
