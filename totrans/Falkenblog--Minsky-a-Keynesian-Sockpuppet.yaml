    along. To the extent Minsky believed markets were endogenously unstable, inevitably
    generating financial crises, I think this is a profound truth about capitalist
    systems. But that's a rather general point. It does not identify the mechanism,
    it just says don't think business cycles and panics are history, because success
    breeds overconfidence, too much leverage, and eventual collapse.

- en: I was Minsky's TA while a senior at Washington University in St.Louis in 1987,
    and took a couple of his advanced classes, which regardless of the official name,
    were all just classes in Minskyism. He was a maverick, but perhaps a bit too much,
    being a little too dismissive of others, as he hated the traditional Samuelson/Solow
    Keynesians as much as the Friedmanite Monetarists. He always thought a market
    collapse was just around the corner. The S&P was 250 when I took his course, it
    went to 1500 in 2007 and then back to 735 in 2009\. Does that prove he was right
    all along?

    get an equilibrium, and the essence of his economics was macro, and macro had
    a necessary time dimension. With time, you get uncertainty, Keynesian uncertainty,
    the kind that cannot be measured. And with this kind of environment, it does not
    take long for people to become overconfident, and move from standard finance (paying
    principle and interest with cash flow), to levered finance (paying only interest
    with cash flow), to ponzi finance (paying only with increases in collateral value).
    The latter is a bubble, and when it breaks, it can cause collateral damage via
    The Multiplier leading to a Great Depression. [I remember when he got all worked
    up by reading someone saying his 'Ponzi' finance term was an Italian smear. The
    kind of things academics fight about...].

- en: 'The problem, however, is that his top-down theory is rejected by the data.
    Aggregate leverage ratios do not closely correspond to business cycles. If Minsky
    took microeconomics more seriously he could have made his theory more relevant,
    by noting that crises tend to occur in specific subsets in the economy: in 1990,
    hotels and Commercial real estate, in 2001, high tech, in 2008, mortgages. The
    mistake is not one made in aggregate, but in different sectors each recession.
    By noting these areas, but not the aggregate economy, had too much leverage, and
    depended on expected future increases in collateral value, he might have been
    more successful proselytizing his colleagues. But he was a traditional Keynesian,
    who liked to look at aggregate equations, like Profits=Investment + Deficits +
    Net Imports.'

  zh: 然而，问题在于，他的自上而下的理论被数据所拒绝。总杠杆率与商业周期并不密切对应。如果明斯基更认真地学习微观经济学，他本可以让自己的理论更有相关性，指出危机往往发生在经济的特定子集中：1990年，酒店和商业房地产，2001年，高科技，2008年，抵押贷款。错误不在于总体上，而在于每次经济衰退中不同的领域。通过指出这些领域，而不是总体经济，存在过多的杠杆，并依赖于对抵押品价值未来增长的预期，他可能更成功地说服同事。但他是一个传统的凯恩斯主义者，喜欢看总体方程式，比如利润=投资+赤字+净进口。

- en: 'of his undergraduate macro based on the General Theory, that if we only go
    back to the days when Nixon famously said ''we are all Keynesians now'', we would
    have more faith in government top-down solutions. That was when Federal spending
    was 30% of GDP. Now it''s 40%. Economists did not abandon Keynesianism because
    they are capitalist dupes, rather, it was inconsistent, generated poor models
    of economic growth, and it neglected the micro economic factors that make all
    the difference between a North Korea and South Korea: free markets, property rights,
    decentralized incentives. A Keynesian thought he could steer the economy via two
    controls, the budget deficit and the Fed Funds rate, and indeed in the short run
    these are very powerful tools, but in the longer run, rather unimportant.'

  zh: 他的本科宏观课程是基于《通论》，如果我们只回到尼克松著名地说过的“现在我们都是凯恩斯主义者”的日子，我们会更加信任政府的自上而下的解决方案。那时联邦支出占国内生产总值的30%。现在是40%。经济学家并没有因为他们是资本主义者的傀儡而放弃凯恩斯主义，相反，它是不一致的，制造了经济增长的贫乏模型，并且忽略了使朝鲜和韩国之间存在明显差异的微观经济因素：自由市场，产权，分散的激励。一个凯恩斯主义者认为他可以通过两个控制因素来引导经济，即预算赤字和联邦基金利率，确实在短期内这些是非常有力的工具，但在长期内，它们相当不重要。
