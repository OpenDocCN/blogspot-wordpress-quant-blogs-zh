    traders typically suffer a latency of at least 10ms.  For example, Interactive
    Brokers does not yet provide collocation facilities for its customers, so the
    best we can do is to place our trading servers on the internet backbone close
    to its Stamford, CT, location. The best round-trip ping time is 10ms. Those who
    trade with FXCM may have a better chance for lower latency, as they provide

- en: 2) HFT typically operate in markets with high liquidity and low volatility.
    The former is not surprising, since markets with low liquidity has few counter-parties
    to take advantage of. The latter requires a bit of nuance. I think most HFT would
    benefit from high volatility in a mean-reverting market, but unfortunately high
    volatility is usually correlated with market in a free fall. So don't be surprised
    if you find that HFT-provided liquidity suddenly disappears when the market is
    in stress, though the BIS report stated that they are also quick to re-enter the
    market once the turmoil is over.

    NZD and MXN have drawn many automated and HF traders.

    the book for a very short time, measured in ms, unless forced by the exchange
    to stay longer. EBS and Reuters both has minimum quote life or minimum fill ratio.

    of  by a HF player, be wary of Currenex!

    liquidity-redistribution (taking advantage of pricing discrepancies across different
    trading platforms.) Despite the bad reputation HFTers have been acquiring in the
    last few years, I think they do provide a useful service to other algo traders
    like myself via these 2 strategies. It is a hassle to keep looking for a better
    broker/prices for your strategy!'
