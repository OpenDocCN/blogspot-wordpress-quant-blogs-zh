    to hold interest rates low until 2014, I wanted to write about the Fed's role
    in the conduct of monetary policy. There has been a lot of criticism of the Federal
    Reserve from Republican quarters during this presidential primary season. Much
    of it stems from the likes of Ron Paul.

    Speaker Newt Gingrich also said he would fire Bernanke and went further to propose
    a commission to examine returning the U.S. to the gold standard. And Texas Rep.
    Ron Paul has reveled in his unwavering stance of simply ending the Fed.

    returns (however that`s measured), which is comparable to the opposing objectives
    of the dual mandate of the Federal Reserve. What would happen if they were to
    move to a single mandate by trying to either just maximize expected return or
    minimize risk?

    one long and one short. If they were to minimize risk, then the portfolio would

    decisions taken by the Federal Reserve, but the idea of either abolishing the
    Fed or to move it to a single mandate sounds ludicrous to me.
