    from Francophone Wallonia to the west coast sea in the Flemish part of the country.
    Here, *à la mer du Nord*, people relax on white sand beaches and ride the famous
    quadracycles called *cuistax*. The Belgian west coast is the (maritime) backyard
    for many, and so I could not refuse accompanying the two local members of my family
    for a week *à la mer du Nord*. For once, I decided not to take dozens of books
    with me, just one [debated](http://blog.themistrading.com/new-academic-paper-is-the-equivalent-of-94-christie-schultz-study/) [paper](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2367462) entitled
    “Can Brokers Have It All?”, but the sun was so hot that I decided to drink mojitos
    on the beach.

    a small typical Flemish city where I tasted some local beers. A week later I was
    back in Brussels, and on July 16, 2014, Bloomberg released this story about a
    prop trading firm from Chicago purchasing an old tower for €5.000.000 in…Veurne.
    What a coincidence! I’ve researched and written about high-frequency trading (HFT)
    since 2012, and am quite aware of the microwave networks used by some fast players,
    but I did not know that as of January 2013 Jump Trading owned a tall tower in
    Belgium – in my backyard. Belgium being in the middle of the problem, geographically
    speaking, I decided to investigate the presence of microwave networks owned or
    used by the big HFT players here in Europe for my holiday homework. If Jump has
    a tower, competitors are all around – it’s just a matter of *where* . My question
    about the towers was “Can I Have Them All?” and thus my investigation, perhaps
    obsession, began. I discovered too many things to discuss in a single post, so
    I’ve split my story into five parts. This first part we’ll call “Mapping the HFT
    Microwave Networks” – even if “How I Became an Expert in Potato Fields” would
    be as accurate.

    was mostly about the rise of the HFT machines in the pre- and post-REG NMS era.
    Charting the surge of Electronic Communication Networks such as Island, I realized
    the history of Chicago markets in conjunction with the ascent of these technologies
    was more interesting than Wall Street SOES bandit stories. Hence the second and
    last part of the book, *5*, was focused on Chicago, particularly the transitions
    from the old human trading pits to the computerized ecosystem now (co-)located

    by the computerization of commodities and financial markets. I [wrote](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-07-15/wall-street-grabs-nato-towers-in-traders-speed-of-light-quest.html) about
    the arrival of the telegraph in Chicago; the first telegraphic “tweet” arrived
    in Chicago just three months before the first organized exchange, the Chicago
    Board of Trade (CBOT), was created in April of 1848. I even found the phrase “flash
    orders” in some 19th century Chicago newspapers, used to describe the practice
    of traders using fast private telegraphic lines to buy commodities they knew would
    rise in price in the next few seconds so that they could resell at a higher price
    what they had bought seconds before – sound familiar?

    For instance, long before the existence of microwave towers like the one in Veurne,
    the CBOT aimed itself to tower. Its first location was the tallest house in the
    city, and when the exchange was obliged to erect its own building in 1885, it
    was both the tallest property in Illinois and the first building in Chicago to
    run on electricity. Frank Norris describes it in his novel [*The Pit*](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4382):
    “*The lighted office buildings, the murk of rain, the haze of light in the heavens,
    and raised against it the pile of the Board of Trade Building, black, grave, monolithic,
    crouching on its foundations, like a monstrous sphinx with blind eyes, silent,
    grave,—crouching there without a sound, without sign of life under the night and
    the drifting veil of rain*”.'

    cathedral of capitalism”, and initiated discussions with architects, traders and
    some of the major telegraph companies in order to find the best way to improve
    the social space of the pits. The traders weren’t happy with the excess noise,
    and telegraph companies like Western Union and RCA were lobbying to install a
    multitude of fast lines. When the [1930 CBOT building](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Board_of_Trade_Building) was
    erected on Jackson Boulevard near Lasalle Street, it had more than 4300 kilometers
    of telephone lines and 240,000 kilometers of telegraphic lines – first step of
    the rise of the machines. It towered over Chicago until 1965, a faceless statue
    of goddess of agriculture Ceres adorning the top.

    The first pit was [patented](http://www.google.com/patents/US203837) by Ruben
    S. Jennings in 1878, and soon the CBOT build different pits without paying fees
    to Jennings. The inventor tried and failed to sue CBOT, and his patent was [![The
    pit](img/1f8cdbdf1d420d13de22aebe27af57d1.png)](https://sniperinmahwah.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/opalukken-10001.jpg)invalidated
    by the judges. Jennings designed the pit so that a trader could see and hear another
    trader under the best possible conditions. Pits had different steps for that reason;
    a trader sitting on the tallest steps had a better “skyline”, and an advantage
    in seeing or hearing a counterpart quickly, and trade faster than the traders
    in the center/bottom of the pit. It was all about speed.

    physical height became an advantage, which is part of the reason some traders
    were former basketball or football players –“*[taller traders were easier to see](http://www.sps.ed.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/93867/Merc21b.pdf)*”.
    In the 1990s, some traders wore high heels in the pits to trade faster, and inevitably
    experienced injuries due to lack of balance. This prompted the Chicago Mercantile
    Exchange (CME) to impose a ruling making the maximum size of platform heels two
    inches in November 2000\. Standardization of heel height was a way to level the
    playing field in terms of speed on the floor. Recently, the last European open-outcry
    pit the London Metal Exchange, or Ring, [fined](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-07-21/lme-fines-traders-at-dealers-for-standing-in-open-outcry.html) traders

    so by the 1980s and 1990s, computerization of exchanges was rampant. A story documented by
    Donald MacKenzie in “[Mechanizing the Merc: The Chicago Mercantile Exchange and
    the Rise of High-Frequency Trading](http://www.sps.ed.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/93867/Merc21b.pdf)”
    describes what I believe to be a crucial moment in the transition between human
    and electronic transactions. After the CME launched E-Mini contracts in 1997,
    the exchange built a semicircular platform above the pits where the first users
    of Globex terminals were installed. “*So was born ‘the bigs and the littles*’,”
    MacKenzie writes. “*The arbitrage between the pit- traded S&P 500 future and the
    E-Mini, a fifth its size. Pairs of traders would collaborate, one in the pit and
    one sitting above it at a Globex terminal, communicating by hand signals or radio
    headsets*.” The old [hand signals](http://tradingpithistory.com) used by human
    traders since the 1930s – known as “arbs”, they were faster than yelling – now
    pointed to the sky, as if intended to draw the attention of Ceres. The new god
    was not a statue; it was a faceless computer, and Ceres Trading was now a HFT
    firm.'

    “*When you went to the floor, did you see the almost towers, kind of towering
    by the S&P pit? Almost gets to the ceiling, and you get a bunch of guys sitting
    there with terminals? That’s the guys that trade the E-Minis … some of these guys
    are doing very, very, very well, extremely well*.” Note that the ex-trader used
    the word “tower” here, as many HFT firms started on this platform. Getco’s founders
    Daniel Tierney and Stephen Schuler were there, but rereading MacKenzie’s article,
    I realized two other traders were working with Globex terminals on the tower:
    Paul Gurinas and Bill Disomma. The firm they founded in 1999 was none other than
    Jump Trading. Even before the advent of microwave networks, it was all about towers.

    In this new HFT ecosystem, information – between two exchanges for example – needs
    to travel very fast. This has led some HFT competitors to use faster technologies
    than the usual optic fibers, the most recent of which is microwaves. Microwaves
    are actually an old technology with what would appear to be significant drawbacks:
    a dislike for rain and fog, and limited bandwidth of 10% that of optic fibers

    an anthropologist I spent a lot of time to work on these networks: it’s all about
    dominating nature.) If you want to go far, you need tall towers to bypass the curvature
    of the Earth. But tall towers are rare – so they are expensive. What’s more, if

    between the two points. The fact is: sometimes you can’t install your dishes because
