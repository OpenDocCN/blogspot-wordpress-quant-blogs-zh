    disappointment always lies just around the corner and everything important happens
    behind the scenes. But a couple things today give me some cautious hope that regulators
    interpreting the new Basel III banking rules may actually take some real steps
    to curb systemic risks -- they may even take the structure of banking network
    interactions into account.

    flat-footed by recent steps taken by Federal Reserve governor Dan Tarullo. I hope
    this isn't just wishful thinking.

    horrific idea to make the banking system more stable, and why, especially, the
    world will probably end quite soon in a spectacular fiery cataclysm of the biggest
    and most well-connected banks are required to keep an additional few percentage
    points of capital. Johnson dissects these arguments quite effectively and suggests,
    encouragingly, that regulators at the Fed, charged with interpreting Basel III,
    aren't convinced either.

    at least a little attention to what we're learning about banking networks, and
    how some risks are tied more directly to network linkages, rather than to the
    health of banks considered individually. The density of network linkages itself
    matters.

    we monitor the actual network of links connecting banks. It's certainly an encouraging
    step that someone is thinking about this and trying to find ways to bring density
    of linkages into the regulatory equation. I hope they're pondering the figure

    red line) at first falls with increasing diversification and linking between different
    banks, but then abruptly begins rising when the density gets too high.

    (labeled in the figure as diversification, this being the number of links a bank
    has to other banks) from which we should not stray too far, whether the big banks
    like it or not.
