    to have a flexible lookback as a function of market conditions. We used the R-squared
    of price as a proxy for the strength of the trend in the underlying market in
    order to vary the half-life in an exponential moving average framework. The transition
    function used an exponential formula to translate to a smoothing constant. There
    are many reasons why this approach might be desirable from a regime or state dependent
    volatility framework, to improving the  mitigation of tail risk by being more
    responsive to market feedback loops as mentioned in [this article](https://alphaarchitect.com/2017/11/14/can-asset-bubbles-mathematically-quantified-burst/)
    from Alpha Architect. In the latter case, by shortening the volatility lookback
    when the market seems to be forming a bubble in either direction (as measured
    by trend measures such as the Hurst Exponent or R-squared) we can more rapidly
    adjust volatility to changes in the market conditions.

    to follow the approach of forming risk parity portfolios which was inspired by
    [this article](https://blog.thinknewfound.com/2017/11/risk-parity-much-data-use-estimating-volatilities-correlations/)
    by Newfound Research. Our simple Global Risk Parity portfolio uses five major
    asset classes: Domestic Equities (VTI), Commodities (DBC), International Equity
    (EFA), Bonds (IEF), and Real Estate (ICF). The choice of VTI was deliberate since
    we already did the first test using SPY. VTI contains the full spectrum of domestic
    equities including large, mid and small cap whereas SPY is strictly large cap.
    We created simple risk parity portfolios (position size is equivalent to 1/vol
    scaled to the sum of inverse vol across assets) with weekly rebalancing and a
    1-day delay in execution. For realized volatility portfolios we ran each individually
    using various parameters including  20-day, 60-day, 252-day and all history. To
    test adaptive volatility we ran 27 different portfolios that varied the maximum
    smoothing constant and the r-squared lookback. The smoothing constant was varied
    between .1,.5 and .9 and the R-squared lookback was varied using 10,12,15,20,25,30,40,50
    and 60 days. We chose to keep the multiplier (-10 in the original post) the same
    since it was a proxy for the longest possible lookback (all history) by design.
    The testing period was from 1995 to present and we used extensions with indices
    for the ETFs when necessary to go back in time. In the graph below we chart the
    return versus risk for each portfolio.'

- en: We used a line to separate the performance of the realized volatility portfolios
    to better illustrate the superiority in performance of the adaptive volatility
    portfolios. All parameter combinations outperformed the realized volatility portfolios
    on a return basis. In terms of risk-adjusted return or sharpe ratio, the realized
    volatility portfolios fell on the 0%, 3.3%, 13.3% and 33% percentile in the distribution
    of all portfolios- in other words nearly all the adaptive portfolios also outperformed
    on a risk-adjusted basis. Was there any systematic advantage to using certain
    parameters for the adaptive volatility portfolios? As it turns out the maximum
    smoothing constant was less important than the choice of R-squared. We stated
    in the previous post that shorter r-squared parameters on average were more desirable
    than long parameters as long as they weren’t too short so as to avoid capturing
    noise. Shorter lookbacks should allow the adaptive volatility to more rapidly
    adjust to current market conditions and therefore reduce drawdowns and improve
    returns. It turns out that this pattern is validated when we average across smoothing
    constant values (hold them constant) and look at the return relative to maximum
    drawdown (MAR)  as a function of R-squared lookback.

- en: Clearly the shorter-term R-squared values improved the return relative to maximum
    drawdown. While not shown, the drawdowns were much lower and drove this effect,
    while the returns showed a more modest improvement. The drawback to shorter lookbacks
    is increased turnover, which can be mitigated by longer rebalancing windows or
    through improved smoothing measures or rules to mitigate allocation changes without
    materially affecting results. Another alternative is to average all possible r-squared
    and smoothing constant portfolios with a tilt toward shorter r-squared parameters
    to have a good balance between responsiveness and smoothness while mitigating
    the risk of a poor parameter choice.

- en: In conclusion, this simple robustness test appears to show that adaptive volatility
    is relatively robust and may have practical value as a substitute or complement
    to realized volatility. We will do some single stock tests in order to further
    investigate this effect and possibly compare to traditional forecasting methods
    such as GARCH.  Additional exploration on this concept could be done to vary the
    transition formula or choice of trend indicator. Finally, it may be valuable to
    test these methods in a more formal volatility forecasting model rather than using
    just a backtest, and calibrate the parameters according to which are most effective
    every day.
