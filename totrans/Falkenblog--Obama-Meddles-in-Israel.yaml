    everything, is foreign policy, which is even harder than economic policy. It's
    important to know what is and isn't our Federal government's business.

    voted for Obama in 2008\. It certainly is politically beneficial to present yourself
    as a persecuted minority if you can, and just like African-Americans Jews are
    a minority. In the long run, this won't stand because Jews are relatively successful,
    and so via inevitable liberal logic they are a hegemon who needs to share their
    wealth. Obama's call for a return to 1967 borders seems a consistent stand within
    the Democratic party, and especially the very progressive US State Department.
