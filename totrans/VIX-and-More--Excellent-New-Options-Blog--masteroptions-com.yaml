    a must read. Based on the first two posts, it looks as if Dean Mouscher’s [masteroptions.com](http://masteroptions.com/)
    blog is going to be added to that list.

- en: '[What Is an Option Worth?](http://masteroptions.com/?p=3) is Mouscher’s first
    post. The post includes a 45 minute video dedicated almost exclusively to [implied
    volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/implied%20volatility)
    and is one of the best videos I have seen on the subject – and almost certainly
    one of the top free options videos out there. The discussion of implied naturally
    evolves into a fairly detailed treatment of the forces that act upon the VIX,
    making this an excellent primer for the beginning options trader and a worthwhile
    review for intermediate options traders as well.'

    he has to say about implied volatility.
