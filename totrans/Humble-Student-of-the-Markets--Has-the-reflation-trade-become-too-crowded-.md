# Humble Student of the Markets: Has the reflation trade become too crowded?

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2021/03/has-reflation-trade-become-too-crowded.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2021/03/has-reflation-trade-become-too-crowded.html#0001-01-01)

In light of last week's partial NASDAQ reversal, I had a number of discussions with readers about whether the reflation trade has become overly consensus and crowded. To be sure, bond prices have become wildly oversold while the cyclically sensitive copper/gold ratio has surged upward and appears extended.

Is the reflation trade, which is another shorthand for cyclical and value stocks, due for a reversal?
