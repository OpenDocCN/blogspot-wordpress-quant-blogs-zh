    years, because it hasn't been a very safe environment to talk. And finally, we
    have in the United States at least, a President who openly calls for nonbelievers
    to be brought into the big tent...we are at the beginning a hopeful period perhaps...We
    have been through a generation of a very low intensity sort of McCarthy era were
    instead of the House Un-American Committee ... we have had Fox News, we've had
    Lee Atwater, it's been very intimidating to talk, things have changed...

    with The Chosen One in charge, we don't have to fear jack-booted thugs that previously
    impeded financial reform and intellectual progresss. I guess a lot of good ideas
    were kept in the closet because of frequent Bush/FoxNews intellectual waterboarding.

    map for the territory do not include Andy Lo, Emmanuel Derman, Paul Wilmott, physicists

    he is talking about. These guys span the gamut of ways to address economics, and
    are hardly minority views. If these guys get a pass, I don't see who doesn't.

- en: Taleb's schtick is merely to harshly criticize 'conventional wisdom' as practiced
    by those outside his listening audience, flattering his listeners that those morons
    don't get it like 'we' do. Though I find this very dubious reasoning, clearly
    his popularity as a speaker and writer suggest this is an effective rhetorical
    device. If you are well-known and say nice things about Taleb, he'll exempt you
    from his list of idiots and praise you. If you criticize the significance of what
    Taleb is saying, he'll call you an idiot (or, if you don't have a Nobel prize,
    just threaten to sue you, write your boss to get you to stop saying mean things,
    etc.).

  zh: Taleb的把戏只是严厉批评“传统智慧”，这种做法由他听众之外的人在实践，他奉承他的听众那些白痴们不像我们一样懂。尽管我觉得这种推理非常可疑，很明显，他作为演讲者和作家的受欢迎程度表明这是一种有效的修辞手法。如果你有名气，并且对Taleb说好话，他会豁免你不属于他那些白痴的名单，并赞扬你。如果你批评Taleb所说的重要性，他会称你为白痴（或者，如果你没有诺贝尔奖，他会威胁要起诉你，写信给你的老板让你停止说刻薄的话，等等）。
- en: Taleb mentioned some guy who said an event that should have happened once every
    10 thousand years happened three days in a row. Clearly, this guy is describing
    a bad model, and if he really meant it, he is not very smart. I don't see how
    damning this is for economics, because most good economists I know recognize that
    financial time series have fat tails. But, when people pay $50k a speech, they
    expect to hear revolutionary ideas, and without straw men the ideas seem much
    less revolutionary. The idea that if you take a time series with fat tails, and
    process it with a very nonlinear function, it will be very hard to predict the
    outcome, is rather obvious. OLS, variance, are all meaningless. I don't get it.
    What is the alternative, extreme value theory? Chaos theory? For many things,
    you get similar results, because variance is correlated with extremum, and for
    many other applications the standard errors are so large and non-robust to small
    changes in parameters you can't use these models. On the other hand, like Winston
    Smith in 1984 I have been intellectually waterboarded so much, I'm incapable of
    seeing why this observation is so revolutionary (plus, I'm on the Haliburton payroll).

  zh: Taleb提到有人说，一个应该每一万年发生一次的事件连续三天发生了。显然，这个人在描述一个糟糕的模型，如果他是认真的，那他并不聪明。我不明白这对经济学有多大影响，因为我认识的大多数好经济学家都承认金融时间序列具有重尾。但是，当人们支付5万美元一次演讲时，他们期望听到革命性的想法，如果没有替代方案，这些想法看起来就不太革命性。如果你拿一个带有重尾的时间序列，并用一个非常非线性的函数进行处理，预测结果将会变得非常困难，这个想法是显而易见的。OLS（普通最小二乘法），方差都是毫无意义的。我不明白，替代方案是什么，极值理论？混沌理论？对于许多事情，你会得到类似的结果，因为方差与极值相关，在许多其他应用中，标准误差如此之大，并且对参数的微小变化非常不稳健，你不能使用这些模型。另一方面，就像1984年的温斯顿·史密斯一样，我被知识上的拷问如此之多，我已经无法看出这一观察是如此革命性的（再加上，我是哈里伯顿的雇员）。
