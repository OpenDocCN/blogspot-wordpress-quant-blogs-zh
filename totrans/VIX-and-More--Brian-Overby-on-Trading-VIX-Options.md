> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/11/brian-overby-on-trading-vix-options.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/11/brian-overby-on-trading-vix-options.html#0001-01-01)

Overby, who is Director of Education at

[TradeKing](https://www.tradeking.com/)

and authors an informative options blog,

[Options Guy](http://optionsguy.financialblogs.com/post/app/blog/)

, tackles some of the idiosyncrasies of the VIX and has some excellent suggestions for those who insist on trading the volatility index. Frankly, there is close to 100% overlap between what he says and what I believe about the VIX.

I recommend clicking through to the

, but in a nutshell, Overby’s thinking boils down to the following:

1.  VIX options do not follow the (cash) VIX index

2.  To understand the price action in VIX options, look at [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures)

3.  When trading VIX options, trade the front month (closest contracts to expiration)

4.  Trade VIX options when the VIX is at the extremes of its trading range

5.  Utilize a [mean reversion](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/mean%20reversion) trading strategy

6.  Look to sell [vertical spreads](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/vertical%20credit%20spread) (sell puts when the VIX is low; sell calls when the VIX is high)
