    many large market movements do not appear to be linked to the sudden arrival of
    public information in the form of news. Both comments noted that this may leave
    out of the picture another source of information -- private information brought

    in the market (or at least many of them) may be revealing some fragment of private
    information on the part of whoever makes the trade. In principle, it might be
    such private information hitting the market which causes large movements (the

    in the sense that "prices move in response to new information about fundamentals"
    -- essentially becomes true by definition. After all, everyone agrees that trading
    drives markets. If all trading is assumed to reveal information, then we've simple
    assumed the truth of the EMH. It's a tautology.

    Certainly some trades do reveal private information, as when a hedge fund suddenly
    buys X and sells Y, reflecting a belief based on research that Y is temporarily
    overvalued relative to X. Equally, some trades (as mentioned in the first comment)
    may reveal no information, simply being carried out for reasons having nothing
    to do with the value of the underlying stock. As there's no independent way --
    that I know of -- to determine if a trade reveals new information or not, we're
    stuck with a hypothesis we cannot test.

    consider large price movements -- those in the fat-tailed end of the return distribution.
    One proposed idea looking to private information as a cause proposes that large
    price movements are caused primarily by large-volume trades by big players such
    as hedge funds, mutual funds and the like. Some such trades might reveal new information,
    and some might not, but let's assume for now that most do. In

    information, expressed in large trades, might account for the no-news s jumps
    noted in the Jouvin study. (It seems less plausible that such revealed information
    might account for anything as violent as the 1987 crash, or the general meltdown
    of 2008). But taken at face value, these arguments at least seem to be consistent
    with the EMH view that even many large market movements reflect changes in fundamentals.
    But again, this assumes that all or at least most large volume trades are driven
    by private information on fundamentals, which may not be the case. The authors
    of this study themselves don't make any claim about whether large volume trades
    really reflect fundamental information. Rather, they note that...

    the assumed relationship between large returns and large volume trades isn''t
    correct. This analysis is fairly technical, but is based on the study of minute-by-minute
    NASDAQ trading and shows that, if you consider only extreme returns or extreme
    volumes, there is no general correlation between returns and volumes. The correlation
    assumed in the earlier study may be roughly correct on average, but it not true
    for extreme events. "Large jumps," the authors conclude, "are not induced by large
    trading volumes."'

    private information don't want it to be revealed immediately in one large lump
    because of the adverse market impact this entails (forcing prices to move against
    them). A well-known paper by Albert Kyle from 1985 showed how an informed trader
    with valuable private information, trading optimally, can hide his or her trading
    in the background of noisy, uninformed trading, supposing it exists. That may
    be rather too much to believe in practice, but large trades do routinely get broken
    up and executed as many small trades precisely to minimize impact.

    other factors. The important thing, again, is to consider what this means for
    the most meaningful sense of the EMH, which I take to be the view that market
    prices reflect fundamental values fairly accurately (because they have absorbed
    all relevant information and processed it correctly). The evidence suggests that
    prices often move quite dramatically on the basis of no new information, and that
    prices may be driven as a result quite far from fundamental values.

    that the explanation comes from the fact that markets, even when they are ‘liquid’,
    operate in a regime of vanishing liquidity, and therefore are in a self-organized
    critical state [31]. On electronic markets, the total volume available in the
    order book is, at any instant of time, a tiny fraction of the stock capitalisation,
    say 10^(−5) −10^(−4) (see e.g. [15]). Liquidity providers take the risk of being
    “picked off”, i.e. selling just before a big upwards move or vice versa, and therefore
    place limit orders quite cautiously, and tend to cancel these orders as soon as
    uncertainty signals appear. Such signals may simply be due to natural fluctuations
    in the order flow, which may lead, in some cases, to a catastrophic decay in liquidity,
    and therefore price jumps. There is indeed evidence that large price jumps are
    due to local liquidity dry outs.
