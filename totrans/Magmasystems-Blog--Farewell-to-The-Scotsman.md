# Magmasystems Blog: Farewell to The Scotsman

Our token Scot has moved on to make Market Data Magic at another firm. One of the truly great market data experts in the world ... I am sure that we will be meeting at the Brandy Library for a snifter or two, if you can manage to drag yourself downtown (take the S or 7 to Times Square, then take the 1 downtown to Franklin Street).

I might even get

[Mike Roberts](http://www.mikebroberts.com/blogtastic/)

to join us, since he seems to be a frequenter of that establishment. (Mike, take the 2 uptown to Chambers St, transfer for the 1.) Maybe we can convince him to move his

to the Brandy Lib. Wouldn't it be fun to try to convince Mike (the author of CruiseControl.Net, when he was at Thoughtworks) to join our little group as the CI/Agile expert.... We can even get CD down so I can steal some dispatch patterns from him.
