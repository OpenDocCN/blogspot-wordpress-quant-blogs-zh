- en: Over the holidays it was easy to ignore the low volume and dismiss it as typical
    holiday traffic. Traders may have now returned but trading volume is still lacking.
    The low volume isn’t blatantly obvious because it’s still higher than it was during
    the holidays. Still, it’s definitely going in the wrong direction here. Below
    is a study I looked at last night using SPY.

    the very near future. (And based on the futures the pullback could be starting
    this morning.)
