    of discussion about just how low we can expect the VIX to go in the next few months.

    I predicted that the VIX will likely not drop below the 25-27 area in the current
    bull market. That prediction has held up so far, but will almost certainly be
    tested during the summer months.

    of sorts for trading, with volume tailing off, portfolio managers on vacation
    and stocks sometimes set to cruise control. As a result, most people equate summer
    with lower volatility.

    the truth of the matter is that we are now at the seasonal cycle low, with volatility
    historically increasing dramatically from June through October. In fact, over
    the course of the past two decades the increase in volatility has been highest
    from June to July, increasing by over 10% (1.82 points.) The pattern is quite
    distinct in the chart below, which shows composite monthly volatility from January
    1990 through last month, using 100 as the series mean.

    global recession are put to rest in the next few months, lower volatility will
    have to counter the established seasonal cycle.
