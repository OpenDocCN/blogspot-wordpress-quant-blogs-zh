    exposure only to the project’s intangible property. Since the project is open
    source, it probably has limited intellectual property (though it does own [trademarks](https://www.ethereum.org/brand)).

    yet to hit a situation where the combination of funds set aside in the initial
    sale and tokens held back have run out — yet. This is a close equivalent to running
    out of cash and the options pool in a typical company. Ethereum, for example,
    hasn’t hit this bump yet because 1) it’s young and 2) the price of ETH vs every
    fiat currency has, more or less, been on the rise, making the ETH the Ethereum
    Foundation set aside last longer. As a result, we’ve never seen the idea of multiple
    fundraises as is common with startups. Running out of funds for future development
    seems likely, as work on these protocols is never really “done”, although they
    may mature and change less over time…

    to handle the funds raised. The most common structure at the moment is setting
    up an (often Swiss) foundation. This foundation has some governance, much like
    the corporate governance you’d see in a normal company, which determines both
    the initial and ongoing distribution of funds raised. This is what Ethereum has
    done, more or less.

    you can think about the proceeds — whether it’s Ether or dollars from the pre-sale
    — as like the cash that a company might raise. And then the tokens that they hold
    back as kind of like the options pool, more or less. One thing I think is interesting
    that we haven’t seen a whole lot of yet in the world is: (And this happens at
    companies and startups all the time) What happens when those initial funds from
    the initial fundraise run out? Right? There’s kind of this model at least so far
    — and these are all really early projects — of we just do one fundraise and hopefully
    that just funds the thing in perpetuity. I’m guessing that that will not continue
    forever. With Ethereum, one of the main reasons it’s worked so far is: just like
    a successful company, the Ether that the foundation holds have appreciated quite
    significantly in value — meaning they could continue to pay for development more
    and more and more. So one thing I’m quite interested in is: what happens in the
    future, when those initial funds that we held back start running out and we want
    to continue funding the development of these protocols.'

    from a global network of investors. Crowdsales lower the barrier to entry for
    developers working on high risk projects. Since Ethereum launched in July 2015
    we have seen unprecedented amounts of funds raised for decentralized applications
    through crowdsales. Ethereum itself was funded through a crowdsale that raised
    $18 million in bitcoin and a project called The DAO raised $160 million.

    Currently, the exchange supports only four assets (BTC, ETH, LTC and BCH). Part
    of the reason we trade only those four assets is that each has been determined
    by regulators to be a virtual currency and therefore not a security. We are studiously
    avoiding listing tokens that could be determined to be securities because we are
    not currently licensed to trade securities and cannot take the risk of inadvertently
    trading an asset that is later found to be a security…

    potential new asset is not a security under U.S. law.
