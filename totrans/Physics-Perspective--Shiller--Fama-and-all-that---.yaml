- en: on the strange choice for this year's Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences
    in Memory of Alfred Nobel. For readers of the column I wanted to give a few more
    links here to some stuff I've written before on the Efficient Markets Hypothesis,
    an idea that I think has been cause for an enormous waste of intellectual energy
    over 40 years or so. It has many versions. They are either 1) clearly false and
    so uninteresting or 2) clearly and unsurprisingly true, and hence uninteresting.
    That's my opinion in short; links to more extended discussions below.

- en: The aforementioned Prize certainly involves a weird juxtaposition of two names
    -- Robert Shiller and Eugene Fama -- that you wouldn't normally think of seeing
    together. The one, Shiller, is a great enthusiast for markets, but also a staunch
    realist who thinks markets can and do go awry in lots of ways, creating bubbles,
    wasting resources, etc. The other, Fama, is a great enthusiast for markets who
    thinks they never go wrong, ever, and have an almost magical capacity to steer
    investments wisely (I think, but it's pretty hard to know exactly what he believes).
    So wait -- I guess they are clearly linked after all by the label "market enthusiast."
    There the similarity ends.

- en: for a discussion of the perversions of normal logic often used by defenders
    of the EMH to prop the idea up in the face of all evidence. If writing papers
    about the EMH was banned I think finance would immediately take a step in the
    right direction. I just don't think it is interesting. Saying that the "market
    is hard to beat" and is therefore "efficient" in some peculiar sense isn't saying
    much at all.
