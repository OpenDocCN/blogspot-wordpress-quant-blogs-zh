- en: Hi John, Im not sure what the beta of the Livermore has been recently, however
    over the long term it hovers between 1 and 1.25\. The relative performance is
    primarily alpha-driven, but the composition can vary as a function of numerous
    factors such as aggregate intra-index correlations and volatility etc.
