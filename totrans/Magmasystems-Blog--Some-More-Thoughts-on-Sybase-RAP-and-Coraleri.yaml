  zh: 首先，一些简要的消息...
- en: Congrats to Terry Cunningham, the former CEO of Coral8\. It looks like he is
    now a Senior VP over at i365, which is a Seagate company. I guess that Terry will
    be wearing a dual hat, as he is also the Chairman of Aleri. One wonders if Seagate
    will eventually go into the CEP business :-)

  zh: 祝贺 Terry Cunningham，前 Coral8 CEO。看起来他现在是 Seagate 旗下 i365 公司的高级副总裁。我猜 Terry 将会兼任两个职务，因为他还是
    Aleri 的董事长。人们不禁思考 Seagate 是否最终会进入 CEP（事件处理）业务 :-)
- en: Also, good luck to Mark Tsimelzon. A few people at Coral8 have remarked that
    Mark is no longer with the combined entity. With Mark's track record, I am sure
    that he will be involved with something new and interesting.

  zh: 同时，祝福 Mark Tsimelzon。一些 Coral8 的人提到 Mark 已经不再与合并后的实体一起了。鉴于 Mark 的履历，我相信他肯定会参与一些新的、有趣的事情。
- en: It looks like Coraleri has chosen Coral8's CCL to be the SQL-based language
    of choice for developing Coraleri applications. This is the first piece that is
    falling into place, and for me, it's good news. Now, we have to wait to for the
    Splash integration to happen, and then the second piece of the puzzle will be
    solved.
  id: totrans-9

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 看起来 Coraleri 已经选择 Coral8 的 CCL 作为开发 Coraleri 应用程序的基于 SQL 的首选语言。这是第一个落实的部分，对我来说是个好消息。现在，我们必须等待
    Splash 整合的发生，然后拼图的第二部分就会解决。
- en: The latest Coral8 5.6.1 has lived up to its claims of major performance enhancements.
    My CEP team reports that CPU usage is down significantly in our tests on our most
    complex queries.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 最新的 Coral8 5.6.1 符合其主要性能增强的宣称。我的 CEP 团队报告称，在我们最复杂的查询测试中，CPU 使用量显著减少。
- en: With Coral8 making big strides in performance, the case to keep the Aleri CEP
    engine around is weakening. Don DeLoach is adamant that none of their customers
    will need to rewrite a single line of code, and that Aleri has even put it in
    writing. I know that Don believes this with all of his heart, but I am still a
    bit skeptical. But I am willing to cut them a big piece of slack, as long it does
    not affect what we are doing with Coral8\. We are continuing on as if nothing
    happened, and I am trusting in Don and the Coraleri team to make the transition
    completely transparent to us.

  zh: 随着 Coral8 在性能方面取得重大进展，保留 Aleri CEP 引擎的理由正在减弱。Don DeLoach 坚决表示，他们的任何客户都不需要重写一行代码，甚至
    Aleri 已经书面承诺。我知道 Don 从内心深处相信这一点，但我还是有点怀疑。但只要这不影响我们对 Coral8 的工作，我愿意给予他们大量的支持。我们继续按照一切照旧进行，并且我相信
    Don 和 Coraleri 团队能够使过渡对我们完全透明。

  zh: 这就引出了我下一个主题…… Sybase RAP 和 Coral8。
- en: For this topic, I am putting on the other hat that I wear, which is Chief Architect
    of Equities. One of the jobs of the Architect is to keep abreast of the current
    technologies that we use to see if any of them will approach an "end-of-life"
    situation. Chief Architects needs to make sure that the company does not invest
    in any technology that might be risky in any way.

  zh: 对于这个主题，我戴上了另一个帽子，那就是我担任的职位之一，即 Equities 的首席架构师。架构师的一项工作是及时了解我们使用的当前技术，以查看它们是否会接近“寿命尽头”。首席架构师需要确保公司不会投资于任何可能存在风险的技术。
- en: Almost every large investment bank has one of every technology. I am not giving
    away any of our secret sauce when I say that we have a number of applications
    that use Sybase ASE for the database. So, when Sybase comes knocking on my door,
    asking me if I am interested in their new CEP product, what do I think?
  id: totrans-14
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 几乎每家大型投资银行都有每一种技术。当我说我们有许多应用程序使用 Sybase ASE 作为数据库时，我并没有透露我们的任何机密。所以，当 Sybase
    来敲我的门，问我是否对他们的新 CEP 产品感兴趣时，我会怎么想呢？
- en: First, I think it is a bit curious that Sybase did not publicly mention the
    use of Coral8 as their CEP engine. I can now understand why. I can speculate that
    Sybase knew of the pending acquisition of Coral8 by Aleri, and wanted to avoid
    some of the confusion that goes along with a merger like this. If I knew that
    a company's product was based on another vendor's product, and that other vendor
    had just gotten acquired by another company, I would need to be absolutely sure
    that all of the moving parts were going to have a long life, and that we would
    not be faced with an end-of-life situation. I could imagine more that a few sweaty
    brows at Sybase when Coral8 said that they were selling to Aleri. I am sure that
    Sybase did not want this consternation to leak out to their potential customers.
    So, better not to mention the association between Coral8 and Sybase RAP. If this
    was the primary reason for the silence, then I can certainly appreciate that.
  id: totrans-15

  zh: 首先，我觉得Sybase没有公开提到使用Coral8作为他们的CEP引擎有点奇怪。我现在可以理解为什么了。我猜测Sybase知道Coral8即将被Aleri收购，想要避免这种合并带来的混乱。如果我知道一个公司的产品是基于另一个供应商的产品，而那个供应商刚刚被另一家公司收购，我会需要绝对确定所有的部件都会有长久的生命力，我们不会面临生命周期结束的情况。当Coral8表示他们要卖给Aleri时，我敢想象Sybase那边一定有不少人急得头上冒汗。我敢肯定Sybase不希望这种担忧泄露给他们的潜在客户。所以，最好不要提及Coral8和Sybase
    RAP之间的联系。如果这是沉默的主要原因，那么我完全可以理解。
- en: But, as the Architect, I would also want to know what Sybase's plans are for
    the future of their Coral8 engine. Sybase bought the source code to Coral8\. Does
    Sybase plan on getting continuous enhancements from Coral8 as the Coral8 engine
    and language evolves? Does Sybase plan a separate fork of the source code so that,
    eventually, the Coral8 engine and language and the Sybase RAP engine and language
    are two different things? Will Sybase RAP eventually incorporate Aleri's Splash
    language? These are things that are very important to us. We would need to see
    Sybase's roadmap as well as Coraleri's roadmap.

  zh: 上，但作为架构师，我还想知道Sybase对Coral8引擎未来的计划。Sybase购买了Coral8的源代码。Sybase计划从Coral8获得连续的改进，随着Coral8引擎和语言的发展吗？Sybase计划对源代码进行单独的分叉，以至于最终Coral8引擎和语言以及Sybase
    RAP引擎和语言成为两回事吗？Sybase RAP最终会整合Aleri的Splash语言吗？这些都是对我们来说非常重要的事情。我们需要看到Sybase的路线图以及Coraleri的路线图。

- en: Are there other details on the deal? Is this a one time source code tree fork?
    Will Sybase get new versions from Aleri? It would be interesting to hear if Sybase
    they will develop it itself further or if bugfixes, patches and new features will
    come from Aleri’s developers?

  zh: 这个交易的还有其他细节吗？这是一次性的源代码树分叉吗？Sybase会从Aleri获得新版本吗？有趣的是，如果Sybase他们会自己进一步开发，或者bug修复、补丁和新功能会来自Aleri的开发人员？

    business terms between Sybase and Aleri.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 抱歉，我们不会发布关于交易条款的更多细节。这些都是Sybase和Aleri之间的商业条款。
- en: That's a bit scary. I can understand the financial terms not being released
    (although it would be interesting to see if Coraleri gets a piece of every Sybase
    RAP sale, as that would help with Coraleri's financials). But not giving transparency
    into Sybase's plans is not good news for Sybase, although it is a positive for
    Coraleri. I have no transparency into whether Sybase will be upgrading their engine
    based on the upcoming work of Coraleri, and that does not sit well with me.
  id: totrans-23
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 这有点令人不安。我可以理解财务条款没有公布（尽管有趣的是，如果Coraleri从每笔Sybase RAP销售中获得一部分收入，这将有助于改善Coraleri的财务状况）。但不透露Sybase的计划透明度对Sybase来说不是好消息，尽管这对Coraleri来说是个积极的因素。我无法了解Sybase是否会根据Coraleri即将进行的工作升级他们的引擎，这让我感到不安。
- en: Sybase RAP can be used without the CEP portion. However, I do not know what
    other parts of RAP are dependent on other third-party vendors, and whether these
    other parts are subject to any risk. And, it looks like it has some overlap with
    KDB+ and with Vhayu. (I wonder if there is a third-party comparison between the
    three.)
  id: totrans-24

  zh: Sybase RAP可以不使用CEP部分。然而，我不知道RAP的其他部分是否依赖于其他第三方供应商，以及这些其他部分是否面临任何风险。而且，它看起来与KDB+和Vhayu有一些重叠。（我想知道是否有第三方对这三者进行了比较。）
- en: I will not be recommending Sybase RAP for consideration until some of these
    underlying questions are answered. The current situation just leaves too many
    questions unanswered. I would welcome a bit more transparency from Sybase.

  zh: 在这些问题没有得到解答之前，我不会推荐Sybase RAP进行考虑。当前的情况留下了太多未解答的问题。我期待Sybase能提供更多的透明度。
