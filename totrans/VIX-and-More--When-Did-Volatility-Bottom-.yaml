- en: If an investor were to have a VIX-centric view of the universe, he or she might
    reasonably conclude that as far as 2009 is concerned, volatility bottomed just
    before Thanksgiving, when the VIX made its intraday low for the year (20.05 on
    11/25) or on the previous day, when the VIX had its lowest close of the year at
    20.47.

    then the lows in historical volatility for the 10 day, 20 day and 30 day measures
    all fell in the second half of September. Further, an even more comprehensive
    volatility measure, [average true range](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/average%20true%20range)
    (ATR), also shows volatility bottoming in the second half of September. As the
    chart below shows, ATR has not come close to touching its September and October
    lows during the last month. On the other hand, the VIX is in a more definitive
    downtrend and continued to make new lows in November.

    out, market expectations of future volatility have continued to decline. With
    the [holiday effect](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Holiday%20Effect)
    expected to put a more pronounced damper on volatility starting next Monday, I
    would not be surprised if the VIX takes one last run at the sub-20 level before
    the end of the year. After the first of the year, however, I would expect historical
    volatility and implied volatility measure such as the VIX to start to track more
    closely. Whether this means historical volatility will rise to meet the VIX or
    the VIX will fall toward historical volatility levels remains to be seen.
