# Humble Student of the Markets: Why the next recession will be very ugly

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2015/12/why-next-recession-will-be-very-ugly.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2015/12/why-next-recession-will-be-very-ugly.html#0001-01-01)

In a recent post, I was relatively upbeat about the near term market outlook but warned that the next recession could be very ugly (see

[A major bear market in 2016?](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2015/12/14/will-we-see-a-bear-market-in-2016/)

). To explain, I have found three possible time bombs that are set to go off at the next recession:

*   The Fed's balance sheet;
*   A possible financial crisis in China because of her inability to re-balance its economy fast enough; and
*   Possible blowups lurking in the global financial system.
