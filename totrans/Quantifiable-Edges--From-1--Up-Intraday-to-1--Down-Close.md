Below is a study that appeared in last night's Subscriber Letter that looks at Tuesday's volatile action.

A few notes:

1) While results are explosive, instances are very low. Rather than including this among my Active Studies List I have simply decided to track it going forward.

2) Without the 200ma filter the results are no longer bullish. There were some big declines followingthis type of action during a downtrend.
