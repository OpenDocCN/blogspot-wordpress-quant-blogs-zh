- en: Take a look at Citibank's balance sheet as of the third quarter of 2008\. The
    company had about $2 trillion in assets, versus about $132 billion in shareholder
    equity, for a gross leverage ratio of about 16-to-1\. That's not a comfortable
    figure, because it indicates that a decline of about 6% in those assets would
    wipe out Citibank's equity and make the bank technically insolvent. Unfortunately,
    we saw credit default spreads screaming higher last week, while the bank's stock
    dropped below $2 a share, so evidently the market is deeply concerned about the
    possible immediacy of that outcome.

    over $360 billion in long-term debt to the company's bondholders, and another
    $200 billion in shorter term borrowings. None of that is customer money. That
    puts the total capital available to absorb losses at $132 + $360 + $200 = $692
    billion, which is about 35% of the $2 trillion in assets carried by Citibank.
    That's a huge cushion for customers, who are unlikely to lose even if Citibank
    becomes insolvent. Should that occur, the proper response of government will not
    be to defend Citi's bondholders at taxpayer expense, but rather, to take Citi
    into receivership, wipe out the shareholders and most of the bondholders, and
    sell the assets along with the liabilities to customers to another institution…

    by large and continued infusions of taxpayer funds should be allowed to “fail”
    through the process of government receivership. ***It is wrong to squander the
    taxes of ordinary citizens and put a burden of indebtedness on our children in
    order to protect the bondholders of careless and poorly-managed financial institutions***.

    the U.S. government to insulate China from losses. The Chinese attitude to business

    sounds emerging from Hillary Clinton’s recent visit to China, could efforts to
    reorganize the U.S. financial system be hampered by U.S. efforts to maintain a
    friendly Sino-American relationship? The aforementioned article went on to speculates
    that “the Obama administration may be waiting for China to reduce its exposure
    to the debt of the latest U.S. financial institutions found lying near death’s
    door before it nationalizes them.”
