- en: Thanks to Steve Barber and some of the other members of the Streambase tech
    support team. I could not get an out-of-process, .NET-based adapter to communicate
    with the Streambase engine on my laptop, although it worked fine on my office
    machine.

- en: The Streambase people worked during the slow holiday season to diagnose the
    problem. It was caused by a DLL called BMNET.DLL that was installed by my Cingular/ATT
    Communications Manager. I have a Cingular broadband card that I use to connect
    to the internet when I am on the road and don't have a free wireless connection
    to tap into. BMNET.DLL provides data acceleration to the Internet.
