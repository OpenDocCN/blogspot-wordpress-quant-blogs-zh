    (SNPs). In 30 years I expect there will be lots of genetic scoring as is done
    for consumer loans, where one knows one's propensity towards X based on the distributional
    frequency of your SNPs relative people with X, where X could be a disease, a psychological
    trait, IQ, athletic ability, etc. As genetic sequencing becomes cheaper, I imagine
    this will be done, and as with consumer credit scoring, millions of datapoints
    make theory pretty irrelevant, people look at the patterns. It should be very
    interesting.

    age of Playboy centerfolds has risen, fallen, or stayed constant. As you can see
    from the graph below, the average age has, indeed risen from about 21 to about
    23 over the past 50 years, about the same change in age of Hugh Hefner's girlfriends
    over that same period.

    also dug up data on the average age of pornstars since 1968 (no trend), while
    Miss America has trended up from about 16 to 22 over the past 90 years. A later
    post looked at the relative preferences for blondes vs. brunettes by looking at
    Maxim, and found
