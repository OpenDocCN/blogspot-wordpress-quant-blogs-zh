    Supposing that you hired the manager, or bought his fund, as part of the diversified
    equity portion of your portfolio and he missed by 5% in a year. Let's say that
    you be patient, then he underperforms by another 5% in the next six months. Would
    you fire someone who lags the market by 10% in 18 months?

    benchmark huggers, but investors get very nervous when their managers lag the
    market by as little as 5-10% in a relatively short (1-3 years) time frame. From
    the perspective of the manager, this level of risk tolerance brings up the issue
    of business risk. How do you maximize performance using your process, or "secret
    sauce", without taking on excessive business risk that sinks the entire firm?

  zh: 我遇到过一些人，他们说喜欢那些取得巨大成功的人，而讨厌那些跟随基准的人，但是当他们的基金经理在相对较短的时间（1-3年）内市场表现落后5-10%时，投资者会变得非常紧张。从经理的角度来看，这种风险承受能力提出了业务风险的问题。你如何使用你的流程，或者“秘密酱料”，在不承担过度的业务风险的情况下最大化绩效？

    of risk are sector and industry risk, market cap risk and stock specific risk.
    To illustrate my example, consider the lowly issue of stock specific risk, which

    example in risk control. In the past few weeks, I have spoken to a number of Canadian
    portfolio managers whose performance was blindsided by specific risk from that
    one single stock, The outlook for VRX is highly divisive and talking about it
    is the equivalent of bringing up touchy topics like religion or gun control in
    polite company. (Incidentally, I have no opinion on the stock.) The chart below

- en: The analysis brings up a key question for the business risk for investment management
    operations. Yes, we would all like to have the courage to bet our investment convictions,
    but how much business risk is the practice willing to take? Supposing that an
    operation were to lose half its clients because of a single decision on a stock,
    what does that do to the bottom line? Revenues would go down by about 50%, but
    there are fixed costs such as rent, salaries, systems, legals, etc. Profitability
    would plunge in such an instance, is the investment management business willing
    to take that kind of risk?

  zh: 这项分析提出了投资管理业务风险的关键问题。是的，我们大家都希望有勇气下注我们的投资信念，但业务风险实践愿意承担多少？假设一个运营因为对一只股票的一次决策而失去一半的客户，这对底线有什么影响？收入将减少约50%，但还有如租金、工资、系统、法律等固定成本。在这种情况下，盈利能力会大幅下滑，投资管理业务愿意承担这种风险吗？
- en: If not, then there are a couple of steps a manager can do. First, he has to
    decide the appropriate level of stock specific risk he is willing to take against
    the benchmark. Supposing a stock has a 3.5% weight in the benchmark, would you
    hold a 0% if you ranked it a "sell" (-3.5% bet), a non-zero weight, such as 2.5%
    (+/- 1% vs, benchmark) or 1.5% (+/- 2% vs. benchmark)? On the other hand, if your
    ranked it a "buy", would a 5.5% weight (+/- 2% vs. benchmark) be appropriate?
    What about 8.5% (+/- 5% vs. benchmark)?
  id: totrans-17

  zh: 如果不然，那么管理者可以采取几步措施。首先，他必须决定相对于基准，他愿意承担的股票特定风险的适当水平。假设一只股票在基准中的权重为3.5%，如果你将其评为“卖出”（-3.5%的赌注），你会持有0%吗？或者，比如2.5%的非零权重（相对于基准±1%）、1.5%的权重（相对于基准±2%）？另一方面，如果你将其评为“买入”，5.5%的权重（相对于基准±2%）是否合适？8.5%的权重（相对于基准±5%）呢？
- en: Another way of approaching the problem would be to try and determine the median
    competitor weight in the stock (with techniques that I have written about before).
    Then set benchmark weight to be the median competitor weight instead of the index
    weight.
