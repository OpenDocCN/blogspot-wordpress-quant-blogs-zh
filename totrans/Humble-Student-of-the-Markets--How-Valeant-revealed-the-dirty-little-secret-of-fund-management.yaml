    Supposing that you hired the manager, or bought his fund, as part of the diversified
    equity portion of your portfolio and he missed by 5% in a year. Let's say that
    you be patient, then he underperforms by another 5% in the next six months. Would
    you fire someone who lags the market by 10% in 18 months?

    benchmark huggers, but investors get very nervous when their managers lag the
    market by as little as 5-10% in a relatively short (1-3 years) time frame. From
    the perspective of the manager, this level of risk tolerance brings up the issue
    of business risk. How do you maximize performance using your process, or "secret
    sauce", without taking on excessive business risk that sinks the entire firm?

    of risk are sector and industry risk, market cap risk and stock specific risk.
    To illustrate my example, consider the lowly issue of stock specific risk, which
    should be diversifiable (at least according to theory).

    example in risk control. In the past few weeks, I have spoken to a number of Canadian
    portfolio managers whose performance was blindsided by specific risk from that
    one single stock, The outlook for VRX is highly divisive and talking about it
    is the equivalent of bringing up touchy topics like religion or gun control in
    polite company. (Incidentally, I have no opinion on the stock.) The chart below
    depicts the price of VRX in the top panel and the TSX-VRX ratio in the bottom
    panel, which shows what would have happened to relative performance had a manager
    had no position in VRX for the past few years.

    8% when VRX hit its peak this year. For some investment organizations, that kind

- en: The analysis brings up a key question for the business risk for investment management
    operations. Yes, we would all like to have the courage to bet our investment convictions,
    but how much business risk is the practice willing to take? Supposing that an
    operation were to lose half its clients because of a single decision on a stock,
    what does that do to the bottom line? Revenues would go down by about 50%, but
    there are fixed costs such as rent, salaries, systems, legals, etc. Profitability
    would plunge in such an instance, is the investment management business willing
    to take that kind of risk?

    decide the appropriate level of stock specific risk he is willing to take against
    the benchmark. Supposing a stock has a 3.5% weight in the benchmark, would you
    hold a 0% if you ranked it a "sell" (-3.5% bet), a non-zero weight, such as 2.5%
    (+/- 1% vs, benchmark) or 1.5% (+/- 2% vs. benchmark)? On the other hand, if your
    ranked it a "buy", would a 5.5% weight (+/- 2% vs. benchmark) be appropriate?
    What about 8.5% (+/- 5% vs. benchmark)?

- en: Another way of approaching the problem would be to try and determine the median
    competitor weight in the stock (with techniques that I have written about before).
    Then set benchmark weight to be the median competitor weight instead of the index
    weight.

    an entire investment management practice. I haven't even gone into all the other
    ways that risk can rear its ugly head, such as macro factor, sector, size and
    so on.
