    times are excellent. During the early 1990s, I went into a retail eyeglass store
    for new glasses and an eye exam. The optometrist saw something that he didn’t
    like and referred me to an ophthalmologist at the local hospital, who discovered
    that I had a retinal detachment and scheduled me for surgery. The total time from
    the day I walked into the optometrist to the day of the scheduled surgery was
    two days. You can’t ask for anything better than that.

    examined the treatment received by a million elderly Americans diagnosed with
    colon or rectal cancer, a hip fracture, or a heart attack. They found that patients
    in higher-spending regions received sixty per cent more care than elsewhere. They
    got more frequent tests and procedures, more visits with specialists, and more
    frequent admission to hospitals. Yet they did no better than other patients, whether
    this was measured in terms of survival, their ability to function, or satisfaction
    with the care they received. If anything, they seemed to do worse.

    it became a dirty word)? In an ideal world, an HMO assesses the patient’s health
    and risk factors and then puts resources into preventative care, which is a lot
    cheaper, rather than being reactive with treatment, which can be enormously expensive.
    Under the current system, many doctors are siloed in their own specialties and
    there is little coordination and consideration of overall care.

    what’s wrong with the system. The Canadian health care system’s problems aren’t
    necessarily the waiting times, which can be frustrating, but extra and unexpected
    costs that were not part of the initial design. The system was conceived and financed
    in a day when the practice of medicine consisted mainly of doctors and nurses,
    either in a standalone practice or in a hospital. Fast forward a few decades,
    we now have a huge array of medical equipment and drugs that are available to
    the practitioner.

    equipment (like MRIs). Given the structure built into the system of nurses’ unions,

    her foot and went to the hospital. She was offered a plaster cast for free. If

    of paying a contractor to pull a team together and keep them on track, you paid
    an electrician for every outlet he recommends, a plumber for every faucet, and
    a carpenter for every cabinet. Would you be surprised if you got a house with
    a thousand outlets, faucets, and cabinets, at three times the cost you expected,
    and the whole thing fell apart a couple of years later? Getting the country’s

    going to solve this problem. Nor will changing the person who writes him the check.

    The US has built a health care system where doctors become salesmen. In a number
