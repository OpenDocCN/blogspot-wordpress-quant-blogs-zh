    The following is a review of Trading Regime Analysis by Gunn, consistent with
    Quantivity’s on-going market regime theme and in response to reader request.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Readers seeking rigorous quantitative treatment of regime analysis will be disappointed
    (as frequently and gleefully acknowledged by the author), as the text seeks to
    analyze regimes primarily through anecdotal behavioral finance and an idiosyncratic
    basket of technical analysis. That said, the text *builds intuition and ultimately
    endorses numerous intellectual themes which similarly underlie rigorous quantitative
    analysis of market regimes*.

- en: This is admittedly an unexpected curiosity. Thus, value lies in observing how
    this regime intuition is framed by a certified technical analyst, voyeuristically
    from the perspective of a quant. Despite TA arguably serving as the intellectual
    ancestor of quantitative analysis (as introduced in [Why Moving Averages](https://quantivity.wordpress.com/2010/01/08/why-moving-averages/)),
    very rarely do technical and modern quantitative analyses converge on intuition.
    As with any intellectual juxtaposition, such curiosity merits study.

    regimes are driven by volatility measured in context of *price ranges* (as measured

    analytic rigor, many quant strategies are conceptually similar to the intuition
    illustrated in Figure 3.12'

    a “trading regime grid” (p. 301). Readers familiar with the quant blogosphere
    will find remarkable *conceptual* similarity between this grid of technical indicators
    and various quantitative “state of the market” summaries (including the proposed
    [Market Regime Dashboard](https://quantivity.wordpress.com/2009/08/23/market-regime-dashboard/)).

    juxtaposition.
