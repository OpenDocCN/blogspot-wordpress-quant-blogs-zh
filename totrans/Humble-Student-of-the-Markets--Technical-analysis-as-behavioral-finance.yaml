- en: I think it's the most convincing book I've read so far that links the mechanisms
    of the recent crisis to crises in the past. In effect, he argues that the crisis
    was the direct result of the uncontrolled creation of money by the shadow banking
    sector, and ultimately took place as a classic bank run, no different from runs
    in the past, except that this run took place mostly out of public view because
    it didn't involve ordinary bank deposits. The new kind of money in this bank run
    was stuff such as repo agreements and commercial paper which played the role of
    money for financial institutions. In 2007-2008, when lenders lost confidence (for
    good reason) in the mortgage-backed collateral backing this money, they demanded
    that money back, and the financial system seized up.

    because Gorton does a masterful job of placing this bank run in the context of
    the long history of past runs. And also because Gorton, as an economist, places
    blame squarely on the economics profession (himself included) for being asleep
    at the wheel:'

- en: Think of economists and bank regulators looking out at the financial landscape
    prior to the financial crisis. What did they see? They did not see the possibility
    of a systemic crisis. Nor did they see how capital markets and the banking system
    had evolved in the last thirty years. They did not know of the existence of new
    financial instruments or the size of certain money markets. They did not know
    what "money" had become. They looked from a certain point of view, from a certain
    paradigm, and missed everything that was important... ***The blindness is astounding.
    That economists did not think such a crisis could happen in the United States
    was an intellectual failure.***

    have noticed, in talking about the ideas in this book with my economist colleagues,
    that there is a fairly clear generational divide on this. To younger economists
    and graduate students, it is obvious that there was an intellectual failure. Some
    older economists are inclined to hem and haw, resorting to farfetched rebuttals.
    It is clear that this is a sensitive issue, as like banks no one wants to have
    to write down the value of their capital.

    insight into how just the right amount of bread gets to London in the morning
    by assuming that the baker and the other participants in the market pursue their
    own interests in a sensible manner. The rational-agent model takes this idea to
    its logical extreme. If you want to predict the behavior of a market, you are
    best off assuming individual agents who act in a way that is predictable and fairly
    simple—for example by assuming that the participants are similarly motivated and
    exploit all their opportunities. I am not an economist, but I find it hard to
    imagine that they will ever give up the use of schematic individual agents, even
    if they endow these agents with a little more realistic psychology. And I see
    no reason why they should.

- en: The rational agent model has more questionable consequences in the domain of
    policy because the assumption that individuals are rational in the pursuit of
    their interests has an ideological coloring and policy implications that many
    would view as unfortunate. If individuals are rational, there is no need to protect
    them against their own choices. At the extreme, no need for Social Security or
    for laws that compel motorcycle riders to wear helmets. It is not an accident
    that the department of economics at the University of Chicago, one of the most
    illustrious in the world, is known both for its adherence to a strict version
    of the rational actor model and for very conservative politics.
