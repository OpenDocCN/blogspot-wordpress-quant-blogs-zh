- en: One of the more amazing things I’ve noticed about the rally over the last 2
    weeks is that it has come without any 1% Follow Through Day (FTD) on rising volume.
    Investors’ Business Daily first published and popularized the concept of the Follow
    Through Day (FTD). Though they have changed the definition slightly over the years,

- en: This puts this rally in uncharted territory, which is always a little bit of
    an uncomfortable place for me. A FTD could still occur, and just because we have
    had a strong 9-day rally does not mean a bull market has already been missed.
    But one purpose of the FTD concept is to help in identifying market bottoms. If
    we are already at a 50-day high, then I would say this is one case where the FTD
    has let traders down in try to identify that bottom.

  zh: 这使得这次反弹进入了一片未知的领域，这对于我来说总是有点不舒服。FTD仍然可能发生，而且仅仅因为我们有了一次强劲的9天反弹并不意味着牛市已经错过。但FTD概念的一个目的就是帮助识别市场底部。如果我们已经达到了一个50天的高点，那么我会说这是FTD在尝试识别底部时让交易者失望的一个案例。
- en: '*Note: There was a 1% FTD in the Russell 2000 last week.  I do not look at
    the Russell 2000 for FTD purposes.  My studies have always looked at the Dow,
    Nasdaq, and SPX.  The Nasdaq goes back to 1971, and I wanted to be sure to include
    that index initially.  The Russell only has history back to the mid-80s.  I feel
    consistency is important when testing and therefore I only look at those 3\.  IBD
    and others may sometimes look at additional indices.  For consistency in testing,
    I don''t.  And this is the 1st rally where none of those 3 have registered the
    FTD before hitting a 50-day high.*'

    只追溯到80年代中叶。我认为在测试中保持一致性很重要，因此我只关注这三个。IBD和其他人有时会看更多的指数。为了测试的一致性，我不这样做。这是第一次在没有达到50天高点之前这三个都没有注册FTD的反弹。*'
