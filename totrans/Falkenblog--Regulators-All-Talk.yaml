- en: The problem when someone is given authority to regulate something really complicated,
    where the agents under regulation have vastly more knowledge of the product landscape
    than they do, is that the regulators know they don't know what they are talking
    about. For all Warren has studied credit cards and mortgages, I bet she still
    doesn't know what the expected charge-off rate is on 550-600 FICO credit cards
    off the top of her head. The participants know this stuff inside and out.

  zh: 当某人被授予监管产品领域比他们更熟练的代理人进行监管的权力时，监管者知道他们并不了解他们在谈论什么。尽管沃伦研究了信用卡和抵押贷款，但我敢打赌她还不知道550-600
    FICO信用卡的预期呆账率。参与者对这些东西了如指掌。
- en: Thus if they create a stupid law making X illegal, all the industry does is
    create a slight modification and generates the same result, or a different industry
    takes up the slack with more onerous terms. Worse, like the Carter credit controls
    (which caused a GDP tailspin in 1980:Q2), it can totally shut down a market, highlighting
    their ham-handedness. Thus, regulators rarely do anything that might have a conspicuous
    effect (eg, they passed a health care overhaul that will be rolled out in such
    a fashion people will never agree as to the effects)

  zh: 因此，如果他们制定一条愚蠢的法律，使X违法，行业所要做的只是进行一点修改，产生相同的效果，或者其他行业通过更严苛的条件接替。更糟糕的是，就像卡特信用控制（导致1980年第二季度GDP暴跌）一样，它可以完全关闭一个市场，凸显出他们的粗劣。因此，监管机构很少采取可能产生显著影响的措施（例如，他们通过了一项将以一种难以同意效果来推出的医疗改革）
- en: Smarmy Warren's initial big idea was to simplify and standardize contracts.
    Thus, instead of having a mortgage contract with tens of pages in 10-point font,
    requiring 10+ initialings, you have one page with simple terms a regular person
    can understand. Unfortunately, simplification comes with a cost. It groups many
    contingencies under one big tent, and so specifics can not be spelled out. When
    someone gets screwed by some specific clause and did not foresee it, they have
    historically argued to courts this was unfair, which created the lengthy documentation.
    The many pages and initials are meant to capture these cases, and now must be
    inferred.

  zh: 糖衣沃伦最初的大想法是简化和标准化合同。因此，不需要通过一份10页、10号字体，需要签署10次以上的抵押合同，而是一张简单术语普通人可以理解的页面。不幸的是，简化是有代价的。它把许多偶发事件归为一类，因此无法具体说明。当有人被一些具体的条款坑了，而没有预见到，他们通常向法庭辩解这是不公平的，这就产生了冗长的文件。许多页和签字是为了涵盖这些情况，现在必须进行推断。
- en: 'So, pick your poison: a simple general statement that hopes people can figure
    out the special cases, or list all the special cases, making the general statement
    more obscure. I''m all for standardization, but the banks will reasonably demand
    indemnification for such simplicity, and the Trial Lawyers will fight it. She''s
    going to be shocked when her push-back comes from her side of the aisle.'

    agencies that produce lots of stuff no one cares about. Highlighting the regulators
    continued cluelessness, they raise the 'equal access to credit' as a right as
    opposed to the signature problem that led to the mortgage bubble. Discriminating
    on ability and/or willingness to pay invariably hits certain demographics differently,
    so this is a classic efficiency/equity trade-off, and we know where the government
    stands. The implications, however, are not obvious, as many still think this had
    absolutely nothing to do with the mortgage meltdown.

  zh: 这些目标已被其他数十家甚至数百家独立覆盖机构所涵盖，这些机构提供了许多无人关心的信息。突显监管者持续的无知，他们提出‘平等获得信贷’作为一种权利，而不是导致抵押贷款泡沫的标志性问题。歧视能力和/或支付意愿无疑会对某些人群产生不同的影响，所以这是一个典型的效率/公平权衡问题，而且我们清楚政府立场。然而，此举的影响并不明显，因为仍有许多人认为这与抵押贷款危机毫无关系。
- en: I'm sure Warren is happy as a pig in poop creating her new fiefdom with all
    the status it implies. As the first director, surely several conference rooms,
    pavilions, if not entire building will have her name on them after she leaves.
    As to actually helping the consumer, say by proposing specific data that would
    increase transparency, that would take greater understanding of the product landscape
    than she and her ilk have. For example, why not make it easy for investors to
    see the track record of investment advisers and hedge funds? Currently, getting
    that data is not merely difficult, but often illegal! How about making it easier
    to see who has sued whom and for what? If someone has sued several prior colleagues
    and a neighbor, that's darn useful information, but currently it is made very
    difficult to acquire. Why not take over the rating agencies production of 'default
    studies' with your own, independent validation, so that we can see how AAA and
    BB ratings do for various categories without the tendentious reporting?

  zh: 我确信沃伦正欢度其创建新的势力范围时的幸福多如猪沐浴在粪便中。作为首位董事，毫无疑问，她离开后会有好几个会议室、亭子，如果不是整栋楼以她的名字命名。至于实际帮助消费者，比如提出可以增加透明度的具体数据。那需要比她及其同类型人士具有更深的产品领域的了解。比如，为什么不让投资者方便地看到投资顾问和对冲基金的投资记录？目前，获取这些数据不仅困难，而且通常是违法的！怎么不让人们更容易地看到谁起诉了谁，因为什么而起诉了谁？如果有人曾起诉过几个以前的同事和邻居，那是非常有用的信息，但目前很难获取这些信息。为什么不接替评级机构制作‘违约研究’，并提供独立的验证，这样我们就能看到AAA和BB评级在各个类别中的表现如何，而不受倾向性的报道影响？
