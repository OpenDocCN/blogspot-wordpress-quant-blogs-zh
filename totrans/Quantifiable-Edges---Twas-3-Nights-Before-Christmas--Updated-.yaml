- en: In this blog I will be examining market action and quantifying my findings.
    Using sentiment, breadth, price and volume indicators - both standard and customized
    - I will try and uncover short-term edges which could be taken advantage of by
    market participants. I will frequently add opinion to these studies and may sometimes
    post opinions without quantifiable research behind them.
