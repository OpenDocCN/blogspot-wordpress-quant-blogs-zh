# VIX and More: Portfolio A1 Bounces Back

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/01/portfolio-a1-bounces-back.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/01/portfolio-a1-bounces-back.html#0001-01-01)

While it was not a big bounce, the fact that Portfolio A1 bounced 1% more than the benchmark S&P 500 index did last week has to be considered a good sign.  After 49 weeks, the portfolio’s 6.4% gain still compares quite favorably to the 8.6% loss in the SPX over the same period.

New addition [Terra Industries (TRA)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=tra) led the way with an 8.6% gain for the week, after taking the fertilizer baton from previous portfolio anchor, [The Mosaic Company (MOS)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=mos).

The 2008 year to date numbers (through Friday) show that Portfolio A1 has fallen faster than the SPX – -12.8% vs. -8.7% – with the superior cumulative performance numbers for the portfolio largely a reflection of a superb fourth quarter in 2007.  Some may see this as a possible anomaly, but this portfolio is set up to ‘fish for whales,’ a theme I will expound upon in the future.

There no changes to the portfolio this week.

A snapshot of Portfolio A1 is as follows:
