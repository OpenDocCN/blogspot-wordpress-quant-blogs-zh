    graphics, I was surprised to see that I have featured a chart of the SPX only
    once in the past five months ([Chart of the Week: Lack of Volume and Breadth Threatens
    Bull Move](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/06/chart-of-week-lack-of-volume-and.html))
    and decided that this most important of indices needs to take center stage more
    often.'

- en: Alas, this week’s chart of the week shows a year of SPX daily bars, with some
    standard moving averages and [Bollinger Bands](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Bollinger%20bands),
    as well as a set of Fibonacci retracement lines that have generated considerable
    discussion in the past ([SPX and Fibonacci Resistance at 966](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Bollinger%20bands).)
    The new twist on this chart is a simple ratio of the NASDAQ-100 ([NDX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/NDX))
    to the SPX, which is included as a study above the main graph. The [NDX:SPX ratio](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/NDX%3ASPX)
    shows that while the SPX was retreating from its June 12^(th) high, the NDX was
    outperforming the SPX on a relative basis, as has been the case for the past two
    months. Spurred on by a very strong earnings report from Intel ([INTC](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/INTC))
    the NDX:SPX ratio is currently at its highest level since early 2001 and the NDX
    is now comfortably above its June high.

    have topped its June high is health care ([XLV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLV))
    with consumer staples ([XLP](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLP))
    just 0.03 below that high water mark. With the leadership role of technology should
    be considered a positive sign for bulls, the high relative strength of defensive
    sectors such as health care and consumer staples might be considered a warning
    sign.
