- en: Due primarily to some massive trading in index calls in the last ½ hour of the
    day on Tuesday, the CBOE index put/call ratio actually finished lower than the
    CBOE equity put/call ratio. This has only ever happened 4 other times since they
    began tracking the data in 2003\. It’s dangerous to try and draw conclusions from
    only 4 instances, but I found the results below interesting enough to share. I’ll
    continue to monitor this setup in the future to see if the early indications hold
    true.

    and intermediate-term.
