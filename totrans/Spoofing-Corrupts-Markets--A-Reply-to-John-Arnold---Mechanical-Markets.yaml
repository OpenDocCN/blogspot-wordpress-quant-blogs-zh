- en: In financial markets, to “spoof” means to make a bid or offer for a security
    or commodity with the intent of cancelling the order before it is executed. It
    is designed to create a false sense of investor demand in the market, thereby
    changing the behavior of other traders and allowing the spoofer to profit from
    these changes.

  zh: Market Impact Does not Signify Front-Running
- en: But why does he think that spoofing improves market quality? Central to his
    argument is that some high-frequency traders operate strategies which, by detecting
    patterns in market data, anticipate order flow by large institutional traders.
    These strategies certainly exist and likely do increase the market impact of orders
    sent by large traders before they’ve reached their desired position. Arnold labels
    these strategies “front-runners,” a gross misuse of the term. Cliff Asness has
    [written](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-06-20/why-i-love-high-speed-trading)
    extensively about why. In essence, almost every trader, short or long-term, engages
    in this activity. The price of a financial instrument is simply a value at which
    its supply and demand are balanced. If you are predicting the price of an instrument,
    then you are predicting its future order flow – and vice versa. It is entirely
    possible that even the most blatant order-anticipation strategies (like those
    hypothesized by Michael Lewis to trade ahead of Bats’s routed orders) are, in
    the eyes of their developers, solely predicting price. A statistical model could
    detect patterns that sometimes correspond with orders being in-flight, even if
    the model’s operator has no inkling of this fact. You might even call the human
    brain a very fancy statistical model, which would mean that when a human trader
    successfully predicts a price, they have done exactly the same thing. The only
    traders who can honestly say that they are not engaging in what Arnold and others
    call “front-running” are those who will take their positions literally to the
    grave. I understand that there are such traders [[1](#bottom1)], but it is not
    the [common case](https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/DDEM01USA156NWDB).

  zh: 但他为什么认为欺诈能提高市场质量呢？他的论点核心在于一些高频交易者运行的策略，通过检测市场数据中的模式，预期大型机构交易者的订单流。这些策略确实存在，并且很可能增加了在大型交易者达到期望的仓位之前他们发出的订单的市场影响。阿诺德将这些策略称为“抢跑者”，这是一个对该术语的滥用。克iff·阿斯尼斯（Cliff
    Asness）[[1](#bottom1)]广泛地写过关于为什么这样。本质上，几乎每个交易者，无论短期还是长期，都从事这种活动。金融工具的价格简单来说就是其供求达到平衡时的价值。如果你预测一个工具的价格，那么你就在预测其未来的订单流——反之亦然。几乎可以肯定，即使是最明显的订单预期策略（如迈克尔·刘易斯（Michael
    Lewis）假设的用来交易在Bats路由订单之前的策略）在开发者眼中，也仅仅是在预测价格。一个统计模型可能检测到有时与订单在途相对应的模式，即使模型的操作者对此一无所知。你甚至可以把人脑称为一个非常高级的统计模型，这意味着当一个人类交易者成功地预测了一个价格，他们确实是在做同样的事情。唯一可以诚实地说自己没有从事阿诺德和其他人所说的“抢跑”行为的交易者是那些把他们的仓位
    literally 带到坟墓里的人。我明白存在这样的交易者 [[1](#bottom1)]，但这并不是[常见情况](https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/DDEM01USA156NWDB)。

    strategies “front-running”, it’s not even clear that spoofing would render them
    unprofitable. In fact, some order-anticipation strategies might detect spoofing
    and piggy-back onto it (perhaps unbeknownst to the operator). If so, it would
    be the spoofer who sees HFT-associated market impact costs. If spoofing were permitted
    and became widespread, we would likely see these spoofing-immune strategies multiply.
    The HFT ecosystem invariably adapts when new behaviors occur on the market.

    can see these trades, much less react to them in real time.” Of course, you could
    define “spoofing” as something that must occur for no more than “a tenth the time
    that it takes the human eye to blink.” But that is not the definition everybody
    else uses. In fact, [one case](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-01-13/spoofers-tricked-highspeed-traders-by-hitting-keys-fast)

- en: Even if we exclude cases such as this one and legalize the submission of spoofed
    orders with the proviso that they stay live for less than 100ms, there are plenty
    of unsophisticated market participants who would still be harmed. These days,
    algorithmic trading tools are used by a wide class of traders. There is an entire
    industry, possibly larger than that of vanilla HFT, focused on creating and marketing
    these tools. Tremendous volume is executed via algorithms on behalf of traditional
    long-term traders.[[2](#bottom1)] I’m not an expert on such algorithms, but my
    impression is that they tend to be much less sophisticated than a lot of vanilla
    HFT, and thus more likely to be tricked by spoofing. A basic example of one such
    execution algorithm would be a peg order, which is priced in a very simple [fashion](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/?f=%2Fen%2Ftrading%2Forders%2Fpegmid.php)
    somewhere in between the best bid and ask. If a spoofer alters the best bid then
    a peg order will change its price in response, leaving the user open to losses.

    我不是这方面的专家，但给我的印象是，这些算法通常不如很多香草HFT复杂，因此更容易受到欺骗的影响。此类执行算法的一个基本例子是挂单，其定价方式非常简单，位于最佳买入价和卖出价之间。[挂单详情](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/?f=%2Fen%2Ftrading%2Forders%2Fpegmid.php)。如果欺骗者改变了最佳买入价，那么挂单会相应地改变其价格，使用户面临损失的风险。

    of damaging order-anticipation strategies. Could you do so in a fashion that didn’t
    also allow other kinds of nasty manipulation? I don’t see how. Manipulation via
    self-trading is probably a behavior that everybody agrees should be prohibited.
    When a manipulator trades with themselves, they can do so risk-free at an arbitrary
    price, giving other traders a false sense of the market price.[[3](#bottom3)]
    Self-trading can be extremely damaging to market integrity. But which group, I
    wonder, is most hurt by self-trading? One could argue that so-called “front-runners”
    are. For example, say Apple stock is currently trading at $100, and a manipulator
    trades 10 million shares with themselves at $90\. There could be order-anticipation
    algorithms, ‘predicting’ selling to come, that react to this and sell Apple stock.[[4](#bottom3)]
    There could also be strategies that take this as a signal that there will soon
    be selling across the entire sector, and sell stocks in related companies. These
    algorithms fall under Arnold’s definition of “front-running,” and would be expected
    to lose money when the manipulator decides it’s time to push Apple stock back
    to $100\. Does that mean we should celebrate the manipulator? No.[[5](#bottom3)]
