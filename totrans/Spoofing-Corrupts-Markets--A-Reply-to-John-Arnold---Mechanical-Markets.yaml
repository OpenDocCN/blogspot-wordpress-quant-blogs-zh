    that spoofing, a long-banned [practice](http://blogs.wsj.com/briefly/2015/02/22/5-things-to-know-about-spoofing-in-financial-markets/),
    “keeps markets honest.” His points are thought-provoking and I think that there’s
    room for a serious debate on whether anti-spoofing rules have gone too far. Nonetheless,
    I believe his reasoning is flawed.

    or commodity with the intent of cancelling the order before it is executed. It
    is designed to create a false sense of investor demand in the market, thereby
    changing the behavior of other traders and allowing the spoofer to profit from
    these changes.

    argument is that some high-frequency traders operate strategies which, by detecting
    patterns in market data, anticipate order flow by large institutional traders.
    These strategies certainly exist and likely do increase the market impact of orders
    sent by large traders before they’ve reached their desired position. Arnold labels
    these strategies “front-runners,” a gross misuse of the term. Cliff Asness has
    [written](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-06-20/why-i-love-high-speed-trading)
    extensively about why. In essence, almost every trader, short or long-term, engages
    in this activity. The price of a financial instrument is simply a value at which
    its supply and demand are balanced. If you are predicting the price of an instrument,
    then you are predicting its future order flow – and vice versa. It is entirely
    possible that even the most blatant order-anticipation strategies (like those
    hypothesized by Michael Lewis to trade ahead of Bats’s routed orders) are, in
    the eyes of their developers, solely predicting price. A statistical model could
    detect patterns that sometimes correspond with orders being in-flight, even if
    the model’s operator has no inkling of this fact. You might even call the human
    brain a very fancy statistical model, which would mean that when a human trader
    successfully predicts a price, they have done exactly the same thing. The only
    traders who can honestly say that they are not engaging in what Arnold and others
    call “front-running” are those who will take their positions literally to the
    grave. I understand that there are such traders [[1](#bottom1)], but it is not
    the [common case](https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/DDEM01USA156NWDB).

    increasing execution costs for large traders. Whether or not you call such statistical
    strategies “front-running”, it’s not even clear that spoofing would render them
    unprofitable. In fact, some order-anticipation strategies might detect spoofing
    and piggy-back onto it (perhaps unbeknownst to the operator). If so, it would
    be the spoofer who sees HFT-associated market impact costs. If spoofing were permitted
    and became widespread, we would likely see these spoofing-immune strategies multiply.
    The HFT ecosystem invariably adapts when new behaviors occur on the market.

    know full well that spoofing harms traders of all stripes. Perhaps this comment
    indicates that they could do a better job explaining that to participants. Why
    does Arnold believe spoofers can’t harm traditional traders? Because “[n]o human
    can see these trades, much less react to them in real time.” Of course, you could
    define “spoofing” as something that must occur for no more than “a tenth the time
    that it takes the human eye to blink.” But that is not the definition everybody
    else uses. In fact, [one case](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-01-13/spoofers-tricked-highspeed-traders-by-hitting-keys-fast)
    that Arnold cites alleges spoofed orders that are live for around 30 seconds,
    more than enough time to trick human traders into submitting orders of their own.

    orders with the proviso that they stay live for less than 100ms, there are plenty
    of unsophisticated market participants who would still be harmed. These days,
    algorithmic trading tools are used by a wide class of traders. There is an entire
    industry, possibly larger than that of vanilla HFT, focused on creating and marketing
    these tools. Tremendous volume is executed via algorithms on behalf of traditional
    long-term traders.[[2](#bottom1)] I’m not an expert on such algorithms, but my
    impression is that they tend to be much less sophisticated than a lot of vanilla
    HFT, and thus more likely to be tricked by spoofing. A basic example of one such
    execution algorithm would be a peg order, which is priced in a very simple [fashion](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/?f=%2Fen%2Ftrading%2Forders%2Fpegmid.php)
    somewhere in between the best bid and ask. If a spoofer alters the best bid then
    a peg order will change its price in response, leaving the user open to losses.

    of damaging order-anticipation strategies. Could you do so in a fashion that didn’t
    also allow other kinds of nasty manipulation? I don’t see how. Manipulation via
    self-trading is probably a behavior that everybody agrees should be prohibited.
    When a manipulator trades with themselves, they can do so risk-free at an arbitrary
    price, giving other traders a false sense of the market price.[[3](#bottom3)]
    Self-trading can be extremely damaging to market integrity. But which group, I
    wonder, is most hurt by self-trading? One could argue that so-called “front-runners”
    are. For example, say Apple stock is currently trading at $100, and a manipulator
    trades 10 million shares with themselves at $90\. There could be order-anticipation
    algorithms, ‘predicting’ selling to come, that react to this and sell Apple stock.[[4](#bottom3)]
    There could also be strategies that take this as a signal that there will soon
    be selling across the entire sector, and sell stocks in related companies. These
    algorithms fall under Arnold’s definition of “front-running,” and would be expected
    to lose money when the manipulator decides it’s time to push Apple stock back
    to $100\. Does that mean we should celebrate the manipulator? No.[[5](#bottom3)]

    I doubt spoofing would completely ruin our financial markets, but it would impose

    prospect of receiving dishonest prices. That seems like reason enough to ban it.[[6](#bottom6)]

    Or, adjust their consumption and production accordingly. Or even trade, knowing

    would be very explicit order-anticipation. When you think of it like this, order-anticipation
    is an essential activity in a capitalist society. Without it, there’s a massive
