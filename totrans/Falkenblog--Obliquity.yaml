    a very profound subject with admirable brevity (200 pages). He notes the story
    of seeing three stone masons working on a medieval cathedral, and one says 'I
    am cutting stones to shape', one says 'I am building a great cathedral', and one
    says 'I am working for the glory of God.' These highlight that actions are guided
    by a hierarchy of objectives some short term, some long term, and some prove better
    guides than others.

    work. Enjoying the journey and knowing you are on the right path removes the pressure
    and angst associated with an excessive focus on the end-goal, making that same
    goal more achievable. I think the key point he makes is to have all levels working
    for you, by adjusting all of them in light of feedback. An example is golf, a
    sport which for many is a 'game worth playing', making it worthy, and which benefits
    from practice and coaching, yet ultimately you can only swing well if you don't
    think when you are doing it.

    and discovery in uncertain environments. Higher-level objectives, intermediate
    goals, and basic actions are constantly reassessed. The problem is that the big
    goals--a fulfilling life, maximizing shareholder value--are too imprecise to have
    any clear idea how to do them. As GE CEO Jack Welch noted, maximizing shareholder
    value is not a useful guide because it doesn't help you know what to do when you
    come to work.

    how to use common sense. To always think outside the box is to ignore the great
    toolkit of algorithms and methods smart people have given us so we do not have
    to reinvent, say, ordinary least squares or t-statistics. Common sense may be
    a straight jacket, but letting every wacky idea into your mind leads to insufficient
    focus. Quantification is imperfect, and can lead to useless reification as with
    macroeconomics, but its still the ultimate benchmark, and indeed, allows us to
    know that macroeconomics does not work. I know success, happiness, justice, are
    impossible to objectively and uniquely quantify, but I think modest attempts to
    provide proxies are helpful.
