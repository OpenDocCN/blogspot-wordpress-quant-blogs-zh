- en: A 68-year-old Des Moines man fired from a Wells Fargo call center for putting
    a cardboard dime in a washing machine in 1963 has been cleared to return to work
    in the banking industry, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said. Wells Fargo
    is under no obligation to rehire Richard Eggers, however... Wells Fargo said it
    was simply complying with the regulations, which carry a $1 million-a-day fine...
    A 1950 federal law prevents FDIC-insured banks from employing workers who have
    been convicted of a crime of dishonesty or breach of trust. In 2008, Congress
    passed a law that forced mortgage loan originators to perform similar employee
    background checks.

    merely generates an exception not a rewrite.

    no faith in discretion. As Phillip Howard has argued, discretion dominates rules
    because reality is always more complicated than any rule contemplates. Yet by
    law bad outcomes can be legal under discretionary frameworks, so lawmakers like
    zero-tolerance policies because in theory that eliminates the perceived problem.

    enthusiastic about regulations fixing rather than causing problems in the financial
    industry can't rely on history, as financial regulations have been and continue
    to be generally irrelevant. We have one set of regulators who look over hard copies
    of all our traders personal stock trades, presumably to look for front running.
     This is silly for two reasons. First, we don't have retail flow like a brokerage,
    so we would be hurting our company for personal gain in this case, and clearly
    we have a greater incentive to stop such individual malfeasance than regulators.
    Secondly, looking at literally hundreds of thousands of company trades, and comparing
    them to a stack of personal trades in hard copy (with various formatting), is
    like looking for a risk premium using covariances, a waste of time.
