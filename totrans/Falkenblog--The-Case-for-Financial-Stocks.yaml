    of the recent meltdown. They are not merely symptoms of the excessively foolish
    subprime crisis, but were active participants, a stunning combination of negligence,
    stupidity, and greed.

    that was 'too good to check' I guess. I'm betting this error is a combination
    of off-the-cuff loss estimates--eg, 1 Trillion USD, which was global not US--and
    using nominal dollars. Using Ken French's

    highest return since then, Banks 5th. An investor forced to choose sectors in
    1926 would have done much better in financials or banks than the average equity
    investment.'

- en: A common bank profitability metric is Return on Assets (ROA). On average, a
    bank makes 1% on assets, historically. Now, if you look at the entire financial
    sector, (say using S&P/MSCI Barra's GICS from 5000-5280), you see the average
    NetIncome/Assets of 0.78% since 1989, including the most recent year. The graph
    shows the ROA for all US banks since 1984 as

    earnings in the financial sector included a lot of large write-offs, but the net
    for the year 2008 was near zero earnings, not something that returned total earnings
    for the sector to zero from the beginning of recorded history.'

    current price, and the estimates for earnings next year, the ratio is 13\. But
    this average ignores the fact that the largest stocks have the lowest P/Es: KeyCorp,
    National City, Citigroup, Wachovia, Comerica. If'

    over the past 20 years), and the P/E were then equal to the median P/E, the bank
    sector's market cap as a whole would rise 150%. That is, if all banks earned 0.78%
    of assets going forward, and if they all had P/Es of 13, the total sector market
    cap would be $519B for the top 50 US banks, not $204B. This is an example of what
    Warren Buffet calls a 'low risk' idea, because the expected return is so great,
    you have to have a lot of wrong assumptions to underperform a benchmark of say,
    12% annual return.

    market too high (his example is Citigroup). I think these banks have been written
    down aggressively in part because the new regimes want to have a new base to benchmark
    against, and the failures of the past are already the fault of prior regimes (they
    wish to assert, anyway). So, if you are a new CEO of a troubled company, or just
    acquired a troubled company and have access to the US Federal Government's $700
    TARP funds, you want to write down as much as possible. I don't think they are
    holding back, but I can see how smart people, at 30,000 feet, think this is all
    so obvious.

    greater than 50%, as financials have recently done. Not that they make it all
    back, hardly, but they have good returns their first year out of the crisis nonetheless.
    Biotech in 1992, Oil in 1980, the Nifty 50 in 1972, Japan in 1990, Tech in 2002\.
    Things don't go down forever. Of course, the future may not be like the past,
    but I think it is our best guess going forward. The financial decline has been
    going on since May of 2007, and I think the worst-case-scenario is already baked
    into financial market prices.
