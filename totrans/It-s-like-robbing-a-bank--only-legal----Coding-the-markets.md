## It’s like robbing a bank, only legal…

### June 4, 2006

[David Craig](http://www.consulting-moneymachine.com/index.html) has produced a [new book](http://www.consulting-moneymachine.com/plundering_the_public_sector.html) on the huge amounts of money squandered on IT consultants by the NHS in recent years. You can [download the first chapter](http://www.consulting-moneymachine.com/choices.html) of his previous book on management consulting: [Rip Off !](http://www.consulting-moneymachine.com/ripoff.html)

My own local council has been the [victim of consultants](http://waynehoban.org/news/83.html?PHPSESSID=9851740f9036100898946b182fa8d472). And I have witnessed at first hand a bank spending $25M on a system that never went live and was subsequently binned.

Why does it happen ? Because the interests of the conultants, maximum billing, are misaligned with those of the client, project done and consultants gone.

Why isn't it stopped ? Because the managers who hire the consultants hush up the disasters to protect their careers.
