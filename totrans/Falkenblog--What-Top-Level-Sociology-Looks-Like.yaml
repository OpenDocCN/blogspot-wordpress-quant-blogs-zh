- en: Olin notes Wikipedia is based on his ideals and works, ergo...I guess, why not
    have General Motors and Google run that way! He's a fan of neighborhood participatory
    budget assemblies, as local communities serve the commonweal without the inefficiency
    and duplicity of Washington. He didn't mention it, but as he's a good liberal
    (Marxist, actually) I'm sure he's against states' rights, or cutting state taxes
    to replace with local property taxes, and for all sorts of Federal regulations.

    thoughtful guy. He's just worked himself into an intellectual cocoon where his
    silly talk seems respectable. As a 'scientist', he presumes his simple biases
    are actually fact-based, but he is so selective in his view of the data, it highlights
    that education mainly allows us to articulate our prejudices better. He highlights
    that one can be an intellectual, respected by one's peers, have an esteemed affiliation,
    and be totally clueless.
