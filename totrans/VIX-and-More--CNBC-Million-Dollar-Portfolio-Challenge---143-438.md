![](img/eb2fa6396ff249815f40b00d7b612c45.png)It’s not as bad as <city st="on"><place st="on">Roy</place></city> ‘[Tin Cup](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117918/)’ McAvoy blowing up on the 18^(th) hole, but shaving $700,000 off of my CNBC portfolio in just a week was still quite a feat – if you are impressed by people who can run backward and that sort of thing.

There are now [1,603,782 contestants](http://www.cnbc.com/id/18537677) in this parade of silliness, so thanks to their collective mediocre performance, I have somehow managed to stay in the top 9%.  All you need to know about last week is that Friday’s [LeapFrog Enterprises (LF)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=lf&hl=en) gambit turned out to be my best pick of the week at -1.5%.

Fortunately, the ship seems to have been righted today, as [Flamel Technologies (FLML)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=flml&hl=en) is up 7.3% at the moment.  I’d really like to make it back into at least the top 5% before the contest ends on Friday. It looks like FLML will be a good first step.  My earnings pick for today will probably come from [this group](http://finance.yahoo.com/q/cq?s=cutr,dcel,pwav,svnt,nile,jcom,hlys,sons,aqnt,slxp&d=v1) that has been selected by my [earnings spike potential algorithm](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/earnings%20spike%20potential%20algorithm).  I’m still debating which one I should put all my chips on.

There are no [mulligans](http://golf.about.com/cs/historyofgolf/a/hist_mulligan.htm) on the 18^(th) hole and rest assured, I’m not going to lay up...
