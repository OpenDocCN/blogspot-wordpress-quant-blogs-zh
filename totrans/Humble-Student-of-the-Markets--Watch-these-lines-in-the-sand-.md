# Humble Student of the Markets: Watch these lines in the sand!

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2013/06/watch-these-lines-in-sand.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2013/06/watch-these-lines-in-sand.html#0001-01-01)

The fact that the Fed telegraphed its decision to begin tapering QE later this year, assuming that the current trajectory of economic data holds, was not an enormous surprise to me. However, the combination of the Fed decision, bad China data overnight and a liquidity squeeze in China have served to exacerbate the global market selloffs as I write these words.

Is this just a minor correction or the start of something worse? These are some technical lines in the sand that I am watching. First of all, the decline in the SPX has been contained at its 50-day moving average in the recent past. Can support at the 50 dma, which is at about 1618 hold?

As well, bond yields have been spiking in the wake of the FOMC decision. Past surges in 10-year Treasury yields have been contained at about the 2.4% level. Can 2.4% hold?

**Bearish trigger in Europe**

I have also been relatively constructive on European equities and believe it to be a value play. Despite the negative tone on the markets, eurozone PMIs have surprised on the upside (via

[Business Insider](http://www.businessinsider.com/eurozone-june-2013-flash-pmi-2013-6)

):

I wrote that past declines in European equities have been contained at its 200 day moving average (see

[The bear case for equities](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2013/06/the-bear-case-for-equities.html)

). Can the 200 dma hold?

**Bearish trigger in emerging markets**

In China, the combination of poor June flash PMI and a liquidity crunch have served to throw the markets into a tizzy.

[Zero Hedge](http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-06-19/china-interbank-market-freezes-overnight-repo-explodes-25)

reports that overnight repo rates spiked to 25%, which is evocative of the market seizures seen during the Lehman Crisis.

At this point, we don't know if this credit crunch is deliberate or if the Chinese authorities have lost control of the interbank market (see

[FT Alphaville discussion](http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2013/06/20/1540852/is-it-policy-china-edition/)

).

[Michael McDonough](http://twitpic.com/cy4lpk)

sounded the alarm about the possible negative effects of this credit crunch on Chinese growth:

Should the Chinese credit crunch get out of control and start to spill over into the global markets, we should see the first signs of it in emerging market bonds. I wrote to watch the relative performance ratio of the emerging market bond ETF (EMB) against US high yield (HYG), which is testing a key relative technical support level (see

[An EM yellow flag](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2013/06/an-em-yellow-flag.html)

):

I had written in the past to watch the price of the Chinese banks listed in HK as warning signs (see

[The canaries in the Chinese coalmine](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2013/01/the-canaries-in-chinese-coalmine.html)

). That indicator may have lost some of its power as

[Reuters](http://in.reuters.com/article/2013/06/17/china-huijin-banks-idINL3N0ET2H320130617)

reported on Monday that the Chinese authorities have stepped in to increase their stake the state banks in order to "boost confidence":

> China's government has stepped up efforts to lift confidence in the country's flagging stock markets by buying more shares in the four biggest commercial banks, stock exchange statements showed on Monday.
> 
> Central Huijin Investment Co, which holds Beijing's investments in state-owned financial firms, spent about 363 million yuan ($59.2 million) buying bank shares on June 13, Reuters calculations based on stock exchange filings showed.
> 
> This is the third time Huijin has been known to be buying shares in the secondary market since June 13, when China's stock market skidded to six-month lows after data showed the world's second-biggest economy was cooling faster than expected.

**Watch the tripwires!**

In summary, I wrote on Monday that my Trend Model had moved to "neutral" from "risk-on" (see

[Is the correction over?](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2013/06/is-correction-over.html)

). For now, I am in watch and wait mode and monitoring these bearish tripwires before I go into full-flown "risk-off" mode:

*   Can the 50 dma hold for the SPX?
*   Can the 10-year Treasury yield breach the 2.4% level?
*   Can decline in the STOXX 600 be arrested at the 200 dma?
*   Will emerging market bonds melt down?
