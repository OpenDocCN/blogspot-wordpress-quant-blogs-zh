    Interesting follow up comments. The names mentioned as laid off are ecommerce/esales
    people. I know I’m hiring, but then I’m etrading software development, not marketing
    and sales. However, in my current hiring round I am seeing CVs from front office
    developers laid off in November and December 2007\. But I haven’t yet seen a CV
    from a rates etrading developer made redundant.'
