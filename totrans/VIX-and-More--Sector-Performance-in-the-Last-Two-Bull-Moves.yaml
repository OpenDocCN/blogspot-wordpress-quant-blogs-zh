    energy, over the past few days.  Included in most of my responses has been a comparison
    of the March to May bull move and the most recent move that came off of the July
    15^(th) bottom.  Since I rarely repost content from my [subscriber newsletter](http://vixandmoresubscriber.blogspot.com/),
    I thought it might be a good excuse to cut and a paste a section from Wednesday’s
    newsletter on sectors:'

    1440, a gain of 184 points.  As shown in the sector breakdown (top graph), there
    was strong sector participation across the board.  Interestingly enough, energy
    was the top performing sector, followed by technology and materials.  Financials
    fell in the middle of the pack.

    above the low.  This is not quite half the move of the March to May rally, but
    an impressive showing for a little more than one week of work.  Note how the sector
    breakdown looks quite different in the current rally (middle graph).  The extent
    to which financials have powered the recent move is impressive, if a little lopsided.  Note
    that only financials are the only sector to have made larger percentage gains
    in the current rally than in the March to May move.  In fact, besides financials,
    only the industrial and consumer discretionary sectors have made at least half
    of the gains from the earlier rally in the more recent rally.  All the other sectors
    have made gains of 3% or less, with energy and utilities showing losses.

- en: The bottom chart uses the same data as the middle chart, except that percentage
    gains and losses are net of the performance of the S&P 500 index.  This confirms
    that the financials are the only sector really responsible for moving the SPX.  The
    consumer discretionary sector has provided a small lift and the industrials are
    just narrowly beating the SPX, but without participation from financials, this
    rally would have a much different look and feel.
