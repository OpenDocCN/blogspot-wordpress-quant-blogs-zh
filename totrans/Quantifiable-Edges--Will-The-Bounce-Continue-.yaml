    are a few thoughts along with one test.

    Today’s move of 2.5% may or may not be enough. There isn’t convincing evidence
    either way based on the above mentioned test.

- en: The typical pattern has been a pullback followed by a continuation of the move.
    Of the 28 trades with a 3-day holding period, 23 of them traded below their entry-day
    close at some point over the next three days. So if you didn't get long yet, you'll
    likely have an opportunity in the next three days to pick up some index shares
    at lower prices if you like.

- en: I’ve shown a few other studies this week which showed a good chance for at least
    a strong multi-day rally. Currently I expect to see more upside over the next
    week or so. I’d be surprised if the market just rolled right over to new lows
    again this time.
