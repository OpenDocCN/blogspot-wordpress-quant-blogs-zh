    obsession with the U.S. [fiscal cliff](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/fiscal%20cliff)?
    Is it possible that very little has changed under the surface, but the decibels
    associated with this issue are now off the charts?

    respondents have rated the issues surrounding the U.S. fiscal cliff as their biggest
    source of fear about the future of the stock market. Now that the election is
    behind us and the earnings season is winding down, these fears have been buttressed
    by a huge amount of media scrutiny suddenly being devoted to the subject.

    months, but only recently have investors begun to pay attention to the problem.
    Part of the reason for this sudden interest in the fiscal cliff is that Congress
    and the Obama Administration were not going to address the fiscal cliff during
    the campaign season and consequently no one expected any progress on the fiscal
    cliff issues during this period. Now that the election is over, the issue is seen
    as a ticking time bomb, with a much shorter fuse each day.

    but I understand that the fiscal cliff issue is now dominating the business television
    airwaves as well.

    by substance and how much is driven by the media frenzy.

    data for “fiscal cliff” and discovered that the issue barely registered on Google’s
    radar until about May of this year.

- en: There was an occasional mention of the fiscal cliff up through last Sunday,
    then on Monday, the day before the U.S. election, new interest in the subject
    began to surface. The big spike in interest in the fiscal cliff happened on the
    day following the election, when Google search volume in “fiscal cliff” rose tenfold
    and the media frenzy began.

    (voting is still open) concerns about the ongoing [European sovereign debt crisis](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/European%20sovereign%20debt%20crisis)
    by the largest margin yet. The real question is whether this is due largely to
    a redirection of attention by the media and by investors or by changes in the
    underlying nature of the issue or the likelihood of a timely resolution to the
    problem. My guess is that more of the former is at work than the latter.
