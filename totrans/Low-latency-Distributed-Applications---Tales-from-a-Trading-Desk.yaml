    and Practice: Low-latency Distributed Applications in Finance‚Äù offers a good read
    on low latency in finance. ¬†RFQ‚Äôs and RFS are appropriately covered coupled with
    the often overlooked ‚Äú[Clock](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2745385) synchronization‚Äù

    made during the design of low latency architectures prior to them being implemented,
    and deployed into production, with sometimes unfortunate results.

- en: To achieve low-latency with minimal variance, while achieving high throughput,
    it is important to define a set of design principles that guide the development.
    When a trade off is required then the design principles help guide the decision
    in choosing between competing alternatives.
