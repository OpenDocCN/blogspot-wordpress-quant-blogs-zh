    not because our liberty and will have abandoned us, but because it is necessary
    to freely mind our free will and bind it with many ropes, ever since sin has been
    released. Those ropes are the laws. They teach us not only what we have to do,
    but also what we have to desire. We are bound to observe them all and implement
    them in our contracts, so that we do business not according to our desires and
    appetites, but according to what the laws show and order us to do. The law is
    the rule of our life through which we render our works measured and balanced*.’'
