- en: Many of the big exchanges like Gemini or Coinbase do not have lots of alt-coins,
    and if you don't have an account the process of creating one can take days if
    not weeks. They also can make it hard to place orders, as Gemini's default trade
    mode is incredibly infantile. Further, these exchanges put up significant hurdles
    for market makers, and the only thing that prevents collusive tactics is free
    entry. Regulators are happy to prevent competition if they can make sure they
    have control over who gets to trade what.  Nonetheless, when you can trade directly
    the markets are pretty tight for small size, under 0.1% bid-ask spread for trading
    1 bitcoin.

    which is very convenient. Thus I did not include ShapeShift, which regrettably,
    though understandably, yielded to regulatory authorities last year and requires
    a full KYC (regulators gave them no choice).

- en: I sent bitcoin amounts of between 0.3 and 1.0\. The costs were around 1.5% for
    the major shifters. While CoinSwitch does seem significantly better, around 1.05%,
    there was some significant variability, so this could just be sampling error around
    an equilibrium cost of 1.5%. Either way, you should expect to pay--all in--much
    more than the 0.5% often advertised. This really isn't so bad, because Gemini
    charges 1%, and it would be nice if one of these shifters actually said that their
    total cost is 1.5%, because it would signal honesty.

- en: Many post explicit fees, usually around 0.5%, but these are really a distraction
    because most of the money brokers make is not explicit. This often confuses people,
    as when E-Trade or some other broker tells customers they pay only 10$ a trade
    (or even zero) because most of the cost of trading is in the bid-ask spread. A
    broker either has specialists making markets off of their customer flow or has
    sold their flow to specialists making markets. In equity markets, while I was
    trading at a large hedge fund and analyzed over a billion USD in trades, I found
    the explicit fees were about 1/4 the cost of trading on small orders (those without
    market impact, ie, about the size of the top-of-the-book size).

  zh: 许多交易所公布的明确费用通常在0.5%左右，但这些实际上是一种干扰，因为经纪人赚钱的大部分并不是明确的。这常常让人困惑，因为当E-Trade或其他一些经纪人告诉客户他们每次交易只支付10美元（甚至零）时，因为交易的大部分成本在买卖价差中。一个经纪人要么有专家根据客户流向市场制定市场，要么已经将他们的客户流向出售给了专家进行市场制定。在股票市场上，当我在一个大型对冲基金进行交易并分析了超过10亿美元的交易时，我发现明确费用仅占交易成本的四分之一（那些没有市场冲击的小订单，即订单量与最优报价深度相当）。
- en: The only way to see how much an exchange charges is to compare the average execution
    price to the market price at the time of the order, as this combines the explicit
    and implicit fees. Once you send a coin to a coin shifter and it appears on the
    blockchain, the shifter can be confident it is getting that coin because the size
    of these orders is usually below 2 BTC, which is too small to be worth engineering
    a malicious double-spend. Thus, at that time the shifter can then make the offsetting
    market trade certain they are hedged, and so that is the time I use to benchmark
    my fills.

  zh: 唯一了解一个交易所收取多少费用的方法是比较平均执行价格和下单时的市场价格，因为这结合了明确和隐含的费用。一旦你将一枚硬币发送给一个硬币转换器，并且它出现在区块链上，转换器就可以确信它收到了那枚硬币，因为这些订单的规模通常低于2
    BTC，这对于进行恶意双花攻击来说太小而不值得开发。因此，在那个时候，转换器就可以进行对冲市场交易，确保它们进行了套期保值，这就是我用来对我的成交进行基准测试的时间。

    my trade, and I have checked in every couple of days to inquire about its status,
    and they keep telling me the servers are undergoing maintenance. It's been over
    two weeks [1 year!], and there's no message on their main page about this issue.

- en: n.exchange highlights the importance of trust on the blockchain. Though anonymity
    is an important crypto principle, reputation is still important. It is costly
    to learn whether someone is trustworthy, as invariably trades on the blockchain
    are not done via secure atomic swaps, but rather, you send bitcoin (etc), and
    hope they send something back. The process of learning if they are scammers takes
    a lot of time, and occasionally you lose all your money.

  zh: n.exchange强调了在区块链上的信任的重要性。虽然匿名是一个重要的加密原则，但声誉仍然很重要。了解某人是否值得信任的代价很高，因为在区块链上进行的交易通常不是通过安全的原子互换来完成的，而是你发送比特币（等等），然后希望他们回送一些东西。了解他们是否欺诈的过程需要很长时间，并且偶尔你会失去所有的钱。
