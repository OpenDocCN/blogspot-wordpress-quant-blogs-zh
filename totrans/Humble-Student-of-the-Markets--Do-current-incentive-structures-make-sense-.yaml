    the rules to get things done against the odds. He succeeded and became the captain
    of the ship. Playing against Kirk, we have the character of Spock, the logical
    and reasoned thinker (who will never become the captain of a starship). The Kirk
    hero archetype is a common feature in many Hollywood films and a common characteristic
    of heroes in American popular culture.

    bonuses, does Kirk sound like the star producer and Spock is the risk manager?

    taking risks. Among the reasons why Bill Gates dropped out of university and started
    Microsoft and made billions when you know you're the same age as he is and you
    know he's not really that smart and Windows sucks and you can't stand the guy,
    is that he took a risk and you didn't. Elevating uber-conservatism into the highest
    virtue is no path to growth and wealth and all good things capitalism.

    very top levels of banks. Reviewing the publicly available lists of board members
    at many firms, I observe that most of them not only have never taken an active
    role in trading, analysis or risk management, but that today few would even be
    accepted as a trainee in a less prestigious organisation than they ran into the
    ground. ***In effect we had mediocre cavalry officers in charge of nuclear bombers.***
