    unit next month with about half a dozen people, according to a person with knowledge
    of the matter. The team will report to David Ferrucci, who joined Bridgewater
    at the end of 2012 after leading the International Business Machines Corp. engineers
    that developed Watson, the computer that beat human players on the television
    quiz show “Jeopardy!”

    data and statistical probabilities, said the person, who asked not to be identified
    because the information is private. The programs will learn as markets change
    and adapt to new information, as opposed to those that follow static instructions.
    A spokeswoman for Westport, Connecticut-based Bridgewater declined to comment
    on the team.

    is unlikely to unleash an army of Terminator-like robots that relentlessly seek
    out alpha in the investment business.

    that they are notoriously difficult to debug. When something goes haywire, it
    becomes virtually impossible to walk back the steps that led to the misstep. Was
    the bad decision a bug, or a feature? It is very difficult to tell.

    a investment process where you have no idea of what is going on, other than the
    fact that it is a black box. That is why AI systems are unlikely to be in widespread
    use - few institutional sponsors will trust them. In the absence of widespread
    adoption, we are unlikely to see a future army of AI-bots rooting out alpha.

- en: 'Chaos theory is a field of study in mathematics, with applications in several
    disciplines including meteorology, sociology, physics, engineering, economics,
    biology, and philosophy. Chaos theory studies the behavior of dynamical systems
    that are highly sensitive to initial conditions—a response popularly referred
    to as the butterfly effect. Small differences in initial conditions (such as those
    due to rounding errors in numerical computation) yield widely diverging outcomes
    for such dynamical systems, rendering long-term prediction impossible in general.
    This happens even though these systems are deterministic, meaning that their future
    behavior is fully determined by their initial conditions, with no random elements
    involved In other words, the deterministic nature of these systems does not make
    them predictable. This behavior is known as deterministic chaos, or simply chaos.
    The theory was summarized by Edward Lorenz as follows:'

    condition dependent. In one moment, a butterfly flapping its wings could conceivably
    cause weather havoc on the other side of the world, but in another, nothing would
    happen.

    Theory, which is a charting technique known well to technical analysts. The interpretation
    of a chart can be highly dependent on how the analyst begins his wave count and
    different starting points can lead to very different conclusions (one reason why
    I've never understood EW very well).

    firm in Boston and their firm had done extensive work in non-linear systems. They
    had some success with it, but abandoned it after discovering that the risk-adjusted
    alpha that it generated was roughly in line with traditional linear factors such
    as the value, growth and momentum. These systems were just too difficult to control
    and diagnose, especially if investment results turned negative.
