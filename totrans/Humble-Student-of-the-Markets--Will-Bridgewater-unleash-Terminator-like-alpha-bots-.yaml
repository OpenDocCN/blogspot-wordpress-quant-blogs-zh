- en: 'Chaos theory is a field of study in mathematics, with applications in several
    disciplines including meteorology, sociology, physics, engineering, economics,
    biology, and philosophy. Chaos theory studies the behavior of dynamical systems
    that are highly sensitive to initial conditions—a response popularly referred
    to as the butterfly effect. Small differences in initial conditions (such as those
    due to rounding errors in numerical computation) yield widely diverging outcomes
    for such dynamical systems, rendering long-term prediction impossible in general.
    This happens even though these systems are deterministic, meaning that their future
    behavior is fully determined by their initial conditions, with no random elements
    involved In other words, the deterministic nature of these systems does not make
    them predictable. This behavior is known as deterministic chaos, or simply chaos.
    The theory was summarized by Edward Lorenz as follows:'

  zh: 混沌理论是数学领域的一个研究课题，应用领域包括气象学、社会学、物理学、工程学、经济学、生物学和哲学。混沌理论研究的是对初始条件高度敏感的动力系统的行为——这种反应通常被称为蝴蝶效应。初始条件的小差异（如数值计算中的舍入误差）导致这类动力系统的结果大相径庭，使得长期预测在一般情况下不可能。即使这些系统是确定性的，意味着它们的未来行为完全由初始条件决定，没有随机元素参与，换句话说，这些系统的确定性性质并不意味着它们是可预测的。这种行为被称为确定性混沌，或简称混沌。爱德华·洛伦兹总结了理论如下：

    firm in Boston and their firm had done extensive work in non-linear systems. They
    had some success with it, but abandoned it after discovering that the risk-adjusted
    alpha that it generated was roughly in line with traditional linear factors such
    as the value, growth and momentum. These systems were just too difficult to control
