    Returns varied, solely by chance...I''ll spare you the calculus, but according
    to Fargione''s model, by the "inexorable effect of chance," and chance alone,
    "a small proportion of entrepreneurs come to possess essentially all of the wealth...According
    to Fargione, greater variation in rates of return hastened the concentration of
    wealth.'

    randomly, and found the net inequality will be due to randomness. I understand
    that assumptions drive models, but the step between assumption and result has
    to be a little subtle or non-obvious. Here, he assumed everyone varied by randomness,
    and after doing this in Excel (really), it implied variation by chance is really
    random.

    are making an important assumption about navigating one's life. Success is the
    result of randomness, effort, and ability. If you omit one of these, you will
    be miserable. A lot of growing up is about finding what you like that you are
    good at, and usually you like things you are relatively good at. Then practice
    that skill until you become excellent at it. The rest you can't really worry about
    even though that too is important, especially in explaining things like why certain

    For the existentialists Kierkegaard and Heidegger, this anxiety is the essence

    while I tend to find Heidegger's solution more fruitful, it clearly has more potential
    downside (Kierkegaard chose faith in God, Heidegger became an enthusiastic Nazi).

    effort or all luck. In any case, this is a more damaging belief for their own
    self-actualization than any silly tax policy they envisage.
