    of controls put into place. In the next cycle, excesses popped up elsewhere. That’s
    because of the asymmetric nature of risk. Risk managers have are burdened with
    short option position phenomena in risk control: limited upside and unlimited
    downside. On the other hand, revenue producers (whether in a hedge fund, broker,
    or other financial services entity) have the reverse position of being long a
    call option. These people get handsomely rewarded by making money for their firm
    and for themselves through financial engineering, but they face limited downside
    risk if the structure they build all comes apart at some point in the future.'
