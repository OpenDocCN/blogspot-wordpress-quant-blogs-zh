- en: The main event last week for US investors was the FOMC decision. As expected,
    the Fed raised rates by a quarter-point and underlined that "ongoing increases
    in the target range will be appropriate". Powell went on to clarify that "ongoing
    increases" translated to a "couple" of rate hikes, which would put the terminal
    rate at 5.00% to 5.25%, a level that was just above market expectations. He went
    on to signal that the Fed does not expect to cut rates this year. Moreover, he
    stressed, "We will stay the course until the job is done".

  zh: 上周对美国投资者来说的主要事件是FOMC的决定。如预期所料，美联储将利率提高了四分之一个百分点，并强调“目标范围的持续增加将是适当的”。鲍威尔继续澄清，“持续增加”意味着“几次”加息，这将使最终利率达到5.00%至5.25%，这一水平略高于市场预期。他接着暗示美联储不预计今年会降息。此外，他强调，“我们将坚持到底，直到任务完成”。
- en: Those statements appeared hawkish, until he allowed, "We can now say for the
    first time that the disinflationary process has started". In addition, he characterized
    financial conditions as tight when it was obvious that markets had been taking
    on a risk-on tone since October.

  zh: 那些声明听起来很鹰派，直到他承认，“我们现在可以首次确认通缩过程已经开始”。此外，当市场自10月以来已经呈现出冒险情绪时，他还把金融状况描述为紧张。
- en: As a consequence, the Fed's hawkish warnings fell on deaf ears. Asset prices
    went into a risk-on mode in response to Powell's statements during the press conference.
    The market consensus terminal rate stayed at just below 5% and expectations of
    rate cuts at the end of 2023 changed from one to two. It took a strong surprise
    from the January Jobs Report to push the terminal rate above 5%, though easing
    expectations was pushed forward into mid-year.

  zh: 因此，美联储的鹰派警告被置若罔闻。在鲍威尔在新闻发布会上发表声明后，资产价格进入了冒险模式。市场共识的最终利率保持在略低于5%，对2023年底降息的预期从一次变为两次。尽管1月就业报告的强劲惊喜将最终利率推高至5%以上，但缓解预期的举措被推迟到年中。-->
