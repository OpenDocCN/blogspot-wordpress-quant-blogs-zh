Random thoughts ....

I have always wondered if there is any correlation between the coffee service that a company provides to the IT staff and the perceived quality of the company.

Barclays had the best coffee service. Being a British bank, it paid a lot of attention to the variety of teas it made available. It also had one of those big machines that made cappucino, expresso, or hot chocolate. I was at that machine five times a day.

BusinessEdge and Morgan Stanley have the little cups of Flavia coffee and hot chocolate ... totally free.

Wachovia in Charlotte ... never tried their coffee service ...in Charlotte, there are three Starbucks in every office building ... I never saw so many Starbucks per square meter.

My current company has free Martinson's coffee, but charges 50 or 75 cents for Flavia. After years of drinking Starbucks, Martinson's seems very bitter and flavorless. I guess that I am too used to Starbucks.

Do you bring in your own coffee machine? Watch it... many companies are cracking down on that practice.

How does your company's coffee culture stack up?
