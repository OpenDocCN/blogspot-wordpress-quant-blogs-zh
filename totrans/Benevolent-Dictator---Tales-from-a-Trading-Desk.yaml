    to make decisions, and move forwards.  This decision process, leads to an interesting
    article [titled](http://www.itbusinessedge.com/cm/blogs/tennant/the-argument-for-benevolent-dictatorship-in-decision-making/?cs=48212)
    “The Argument for ‘Benevolent Dictatorship’ in Decision-making”.  Personally,
    I can relate to the seven tips in the article, as I am sure a few others (readers?)
    can 😉  Tip 4 should possible be a rule 😉  The last of the 7 tips probably should
    be though about in the context of “vision” – see earlier blog posting.

    deliver today due to in part, the lack of understanding a vision, and the understanding

- en: (Benevolent dictators) also show a readiness to act decisively even in desperate
    situations knowing the buck stops with them. This only works if a leader is respected.
    Respect doesn’t happen overnight but is built over time by proving personal capability
    and commitment. It doesn’t automatically come with a job title, nor should it.
