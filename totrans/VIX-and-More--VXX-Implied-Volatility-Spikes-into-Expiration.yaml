    expiring on Wednesday and [VXX options](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX%20options)
    expiring today (technically tomorrow) in the normal monthly expiration cycle,
    this is a big week for volatility traders who are comfortable holding options
    positions into expiration.

    is the manner in which time and volatility can sometimes become distorted, presenting
    some interesting trading opportunities.

- en: Looking at the implied volatility of [VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX)
    this week, one can see that August IV (red line) was tracking in a fairly tight
    range of 60-70 from Monday through Wednesday. Yesterday saw a little more noise
    and some IV spikes into the upper 70s. Today there has been a quantum change in
    implied volatility, with VXX IV shooting up over 120 and gyrating wildly throughout
    the session, as the chart below shows. Interestingly, the underlying VXX ETF has
    not been particularly volatile today. I attribute much of the erratic change in
    implied volatility to the approach of options expiration.

    expiration, in my opinion these newfangled products are just the place where retail
    traders are more likely to be able to find an edge than some of the better-known
    institutional warhorses.
