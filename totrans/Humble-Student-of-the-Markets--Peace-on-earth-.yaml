    significant risks. But going to war to impede Iran’s nuclear ambitions, and containing
    the subsequent chaos – including oil-price spikes, increased regional volatility,
    and reduced American strategic flexibility – would be far more costly. If Obama
    stands behind his first-term declarations, the world will pay a very high price.

    which today is about 7% of its GDP, just a fifth of its mid-1970s levels but still
    painfully burdensome. In contrast, the U.S., despite its military presence around
    the globe, spends less than 5% of its GDP on the military; countries with peaceable
    neighbours such as Denmark, Sweden and Canada typically spend 1.5% or less.

    state, Palestinians would no longer have an entitlement to Israeli aid and with
    the high-profile Israeli-Palestinian issue defused, Arab oil states that have
    reluctantly provided aid in solidarity against Israel would be able to bow out.
    More importantly, with the end of unrest Palestine would soon lose the raison
    d’être for international aid from Western countries and agencies such as the World
    Bank — the belief that the West could leverage its aid to end conflict and arrive
    at a peace treaty. Foreign aid diplomacy, in fact, has driven the peace process
    since Bill Clinton in 1993 brought together PLO chairman Yasser Arafat and Israeli
    prime minister Yitzhak Rabin to sign what is known as the Oslo Accord.

    — to them peace looks more like a punitive tax. Not surprisingly, while public
    opinion polls show Israelis to overwhelmingly favour a two-state solution in which
    Israel and an independent Palestine live side by side, they also show Palestinians
    in the Palestinian territories to overwhelmingly oppose it.

    this year, the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research surveyed Palestinians
    on how the government should meet a budget shortfall for this year. Only 9% backed
    tax increases while “a majority of 52% selected the option of returning to negotiations
    with Israel in order to obtain greater international financial support.”
