- en: The Application Tap solves the challenge of minimally invasive software instrumentation
    by providing a user mode API that enables software events within applications
    to be instrumented with minimal overhead. The Application Tap API is integrated
    with custom developed firmware running on a state of the art FPGA co-processor
    using OS kernel by-pass techniques. Instrumentation code added to applications
    is able to pass instrumentation metadata to the Application Tap which time stamps
    events to 10ns resolution, and forwards the instrumentation metadata to an external
    monitoring appliance, such as TipOff^®, using an on-board gigabit network interface.
