- en: One of my strategies uses a ML technique to find patterns in the distribution
    of returns across a portfolio.  Conditioned on the pattern is a highly skewed
    marginal distribution for next period returns.   The + skew is important and a
    very good thing, pointing to much more + returns than negative returns.

    serial correlation in the bigger winners.   If true would allow further amplification
    of winners or better selection within.   Indeed it did work out that more negative
    serial correlation produced higher next period returns on average.

    returns.  Was easy to visualize / examine with the **rgl** package in R:'

    I can’t go into the background of what this is conditional on.   Thought I’d give
    a plug for rgl and also note that autocorrelation can be a useful tool in predicting
    return bias.
