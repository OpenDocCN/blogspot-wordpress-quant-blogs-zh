    to rise. Stock prices had become severely oversold Wednesday and undergone a successful
    test of its 200 dma. None of the RSI momentum indicators are overbought and the
    VIX Index was slightly above mid Bollinger Band, or 20 dma.

- en: confirm my views. This chart of stocks above their 50 dma show that the indicator
    has been experiencing an uptrend of higher lows and higher highs, just like the
    SPX. The lows seen in late June and early July may have represented an oversold
    condition where breadth could seen a bounce, with potential to rise to the target
    zone shown.

- en: This chart of net 52-week highs vs. lows tell a similar story. Breadth is improving
    and readings re not overbought. They could advance, at the very least, to the
    first target, with the potential to rise further to the higher target zone, which
    would likely represent SPX new all-time-highs.

- en: My inner investor remains roughly at investment policy target weight on his
    asset allocation. My inner trader is long equities in anticipation of an oversold
    rally that is likely to test the old highs and possibly make new highs in the
    weeks to come. Undoubtedly the ride will be bumpy, but hopefully we won`t get
    a Groundhog Day repeat next week where the market declines to test the lows again.

  zh: 我的内在投资者在资产配置上大致保持了投资政策目标权重。我的内在交易员看涨股票，预期在超卖后的反弹可能会测试前期高点，并可能在接下来的几周内创下新高。毫无疑问，这将会是一段颠簸的旅程，但希望我们不会在下周一再经历像土拨鼠日那样的市场下跌，再次测试低点。
