    As a reminder of what was happening then, the SPX had peaked in October, 2007
    and was already in decline. March 20, 2008 represented a sentiment extreme and
    the market proceeded to rally by 10.8% in the next two months and the rally was
    halted at the downtrend line. The market then fell into its Lehman Crisis low
    later that year.

- en: While this is not a forecast, an equivalent gain today would take SPX up to
    2307\. Even if it were to fall short of 2300 and reach, say 2200, such s rally
    would likely flip market sentiment from excessively bearish to wildly bullish
    - which would set up the conditions for the intermediate term top that I had been
    postulating.
