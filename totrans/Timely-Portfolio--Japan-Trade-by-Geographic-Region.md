# Timely Portfolio: Japan Trade by Geographic Region

> 来源：[http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2012/03/japan-trade-by-geographic-region.html#0001-01-01](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2012/03/japan-trade-by-geographic-region.html#0001-01-01)

To further the analysis presented in [Japanese Trade and the Yen](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2012/03/japanese-trade-and-yen.html), I thought I would take the more granular data provided by the Japanese Ministry of Finance on trade by geographic region.  Of course, I will use R to read, analyze, and plot the .csv data.  Below you will see there are only two remaining regions where Japan has a trade surplus (North and South America), and those surpluses are declining very rapidly.
