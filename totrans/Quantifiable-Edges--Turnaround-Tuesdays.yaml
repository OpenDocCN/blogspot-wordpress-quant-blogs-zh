- en: Many traders have heard the term “Turnaround Tuesday”. And with the market a
    bit short-term oversold after the selloff the last few days many traders are also
    hoping we see a Turnaround Tuesday. But are they just a myth? I recently put them
    to the test.

    below I show all the days of the week. The day listed is the trigger day – not
    the performance day. In other words, if Monday was the 1st down day then the S&P
    would be bought at the close and sold at Tuesday’s close. So the Monday trigger
    tracks Tuesday’s performance. Tuesday’s trigger tracks Wednesday’s performance…and
    so on.

    the week.

    a little better.

    are even better recently than if you look back 58 years. It appears Turnaround
    Tuesdays are real…and they’re not just for old folks.
