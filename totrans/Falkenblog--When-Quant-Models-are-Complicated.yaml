    the models they have to implement. They will complain about instability of the
    Heston volatility model for example. I will explain to them why it is unstable,
    why they shouldn't be using it, what they can do that's better and they will respond
    along the lines of "I agree, but I don't have any choice in the matter." Senior
    quants are clearly insisting on implementations that those on the front line know
    are unworkable.

    calling the 'Measure Theory Police.' These 'Police' write papers filled with jargon,
    taking 30 pages to do what proper mathematicians could do in four pages. They
    won’t listen to commonsense unless it starts with 'Theorem,' contains a 'Proof,'
    and ends with a 'QED.' I'll write in detail about the Measure Theory Police at
    a later date, but in the meantime will all those people complaining to me about

- en: In my experience as a risk manager any model that most people don't understand
    is not used for its stated purpose. Thus, most Asset and Liability committees
    that make decisions about interest rate risk--what duration to take--use simple,
    arbitrary (eg, 100 basis point) parallel shifts in interest rates, perhaps a twist.
    A bank might have a quant working on a Heath-Jarrow-Morton type model, usually
    put out there as a distraction for outsiders such as rating agency representatives,
    equity analysts, or regulators, lame attempts impress these outsiders as if such
    high-tech methods are part of the institutional alpha. Creators of complex models
    that their colleagues do not understand should know they are being patronized,
    used as tools, and should find a job where either their complex models are appreciated
    or simplify their models so that their work is actually used.

  zh: 在我作为风险经理的经验中，大多数人不理解的模型都不会因其所声称的目的而使用。因此，大多数资产和负债委员会在做出关于利率风险的决策时──持续多久才会采取行动──使用简单、武断（例如，100个基点）的利率平行变化，可能有一些扭曲。一个银行可以让一名量化分析员工作在类似Heath-Jarrow-Morton模型的模型上，通常是为了分散外部人员的注意，例如评级机构代表、股票分析师或监管机构，无聊的尝试向这些人表明高科技方法是机构阿尔法的一部分似的。那些同事不理解其复杂模型的创作者应该知道他们是受到了怀疑，被作为工具，应该寻找一份在那里他们的复杂模型得到赞赏的工作，或者简化他们的模型，让他们的工作真正被使用。
- en: Thus, the situation described by Paul here seems to me to be a case of some
    quants who work for someone who is either too stupid to realize they are props,
    or don't care and simply enjoy their role for what it is. 'Theorems' and 'proofs'
    may impress referees at academic journals, but unless you work for Bell Labs,
    this means you are working on things real decision makers do not use directly.
    Thus, trying to convince such people that they should not use a Heston model,
    but rather a simpler model, like GARCH, or even an exponentially weighted volatility,
    is all well and fine, but given their revealed preference for complex, unstable
    models, there is probably no appetite for

  zh: 不管这个团队出了什么结果，实际上只是为了混淆视听。将事情简化，以便使这样的工作变得有用，可能违反了组织中暗中达成的共识，即量化分析师应该创造非常复杂的模型，仅仅是为了给外行留下深刻的印象。然而，一个人不应该直接向任何人提出或讨论'有用性问题'，就像一个人在联合方式募捐活动中举起手说'如果公司只是试图用我们的捐款购买公司公关，那我们的工资应该得到调整吗？'。在这样的环境中获得成功，必须了解所处的游戏。
- en: The only times I have seen complicated models used is when both the quant and
    his boss understand what he is doing. If only the modeler understands his model,
    and even he thinks it is unstable, you can be sure his work is a pretext. These
    are great jobs in only one sense--you can work on your next job for most of the
    day. They are dead ends, because there is an infinite supply of super educated
    quants who are clueless as to practicalities and office politics. They are also
    obvious candidates for layoffs in tough economic times.

  zh: 我唯一看到复杂模型被使用的场合是，当量化分析师和他的老板都了解他在做什么。如果只有建模者了解他的模型，甚至他自己也认为它不稳定，你可以肯定他的工作是以借口为名。这些工作在某种意义上是伟大的——你可以大部分时间用于寻找自己的下一份工作。它们是死胡同，因为有无穷无尽的受过高等教育但对实际情况和办公室政治一窍不通的量化分析师供应。在经济不景气时期，他们也是裁员的明显候选人。
