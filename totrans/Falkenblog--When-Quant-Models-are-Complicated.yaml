    the models they have to implement. They will complain about instability of the
    Heston volatility model for example. I will explain to them why it is unstable,
    why they shouldn't be using it, what they can do that's better and they will respond
    along the lines of "I agree, but I don't have any choice in the matter." Senior
    quants are clearly insisting on implementations that those on the front line know
    are unworkable.

    calling the 'Measure Theory Police.' These 'Police' write papers filled with jargon,
    taking 30 pages to do what proper mathematicians could do in four pages. They
    won’t listen to commonsense unless it starts with 'Theorem,' contains a 'Proof,'
    and ends with a 'QED.' I'll write in detail about the Measure Theory Police at
    a later date, but in the meantime will all those people complaining to me about
    them please speak up...you are preaching to the converted, go spread the word!

    is not used for its stated purpose. Thus, most Asset and Liability committees
    that make decisions about interest rate risk--what duration to take--use simple,
    arbitrary (eg, 100 basis point) parallel shifts in interest rates, perhaps a twist.
    A bank might have a quant working on a Heath-Jarrow-Morton type model, usually
    put out there as a distraction for outsiders such as rating agency representatives,
    equity analysts, or regulators, lame attempts impress these outsiders as if such
    high-tech methods are part of the institutional alpha. Creators of complex models
    that their colleagues do not understand should know they are being patronized,
    used as tools, and should find a job where either their complex models are appreciated
    or simplify their models so that their work is actually used.

    quants who work for someone who is either too stupid to realize they are props,
    or don't care and simply enjoy their role for what it is. 'Theorems' and 'proofs'
    may impress referees at academic journals, but unless you work for Bell Labs,
    this means you are working on things real decision makers do not use directly.
    Thus, trying to convince such people that they should not use a Heston model,
    but rather a simpler model, like GARCH, or even an exponentially weighted volatility,
    is all well and fine, but given their revealed preference for complex, unstable
    models, there is probably no appetite for

    things down so that such work will be useful might violate the unspoken understanding
    in the organization where the quants are supposed to create really complicated
    models merely to impress obtuse outsiders. One should not mention or discuss the
    'usefulness problem' directly with anyone, however, just as one does not raise
    their hand in the United Way drive to say 'if the company is just trying to buy
    corporate PR with our donations, shouldn't our salaries be adjusted for this?'.
    To prosper in such an environment one must understand the game being played.

    his boss understand what he is doing. If only the modeler understands his model,
    and even he thinks it is unstable, you can be sure his work is a pretext. These
    are great jobs in only one sense--you can work on your next job for most of the
    day. They are dead ends, because there is an infinite supply of super educated
    quants who are clueless as to practicalities and office politics. They are also
    obvious candidates for layoffs in tough economic times.
