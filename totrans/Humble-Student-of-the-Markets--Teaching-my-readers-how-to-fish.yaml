    I write is appropriate for you? I was asked recently why I don't post my portfolios
    and their performance. While posting my trades represent a disclosure of any possible
    conflicts in my writing, my own portfolios are a function of my own cash flow
    needs, my return objectives, my own pain thresholds, etc. How could any portfolio
    that I post be appropriate to anyone else? Your mileage will vary.

    stocks and both my investment account (inner investor) and trading account (inner

    and pain threshold. Subsequent market action indicates that my inner trader got
    faked out and the market rallied. In that case, it appears that my inner trader
    was wrong by getting stopped out of his position, while my inner investor was
    right.

    on either of mine by blindly following my trades means adopting my investment

    market. He isn't always right, but he has been more right than wrong. His portfolio
    turnover averages 200% per month, which is not appropriate for everyone.

    The time horizon is longer. Turnover is much lower, but drawdown risk and pain
    threshold is higher.
