    Barton Biggs, Laurence Summers, Jean-Claude Trichet, and others. Then I find it
    was praised by about 50 of these types of guys, as if Davos had a session on writing
    blurbs for David Smick. See the quotes

    how we are all interconnected, and the Chinese are going to have a lot of investing
    power, the market has been fluctuating a lot recently, financial instruments are
    complicated (things called 'collateralized debt obligations'). Most importantly,
    though Thomas Friedman's book the World is Flat is GREAT, he says, the world is
    actually

    Lastly, the author talks to all sorts of smart, powerful people ("Friend of mine
    at the Fed say...").

    just mentions current trends

    an appreciation that this collection of observations has a point, other than,
    the world is complicated, and though it may get better, it may get worse. Like
    many of these types of books, he seems to think he clarifies things by mentioning
    lots of varied facts, or some banal observations are really profound (eg, capital
    flows: important). He did not get to his point in the two first chapters of his
    book, perhaps its at the end (''plastics'', or something).'

    I can't imagine these people read the book and felt the way they did. Did Lawrence
    Summers really say "He writes in a way that makes giving close attention a pleasure."?
    Did Stan Druckemiller really write "It's a 'must read'"? If you think stock analysts
    were in cahoots with the investment banks, then the book blurbing industry is
    that situation raised to the google power. And if this is a 'must read' according
    to the Davos crowd, it clearly highlights the champagne was flowing, and its scary
    to think these guys are making the key decisions at the Fed, White House, etc.
