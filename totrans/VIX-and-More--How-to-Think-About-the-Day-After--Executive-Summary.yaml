- en: the second most common VIX spike pattern is one of 3-5 days in duration before
    it starts to subside (note that the VIX had already jumped about 10% in the two
    days prior to today's 64% spike, which might make it even more susceptible to
    a retracement as early as tomorrow)

    high chance of heralding an extended period of much higher volatility

    original spike

    to the mean (i.e., 10 and 20 day SMA) after a 3-5 day spike

- en: their prices are a function of VIX futures prices, not the underlying VIX prices
    -- so often the VIX moves a substantial amount in the direction you want, but
    the call or put moves a lot less or in the opposite direction because the futures
    expectations change much more slowly than the ‘spot’ VIX price
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: implied volatility in the VIX tends to be extremely high even in relatively
    placid markets, so swimming upstream faster than time decay can often be harder
    than it appears

- en: if you must play VIX options, consider hedging your bets with some [bear call
    spreads](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/02/waiting-for-godot.html) instead
    of or in addition to buying some puts outright
