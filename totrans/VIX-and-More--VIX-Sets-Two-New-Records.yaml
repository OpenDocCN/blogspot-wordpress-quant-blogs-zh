- en: It is not every day that the VIX establishes some sort of new all-time record
    and it is rarer still that the volatility index sets two different records on
    consecutive days, but such has been the case at the beginning of this week.

- en: The first record, established on Monday, was in the [VIX:VXV ratio](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%3AVXV)
    – a subject that I covered on a regular basis in the first year or so following
    the launch of [VXV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXV), which is
    essentially a *93 day* version of the VIX and whose formal name is the CBOE S&P
    500 3-Month Volatility Index.

    the VIX:VXV ratio performed flawlessly (see [VXV Is One Year Old](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/11/vxv-is-one-year-old.html).)
    In a post-Lehman world, however, the VIX:VXV ratio has been inconsistent as the
    persistent extreme [contango](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/contango)
    has made the ratio more difficult to calibrate. I have been doing some work on
    this, however, and will share some of my thinking about how to tweak this ratio
    going forward.

    Index](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20Futures%20Contango%20Index).
    I spelled out some of my thinking about the epic disconnect between the cash/spot
    VIX and the [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures)
    in a post a month ago with the title of [VIX Futures: What Are/Were They Thinking?](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/09/vix-futures-what-wereare-they-thinking.html)'

- en: 'In the end, the VIX:VXV ratio and the VIX Futures Contango Index both measure
    different aspects of the same phenomenon: how much current volatility readings
    vary from future market volatility estimates. I do believe that when estimates
    of near-term and long-term volatility show a record degree of divergence, some
    considerable opportunities are presented. As I have spelled out in a number of
    instances lately, my thinking has been that the back month volatility will likely
    collapse in order to bring the present and the future back into line. There has
    been some evidence of that happening during the past two days, but I anticipate
    that long-term volatility expectations will continue to decline.'
