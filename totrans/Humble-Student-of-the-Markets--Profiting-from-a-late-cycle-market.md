# Humble Student of the Markets: Profiting from a late cycle market

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2015/11/profiting-from-late-cycle-market.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2015/11/profiting-from-late-cycle-market.html#0001-01-01)

Despite these negative signals from the bond and credit markets, I am not ready to hit the panic button yet, as there is no sign of a recession on the horizon. I am grateful to New Deal democrat for his long leading indicator framework, which he adapted from Geoffrey Moore (see his post where he outlines his methodology 

). New Deal democrat monitors seven long leading indicators and only one is negative:

My interpretation of current conditions indicate risks are rising but we are in no imminent danger of an economic downturn. Instead, the US economy is entering the late cycle phase of the economic expansion.

Is asset inflation dead, or are commodities a contrarian buy? I believe that this is setting up to be a classic contrarian value play, which can be defined as putting on a position that makes you distinctly uncomfortable. This value investment theme was reinforced by the news that billionaire and deep value investor

.

An inflection point for inflation and hard assets may be just around the corner. Goldman Sachs warned that the market is underestimating future inflation (via

[Bloomberg](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-12/goldman-to-bond-traders-you-re-underestimating-u-s-inflation)

):

> "The market is way too bearish on U.S. inflation in the medium term," meaning between five and 10 years, said Silvia Ardagna, an analyst in London with Goldman Sachs, one of the 22 primary dealers that trade with the Fed.
> 
> A rebound in the bond market’s inflation view would signal rising investor confidence in the Fed’s ability to increase interest rates without derailing the economy. Stronger-than-forecast U.S. jobs data on Nov. 6 backed up the case for the central bank to boost its benchmark rate from near zero at its meeting next month.
> 
> A turnaround in the inflation measure could happen quickly because the gauge is so low compared with where the bank assesses fair value -- a statistically rare two standard deviations away -- according to Ardagna.
> 
> "When an asset class in our space is this misvalued relative to its fair level estimated with our model, usually a reversal tends to be pretty fast," she said.
> 
> The 10-year break-even rate hasn’t traded at 2 percent since October 2014, when crude oil was above $90 a barrel, compared with about $42 Thursday. Investors should exit the trade if the break-even closes below 1.4 percent, according to the bank.

Is inflation truly dead? The Atlanta Fed's

[labor market spider chart](https://www.frbatlanta.org/chcs/labormarket.aspx?d=1&s=tw)

shows steady improvement on all dimensions, indicating imminent wage and cost-post pressures.

[Benn Steil](http://blogs.cfr.org/geographics/2015/11/12/globalliquidity/)

pointed out that despite the Fed's tightening tilt, global central banks are still adding aggregate liquidity to their balance sheets:

Commodities are becoming a crowded short. Meb Faber recently rhetorically asked 

[Why You Should Ask For Coal (Stocks) In Your Stockings This Holiday Season](http://mebfaber.com/2015/11/11/why-you-should-ask-for-coal-stocks-in-your-stockings-this-holidiy-season/)

 because of how washed out they are.

[Bloomberg](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-09/gold-assets-in-world-s-biggest-etp-fall-to-lowest-since-2008)

reported that GLD assets are hitting 2008 levels:

From a chartist's viewpoint, the relative performance of late cycle sectors is becoming more constructive. This 20-year relative performance chart of energy stocks to the SPX show that energy is testing a relative support zone with signs of positive RSI divergence.

I am also seeing a similar pattern of positive divergence on the relative performance of gold stocks as they test relative support.

This chart of the spread of PPI to CPI (blue line) shows that it is at levels where it has historically rebounded. The green line depicts the YoY change in the important industrial commodity complex, copper and copper products, which is poised to rise.

[Tom McClellan](http://www.mcoscillator.com/learning_center/weekly_chart/copper_priced_in_japanese_yen/)

identified a 10 month cycle in copper prices (ht

[Jeff Miller](http://dashofinsight.com/weighing-the-week-ahead-what-is-the-message-from-falling-commodity-prices/)

), indicating that the red metal may be nearing an inflection point:

McClellan did warn, however, that copper typically bottoms with a capitulation sell-off that we haven't seen yet:

> The 10 month cycle in copper price bottoms says that a bottom is due imminently. But we are not yet seeing a big negative reading on the ROC to say that we have seen a washout selloff. When that washout eventually comes, there will likely be some big geopolitical or economic news to justify the selloff, and to help facilitate the washout selling wave. So when you hear that the sky is falling in the copper market, that will be the signal that the bottom is almost at hand.

When I put it all together, these late cycle sectors are getting ready to rocket upwards based on the combination of extreme negative sentiment and the benefit of an unexpected macro tailwind (also see this bullish commodity comment developed independently from

[Market Anthropology](http://www.marketanthropology.com/2015/11/connecting-dots-111315.html)

). Should the Fed raise rates in December, analysis from Barclays show that energy, materials and capital goods sectors, along with selected financial stocks that benefit from higher rates, tend to outperform (via

[Bloomberg](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-12/barclays-we-re-about-to-enter-a-new-stock-market-regime)

):

I expect that late cycle sectors like capital goods and commodity producers should be the surprise winners over the next 6-9 months. Investors should be accumulating positions now, while traders may either wait for oversold extremes or a technical breakout before buying.

**The week ahead**

Last Sunday, I postulated that stocks would see some consolidation and pullback, which is exactly what we saw in the week (see

[Global reflation = Buy risk (and cyclicals)](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2015/11/global-reflation-buy-risk-and-cyclicals.html)

). The weakness overshot my targets, however, as I expected initial SPX support at 2055-2060 to hold. Instead, the SPX retreated and tested the first Fibonacci retracement level of 2020\. Readings are oversold on RSI5 and the VIX Index, which is now above its upper Bollinger Band.

Breadth measures such as this chart of % of stocks above their 10 dma on

[IndexIndicators](http://www.indexindicators.com/indicators/breadth/http://www.indexindicators.com/indicators/breadth/)

are at levels where stocks have rallied in the past. These oversold conditions suggest that any stock market weakness in reaction to the Paris attacks should be viewed as temporary and a buying opportunity.

On an intermediate term basis, I view the market action last week in the context of a breather in the wake of a Zweig Breadth Thrust, which is a powerful bullish momentum signal that lasts many months (see

[Bingo! We have a buy signal!](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2015/10/bingo-we-have-buy-signal.html)

).

My inner investor remains bullishly positioned in stocks. My inner trader was averaging in as the market weakened last week. He bought a
