- en: ', along with many others, for basically rating securities as AAA when they
    subsequently many such securities, primarily MBS related to housing, defaulted.
    A AAA rating has a 0.03% ish annualized probability of default. My problem is
    that this is a mistake, not criminal. While Moody''s may have been overly incented
    to rate these securities highly, such an incentive has existed since the beginnings
    of the industry, and many other failed rating agencies neglected this at their
    peril (remember Duff & Phelps?). So, it''s a standard incentive problem that I
    don''t think is helped by piling on after the fact.'

    AAA securities because they turned out riskier than expected means that now the
    rating agencies, and brokers, have to 'underwrite' (ie, evaluate and due thorough
    analysis) the same securities. It is a fact that the senior piece of some capital
    investment will have a low probability of default, due to the value of the underlying
    business. For example, if you lend someone $100k to buy a house, and the house
    has an independent appraisal of $300k, the probability you will lose any money
    on that $100k is very small; for a large portfolio, basically absent. To now say
    that everything must be evaluated by everyone just creates waste, because the
    costs are too great, the benefits too small. Remember, a growing economy comes
    from doing more with less, and a large part of this is in information processing.
    We take for granted real GDP growth, but improved financial efficiency—innovation!—is
    part of that. The only way to guarantee no more blow ups is to guarantee no more
    growth, a poor bargain (Gillian Tett's book Fool's Gold seems to think innovation
    is something to be discouraged).

    have minuscule default rates. Such assets will be hypothecated by banks when deposited
    as collateral, making them effectively part of the monetary base. It's unavoidable,
    in the same way factional reserve banking is unavoidable.

    low risk because of their historical track record, which had minor losses in aggregate.
    No asset class has back-to-back surprises, so doubling down on mortgages is rather
    ahistorical from that perspective. Remember Commercial Real Estate? After its
    vicious 1990 cycle, default were historically low for the next 15 years (lot's
    of concern now, to be sure, however). Better to focus on other assets that have
    historically been safest. Why not raise the risk levels for municipal bonds, state
    bonds, even US government bonds? Clearly these have a potential for massive failure
    in spite of their golden track record. After all, many banks defaulted after the
    panic of 1838, surprising the Europeans who thought this unimaginable after they
    seemed so strong during the earlier panic of 1819\. But that would cut into the
    incentives of the regulators, not rich bankers (all 'bankers' are now caricatured
    as Goldman Sachs employees making $700k/year).

  zh: 希望他们记得联邦储备委员会和所有监管者之所以认为抵押贷款低风险，是因为它们在历史上的记录，总体上损失较小。没有任何资产类别能连续两次出现意外，所以把押抵押贷款是相当不合历史的。还记得商业地产吗？在其残酷的
    1990 年周期之后，违约率在接下来的 15 年中一直很低（现在当然也有很多担忧）。最好专注于历史上风险最低的其他资产。为什么不提高市政债券、州债券，甚至美国政府债券的风险水平呢？显然，尽管它们有着金光闪闪的业绩记录，但它们有潜在的巨大失败风险。毕竟，许多银行在
    1838 年的恐慌之后违约，令当时认为这是不可想象的欧洲人们震惊，因为他们在 1819 年早期的恐慌中看起来如此强大。但这会削弱监管者的激励，而不是富有的银行家（所有的"银行家"现在都被漫画化成年收入
    70 万美元的高盛员工）。
