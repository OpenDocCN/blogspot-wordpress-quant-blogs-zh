    action last week is best characterized as volatile and sloppy. The new high achieved
    on SPY on Friday was accomplished on low volume and a non-confirmation on OBV,

    the relative action of the cyclical stocks to see if a correction has truly begun.
    The chart below of the relative return of the Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index (CYC)
    against the market illustrates my point. CYC remains in a relative uptrend and
    it has pulled back to test the relative uptrend line - but I cannot call it a
    technical breakdown.

    the market as a measure of the risk-on trade shows that this sector remains in
    a solid relative uptrend. Should the market correct, the relative uptrend line
    is likely to be broken.

    is used as a measure of cyclicality. Currently, KOSPI is showing a pattern similar
    to the relative return of CYC to SPX - a pullback to test the uptrend line. It
    could be said, however, that since South Korea is a competitor to Japan in exporting
    capital goods to China, the recent JPY devaluation is creating headwinds for Korean
    stocks and the pullback may be reflective of those circumstances.

    picture shows that the uptrend to be intact and the bulls should still be given
    the benefit of the doubt for now. Nevertheless, my inner trader is closely watching
    these cyclical indicators and staying long with very tight stops.
