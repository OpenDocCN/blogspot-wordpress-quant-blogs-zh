    was flaring up and my [chart of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week)
    was the [Flight-to-Safety Trade](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/05/chart-of-week-flight-to-safety-trade.html).

    unfolding over the weekend and the future of [Greece](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Greece)
    and [Portugal](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Portugal) in the euro
    zone also being called into question over the course of the past two weeks, this
    seems like a good time to compare the performance of Europe against some of the
    other continents.

- en: While relative performance is almost always dependent upon the date one picks
    as a starting point, I still think many will be surprised to see in this week’s
    chart of the week below that at least over the course of the past six month,s
    Europe ([VGK](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VGK)) has performed
    on par with Latin America ([ILF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/ILF))
    and has significantly outperformed Asia ([VPL](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VPL))
    and the United States. Should Europe be able to finish the year without giving
    up any ground to its counterpart regional ETFs, I think the continent should be
    allowed to exhale and declare victory, at least for 2010.
