    In a word, libertarians. We like the right to use guns and drugs, and have sex
    in any consenting adult manner we please. But we also don't like taxes, and redistribution
    schemes like welfare and social security. Nevertheless, the major party divide
    in the US are social liberals/high taxers in one party, social conservative/low
    taxers on the other. Why is this the default when it seems so schizophrenic?

    believe in freedom to make such decisions for ourselves. But as California is
    in a huge structural budget deficit and has little ability to address spending,
    the need for cash to sustain the Beast is the real driver. As The Terminator notes:
    ''I think all of those ideas of creating extra revenues, I''m always for an open
    debate on it.'''

    War I. During the war federal revenues received through income taxation for the
    first time exceeded those from any other single source. By fall of 1917 Congress
    saw the income tax as its chief source of revenue, reducing the cost of voting
    for Prohibition in December 1917\.

    plunged beginning in 1931\. By 1932 federal income-tax receipts fell by well over
    a third from their level in 1931 and to almost half their 1930 level. Prohibition’s
    repeal in 1933 generated a big jump in revenues. As a percentage of federal government
    revenues, liquor taxes jumped from 2 percent in 1933 to 9 percent in 1934 to 13
    percent in 1936\.

    effect at some rate. In this context, taxing underground activities is a no-brainer
    for most Liberals, and so big-government types are in favor of legalizing activities
    that conservatives think are best kept underground. It's not a complete theory,
    but I think it explains some of our strange two-party idealogical cleavage.
