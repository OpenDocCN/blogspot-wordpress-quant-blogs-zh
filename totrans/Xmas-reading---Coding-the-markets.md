## Xmas reading

### December 1, 2008

Christmas is coming, and I’ve been figuring out my reading list for the break. I’ve pulled my old copy of G[odel, Escher, Bach](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach) off the shelf, and have started the first re-read for 20 years. A couple of things hit me right off the bat: how could I have missed the GEB/EGB (Godel,Escher,Bach/Eternal Golden Braid) sequencing pun ?  And it seems obvious that GEB is a big influence on [briarpig](http://www.briarpig.com/)‘s style. I’m also looking forward to reading [Hasbrouck](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~jhasbrou/)‘s [Empirical Market Microstructure](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~jhasbrou/EMM%20Book/EMM%20Home.htm). Looks like a natural successor to Harris’ [Trading and Exchanges](http://www.tradingandexchanges.com/).
Thought for the day: to be is to be the value of a bound variable.
