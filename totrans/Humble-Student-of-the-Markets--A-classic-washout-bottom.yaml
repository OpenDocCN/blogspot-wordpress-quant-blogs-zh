    to the possibility that the market may need one final panic for a tradable bottom
    to appear." What I didn't expect was the China Evergrande panic that gripped the
    market, though the subsequent relief rally was not unexpected.

    week to regain its 50-day moving average. The VIX Index flashed a buy signal when
    it rose above its upper Bollinger Band last week. However, traders should be aware
    of the caveat that rallies can stall once the VIX recycles from above the upper
    BB to the 20 dma. This scenario is a very real possibility as market jitters over
    a debt ceiling impasse, Treasury default, and a widespread government shutdown
    looms ahead.

  zh: 标准普尔500指数从历史高点下跌了-4%，并在周末反弹，重新站上了50日移动平均线。当VIX指数上周升穿其布林带上轨时，发出了买入信号。然而，交易员应该注意到一个警告，即一旦VIX从布林带上轨以上回跌至20日移动平均线，涨势可能会停滞。随着市场对债务上限僵局、财政部违约以及广泛的政府关门的担忧加剧，这种情况是一个非常现实的可能性。
