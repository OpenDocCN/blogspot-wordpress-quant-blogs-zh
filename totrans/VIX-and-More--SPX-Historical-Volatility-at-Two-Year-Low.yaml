    [holidays](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Holiday%20Effect) (due
    largely to fewer trading days), a point that slipped past many pundits is that
    [historical volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/historical%20volatility)
    (HV) has been excessively low during the past few weeks. In fact, last Wednesday
    the 20 day historical volatility in the SPX slipped below 10.00 for the first
    time since October 2007, about one week after the SPX topped at 1576.

    even at that level, HV sits at the 17^(th) percentile of SPX 20 day historical
    volatility readings for the past decade.

    2.12 on Friday – a level has only been reached four times in the last decade.
    Of those four instances, three (January 2000, January 2002 and May 2007) occurred
    prior to a substantial selloff.

    (red line) in the SPX and 20 day historically volatility (blue line). More often
    than not, when IV is substantially higher than HV, this is a bearish signal –
    or at least an indication that it is a good time to take profits.
