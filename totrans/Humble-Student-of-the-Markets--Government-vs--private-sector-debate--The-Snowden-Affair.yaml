- en: The story of Edward Snowden and how he got to be in a position where he could
    leak details of the National Security Administration’s (NSA) surveillance program
    is revealing a great deal about the privatization of our national security system.
    Much of what we are seeing is not pretty.

    national security apparatus?"

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, apart from the extensive system of surveillance at the NSA, Snowden
    has also called attention to the extent to which national security operations
    have been privatized. Of course, Snowden did not work directly for the government;
    he worked for Booz Allen Hamilton, a private contractor. Booz Allen is a $6 billion
    a year business. It gets the vast majority of its revenue from government contracts
    like the one that paid Snowden’s salary.

    paid more than $120,000 a year. That’s pretty good pay for someone who just turned
    30 and never graduated high school. Needless to say, Booz Allen was billing the
    taxpayers even more for Snowden’s work since they are in business to make a profit.
    Snowden may have had extraordinary skills that would justify this sort of pay,
    but there is no way for the public to know.

    security clearance was done by a private contractor. USIS, a company based in
    northern Virginia, did the background check on Snowden and many other people with
    security clearance.

    his own, or they are mercenaries, auxiliaries, or mixed. Mercenaries and auxiliaries
    are useless and dangerous; and if one holds his state based on these arms, he
    will stand neither firm nor safe; for they are disunited, ambitious and without
    discipline, unfaithful, valiant before friends, cowardly before enemies; they
    have neither the fear of God nor fidelity to men, and destruction is deferred
    only so long as the attack is; for in peace one is robbed by them, and in war
    by the enemy. The fact is, they have no other attraction or reason for keeping
    the field than a trifle of stipend, which is not sufficient to make them willing
    to die for you. ***They are ready enough to be your soldiers whilst you do not
    make war, but if war comes they take themselves off or run from the foe; which
    I should have little trouble to prove, for the ruin of Italy has been caused by
    nothing else than by resting all her hopes for many years on mercenaries, and
    although they formerly made some display and appeared valiant amongst themselves,
    yet when the foreigners came they showed what they were.*** Thus it was that Charles,
    King of France, was allowed to seize Italy with chalk in hand; 1 and he who told
    us that our sins were the cause of it told the truth, but they were not the sins
    he imagined, but those which I have related. And as they were the sins of princes,
    it is the princes who have also suffered the penalty.

    are either capable men or they are not; if they are, you cannot trust them, because
    they always aspire to their own greatness, either by oppressing you, who are their
    master, or others contrary to your intentions; but if the captain is not skilful,
    you are ruined in the usual way.

    or not, I reply that when arms have to be resorted to, either by a prince or a
    republic, then the prince ought to go in person and perform the duty of captain;
    the republic has to send its citizens, and when one is sent who does not turn
    out satisfactorily, it ought to recall him, and when one is worthy, to hold him
    by the laws so that he does not leave the command. And experience has shown princes
    and republics, single-handed, making the greatest progress, and mercenaries doing
    nothing except damage; and it is more difficult to bring a republic, armed with
    its own arms, under the sway of one of its citizens than it is to bring one armed
    with foreign arms. Rome and Sparta stood for many ages armed and free. The Switzers
    are completely armed and quite free.

    or power not founded on its own strength. And one''s own forces are those which
    are composed either of subjects, citizens, or dependants; all others are mercenaries

    willing to bear the costs, they will bear the consequences of the use of a mercenary
    force, as Machiavelli predicted about 500 years ago. We have to bear in mind that,
    for certain functions, government does some things better than the private sector.
