## Drive – Do you have it?

Can’t remember who recommended this [book](http://www.danpink.com/books/drive/), but it was worth the read. Of note:

*   Page 32, “As organizations flatten, companies need people who are self-motivated”
*   Chapter 2, “Seven Reasons Carrots and Sticks (Often) Don’t Work…”
*   Page 51, “People will choose the quickest route” to the destination for an extrinsic reward
*   Page 57, “Companies pay a steep price for not extending their gaze beyond the next quarter”
*   Page 86, Results-Only Work Environment (ROWE)
*   Page 138, “The MBA Oath”
*   Page 162, “Try 20% Time With Training Wheels”
*   Page 169, “Turn Your Next Off-Site into a FedEx Day”
*   Page 173, “If you use performance metrics, make then wide-ranging, relevant, and hard to game”
*   Page 203,  “Carrot & sticks are last century.  Drive says for 21st century work, we need to upgrade to autonomy, mastery and purpose”
