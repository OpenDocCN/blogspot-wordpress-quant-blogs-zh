- en: Over the years I have changed my learning process from reading thoroughly first
    before proceeding to reading minimally and then applying immediately.  I very
    quickly see the gaps in my knowledge.  This method is far more painful but seems
    to quicken progress up the learning curve.  You will definitely see the process
    in its entirety with this series on latex, knitr, and performance reporting. 
    For those who are still hesitating, jump right in with me and let me know your
    result.

- en: As I experimented with Attempt 2, I could see from others sample .Rnw files
    that LyX can serve as the IDE for Sweave/knitr documents, and I thought this would
    be a more pleasant route.  However it was not, and I eventually reverted back
    to old-school manual coding.  This [post from R, Ruby, and Finance](http://viksalgorithms.blogspot.com/2012/01/using-latex-r-and-sweave-to-create.html)
    talks about TeXnic Center as an IDE.  Maybe I will try it for attempt 3\. I am
    still a long way from a useable result (any bets on how many attempts it takes?),
    but the report is definitely an improvement

    pdf report.  However, the code is still all there for public view within the .Rnw
    file.

    distraction. Look for that in future posts.
