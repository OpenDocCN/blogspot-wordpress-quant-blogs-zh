- en: I came across this [site](http://www.traderbots.com/) today. I’m not a huge
    believer in technical analysis as a basis for trading, however these guys are
    doing something interesting. They are generating / seeding strategies as a genetic
    program based on a combination of technical, momentum, and sentiment inputs into
    a neural net. These are then bred / cross-pollinated to refine further.

    I suspect they are doing the following:'

- en: It is an automated approach to strategy descovery, avoiding costly manual research.
    Though it does not appear to make use of more sophisticated inputs & models, the
    general approach is nice. It would not be a surprise to find that some of these
    strategies are successful.

    (such as basis function based signal decomposition, stochastic state systems,
    etc).
