- en: Harris bills section 14.3 of [Trading & Exchanges](http://www.tradingandexchanges.com),
    on adverse selection and uninformed traders, as the most important lesson in the
    book. Trading authors often comment that novice traders get ground down by transaction
    costs. We all know that trading is a zero sum game. Harris explains exactly how
    trading by dealers and informed speculators grinds down the rest in that zero
    sum game. “Informed” means informed on fundamental values.

    they deal. Adverse selection is the risk that a better informed trader will take
    one of a dealers prices and leave them with a position against which the market
    subsequently moves, making it difficult to unwind that position. If a dealer thinks
    they’ve just traded with a better informed trader, they can take several steps
    in mitigation: they can change quoted prices and sizes to discourage further trades
    on the same side, and encourage trades on the other side. Or they can unwind an
    unwanted position immediately by paying for liquidity and taking someone else’s
    prices. Or they can hedge eg buy the future if they just sold the bond.'

    side of the market: buying before a drop or selling before a rally. They lose
    because dealers build the cost of adverse selection into their spreads, among
    other reasons. So the zero sum game means that dealers charge uninformed traders
    for their losses to informed traders. Of course, dealers can and should be well
    informed traders themselves, even if they do encounter better informed traders
    in the market.'
