    space since…well I’m not sure exactly, but I’m guessing the May 2016 launch of
    the now defunct [VMIN](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VMIN) and [VMAX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VMAX)
    products.  Back [in 2016, I tracked 27 different VIX ETPs](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2016/05/update-vix-etp-landscape-including-vmax.html)
    and while there were several obvious leaders, the field was still in flux at that
    time.  In the intervening six years, it has been a war of attrition and that attrition
    has seen some spectacular departures and renovations, including the “[Volmageddon](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Volmageddon)”
    demise of [XIV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XIV) and the subsequent
    downward recalibration of leverage in issues such as [UVXY](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/UVXY)
    and [SVXY](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SVXY).

- en: This time around we have two promising ETFs that will be positioned in two critical
    spaces in the VIX ETP landscape, as the graphic below shows. Not only are these
    products ETFs that avoid some of the potential problems associated with ETNs,
    including credit/counterparty risk, issuance/creation units risk, and acceleration/closure
    risk, but they make a valiant effort to address some of the daily rebalancing
    issues highlighted by the Volmageddon fiasco on February 5, 2018.

- en: Specifically, the feature of these products that I find particularly compelling
    is the new methodology for daily rebalancing, which essentially uses time-weighted
    average prices in 5-second intervals covering the last 15 minutes of the standard
    trading session.  In this manner, the risks associated with liquidity of after-hours
    rebalancing or dramatic pre-close spikes are all but eliminated.  For more on
    the details of the end-of-day rebalancing methodology, I recommend Vance Harwood’s
    [Why We Need the LONGVOL & SHORTVOL Indexes](https://sixfigureinvesting.com/2022/01/how-do-the-shortvol-and-longvol-indexes-work/).

    units](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2022/03/barclays-suspends-creation-units-for-vxx.html),
    both UVIX and SVIX are launching at an opportune time to take market share.  I
    believe UVIX and SVIX benefit from a superior product design, an improved end-of-day
    rebalancing methodology, the preferred ETF product wrapper, and attractive leverage/inverse
    multipliers.  All they need is some liquidity and an active options market before
    they have the potential to supplant UVXY and VXX as the top products in the VIX
    ETP space.

    various incarnations since 2010), I have plotted all of the VIX ETPs with respect
    to their target maturity (X-axis) and leverage (Y-axis).  [Note that TVIXF and
    ZIVF, currently traded in very low volumes on the pink sheets, have been omitted
    from this matrix.]

    (-1x, with a 5-month average maturity) and I would consider all the important
    VIX ETP white spaces to be restored.
