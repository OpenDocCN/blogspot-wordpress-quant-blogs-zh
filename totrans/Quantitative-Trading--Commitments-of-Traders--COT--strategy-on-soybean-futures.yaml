- en: 'In our drive to extract alphas from a variety of non-price data, we came across
    this old-fashioned source: Commitments of Traders (COT) on futures. This indicator
    is well-known to futures traders since 1923 (see www.cmegroup.com/education/files/COT_FBD_Update_2012-4-26.pdf),
    but there are often persistent patterns (risk factors?) in the markets that refuse
    to be arbitraged away. It is worth another look, especially since the data has
    become richer over the years.'

- en: 1) CFTC collects the reports of the number of long and short futures and options
    contracts ("open interest") held by different types of firms by Tuesdays, and
    reports them every Friday by 4:30 CT.

- en: 2) Options positions are added to COT as if they were futures but adjusted by
    their deltas.

- en: 3) COT are then broken down into contracts held by different types of firms.
    The most familiar types are "Commercial" (e.g. an ethanol plant) and "Non-Commercial"
    (i.e. speculators).

    Managers", etc. There are 9 mutually exclusive types in total.

- en: Since we only have historical COT data from csidata.com, and they do not collect
    data on all these types, we have to restrict our present analysis only to Commercial
    and Non-Commercial. Also, beware that csidata tags a COT report by its Tuesday
    data collection date. As noted above, that information is unactionable until the
    following Sunday evening when the market re-opens.

- en: 'A simple strategy would be to compute the ratio of long vs short COT for Non-Commercial
    traders. We buy the front contract when this ratio is equal to or greater than
    3, exiting when the ratio drops to or below 1\. We short the front contract when
    this ratio is equal to or less than 1/3, exiting when the ratio rises to or above
    1\. Hence this is a momentum strategy: we trade in the same direction as the speculators
    did. As most profitable futures traders are momentum traders, it would not be
    surprising this strategy could be profitable.'

    returns about 9% per annum, though its best period seems to be behind us already.
    I have plotted the cumulative returns below (click to enlarge).

- en: I have applied this strategy to a few other agricultural commodities, but it
    doesn't seem to work on them. It is therefore quite possible that the positive
    result on soybeans is a fluke. Also, it is very unsatisfactory that we do not
    have data on the Money Managers (which include the all important CPOs and CTAs),
    since they would likely to be an important source of alpha. Of course, we can
    go directly to the cftc.gov,
