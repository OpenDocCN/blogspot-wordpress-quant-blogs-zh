    they are any easier to create almost 4,000 years later. LaTeX is the clear winner
    when it comes to the table making competition. I have used **xtable** for HTML
    tables, but it could not fully produce a complicated table.  I was delighted to
    recently find the [**Gmisc**](http://gforge.se/2013/02/tables-from-r-into-word/)
    package, which is the result of a frustrated orthopaedic surgeon's need to create
    tables in Word for journal submission.

    I was not aware of the need to produce a Word .doc from R. I simply thought creating
    an html table should not be that hard.
