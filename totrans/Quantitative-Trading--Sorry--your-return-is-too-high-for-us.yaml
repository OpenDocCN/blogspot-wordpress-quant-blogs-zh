    to find a successful trading strategy, but its focus is to tell you how to market
    your fund to investors once you have a successful strategy. To that end, it does
    a pretty good job in conveying what might be conventional wisdom to seasoned fund
    managers. (For e.g., don''t bother to market to institutional investors if your
    AUM is less than $100M.) The book is filled with quite engaging interviews with
    fund managers, fund marketers, and other fund service providers (including our
    very own administrator Fund Associates). If Scott Patterson''s'

    don''t want to look at a fund that actually achieved double-digit monthly returns.
    Presumably that''s because they believe that a high return automatically implies
    high risk, and also presumably a high leverage as well.  I would argue that there
    are 2 reasons not to completely dismiss such funds out-of-hand:'

    minimum of what's dictated by half-Kelly (see my extensive discussions of Kelly
    formula on this blog and in my book) and what's dictated by the maximum single-day
    drawdown seen historically or in VaR simulations. And if this minimum still turns
    out to be higher than what most institutional investors are comfortable with,
    one should be bold enough to adopt it in your fund.

- en: '2) As an investor, there is an easy way to control leverage and risk: just
    apply Constant Proportion Portfolio Insurance (a concept also discussed elsewhere
    on this blog). For example, if the fund manager tells you the fund employs a constant
    10x leverage (as dictated by the risk analysis outlined in 1) and you are only
    comfortable with 5x leverage, just invest half your capital into the fund, and
    keep the other half as cash in your bank account! Going forward, if the fund loses
    money, your effective leverage would have decreased to below 5x. Say you invested
    $1M into the fund, and kept $1M in the bank. And say the fund lost $0.5M. Your
    total equity is now $1.5M, and the fund manager is supposed to trade a $0.5M*10=$5M
    portfolio. Your effective leverage is now only 3.33x, well within your tolerance.
    Now if instead, the fund made money, you can immediately withdraw some of the
    profits to keep your effective leverage at 5x. So, say the fund made $0.5M. Your
    equity is now $2.5M, and the fund manager is supposed to trade a $1.5M*10=$15M
    portfolio. If you don''t withdraw, this would increase your effective leverage
    to 6x. But if you immediately withdraw $0.25M, then the fund manager will trade
    a $1.25M*10=$12.5M portfolio, giving you an effective leverage of the desired
    5x.'
