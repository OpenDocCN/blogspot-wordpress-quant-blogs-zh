- en: After under preparing for the big snowstorm in December 2010, Mayor Bloomberg
    over prepared for Hurricane Irene, which left New York City with pretty minor
    damage. This pattern is rather typical, because the cost/benefit ratio for over
    hyping a disaster clearly favors over-reacting after under reacting. Bad events
    are usually really damaging only when we totally do not see them coming.

  zh: 2010年12月大雪暴来临之前准备不充分，市长布隆伯格对2008年抵抗飓风艾琳准备充分过度消极，这导致纽约市只受到了较小的损失。这种情况相当典型，因为高估灾难在低估之后的成本／收益比是明显偏向于过度反应。只有当我们完全没有察觉时，不良事件通常才会真正造成严重破坏。
- en: 'Back in 1999, every risk management department had allocated considerable resources
    to the Y2K problem: that old software with two digit dates would implode at the
    end of the year. Many scaremongers conjured up plausible hypothetical, generalized,
    and scared the crap out of everyone. It turned out to be a non-event, and probably
    would not have been a problem even if there was no preparation.'
