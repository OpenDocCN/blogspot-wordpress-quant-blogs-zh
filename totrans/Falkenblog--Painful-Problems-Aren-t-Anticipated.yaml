    over prepared for Hurricane Irene, which left New York City with pretty minor
    damage. This pattern is rather typical, because the cost/benefit ratio for over
    hyping a disaster clearly favors over-reacting after under reacting. Bad events
    are usually really damaging only when we totally do not see them coming.

    to the Y2K problem: that old software with two digit dates would implode at the
    end of the year. Many scaremongers conjured up plausible hypothetical, generalized,
    and scared the crap out of everyone. It turned out to be a non-event, and probably
    would not have been a problem even if there was no preparation.'

    extent of the mortgage problem even after it was identified. The extent of the
    decline in underwriting, the legislative and regulatory reaction that lowered
    borrower''s willingness to pay, was totally unappreciated. The base idea is that
    most experts didn''t understand the crisis as it was happening, which is why things
    were as bad as they were. The things that hurt us are those things expert conventional
    wisdom does not see coming.'
