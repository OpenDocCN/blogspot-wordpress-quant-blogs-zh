    are responsible for a big portion of the marginal flows into corporate credit
    markets in recent years. Mutual funds now account for $1.7 trillion of the market,
    up 69 percent from the first quarter of 2009, and ETFs are responsible for $200
    billion – up 328 percent in the same time period.

    to total returns, particularly negative total returns. And if 10-year Treasury
    rates were to rise anywhere near what our economists expect (again, 2.5% by year
    end) total returns in the corporate market may very well be negative. And if returns
    do in fact turn negative, we would expect investors to scale back mutual fund
    investments, creating forced sellers.

    How exactly do you think you will collect on any of those loans if there is a

    it back? Average FICO of 602? If you know a bit about credit scores, you know
