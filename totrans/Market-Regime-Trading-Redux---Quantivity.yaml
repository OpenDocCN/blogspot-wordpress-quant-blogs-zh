    readers is market regime trading: *systematic trading via heterogeneous portfolio
    of algorithmic trading strategies, whose dynamic selection and optimization is
    driven by quantitative analysis of current market regime*.'

    Regime Dashboard](https://quantivity.wordpress.com/2009/08/23/market-regime-dashboard/)
    and [Trade Using Market Regimes?](https://quantivity.wordpress.com/2009/09/20/trade-using-market-regimes/).
    By any measure of reader interest (active or passive), the concept of regime trading
    is unexpected popular. Several subsequent months have been spent in literature
    review, discussion with colleagues, and quiet reflection.'

    as it squarely acknowledges the admittedly unpleasant financial postulate: *there
    is no single low-frequency trading strategy that works consistently under all
    market regimes*. Or, in [trader-speak](http://www.amazon.com/Trading-Regime-Analysis-Probability-Volatility/dp/0470987855):
    “there is no holy grail”. This postulate also underlies why [naïve backtesting
    is bogus](https://quantivity.wordpress.com/2009/08/16/naive-backtesting-is-bogus/).'
