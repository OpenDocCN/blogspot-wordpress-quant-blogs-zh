    obtain such data, whether historical or live. This is especially true for foreign
    exchange transactions which occur over-the-counter. Recognizing the profit potential
    of such data, most FX market operators guard them as their crown jewels, never
    to be revealed to customers. But recently FXCM, a FX broker, has kindly provided

    all trades transacted on FXCM occurring in 2017, time stamped in milliseconds,
    and with their trade prices and signed trade sizes. The sign of a trade is positive
    if it is the result of a buy market order, and negative if it is the result of
    a sell. If we take the absolute value of these trade sizes and sum them over hourly
    intervals, we obtain the usual hourly volumes (click to enlarge) aggregated over

    with the previous day's order flow. The spread between the top and bottom quintiles
    is about 12 bps, which annualizes to about 30%. This doesn't mean we will generate
    30% annualized returns, since we won't be able to arbitrage between today's return
    (if the order flow is in the top or bottom quintile) with some previous day's
    return when its order flow was in the opposite extreme. Nevertheless, it is encouraging.
    Also, this is an illustration that even though order flow must be computed on

    is satisfied. We can't really expect that this relationship holds 100%, due to
    rare occasions that the quote has moved in the sub-millisecond after the trade
    occurred and the change is reported as synchronous with the trade, or when there
    is a delay in the reporting of either a trade or a quote change.

    flow is in the top quintile among its last 20 days'' values, and hold for one
    day, and short it when it is in the bottom quintile. Since our daily flow was
    measured at midnight New York time, we also define the end of day at that time.
    (Similar results are obtained if we use London or Zurich''s midnight, which suggests
    we can stagger our positions.) In my backtest, I have subtracted 0.20 bps commissions
