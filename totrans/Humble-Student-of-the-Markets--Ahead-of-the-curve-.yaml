    rather than (as you might expect) the party's subordinated pragmatists. The sensible
    center is much more likely to exert itself inside existing parties, as Dwight
    Eisenhower did for Republicans in the 1950s and as Bill Clinton did for the Democrats
    in the 1990s.

    Tea party Republicans prefer to express their principles regardless of consequences,

    impact on the economy.

    races lost to the GOP by extremist nominations.
