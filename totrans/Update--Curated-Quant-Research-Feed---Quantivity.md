# Update: Curated Quant Research Feed | Quantivity

> 来源：[https://quantivity.wordpress.com/2011/11/04/update-curated-quant-research-feed/#0001-01-01](https://quantivity.wordpress.com/2011/11/04/update-curated-quant-research-feed/#0001-01-01)

Quantivity is pleasantly surprised to discover an increasing number of folks are deriving value from the [Curated Quant Research Feed](https://quantivity.wordpress.com/2011/07/28/curated-research-feed/) on [@Quantivity](http://twitter.com/quantivity). Indeed, the combo of daily curated feed with *single-source* retrospective search has become indispensable for personal research. Towards understanding why, Kedrosky provides nice explanation in his [Curation is the New Search is the New Curation](http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/2011/01/curation_is_the.html) post earlier this year:

> Head back to curation and watch new algos emerge on top of that next-gen curation again. Think of Twitter as a new stab at curation. Curated sites will re-seed a new generation of algorithmic search sites. In short, curation is the new search.

Indeed, intent of curation here is to maintain *high signal-to-noise ratio* for a mix of preprint and classics in a *highly-specialized* literature (*i.e.* combo of retail ![\mathbb{P}](img/f2d0e071de256bbddee88d21a6582414.png) and prop ![\mathbb{Q}](img/969ce5c634b2b4963929a6476f8ccc63.png)) for which strong motivation exists elsewhere to obfuscate; and search over the stream provides ability to both rewind time and to integrate *conceptual connectivity* spanning time.

One addition being contemplated is keyword search over all literature cited in feed, providing *deep content search* over the feed. Although, unclear yet what is the best technical avenue to implement this (please comment, if you have suggestions).

So, with this positive start, curation input set is being modestly expanded to coincide with increased personal research activity and availability of several new quant sources—*while maintaining the same focus and high signal-to-noise goal*. Specifically, curation is expanding to include the following SSRN working papers: [ARPM Series](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/JELJOUR_Results.cfm?form_name=journalbrowse&journal_id=1681611) and [JEL Codes](http://www.aeaweb.org/jel/jel_class_system.php) G11 (Portfolio Choice), G12 (Asset Pricing), G13 (Contingent Pricing; Futures Pricing), G14 (Information and Market Efficiency), C21 (Cross-Sectional Models), C22 (Time-Series Models), C51 (Model Construction and Estimation), and C53 (Forecasting and Other Model Applications). Selection of JEL codes is data-driven: feed links were ranked by JEL classification and most cited classifications were chosen.

Authors are encouraged to ensure correct use of JEL codes, to ensure your articles are picked up.

Curious what readers think? Are there other high-value sources worth adding to curation input set? What else could make this more useful?
