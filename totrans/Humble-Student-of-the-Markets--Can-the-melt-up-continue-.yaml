    an astounding six consecutive days. The risk-on rally came to a screeching halt
    when China reported was considering slowing down or halting its purchases of Treasury
    paper. The initial reaction saw the yield on 10-year Treasury note spiked and
    a steepening of the yield curve, though both ended the day roughly unchanged.
    At the same time, the stock market took a risk-off tone. Here is the

    holdings have recommended slowing or halting purchases of U.S. Treasuries, according
    to people familiar with the matter. The news comes as global debt markets were
    already selling off amid signs that central banks are starting to step back after
    years of bond-buying stimulus. Yields on 10-year Treasuries rose for a fifth day,
    touching the highest since March.

    the officials’ recommendations have been adopted. The market for U.S. government
    bonds is becoming less attractive relative to other assets, and trade tensions
    with the U.S. may provide a reason to slow or stop buying American debt, the thinking
    of these officials goes, according to the people, who asked not to be named as
    they aren’t allowed to discuss the matter publicly.
