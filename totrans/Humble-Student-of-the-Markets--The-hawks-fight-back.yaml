    policymakers, even if Bullard joins Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther
    George in hawkish dissent. What remains important heading into 2013 (aside from
    the data, of course), is Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke. He can pull the
    moderates where he wants to go. And it obviously is not in a hawkish direction.

    not have a significant impact on policy making. They will only appear to have
    an impact on policy if the data signals that a policy shift is needed. Given the
    current set of policymakers on the Fed, the hawks will only have a voice if Bernanke
    is replaced with one of their own. And that is when it would get interesting,
    as I am not sure that the moderates would follow a hawkish Chairman.'
