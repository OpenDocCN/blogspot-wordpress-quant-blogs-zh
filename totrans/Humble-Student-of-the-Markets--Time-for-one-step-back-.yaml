    Despite the upward bias shown by the stock market last week, I remain convinced
    that equities remain in a trading range. In that case, the coming week might be
    a opportunity for stocks to take one step back.

    Big Three are behaving, namely the US, Europe and China. In the US, a glance of
    the chart of the SPX tells the story. The market remains in an ascending triangle
    pattern, but was rejected at resistance on Friday. This suggests to me to expect

    displaying a pattern that is eerily similar to the previous two charts.

    sensitive to Chinese demand while Canada is more sensitive to American demand.
    The AUDCAD staged a minor breakout last week. Will the breakout hold?

    level and may be in the process of pulling back. How it performs in the coming
    week will give further clues of whether the bulls can make a stand or if we are
    back to the same-old-same-old of choppy and direction-less markets.
