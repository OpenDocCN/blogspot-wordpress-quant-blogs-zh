As always, anything you read on this blog will likely lead to significant losses, and anyone with any sense will just ignore my silliness and move on. However, just for posterity, I am beginning to short US equities with reckless abandon. Beyond that, I realize that I have lost a lot of respect for investors and speculators that I have admired over the years. In time, we shall see.
