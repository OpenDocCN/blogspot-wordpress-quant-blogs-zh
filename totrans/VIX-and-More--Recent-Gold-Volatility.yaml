- en: I have been receiving quite a few questions about [gold](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/gold)
    and gold volatility lately, so with gold receiving a lot of attention in the press,
    I thought this would be a good time to check in on the commodity and on the CBOE’s
    gold volatility index ([GVZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/GVZ)),
    which was launched back in August.

    the ebb and flow of opinions about the risk of deflation in the short run and
    inflation over the longer run.

- en: In the chart below, I have captured the price action in the commodity as tracked
    by [GLD](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/GLD), the popular gold bullion
    ETF. I have also included the GVZ (aka “Gold VIX”) to gauge some of the recent
    volatility in gold trading. Gold volatility peaked back on October 10^(th) and
    has been in a gradual downtrend for the past six weeks. The chart reflects that
    spikes in gold volatility have generally coincided with spikes in the price of
    the commodity.

- en: The broader issue of correlations between gold prices and volatility is much
    more complicated and subject to cyclical swings. In the chart I have highlighted
    two periods in which gold and gold volatility have shown a persistent negative
    correlation, first in August and later in mid-October. These two instances were
    both bearish for gold prices, yet when the correlation switched back to a positive
    one, gold prices began to move up in both instances.

    and gold volatility, but I will return to this subject periodically as my thinking
    evolves on the subject.
