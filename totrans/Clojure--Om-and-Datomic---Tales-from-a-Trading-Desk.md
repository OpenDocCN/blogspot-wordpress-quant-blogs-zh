# Clojure: Om and Datomic | Tales from a Trading Desk

## Clojure: Om and Datomic

Since [Om](https://github.com/swannodette/om)‘s release there have been a number of interesting GitHub projects, and postings. Below is a list of possibly relevant reading for anyone interested in Om.  It’s probably also working looking at Datomic 😉

Given my previous posting on Clojure, I wonder how far any of the sell-side are willing to go today with Om?
