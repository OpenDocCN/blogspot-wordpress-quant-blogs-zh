    spent with children is often considered the least pleasurable part of a person’s
    day, and when you control for the standard socioeconomic variables adults with
    children are less happy than those with children. Ever play ‘Shoots and Ladders’?
    It's boring. Jerry Seinfeld once joked that many games are advertised as “fun
    for the whole family. Nothing is fun for the whole family!”

    incompetent at your job, but your 5 year old will still need you very much. There
    is a basic appreciation for one’s biological parents, regardless of how much they
    actually hang out (note Obama's elevation of his sperm-donor dad), and the littlest
    things a grandparent does for a child is often looked back at with profound appreciation.
    For example, in

    remembers throwing a tantrum about not wanting to go to school. His frail 80 year
    old grandfather, the American President John Quincy Adams (son of President and
    Founding Father John Adams), appears, and takes his hand, and walked him silently
    a mile to the schoolhouse. No lecture, just a walk, but right to school, and the
    tantrum was over. Looking back, Henry Adams notes that “the seeds of a moral education
    would at that moment have fallen on the stoniest soil in Quincy”. These are the
    things parents and grandparents strive for, hoping that when they are long gone
    a consciousness truly appreciates something they have done in a profound way.'

    very focused on leaving memories behind: getting picture albums in order, organizing
    mementos from our past that we could cherish in her absence. The thought of making
    having someone engage in traditions she helped create consumed her objectives
    until she lost the ability to pursue them.'

    time, and does not need children to manufacture appreciation, and so as children
    are substitutes for generating appreciation, and resources are limited, many career-oriented
    women are childless by choice. I think children are great investment in creating
    something that needs you, that connects you to the future. Not only do toddlers
    need you, but so will their kids, which is especially rewarding during a period
    in one's life when your professional duties create no need for you. For the poor
    with no market skills, kids are a sure way to make yourself important, at least
    in someone's eyes.

    work or physical pain is as stressful is being in a situation where you feel your
    talents are unappreciated, and you see little hope of changing things. The null
    feeling of people towards each other is indifference, and so a person unappreciated
    by everyone has done nothing to earn favor, and knows it. What makes this so terrible
    is that unappreciation is persistent, whereas physical pain is temporary. When
    I think about making my children successful, it primarily involves imagining them
    in a situation where they are appreciated because of their competence, courage,
    empathy, and good humor. If all I knew was that many people truly appreciated
    them, and not in the condescending way people say they appreciate unskilled workers,
    it wouldn't matter to me whether they were rich or poor.

    traditional objective function takes one's consumption as the primary objective,
    and then present values the 'utility' of this consumption. This leads to weird
    convolutions, where one 'consumes' children, and actually doesn't enjoy their
    company but still prefers them. I think a more reasonable approach would be to
    assume people are maximizing their external appreciation in society. This is going
    to be increasing in wealth, because the more money one has, the more favors one
    can do, the more people will flatter you to get business or use your boat. And
    it all gets back to maximizing status. A status maximizer maximizes his appreciation
    in this world. Someone looking merely at their consumption bundle should consider
    themselves rich in the West even if they are at the bottom of society working
    as a parking attendant, but of course they would not feel rich at all, they would
    feel very poor. As people crave appreciation from others, maximizing their status
    is a direct path to that end. So is having children.
