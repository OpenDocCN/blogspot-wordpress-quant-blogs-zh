- en: In physics and probability theory, mean field theory (MFT also known as self-consistent
    field theory) studies the behavior of large and complex stochastic models by studying
    a simpler model. Such models consider a large number of small interacting individuals
    who interact with each other. The effect of all the other individuals on any given
    individual is approximated by a single averaged effect, thus reducing a many-body
    problem to a one-body problem.

    Weiss to describe phase transitions.[2] Approaches inspired by these ideas have
    seen applications in epidemic models,[3] queueing theory,[4] computer network
    performance and game theory.[5]

    is not used in physics. The mean field approach in physics is indeed the direct
    analogy to the representative agent technique. Theorists use it all the time,
    as it is simple and leads quickly to results that are sometimes reasonably correct
    (sometimes even exact). And sometimes not correct.

    each elementary magnetic unit in the material (for simplicity, think of it as
    the magnetic moment of a single atom that is itself like a tiny magnet) acts *independently
    of every other.* That is, each one responds to the overall mean field created
    by all the atoms throughout the entire material, rather than to, for example,
    its closest neighbors. In this approximation, the magnetic behavior of the whole
    is simply a scaled up version of that of the individual atoms. Interactions between
    nearby magnetic elements do not matter. All is very simple.

    mechanics book -- and you get a self-consistency condition for the bulk magnetization.
    Lo and behold, you find a sharp phase transition with temperature, much like what
    happens in real iron magnets. A piece of iron is non-magnetic above a certain
    critical temperature, and spontaneously becomes magnetic when cooled below that
    temperature. So, voila! The mean field method works, *sometimes.* But this is
    only the beginning of the story.

- en: Curie and Weiss wrote down theories like this in the early 1900s and this way
    of thinking remained in fashion into the 1950s. Famed Russian physicist Lev Landau
    developed a much more general theory of phase transitions based on the idea. But
    here's the kicker -- since the 1960s, i.e. for half a century now, we have known
    that this theory does not work in general, and that the mean field approximation
    often breaks down badly, because different parts of a material aren't statistically
    independent. Especially near the temperature of the phase transition, you get
    strong correlations between different magnetic moments in iron, so what one is
    doing strongly influences what others are likely to be doing. Assume statistical
    independence now and you get completely incorrect results. The mean field trick
    fails, and sometimes very dramatically. As a simple example, a string of magnetic
    elements in one dimension, held on a line, does not undergo *any phase transition
    at all*, in complete defiance of the mean field prediction.

    century has been devoted to overcoming this failure, and to learning how go beyond
    the mean field approximation, to understand systems in which the correlations
    between parts are strong and important. I believe that it will be crucial for
    economics to plunge into the same complex realm, if any serious understanding
    is to be had of the most important events in finance and economics, which typically
    do involve strong influences acting between people. The very successful models
    that John Geanakoplos developed to predict mortgage prepayment rates only worked
    by including an important element of contagion -- people becoming more likely
    to prepay when many others prepay, presumably because they become more aware of
    the possibility and wisdom of doing so.

    few minutes. But this is a topic that deserves a little further examination. For
    example, those power laws that econophysicists seem to find so fascinating? These
    also seem to really irritate those writing on econjobrumors. But what we know
    about power laws in physical systems is that they are often (though not always)
    the signature if strong correlations among the different elements of a system....
     so they may indeed be trying to tell us something.
