    like asking what happens to Yankees if they lose their starting pitcher. Sure,
    they will be worse. How much worse? People will disagree. Indeed, the more knowledgeable
    the person, the greater the range in their disagreement. An ignorant person would
    probably just compare the wins of the pitcher to the average of the staff and
    take the difference. A more sophisticated Sabermetrics approach would look at
    the pitcher's recent performance, especially in spring season, how this compared
    to last year, as well as his best year.

    I think they will find impossible. Pointing to 'models' and sophisticated reasoning
    are not enough. Show us the assumptions, the simulations, the delineation of risk
    within the institution by obligor and facility, and there is no way you can not
    reject the hypothesis the number you generate is off by a factor of 3, which would
    generate a totally different policy recommendation.

    be perfect, you are ensuring failure. This is because if you believe bank assets
    and their sensitivities do not have large standard errors, you would do a different
    policy than if they do have large standard errors.

    the problem is because you can't let ships carry small arms, you can't shoot all
    the pirates, the pirates are just trying to make money and generally don't hurt
    their victims (I snipped 1 minute of their whiny reasoning below). Fundamentally,
    there is no perfect solution, which in the end they noted was really irsksome.
    In their academic circles, this sounds like reasoned debate, but it is merely
    wimpy indecision in the face of a dilemma driven by an imperfect solution. It
    reminded me of the scene in Godfather Part 1 where the Don slaps a crying Johnny

  zh: 在两位政治科学家之间，他们正在讨论问题的“复杂性”，因为你不能让船只携带小武器，也不能射杀所有海盗，而海盗只是为了赚钱，通常不会伤害受害者（下面我剪掉了1分钟他们抱怨的理由）。从根本上讲，没有完美的解决方案，最后他们指出这确实是非常烦人的。在他们的学术圈里，这听起来像是合理的辩论，但实际上是面对一个不完美解决方案所引发的懦弱无法决定。这让我想起了教父第一部中的一幕，唐·科里昂打了哭泣的约翰尼·方丹，说道“你得像个男人！”。
