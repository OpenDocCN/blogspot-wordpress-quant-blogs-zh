- en: I remember way back when I read Liar's Poker, and thought, good read, but wrong.
    That is, to the extent Michael Lewis stuck to personalities, anecdotes about the
    rich and famous, and allusions to his major of art history, he was great. When
    he made riffs on economics, such as, that it's all based on hype, or everyone
    is a big faker, it was an overstatement to a considerable degree, and degree is
    ultimately important. It's not all a game of BSDs playing macho games, there are
    some real issues about pricing and risk management, which Lewis was oblivious
    to in his brief career there.

  zh: 我还记得很久以前当我读了《骗子的扑克牌》，我觉得，好书，但错了。也就是说，对于迈克尔·刘易斯坚持描绘人物、富有名人的轶事以及他主修的艺术史而言，他做得很好。但当他对经济学进行演绎时，如，一切都建立在炒作上，或者每个人都是大忽悠时，这在相当程度上是夸大其词，而程度最终是重要的。这并不是所有的BSD们在玩牛仔游戏，关于价格和风险管理还涉及一些真正的问题，而刘易斯对此一无所知。

- en: in Portfolio.com notes that the subprime mess is because...Black-Scholes is
    wrong! I worked with some guys who thought Black-Scholes was wrong, and would
    write papers to journals, and didn't get any traction. The key is, it is not 'wrong'.
    It has been proved several independent ways. It is--sacre blue!--based on incorrect
    assumptions, and since day one, people have been addressing what happens when
    this assumption is changed, etc. Models are always wrong, sometimes useful. Lewis
    doesn't really understand finance, which is why he would be shocked to know that
    people were layering B-S with outside the box adjustments before he went to college.
    But even if Black-Scholes is predicated on the idea than you can sell a stock
    at its price, and this is wrong (er, so the price is not a price?), what the heck
    does that have to do with subprime? The subprime mess was about as related to
    Black-Scholes as the Dividend discount model, or the Miller-Modigliani theorem,
    or Fisher's breakdown of the interest rate into a real rate and inflation expectations.
    They all involve numbers, finance even, but not really the same. If they were
    relatives, they would be 'third cousins once removed'.

  zh: 在 Portfolio.com 上指出次贷混乱的原因是...布莱克-舒尔斯(BS)错了！我曾和一些人合作，他们认为布莱克-舒尔斯是错的，他们会向期刊投稿论文，但得不到任何回应。关键是，它并不是'错'。它有几个独立的证明。这是——天哪！——基于错误的假设，自从一开始，人们一直在考虑当这个假设改变时会发生什么，等等。模型总是错的，有时会有用。刘易斯并不真正了解金融，这就是他会惊讶地得知人们在他上大学之前，就在布莱克-舒尔斯的基础上进行了非常规的调整。但即使布莱克-舒尔斯是建立在你可以以价格出售股票的想法上的，而这是错误的（嗯，这样价格就不是价格了？），那跟次贷有什么关系呢？次贷混乱与布莱克-舒尔斯关系不大，就像股利折现模型，米勒-莫迪格里尼定理或费希尔把利率分解为实际利率和通货膨胀预期那样。它们都涉及数字，甚至涉及金融，但实际上并不一样。如果它们是亲戚，它们将是'三代表兄弟'。
