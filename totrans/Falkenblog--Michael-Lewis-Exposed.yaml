    That is, to the extent Michael Lewis stuck to personalities, anecdotes about the
    rich and famous, and allusions to his major of art history, he was great. When
    he made riffs on economics, such as, that it's all based on hype, or everyone
    is a big faker, it was an overstatement to a considerable degree, and degree is
    ultimately important. It's not all a game of BSDs playing macho games, there are
    some real issues about pricing and risk management, which Lewis was oblivious
    to in his brief career there.

- en: in Portfolio.com notes that the subprime mess is because...Black-Scholes is
    wrong! I worked with some guys who thought Black-Scholes was wrong, and would
    write papers to journals, and didn't get any traction. The key is, it is not 'wrong'.
    It has been proved several independent ways. It is--sacre blue!--based on incorrect
    assumptions, and since day one, people have been addressing what happens when
    this assumption is changed, etc. Models are always wrong, sometimes useful. Lewis
    doesn't really understand finance, which is why he would be shocked to know that
    people were layering B-S with outside the box adjustments before he went to college.
    But even if Black-Scholes is predicated on the idea than you can sell a stock
    at its price, and this is wrong (er, so the price is not a price?), what the heck
    does that have to do with subprime? The subprime mess was about as related to
    Black-Scholes as the Dividend discount model, or the Miller-Modigliani theorem,
    or Fisher's breakdown of the interest rate into a real rate and inflation expectations.
    They all involve numbers, finance even, but not really the same. If they were
    relatives, they would be 'third cousins once removed'.
