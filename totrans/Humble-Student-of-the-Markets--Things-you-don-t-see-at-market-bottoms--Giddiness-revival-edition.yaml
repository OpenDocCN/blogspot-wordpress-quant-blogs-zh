- en: The last time I published a post in a series of "things you don't see at market
    bottoms" based on US based investor enthusiasm was in January. That's because
    market exuberance had significantly moderated since the January top. Guess, what,
    the giddiness is baack!

    Translated, markets bottom out when panic sets in, and therefore they can be more
    easily identifiable. By contrast, market tops form when a series of conditions
    come together, but not necessarily all at the same time. My experience has shown
    that overly bullish sentiment should be viewed as a condition indicator, and not
    a market timing tool.

    should be aware of the risks where sentiment is getting increasingly frothy.
