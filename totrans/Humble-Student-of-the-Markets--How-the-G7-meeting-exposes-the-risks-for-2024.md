# Humble Student of the Markets: How the G7 meeting exposes the risks for 2024

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2023/05/how-g7-meeting-exposes-risks-for-2024.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2023/05/how-g7-meeting-exposes-risks-for-2024.html#0001-01-01)

Two weeks ago I highlighted how history shows that the stock market only bottomed after recessions have begun (see

[How to spot the stock market bottom](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2023/05/06/how-to-spot-the-stock-market-bottom/)

) and a recession is likely on the way in H2 2023\. If that is the case, U.S. equities should bottom at some point this year and a recovery should be in full swing by 2024. 

However, the agenda of G7 Summit in Hiroshima highlights the geopolitical risks to the 2024 recovery and the threat to global growth in 2024 and beyond.
