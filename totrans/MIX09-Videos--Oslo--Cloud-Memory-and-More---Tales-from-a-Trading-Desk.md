## MIX09 Videos, Oslo, Cloud Memory and¬†More

Tonight is one of those nights where I finally get around to reading various blog postings that I‚Äôve starred in Google Reader. So here goes some thoughts on the various postings:

*   MIX09 videos ‚Äì definitely worth a watch, especially the [Blend 3](http://blogs.msdn.com/janete/archive/2009/03/20/view-the-expression-blend-sessions-videos-from-mix09.aspx) segments üôÇ Actually, just watch everything üôÇ The Azure [sessions](http://msdnrss.thecoderblogs.com/2009/03/22/windows-azure-mix-videos/) I mostly skip watched since I general knew what was coming. 10 way to ensure RIA [Failure](http://videos.visitmix.com/MIX09/C06F) üòâ Probably worth a watch by a few companies.
*   [James](http://codebetter.com/blogs/james.kovacs/archive/2009/03/20/msdn-magazine-series-from-web-dev-to-ria-dev.aspx) asks for thoughts on his up and coming MSDN Magazine Series: From Web Dev to RIA Dev. I‚Äôd like to see a trading application used as an example. Usually magazine articles and blogs use the shopping card boring CRUD style applications, which to be honest just don‚Äôt deal with real-time data and mass updates, coupled with transactions in real-time. So I guess I fail on the ‚Äú‚ÄúClassic‚Äù ASP.NET Applications‚Äù point, but I‚Äôd like to see push data dealt with from a ‚ÄúTopic‚Äù perspective.
*   I‚Äôm a geek for reading (and finding interesting) [this](http://blogs.msdn.com/surface/archive/2009/03/14/how-did-wpf-become-the-primary-platform-for-surface.aspx) type of background information on Microsoft projects ‚Äì Surface
*   Azure white papers [here](http://blogs.msdn.com/wriju/archive/2009/03/12/azure-services-white-papers.aspx)
*   I‚Äôve found over recent months that High Scalability offers a decent RSS to pick up Cloud articles. Lew Tucker ‚Äì Virtual Data Centers in the [Open Cloud](http://highscalability.com/scalability-perspectives-6-lew-tucker-virtual-data-centers-open-cloud) and Are Cloud Based Memory Architectures the Next Big [Thing](http://highscalability.com/are-cloud-based-memory-architectures-next-big-thing) being two such articles that are probably worth a quick read
*   VS [2010](http://blogs.msdn.com/kirillosenkov/archive/2009/03/13/visual-studio-2010-screencast-c-4-0-language-ide-wpf-shell-editor.aspx) look like it‚Äôs going to be a cool release ‚Äì as almost every next release of VS does üôÇ Drag-Drop data binding for [WPF](http://blogs.msdn.com/vsdata/archive/2008/11/08/drag-drop-data-binding-for-wpf-by-milind-lele.aspx) is just one of the features we can expect. Will VS 2010 + Blend 3 finally provides us with a dream tool set?
*   [MService](http://www.douglaspurdy.com/2009/03/20/mservice-a-dsl-for-restful-services/) begins to make Oslo interesting
*   [SilverlightSpy](http://silverlightspy.com/silverlightspy/) == [FlexSpy](http://www.infoq.com/news/2008/02/flexspy)?
*   Given .NET RIA Services is [build on](http://blogs.msdn.com/brada/archive/2009/03/19/what-is-net-ria-services.aspx) ADO.NET Data Services and WCF, [ADO.NET Data Services Friendly Feeds , Mapping CLR Types](http://msdnrss.thecoderblogs.com/2009/03/21/adonet-data-services-friendly-feeds-mapping-clr-types/) is probably worth a read.
*   There have been a number of WCF postings over the last few weeks that have caught my eye: [WCFMock](http://weblogs.asp.net/cibrax/archive/2009/03/08/wcfmock-a-mocking-framework-for-wcf-services.aspx), [Tracing](http://msdnrss.thecoderblogs.com/2009/03/21/wcf-end-to-end-tracing/) and WCF with [F#](http://blogs.tedneward.com/2009/01/24/Building+WCF+Services+With+F+Part+2.aspx)
*   [Resources](http://geekswithblogs.net/hoarked/archive/2009/02/04/creating-a-wpf-application-with-prism-v2-ndash-browse-module.aspx) always appear to be a pain in WPF land
*   If you happen to want to run some existing analytics code in Azure, you might find this posting [helpful](http://msdnrss.thecoderblogs.com/2009/03/20/using-a-32bit-native-dll-in-windows-azure/)
*   More M-V-VM ‚Äì [Ocean](http://karlshifflett.wordpress.com/mvvm/)
*   I agree with [WPF Wonderland](http://wpfwonderland.wordpress.com/2009/03/24/new-wpf-themes-released/), we need a community site where designers can display their templates for WPF/Silverlight controls and others can peruse the catalog looking for design ideas and samples. As I blogged previously, Microsoft should do this, and get their best design agency involved!
*   [Slidentity](http://blogs.msdn.com/mharsh/archive/2009/03/18/silverlight-3-beta-sample-slidentity-presentation-creation-app.aspx) shows off Silverlight 3 features
