- en: A friend of mine runs a small bank. He said the regulators came in, and said
    that they had too much money invested in brokered deposits. Like any businessman
    he wanted a spotless review, because any negative marks could imply he could not
    do certain things, such as expand a new office, acquire or be acquired. Bad reviews
    give the government an undefined option to meddle, veto, who knows? So he asked,
    what level would be alright with you Fed guys? They said, 'that's a business decision".
    My business friend noted they were very clear that they do not give advice or
    anything that could be construed as advice.

  zh: 我有一个朋友经营一家小银行。他说监管者来了，表示他们在经纪存款方面投入的资金太多。像任何生意人一样，他希望获得一个毫无瑕疵的审查，因为任何负面评价可能意味着他不能做某些事情，比如扩张新办事处、收购或被收购。不良的评价给了政府一个不明确的干预选择，否决权，谁知道呢？所以他问，你们联邦的人认为哪个水平对你们来说可以接受？他们说，“那是一个商业决策”。我的生意朋友注意到他们非常清楚地表示他们不会提供建议或任何可能被解释为建议的东西。

- en: This is government in action, afraid to make any hard decisions. They just want
    to s be invited to the boardroom during large corporate events, like some clueless
    executive eager to seem relevant by being at all the key meetings. They do have
    a veto power, enough so that people won't laugh at them, but they so fear screwing
    up, they won't apply it (except with hindsight, where they will be laser-focused
    on investments that went down).

  zh: 这就是政府的行动，害怕做出任何艰难的决定。他们只是希望在大型企业活动的董事会会议中被邀请，就像一些毫无头绪的高管渴望在所有关键会议上显得重要。他们确实拥有否决权，足以让人们不会嘲笑他们，但他们非常害怕搞砸，所以不会使用它（除非事后，他们会过分关注那些投资下滑的地方）。
