- en: After the first week at my new client, I have a burning desire to learn more
    about the Scrum world and apply it to the client. I found out that Yahoo Groups
    has a group called 'scrumdevelopment', and I have aggregated their feeds to RSSBandit.

  zh: 在新客户处待了第一周后，我迫切希望了解更多关于敏捷开发的知识，并将其应用于客户项目中。我发现Yahoo Groups有一个名为“scrumdevelopment”的小组，我已经将他们的动态聚合到了RSSBandit中。
- en: I admit that I am new to Scrum. As a development manager, I had always practiced
    an XP-style of development. Fast iterations, constant feedback, daily meetings,
    etc. But never the kind of communistic approach that Scrum encourages.

  zh: 我承认我对敏捷开发方法还很陌生。作为一个开发经理，我一直实践的是一种XP式的开发方式。快速迭代，持续反馈，每日会议等等。但从未像敏捷开发方法鼓励的那种共产主义式的方法。

  zh: 在来到Finetix之前，我听说过两件关于敏捷开发方法的事情。
- en: 1) Scrum is having a hard time being adopted by Wall Street companies.

  zh: 1) 敏捷开发方法在华尔街公司很难被采用。
- en: 2) Scrum is much better suited to new development than to enhancing an existing
    project.

  zh: 2) 敏捷开发方法更适合新的开发项目，而不是对现有项目进行增强。
- en: There are two reasons why I see an issue with Scrum and Wall Street companies.
    First, the inability to commit a team to a Scrum without distractions from anyone
    outside the team. It is difficult to dislodge a team from attending to daily production
    problems. It is difficult to tell a revenue-producing trader to leave a team alone
    while they are in the midst of a sprint. It is hard to tell a team member to skip
    all of the various classes that they are signed up for.

  zh: 我认为敏捷开发方法（Scrum）与华尔街公司存在问题的原因有两个。首先，团队难以全身心地投入到敏捷开发中，因为会受到团队外部的干扰。很难让一个团队摆脱日常生产问题的困扰。很难告诉一个创造收入的交易员在团队忙于迭代开发时不要打扰他们。很难告诉一个团队成员放弃他们报名的各种课程。
- en: The second reason is more important. In case you have not heard, Wall Street
    gives amazing bonuses. And, bonuses are usually ties to individual accomplishments.
    The tenure of a developer at a Wall Street company is a relatively short stay,
    and you had better believe that a developer wants to load a resume up with as
    much individualism as possible.

  zh: 第二个原因更为重要。如果你还没听说过，华尔街的奖金非常丰厚。而且，奖金通常与个人的成就挂钩。在华尔街公司，开发人员的任职期相对较短，你最好相信一个开发人员想要在简历上尽可能多地展示个人主义。
- en: As far as the issue of using Scrum for existing projects, how do you dislodge
    a team from support issues on the existing product? How can you have them concentrate
    on new development when a trader is calling you, screaming about a feature that
    is broken?

  zh: 至于在现有项目中使用敏捷开发的问题，你如何让一个团队从现有产品的支持问题中摆脱出来？当一个交易员打电话给你，大声抱怨某个功能坏了时，你怎么能让他们专注于新的开发？
- en: One nice thing is that our manager is very enthusiastic about Scrum. It has
    worked nicely for a Finetix team in London, but they have been doing new development.

  zh: 好消息是，我们的经理对敏捷开发方法非常热情。对于伦敦的一支Finetix团队来说，这种方法效果不错，但他们一直在进行新的开发。
- en: I have a lot to learn about Scrum. The people at Finetix will be amazingly useful
    in helping adapt to this new way of thinking. I am all ears! And, if it is successful
    with my project, then perhaps it can be used on my wife's project as well, where
    she has run into the exact scenario as I have with my new client.

  zh: 我对敏捷开发有很多需要学习的地方。Finetix的人对帮助我适应这种新思维方式将会非常有用。我洗耳恭听！如果它成功应用到我的项目中，那么也许它也可以用在我妻子的项目上，她遇到了我在新客户项目中遇到的相同情况。
