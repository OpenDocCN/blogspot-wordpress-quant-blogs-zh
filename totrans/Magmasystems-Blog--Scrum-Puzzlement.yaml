- en: After the first week at my new client, I have a burning desire to learn more
    about the Scrum world and apply it to the client. I found out that Yahoo Groups
    has a group called 'scrumdevelopment', and I have aggregated their feeds to RSSBandit.

- en: I admit that I am new to Scrum. As a development manager, I had always practiced
    an XP-style of development. Fast iterations, constant feedback, daily meetings,
    etc. But never the kind of communistic approach that Scrum encourages.

- en: 1) Scrum is having a hard time being adopted by Wall Street companies.

    project.

- en: There are two reasons why I see an issue with Scrum and Wall Street companies.
    First, the inability to commit a team to a Scrum without distractions from anyone
    outside the team. It is difficult to dislodge a team from attending to daily production
    problems. It is difficult to tell a revenue-producing trader to leave a team alone
    while they are in the midst of a sprint. It is hard to tell a team member to skip
    all of the various classes that they are signed up for.

- en: The second reason is more important. In case you have not heard, Wall Street
    gives amazing bonuses. And, bonuses are usually ties to individual accomplishments.
    The tenure of a developer at a Wall Street company is a relatively short stay,
    and you had better believe that a developer wants to load a resume up with as
    much individualism as possible.

- en: As far as the issue of using Scrum for existing projects, how do you dislodge
    a team from support issues on the existing product? How can you have them concentrate
    on new development when a trader is calling you, screaming about a feature that
    is broken?

    worked nicely for a Finetix team in London, but they have been doing new development.

- en: I have a lot to learn about Scrum. The people at Finetix will be amazingly useful
    in helping adapt to this new way of thinking. I am all ears! And, if it is successful
    with my project, then perhaps it can be used on my wife's project as well, where
    she has run into the exact scenario as I have with my new client.
