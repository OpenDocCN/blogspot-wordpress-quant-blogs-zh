## Thoughts from the¬†Snow

Having avoided reading any email/blogs for the last few days whilst on vacation I thought I‚Äôd spend a little time tonight while sitting in front of the fire and away from the snow (Norway) and catch up on the 1000‚Äôs of emails Google Reader postings. What follows is a list of some of the things I‚Äôve read, together with comments were appropriate:

*   Velocity reaches [CTP3](http://blogs.msdn.com/velocity/archive/2009/04/08/announcing-velocity-ctp3.aspx) ‚Äì I‚Äôm glad Microsoft has got cache notification into Velocity. Maybe they should consider adding Velocity to Azure ‚Äì Microsoft Data Fabric?
*   [Above the Clouds](http://berkeleyclouds.blogspot.com/) ‚Äì Subscribed. Presentation available [here](http://cid-84f3c5ef51d06e8b.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/.Public/2009/Above-the-Clouds-090401k.pptx)
*   Goldman Sachs [blog](http://www.goldmansachs666.com/) (via [Slashdot](http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=09/04/11/2152251&from=rss))
*   Some thoughts on [Java 7](http://tech.puredanger.com/2009/04/11/what-java-7-will-mean-to-you/)
*   WCF Azure [Samples](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/wcfazure) ‚Äì the [SilverlightChat](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/wcfazure) sample is worth a look, its unfortunate that it‚Äôs not pushed by the .NET Service Bus üò¶ I hoping [Clemens Vasters](http://vasters.com/clemensv) excellent postings on the .NET Service Bus will shed some light on using Silverlight as a client to the .NET Service Bus ‚Äì e.g. how to request a token (cross domain).
*   Silverlight stuff ‚Äì [Spy](http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/Continuum/SilverlightSpy/), [SLOOB vs. AIR](http://simpable.com/software/sloob-vs-air/), style [enhancements](http://www.wintellect.com/CS/blogs/jprosise/archive/2009/04/08/silverlight-3-s-new-style-enhancements.aspx) and [SEO](http://msdnrss.thecoderblogs.com/2009/03/26/silverlight-3-and-seo/)
*   [Montrusco Bolton Investments](https://www.visualwebgui.com/Gizmox/Showcases/tabid/358/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/531/Trading-Desk-applications-UI-completed-in-a-couple-of-weeks.aspx) turns to [Visual WebGui](http://www.visualwebgui.com/) to [migrate](http://geekswithblogs.net/Webgui/archive/2009/04/05/completing-a-trading-desk-applications-ui-in-a-few-weeks.aspx) a VB 6 application to the web ‚Äì shame the screen shot provided shows one ugly application, they need to hire UX fast!
*   Brad [blogs](http://blogs.msdn.com/brada/archive/2009/04/03/link-round-up-on-net-ria-services-march-3rd.aspx) a few .NET RIA Services links
*   Amazon Elastic [MapReduce](http://www.thecepblog.com/2009/04/02/real-cep-news-amazon-announces-elastic-mapreduce/) ‚Äì although well blogged by other people, I‚Äôm more interested in when a CEP vendor (Aleri?) will jump on the EC2 bandwagon
*   Rhino [Security](http://weblogs.asp.net/arturtrosin/archive/2009/04/02/rhino-tools-rhino-security-guide.aspx)
*   Task Parallel Library beta 1 [details](http://blogs.msdn.com/pfxteam/archive/2009/04/06/9534426.aspx)
