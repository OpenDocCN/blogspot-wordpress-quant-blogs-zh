    uncertainty comes from. It is not all inevitable, it is not just that this is
    the way the world works. It is also the creation of those in the market, created
    because that is how those in the market make their money. That is, the markets
    are difficult to model, whether with the methods of physics or anything else,
    because those in the market make their money by having it difficult to model,
    or, more generally, difficult for others to anticipate and do as well.

    They are systems based on creating an informational advantage, on gaming, on action
    and strategic reaction, in a space without well structured rules or defined possibilities.
    There is feedback to undo whatever is put in place, to neutralize whatever information
    comes in.

    will build a physics-based model that includes feedback. I do that all the time”.
    The problem is that the feedback in the markets is designed specifically not to
    fit into a model, to be obscure, stealthy, coming from a direction where no one
    is looking. That is, the Knightian uncertainty is endogenous. You can’t build
    in a feedback or reactive model, because you don’t know what to model. And if
    you do know – by the time you know – the odds are the market has changed.

    misrepresents what physicists -- the ones doing good work, at least -- are trying
    to do in modeling markets. Indeed, I think it's fair to say that much of the work
    in what I call the physics of finance starts from the key observation that "feedback
    in the markets is designed specifically not to fit into a model, to be obscure,
    stealthy, coming from a direction where no one is looking." The best work in no
    way hopes to wrap up everything in one final tidy equation (as in the cartoon
    version of physics, although very little real physics works like this), or even
    one final model solved on a computer, but to begin teasing out -- with a variety
    of models of different kinds -- the kinds of things that can happen and might
    be expected to happen in markets dense with interacting, intelligent and adaptive
    participants who are by nature highly uncertain and trying to go in directions
    no one has gone before.

- en: (still a pre-print) by Bence Toth and other physicists. It's a fascinating and
    truly novel effort to tackle in a fundamental way the long-standing mystery of
    market impact -- the widely observed empirical regularity that a market order
    of size V causes the price of an asset to rise or fall in proportion (roughly)
    to the square root of V. The paper doesn't start from the old efficient markets
    idea that all information is somehow rapidly reflected in market prices, but rather
    tries to actually model how this process takes place. It begins with the recognition
    that when an investor has valuable information, they don't just go out and release
    it to the market in one big trade. To avoid the adverse effects of market impact
    -- your buying drives the price up so you have to buy at ever higher prices --
    those with large orders typically break them up into lots of pieces and try to
    disguise their intentions and reduce market impact. As a result, the market isn't
    at all a place where all information rapidly becomes evident. Most of the trading
    is being driven by people trying to hide their information and keep it private
    as long as possible.

- en: In particular, as Toth and colleagues argue, the sharp rise of market impact
    for very small trades (the infinite slope of the square root form at the origin)
    suggests a view very different from the standard one. Many people take the concave
    form of the observed impact function, gradually becoming flatter for larger trades,
    as reflecting some kind of saturation of the impact for large volumes. Perhaps.
    But the extremely high impact of small trades is perhaps a more interesting phenomenon.
    The square root form in fact implies that the "susceptibility" of the market --
    the marginal price change induced per unit of market order -- heads toward infinity
    in the limit of zero trade size. A singularity of this kind in physics or engineering
    generally signals something special -- a point where the linear response of the
    system (reflecting outcomes in direct proportion to the size of their causes)
    breaks down. The market lives in a highly unstable state.

- en: Toth and colleagues go on to show that this form can be understood naturally
    as arising from a critical shortage of liquidity -- that is, a perpetual scarcity
    of available small volume trades at the best prices. I won't get into the details
    here (as I will return to the topic in greater detail soon), but their model depends
    crucially on the idea that much information remains "latent" or hidden in the
    market, and only gets revealed over long timescales. It remains hidden precisely
    because market participants don't want to give it away and incur undue costs associated
    with market impact. The upshot -- although this needs further study to flesh out
    details -- is that this perpetual hiding of information, and the extreme market
    sensitivity it gives rise to for small trades, might well lie behind the surprising
    frequency with which markets experience relatively large movements up or down,
    apparently without any cause.

    Indeed, some of the best models in either theoretical ecology or evolutionary

    than anyone else. Rather, just that physicists have inherited a very rich modeling
    culture and tools -- developed in statistical physics over the past few decades
    -- that are incredibly powerful. If there is physics envy  in finance -- and Bookstaber
    asserts there is -- it's only a problem because the wrong model of physics is
    being envied. Forget the elegant old equation based physics of quantum field theory.
    Nothing like that is going to be of much help in understanding markets. Think
