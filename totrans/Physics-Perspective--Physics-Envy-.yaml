    will build a physics-based model that includes feedback. I do that all the time”.
    The problem is that the feedback in the markets is designed specifically not to
    fit into a model, to be obscure, stealthy, coming from a direction where no one
    is looking. That is, the Knightian uncertainty is endogenous. You can’t build
    in a feedback or reactive model, because you don’t know what to model. And if
    you do know – by the time you know – the odds are the market has changed.

- en: I think this is an important and perceptive observation, yet it also strongly
    misrepresents what physicists -- the ones doing good work, at least -- are trying
    to do in modeling markets. Indeed, I think it's fair to say that much of the work
    in what I call the physics of finance starts from the key observation that "feedback
    in the markets is designed specifically not to fit into a model, to be obscure,
    stealthy, coming from a direction where no one is looking." The best work in no
    way hopes to wrap up everything in one final tidy equation (as in the cartoon
    version of physics, although very little real physics works like this), or even
    one final model solved on a computer, but to begin teasing out -- with a variety
    of models of different kinds -- the kinds of things that can happen and might
    be expected to happen in markets dense with interacting, intelligent and adaptive
    participants who are by nature highly uncertain and trying to go in directions
    no one has gone before.

- en: (still a pre-print) by Bence Toth and other physicists. It's a fascinating and
    truly novel effort to tackle in a fundamental way the long-standing mystery of
    market impact -- the widely observed empirical regularity that a market order
    of size V causes the price of an asset to rise or fall in proportion (roughly)
    to the square root of V. The paper doesn't start from the old efficient markets
    idea that all information is somehow rapidly reflected in market prices, but rather
    tries to actually model how this process takes place. It begins with the recognition
    that when an investor has valuable information, they don't just go out and release
    it to the market in one big trade. To avoid the adverse effects of market impact
    -- your buying drives the price up so you have to buy at ever higher prices --
    those with large orders typically break them up into lots of pieces and try to
    disguise their intentions and reduce market impact. As a result, the market isn't
    at all a place where all information rapidly becomes evident. Most of the trading
    is being driven by people trying to hide their information and keep it private
    as long as possible.

  zh: （仍然是一个预印本）由Bence Toth和其他物理学家撰写。这是一项尝试从根本上解决市场影响长期谜团的努力——广泛观察到的经验规律是，市场规模V的市场订单导致资产价格上升或下降，大致与V的平方根成比例。这篇论文并不是从有效市场的老观念出发，认为所有信息都以某种方式迅速反映在市场价格中，而是试图实际建模这个过程是如何进行的。它从认识到当投资者拥有有价值的信息时开始，他们并不会只是出去，一次性释放到市场中。为了避免市场影响的负面影响——你的购买推动价格上涨，所以你必须以越来越高的价格购买——那些有大量订单的人通常会将其分解成许多部分，并试图隐藏他们的意图，减少市场影响。结果是，市场绝不是所有信息迅速显现的地方。大多数交易都是由试图隐藏信息并尽可能长时间保持私密的人驱动的。
- en: In particular, as Toth and colleagues argue, the sharp rise of market impact
    for very small trades (the infinite slope of the square root form at the origin)
    suggests a view very different from the standard one. Many people take the concave
    form of the observed impact function, gradually becoming flatter for larger trades,
    as reflecting some kind of saturation of the impact for large volumes. Perhaps.
    But the extremely high impact of small trades is perhaps a more interesting phenomenon.
    The square root form in fact implies that the "susceptibility" of the market --
    the marginal price change induced per unit of market order -- heads toward infinity
    in the limit of zero trade size. A singularity of this kind in physics or engineering
    generally signals something special -- a point where the linear response of the
    system (reflecting outcomes in direct proportion to the size of their causes)
    breaks down. The market lives in a highly unstable state.

  zh: 特别是，如Toth和同事们所论述，非常小交易的市场影响（在原点的平方根形式的无限斜率）暗示了一种与标准观点截然不同的看法。许多人认为观察到的市场影响函数的凹面形式，在大交易时逐渐变得更平坦，反映了大量交易对市场影响的某种饱和。也许如此。但小交易极高的市场影响或许是一个更有趣的现象。实际上，平方根形式意味着市场“易感性”——每单位市场订单引起的边际价格变化——在交易量趋近于零时趋于无穷大。在物理学或工程学中，这种类型的奇点通常意味着一些特别的东西——系统线性响应（反映结果与原因大小成比例）崩溃的点。市场处于一种高度不稳定的状态。
- en: Toth and colleagues go on to show that this form can be understood naturally
    as arising from a critical shortage of liquidity -- that is, a perpetual scarcity
    of available small volume trades at the best prices. I won't get into the details
    here (as I will return to the topic in greater detail soon), but their model depends
    crucially on the idea that much information remains "latent" or hidden in the
    market, and only gets revealed over long timescales. It remains hidden precisely
    because market participants don't want to give it away and incur undue costs associated
    with market impact. The upshot -- although this needs further study to flesh out
    details -- is that this perpetual hiding of information, and the extreme market
    sensitivity it gives rise to for small trades, might well lie behind the surprising
    frequency with which markets experience relatively large movements up or down,
    apparently without any cause.

  zh: Toth和同事们进一步表明，这种形式可以自然地理解为源于流动性的一种临界短缺——即，在最佳价格处永久性地缺少小成交量交易。我在这里不详细说明（因为我会很快详细讨论这个话题），但他们的模型关键依赖于这样一个想法：市场中很多信息保持“潜在”或隐藏状态，并且只有在长时间尺度上才会被揭示。它之所以保持隐藏，正是因为市场参与者不想透露它，从而招致与市场影响相关的额外成本。结果是——尽管这需要进一步研究以完善细节——这种信息的永久隐藏，以及它对小交易造成的极端市场敏感性，可能正是市场经历相对大范围上下波动的惊人频率背后的原因，而这种波动看起来没有原因。
