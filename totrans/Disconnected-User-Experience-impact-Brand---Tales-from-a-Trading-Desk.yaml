- en: Many companies are looking to improve the digital brand by extending their digital
    footprint.  Companies offering a number of services can often be seen to have
    a disconnected experience between geographic locations and services.  As companies
    look to improve their online experience, they need to keep in mind that a consistent
    experience irrespective of country is important to the brand image, and that the
    larger the different in experiences by country, the more a users is confused due
    to the fact that Google and other search engines allow brand follows to consume
    global content, and compare services.

    is [Porsche](https://www.porsche.com/).  The general web site by country is fairly
    consistent from a flow and navigation perspective.  Its only when you begin to
    drill down into certain features, that the user experience begins to appear inconsistent
    e.g.  Porsche Sport Driving [School](https://www.porsche.com/silverstone/en/experience/psds/)
    (UK) vs Porsche Track [Experience](https://experience.porsche.com/en/track) (global
    site).  Porsche Experience provides the ability to setup an account and track
    your progress though the various driving experiences, the UK Porsche site doesn’t
    provide this, and lacks the depth of information on each experience.  Net out,
    a disconnected experience that fails to engage the user with the Porsche brand
