- en: At the NBER conference, Jonathan Berk of UC Berkeley made a very spirited, but
    unconvincing, defense of the idea that one should evaluate skill, not through
    alpha via an asset pricing model (eg, the Fama French 4 factor model), but rather,
    look at the size of the fund and its fees as evidence of alpha. That is, if a
    firm has edge, in a competitive environment, its edge is equal to its fees. This
    argument is based on competitive markets, and makes some sense. But it implies
    that mutual fund returns, pre-fees and expenses, are correlated with fees and
    expenses. I haven't seen such data.

    impressive guy, he looks, and acts, like an ultimate fighter: aggressive, shaved
    head. He has one of those English accents that''s very distinctive, but as an
    American, I don''t know where it comes from. I just know it''s not like the Queen,
    nor a cockney accent. After that, who knows. I''m sure Englishmen could put him
    in a particular county and social strata.'

    exploited, is observationally equivalent to any overfit, ex post observation.
    Both are merely historical, and though you can come up with a good explanation
    for why making money on internet companies in the 90's after the fact, one could
    easily argue these were merely accidents, unforeseeable. The bottom line is, you
    really can never know, except through a very qualitative evaluation of the motivation.

- en: There was a clear distinction between theorists and empiricists. Theorists merely
    want models. They want something with generalization, something they can extend
    or modify, or else, what are they to do? People want things they can use, and
    so, as an intellectual, this means an idea that is amenable to various refinements.
    There is an interesting contrast between the desire to make something useful pedagogically,
    or useful for refinements, and useful for explaining the data. Sometimes they
    coincide, sometimes they don't.
