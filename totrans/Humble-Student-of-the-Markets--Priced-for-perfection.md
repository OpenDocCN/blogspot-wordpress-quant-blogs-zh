# Humble Student of the Markets: Priced for perfection

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2020/01/priced-for-perfection.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2020/01/priced-for-perfection.html#0001-01-01)

I have been in the habit of writing a weekend publication consisting of a relatively long research piece combined with a tactical trading commentary, which has at times been very long. As an experiment, I am splitting the two up. Please let me know if you prefer the format of two shorter posts, or a combined longer publication.

As the market advanced to another fresh high, the forward P/E rose to 18.4, which roughly matches the level last seen at the melt-up high of early 2018.

From a pure valuation perspective, stock prices have risen too far, too fast. Oliver Renick, writing in

, justified the elevated valuations this way:

> Actually, if there’s anyone for the bears to blame, it’s themselves.

> Economic data in the U.S., China and Eurozone are beating expectations by the biggest gap since early 2018 and on the longest win-streak since mid-2017, according to the sum of Citi’s economic surprise indices I compiled using Bloomberg. Geopolitical risk between the U.S. and China is fading, Brexit is on some path toward completion, a dropping dollar is providing relief to emerging economies, and the global banking system is still intact despite an unnerving foray into the land of negative interest rates. So stocks are rallying as things improve. It’s as simple as that.

Macro concerns have been resolved bullishly, one by one. The reduction of macro risk has compressed risk premiums, and conversely, boosted P/E ratios.

In other words, the market is being priced for perfection.
