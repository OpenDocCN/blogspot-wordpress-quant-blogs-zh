- en: It has been two weeks since Barclays surprised volatility investors by [announcing
    the suspension](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2022/03/barclays-suspends-creation-units-for-vxx.html)
    of new creation units in the popular iPath Series B S&P 500® VIX Short-Term Futures
    ETN ([VXX](https://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX)).  Yesterday, a [Barclays
    press release](https://home.barclays/content/dam/home-barclays/documents/investor-relations/IRNewsPresentations/2022News/20220328-Impact-of%20over-issuance-under-BBPLC-US-Shelf.pdf)
    clarified some of what happened, noting that the firm had issued $15.2 billion
    more in VXX than had been authorized in an August 2019 $20.2 billion shelf registration. 
    Barclays has elected to conduct a rescission offer to eligible purchasers and
    is also dealing with regulatory authorities on this matter.

- en: It is worth noting that VXX is a small part of the $12.7 billion structured
    products business in the United States that Barclays has pledged to continue with. 
    In that respect, the future of VXX is uncertain, but the intent to file a new
    automatic shelf registration “as soon as practicable” is certainly a favorable
    development.

    Ukraine, but for the first time since March 16^(th), the VXX premium relative
    to its [intraday indicative value (IV)](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/intraday%20indicative%20value)
    is down from the previous day, currently at 26.3%, down from yesterday’s 28.5%
    at the close.

- en: As noted previously, the risk for shorts is that the short squeeze will continue
    and maybe even accelerate, perhaps in dramatic fashion, with the VXX premium to
    VXX.IV rising sharply. On the other hand, the risk for longs is that Barclays
    will suddenly announce a new automatic shelf registration and the premium to IV
    will suddenly collapse to zero, as was the case with [TVIX and Credit Suisse back
    in 2012](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2012/03/tvix-creation-units-return-what-it.html).

    options trades are typically the best way to proceed when there is substantial
    “[jump risk](https://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/jump%20risk)” (or overnight
    gap up or gap down risk) in both directions.

    ETN that also had its creation units suspended in conjunction with VXX continues
    to behave relative to its indicative value, currently showing a premium of just
    0.05 over indicative value.
