    for the S&P 500\. That remains my base case scenario for the rest of August. Continuing
    concerns about the Delta variant stalling growth are likely to put downward pressure
    on risk appetite. On the other hand, an improving EPS growth outlook is putting
    a floor on stock prices.

    less than enthusiastic reception to Friday's strong jobs report is indicative
    of the market's internals and makes my case that the stock market is likely to
    be range-bound. On the surface, the S&P 500 advance. Looking under the hood, the
    yield curve steepened and cyclical and value stocks rallied, while growth stocks
    fell.
