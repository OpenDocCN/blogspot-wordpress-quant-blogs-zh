- en: I’m pleased to confirm that you have been nominated to receive a Microsoft®
    Most Valuable Professional (MVP) award as part of the July 2011 award cycle. The
    MVP award and program was created by Microsoft to recognise the best and brightest
    from the technology communities around the world. MVPs are exceptional community
    leaders who come from a wide range of backgrounds; they are teachers, artists,
    doctors, engineers, as well as technologists, who actively share their high-quality,
    real-world technical expertise with the community and with Microsoft. With the
    MVP Award, we thank inspiring individuals that represent the voice of thousands
    in the community through the powerful and independent feedback they give us, and
    for helping our customers maximize the potential of their software.
