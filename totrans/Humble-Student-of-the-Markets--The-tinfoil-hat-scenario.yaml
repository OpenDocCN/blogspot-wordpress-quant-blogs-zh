    of the things I wondered about (I still do) is how/where all the information about
    his emails and phone calls came from. Some of that stuff would have been fairly
    old. That it entered into the picture at all tells me that the FBI has some pretty
    impressive capabilities to be able to retrieve old/deleted stuff — a capability
    that the manager of the Reagan Administration’s email server or Rose Marie Woods
    would have been a bit threatened by. ***The use of such information in what amounted
    to a Washington insider “hit” shows its real purpose: to destroy or intimidate
    or uncover the operations of political opponents or potential political opponents.***'
