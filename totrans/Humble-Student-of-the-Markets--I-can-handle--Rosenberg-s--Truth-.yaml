    and income orientation, whether that be in bonds, hybrids, hedge fund strategies,
    and a consistent focus on reliable dividend growth and dividend yield would seem

    volatility and downside risks as well as to focus on where the secular fundamentals
    are positive such, as in fixed-income and in equity sectors that lever off the
    commodity sector.
