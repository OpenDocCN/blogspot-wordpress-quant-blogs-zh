    bloggers, and service providers. The energy he put towards the blog and the rest
    of his work was astounding. His posts were consistently thought provoking and
    provided many sparks for further research on this site and others. And he’s done
    it with the kind of integrity not often found on Wall St.

    inspiration, support, and encouragement throughout the last few years it certainly

    you to join their firm will surely benefit greatly, just as so many others have
    over the years. While you will soon be silent on the internet, I look forward
    to eventually hearing of the good things you’ll accomplish in the next several
    years.
