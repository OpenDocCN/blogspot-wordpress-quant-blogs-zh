    out of fear for even larger loss. Much of this behavior is governed by fear, rather
    than calculated risk. Smarter traders come in then for the bargains.

    or more consecutive down days are low, resulting in a very limited number of occurrences.
    Low number of occurrences will result in unreliable statistical estimates, so
    I'll stop at 5.

    a tiny edge can be exploited (find a statistical advantage and repeat as often

    strategy.

    a descent 2.2 versus 0.44 for the B&H.  This is actually pretty good!  ( don't
    get too excited though, as I did not account for commision costs, slippage etc

    the world a bit by only counting the *number* of down days, without paying attention
