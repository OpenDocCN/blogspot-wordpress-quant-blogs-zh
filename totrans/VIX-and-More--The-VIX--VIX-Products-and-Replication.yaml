    is out with a post today, [Why I’m Not Worried About VIX Derivatives](http://www.condoroptions.com/index.php/volatility/why-im-not-worried-about-vix-derivatives/),
    in which he reviews some recent FT Alphaville commentary about the difficulty
    in valuing [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures),
    the idiosyncrasies of various VIX-based products, the shortcomings associated
    with a synthetic VIX, and the implications for volatility as an [asset class](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/asset%20class).'

    addressed all of these issues to one degree or another, but seeing some of the
    points being raised by Jared and the FT Alphaville staff, it looks like time to
    take a deeper dive into these issues, some related sidebar issues, and make an
    effort to come up with some sort of unified theory of volatility products. Of
    course I can’t possibly cover all of the space today, but I can at least dive
    in.

    “so low.” Better yet, investors would like to know how low the VIX will go and
    what some reasonable expectations are for the VIX for the balance of 2011.

    SPX historical volatility just over 8 and 100-day SPX HV below 12, the VIX is
    actually a little inflated relative to current measures of realized volatility,
    even factoring in the standard risk premium.
