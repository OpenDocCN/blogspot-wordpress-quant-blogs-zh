- en: Wired had an interesting [article](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/11/fly-eyes/)
    about the successful reverse-engineering of the optic system that allows flies
    to detect motion patterns.   Apparently they don’t fully understand how it works,
    but have codified it as a system of non-linear equations mimicing the “neural
    network” of synapses in the fly’s optic center.   I have not been able to find
    the paper on the web, though have found the abstract.

- en: I have often thought that the first successes in creating an “intelligent” AI
    will be accomplished by mapping the brain and sensory input structure of an existing
    organism;  this as opposed to a new model of knowledge representation and learning.
      The latter is a much harder problem than initially anticipated in the 50’s and
    60’s, and I’m afraid we are no closer to the goal.    I believe our ability to
    read biological neural activity at progressively finer granularity will outpace
    innovation on the AI modeling front.

    individual neuron activity in a vast structure (such as a mammalian brain) OR
    alternatively scan the configuration of neurons.   Speculating as a layman, I
    am going to guess that the amount of noise from the vast number of neighboring
    or enclosing neurons in the 3-dimensional structure would prohibit the extraction
    (isolation) of an individual neuron signal.  If this problem is insurmountable,
    may only leave intrusive / destructive approaches to scanning neural structures.

    to understand the fundamentals that pertain to matter/energy, information, and
    time, mostly at the microscopic or gross macro-level.   With biological systems
    we have a multitude of “state machines” at different levels each of which can
    be understood at some micro-level, but result in emergent behavior that we, as
    of yet, hardly understand.

    explored within the fields of mathematics, engineering, statistics, physics, etc.
      With computing power came a number of innovations in biology and the approach
    to biological systems.    Protein folding, genome analysis, simulation / modeling
    of cellular mechanisms, are just a few of many areas that were previously intractable
    (or at least too complex to fathom without the aid of massive computations).
