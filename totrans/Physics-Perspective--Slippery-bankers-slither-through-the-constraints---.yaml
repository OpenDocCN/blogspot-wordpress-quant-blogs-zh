    troubling fact about recent measures proposed to stop bankers (and CEOs and hedge
    fund managers, etc.) from taking excessive risks which bring them big personal
    profits in the short run while saddling their firms (and taxpayers) with losses
    in the long run. The problem, as economists Peyton Young and Dean Foster

    control on details about how they are running their firms and how they are investing,
    they can always game the system by making it look outwardly to others that they''re
    not taking excessive risks. There''s no way to control it without much greater
    transparency so shareholders or investors can see clearly what strategies executives
    are using.'

    for five years, perhaps, or put in clauses allowing the investor to claw back
    pay if it proves undeserved. But it won't work. Economists Dean Foster of the
    University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia and Peyton Young of the University
    of Oxford have now extended Lo's argument, showing that the problem is simply
    unsolvable as long as investors cannot see the strategies used by managers (

    the risky strategies could explode before the period is up. But a manager willing
    to live with the uncertainty can still profit enormously if they don't. On average,
    managers playing the game still profit from excess risk while sticking the firm
    with the losses.

    the system, will also fail. While sufficiently strong provisions would make it
    unprofitable for managers to game the system, Young and Foster show that such
    provisions would also deter honest managers who actually do possess superior management
    skills. Claw back provisions simply end up driving out the better managers that
    incentives were meant to attract in the first place.

    the matter of pay for performance and the problems it has created. You would think
    it would be front and center in the political process of coming up with new rules,
    but in fact it seems to get almost no attention whatsoever. From

    they believe will limit incentives to take excessive risks. That has led many
    banks to increase fixed salaries, reduce employees’ reliance on annual bonuses
    and defer cash and stock awards over several years.
