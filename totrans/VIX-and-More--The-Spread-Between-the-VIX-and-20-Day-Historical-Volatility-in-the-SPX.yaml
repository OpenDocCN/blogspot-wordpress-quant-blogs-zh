    about the VIX and [historical volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/historical%20volatility)
    in the SPX. For those who may have missed it, you may wish to start with [The
    VIX in the Context of Historical Volatility in the SPX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/10/vix-in-context-of-historical-volatility.html)
    and [The VIX – SPX 30 Day Historical Volatility Spread and Performance](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/11/performance-and-vix-and-spx-30-day.html).

    (VIX – 56.10) from 2 perspectives. First, the VIX continues to trade at a steep
    discount to the SPX''s 20-day historical volatility, which has begun to level
    off just above 80% during the past few weeks. Our interpretation of this development
    is that there is little fear of another major setback in the market. Typically,
    such fear leads to major market bottoms. If fear and panic were elevated, the
    VIX would be trading above the actual volatility of the SPX.*'

    this area is important, as it marked last week''s low, and represents the VIX''s
    "half-high" achieved on October 24\. Moreover, this area is currently home to
    the VIX''s rising 50-day moving average.”*'

    that I wish to comment on here. Starting with some history, since 1990 the VIX
    has traded above the 20 day historical volatility of the SPX over 90.6% of the
    time, often in an uninterrupted fashion for months on end. The fact that the VIX
    is above 20 day historical volatility, therefore, says very little about elevated
    levels of fear and panic.

    in the SPX (expressed as a percentage of the VIX) from 2007 through Friday. In
    the chart, it is evident that when the VIX-HV is high, this generally tends to
    coincide with short-term bottoms in the SPX. The low levels of VIX-HV are not
    as easy to decipher. The two most dramatic VIX-HV lows on the chart both occurred
    after a low in the SPX and coincided with a several month uptrend in the SPX.

    ratio to be a signal that a near-term bottom is in the process of forming. I do
    not, however, see the need for the VIX to trade above the SPX’s 20 day historical
    volatility, as it did for one day on October 27^(th) for instance, to provide
    any confirmation signal.
