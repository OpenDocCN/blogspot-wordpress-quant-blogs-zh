- en: Friday was what I call a mega-outside day. It didn't just make a higher high
    and a lower low (a regular outside day). It actually opened below the low of Thursday
    and closed above the high of Thursday. This is unusual, and in the past it has
    led to a dip over the next few days.

    downside occurring on day 1.
