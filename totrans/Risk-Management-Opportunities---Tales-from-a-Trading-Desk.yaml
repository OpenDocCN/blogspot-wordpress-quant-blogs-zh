    on the risk management opportunities that exist in today’s market.  There are
    a number of key points that Marcus has hit nail on head, in particular:'

- en: “Risk management should be able to communicate both the risk position and the
    risk appetite across the organization – along with risk investigation” – Concur
    with this, but the issue I suspect Marcus is alluding to is that for some organisations
    a consolidate view of risk from an enterprise perspective is still somewhat of
    a challenge.

- en: “correction capacity for the risk analysts has to be built, in a compliant way,
    into the risk architecture” – in many cases this will be new/enhanced functionality
    for a set of investment banks.

- en: “technology must empower the human activity that is risk management” – this
    is probably one of the most important points in Marcus’s posting.  In the classic
    software engineering space, what you don’t want is a risk management solution
    **looking** for a risk management problem.

- en: Clearly Marcus’s is “linking” to SunGuard’s product range in his posting, this
    is to be expected.  However, to Marcus’s very points, an understanding of what
    the risk department business requirements are, coupled with what they have today,
    and the issues with what they have today are paramount prior to deciding on a
    solution, which in many cases maybe be more than buying a package solution off-the-shelf.
