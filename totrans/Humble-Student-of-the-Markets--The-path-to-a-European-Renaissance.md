# Humble Student of the Markets: The path to a European Renaissance

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2019/07/the-path-to-european-renaissance.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2019/07/the-path-to-european-renaissance.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models**

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post,

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The

**Trend Model**

is an asset allocation model which applies trend following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or contraction (bearish)?"

My inner trader uses a

**trading model**

, which is a blend of price momentum (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa). Subscribers receive real-time alerts of model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of the those email alerts are updated weekly

. The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that began in March 2016 is shown below.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Buy equities*
*   Trend Model signal: Neutral*
*   Trading model: Bearish*

**In search of the eurozone buy signal**

I had a number of discussions with readers in the wake of last week's publication, 

[Europe: An ugly duckling about to be a swan](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2019/07/07/europe-an-ugly-duckling-about-to-be-a-swan/)

. The topics revolved mainly around further justification for buying into Europe, when US equities had performed so well in the last 10 years. In short, the questions were:

*   What is the valuation for Europe, and
*   Finding a bullish catalyst for their relative revival.

As to the first question, I offer the following chart from Robeco Asset Management.

The gulf in valuation, as measured by the Cyclically Adjusted P/E ratio (CAPE), provides some clear reasoning for American investors to diversify outside their home country. As well, European stocks look cheap relative to their own history. But that is not the entire story.
