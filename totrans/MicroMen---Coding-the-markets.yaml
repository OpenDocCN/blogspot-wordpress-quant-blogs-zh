    on BBC4 was a powerful blast of nostalgia for the early 80s. Funny, sad and exhilarating
    – the Acorn hack against the clock to build the BBC prototype was fantastic, and
    the Clive Sinclair Mensa sequence is hysterical. I was an undergrad at Cambridge
    in the late eighties, so I was pleased to see them get loads of detail right:
    the Baron of Beef pub, the Computer lab. I used to see Sinclair jogging on the
    Madingley Road on the rare occasions I was out and about before midday…'

    all kinds of peripherals, including a real keyboard and 16K RAM pack. Another
    great point of detail in MicroMen was the reference to the dreaded [RAM pack wobble](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX81#Peripherals_and_expansions)
    that afflicted ZX81s. After the ZX81, I went on to a [Camputers Lynx](http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/2926/Camputers-Lynx-96/),
    also mentioned in MicroMen, and then an [Atari 520](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_ST)
    that I took to college in 86.
