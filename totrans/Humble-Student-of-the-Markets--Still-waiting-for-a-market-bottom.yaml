    question in many investors' minds must be "Have we seen the bottom?" My review
    of some of my market indicators indicate that it’s probably a little early to
    flash the all-clear signal for US equities.

    and brokers, I go back to my rule of thumb that I would like to see a price to
    book ratio of 1 for the investment banks. The P/B of 1x was a good signal of a
    market bottom in the 1974-5 and 1981-2 bear markets.

    Stearns panic, other investment banks and brokers such as Morgan Stanley (MS),
    Merrill Lynch (MER) and Raymond James (RJF), which is an interesting bellwether
    as it has no significant prop trading operations, are trading at valuations of
    1.5 to 1.8 times book. Goldman Sachs (GS) is trading at valuations that are even
    higher than that.

    case in any recession. Rather than looking at the payroll numbers, which are backward
    looking, I prefer to look at market discounting real-time statistics. My proxy
    is the price action of S&P Supercomposite Human Resources and Employment Services,
    consisting mainly of temp and employment agencies. The chart below of these stocks
    relative to the S&P 500 indicate that, like the Homebuilders, the Temp Agencies
    remain in a relative downtrend with no convincing signs of stabilization.
