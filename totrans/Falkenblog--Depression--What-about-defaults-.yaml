    rate for speculative grade securities in the US has not been lower since 1981!
    Who'd a thunk it? [default data from Moody's] I don't things are nearly as bad
    as people think.

    we need to regulate more. I'm not clear what particular regulation he considers
    so useful. The main effects of the 30's regulation on securities markets is basically
    generating greater costs of entry, by mandating lots of silly bureaucratic formalism
    to the extent you promise not to lie, cheat and steal. All the indigent and illiterate
    criminals were now excluded, but that's not much. And separating investment banking
    from commercial banking, did nothing (never adhered to in Europe).

    during the Clinton years. There have been no bank runs, just the failure of a
    few hedge funds and their ilk. This is the wonderful thing about deregulation,
    in that financial excess, and it opposite, have smaller real effects.
