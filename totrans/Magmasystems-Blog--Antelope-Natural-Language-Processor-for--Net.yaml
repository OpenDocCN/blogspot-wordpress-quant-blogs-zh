    How many different semantic meanings does this statement have? Now imagine getting
    a news feed of financial information. How would you parse the news into an ontology
    that equity traders can work with? And how would traders use this information?

    be interested to see if and how these CEP engines can handle news feed. What kind
    of info would they need?
