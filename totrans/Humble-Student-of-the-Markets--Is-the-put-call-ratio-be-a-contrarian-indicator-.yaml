- en: The put-call ratio is primarily used by traders as a contrarian indicator when
    the values reach relatively extreme levels. This means that many traders will
    consider a large ratio a sign of a buying opportunity because they believe that
    the market holds an unjustly bearish outlook and that it will soon adjust, when
    those with short positions start looking for places to cover. There is no magic
    number that indicates that the market has created a bottom or a top, but generally
    traders will anticipate this by looking for spikes in the ratio or for when the
    ratio reaches levels that are outside of the normal trading range.

    my criteria. It does not have a sound theory behind it. As well, the 21 dma equity-only
    put/call ratio has shown limited value as a timing signal. Consider this chart
    of the ratio with the SPX for the last three years.

    a local low and started to rise again. Each signal is marked with a vertical line.
    I have further color coded the lines, where green=the market continued to rise,
    red=market fell and black=market was flat. A glance at the chart shows slightly
    more red lines than green lines, but barely. Even if we were to regard this ratio
    as a black-box indicator, without regard to understanding the theory behind how
    the signal was generated, its record can only be described as weak.

    again. How should the latest signal be interpreted? How much trust should you
    put in an indicator that has little theoretical backing and has shown a spotty
    track record?

- en: From a technical viewpoint, the ebb and flow of the put/call ratio might better
    be described using cycle analysis. The chart below shows some quick and dirty
    cycle analysis by overlaying a 61-day cycle on the put/call ratio. The blue vertical
    lines correspond to highs in the ratio while the red vertical lines correspond
    to the lows of the ratio. An examination of the chart shows that if we were to
    regard the blue lines as buy signals and the red lines as sell signals, the record
    looks reasonable. On the other hand, using the red line as a short signal and
    the blue line as a cover signal seems to be effective.

- en: In conclusion, I would not suggest using the 21 dma of the equity-only put/call
    ratio as a timing tool, largely because it runs counter to the contarian underpinnings
    of the use of put/call ratio. However, technical analysts may use this exercise
    to conduct further research in whether the rise and fall of the 21 dma of this
    ratio is subject to a cycle that might prove to be profitable.
