## LMEstage

LMEstage, a test [environment](http://www.lme.com/en-gb/trading/venues-and-systems/systems/lmestage/) that allows trading strategies to be tested against algorithms in a simulated live market.

> Using custom [algorithms](http://www.finextra.com/news/announcement.aspx?pressreleaseid=54491) that generate order flow, LMEstage enables clients to test their trading strategies and supporting systems in an environment that is similar to, but not identical to, the live market. In addition, the LME can stress the [simulated](http://www.lme.com/~/media/Files/LMEstage/LMEstage%20user%20guide.pdf) market in a variety of ways, for example, by providing strong directional price pressure or high order rates.

With Quantopian and other cloud ago solutions available, its clear there is opportunity for some interesting cloud applications to build on these [cloud](http://www.integral.com/products/fx_cloud.htm) [services](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeremybogaisky/2013/09/04/quants-r-us-algorithmic-trading-trickles-down-to-individual-investors/).
