- en: Can [Marketcetera](http://www.marketcetera.com/) be viable competition for Charles
    River and LatentZero ?  Interesting that their website makes no mention of the
    “sell market data and trading services” strategy that [Matt Asay details](http://blogs.cnet.com/8301-13505_1-9765946-16.html).
    They would appear to be following an interesting variation of classic platform
    strategy a la [Ferguson](http://www.amazon.com/High-Stakes-No-Prisoners-Internet/dp/0812931432).
    Except in this case they’re not commoditising the layers below. They’re attempting
    to commoditise the layer above – the OMS – then lock clients into the layer below
    – the market data and services. It will be interesting to see how they execute
    on this novel strategy.
