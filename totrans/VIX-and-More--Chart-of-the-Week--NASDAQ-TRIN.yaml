- en: The [NASDAQ TRIN](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TRINQ) is an indicator
    I generally hear very little about, yet in a market where technology stocks have
    been leading many of the advances and decline, one that I believes deserves closer
    scrutiny.

- en: In this week's [chart of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week)
    below, I show a simple NASDAQ TRIN chart that uses a 21 day exponential moving
    average to smooth out some of the daily noise that is common in short-term studies
    of this indicator. As a contrarian market sentiment indicator, the TRIN is useful
    for helping to identify market turning points or the potential for near-term reversals.

- en: The chart below shows that since the markets settled down and bottomed in early
    March, the NASDAQ TRIN has been adept at signaling buying points (below the green
    horizontal line) and selling points (above the red horizontal line.) Friday’s
    EMA-smoothed reading of 1.28 is the highest since the mid-May bottom and suggests
    that the current pullback may be another good buying opportunity.

    should make an effort to keep an eye on the NYSE [TRIN](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TRIN)
    (a.k.a. the Arms Index) and the NASDAQ TRIN as market timing signals.
