    recently published an interesting article describing the essence of *generational
    regimes*, summarizing results from the [Barclay Capital 2010 Equity Gilt Study](http://www.barcap.com/egs/)

    understanding generational regimes is crucial for two reasons:'

    as assuming [stationarity and ergodicity](https://quantivity.wordpress.com/2009/07/25/bias-stationarity-ergodicity/)
    across generational regimes is economically nonsensical. Yet, despite this fact,
    methodologies for adjusting quantitative backtesting for generational regimes
    remain an interesting open research question.
