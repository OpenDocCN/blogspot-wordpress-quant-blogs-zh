- en: Backtesting trading strategies necessarily involves a very limited amount of
    historical data. For example, I seldom test strategies with data older than 2007\.
    Gathering longer history may not improve predictive accuracy since the market
    structure may have changed substantially. Given such scant data, it is reasonable
    to question whether the good backtest results (e.g. a high annualized return R)
    we may have obtained is just due to luck. Many academic researchers try to address
    this issue by running their published strategies through  standard statistical
    hypothesis testing.

    strategy. In a display of false modesty, they then suggest that perhaps a null
    hypothesis can produce the same good return R. The null hypothesis may be constructed
    by running the original strategy through some random simulated historical data,
    or by randomizing the trade entry dates. The researchers then proceed to show
    that such random constructions are highly unlikely to generate a return equal
    to or better than R. Thus the null hypothesis is rejected, and thereby impressing
    you that the strategy is somehow sound.'

- en: 'The absurdity of hypothesis testing should be clear. In mathematical terms,
    the probability we are really interested in is the conditional probability that
    the null hypothesis is true given an observed high return R: P(H0|R). But instead,
    the hypothesis test merely gives us the conditional probability of a return R
    given that the null hypothesis is true: P(R|H0). These two conditional probabilities
    are seldom equal.'

    since there are an infinite number of potential H0. Just because you have knocked
    down one particular straw man doesn't say much about your original strategy.

- en: If hypothesis testing is both meaningless and misleading, why do financial researchers
    continue to peddle it? Mainly because this is *de rigueur* to get published. But
    it does serve one useful purpose for our own private trading research. Even though
    a rejection of the null hypothesis in no way shows that the strategy is sound,
    a failure to reject the null hypothesis will be far more interesting.
