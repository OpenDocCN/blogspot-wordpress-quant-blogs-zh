## Post-Trade Blockchain

BNP Paribas [Quintessence](http://securities.bnpparibas.com/quintessence/hot-topics/beyond/bitcoin-and-blockchain-what-you.html#.VZoKzBNVikp)  provide an interesting view on how Blockchain could affect the post-trade world:

1.  Distributed blockchain system allowing all market participants direct access to the DSD (Decentralised Securities Depositary), to the exchange and to the post trade infrastructure (clearing & settlement)
2.  Standardised [post](http://www.coinsetter.com/blog/2015/02/25/coinsetter-unveils-project-high-line/) trade integration – custodians or settlement infrastructures might use the blockchain to record the ownership and trades between themselves.

The BNP Paribas comments come at a time when [Nasdaq](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/81b6145c-0309-11e5-b31d-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3f5JgPHEs) is also trailing blockchain around trade ledger processing.   Its probably also worth [watching](http://www.coindesk.com/former-jp-morgan-exec-blythe-masters-swaps-wall-street-for-bitcoin/) what [comes](http://www.wsj.com/articles/ex-j-p-morgan-cds-pioneer-blythe-masters-to-head-bitcoin-trading-platform-1426048878) out of [Digital Assets](http://www.digitalasset.com/).
