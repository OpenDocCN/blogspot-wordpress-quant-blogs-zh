    so miserably in 2008."

    a diversified portfolio is supposed to give you growth but protect you on the
    downside should something go wrong. Simply put, diversifying between stocks and
    bonds mean that when one thing goes up, the other either stays the same or goes
    down, and vice versa. That way, you get a much steadier rate of return than by
    holding one asset class.

    help that much because both stocks and bonds fell at the same time. The 60/40
    balanced fund portfolio gained a total of 5.8% on an annualized basis from September
    2003 to the present and suffered a maximum drawdown of 35% over that period.

    of the portfolio. At the same time, I constructed a hypothetical portfolio of

    10% over that time. The rest of the time, it had the same returns as the standard
    60/40 benchmark. The modified portfolio returned 7.9% over the same period and
    saw a maximum drawdown of 15%, which is more in line with the expectations of
    a diversified balanced fund.

- en: The failure of diversification is attributable to the increasingly single dimensional
    nature of risk. On a daily basis, we see either the "risk on" or "risk off" trade
    dominating the ticker. When investors buy risk in the "risk on" trade, stocks,
    commodities, the euro and high-yield bonds generally rise together. In a "risk
    off" environment, the US Dollar and bond prices rally.

    is diversifying no longer. Foreign stocks and bonds, particularly if they have
    any form of credit risk aren't diversifying to each other anymore. Neither are
    commodities, nor emerging markets.

    back in the late 1960's and 1970's, when the stock market moved in a broadly sideways
    pattern with but up and down moves. We also saw a similar pattern in the Japanese
    stock market in the last two decades.
