    different reasons. Consider the many reasons people are for abortion or tax cuts.
    People often focus upon those who agree on their goals, and dismiss the reasons
    why as uninteresting details. This has pragmatic merit (Keynes's dictum that 'everything
    is always decided for reasons other than the real merits of the case'), but it
    highlight the tenuous foundation of our beliefs.
