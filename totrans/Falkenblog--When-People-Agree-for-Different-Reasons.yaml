    different reasons. Consider the many reasons people are for abortion or tax cuts.
    People often focus upon those who agree on their goals, and dismiss the reasons
    why as uninteresting details. This has pragmatic merit (Keynes's dictum that 'everything
    is always decided for reasons other than the real merits of the case'), but it
    highlight the tenuous foundation of our beliefs.

    battling to get his radical initiatives implemented in the 1930's. The Supreme
    court presumably constrains the executive and legislative branches based on whether
    their conduct or laws are 'valid'. Very smart people study law to decide whether
    things are 'legal', and then try to convince judges various actions or laws are
    valid.

    supporters of the New Deal. While they disagreed on almost everything (ergo 'scorpions
    in a bottle'), they arrived at similar conclusions through quite varied philosophies.
    William Douglas was results-oriented, Robert Jackson relied on constitutional
    principles, etc. In other words, they all agreed on the answer, just not why it
    was correct.

    and suggest the degree of arbitrariness in the decision. For example, if one person
    doesn''t want to rob me because he fears punishment, another because he thinks
    it is morally wrong, I''m going to try to stay away from the guy whose only fear
    is the police.'

    the landmark desegregation decision, Brown v. Board of Education. He contends
    that their willingness to “break [philosophical] rules of their own,’’ was good
    because they learn the art of politics from FDR. Not only did they all have different
    legal principles, they would break these when convenient, highlighting the profound
    goodness of these men. Well, what if they justified a law you didn't like that
    way? There seems to be a total absence of principle among these legal titans.

    answers, and they've done this with people whose brain's corpus collosum has been

    etc. He likens the conscious confabulator and the unconscious decider of our selves
    to an elephant and its rider. The rider represents the 'controlled' processes
    of the mind, the planning and reasoning that takes place one step at a time in
    conscious awareness, while the elephant represents the hundreds of automatic operations
    we carry out every second outside of conscious awareness. Over time, the rider
    can influence the elephant, but never always, and only so much.

    statistics, they just mean they think their ideas have convincing articulations
    to some people they respect. They are naive if they think that any mildly complex
    idea is unambiguously true according to some unimpeachable proof. There are just
    too many assumptions and implications in any assertion for one to say A is apodictically
    better than B. Sure, you can come up with simple examples of ideas where the alternatives
    are silly, but consider most issues people disagree upon--specific tax rates,
    welfare policies, environmental regulations, criminal statutes--and you will find
    smart, educated persons on both sides of the debate.

    a better world seems like one of those naive beliefs in socialism. The same truths
    would become obvious to everyone. The problem is, you can't teach common sense,
    and even those who have it have idiot-savant status, such as when the brilliant
    surgeon is a conspiracy theorist, or a great labor economist who is a poor macroeconomist.
    I know I have both good and bad ideas, but alas don't know which are which so
    I'm stuck with both. You could say, just don't believe in anything much, but that
    would leave me catatonic, unable to decide the most trivial thing because of the
    infinite reasons for and against anything.

    absolutely nothing at all', meaning, you have to take a risk, assume something
    is true in spite of its unprovability, and act--at least tentatively--otherwise
    you really are in a state of precognition, as when a naive researcher looks at
    a bunch of data without focus, seeing nothing. To focus is to theorize, to form
    model of what is important and how things are measured and interact, and our education
    gives us many tools to do this. But as in geometry where sometimes you assume
    parallel lines meet, sometimes not, so too with all assumptions and criteria,
    and the justification is always somewhat arbitrary.

    important as the having good empirical evidence--eg, the prejudice that risk and
