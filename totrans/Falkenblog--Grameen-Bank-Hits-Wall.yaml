- en: 'in Bangledesh was held out as sort of an anarcho-capitalist dream: small groups
    lending and monitoring borrowers, and making money too boot. Banks are usually
    big, controlled by wealthy parties, but here was a case where the decision makers
    were little people, and historically loss rates were pretty low. Most loans were
    for little amounts like $100, and made to women involved in little home businesses.'

    of joint liability. However, in practice the group members would contribute the
    defaulted amount with an intention of collecting the money from the defaulted
    member at a later time. There was a great deal of invasive monitoring, cajoling,
    and often physical intimidation, but when done informally by friends, was not
    considered oppressive. This clearly would not scale.

- en: The bank has grown a lot in the past 10 years, and the founder, Muhammad Yunus,
    won a Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for this idea. The problem with banking is that
    when borrowers can't pay, there's a political incentive to paint the lender as
    the bad guy and repudiate the debt. The bigger Grameen got, the greater the political
    incentive treat them like a regular bank, as the Bangledeshi Prime Minister recently
    denounced the bank as “

    which was started in 2008 by farmers after some borrowers could not pay their
    debts. Partly as a result of that campaign, a judge recently ordered the liquidation
    of one of the country’s leading microlenders, Banco del Exito.

- en: 'Banks should not be thought of as cookie jars full of money, but rather things
    that manage the savings-investment nexus. They evaluate borrower''s creditworthiness,
    and repossess pledged collateral if payments are not made. If banks simply wrote-off
    every bad loan as opposed to seizing collateral per the original contract, recovery
    rates would be so low the whole industry would have to change, and interest rates
    would rise several fold in anticipation of the higher expected loss rates. Every
    so often the great idea comes up: why not just stop paying the banks? Borrowers
    are invariably more numerous and have less net wealth than the savers. Thus, we
    had the expropriation of the Knights Templar in 1307, several Jewish expulsions
    in the middle ages (Jews specialized as money-lenders), and various communist
    takeovers such when the Khmer Rouge took over Cambodia. In every case, this had
    disastrous effects on the economy.'

  zh: 银行不应被视为装满钱的饼干罐，而应被看作是管理储蓄与投资之间联系的机构。它们评估借款人的信用度，并在未收到还款时收回抵押品。如果银行只是简单地将每笔坏账一笔勾销，而不是按照原始合同收回抵押品，那么回收率将极低，整个行业将不得不改变，预期损失率的提高将导致利率成倍上升。每隔一段时间，就会有人提出一个伟大的想法：为什么不停止向银行还款呢？借款人总是比储蓄者多，且净财富更少。因此，我们看到了1307年圣殿骑士团的没收，中世纪几次犹太人的驱逐（犹太人专门从事放贷），以及各种共产主义接管，例如红色高棉接管柬埔寨。在每一种情况下，这都对经济产生了灾难性的影响。
- en: Surely, if you can't pay back a debt there should be a way to avoid slavery,
    and we have that now, it is called bankruptcy. To simply repudiate loans, as with
    the whole 'robo-signer' pretext, is a naive, populist remedy that has always been
    regretted. The basic problem is, by getting rid of debt you get rid of savings,
    and without savings, you have no investment.

  zh: 当然，如果你无法偿还债务，应该有一种避免沦为奴隶的方式，我们现在有了，那就是破产。简单地拒绝偿还贷款，就像以“机器人签名者”为借口那样，是一种天真的、民粹主义的补救措施，这种做法总是让人后悔。根本问题在于，通过消除债务，你也消除了储蓄，而没有储蓄，就没有投资。
