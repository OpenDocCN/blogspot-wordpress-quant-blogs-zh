- en: In my remarks, ***I will argue that monetary policy faces significant limitations
    as a tool to promote financial stability:*** Its effects on financial vulnerabilities,
    such as excessive leverage and maturity transformation, are not well understood
    and are less direct than a regulatory or supervisory approach; in addition, efforts
    to promote financial stability through adjustments in interest rates would increase
    the volatility of inflation and employment. As a result, ***I believe a macroprudential
    approach to supervision and regulation needs to play the primary role.*** Such
    an approach should focus on "through the cycle" standards that increase the resilience
    of the financial system to adverse shocks and on efforts to ensure that the regulatory
    umbrella will cover previously uncovered systemically important institutions and
    activities. These efforts should be complemented by the use of countercyclical
    macroprudential tools, a few of which I will describe. But experience with such
    tools remains limited, and we have much to learn to use these measures effectively.

    of very low interest rates and low market volatility. And exit is likely to occur
    at different times in different jurisdictions globally, adding to the complexity
    and potential complications. As I emphasized earlier, ***it’s the tail risks –
    the unusual developments – that often pose the greatest threats to financial stability.***
    The question is whether the long period of low rates and low volatility has led
    to a mispricing of risks through reaching for yield, herding, or other types of
    behaviours. If it has, the potential for very sharp adjustments would be higher,
    with possible unanticipated consequences for both borrowers and lenders.
