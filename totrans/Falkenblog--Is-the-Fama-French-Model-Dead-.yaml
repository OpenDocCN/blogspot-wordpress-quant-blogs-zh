    the 1970s. Indeed, if you read those old papers, you will be amazed by how simple

    Fama and French's analysis was simple but the results were too strong to dismiss,
    especially as Fama was not some accounting noob, but rather, someone who understood
    risk and expected returns. Fama and French hypothesized size and value premiums
    implied they proxied risks that affect investors but academics can't measure,
    just as we can see the effects of dark matter but not the dark matter itself.

    has always been used to mask dogmatic thinking. Sophisticates use their superior
    knowledge to out-argue, not find the truth. Complex arguments that are long and
    hard to follow, and have the support of the most other intellectuals are impossible
    to rebut. No one is going to spend a lot of time understanding such arguments
    if they think it's all a waste of time, so everyone who could argue with them
    was a fellow-believer (eg, I originally wanted to be a macroeconomist, but quickly
    discerned it was pointless and so today I cannot give a thorough critique of dominant
    macro models).

    to replicate and test, and this is the best evidence of something that is true
    and important, because things that work tend to be copied over time. They also
    expose dopey reasoning and overfitting, because readers can understand them. Complexity
    does not overcome overfitting, it just hides it better. GMM estimators are rarely
    criticized for overfitting because it's too hard to tell, and when no one is getting
    caught for the world's oldest statistical sin you can be sure it is rampant (eg,
    when the UFC had a steroid problem no one was getting caught).

    proportional to the square root of time, Black-Scholes, or the convexity adjustment

    the fancy methods above.

    to Fama and French's 5.  Overfitting is a perennial problem. Unlike 'big data'
    used by Amazon and Netflix, factor data is orders of magnitude smaller and grows
    very slowly, all the while many thousands of full-time researchers are looking
    at the same data for new patterns. They are all highly motivated to find new,
    better factors, and we all know what happens when you torture the data long enough.
    The simplicity of the 3-factor Fama-French model was not an equilibrium, as this
    invited many to ignore some factors and create their own (even Fama and French
    joined in, adding 2 more). There is now just as much tendentious and disingenuous
    reasoning among the factor promoters as there was with those old opaque and complex
    methods, we have just gotten used to it.

    by having multiple subtle assumptions justified by references to various well-cited
    peer-reviewed articles, each of which itself does the same thing, making it impossible
    to refute because no one has that much time. I have never seen a good argument
    for how these factors help manage risk, but I understand how they are very useful
    in explaining why returns were down last month. Pretentious and parochial jargon
    makes it easier for the common (ie, dumb) risk manager, senior executive, fund

    proxy them.  While no one is suggesting Kalman filters, everyone has some subtle
    twist for their value factor, how to time factors, or their own creation. Failure
    now has led many to reexamine their factors, worried that they either overfit
    their models in the past or would be doing so now by changing them. The risk of
    jumping off a factor just before it rebounds is symmetric to the risk of holding
    on to one that will join price, accruals, and inflation betas in the history dustbin.
