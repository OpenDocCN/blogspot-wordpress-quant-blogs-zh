- en: The SEC should ignore the quid pro quos among institutions, exchanges, and retail
    flow, because for decades exchanges and brokers screwed consumers via their coalition
    on the commissions and spreads, which was encouraged via the regulators. Why trust
    them now? As if the current most prominent regulator, Barney Frank, won't be an
    effective crony capitalist in 9 months, setting an example for all the other current
    regulator big-wigs. The key for them to be valuable is creating barriers to entry,
    as there's no big institution that's going to hire someone good at lowering costs
    to consumers. Of course, that's all hidden behind some pretext about protecting
    against fraud, and helping the stability of the exchanges, and fairness, and lots
    of other platitudes. Just think about whatever the SEC wrote in the 60's and 70's
    and know they were shills for the brokerages and exchanges who colluded to steal
    investors blind via spreads and commissions that never would have survived a competitive
    market (thank you regulators!).

  zh: SEC应该忽略机构之间、交易所之间和零售流的交换，因为几十年来，交易所和经纪人通过佣金和点差联盟欺骗消费者，这是受监管者鼓励的。为什么现在要信任他们呢？好像目前最重要的监管者巴尼·弗兰克在9个月后不会成为有效的克隆资本家，为其他目前的监管者大人树立一个榜样。他们的关键价值在于制造准入壁垒，因为没有一家大型机构会聘用一个能够降低消费者成本的人。当然，这一切都隐藏在一些关于预防欺诈、帮助维护交易所稳定、公平性和许多其他空话的借口之后。回想一下SEC在60年代和70年代所写的内容，知道他们是经纪公司和交易所的代言人，他们通过点差和佣金的勾结来偷窃投资者的钱财，这在一个竞争市场永远不会生存下去（感谢监管者！）。
