- en: Our friend Mike was a 25-year veteran of the Financial Service practice of a
    very large consulting firm. He was just informed that he was to be dismissed,
    on the basis of not making his (unrealistic) sales quota. The new management of
    the division and Mike did not agree on things, and the easy way to get rid of
    a person is to set him up for failure.

    services area. And, opportunity is also borne out of adversity.

    away, and was prepared.
