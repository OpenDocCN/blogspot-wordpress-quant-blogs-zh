- en: Quite a few commentators, including [Tim Knight](http://tradertim.blogspot.com/),
    have pointed out that the VIX has [reversed all of the post 2/27 spike](http://tradertim.blogspot.com/2007/03/give-past-slip.html).  While
    volatility measures are [subsiding much more rapidly than put to call ratios](http://www.market-harmonics.com/free-charts/sentiment/pcvi.htm),
    it is safe to say that some investors are thinking that the brief correction has
    passed and the bull market can now safely resume its course.  In short, some complacency
    is creeping back into the market, albeit slowly.

- en: The VIX Weekly Sentiment Indicator ([VWSI](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VWSI))
    reflects some of this complacency, as it has hugged the 0 mark the past few weeks,
    currently sitting at +1.

- en: While the VWSI generally seeks to predict VIX movements looking out only 1-2
    weeks, this is as good a time as any to remind the reader that longer term [seasonal
    cycles](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/seasonality) are at work as
    well.  You may never have heard, “Sell in March and go away,” but the March-June
    period marks the downside cycle of the mid-year “V” pattern in the VIX that I
    have [commented on earlier](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/01/month-by-month-look-at-vix.html).

    would expect that we will see a few more smaller ones in the coming weeks.  Better
    yet, be prepared to play a little [Whac-a-Mole](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whac-A-Mole)
    and fade these spikes as they occur.

    apply to the VIX, not to the broader markets, which are usually negatively correlated
    with the VIX.)

- en: 'Wine pairing: A while back, a reader had the temerity to suggest that I might
    want to consider offering a wine pairing with the VWSI. Why not? I''ve been neglecting
    my [wine blog](http://zinandpinot.blogspot.com/), so why not jump start the latent
    oenophile in all of us. For the current +1 reading, coming off of some violent
    volatility spikes and ushering in the new season, I am recommend a dry [gewurztraminer](http://www.epicurious.com/drinking/wine_dictionary/entry?id=6560).
    Gewurztraminer is a wine that can stand up to all seasons and all levels of volaltility.
    It has more personality than any other white wine, is found in more styles and...it''s
    not chardonnay. While the classic version comes from [Alsace](http://www.vinsalsace.com/en/),
    I am a big fan of several American versions of this wine: dry; off-dry; and the
    dessert variety. One winery that gets all three versions right is [Navarro](http://www.navarrowine.com/shop/productdetail.php?prodid=546).
    Last weekend, however, I found a stunning example of dry gewurz off the beaten
    track in the [Russian River Valley](http://www.rrvw.org/) at [Harvest Moon](http://www.harvestmoonwinery.com/our-wines.html).
    I hesitate to mention Harvest Moon because it is such a small winery, but the
    wines are so good that they deserve a wider audience. Enjoy!'
