    analysts, do not keep an accurate, testable track record, and so are deceitful,
    uncalibrated, and most importantly wrong. So it's fun to see his record bandied
    about in a misleading, tendentious way. Today's Wall Street Journal

- en: the Universa Fund he is affiliated with (but run by Mark Spitznagel), had "client
    portfolios [in 2009] down an average of about 4%, one person close to the matter
    said". "This year, Universa clients on average have lost about 2% of their notional
    account value", but in 2008 "extreme market losses helped many Universa clients
    profit more than 100%."

- en: There are a lot of qualifiers in those off-the-record statements. As implied
    vols went from 40 to 20 in 2009, I'd be surprised if his average client only lost
    4% that year. Further, as vols peaked around early November 2008 around 80, and
    then fell dramatically to 40 by December 31 2008, I'd be surprised if that 100%
    number is representative for 2008, because that was the number bandied about by
    the credulous press during the top tic in November when vols were 80\. Of course,
    without audited returns, who knows.

    man who makes a big deal out of the fact that financial professionals are miscalibrated
    and hide their track records. I know three people he threatened to sue for defamation;
    he's not forthright when it comes to his own record.

- en: were probably only 4% annualized (I don't have audited returns, so I'm going
    on hear say), and as it closed a year later, probably lower than that for its
    lifetime, pretty lame, but his 60% return in 2000 is all he needed for marketing.
    It's called the 'representativeness heuristic', a conspicuous focal point one
    then irrationally generalizes. Or it could be the 'anchoring heuristic', a number
    that once set, biases the final estimate towards this number. In any case, he's
    selling lottery tickets, an unfalsifiable strategy that generates really large
    returns in big crashes like 2008\. Great, but as volatility, especially at the
    tails, is priced if anything too high, I don't think this strategy has a positive
    expected value to anyone but the fund owners (and their advisers!).
