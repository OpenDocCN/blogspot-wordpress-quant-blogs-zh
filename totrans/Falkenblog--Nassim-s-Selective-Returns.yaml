    analysts, do not keep an accurate, testable track record, and so are deceitful,
    uncalibrated, and most importantly wrong. So it's fun to see his record bandied
    about in a misleading, tendentious way. Today's Wall Street Journal

    portfolios [in 2009] down an average of about 4%, one person close to the matter

    account value", but in 2008 "extreme market losses helped many Universa clients
    profit more than 100%."

    vols went from 40 to 20 in 2009, I'd be surprised if his average client only lost
    4% that year. Further, as vols peaked around early November 2008 around 80, and
    then fell dramatically to 40 by December 31 2008, I'd be surprised if that 100%
    number is representative for 2008, because that was the number bandied about by
    the credulous press during the top tic in November when vols were 80\. Of course,
    without audited returns, who knows.

- en: were probably only 4% annualized (I don't have audited returns, so I'm going
    on hear say), and as it closed a year later, probably lower than that for its
    lifetime, pretty lame, but his 60% return in 2000 is all he needed for marketing.
    It's called the 'representativeness heuristic', a conspicuous focal point one
    then irrationally generalizes. Or it could be the 'anchoring heuristic', a number
    that once set, biases the final estimate towards this number. In any case, he's
    selling lottery tickets, an unfalsifiable strategy that generates really large
    returns in big crashes like 2008\. Great, but as volatility, especially at the
    tails, is priced if anything too high, I don't think this strategy has a positive
    expected value to anyone but the fund owners (and their advisers!).

  zh: 可能只有4%年化收益率（没有经过审计的回报，所以我凭听说），随着一年后的结束，可能终身回报率低于这个数字，相当令人失望，但他2000年的60%回报对他的市场营销来说就足够了。这被称为“代表性启发式”，一个显眼的焦点使人不合理地一般化。或者它可能是“锚定启发式”，一旦设定的数字会使最终估计偏向于这个数字。无论哪种情况，他在卖彩票，一个不可驳回的策略，在2008年等大崩盘时产生了非常大的回报。不错，但是由于波动性，特别是在极端情况下，如果定价过高，我认为这种策略对任何人都没有正向预期价值，除了基金所有者（和他们的顾问！）。
