    has proposed a referendum early next year on the wildly unpopular rescue package.
    I wrote [here](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2011/10/framework-for-assessing-eurozone-rescue.html)
    that the success of the Grand Rescue Plan depends on the cooperation of the Greek
    Street and thought that they would acquiesce as long as no further austerity cuts
    were asked of them. Now that assumption seems to be unraveling.

    Analysis from [John Hussman](http://www.hussmanfunds.com/wmc/wmc111031.htm) indicates
    that the implied default probability from Portuguese bonds is somewhere between
    68% and almost 100% within two years.

    it had five Fridays, which meant that people getting paid every two weeks may
    have received three paychecks and that Five-Friday effect would have distorted

    but October 2011 only had four Fridays, which could lead to disappointment on

    If the Fed were to signal a more accommodative monetary policy based on further
