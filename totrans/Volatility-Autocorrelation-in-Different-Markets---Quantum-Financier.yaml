    in this post, I observed the autocorrelation of another moderator of daily follow-through;
    volatility. Intuitively, it makes sense for volatility to be highly autocorrelated.
    VIX spikes are a good example of it. Let’s look at how the autocorrelation of
    volatility behave during bull/bear markets as defined by the 200/50 days moving
    averages crossover.

    the 21 day rolling standard deviation of SPY returns, dividing them into percentiles
    (using the percent rank function with a 252 days lookback period) and looked at
    the average and the standard deviation of the percentiles.

    autocorrelated. However I thought that a bigger difference would exist between
    bull and bear markets. One thing to notice in the table below is that the autocorrelation
    is on average greater when the 50 day MA is greater than 200 day MA for all orders.
    The same observation holds true regarding the standard deviation.

    in numbers a well defined market mechanics. We know that volatility is easier
    to predict than returns, and the level of autocorrelation is greatly responsible
    for this fact. We also know that daily mean-reversion strategies perform better
    during high volatility regimes. Thus we can use the volatility autocorrelation
    as an indicator of the suitability of our strategy. For example, during a high
    volatility regime with high autocorrelation we can expect our strategy to perform
    well and vice-versa if we change the contingency. For a very interesting read
    about the predictability of volatility and its application to trading, I recommend
    this recent article winning the NAAIM 2010 Wagner award from Tony Cooper. [http://naaim.org/files/2010/1st_Place_Tony_Cooper_abstract.pdf](http://naaim.org/files/2010/1st_Place_Tony_Cooper_abstract.pdf)
