    is the table of [VIX spikes](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20spikes)
    of 30% or more that I update periodically in this space, along with the subsequent
    performance in the S&P 500 Index following these spikes.

- en: This time around I have elected to add an additional column that identifies
    the catalysts involved (necessarily a subjective process) in each instance. When
    thinking about these catalysts, it might be helpful to compare the nature of the
    threat and the size of the VIX spike to changes in volatility during various high-profile
    historical events, an analysis I captured in [Volatility During Crises](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2012/12/volatility-during-crises.html).
    Another useful exercise is to think about the fundamental factors influencing
    each VIX spike in the context of [A Conceptual Framework for Volatility Events](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/10/conceptual-framework-for-volatility.html),
    which I find particularly useful in helping to gauge just how large of a VIX spike
    a certain type of event might trigger.

    and technical. One interesting statistic I find worth highlighting is the relatively
    high frequency of large VIX spikes that have occurred during the past five years.
    VIX data goes back 26 years and yet more than half of the VIX spikes in this table
    data are from the past five years. I think it is no coincidence that the [VIX
    ETPs](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20ETN) (initially [VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX)
    and [VXZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXZ)) were launched in 2009
    and the inverse VIX ETPs ([XIV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XIV)
    and [ZIV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/ZIV)) and leveraged VIX
    ETPs (starting with [TVIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TVIX))
    were launched in the following year, when big VIX spikes suddenly became more
    common – much more so than during the [2008](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/2008)
    financial crisis, the dotcom crash, etc. For additional information on the subject
    of more VIX spikes in spite of a generally lower volatility environment, check
    out [2014 Had Third Highest Number of 20% VIX Spikes](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2015/01/2014-had-third-highest-number-of-20-vix.html).

    the SPX has a tendency to outperform its long-term average over the course of
    the 1, 3 and 5-day periods following the VIX spike. Also worth noting that that
    10 and 20 days following the VIX spike, the SPX has a tendency not only to underperform,
    but to decline. Further, while the huge decline following 9/29/08 VIX spike tends
    to dwarf the other data points, even when you remove the 9/29/08 VIX spike it
    turns out that the SPX still loses money in the 10 and 20-day period following
    a VIX spike. When the analysis is extended out 50 trading days, the SPX is back
    to being profitable, but performing below its long-term average. On the other
    hand, when the analysis includes 100 days following the VIX spike, the SPX is
    back to outperforming its long-term average.

    appears to generally be a tradable oversold condition in stocks that lasts approximately
    one week, followed by a period of another month or so in which the markets typically
    has difficulty coming to terms with the threat to stocks. This tendency makes
    today’s market action even more remarkable in that today was by far the worst
    performance of the SPX in a day following a 30% VIX spike.

    are usually in the rear view mirror and stocks are likely to have tacked on significant
    gains.

    of both short-term and longer-term [mean reversion](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/mean%20reversion),
    but calls into question the role of mean reversion in the 10-20 days following
    a VIX spike, where fundamental factors have a tendency to overwhelm a technically
    oversold condition in stocks.
