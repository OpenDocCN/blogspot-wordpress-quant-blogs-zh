- en: In the 'volatility innovation' story of risk, you are worried about not some
    market return proxy, but rather some volatility index. We all wish we had assets
    that appreciated when markets go crazy, like in 2001 or 2008, but we would have
    to pay a premium for that, which is why (supposedly) there's a market premium
    for it.

    more of a premium than buying volatility. There are large transaction costs to
    this direct strategy, especially historically, so it is not clear how economically
    meaningful this all is in terms of a realizable premium to selling volatility.

    Since 1995 the average has been 21.5, whereas realized vol was 20.3\. Thus, it

    sense, in that, you simply can't sell volatility as easily as buy, because of
    the capital requirements, so, return per underlying might look different, but
    on capital required via the market, not so different.

    flat (at best!) return to standard CAPM beta implies there must be some risk factor
    that offsets the negative correlation between volatility and the market. Whatever
    that could be makes absolutely no sense. That is, it probably had good returns
    in the October 1987, Sep 2001, and October 2008, yet still a positive average
    return. I'm open to suggestions, but this sounds the

    and more numerous, the theory becomes less clear. First, risk was the covariance
    with the stock market, but ever since then it has become more nuanced, and there's
    always a new proxy for the risk premium(s) that 'powerful new econometric techniques'
    are supposed to uncover.
