    market return proxy, but rather some volatility index. We all wish we had assets
    that appreciated when markets go crazy, like in 2001 or 2008, but we would have
    to pay a premium for that, which is why (supposedly) there's a market premium
    for it.

- en: If sensitivity to volatility innovations captures the risk premium, then the
    flat (at best!) return to standard CAPM beta implies there must be some risk factor
    that offsets the negative correlation between volatility and the market. Whatever
    that could be makes absolutely no sense. That is, it probably had good returns
    in the October 1987, Sep 2001, and October 2008, yet still a positive average
    return. I'm open to suggestions, but this sounds the

  zh: 如果对波动创新的敏感性捕获了风险溢价，那么标准CAPM beta的平（最好）回报意味着一定存在某种风险因素来抵消波动性和市场之间的负相关性。无论是什么，都毫无意义。也就是说，在1987年10月、2001年9月和2008年10月可能取得了不错的回报，但仍然是正平均收益。我愿意听取建议，但这听起来很莫名其妙。

    and more numerous, the theory becomes less clear. First, risk was the covariance
    with the stock market, but ever since then it has become more nuanced, and there's
    always a new proxy for the risk premium(s) that 'powerful new econometric techniques'
    are supposed to uncover.
