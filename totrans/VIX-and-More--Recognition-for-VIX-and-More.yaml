    is particularly heartening when that recognition comes from a respected peer in
    the field. For that reason, I was pleased to see that [Condor Options](http://www.condoroptions.com/)
    has included *VIX and More* in its list of the [Top Finance Blogs of 2008](http://www.condoroptions.com/index.php/trading-links/top-finance-blogs-of-2008/).

    believe I have yet featured the work of Ultimi Barbarorum on the blog. If so this
    omission is accidental, as Ultimi Barbarorum is a true thinking man’s blog in
    which the reader is treated to one side of the author’s ongoing dialogue with
    [Baruch Spinoza](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza/). What could be a
    better way to pay tribute to the closet philosopher in all of us?
