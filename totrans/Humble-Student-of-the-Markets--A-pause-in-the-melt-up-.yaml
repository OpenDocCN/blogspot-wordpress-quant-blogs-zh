    Kong may serve as a catalyst. In the wake of the passage of the Senate bill affirming
    support for the Hong Kong protesters, the bill will have to be reconciled with
    a similar House version, where it will arrive on President Trump`s desk for signature.
    China has already denounced the bill as unwarranted interference in its internal
    affairs. There is a chance that Trump will view it as leverage in the latest round
    of "Phase One" negotiations. No wonder the PredictIt odds of a Trump-Xi meeting,
    which is a proxy for a deal, is tanking.'
