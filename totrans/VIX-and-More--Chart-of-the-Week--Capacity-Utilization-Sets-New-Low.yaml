- en: I have been bullish since March 5^(th) ([SPX at 687; Intermediate Bottom Potential
    Is High](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/03/spx-at-687-intermediate-bottom.html)),
    but a number of factors have turned my bias back to the bearish side in the course
    of the past few days.

  zh: 我从3月5日以来一直持牛市态度([SPX在687点；中期底部潜力高](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/03/spx-at-687-intermediate-bottom.html)),但过去几天里，许多因素使我的偏见又转向了熊市。
- en: Apart from some technical indicators which suggest equities are overbought at
    present, there has been a recent wave of economic data, much of it swept under
    the rug, which suggests that bullish headlines may soon be on the wane. The news
    spans housing starts to foreclosures to credit card charge-offs to retail sales
    and industrial production. Frankly, none of it looks promising.

  zh: 除了某些技术指标暗示当前股市过热外，最近有一波经济数据，其中大部分被忽略了，这些数据暗示看涨的标题可能很快就会减少。新闻范围从房屋开工到抵押贷款违约，从信用卡违约到零售销售和工业生产。坦率地说，这一切看起来都不太乐观。
- en: Joined at the hip to the industrial production report is [capacity utilization](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/capacity%20utilization)
    data. Essentially, this statistic measures how much of the national production
    capacity is being used and how much is sitting idle.

  zh: 与工业生产报告紧密相关的是[产能利用率](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/capacity%20utilization)数据。本质上，这个统计数字衡量的是国家生产能力的多少正在被使用以及多少处于闲置状态。
- en: This week’s [chart of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week)
    looks at the full history of total capacity utilization in the United States,
    based on data available from the Federal Reserve. Total capacity utilization for
    March was just 69.3%. This is the lowest number in the history of this statistical
    series, which dates back to 1967\. While not shown in the graph below, manufacturing
    capacity utilization fell to 65.8%, which is the lowest number since records were
    first gathered in 1948.

  zh: 这周的[本周图表](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week)查看了美国联邦储备系统可获得数据的全貌，3月份的总产能利用率为69.3%。这是这项统计系列历史上最低的数字，该系列数据可以追溯到1967年。虽然下面的图表没有显示，3月份制造业产能利用率为65.8%，这是自1948年开始记录以来的最低数字。
- en: In terms of interpreting the capacity utilization data, it is probably best
    to think of the number as a broad measure of demand relative to existing infrastructure.
    Of course the current record low numbers reflect a historic weakness in demand.
    Capacity utilization is also a strong predictor of inflationary and deflationary
    pressures. With so much slack in the system, deflationary pressures are sure to
    increase as prices get slashed in order to offset the high fixed costs of so much
    idle productive capacity.

  zh: 在解释产能利用率数据时，最好将这个数字视为相对于现有基础设施的需求的一个广泛度量。当然，目前创纪录的低数字反映了需求的历史性疲软。产能利用率也是通货膨胀和通缩压力的强有力预测指标。系统中存在如此多的松弛，通缩压力肯定会随着为了抵消大量闲置生产能力的固定成本而削减价格而增加。
- en: In addition to the current bad news, there are some complicating factors which
    may make it difficult to reverse the recent trend. Looking ahead, a stronger dollar
    and weaker consumer does not bode well for future production data – and should
    raise new concerns about the possibility of deflation.

  zh: 除了当前的坏消息外，还有一些复杂的因素可能会使近期趋势难以扭转。展望未来，美元走强和消费者减弱对未来的生产数据并不利——应该引起对新通缩可能性的新的担忧。
