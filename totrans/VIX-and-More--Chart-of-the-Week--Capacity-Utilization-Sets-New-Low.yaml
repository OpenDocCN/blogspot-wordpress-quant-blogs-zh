    Is High](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/03/spx-at-687-intermediate-bottom.html)),
    but a number of factors have turned my bias back to the bearish side in the course
    of the past few days.

    present, there has been a recent wave of economic data, much of it swept under
    the rug, which suggests that bullish headlines may soon be on the wane. The news
    spans housing starts to foreclosures to credit card charge-offs to retail sales
    and industrial production. Frankly, none of it looks promising.

    data. Essentially, this statistic measures how much of the national production
    capacity is being used and how much is sitting idle.

    looks at the full history of total capacity utilization in the United States,
    based on data available from the Federal Reserve. Total capacity utilization for
    March was just 69.3%. This is the lowest number in the history of this statistical
    series, which dates back to 1967\. While not shown in the graph below, manufacturing
    capacity utilization fell to 65.8%, which is the lowest number since records were
    first gathered in 1948.

- en: In terms of interpreting the capacity utilization data, it is probably best
    to think of the number as a broad measure of demand relative to existing infrastructure.
    Of course the current record low numbers reflect a historic weakness in demand.
    Capacity utilization is also a strong predictor of inflationary and deflationary
    pressures. With so much slack in the system, deflationary pressures are sure to
    increase as prices get slashed in order to offset the high fixed costs of so much
    idle productive capacity.

    may make it difficult to reverse the recent trend. Looking ahead, a stronger dollar
    and weaker consumer does not bode well for future production data – and should
    raise new concerns about the possibility of deflation.

    is an often overlooked important piece of the economic puzzle.
