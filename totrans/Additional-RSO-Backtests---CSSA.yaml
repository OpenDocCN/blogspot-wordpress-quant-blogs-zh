     Michael writes frequently about different methods for asset allocation. Some
    of his posts for example on Principal Components Analysis (PCA) are very comprehensive
    and well worth reading. Recently he wrote a [post](http://systematicedge.wordpress.com/2013/10/14/random-subspace-optimization-max-sharpe/) showing
    some additional tests using the [Random Subspace Optimization](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2013/10/06/random-subspace-optimization-rso/
    "Random Subspace Optimization (RSO)") (RSO) with maximum sharpe optimization (long
    only) on various universes with a step parameter test for “k.” The results are
    interesting and support the following conclusions: 1) RSO is a promising method
    to increase return and reduce risk 2) the choice of “k” is important to get the
    best results.  I will present a few more ideas on extending RSO to follow.'
