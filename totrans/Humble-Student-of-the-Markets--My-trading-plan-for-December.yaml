    (middle panel), as well as the Bear-Bull flow ratio (bottom panel). Both ratios
    are important indicators of investor sentiment. The asset ratio is a barometer
    of how much bullish and bearish investors have committed to their directional
    bets, but it could be misleading if viewed in isolation. Imagine that investors
    committed $X to the bull side and $Y to the bear side; there were no cash flows
    and the stock market went up by 10% during this period. The bear-bull asset ratio
    would fall to reflect the increase in stock prices but an observer might see misinterpret
    this as contrarian bearish because it had fallen 20% (+10% for bulls and -10%
    for bears). That`s why it`s important to view this in the context of the bear-bull
    cash flow ratio as well.

    on two factors—how the economy evolves, and how financial market conditions respond
    to movements in the federal funds rate target. ***Financial market conditions
    mainly include, but are not necessarily limited to, the level of short- and long-term
    interest rates, credit spreads and availability, equity prices and the foreign
    exchange value of the dollar.*** When the FOMC adjusts its short-term federal
    funds rate target, this does not directly influence the economy since little economic
    activity is linked to the federal funds rate. Instead, monetary policy affects
    the economy as the current change in short-term interest rates and expectations
    about future monetary policy changes influence financial market conditions more
    broadly.

    and summer of 2013—then this would likely prompt a slower and more cautious approach.
    In contrast, if the reaction were relatively small or even in the wrong direction,
    with financial market conditions easing—think of the response of long-term bond
    yields and the equity market as the asset purchase program was gradually phased
    out over the past year—then this would imply a more aggressive approach**.** The
    key point is this: ***We will pursue the monetary policy stance that best generates
    the set of financial market conditions most consistent with achievement of the

    economic conditions may warrant a tightening of financial market conditions. If
    this happens mainly via the channel of equity price weakness—that is not a problem,
    as it does not conflict with our objectives. In contrast, when we want financial
    market conditions to be extremely accommodative—as has been the case in recent
    years when we have been far away from our employment and inflation objectives—then
