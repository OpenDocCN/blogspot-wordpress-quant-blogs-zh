    through shiny](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2012/12/d3-and-r-interacting-through-shiny.html)
    was so weak, I thought it would be interesting to combine the much more compelling
    [Showreel Example](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/tree/master/examples/showreel)
    with the same stock data.  However, this time the data will come from R getSymbols. 
    Also, most of the plots would be better using cumulative return data, so we will
    use R to convert the price data into a cumulative return series.

    and although much of the code is now gone, the structure and idea belong to [Trestle
