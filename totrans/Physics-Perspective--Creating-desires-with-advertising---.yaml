    people more or less drunk. An automobile can take one reliably to a destination
    and back...  There being so little to be said, much must be invented. Social distinction
    must be associated with a house... sexual fulfillment with a particular... automobile,
    social acceptance with... a mouthwash, etc. We live surrounded by a systematic
    appeal to a dream world which all mature, scientific reality would reject. We,
    quite literally, advertise our commitment to immaturity, mendacity and profound
    gullibility. It is the hallmark of our culture.
