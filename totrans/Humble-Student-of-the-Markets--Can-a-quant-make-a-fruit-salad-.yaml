    work one way, or all neuroscientists work another way. But it’s true that with
    neuroscience, it’s going to require decades or even hundreds of years to understand
    the deep principles. There is progress at the very lowest levels of neuroscience.
    But for issues of higher cognition—how we perceive, how we remember, how we act—we
    have no idea how neurons are storing information, how they are computing, what
    the rules are, what the algorithms are, what the representations are, and the
    like. So we are not yet in an era in which we can be using an understanding of
    the brain to guide us in the construction of intelligent systems.

    getting a license from the Tsar for a certain activity, such as fishing for herring
    in the Baltic. The license could be taken away at any time at the Tsar's pleasure.
    Such a framework for doing business creates certain incentives and disincentives.
    First of all, you have no property rights. Since the license could be taken away
    at any time, you behaved in a highly political manner, and you have no incentive
    to undertake capital investments. The correct approach under such circumstances
    would be to engage in a harvesting strategy - to take as much as you could and
    suck the resource dry. That's the sort of Russia that Putin seems to be encouraging.
