- en: The drip-drip-drip of these glitches culminated in a massive stock market wipeout
    as over US$6 trillion has been wiped from the combined capitalization of the Chinese
    and Hong Kong markets since the 2021 market peak. As an illustration of the depth
    of the carnage, the Hang Seng Index fell to test levels seen at the 1997 handover
    to China. Beijing responded with a plan to order State Owned Enterprises to use
    its offshore currency reserves, which is estimated to be 2-trillion yuan, or US$278
    billion, to buy Chinese stocks to prop up the market. In addition, the PBoC announced
    a half-point cut to the required reserve ratio on February 5 to provide greater
    liquidity to the financial system.
