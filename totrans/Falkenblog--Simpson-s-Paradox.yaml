    due to the collective bargaining rights of Wisconsin educators (Texas does not
    have those).

    outperforms Wisconsin. As ethnic performance varies predictably across all states,
    ignoring the ethnic composition of states is really misleading, and is why my
    state, Minnesota, appears to do so well on these simple measures.

- en: It's a really fun issue that pops up often, and good to be aware of because
    it's one of those cases where an omitted variables bias is at work. That is, the
    effect of x on y shows a significant coefficient, but when you include another
    variable, the coefficient on x goes to zero or even changes sign. This usually
    shows up in a simple cross-tabulation, and it's good practice to always be looking
    for other variables that could affect your findings, because if you are trying
    to make money like I am, it's good to know the truth (if your a partisan shill
    it's a minor annoyance).

    relation between beta and average returns. Much of the apparent relation between
    price or size and returns, meanwhile, is the result of measurement errors such
    as the delisting bias and the problems of geometric averaging (I know CRSP

    in their data, and that's obviously not obtainable, as evidenced by the failure
    of low-priced funds that were popular in the late 80's--now gone).
