- en: For the 2nd day in a row the S&P 500 saw a sizable move in the last 10 minutes
    of the day. This time, though it was to the upside as the index gained nearly
    1% from 3:50 to 4pm. We saw yesterday an example of how overly strong reactions
    are many times overreactions. Tonight I looked at the sharp upside reaction as
    opposed to last night’s downside reaction.

    intraday bars lately. To add to that, I would say almost every move the market
    has made in this highly charged environment has been an overreaction. It has in
    fact created vicious whipsaws in both directions for intraday and swing style
    traders.
