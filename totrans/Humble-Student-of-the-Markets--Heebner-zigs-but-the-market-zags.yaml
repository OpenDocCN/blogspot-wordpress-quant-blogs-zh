    The fund is -13.7% to April 6 YTD, which is 6.9% behind the S&P 500.

- en: When I reverse engineer Heebner’s macro exposures, it seems that he got bullish
    too early and is now in the process of reversing course. As an example, the chart
    below shows his beta exposure to the S&P 500\. He raised his market exposure early
    and as the market tanked he pulled back, just in time for the bear market rally.

- en: Ken Heebner has a bottom-up driven investment process but takes big macro bets
    as a result of his bottom-up analysis. This style can work well when the economy
    is showing a trend, but I believe that Heebner tried to call the turning point
    a little early and got hurt.

- en: that trend following CTAs are also struggling as the macro backdrop is trying
    to find its footing as the economy stabilizes. However, stabilization is not equal
    an upturn and a bull market revival is not yet in sight. In a nutshell, that may
    be Heebner’s problem.
