    rates and profit potential of playing breakout of them.

    and what a break (like we saw yesterday) might mean.

- en: For coding purposes I simply defined a triangle as a pattern where the most
    recent swing high was lower than the previous swing high, and the most recent
    swing low was higher than the previous swing low, and the market was currently
    between those two points. This admittedly isn't the most sophisticated description,
    and some market technicians might suggest additional nuances should be included.
    Still, it seemed to be enough to identify the basic pattern of a tightening range.

    below the most recent swing low. Here it could certainly be argued that a trend
    line break might be more effective. I personally don't believe it would make a
    whole lot of difference.

- en: Once entered the strategy was designed to exit when price either reached its
    target or its stop area. To calculate the target price I simply took the height
    of the triangle and extended that past the entry point. The stop was set at the
    opposing swing high or swing low that would have triggered an entry in the opposite
    direction had the triangle broken the other way. No trailing stops or other trade
    management techniques were incorporated.

- en: Results in general were much like those results I discussed 3 years ago. I did
    break it down a number of different ways, though. One interesting set of results
    came from looking at triangle breakdowns in the SPX when it was in a long-term
    uptrend. Those results can be seen below.

- en: Entries and exits are as I described above. So in this case the results show
    the performance of shorting a breakdown. As you can see there has been an strong
    tendency for this trade to reverse back up and be stopped out before reaching
    its downside target.
