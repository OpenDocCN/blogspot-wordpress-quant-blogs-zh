    be coined “HFT in my backyard | S02E01”, or “S22E45”, or in more simple terms
    “Going to the Signal to get signals faster”. This blog has been silent for a while
    as I really didn’t have the time to write here, but that doesn’t mean there is
    nothing to say (in fact, there is a lot to write about but as I’ll explain later,
    I decided to withdraw the season 2 of “HFT in my backyard” as I’ll write a whole
    book about all my investigation on the wireless networks the HFTs love). But I
    couldn’t resist to add this new episode of “HFT in the Banana land”, even if it’s
    not about the banana – but a consequence of what happened in Richborough where
    the two giant masts Vigilant and New Line Networks wanted to erect there were
    harshly refused by the Dover District Council (read the previous [episode](https://sniperinmahwah.wordpress.com/2017/01/30/hft-in-the-banana-land-part-6/)).

    point of the country: 694 meters above the sea level. Secondly, it’s one of the
    few ski resorts of Belgium. Thirdly (in my opinion), this is one of the most beautiful places
    of Belgium. I went there a couple of times to explore the “[High Fens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Fens)”,
    or “Hautes Fagnes” in French, a very nice nature reserve.

    in the highest point of Belgium (actually it’s the highest point of both Belgium,

    to erect a 6 meter stairs :“*[Apparently](http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/signal-de-botrange),
    clocking the country’s highest point in at just shy of 700 meters was simply too
    tantalizing, and so in 1923, a 6-meter (18-foot) stone staircase was constructed
    atop the peak. From its height, on the top step of the seemingly nonsensical staircase,
    visitors can survey the land from exactly 700 meters above sea level*.” The ridiculous

    is “A new 50-meter tower to suport financial operations between London and Frankfurt”,
    and I think this is the very first press coverage in Belgium on the microwave networks
    (too bad I missed it before). In short the mayor says that the local community
    have been contacted by a Canadian firm (that smells Vigilant), by an American
    firm (that smells Jump, now New Line Networks), by a consortium including French,
    Dutch and German firms (the French one should be McKay Brothers, the Dutch firm
    is strange – that could be Optiver or Flow Traders, but both the Dutch firms don’t
    work with McKay…). The mayor explains the different competitors wanted to erect
    a towers in Botrange because the fibre is too slow, so HFTs use microwave, etc.
    At least the local people know exactly why some firms need new towers… The mayor
    also says that a request for proposals would be made as the total budget is €M2-3\.
    It’s not clear if the mayor states that all this money would be distributed to
    the local community, but he seems to be very happy with the project as the new
    50-meter tower would be higher than anything in Botrange. A new record!

    the Collège communal (the municipal college) started to open the enveloppes. I
    called the local office to know more about what’s going with the offers, but the
    clerk told me that they can’t communicate now as the Conseil communal (an other
    administrative college) will have to discuss the offers too, etc. I was not even
    able to know how many offers were sent to Botrange. But the local authorities
    should decide soon about the next dead-lines. Who will be the winner? One can
    assume the Canadian firm, the American firm and the French firm submitted offers
    but perhaps there are other HFT lurking around Botrange too… We will see. Anyway,
    that’s amazing the HFTs want to be on the Signal to get signals faster. Thanks
