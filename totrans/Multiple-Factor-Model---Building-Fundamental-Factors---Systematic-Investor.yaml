- en: This is the second post in the series about Multiple Factor Models. I will build
    on the code presented in the prior post, [Multiple Factor Model – Fundamental
    Data](https://systematicinvestor.wordpress.com/2012/01/29/multiple-factor-model-fundamental-data/),
    and I will show how to build Fundamental factors described in the CSFB Alpha Factor
    Framework. For details of the CSFB Alpha Factor Framework please read [CSFB Quantitative
    Research, Alpha Factor Framework on page 11, page 49 by P. N. Patel, S. Yao, R.
    Carlson, A. Banerji, J. Handelman](http://www.scribd.com/mobile/documents/62210581/download?commit=Download+Now&secret_password=).

- en: The CSFB Alpha Factor Framework has both traditional Fundamental factors and
    industry relative Fundamental factors. Let’s start by getting Fundamental data
    that we will need to create Price/Earnings, Price/Sales, Price/Cash Flow, Dividend
    Yield, Price/Book factors. In the prior post, I mentioned that it takes a while
    to download historical fundamental data for all companies in the Dow Jones index,
    and I recommend saving fundamental data with save(data.fund, file=’data.fund.Rdata’)
    command. In the following code I will just load historical fundamental data with
    load(file=’data.fund.Rdata’) command instead of downloading all data again.

    Sales and Cash Flow are not really measurable for financial firms. Please read
    [Valuing Financial Service Firms by A. Damodaran](www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/papers/finfirm09.pdf)
    for detailed explanation why Sales and Cash Flow are not really measurable for
    financial firms.

    to z scores) all Traditional Value factors by subtracting capitalization weighted
    average and dividing by standard deviation. The overall Traditional Value factor
    is an average of all normalized Traditional Value factors.

- en: I created a [compute.quantiles() function in factor.model.r at github](https://github.com/systematicinvestor/SIT/blob/master/R/factor.model.r)
    to compute and plot quantiles. For example, the quantiles chart for EP factor
    shows the average next month performance of stocks in each quantiles. The quantiles
    are created each month by ranking stocks by EP factor and grouping them into 5
    quantiles. There is tendency of quantile 5 (Q5) to outperform quantile 1 (Q1)
    in most cases. The relationship between quantiles is not perfect, but the spread
    between Q5-Q1 is positive.

    but is inverted from 1995 to 2000\. This is a bit strange and calls for more investigation.
