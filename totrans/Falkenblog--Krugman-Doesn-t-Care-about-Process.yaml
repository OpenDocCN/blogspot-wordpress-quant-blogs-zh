    a narcissistic profession his narcissism stands out, but I guess to run for President
    on his resume that's a given. Obama also talked about paying more attention to
    process, Jon Stewart's main complaint when

    about earmarks; they’re just code for spending less (less on somebody else, of
    course, not me). Nobody cares about civility and bipartisanship, which in practice
    are code for Democrats giving in to Republican demands.

    "Who—whom?" No verb was necessary. It meant ''who prevails over whom?'' Everything
    is always about power, in the past and in the future. Krugman dismisses the ''how''--institutions,
    incentives, and all other means to an end and focuses on what--for him, matters:
    who gets what, and who pays what. Krugman''s dismissal of means over ends explains
    why he''s unconcerned about deficits and taxes because those are means to his
    end, which is egalitarian redistribution managed by an all-powerful (but smart
    and good) state.'

    Countless times in the past people have expropriated the rich to spread power
    to the more numerous poor (Russians and Kulaks, Turkey and Armenians, Jewish expropriations
    throughout history). This has not been a productive strategy because prosperity
    and liberty comes from having strong property rights, which includes letting people
    keep their income and property. You can't get the end 'prosperity and liberty'
    directly, you merely can merely create conditions where this is maximized.

    suggesting one ignore indirect effects. It's what differentiates an economist,
    even a liberal economist, from a radical adolescent muckraker. I guess this highlights
    Lord Acton's dictum that power corrupts, and so like Smeagol to Gollum, his popularity
    and power have turned him from a thoughtful person to a dogmatic liberal shill
    for more government.
