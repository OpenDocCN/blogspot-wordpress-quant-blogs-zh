, a book I'm afraid to say is still on my to-read list, was interviewed at

. Great read. I feel like I just read an interview of Howard Roark.

. A few interesting quotes:

 > N.N.T.: ...I have a sense of security, and it produces income, but it's uncompromising. It so happens that being uncompromising has worked for me so far—more than worked.
> 
> The point is, I don't give a flying damn about the public eye. I care about ideas, all right? So I cannot be divorced from my ideas.

> ****N.N.T.:** Maybe, but I'm not playing a role. If someone asked me for an op-ed, I wouldn't write it. *Harper's* asked me for an op-ed, "Can We Save Capitalism?" you know, and I told them, "Listen, no editing, these are my rules, this is the style."** 
> 
>  ****L.G.:** Did they do it?
> 
> **N.N.T.:** No, they stopped talking to me. But at this point, my books are read by more people than any journal.**

**-----**

> ******L.G.:** I'm just curious, how much in lecture fees have you turned down?**** 
> 
>  ******N.N.T.:** I turn down things all the time. I've definitely turned down $60,000 for something.
> 
> **L.G.:** Because they wanted you to talk on a topic that didn't interest you?
> 
> **N.N.T.:** No, because the crowd didn't interest me, I'd rather stay home and work in my library.****
