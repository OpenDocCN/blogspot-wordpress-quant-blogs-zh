- en: The [VIX:VXV ratio](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%3AVXV),
    which has been decidedly neutral for more than two months, is up over 1.08 (was
    at 1.10 earlier), signaling a buy.

- en: Officially, this ratio does not generate a buy or sell signal until the end
    of the day, but on days like today, it is always nice to get an early warning
    signal.

    the close and update the signal, if any.
