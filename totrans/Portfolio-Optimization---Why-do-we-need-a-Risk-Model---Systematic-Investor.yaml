    how to build a multiple factor risk model. In this post I want to explain why
    do we need a risk model and how it is used during portfolio construction process.

- en: 'The covariance matrix is used during the [mean-variance portfolio optimization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory)
    to estimate portfolio risk. The sample covariance matrix can estimated using historical
    asset’s returns, but the use of the sample covariance matrix becomes problematic
    when the number of assets (N) is of the same order of magnitude or larger than
    the number of observations (T). In typical applications, there can be over a thousand
    stocks to choose from, but rarely more than ten years of monthly data (i.e. N
    = 1,000 and T = 120). I recommend following references for a detailed discussion:'

- en: 'One possible solution to estimating a covariance matrix is to model risk by
    a low-dimensional multiple factor model. Another advantage of using a multiple
    factor model to describe covariances between assets is that portfolio optimization
    algorithm works faster because the covariance matrix is quite sparse and well
    structured. For a detailed discussion please read: [Portfolio Optimization with
    Factors, Scenarios, and Realistic Short Positions by B. Jacobs, K. Levy, and H.
    Markowitz (2005)](http://www.jlem.com/articles/jlem/portfolioOptimization.pdf)
    [In problems with a large number of securities, computation time may differ by
    orders of magnitude between using a dense covariance matrix(sample covariance
    matrix) and using the diagonal or nearly diagonal covariance matrices permitted
    by a multiple factor model of covariance.]'

    function first to create and save multiple factor risk model.] Next, I will construct
    minimum variance portfolio using the historical covariance matrix.

- en: The minimum variance portfolio computed under the risk model is more diversified.
    Also for a larger stock universe (i.e. 1000-2000 stocks) solving quadratic problem
    will take less time using a factor risk model that results in a sparse covariance
    matrix.
