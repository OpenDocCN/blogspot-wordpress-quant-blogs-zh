    bust. Property investment has grown to account for about 13 per cent of gross
    domestic product, roughly double the US share at the height of the bubble in 2007\.
    Add related sectors, such as steel, cement and other construction materials, and
    the figure is closer to 16 per cent. The broadly defined property sector accounts
    for about a third of fixed-asset investment, which Beijing is supposed to be subordinating
    to the target of economic rebalancing in favour of household consumption. It accounts
    for about a fifth of commercial bank loans but is used as collateral in at least
    two-fifths of total lending. The booming property market, moreover, has produced
    bounteous revenues from land sales, which fuel much local and provincial government
    infrastructure spending.

    As the property slowdown has kicked in, housing starts, completions and sales
    have turned markedly lower, especially outside the principal cities. Inventories
    of unsold homes in Beijing are reported to have risen from seven to 12 months’
    supply in the year to April. But when it comes to homes under construction and
    total sales, the bulk is in “tier two” cities, where the overhang of unsold homes
    has risen to about 15 months; and in tier three and four cities, where it is about
    24 months.

    to financial failures and knock-ons everywhere else — downstream industries, local
    government revenues, collateral for bank lending and via wealth effects on consumption
    to name a few specifics.*** As UBS note, given that property investment accounts
    for almost a quarter of fixed investment, construction value-added is 13 per cent
    of GDP, and there are extensive linkages between property and industrial sectors
    including steel, cement and construction machinery, the impact on the economy
    from a drop in construction volume is bigger than that from a worsening household

    system as depositors can obtain higher returns than that available from banks.
    But this increases risk. The shadow banking system has led to systemic issues,
    such as a rapid increase in debt levels and complex links with the banking system.
    Limited regulation has led to poor governance and risk disclosure. It has increased
