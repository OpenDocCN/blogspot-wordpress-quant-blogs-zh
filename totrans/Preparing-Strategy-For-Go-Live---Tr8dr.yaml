- en: I’ve been too busy to post for the last few weeks because am trying to get things
    together to launch the first strategy for trading (as part of my trading startup).
       Have 4 strategies right now but decided to start with the simplest of the lot.
      It operates on a basket of equities at medium/low frequency and has excellent
    returns and drawdown profile.

      Will post some results after it has a trading track record.   Right now have
    just done the backtesting and some trial trading (affected manually).

    Details at this point, but will take time.
