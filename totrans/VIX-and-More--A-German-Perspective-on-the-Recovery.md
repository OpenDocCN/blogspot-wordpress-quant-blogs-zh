# VIX and More: A German Perspective on the Recovery

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/06/german-perspective-on-recovery.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/06/german-perspective-on-recovery.html#0001-01-01)

Yesterday, in [Fundamentals and the Recovery](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/06/fundamentals-and-recovery.html), I offered up a snapshot of the recovery in the United States in terms of [industrial production](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/industrial%20production), income, employment, and [retail sales](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/retail%20sales).

Today, I thought I’d at least temporarily jettison my overly Americentric view of the investment universe and look at the recovery in the same areas through the eyes of [Germany](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Germany). As the graphic below shows, relative to past periods of economic recovery, the current recovery looks more typical than atypical. With a continued weak [euro](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/euro), I would not at all be surprised to see the performance of the German economy to begin to accelerate to the upside, which would bode well for the Germany ETF, [EWG](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EWG).

Of course, the bigger issue may turn out to be the exposure of German banks to Greece and some of the other troubled euro zone economies, per a recent Wall Street Journal, [Data Show Big Exposure for Banks in Euro Zone](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703389004575304661402558720.html).
