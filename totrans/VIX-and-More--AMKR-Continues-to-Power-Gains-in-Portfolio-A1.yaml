- en: With [another week](http://stockcharts.com/charts/gallery.html?amkr) of strong
    gains, [Amkor (AMKR)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=amkr&hl=en) now has
    logged a cumulative gain of 33% since Portfolio A1 began 4 ½ months ago.

- en: Weakness across the balance of the portfolio – with the notable exception of
    [Terex (TEX)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=tex&hl=en) – has resulted in
    the portfolio underperforming the S&P 500 benchmark over the course of the past
    two months.  For the full life of the portfolio, the gains of 4.8% continue to
    better the S&P 500, but by a margin that has slipped to 1.5%.

- en: I should note that with the fractional losses of the two holdings added last
    week, Portfolio A1 now has had a total of four winning trades and eight losing
    trades to date.  This is important because the intent of this portfolio is not
    to aim for a high percentage of winners by hitting a lot of singles, but to seek
    out doubles, triples and home runs, with the expectation that there will be many
    instances in which the portfolio is stopped out of losing trades.  Based on past
    performance of similar portfolios, my guess is that it will probably take a year
    or two before this approach is evident from the portfolio statistics.
