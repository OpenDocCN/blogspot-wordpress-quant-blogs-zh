    Even as the S&P 500 rallied to all-time highs, the NYSE Advance-Decline Line did
    not confirm the fresh high. The relative performance of high beta to low volatility
    stocks, which is an indicator of equity risk appetite, is barely testing its overhead
    resistance. In the meantime, the 10-year Treasury yield (inverted scale) has been
    climbing and higher yields offer an increasingly more attractive alternative for
    investors. And the USD, which is historically inversely correlated to the S&P
    500, has been rallying and creating headwinds for stock prices.
