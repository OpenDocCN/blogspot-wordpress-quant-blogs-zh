    people to a new site that looks promising - ETF Prophet.

- en: It is the work of a few bloggers who I've admired for some time including Jeff
    Pietsch of Market Rewind and Bob Barnes of BZBTrader. In all they have a total
    of 7 contributors, some experienced and some new to writing. I'm familiar with
    5 of the 7 contributors and suspect ETFProphet will fast become a place where
    readers can find some thought provoking original thinking. I'm looking forward
    to following them.
