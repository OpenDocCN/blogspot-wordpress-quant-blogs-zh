    continues. A [story](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/25/business/economy/25gret.html)
    in the New York Times reports that the courts are taking a dim view of lenders
    who try to foreclose without proper documentation. If this trend continues, chaos
    will ensue.

    the vice-chairman at Goldman Sachs stated that the public must "tolerate the inequality
    as a way to achieve greater prosperity for all" - an unfortunate remark picked
    up by [The Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2009/oct/21/executive-pay-bonuses-goldmansachs).
    Meanwhile, a headline in the alternative press reads [After the Billionaires Plundered
    Alabama Town, Troops Were Called in ... Illegally](http://www.alternet.org/workplace/143485/nightmare_in_america%253A_after_the_billionaires_plundered_alabama_town%252C_troops_were_called_in?page=1).

    proving to be prescient. These stories sound like the sorts of things that might
    happen in an emerging market country in financial trouble. Is there any wonder
    why there is downward pressure on the US Dollar?'
