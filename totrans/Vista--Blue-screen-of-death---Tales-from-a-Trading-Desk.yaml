    portable occurred without a hitch ‚Äì no surprise given that the hardware is less
    than 3mths old. My Dell desktop was a different kettle of fish. Essentially I
    had the same driver issues as I‚Äôd experience with RC1 and [RC2](https://mdavey.wordpress.com/2006/05/27/vista-build-5384-office-beta-2/).
    The root of the problem was that my desktop has a nice 512Mb [ATI](http://ati.amd.com/)
    Radeon X1600 PRO, however when installing Windows Vista RTM the drivers for this
    card that Microsoft kindly include are version 7.14 dated 21/8/2006, whereas the
    drivers on ATI‚Äôs site are [8.31](http://www.atitech.ca/support/drivers/vista32/common-vista32.html)
    dated 2/11/2006\. The 7.12 driver appear to cause the Vista install to hang on
    the driver being loaded; this promptly caused a blue screen of death. This then
    snowballed into the next problem; the blue screen on appears for about 1-2 seconds
    before the PC reboots attempting to continue with the installation. The only words
    I managed to read during this time period was ‚Äúdriver in infinite loop‚Äù or similar,
    which isn‚Äôt exactly very helpful. I eventually got Vista installed, but only by
    following these steps:'

    old drivers supplied by Microsoft ‚Äì there doesn‚Äôt appear to be a simple way to
    cancel this install, so if you reboot after this, then Vista will blue screen
    again, and you will have to go into Safe Mode and remove the graphics cards

    to solve is that the Dell originally came with a CNET ethernet card, which as
    expected doesn‚Äôt have Vista drivers üò¶ Luckily [Dabs](http://www.dabs.com) sells
    D-Link DFE-530TX cards for under ¬£10 ‚Äì drivers for this network card already appear
    to be available within Vista.
