- en: Microfinancing is a growing trend among investors, as it offers low-risk money
    opportunities and a way to bring social change to poverty-stricken communities.
    "Low-risk" doesn't equal "no risk," of course, so many potential microlenders
    are keen to learn the ins and outs of credit risk management in this arena. After
    all, most microborrowers have poor credit or no credit at all. A villager who
    needs $200 for starting a third-world chicken farm isn't going to fare well in
    that department, as you can imagine.

  zh: 小额信贷是投资者日益增长的趋势，因为它提供了低风险的资金机会，以及将社会变革带到贫困社区的方式。"低风险"并不等于"无风险"，当然，所以许多潜在的小额贷款人都渴望学习这个领域的信用风险管理的方方面面。毕竟，大多数微型借款人都有不良信用或没有信用。一个需要200美元来启动第三世界养鸡场的村民在这个部门的表现可能不会太好，正如你可以想象的那样。
- en: The good news is, even in the event of a loan delinquency, you won't be losing
    a substantial amount of money. Most microloans range from a few hundred to a few
    thousand dollars. Any losses are unfortunate, though, so you will want to manage
    your microlending risks and keep loan delinquencies to a minimum.

  zh: 好消息是，即使在贷款违约的情况下，你也不会损失大量的钱。大多数小额贷款从几百美元到几千美元不等。任何损失都是不幸的，所以你需要管理你的小额贷款风险，并将贷款违约降到最低。

  zh: 以下是作为小额信贷员管理风险的五个步骤：
- en: Research Your Borrower – If you're lending through a site, such as [Prosper](http://www.prosper.com/),
    then you will have access to your borrower's profile and credit reports. However,
    don’t be afraid to ask more questions if you have any doubts about this person's
    ability to repay the loan. If you are lending the money through other channels,
    definitely start with the credit reports and interview the borrower.

  zh: 研究你的借款人：如果你通过像[Prosper](http://www.prosper.com/)这样的网站借款，那么你将能够访问到借款人的资料和信用报告。然而，如果你对此人的偿还能力有任何疑问，不要害怕提出更多的问题。如果你通过其他渠道放贷，一定要从信用报告开始，并面试借款人。
- en: Lend With a Group – Though this won't make your borrower any more likely to
    repay a loan, lending with a group will help to spread out the cost and share
    responsibility. In other words, you will be risking less money and will have other
    people with the same interests to consult with.

  zh: 团体借款：虽然这并不会使借款人更有可能偿还贷款，但团体借款可以帮助分摊成本并共享责任。换句话说，你将承担较少的资金风险，并且有相同兴趣的其他人可以与你咨询。
- en: Use Analytical Tools – Third-party applications can help you determine what
    is working best with your microlending. Both seasoned microlenders and newcomers
    are highly encouraged to use such tools. Microfinance sites that come with excellent
    built-in tools include [Trickle Up](http://www.trickleup.org/), [Opportunity International](http://www.opportunity.org/)
    and [Heifer International](http://www.heifer.org/).

  zh: 使用分析工具：第三方应用程序可以帮助您确定您的小额贷款业务中哪方面做得最好。无论是经验丰富的小额贷款人还是新手，都强烈建议使用此类工具。带有优秀内置工具的小额金融网站包括[Trickle
    Up](http://www.trickleup.org/)，[Opportunity International](http://www.opportunity.org/)和[Heifer
    International](http://www.heifer.org/)。
- en: Provide Incentives – Consider an incentive program for those who pay on time.
    A small, inexpensive gift will be very appreciated by those living in third-world
    countries. Lenders have used food, such as rice or corn meal, as a bonus.

  zh: 提供激励措施：考虑为那些按时还款的人设立一个激励计划。对于生活在第三世界国家的人来说，一个小礼物，比如一些食物，比如大米或玉米粉，将会非常受欢迎。放贷人已经用食物作为奖金。
- en: Be Proactive in Collecting – This doesn't mean you should harass your borrowers.
    However, you should research your delinquent accounts as soon as payments are
    late, rather than letting them go into default. There could be a simple breakdown
    in communication or an emergency on the borrower's end.
  id: totrans-18
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 积极收款 - 这并不意味着你应该骚扰你的借款人。然而，一旦付款逾期，你应该尽快调查你的逾期账户，而不是让他们进入违约状态。可能存在简单的沟通 breakdown
    或者借款人方面的紧急情况。
- en: One of the biggest draws of microfinancing is the relatively low risk involved.
    However, that doesn't mean that you will have a 100% success rate. The best way
    to get your feet wet is to start with a small loan. Something as low as $100 will
    let you learn the process and allow you to become more comfortable with the system.
    Microfinancing isn't for everyone, but you may just find your niche with this
    kind of investment.

  zh: 微贷的最大吸引力之一是其相对较低的风险。然而，这并不意味着你会拥有 100% 的成功率。开始的最佳方式是从小额贷款开始。甚至只需 $100 就可以让你了解流程，并让你更熟悉该系统。微贷并不适合每个人，但你可能正好会找到这类投资中的适合自己的细分市场。
