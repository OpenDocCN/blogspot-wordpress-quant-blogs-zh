    by decreasing its reinvestment of the principal payments it receives from securities
    held in the System Open Market Account. Specifically, such payments will be reinvested
    only to the extent that they exceed gradually rising caps.

    will continue to decline in a gradual and predictable manner until the Committee
    judges that the Federal Reserve is holding no more securities than necessary to
    implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively.

- en: Under the subordinated balance sheet approach, once the change in reinvestment
    policy is triggered, the balance sheet would essentially be set on autopilot to
    shrink passively until it reaches a neutral level, expanding in line with the
    demand for currency thereafter. I favor an approach that would gradually and predictably
    increase the maximum amount of securities the market will be required to absorb
    each month, while avoiding spikes. Thus, in an abundance of caution, I prefer
    to cap monthly redemptions at a pace that gradually increases over a fixed period.
    In addition, I would be inclined to follow a similar approach in managing the
    reduction of the holdings of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities
    (MBS), calibrated according to their particular characteristics.
