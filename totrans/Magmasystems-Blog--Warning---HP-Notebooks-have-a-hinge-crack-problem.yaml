- en: When you call HP tech support, you are routed to a non-HP call center in Canada.
    Their job is to be the "gatekeepers" to the HP Case Managers, who are the people
    who determine whether your notebook should be repaired for non charge. After speaking
    to two levels of people at the call center, they have finally referred my problem
    to an HP case manager. They told me to expect a call anywhere from 24 to 72 hours.
