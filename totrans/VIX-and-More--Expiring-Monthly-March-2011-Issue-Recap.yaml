    publishes on the Monday following options expiration, the March issue was published
    a week ago today and is (still) available for subscribers to [download](https://www.expiringmonthly.com/customer/account/login/).'

- en: Note that the Expiring Monthly web site was recently overhauled to make for
    a better user experience, offer [archived articles](http://www.expiringmonthly.com/archives.html)
    and provide a better platform for further content enhancements. While I may be
    biased, there is no doubt it is a substantial improvement over the previous version
    of the web site.

    and is titled, A Multi-Dimensional Look at Implied Volatility: Several New Releases
    from the CBOE. My contribution is a complementary one: Evaluating Volatility Across
    Asset Classes. Among the other articles of interest is an interview with Jeff
    Augen, whose recent publications have helped to shed light on the workings of
    volatility, particularly at the end of the options expiration cycle and at earnings
    announcements.'

    issue of *Expiring Monthly*. That issue had a feature article on non-directional
    trading and some additional content related non-directional trading, including
    an article I authored for the diagnostically-oriented trader, which is titled,
    What Is a Non-Trending Market?
