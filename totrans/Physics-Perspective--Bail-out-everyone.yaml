- en: a couple years ago -- but that's all I did, wondered about it. The idea is that
    when banks need bailing out -- and sadly, we seem stuck with that problem for
    the moment -- we shouldn't bail them out directly, but indirectly. For example,
    just give every single person in the US $1,000\. Or maybe a voucher for $1,000
    that they have to spend somewhere, or put in a bank. This quickly amounts to $300
    billion infused into the economy, a large portion of which would end up in banks.
    So cash would be pumped into the banks too, but only through people first.

    off some of peoples' mortgages. The amount injected could be much larger. Perhaps
    similar funds would be injected directly into banks and other businesses as well.

- en: . But I'm quite surprised this is the first I've heard about any idea even remotely
    like this. It seems like a much better idea than just giving money to the bankers
    who created the problem in the first place. Why don't we hear more about such
    possibilities?
