    I believe that the road to recruiting the next generation of clients is involves
    a dual-track approach of financial education and instilling a passion for creating
    wealth. The latter is important because it shifts the attitude of the next generation
    from viewing the inheritance as consumption (the Paris Hilton symdrome) to wealth
    generation.

    of how to recruit the next generation of clients. By combining financial literacy
    education and an approach that instills a passion for creating wealth, her firm
    has made its AUM much stickier and fashioned an important tool to recruit older
    clients who are concerned about these issues of how to pass the family torch.
