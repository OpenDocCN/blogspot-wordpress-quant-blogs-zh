    for gold mining companies, where a gold mine could be modeled as a series of call
    options on gold, with the strike price being the cost of production.

    senior gold miners, it became evident that the industry has adopted a policy of
    mining lower grade ore in order to better preserve and extend the lives of their
    mines given the elevated price of gold. In all cases where the company reported
    the figures, the grade extracted has gone down. This is consistent with the observation
    by one analyst who commented that while cost per oz. has risen, cost per tonne
    of ore has remained relatively flat in the last few years.

- en: Are gold stocks cheap relative to bullion? If the market is only paying attention
    to cash flow (which is what it's doing right now) and not asset value, then the
    current practice of voluntarily raising production costs to extend mine life and
    optimize asset value is a great disappointment to investors. On the other hand,
    if an investor is willing to take the contrarian view that he is buying cheap
    assets then the group represents great value.

    investors do not value companies on asset value until we get into the later phase
    of the cycle, when inflationary expectations are high. However, if gold and gold
    mining stocks are to be viewed as inflation hedges then we have to be cautious
    that if runaway inflation rears its ugly head, then gold mining and production
    costs will rise because of higher commodity prices (e.g. energy, metals, etc.)
    The rise in production cost may serve to counteract the higher leverage that investors
    may have come to expect from gold mining stocks compared to bullion.

    An investor could be better off in just holding bullion, or a long dated deep-in-the-money
    call option on gold if he wants a leveraged inflation hedge vehicle.
