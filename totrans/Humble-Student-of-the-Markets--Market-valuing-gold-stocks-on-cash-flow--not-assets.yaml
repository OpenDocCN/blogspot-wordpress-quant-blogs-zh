    for gold mining companies, where a gold mine could be modeled as a series of call
    options on gold, with the strike price being the cost of production.

- en: Why did production costs rise? When I examined the past annual reports of the
    senior gold miners, it became evident that the industry has adopted a policy of
    mining lower grade ore in order to better preserve and extend the lives of their
    mines given the elevated price of gold. In all cases where the company reported
    the figures, the grade extracted has gone down. This is consistent with the observation
    by one analyst who commented that while cost per oz. has risen, cost per tonne
    of ore has remained relatively flat in the last few years.

- en: Are gold stocks cheap relative to bullion? If the market is only paying attention
    to cash flow (which is what it's doing right now) and not asset value, then the
    current practice of voluntarily raising production costs to extend mine life and
    optimize asset value is a great disappointment to investors. On the other hand,
    if an investor is willing to take the contrarian view that he is buying cheap
    assets then the group represents great value.

  zh: 相对于黄金而言，黄金股票是不是便宜？如果市场目前只关注现金流（它现在就是在这么做），而不是资产价值，那么目前自愿提高生产成本以延长矿井寿命和优化资产价值的做法对投资者来说是一个巨大的失望。另一方面，如果投资者愿意持相反观点，认为他正在购买便宜的资产，那么这个群体就代表了巨大的价值。

- en: My view comes down somewhere in the middle. Over the course of an economic cycle,
    investors do not value companies on asset value until we get into the later phase
    of the cycle, when inflationary expectations are high. However, if gold and gold
    mining stocks are to be viewed as inflation hedges then we have to be cautious
    that if runaway inflation rears its ugly head, then gold mining and production
    costs will rise because of higher commodity prices (e.g. energy, metals, etc.)
    The rise in production cost may serve to counteract the higher leverage that investors
    may have come to expect from gold mining stocks compared to bullion.

  zh: 我的观点介于两者之间。在一个经济周期中，直到周期的后期，投资者才会根据资产价值来评估公司。然而，如果黄金和黄金矿业股票被视为通胀对冲工具，那么我们必须谨慎，因为如果通胀失控，那么由于商品价格上涨（例如能源、金属等），黄金开采和生产成本会上升。生产成本的上升可能会对投资者可能从黄金矿业股票相对于黄金中期望的高杠杆产生抵消作用。
- en: In that case, gold stocks may not necessarily be such great bargains after all.
    An investor could be better off in just holding bullion, or a long dated deep-in-the-money
    call option on gold if he wants a leveraged inflation hedge vehicle.

  zh: 在这种情况下，黄金股票可能并不一定都是那么划算的买卖。如果一个投资者想要一个杠杆化的通胀对冲工具，他最好持有黄金，或者持有一个长期深度实值看涨期权。
