    of the past. We know that was wrong. Despite our best efforts, more financial
    crises are likely to occur. As we recover from the last one, we should prepare
    for the next.

    in a bell-shaped Gaussian curve, the distribution isn’t the standard normal distribution
    that we all learned in school. The distinguishing feature is that the tails are
    fatter, i.e. there is a higher probability of extreme events than assumed by the
    normal distribution model.

    tails, while a low kurtosis distribution has a more rounded peak and shorter thinner
    tails.” In other words, a kurtosis measure of zero indicates that returns are
    normally distributed, a negative kurtosis has thin tails while a positive kurtosis
    has fat tails.

    in their trading books. When I worked at a hedge fund, the risk manager explained
    to me that a kurtosis measure of 2-3 is somewhat acceptable, but if the kurtosis
    of a strategy were to balloon beyond 4 or so, they would get nervous because the
    possibility of extreme loss would be unacceptably high.

    by AGG, showed an astonishing level of kurtosis at 69.0\. Canadian bonds, which
    were less affected by the Lehman Crisis, were still relatively high at 5.1\. As
    a point of reference, I looked at the 10-year trailing kurtosis of the S&P 500
    before the Lehman Crisis and it came in at 2.1.

    of daily returns for the Dow Jones Industrials Average back to 1928 (so this analysis
    includes the Crash of 1929). It appears that these fat tailed episodes, or high
    kurtosis, aren’t unusual at all. In fact, the Lehman Crisis was just a blip compared
    to the Crash of 1987\. Periods of stability are followed by periods of instability,
    or [Minsky moments](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minsky_moment). ([John Maudlin](http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2010/03/what-does-greece-mean-to-you/)

    I shudder whenever someone says “this time it’s different.” Well, this time isn’t
    different, you just have to look back far enough in history. We experienced similar
    levels of macro-economic volatility back in the 60’s and 70’s. Unfortunately,
    most investment professionals weren’t in the business back then and may not be
    mentally equipped to deal with the new environment.
