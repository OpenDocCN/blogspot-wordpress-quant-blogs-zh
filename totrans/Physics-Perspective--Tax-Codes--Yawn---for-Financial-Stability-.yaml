    equal, the use of more leverage by banks, hedge funds and other investors creates
    more instability -- it can amplify small market fluctuations into far larger market
    upheavals. So stability would be improved by limiting leverage (although how much

    about incentives, particularly through the tax code (in the US). Currently, if
    a hedge fund seeks leverage by borrowing money, they pay interest on that loan
    and that interest can be deducted from their taxes. Interest payments are deductible.
    In contrast, if the same fund raises money by selling shares of its stock, they
    pay dividends on those shares. Those dividend payments are NOT deductible in US
    tax law. Hence, investing firms have every incentive to raise money for leverage
    by borrowing, rather than by selling stock.

    the use of leverage and keep it within the bounds of safety. For those interested
