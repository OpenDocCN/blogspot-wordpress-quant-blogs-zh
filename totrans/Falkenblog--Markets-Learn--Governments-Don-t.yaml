- en: Back in the housing bubble, the Community Reinvestment act required banks to
    meet community needs as a prerequisite for obtaining merger approvals from federal
    bank regulators, and by giving consumer and community groups the right to challenge
    these approvals the CRA provided these groups with leverage to bring banks to
    the negotiating table. Within a decade after the CRA was enacted, many banks created
    separate "community reinvestment" divisions that were often staffed by liberal
    individuals who sympathiszed with the aims of the community reeinventment movement.
    Indeed, some of these individuals had themselves been cummunity activitists who
    were recruited by banks to serve as liaisons with community groups. Activists
    pressured banks to invest more money in specific urban neighborhoods. Banks forged
    partnerships with community development corporations. See an Urban Studies professor's

    surely contributed to the debacle in a bad way. The lesson is yet another example
    of the law of unintended consequences. Trying to do good via indirect methods
    is very dangerous because the economy is a complex system, and when bad things
    happen as they often do, there's no accountability, no one in the political system
    got booted out of office for championing NINJA loans, while investors took it
    on the chin.

    service for less than $10 per month; (ii) personal computers, netbooks, or other

    a good one, as it doesn't help the minority language speakers, but merely adds
    to the resentment they feel and separates them further. There's nothing worse
    than government policy implemented via the back door like this, because it isn't
    free, it just adds to the already large amount of red tape that piles up on businesses.
