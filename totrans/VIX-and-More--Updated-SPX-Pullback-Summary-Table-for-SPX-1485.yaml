- en: One of the graphics that I receive many request for and is my SPX pullback summary
    table. This table starts with the bottom in the SPX in March 2009 and tracks all
    meaningful peak-to-trough pullbacks from various new highs in the SPX.

- en: Last week’s new high of SPX 1530.94 and this week’s selling have given me an
    excuse to update that table with current data – and I have taken the liberty of
    assuming that the SPX low of 1485.01 from earlier today holds up for now. Using
    this data, of the 19 pullbacks in the table below, the mean duration is 19 days
    and the mean pullback is 7.3%. For comparison sake, the medians are considerably
    lower at 7 days and a 5.6% drawdown.

    to 1420, while a median pullback would suggest a downside target of 1446\. Of
    course these are just averages; a repeat of the 21.6% pullback from 2011 would
    put the SPX back exactly at 1200.
