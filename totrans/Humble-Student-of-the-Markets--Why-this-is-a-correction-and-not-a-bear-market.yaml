    based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. In essence, it seeks
    to answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish)
    or contraction (bearish)?"

    have made it clear that they plan on being slow and gradual. Moreover, various
    Federal Reserve officials have indicated that they are tolerant of inflation being
    slightly over target in order to bring the economy back to full employment. So
    the Fed can hardly be characterized as being aggressive.
