    In other words, earnings declined before the market knew it, pushing P/Es higher.**

    US equity valuations are stretched. Although I believe that Bridgewater`s 3.6%

    expected returns are low.

    profits has slowed—earnings per share are up at only a 2.4% annualized rate in
    the past three months—even as PE multiples have increased. Investors are willing
    to pay more for a dollar of earnings because the earnings yield on equities (now
    about 5.5%) is significantly better than the yield on cash, and the risk of a
    recession is very low (negative real yields on cash plus a steep yield curve all
    but rule out a recession).
