    every instance where P/Es exceeded current levels was started by a *fall in earnings*.
    In other words, earnings declined before the market knew it, pushing P/Es higher.**

- en: I resolve this dilemma by differentiating between time horizons. Over the long-term,
    US equity valuations are stretched. Although I believe that Bridgewater`s 3.6%
    projected return is a tad on the low side, the point here is that long-term equity
    expected returns are low.

    higher in the short and medium term as long as non-inflationary growth holds up.
    US Q1 GDP growth was negative because of poor weather and we have seen signs of
    a rapid recovery.

    profits has slowed—earnings per share are up at only a 2.4% annualized rate in
    the past three months—even as PE multiples have increased. Investors are willing
    to pay more for a dollar of earnings because the earnings yield on equities (now
    about 5.5%) is significantly better than the yield on cash, and the risk of a
    recession is very low (negative real yields on cash plus a steep yield curve all
    but rule out a recession).
