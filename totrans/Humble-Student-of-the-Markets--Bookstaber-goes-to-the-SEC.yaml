    it would not be able to extract economic rents. So the incentives are to create
    innovative products that reduce market efficiency, not enhance it.

    informational asymmetries, by having products that are difficult for the users
    to understand and price. And, second, by designing innovative products, which,
    due to their non-standard nature, allow the banks to extract higher transaction
    costs.

- en: Innovative products are used to create return distributions that give a high
    likelihood of having positive returns at the expense of having a higher risk of
    catastrophic returns. Strategies that lead to a ‘make a little, make a little,
    make a little, …, lose a lot’ pattern of returns. If things go well for a while,
    the ‘lose a lot’ not yet being realized, the strategy gets levered up to become
    ‘make a lot, make a lot, make a lot,…, lose more than everything’, and viola,
    at some point the taxpayer is left holding the bag.

    and banks, my bet is we would see a bias toward short volatility, short gamma,
    short credit and short liquidity. All facilitated with innovative products – you
    can’t really do the first two without derivatives – and all leading to these sorts
    of return characteristics.

    in your business will focus the partners on the risk side of the business a lot
    more. Isn’t it funny that partnership based entities like legal and accounting
    firms generally don’t have the same problems as investment banking? The last time
    we had a big blowup (Arthur Anderson), we didn’t see accountants running to the
    government for a bailout.
