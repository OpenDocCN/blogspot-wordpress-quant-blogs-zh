    with because you think what they saying is more correct than others, so I don't
    find this a bad faith equilibrium. But on the other side, I do like listening
    to those I disagree with more on the radio drive time because invariably the host,
    and especially the callers, will come up with a horrible argument for their side.
    I much more enjoy listening to this when my intellectual adversaries are speaking
    than when someone says something stupid as an argument for something I agree with.
    That is, many (most?) people I agree with on taxes, abortion, affirmative action,
    war, etc., agree with me for reasons I don't think are correct or relevant.
