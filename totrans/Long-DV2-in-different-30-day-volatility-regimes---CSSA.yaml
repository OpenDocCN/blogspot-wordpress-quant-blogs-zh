    50dma environments. Our goal was to perform an intermediate-term time frame analysis
    using the 50 day moving average to represent the trend. Today I thought we would
    look at capturing something different: trading DV2 extremes within different 30-day
    volatility regimes using **DV Percentile Rank Volatility (DVPV**) and multiple
    holding periods. In terms of settings, we will define low volatility as DVPV<0.5
    and high volatility as DVPV>=0.5\. This gives us a larger sample size to draw
    from to make conclusions. First we shall examine the results from long trades
    (DV2 < 20).'

    with high uncertainty vs. those that are relatively calm. Throughout the entire
    holding period spectrum the high volatility environment beats low volatility for
    long trades and only begins to converge at the long 20 day holding period. The
    high volatility trades exhibit a consistent uptrend in average gains per trade
    as the holding period increases. The low volatility curve is similar but only
    increases significantly at holding periods higher than 7 days. Both are consistently
    profitable but the low volatility trades may not be robust to transaction costs.
    Thus when volatility is low, it may be best to avoid using the DV2, and focus
    on a more intermediate-term indicator such as the Super-Smoothed Double Stochastic
    (DVDS).

    of trades in the high volatility environment for holding periods under 10 days
    by a significant margin. However there is a clear deterioration in the DVR for
    the high volatility curve as holding periods increase while the low volatility
    trades show the opposite effect with DVR’s improving with longer holding periods.
    The deterioration for the high volatility trades is likely due to the fact higher
    volatility also tends to coincide with the SPY being below the 200ma. In contrast
    the observation that low volatility trades improve over time is likely due to
    the fact that this environment also tends to coincide with the SPY being above
    the 200ma.

    much less consistency in edge. Shorts in low volatility environments tend to exhibit
    consitently low positive returns across the holding period spectrum with no discernible
    trend in P/L, with the edge peaking out at the 4 and 10 day holding periods with
    an average trade of 0.32%. In high volatility the average gains are higher for
    the most part except at the long end where holding periods longer than 15 days
    show negative returns. As a whole, short trades remain still much less profitable
    than the long trades we looked at earlier. Lets take a look at the DVR to see
    what insights we can gain:'

    throughout the entire spectrum, with the optimal result falling within shorter
    time periods under 5 days. The high volatility trades start off with a high reward/risk
    for the 1-2 day hold backtests, but decay in an oscillating fashion as the holding
    period gets longer until the measure goes negative for holding periods greater
    than 15 days. It is very interesting to note the divergence in the pattern of
    risk-adjusted versus absolute returns for the high volatility environment. Effectively
    it may indicate that since volatility is highly cyclic it is not efficient to
    harvest it over longer time frames.
