I always found the line

['wish I didn't know now what I didn't know then'](http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=3286)

to be mystically profound (from

Against the Wind

), but had trouble of thinking of anything I could apply it to. Not knowing Santa was my dad? That an anthropomorphic god doesn't exist? That the sun will run out of fuel? Nothing seemed to fit.

But today I read about 77 year old Brady Bunch mom Florence Henderson

[getting crabs](http://www.theinsider.com/lol/42293_Say_What_Florence_Henderson_aka_Carol_Brady_Claims_John_Lindsay_Gave_Her_Crabs/)

from a one night stand with then NYC mayor John Lindsey.

> when she went home later that night, she woke up to "little black things" covering her body. She says she called her doctor who told her she had pubic lice.

I didn't need to know that.
