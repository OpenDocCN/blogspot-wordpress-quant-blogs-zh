    Yesterday I showed a study that suggested a bullish bias following a negative
    SPX day where the SOX thrives. Below is a similar test using the BKX instead of

    too few here to draw any solid conclusions. It does appear worthwhile to keep
    an eye on the BKX as well as the SOX, though. Interesting about this study is
    that there were two occurrences in 2008\. They were on 1/22/08 and 10/10/08\.
    Both near notable market lows.
