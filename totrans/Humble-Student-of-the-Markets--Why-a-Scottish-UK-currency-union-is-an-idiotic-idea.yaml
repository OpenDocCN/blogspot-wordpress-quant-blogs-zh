    also freely used as a second currency in many countries around the world. However,
    the HKMA does not have a seat at FOMC meetings and the Fed does not take into
    consideration the effects of its monetary policy decisions on HK or other countries
    that use the USD. Hong Kong tycoons are acutely aware of US monetary policy. At
    times, Hong Kong may either be importing either inflation or deflation from the
    US depending on the differential in growth rates.
