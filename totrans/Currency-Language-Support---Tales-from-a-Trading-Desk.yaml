- en: As Anatole states in his “Go for the Money! JSR 354 Adds First Class Money and
    Currency Support to Java” post, support for monetary values is painful.  In the
    financial community, there should be a cheer to see that once JSR 354 is finalised
    in Q1 2015, development of complex currency applications e.g FX Single Dealer
    Platforms, should get a little easier.

    on Java 7, we plan a forward-compatible backport once the JSR is final.
