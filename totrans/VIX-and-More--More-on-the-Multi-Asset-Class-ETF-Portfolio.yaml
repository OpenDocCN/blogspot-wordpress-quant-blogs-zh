    brought such a positive response that I thought a brief follow-up is in order.

- en: In the chart below, courtesy of [ETFreplay.com](http://etfreplay.com/), I show
    how the Multi-Asset Class ETF Portfolio I referred to yesterday performed on a
    month to month basis, this time using the ETFreplay’s [Portfolio Moving Average
    timeline tool](http://etfreplay.com/members/timeline_portfolioma.aspx). The chart
    is really a table which shows all of the ETFs and the results of the moving average
    rule which determined whether to be long or in cash for each month of the period
    covered. The far right portion of that graphic also shows where the each of the
    individual ETFs currently stands relative to their selected (in this case it was
    six months) moving average.  Finally, the column graph toward the bottom also
    shows what percentage of the total ETF portfolio was long in each month.

    based on fundamental data. My suggestion was to check out [Portfolio123.com](http://www.portfolio123.com/),
    which is the site discussed in the bottom of the links below.
