    During that period, we've seen below average buying pressure (the zero level is
    average) and more than average selling pressure (values below zero show heavier
    selling). That suggests that more stocks have been trading on downticks than upticks,
    even as the broad market average has risen to new highs. This is the first divergence

    389 touched fresh one-month lows. Volume in SPY has also been unusually low during
    the past several sessions. Since 2013, when SPY volume has been in its lowest
    quartile, the next ten days in SPY have averaged a loss of -.08%. When volume

    performance, and the underlying past positivity of the US long leading indicators
