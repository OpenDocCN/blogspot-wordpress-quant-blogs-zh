- en: Today was a very unusual day in the land of [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures).
    As the VIX futures [term structure](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/term%20structure)
    graphic below shows, the volatility futures moved upward at a rate that was roughly
    equal across the next eight expiration months.

  zh: 今天在[VIX期货](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures)的土地上是一个非常不寻常的日子。如下图所示，VIX期货[期限结构](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/term%20structure)图形中，波动性期货在接下来八个到期月份的上升速度大致相当。
- en: With the front month VIX futures 45% above the lifetime average in the VIX,
    one would anticipate that expectations regarding [mean reversion](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/mean%20reversion)
    would significantly dampen the rise in VIX futures prices in the more distant
    expirations, much like the pattern I [posted about](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/08/todays-jump-in-vix-futures-term.html)
    two weeks ago and on many [previous occasions](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/05/vix-futures-one-picture-to-remember.html).
    In fact, with the VIX this high, I don’t ever recall seeing the back month VIX
    futures keeping up with the front month futures in any substantial increase in
    the VIX.

  zh: 当VIX的当月期货比VIX的历史平均值高出45%时，人们会预期关于[均值回归](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/mean%20reversion)的预期会在更远的到期月份显著抑制VIX期货价格的上涨，就像我两周前[发布的](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/08/todays-jump-in-vix-futures-term.html)模式和之前的许多[场合](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/05/vix-futures-one-picture-to-remember.html)。实际上，VIX达到如此高水平时，我不记得有哪次远月VIX期货能跟上当月期货在VIX大幅上涨中的任何实质性增加。
- en: If you are on the fence about becoming a [survivalist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivalism)
    and are looking for a sign, look no farther than the VIX futures, which are predicting
    daily changes in the S&P 500 index of more than 2% at least one out of every three
    days, starting in October and extending out at least as far as VIX futures are
    quoted, which is through April 2011\. In order to reach their current January
    valuation, the VIX would have to rise more than six points (23%) in the next 4
    ½ months or so. Another way of looking at the expectations for a jump in volatility
    would be to consider that the current 20-day historical volatility in the SPX
    would have to double from the current level of 16.70 in order to make these VIX
    futures predictions pan out.

  zh: 如果你在成为[生存主义者](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivalism)的问题上犹豫不决，并且正在寻找一个信号，只需看看VIX期货就知道了，这些期货预测S&P
    500指数每日变化超过2%至少三分之一的时间，从十月份开始，至少到VIX期货报价截止的2011年4月。为了达到目前的 January估值，VIX在未来大约四点五个月的时间里必须上涨六点（23%）以上。另一种看待波动性跳升预期的方法是考虑，SPX的当前20日历史波动率必须从当前的16.70点翻倍，才能使这些VIX期货预测成真。

    VIX futures and the [VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX) ETN,
    don’t forget [VXZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXZ), the iPath
