## Innovation back in Financial Services?

Startups are giving financial services a good kicking from a retention and hiring perspective.  Everyone wants to be in a startup, live the dream, be involved in a cool product, and hopefully be rewarded appropriately.  Wall Street and Technology has had a number of [articles](http://www.wallstreetandtech.com/data-management/bny-mellon-aims-to-tap-data-science-talent-in-silicon-valley/d/d-id/1317800) this year offering insight into the innovation that financial services is driving to not only re-build the sector, but also I suspect to keep staff engaged.  BNY Mellon and Fidelity are the two [recently](http://www.wallstreetandtech.com/infrastructure/technology-innovation-returns-to-financial-services/a/d-id/1318251) called out, but a quick google will provide some insight into the money being invested into startups by the top 10 or so banks.  Interesting times both within financial services and outside.
