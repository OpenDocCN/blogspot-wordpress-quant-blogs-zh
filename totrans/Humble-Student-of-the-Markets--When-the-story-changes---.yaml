    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    signal. A bullish Trend Model signal that gets less bullish is a trading "sell"
    signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading
    "buy" signal. The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of
    the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. The turnover rate
    of the trading model is high, and it has varied between 150% to 200% per month.

    some headwinds. Although the tax changes are poorly conceived, and mostly benefit
    high income earners, there should be some short term boost to economic growth.
    That might lead the Federal Reserve to raise rates a little quicker than anticipated.

    it comes alongside a pickup in growth, notes Sheets. But it’s the prospect of
    an inflection point away from the dominant narrative of “synchronized global growth”
    reflected in rising PMIs, and moribund price pressures that could cause investors
    angst.
