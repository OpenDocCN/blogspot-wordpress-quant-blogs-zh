    I introduced something I called the [OHFdex](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/OHFdex)
    or listing of Overripe High Fliers, along with 14 [CandleGlance](http://stockcharts.com/charts/indices/)
    charts from StockCharts.com for the highest fliers.

    ripe for decimation. CROCS ([CROX](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=CROX)) is down
    over 97% in a year, Las Vegas Sands ([LVS](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=lvs))
    is down 90%, and both DryShips ([DRYS](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=drys)) and
    VMware ([VMW](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=vmw)) are down more than 80%. All told,
    11 of the 14 former high fliers are down 50% or more. The mean decline was 67.7%
    and the median decline was 69.3%. The best performer among the group was Baidu
    ([BIDU](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=bidu)), the Chinese search engine company,
    which has lost 36% while the Chinese markets have fallen 57%.

    to create a new list of oversold stocks that can prosper over the course of the
    next year.
