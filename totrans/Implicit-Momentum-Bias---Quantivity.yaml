    finance bloggers go?](http://abnormalreturns.com/where-did-all-the-finance-bloggers-go/)
    A variety of folks gave thoughtful replies: [Josh Brown](http://www.thereformedbroker.com/2012/10/23/where-did-all-the-finance-bloggers-go-my-theories/),
    [Flex Salmon](http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2012/10/23/did-the-financial-blogosphere-go-away/),
    [David Merkel](http://alephblog.com/2012/10/24/why-i-love-blogging/), [Scott Bell](http://iheartwallstreet.com/2012/10/24/why-i-stopped-blogging/),
    the [Macro Men](http://macro-man.blogspot.com/2012/10/introspection-day.html),
    and bunch of [anonymous professional traders](http://www.rmdfx.com/2012/10/24/prominent-market-players-talk-about-this-market-enviroment/).
    Undoubtedly, there is truth in all their observations.'

    momentum bias*.'

    “momentum”, I intend a sustained trend, whether conceptual or technical. By “implicit
    bias”, I intend a cognitive preference which is rarely stated and often partially
    or fully unconscious.

    discretionary strategies which boil down to technical momentum, whether conceived
    explicitly (*e.g.* ad hoc moving average strategies or more arcane technical analysis
    voodoo) or implicitly (*e.g.* cocktail party stock tips or watching CNBC). Thus,
    the vast majority of retail exhibit this bias.'

    also essentially boil down to technical momentum, either due to stock picking
    or executing strategies aligned with historically strong long-term risk-adjusted
    returns of momentum. This is exemplified by a quick scan of the [Top Papers](http://hq.ssrn.com/rankings/Ranking_display.cfm?TRN_gID=10&requesttimeout=900)
    from SSRN, for which 2 of 10 top are momentum papers (followed by lots more of
    varying sophistication). Thus, majority of asset managers exhibit this bias.'

    are essentially momentum dressed in sophisticated clothing, often tracking one
    or more risk premia (whether due to anomalies or market structure) rather than
    raw prices. This is nicely exemplified by Ilmanen’s well-reviewed [Expected Returns](http://www.amazon.com/Expected-Returns-Investors-Harvesting-Rewards/dp/1119990726),
    who now works at AQR. Thus, many hedge funds exhibit this bias.'

    is happening”, which almost always occurs in strongly trending markets: bubbles
    or crashes. In contrast, range-bound markets are often remarked to be “boring”
    or “frustrating”, with corresponding tanking in ratings. Thus, mainstream media
    exhibits this bias.'

- en: '**Blogs / Twitter**: building readership depends on establishing a distinctive
    perspective or “voice”, enabling a blog or stream to stand out amongst all the
    noise. This demands the corresponding content to be formulaic in some predictable
    sense. Blogs have an even higher bar than Twitter, as blogs are expected to hold
    up as being “good” despite hindsight bias—meaning their shelf life must extend
    until they are read at some indeterminate point in the future. [Falkenblog](http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/)
    is a good example, which has been a tireless advocate of the low-vol anomaly for
    many years. Thus, many blogs and twitter exhibit this bias.'

    that span many years, invariably including both trending and range-bound regimes.
    Invariably, majority of both alpha and beta strategies perform best in momentum-driven
    trending markets, of which the past 30 years have mostly been; those strategies
    that perform well in range markets often are regime-aware, and trade different
    across regimes. Careful review of nearly all popular tactical and dynamic asset
    allocation strategies exhibit this (along with many exhibiting a pervasive, unstated
    bias from the 30-year bond bull run). Thus, alpha research often exhibits this
    bias.'

    confirmation bias. Simply put, humans “like to be right”: enjoying and finding
    comfort in writing and reading information that confirms their existing beliefs
    or hypotheses (scientifically attributable to stimulus-response dopamine effects).'

    conceived as directional bets. For them, *their momentum bias generates significant
    pain in markets like this—which makes them tune-out*. This is also seen in hedge
    funds, which in aggregate have a comparatively poor record in range-bound markets.
    In contrast, many computers find enjoyment in markets which generally defy non-quantitative
    directional prediction.
