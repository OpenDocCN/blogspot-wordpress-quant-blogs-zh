- en: During the last few evenings I’ve been doing some work with Scala.  Initially
    I started off with [Eclipse](http://scala-ide.org/docs/user/gettingstarted.html)
    as the IDE of choice.  But after remember how much I dislike Eclipse, I moved
    over to [IntelliJ](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).  I prefer IntelliJ’s refactoring
    support, but for some reason just found the run/debug particularly painful with
    Scala, so ended up reverting back to Eclipse.  With [ScalaIDE](http://scala-ide.org/docs/user/gettingstarted.html)
    installed, and thus Scala 2.9.2, I experienced the frustration of creating a [Maven](http://www.stupiphany.org/?p=10)
    Scala project, and finding the MySpec test failed to build.  It turned out, either
    rightly or wrongly, that the solution was to correct 😦 the pom.xml for the scala-library,
    junit and specs.  [Specs](http://code.google.com/p/specs/) probably being the
    key, and hence moving to [Specs2](http://etorreborre.github.com/specs2/).  Which
    leads me to the previously blogged view, IDE’s and versions are still to painful
    in 2012.  It just shouldn’t be this hard to get an environment running and start
    development. 😦

    Specs2 1.12.1
