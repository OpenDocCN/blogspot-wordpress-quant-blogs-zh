    2% gain was followed by a gap up of at least 1%.  Today we are seeing another
    1% gap up, but this time it is on the heels of a 2% loss.  So I thought it would
    be interesting to examine this scenario.  Results of the last test suggested the
    open to close action favored a move lower, which is what played out on Tuesday.
     Below is the general stats for setups like today.

    upside edge.  Let's take a look at the list of instances to see if we can learn
    anything more.

    within 1.5% of its open.  Volatility after the bell was huge.  Traders looking
    for intraday moves should have plenty of action today.
