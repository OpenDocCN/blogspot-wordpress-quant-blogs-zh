- en: '**Modeling: Price and Risk Models** *We model the equity market as an open,
    irreversible, far from equilibrium thermodynamic model subject to dynamic constraints.
    This approach results in a bi-linear model composed of two dynamical sub-models:
    price evolution and risk evolution. The price evolution sub-model represents the
    behavior of pricing of commodities and a market aggregate as a function of exogenous
    demand and control actions. The risk sub-model represents the behavior of risk
    as a function of exogenous uncertainty and actions. Further, the risk sub-model
    represents the uncertainty range of the values computed by the price evolution
    model.*'
