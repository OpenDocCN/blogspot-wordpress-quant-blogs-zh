    Fed vice-chair Alan Blinder stated that the current environment may create greater
    uncertainty about Fed actions going forward as an active debate about the sequencing
    process of QE withdrawal starts to heat up. Blinder explained it this way in a

    a few years, that there would be some draw down of the size of the portfolio before
    any interest rate increases. A number of Fed spokesman have started, either tacitly
    or very explicitly, backing away from that and saying that is now under reconsideration
    and so on. ***It is clear that that is up to debate inside the Federal Reserve,
    whether interest rates will start going up first or the balance sheet will start
    shrinking first, but that is a subtle issue of timing.*** And as we think of the
    exit proceeding over months and years, it is clear that both have to happen. The
    Fed is not going to stay at near-zero interest rates as the economy strengthens
    and the Fed is not going to stay with a $4.5 trillion balance sheet as the economy
    strengthens.

    be in this week's statement. My expectation is that Yellen sticks to the fairly
    dovish tune she has been singing.*** If there are clues that the tenor of the
    tune is changing I think they would be subtle. Watch for any language from Yellen
    regarding proximity to goals, optimism on the JOLTS numbers, or references to
    inflation bottoming out and turning higher. These would be hints that the Fed
    is increasingly concerned of the possibility of falling behind the curve. Such
    talk would also hint at the possibility that the new Board members seek to edge
    policy in a different direction.
