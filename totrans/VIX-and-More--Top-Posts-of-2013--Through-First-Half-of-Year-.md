# VIX and More: Top Posts of 2013 (Through First Half of Year)

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2013/07/top-posts-of-2013-through-first-half-of.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2013/07/top-posts-of-2013-through-first-half-of.html#0001-01-01)

Every year I tabulate the most-read posts in this space as I find this exercise to be an excellent way to identify the issues that are resonating with readers and also to see how these issues evolve over time. These most-read posts also serve as easily accessible repositories of high-quality material for the benefit of new readers and long-term readers alike.

A number of themes seem to be top of mind for 2103 so far. Clearly the [VIX ETPs](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20ETN) and their construction and valuation quirks continue to be a huge issue, as is their performance during various volatility regimes. On a related note, low volatility ETPs generated considerable press and interest toward the beginning of the year and as volatility picked up in the second quarter, readers gravitated toward information on [VIX spikes](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20spikes) and various ways to measure and evaluate [risk](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/risk).

The posts below represent those that have been read by the highest number of unique readers during the first half of 2013\. Farther down there are links to similar lists going back to 2008, along with several other “best of” type posts that I have flagged for [archival](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/archival) purposes.

For the record, each year I also attach the [hall of fame](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/hall%20of%20famehttp:/vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/01/week-in-vix-january-7-2007-introduction.html) label to a handful of posts that I believe have particularly compelling and/or original content, regardless of readership.
