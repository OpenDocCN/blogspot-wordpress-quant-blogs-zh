- en: There have been some strong moves up this morning (and yesterday) in stocks
    that matter to my Capitulative Breadth Indicator(CBI). It will almost certainly
    close at 3 or lower this afternoon (down from 7). This will signal a fairly quick
    end to the trade. It is important to understand that the drop in the CBI does
    NOT indicate the rally attempt will fail. Rather it indicates the capitulative
    excess has been reduced. The bounce I was looking for arrived. I will be taking
    profits before the end of the day.
