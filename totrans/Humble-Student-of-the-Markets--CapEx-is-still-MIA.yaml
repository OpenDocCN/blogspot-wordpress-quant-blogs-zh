    investing in fresh projects as the U.S. economy gains pace, a move that can further
    help along economic growth. Acquisitions have about doubled in the U.S. from last
    year to a recent $1.1 trillion, and U.S. bond sales earmarked for capital spending—purchases
    or upgrades of long-lived assets such as plant and equipment—have risen 90% from
    a year earlier to $40 billion, Dealogic said.

    returns on capital in the mid to high teens. The long-term expected rate of the
    equity markets, is roughly half that. And when corporations embarked on massive
    buybacks across all industries and all companies, in effect these CEOs are buying
    the stock market. ***So what they’re telling you then, is unequivocally that they
    think that either they’re happy to earn the stock market rate of return or maybe
    something hopefully better. Or their rate of return on the margin of any new capital
    project is much much lower, in fact half or less of what is stated. And that does
    not bode well for the future of profits, or for the quality of earnings reported

    companies are buying their R+D or their capital, and that should [be] properly
    deducted from cash flow, because in aggregate corporate America is not growing***.
    So by buying each other and buying divisions of each other, in effect, they’re
    capitalizing their R+D … and that particularly applies for big tech, which are
    perceived as very cheap companies. If you actually look at them, the only reason
    their revenues aren't declining at a reasonable rate is because they’re buying
