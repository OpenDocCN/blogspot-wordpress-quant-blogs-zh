    that works really well for me. I hope you will find it useful.

    posts and after searching WordPress support, I found [LaTeX](http://en.support.wordpress.com/latex/)
    tag. It sounds simple: embed your equation’s LaTeX syntax like this **$****latex
    your-latex-code-here$**.'

    application that can render LaTeX with preview pane. [LEd](http://www.latexeditor.org/)
    looked promising until I realized that I would need to install an additional LaTeX
    typesetting, like MiKTeX – a whooping 160 MB.

    works perfectly. It has buttons at the top for different operators and formulas
    and more importantly it renders, very fast, the formula as you type it.
