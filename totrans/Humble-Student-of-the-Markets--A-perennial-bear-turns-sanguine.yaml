- en: I shudder whenever someone proclaims that we are entering a New Era, or this
    time it’s different. There are certain things in life that I have come to depend
    on, such as a bearish Stephen Roach, the chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia and former
    global strategist. His writing used to be so depressing that you had to read King
    Lear to cheer up. He was such a perennial bear that I used to joke with my Morgan
    Stanley sales contact that Morgan Stanley needed to throw a huge party when he
    turned bullish.

    that this perennial bear is turning sanguine.

    a growth-starved world and there are signs that the Middle Kingdom economy may
    be at risk. The Chinese economy has shown signs of growing a property bubble.

- en: Unlike policy circles in the West, where there is no appetite to pre-empt bubbles
    and crises, China views these risks very differently. In the depths of the Asian
    financial crisis of the late 1990s, the Chinese leadership first adopted a “pro-active”
    policy strategy—a forward-looking approach that relies on the combination of fiscal,
    monetary, and regulatory tools to lean against bubbles and financial crises.

    and again in the Great Crisis of 2008–09, he continues. In fact, Chinese authorities
    repeatedly have stressed pre-emptive policy discipline over the reactive self-regulation
    practiced in the West. “Bubbles, and the imbalances they spawn, were to be addressed
    early rather than after the fact”.
