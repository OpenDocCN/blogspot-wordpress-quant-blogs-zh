- en: With the VIX at lows, and central banks across the globe printing money at breakneck
    pace, it seems a great time to be long equities. Not that I think this is good
    for the long run, but for at least a couple years this should be great for equities.

    to investors with large gains taking their capital gains before 2013 when such
    capital gains rates will go up.

    central banks across the world have this as their priority, I think once bank

    again, M2 will explode, and prices will rise. First in assets.
