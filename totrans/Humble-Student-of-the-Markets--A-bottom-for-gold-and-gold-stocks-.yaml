    shortest-term gold market timers tracked by the Hulbert Financial Digest (as measured
    by the Hulbert Gold Newsletter Sentiment Index, or HGNSI).

- en: When I wrote about gold sentiment two months ago, this average stood at 16.7%.
    Today, in contrast, it is at minus 14.8%, which means that the average gold timer
    is now allocating about a seventh of his gold-oriented portfolio to shorting the
    market.

    lower to minus 15.7%, its current level is the lowest it’s been since March 2009,
    more than three years ago.

    slightly above $900 an ounce.

- en: Does this mean that gold and gold stocks are set to bottom? Not yet, according
    to my long-term measures of greed and fear. Consider, for example, the silver-to-gold
    ratio. Silver has long been regarded as a high-beta play on gold. The chart below
    of this ratio shows that while sentiment has descended from levels indicating
    excessive bullishness, they are not at levels consistent with a long-term bottom
    yet.

    and junior resource stocks. The chart below shows the ratio of the TSX Venture
    Index, which is comprised mainly of junior resource companies, against the more
    senior and established TSX Composite. This relative return ratio also tells the
    story of falling speculative fever, but readings are not at levels consistent
    with capitulation bottoms. (Note that the scale of this chart is 13 years, which
    is the amount of history available, compared to the silver/gold ratio above that
    has a 20 year history.)

    gold bullion ratio.  While we are nearing levels where a meaningful bottom can
    be established, readings are not at screaming buy levels yet.

    conditions? Assuming the market responds the way it typically has done in the
    past, the wait could be as much as several more weeks.

    three decades. ***Its greatest explanatory power in predicting the market’s subsequent
    direction existed at the three-month horizon.***

- en: These readings are suggestive of a tradable short-term bottom in gold and gold
    stocks is coming up, but a long or even intermediate term bottom may have to wait.
    Given that gold prices are deflating in the wake of the French and Greek elections,
    that short-term bottom may be fast approaching.

    how much risk I am willing to take. My inner investor tells me that there is value
    at current levels and I can accumulate positions, but there may be better entry points
    down the road.
