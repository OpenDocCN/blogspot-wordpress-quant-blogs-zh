    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    signal. A bullish Trend Model signal that gets less bullish is a trading "sell"
    signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading
    "buy" signal. The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of
    the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. Past trading of
    the trading model has shown turnover rates of about 200% per month.

    view) to be ripe for a financial-asset bubble. That is, as weakness abroad drives
    yields lower in the U.S., stocks and real estate look increasingly attractive.
    Stocks have clearly benefited from this “reach for yield,” as have certain types
    of higher-risk bonds.

    assets seem to be the only yield game in town. Investors are rewarded with the
    additional bonus of steady US growth. Stocks should benefit as falling UST yields
    translate into P/E expansion.

    maybe, [San Francisco](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-i-bought-a-condo-in-san-francisco-for-268000-2016-07-05)).
    But could we be there? I am not certain, but here in Southern California the chatter
    is starting to get a little crazy again. As rents rise rapidly and future returns
    on stocks and bonds just don’t look that great, many people are turning to real
    estate.
