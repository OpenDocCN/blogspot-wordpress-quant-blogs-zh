    support level but the support violation turned out to be a fake-out as the bulls
    staged a last stand with a rally that lasted about two months. The waterfall then
    began after the rally fizzled out.

    support in early October, but the bears had their faces ripped off by a rally.
    The rally is now appearing to petering itself out. If history were to repeat itself,
    then the market will break its early October lows in early December and panic
    selloff will then begin.

    along the lines of the one that began in the U.S. subprime mortgage market four
    years ago. That is, a problem that authorities assured us was "contained" (the
    Bernank's famous last word) and resolvable has morphed into one that is uncontained
    and more dangerous by the day.

    of the missing $600 million in segregated account funds. Indeed, a look at the
    relative performance of the Broker-Dealer Index against the market shows the XBD
    to be underperforming, just as it did in 2008 leading up to the Lehman Crisis.
    In fact, the rally that began in early October 2011 only showed up as a blip as
    the XBD remained in a relative downtrend dating back to January 2011\.
