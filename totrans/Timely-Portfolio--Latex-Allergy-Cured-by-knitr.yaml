- en: I have always known that at some point I would have to succumb to the power
    of Latex, but Latex has been uncharacteristically intimidating to me.  I finally
    found the remedy to my Latex allergy with the amazing and fantastic [knitr package](http://yihui.name/knitr/)
    from Yihui Xie.  With very minimal effort, I ran my first experiment and now am
    extremely excited to incorporate it in production-quality performance reports
    (I plan to document the steps to get there in future posts).

    up and running is to [install LyX](http://wiki.lyx.org/Windows/Windows), which
    will also install [MikTex](http://www.miktex.org/).  If these are successfully
    installed, then you should be ready to experiment with knitr in R.

- en: I will use knitr’s stich function, which is clearly not designed for the robust
    production use of knitr, but makes for a very easy first test.  stitch will open
    a very short script, apply a template, and generate a Sweave style .Rnw (can be
    changed).  knit2pdf converts the .Rnw file into a pdf, and with a couple lines
    of code you get [a remarkable result](http://www.box.com/shared/fdcc4483e733f9b00c44).
