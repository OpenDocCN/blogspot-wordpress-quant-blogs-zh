- en: Back in the day when I was a long-only equity portfolio manager, the market
    would occasionally get hit with emerging market crises. On one occasion, I can
    remember being in investment meetings discussing how to tweak our stock picking
    quant models in light of such an event. A manager on the emerging market team
    made the astute comment that you couldn't possibly model the stocks in a country
    undergoing a crisis based on anything but technical analysis. At inflection points,
    it is the technical factors start working first, followed by fast moving fundamental
    models like estimate revision, then fundamental factors like growth and value.

    I moved my quantitative equity market-neutral portfolio to an all-cash position.
    I recognized that no quant model was going to work very well in that situation.
    The fundamental ratios would be all outdated and no sane person would trade off
    them, but no one quite knew what earnings estimates were until the dust had settled.

    on the upside. Market psychology can be revealing, especially when it rallies

    the same as recently. Consumer-related indicators - mortgages, oil and gas, jobless
    claims, and consumer spending - all remain positive. But those portions of the
    US economy most exposed to global forces, including the US$, commodities, and
    industrial production and transportation, are all firmly negative. Employment

    Should we get dovish noises from the Fed at their next FOMC meeting, then it will

    that the probability of a December rate hike is rising, then Dollar bulls will
    have the wind at their backs. Right now, the consensus is that the chances of
    a December liftoff are fading, which is negative for the USD and positive for
    the earnings outlook of large cap US multi-nationals.
