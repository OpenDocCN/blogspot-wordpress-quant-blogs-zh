![](img/241163be19d2d6e5adec0c71bdbdad47.png)[Credit Derivatives Research](http://www.creditresearch.com/) has a Counterparty Risk Index (and a number of related sub-indices) which calculates the average credit spread of the 15 largest credit derivative dealers. Following the recent turmoil in the credit markets, the index now stands more than 50% higher than the previous March 2008 high.

Not surprisingly, the [Markit](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Markit) CDX ([credit default swap](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/credit%20default%20swaps)) indices are seeing similar spikes.
