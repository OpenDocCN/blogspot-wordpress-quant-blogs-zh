    provoked by pain. Investment positions are sold when they have declined enough
    to trigger fear or panic. Investment positions are purchased in a rush to “catch”
    or “ride” them. My impression is that the single best mark of a reactive investor
    is the tendency to measure investment success by the amount gained or lost on
    any particular day.'

    than on daily outcomes. That doesn't mean ignoring outcomes, but it means following
    a specific, well-studied discipline with the expectation that the results will
    emerge through repeated application. As usual, those results are best measured
    in terms of long-term return and risk over the complete market cycle.

    in his models and indicators and adjusts his portfolio according to a discipline.
