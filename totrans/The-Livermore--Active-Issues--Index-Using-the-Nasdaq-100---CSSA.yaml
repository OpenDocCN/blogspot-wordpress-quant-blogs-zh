- en: The Livermore “Active Issues” Index is a new universal index methodology that
    can be applied to find the best liquid momentum stocks in any index. It is “bias-free”
    and is ideal for trend trading in all time frames. No fundamental data has been
    incorporated, only price and volume data and statistics. It can also be used as
    a passive way to create alpha by hedging using its underlying index ETF for high
    risk adjusted returns that are uncorrelated to the RSI2 or DV2 and other short-term
    strategies.  Welcome to the new and improved IBD100!   *performance data to be
