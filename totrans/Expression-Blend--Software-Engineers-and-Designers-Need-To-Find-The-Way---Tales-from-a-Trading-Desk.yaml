- en: I know I’ve made this point some time ago (a long time), but both designers
    and software engineers need to embrace Expression Blend and likewise Catalyst
    (in the Flex world) and not be afraid to leverage new tools. Additionally, both
    Expression Blend users need to feedback to Microsoft on the improvements they
    feel need to be made in the Expression Blend vNext. Here at Lab49, we collated
    over 50+ items that we felt should be in future release of Expression Blend, and
    sent them to the Microsoft Expression development team.
