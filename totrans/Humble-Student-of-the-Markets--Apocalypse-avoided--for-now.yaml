- en: In the last week, the bulls did manage to rally the markets and achieve a stalemate
    with the bears, which is a victory of sorts. Take a look at the price of Dr. Copper,
    which rallied up through the downtrend line but ended the week lower. This may
    be a signal of underlying strength and a sideways pattern rather than a continuation
    of the downtrend. Nevertheless, a “dark cross” is imminent in copper prices indicating
    the development of an intermediate term downtrend.

    through the downtrend line but weakened again which points to a possible sideways
    consolidation pattern.
