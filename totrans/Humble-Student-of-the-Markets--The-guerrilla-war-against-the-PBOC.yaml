- en: In the wake of the news of the coronavirus infection, the Chinese leadership
    went into overdrive and made it a Draghi-like "whatever it takes" moment to prevent
    panic and stabilize markets. When the stock markets opened after the Lunar New
    Year break, the authorities prohibited short sales, directed large shareholders
    not to sell their holdings, and the PBOC turned on their firehose of liquidity
    to support the stock market. Those steps largely succeeded. China's stock markets
    stabilized and recovered, and so too the markets of China's Asian trading partners.

  zh: 在冠状病毒感染的消息之后，中国领导层加大了力度，并将其视为一场如德拉吉般的“不惜一切代价”的时刻，以防止恐慌和稳定市场。在春节假期后股市开盘时，当局禁止了空头交易，指示大股东不要出售他们的持股，中国人民银行开启流动性“水龙头”来支持股市。这些措施
    largely 成功了。中国股市稳定并恢复，中国亚洲交易伙伴的市场也是如此。
- en: However, there were signs that the market is unimpressed by the steps taken
    by Beijing to control the outbreak and limit its economic impact. Market participants
    were conducting a guerrilla campaign against the PBOC by using Mao Zedong's principles
    of war. The first principle is "When the enemy advances, we retreat."

  zh: 然而，有迹象表明，市场对北京为控制疫情和限制其经济影响所采取的步骤并不买账。市场参与者正在运用毛泽东的战争原则对中国人民银行（PBOC）进行游击战。“敌进我退”是第一原则。
- en: Indeed, when the PBOC flooded the market with liquidity, stock prices went up.
    But that's not the entire story.
