I will be on a panel at the 2008 Web Services/SOA on Wall Street show on Monday, February 11th.

The panel starts at 11:00 AM, and goes for about 45-50 minutes. Topics of interest are the increasing use of blogs, Wikis, LinkedIn, Facebook, etc on Wall Street.

*Warning: Since I grew up on the tough streets of Jamaica, Queens, be warned that, if you throw tomatoes at me, you do so at your own risk.*

Here is a blurb about the panel:

**Beyond Web 2.0...What Enterprise 2.0 Is...And What It Means For Wall Street** 

Beyond Web 2.0, Enterprise 2.0 is about deploying these new technologies and social practices in a corporate business context.

This session will explore the drivers pushing Enterprise 2.0 adoption, survey relevant technologies, and discuss how Wall Street and the financial markets are benefitting.
