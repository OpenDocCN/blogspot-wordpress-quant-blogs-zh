## DGX: Real-Time Cash and Derivatives Market Data Clud Platform

[SuperDerivatives](http://www.finextra.com/News/Announcement.aspx?pressreleaseid=47717), a provider of [derivatives](http://www.sdgm.com/NewsAndEvents/~/media/Files/PDFs/In%20the%20press/2012/FX-MM_Sept2012_David_Gershon.ashx) data and analytics, will launch its new real-time cash and derivatives market data platform DGX on 12/12/12.

*   50,000 stocks, indices and ETFs
*   4,000 CDS curves

*   All metals, 250 agriculture products and wet and dry freight
*   All interest rates (all yield curves including OIS, implied correlations, basis spreads, inflation, BMA)

One take away item from DGX – [another](http://www.waterstechnology.com/inside-market-data/news/2213348/superderivatives-readies-beta-dgx-realtime-otc-derivatives-terminal) app store:

> DGX includes an app store that will enable third-party software vendors to create applications to deliver content sets not available in the basic terminal offering—for example, specialized news, economic analysis or corporate actions data—to which DGX clients will be able to instantly subscribe via chargeable apps that can be integrated as widgets into the platform

Hopefully the UI isn’t the same as [this](http://www.waterstechnology.com/inside-market-data/news/2213348/superderivatives-readies-beta-dgx-realtime-otc-derivatives-terminal) beta screen-shot.
