    ratio of Rydex bear to bull assets and the bottom panel shows the ratio of flow
    to bearish Rydex and money market assets to bullish assets.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: From this chart, I can make a number of observations. First of all, the long-term
    trend of Rydex investors are generally correct. They were bullish and poured money
    into bull funds during the Tech Bubble. When the market turned, they were sellers
    until the market bottomed in 2003, when they turned into marginal buyers. When
    the market bottomed in 2009, Rydex investors correctly turned bullish and poured
    money into bull funds. Strictly from a bear/bull asset ratio viewpoint, I would
    therefore not be overly bothered by the all-time lows of bear/bull assets shown
    on the middle panel chart.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, I can make a case that traders can find useful signals when the bear/bull
    asset ratio (middle panel) reaches a near-term extreme and the bear/bull flow
    ratio (bottom panel) reaches an extreme as well. I have marked with dotted vertical
    lines when conditions indicating excessive bullishness have occurred since the
    2007 market peak. The red lines indicate episodes when the market has either stalled
    or retreated, while the blue lines indicate when the market has continued to rally.
    Despite the low number of signals, this indicator has been more right than wrong
    in the past.

    price on a portfolio whose underlying holdings are often thinly traded. ETFs allow
    market-makers to hedge inventory risks when liquidity in the underlying bond and
    related derivatives markets is insufficient and ETFs are also commonly used for
    rebalancing flows by investors with passive or index-linked strategies. The liquidity
    of ETF bond funds, however, builds on the willingness and capacity of authorised
    participants – typically the same dealers that provide immediacy services in bond
    markets – to make markets for ETF shares.

    via their impact on the risk-taking capacity of key market-makers. At the current
    juncture, with mutual funds and ETFs having attracted significant inflows from
    both institutional and retail investors, a reversal in global bond markets could
    trigger redemptions that, as funds sell assets to meet cash demands, could amplify
    the decline in bond valuations. Notably, bond mutual funds have managed significant
    outflows in the past (eg during previous episodes of monetary policy tightening)
    that have generally not disrupted financial markets. Yet, past episodes of large
    redemptions occurred at times when fund holdings were much smaller, both in absolute
    terms and relative to trading volumes and dealer inventories. ***Current market-making
    trends, however, suggest that redemptions could have a larger impact on bond market
    liquidity than in the past.***

    players would have debt issues which would just facilitate industry consolidation.
    But with the state of the credit market excluding sovereigns, we could have something
    else entirely. The energy sector makes up a large segment of the HY bond market
    and it’s about to take a big hit.. Sooner or later it’s coming. If the high-yield
    market in it’s fragile state is given a push we could see a real rout in the markets.
    It’s starting to look like energy debt could go bidless for a time and take HY
    with it if action isn’t taken soon. And that action, in part should be for the
    orgy of debt issuance that is being used for buy-backs to stop asap.

    When Brent and WTI were trading at $110 and $90 respectively, as they were for
    much of the last three years, sovereign wealth funds were rapidly growing assets.
    Indeed, we find a strong empirical relationship between the price of oil and sovereign
    wealth fund AUM (see figure). WTI above $100 has corresponded to AUM growth of
    +10%, while WTI at current levels suggests a more modest 5% growth rate.

    at current levels, the more likely it is that these investors stop seeing inflows,

    expansion from the BoJ and ECB.
