> 来源：[http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2012/12/an-updated-look-at-intermediate-term.html#0001-01-01](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2012/12/an-updated-look-at-intermediate-term.html#0001-01-01)

## Purpose

In this blog I will be examining market action and quantifying my findings. Using sentiment, breadth, price and volume indicators - both standard and customized - I will try and uncover short-term edges which could be taken advantage of by market participants. I will frequently add opinion to these studies and may sometimes post opinions without quantifiable research behind them.
