    a friend about trend following funds and a lot of the recent blogs and debates
    proclaiming the death of trend following.

- en: Using the Barclay CTA Index as a proxy, we can certainly see that there was
    a huge level shift of performance from around the 1990s and onwards, making the
    annual return appear to be on an almost exponential decay. However from about
    1990 to present, the annual returns have have been steadily oscillating in a range
    band from around -1% to 13% (with some outliers), and although the return per
    decade has been dropping over the last few decades, there's not really enough
    data to make any strong judgements about it's demise. Just looking at the oscillatory
    behavior and considering the bearishness towards this class of funds-- It might
    just suggest a good reversion based long bet on trend-followers.
