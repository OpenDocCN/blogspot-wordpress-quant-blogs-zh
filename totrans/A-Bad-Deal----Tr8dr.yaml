- en: For someone not in the financial business this may seem to be a good deal (seeing
    the 55% and capital preservation). I think it is a relatively poor deal though.
    The continuously compounded effective annual rate is only ~8% and that is only
    achieved if the market does indeed appreciate 55%.

- en: The cost of the options is paid for out of the returns or in the worst case
    through the adjusted strike price. That said, increasingly, the options are going
    to be deeper and deeper out of the money if FXI continues to be a good investment
    (meaning cheaper hedging costs).
