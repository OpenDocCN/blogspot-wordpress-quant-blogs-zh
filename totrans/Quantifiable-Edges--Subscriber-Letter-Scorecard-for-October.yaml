    Catapult trades, which combined comprise the CBI. They also performed well during
    the January and March selloffs, but suffered an unusually difficult period during
    the June/July selloff.

- en: I don’t suggest position sizes. The primary reason for this is I’m not acting
    as a financial advisor. I don’t feel it is appropriate to suggest allocation sizes
    without understanding someone’s financial situation and risk tolerance. Even for
    my own trading I run different portfolios with different levels of aggressiveness.
    For instance, my most aggressive portfolio is my IRA. Here I may use options to
    sometimes get 400-500% leveraged. Other portfolios on the other hand normally
    take much more conservative stances and some rarely reach or exceed 100% exposure.

    report, but rather a trade idea scorecard. Therefore, no matter how objective
    I try to be the reporting of the results is always going to be skewed depending
    on how you approach the trades. For instance, I always recommend scaling into
    the Catapult positions in 3 parts, whereas the “System” trades (whatever system
    I unveil other than Catapult) are normally one entry. The “QE Index” trades I
    normally recommend scaling into as well. For my own trading I trade much larger
    size with the index trades than any of the individuals. I also control my exposure
    by limiting the total amount invested per day. As I mentioned, this will vary
    depending on the account I’m trading. My most aggressive account I may put in
    up to 100%/day and get heavily leveraged using options. A more conservative account
    may max out at 15%-20% per day.

    so personal results would vary greatly depending on the trader’s approach. Still,
    there was more than ample opportunity to take advantage of the Quantifiable Edges
    trade ideas in October. With all those caveats in mind, recent results are listed
    below and broken down by category. Since October was so unusual, I’ve also shown
    the September results below.
