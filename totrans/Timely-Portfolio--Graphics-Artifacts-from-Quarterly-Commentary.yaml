- en: For my Q2 2012 commentary, I tried multiple graphs to illustrate the disconnect
    of the US stock markets with the rest of the world.  I think I finally settled
    on this simple Excel bar graph populated by Bloomberg data, but I thought some
    might like to see some of the R graphical artifacts as I explored how best to
    illustrate my point.

    history, but without all the noise of a daily, weekly, or even monthly chart. 
    I tried a chart connecting the 200 day max/min points, but it still seemed noisy
    and difficult to follow. One big letdown was Yahoo! Finance not providing DJUBS,
    E1DOW, or P1DOW any more.

    and I probably liked this best of the R charts.  This shows enough of the path
    to see the universal move up to 2010, and then the disconnect.

    for the fork.

    and end since December 2008.  This certainly shows the huge disconnect between
    the U.S. and the rest of the world, but I found it difficult to describe the methodology
    within the chart.
