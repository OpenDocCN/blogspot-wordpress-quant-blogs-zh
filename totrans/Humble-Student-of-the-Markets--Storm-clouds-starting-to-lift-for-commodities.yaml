    and recovery. Dr. Copper, which is an indicator of world cyclical demand, is at
    or near new highs. The Baltic Dry Index, a shipping cost benchmark, fell from
    all-time highs in 3Q 2007 and has stabilized (see the chart [here](http://investmenttools.com/futures/bdi_baltic_dry_index.htm),
    click on the *BDI & Copper* link to see the two together).
