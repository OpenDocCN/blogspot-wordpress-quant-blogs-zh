- en: I’ve been heads down working on [SpreadServe](http://www.spreadserve.com/) recently,
    so haven’t paid so much attention to the [etrading](https://etrading.wordpress.com/2006/08/31/adverse-selection-and-uninformed-traders/)
    [topics](https://etrading.wordpress.com/2006/08/31/adverse-selection-and-uninformed-traders/)
    that I used to [blog](https://etrading.wordpress.com/2007/05/24/rfs-vs-rfq/) about
    so much. Thanks to an update from [mdavey](https://mdavey.wordpress.com/), I’ve
    been catching up on the excellent, [thought provoking content](http://www.directmatchx.com/blog/)
    that [jgreco has been posting](https://medium.com/@jgreco/internalization-and-adverse-selection-79f9fee8684d)
    on his plans for a [new US Treasury trading venue](http://directmatchx.com), organised
    as a limit order book, with buy and sell side trading on an equal footing. I enjoyed
    the post on [internalization and adverse selection](https://medium.com/@jgreco/internalization-and-adverse-selection-79f9fee8684d). His
    points about [single dealer platforms](http://www.directmatchx.com/blog/single-dealer-platforms-and-adverse-selection)
    are well founded too, though my own experience in rates trading is that it’s difficult
    to get client flow on to SDPs as by their very nature they can’t offer multi dealer
    RFQs, which are critical for real money clients that must prove best execution
    for regulatory reasons. Of course, if the inter dealer prices from BrokerTec,
    eSpeed and EuroMTS were public in the same way as equity prices from major exchanges
    are public, then more solutions to the best execution problem would be possible.
    As jgreco rightly points out, transparency is key.

    ? That must be a tier 2 or 3 bank. All my experience has been at tier 1 orgs where
    all pricing and RFQ handling is automated. If a trader quotes a price by voice,
    it’s a price made by the bank’s own pricing engines. Those engines will be coded
    in C++, driven by Eurex futures or UST on the runs, and showing ticking prices
    on the trader desktop. Mind you, obfuscation techniques were used to frustrate
    step 2: copy and paste quote. After you’ve spent a fortune building a rates etrading
    infrastructure, you don’t want everyone backing out your curve from your Bloomberg
    pages.'

  zh: '[那真的是工作流程吗](http://www.directmatchx.com/blog/welcome-to-interest-rates-trading)？那一定是二三线银行。我所有的经验都是在一线机构，所有定价和询价处理都是自动化的。如果交易员通过语音报价，那就是银行自己定价引擎的价格。这些引擎将以C++编写，由Eurex期货或UST
    on the runs驱动，并在交易员桌面上显示滚动价格。请注意，使用了混淆技术来阻止第二步：复制并粘贴报价。在花费了一大笔钱建立了利率电子交易基础设施之后，你不希望每个人都从你的彭博页面上撤出你的曲线。'

- en: How do you shift liquidity? When liquidity is concentrated at a single venue,
    it’s difficult to move. The only case I know of is German Govt Futures moving
    from Liffe to Eurex. I guess UST liquidity is fragmented across D2D and D2C venues,
    so it’s not concentrated all in one place, improving DirectMatch’s chances of
    capturing some of the flow.

  zh: 你们如何转移流动性？当流动性集中在一个交易场所时，移动起来很困难。我知道的唯一案例是德国政府期货从Liffe转移到Eurex。我猜美国国债流动性分散在D2D和D2C场所，所以不是集中在一个地方，这提高了DirectMatch捕捉部分流量的机会。
