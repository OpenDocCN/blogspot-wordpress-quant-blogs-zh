- en: I’ve been heads down working on [SpreadServe](http://www.spreadserve.com/) recently,
    so haven’t paid so much attention to the [etrading](https://etrading.wordpress.com/2006/08/31/adverse-selection-and-uninformed-traders/)
    [topics](https://etrading.wordpress.com/2006/08/31/adverse-selection-and-uninformed-traders/)
    that I used to [blog](https://etrading.wordpress.com/2007/05/24/rfs-vs-rfq/) about
    so much. Thanks to an update from [mdavey](https://mdavey.wordpress.com/), I’ve
    been catching up on the excellent, [thought provoking content](http://www.directmatchx.com/blog/)
    that [jgreco has been posting](https://medium.com/@jgreco/internalization-and-adverse-selection-79f9fee8684d)
    on his plans for a [new US Treasury trading venue](http://directmatchx.com), organised
    as a limit order book, with buy and sell side trading on an equal footing. I enjoyed
    the post on [internalization and adverse selection](https://medium.com/@jgreco/internalization-and-adverse-selection-79f9fee8684d). His
    points about [single dealer platforms](http://www.directmatchx.com/blog/single-dealer-platforms-and-adverse-selection)
    are well founded too, though my own experience in rates trading is that it’s difficult
    to get client flow on to SDPs as by their very nature they can’t offer multi dealer
    RFQs, which are critical for real money clients that must prove best execution
    for regulatory reasons. Of course, if the inter dealer prices from BrokerTec,
    eSpeed and EuroMTS were public in the same way as equity prices from major exchanges
    are public, then more solutions to the best execution problem would be possible.
    As jgreco rightly points out, transparency is key.

    and market microstructure…

    by [LMAX’s](http://www.lmax.com) Java exchange implementation, their custom collections
    and [Disruptor](https://lmax-exchange.github.io/disruptor/). I would have expected
    C++, but then I’m an old school C++er.'

    ? That must be a tier 2 or 3 bank. All my experience has been at tier 1 orgs where
    all pricing and RFQ handling is automated. If a trader quotes a price by voice,
    it’s a price made by the bank’s own pricing engines. Those engines will be coded
    in C++, driven by Eurex futures or UST on the runs, and showing ticking prices
    on the trader desktop. Mind you, obfuscation techniques were used to frustrate
    step 2: copy and paste quote. After you’ve spent a fortune building a rates etrading
    infrastructure, you don’t want everyone backing out your curve from your Bloomberg
    pages.'

- en: How do you shift liquidity? When liquidity is concentrated at a single venue,
    it’s difficult to move. The only case I know of is German Govt Futures moving
    from Liffe to Eurex. I guess UST liquidity is fragmented across D2D and D2C venues,
    so it’s not concentrated all in one place, improving DirectMatch’s chances of
    capturing some of the flow.
