    rightly criticized for creating dangerous systemic risks will do what is natural
    to protect their turf. No, not by looking deeply at their practices and asking
    if they actually do create greater risk, but by hiring a slew of lobbyists and
    image consultants to change the debate and stop any potential regulation in its
    tracks. As

    which I've been doing for 15 years. Scientists get touchy if you criticize their
    work, but generally respond with reasons and try to convince you you're wrong.
    Financial firms respond with threats of lawsuits. I found this out last year when

- en: for Wired UK on high-frequency trading and its potential systemic perils. I
    sent an early draft to the then PR person for GETCO, one big HFT firm, asking
    for her comments and help so I didn't misrepresent anything. I often find that
    showing interested parties early drafts of articles gets them to voice their criticisms
    early, so I can take them into account in later drafts. In this case it didn't
    work, as the PR person didn't respond with any reasoned argument.. Instead, she
    went quite ballistic. Even though I hadn't criticized GETCO at all in the piece
    -- I merely mentioned them as HFT traders, and argued that HFT trading in general
    may present new kinds of systemic risks -- she threatened to get the lawyers involved
    if I mentioned GETCO in the article at all.

    lobbyists to prevent any new legislation which might hurt their profits, to hell
    with the stability of markets as a whole.

    in a legal way, and what they do brings some clear benefits to markets -- it has
    lowered spreads over the past decade and has indeed made it possible for many
    smaller traders to compete with the larger banks. But the HFT traders ought to
    be honest about that fact that no one -- absolutely no one -- currently knows
    what kinds of new systemic risks enter a market when it becomes dominated by algorithms
    making thousands of trades a second. This is new territory, and human intuition
    just isn't up working out what is likely to happen. Paul Wilmott made this point
    quite eloquently in

    strike any day and possibly bring deep damage to the larger economy. Personally,
    it would seem sensible to put in place a speed limit of one trade per second and
    be done with it. Do we really need to trade faster than that?'
