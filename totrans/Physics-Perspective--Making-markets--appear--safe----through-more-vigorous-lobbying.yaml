    rightly criticized for creating dangerous systemic risks will do what is natural
    to protect their turf. No, not by looking deeply at their practices and asking

    image consultants to change the debate and stop any potential regulation in its

    sent an early draft to the then PR person for GETCO, one big HFT firm, asking
    for her comments and help so I didn't misrepresent anything. I often find that
    showing interested parties early drafts of articles gets them to voice their criticisms
    early, so I can take them into account in later drafts. In this case it didn't
    work, as the PR person didn't respond with any reasoned argument.. Instead, she
    went quite ballistic. Even though I hadn't criticized GETCO at all in the piece
    -- I merely mentioned them as HFT traders, and argued that HFT trading in general
    may present new kinds of systemic risks -- she threatened to get the lawyers involved
    if I mentioned GETCO in the article at all.

  zh: 我为《Wired UK》写了关于高频交易及其潜在系统性风险的文章。我给GETCO这家大型高频交易公司的时任公关人员发了一份早期草稿，请她发表意见和帮助，以防我误解了什么。我经常发现，给感兴趣的各方看文章的早期草稿，可以让他们尽早提出批评，这样我就可以在后续草稿中考虑他们的意见。但这次没起作用，因为那位公关人员没有提出任何有理由的论点..相反，她反应非常激烈。尽管我在文章中根本没有批评GETCO——我只是提到他们作为高频交易者，并论证高频交易可能会带来新的系统性风险——但她威胁说如果我在文章中提到GETCO，就会请律师介入。

    in a legal way, and what they do brings some clear benefits to markets -- it has
    lowered spreads over the past decade and has indeed made it possible for many
    smaller traders to compete with the larger banks. But the HFT traders ought to
    be honest about that fact that no one -- absolutely no one -- currently knows
    what kinds of new systemic risks enter a market when it becomes dominated by algorithms
    making thousands of trades a second. This is new territory, and human intuition
    just isn't up working out what is likely to happen. Paul Wilmott made this point
    quite eloquently in
