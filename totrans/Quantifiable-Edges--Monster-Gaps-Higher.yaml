- en: As of now the market is gapping up very strongly on bailout news. SPY is up
    over 4% as I type. I looked back to find other instances of monster gaps and how
    the market behaved on those days. For this study I required the gap to be at least

    do their own interpretations. I would note that all 4 instances took place in
    September or October of 2008.
