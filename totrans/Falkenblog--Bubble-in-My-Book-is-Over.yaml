- en: I fixed typos and simple mistakes (eg, Against the Odds, vs. Against the Gods),
    about a dozen or so of them; I'm sure a couple remain. The Kindle version is now
    in process of incorporating these changes, but the old version will still be available
    while it's being fixed.  There won't be any marks that show it is the 'typo corrected'
    edition.
