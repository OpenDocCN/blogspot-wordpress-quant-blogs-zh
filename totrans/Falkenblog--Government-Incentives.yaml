    because they operate maximizing total social welfare, not just that of the shareholders.
    Thus, the community, employees, even global warming, are simultaneously considered
    in their calculus. This is clearly better than merely maximizing shareholder profits.

    from, say, 1930 to 1970\. Einstein, like many other smart, but economically ignorant
    writers, noted that "production for use" is obviously better than "production
    for profit", and legions of college students think that getting rid of profits
    would simply lower costs, and create a better focus on serving people rather than
    profits. The problem as Hayek pointed out, is that only a price rationing system
    in a free economy incents the right people, at the right time, to make the right
    decisions. It decentralizes decision making. The alternative is a political clusterfluck,
    as interests wrestle for turf over a perceived fixed economic pie. Hayek mentions
    Einstein specifically in his

    up. Is regulation disinterested? Maxine Waters can be counted on for making all
    sorts of paranoid accusations, as she represents her inner city Los Angeles district
    in a way that would make Huey Long proud. But she and her husband have ties to

    payments from a separate holding at the bank, also worth between $250,000 and
    $500,000". Now, that's a return on capital!

    assets in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stock, obvious a bad investment, but also,
    suggests a fundamental lack of true banking, making loans, as opposed to merely
    investing in the stock market, which is a poor use of bank capital. it's privately
    held, so who knows what the solvency of this bank truly is, but if they had a
    lot of Fannie stock, they are in big trouble.

    minority lending in 2007, Ms. Waters criticized regulators for not doing enough
    to help minority banks stave off mergers with non-minority institutions. A provision
    designed to aid OneUnited was written into the federal bailout legislation by
    Mr. Frank, who is chairman of the financial-services panel. Meanwhile, it was
    disclosed that OneUnited pays for a Porsche used by one of its executives and
    its chairman's $6.4 million beachfront home in Pacific Palisades, Calif., a luxury
    enclave between Malibu and Santa Monica.
