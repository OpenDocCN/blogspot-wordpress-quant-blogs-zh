- en: 'I was sufficiently pleased by the response to my [strategy-in-a-box ETFs](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Strategy-in-a-Box%20ETFs)
    post that it seems appropriate to launch a follow-up post to address several questions
    raised or implied by readers. The biggest issues seemed to revolve around the
    history, performance and holdings of these ETFs. It is also important to understand
    the nature of the index and/or strategy that the ETF seeks to replicate, as well
    as the timing and methodology used to rebalance the ETFs. For each of the six
    aforementioned strategy-in-a-box ETFs, I have therefore also included links to
    a profile/summary page; the prospectus; a current list of holdings; the Morningstar
    performance data; and the StockCharts gallery chart:'

    I would not consider this to be a long time, but given that it covers both strong
    bull and bear markets, I believe it is an appropriate time period from which to
    draw some conclusions. Perhaps more interesting is the rebalance period, where
    quarterly rebalancing seems to be the norm. I have spent a fair amount of time
    playing with various rebalancing methods and at least in my experience, I find
    it difficult to gain a meaningful edge with quarterly rebalancing.

    it is just a matter of time before I roll out screw top, synthetic cork and real
    cork strategies. Perhaps then we can turn our attention to the next dimension,
    Jeroboam, Methuselah and Nebuchadnezzar strategies…
