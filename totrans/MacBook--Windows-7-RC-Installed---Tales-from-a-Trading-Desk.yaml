- en: After a weekend away I came home and installed Windows 7 [RC](http://blogs.msdn.com/mthree/archive/2009/05/05/windows-7-rc-050509.aspx)
    on my MacBook. Installation was quick with no issues, the only thing I still don’t
    understand why Microsoft hasn’t included with Windows 7 is any virtual drive software
    – hence forcing me to yet again install [Virtual CloneDrive](http://www.slysoft.com/en/virtual-clonedrive.html)
    before I can get all the applications I need installed. On the plus side, its
    nice to see that Windows Explorer is now behaving properly.
