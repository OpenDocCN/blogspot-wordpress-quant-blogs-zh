    readers asked me if I thought the markets could continue to make new highs while
    the VIX hovered significantly above its all-time low. [My answer then](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/04/spx-and-vix-revisited.html),
    an enthusiastic “Absolutely!” has not wavered. In the interim, I have even managed
    to accumulate two additional months of data to support my case.'

    single digits to the floor in the 12-12.50 zone that has prevailed since March
    is, in my opinion, a major positive for the sustainability of this bull market.****The
    fact that premium sellers are demanding more for assuming risk is a direct refutation
    of the "complacency" argument those looking to call a top are so fond of trotting
    out. And to the extent there is less premium selling activity, the "speed bumps"
    that are created at strikes with large open interest that can often slow rallies
    to a crawl are mitigated.”**'

    time-frame, the more likely the SPX and VIX are to be negatively correlated. In
    the short-term, therefore, bulls should be adding to their positions when the
    VIX spikes; over the longer term, however, I would not be surprised to see both
    the SPX and the VIX to be moving higher in tandem.**
