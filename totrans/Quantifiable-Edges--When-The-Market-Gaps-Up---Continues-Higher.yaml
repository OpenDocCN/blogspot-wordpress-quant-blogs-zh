    tendency to pull back over the next several days.

- en: While the “% Wins” isn’t much worse than a coin toss on average, the poor W/L
    Ratio creates a negative expectancy. The bearish implications peak at 4 days across
    the sample. Not seen in the above table is that about 70% of all instances closed
    below their trigger price at some point in the following 3 days. This number increases
    to 89% when looking out 6 days.
