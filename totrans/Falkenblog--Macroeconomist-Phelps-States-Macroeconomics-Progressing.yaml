    about macro (his main contribution was to note the Phillips curve was wrong, there
    is a ''natural level'' of unemployment and no long run trade off between unemployment
    and inflation). Phelps states that macro has been very productive over the last
    generation.'

    in the economy? As the size of the government in the US have grown pretty constistently
    over the past 100 years, with episodic upswings and downswings during major wars,
    suggests policy makers and voters think it has always been too small. For all
    the shrill excorations about market fundamentalism, and the emphasis on markets,
    markets have been a shrinking part of the economy. So, what is 'the fact' that
    needs explanation, the rise of the intellectual basis for markets, or the rise
    in the attractiveness of government? It seems famous, credentialed economists
    disagree (eg, Friedman, North, vs. Stiglitz, Krugman).

    over 1 suggest government spending is good, less than 1 means counterproductive
    (assuming that government and private consumption and investment have the same
    value, ie, the cost is the value created). Robert J. Barro--a well respected economist--

- en: 'that the multiplier is around 2.0 (1.5 in the short run). Monetary policy currently
    targets a nominal GDP via the Taylor rule, an ad hoc policy that is indifferent
    to how much of GDP is inflation or real growth, so it reflects nothing that macro
    theorists have figured out, but rather, a reasonable rule of thumb. There is no
    consensus on why poor countries are poor (Easterly: too much top-down control;
    Stiglitz: too much markets, too little government spending).'

  zh: 乘数大约为2.0（短期内为1.5）。货币政策目前通过泰勒规则着手于名义国内生产总值，这是一种临时性政策，对于GDP中有多少是通货膨胀还是实际增长并不关心，因此它并不反映宏观理论家们所想的事情，相反，它是一个合理的经验法则。对于贫穷国家为何贫穷并没有共识（伊斯特利：过多的自上而下控制；斯蒂格利茨：市场过多，政府支出过少）。
- en: I think the only thing macroeconomists have learned, is that Soviet style socialism
    does not generate higher growth than non-Soviet style socialism, and this fact
    wasn't predicted by any economic consensus, but rather, the obvious failure of
    the Soviet Union, and the comparison of countries like East and West Germany,
    or North and South Korea.
