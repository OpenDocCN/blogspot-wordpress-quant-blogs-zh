    about macro (his main contribution was to note the Phillips curve was wrong, there
    is a ''natural level'' of unemployment and no long run trade off between unemployment
    and inflation). Phelps states that macro has been very productive over the last
    generation.'

    in the economy? As the size of the government in the US have grown pretty constistently
    over the past 100 years, with episodic upswings and downswings during major wars,
    suggests policy makers and voters think it has always been too small. For all
    the shrill excorations about market fundamentalism, and the emphasis on markets,
    markets have been a shrinking part of the economy. So, what is 'the fact' that
    needs explanation, the rise of the intellectual basis for markets, or the rise
    in the attractiveness of government? It seems famous, credentialed economists
    disagree (eg, Friedman, North, vs. Stiglitz, Krugman).

    to add rigor showing that some things could be true. That's hardly helpful, in
    that theories that explain everything explain nothing, and bad ideas are a dime
    a dozen (ie, developing an enthusiasm for the Phillips curve, and proving it wrong,
    is hardly progress).

    over 1 suggest government spending is good, less than 1 means counterproductive
    (assuming that government and private consumption and investment have the same
    value, ie, the cost is the value created). Robert J. Barro--a well respected economist--

    targets a nominal GDP via the Taylor rule, an ad hoc policy that is indifferent
    to how much of GDP is inflation or real growth, so it reflects nothing that macro
    theorists have figured out, but rather, a reasonable rule of thumb. There is no
    consensus on why poor countries are poor (Easterly: too much top-down control;
    Stiglitz: too much markets, too little government spending).'

    does not generate higher growth than non-Soviet style socialism, and this fact
    wasn't predicted by any economic consensus, but rather, the obvious failure of
    the Soviet Union, and the comparison of countries like East and West Germany,
    or North and South Korea.
