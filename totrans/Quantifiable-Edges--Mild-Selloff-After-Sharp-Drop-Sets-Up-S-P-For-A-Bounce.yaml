    weak bounce as the S&P finished marginally lower. So tonight I looked at S&P performance
    following a sharp drop and then a marginally lower day. Below I show the 5-day
    return across a spectrum of possible % declines between 0 and X%.

- en: Rather than the bearish results found when the market undergoes a weak bounce,
    we see here that limited additional selling carries a bullish expectation over
    the following week. The edge remains fairly consistent regardless the level of
    decline between 0% and 1%.
