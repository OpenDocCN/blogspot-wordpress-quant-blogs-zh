    with *VIX and More* in other locations, with blog content soon to ramp up again
    to almost daily postings starting next week.

    recently ran a three-part series on the *VIX and More* [Stock of the Week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/stock%20of%20the%20week)
    ‘Sequential Portfolio,’ which is part of my weekly [subscriber newsletter](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/subscriber%20newsletter).
    I posted about the MarketSci review of the SOTW in [MarketSci on the Stock of
    the Week ‘Sequential Portfolio](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/04/marketsci-on-stock-of-week-sequential.html),’
    but did not mention two follow-up articles about the SOTW that completed the MarketSci
    series. The full series is as follows:'

    had a very solid week, recovering from a down day on Monday to post a 10.7% gain
    for the week. This brings the cumulative performance of the SOTW to +1145% since
    the March 30, 2008 inception.

    Subscriber Newsletter Blog](http://vixandmoresubscriber.blogspot.com/)* to summarize
    enhancements made to the subscriber newsletter during the first quarter and to
    discuss the results of three model portfolios I maintain, in addition to the SOTW.
    The news is all positive and is detailed in [Newsletter and Portfolio Performance
    Update for 3/31/10](http://vixandmoresubscriber.blogspot.com/2010/04/newsletter-and-portfolio-performance.html).

    EVALS is short for ETF Volatility Analysis Long/Short and reflects an approach
    to trading ETFs that relies primarily on volatility-based signals. For more information,
    try [EVALS Q1 2010 Update](http://vixandmoreevals.blogspot.com/2010/04/evals-q1-2010-update.html).

    Monthly: The Option Traders Journal*](http://www.expiringmonthly.com/). This electronic
    magazine has generated a fair amount of buzz and very positive feedback. I have
    attached a graphic of the Table of Contents for the April issue below. For the
    April edition, I contributed an article on selling vertical spreads as well as
    an ongoing graphical look at the options world we call Charting the Market. More
    information is available at [http://www.expiringmonthly.com/](http://www.expiringmonthly.com/).'

    not-so-abundant ‘free’ time I am also rewriting portions of *Trading with the
    VIX: How to Use Fear, Volatility and Sentiment to Enhance Trading*. The folks
    at Wiley have been very patient with this process, but the time has come to step
    up my efforts to complete the manuscript. I will do my best to keep the new content
    flowing at *VIX and More*, hopefully on an almost daily basis, but the book deserves
    – and will receive – the bulk of my prose attention going forward.'
