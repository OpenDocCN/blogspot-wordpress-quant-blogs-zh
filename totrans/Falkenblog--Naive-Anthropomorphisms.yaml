    They have not only intentions, but often faces. Further, they are either good
    or bad. Only later do we learn that most of the world is not so much malicious
    as indifferent. Hopefully, we learn that many most facets of society, such as
    income distribution, or the creation of cities, of technologies, is an emergent
    phenomenon, created but not designed by individuals, and singular individuals
    mainly help us apply a narrative.

    " brought the economy to its knees", and now are "determined to stop any kind
    of watchdog" (the SEC, Fed, FDIC, OCC, and state insurance regulators don't seem
    to count). They are "bonus babies who were so short-sighted that they put the
    economy at risk and contributed to the destruction of their own companies". She
    shows not mere mistrust, but contempt for the the financial market she plans on
    controlling. As William F. Buckley put it, I would rather have Citibank be run
    by the first 100 names in the Boston phone directory than a bunch of Harvard professors.

- en: I've worked with a CEO of a large financial organization. He was a nice guy,
    but he had very little to do with the pricing, product design, or other tactical
    strategic issues in the bank. He managed 'the process', personalities, did public
    relations, and perhaps championed a handful of corporate actions such as acquisitions.
    To personify the banking industry's actions as the will of their individual leaders,
    is like saying that America does what Obama wants it to do. They have more of
    a say than anyone, but it's still a small say.

    less nuanced than other banks, more power to him, but if that tactic started losing
    money, it would be abandoned, and if it made money it would be copied. That's
    how the market works, profits tell banks what to do, losses what not to do. To
    the extent they are making short term profits, say by lending to windfarms due
    to a stimulus package windfall, investors are the only ones with real incentives
    to evaluate and punish firms for this behavior. After all, in Washington, they

- en: That someone with such a understanding of complex financial institutions highlights
    her naiveté, as if things are what they are, not because they are an equilibrium
    of borrower and saver preferences, but rather, the whims of The Captains of Industry
    in their top hats. To give her power, would merely reinforce what everyone in
    the industry knows, that Washington regulators are out-of-touch. For her, competition
    is simply a "race to the bottom to develop new ways to trick customers", and so
    we should expect her to create a 'stable' industry, like in our education and
    postal industries, where there is limited competition but lots of guarantees,
    and little or no productivity growth. She knows what banking customers want, and
    so doesn't trust a market to provide quality services and products because evil
    CEOs hypnotize their customers into thinking they want things they really don't.
    A better definition of a do-gooder cannot be found. I think she might be successful
    in her primary objective, in that socialists countries were immune from financial
    crises. I just think she doesn't realize this cripples GDP growth, as highlighted
    by the Cold War 'experiment'. After all, you can keep a pet from getting sick
    by killing it, if that's your sole objective.

- en: Bad things aren't the result of evil intentions, so much as smart people overconfident
    in their ability to make the world a better place. They see people who disagree
    with their means as disagreeing with their ends, totally dismissing the possibility
    that they could be making things worse. She thinks her new fiefdom, the CFPA ,
    will "consolidate seven separate bureaucracies, cut down on paperwork, and promote
    understandable consumer products. In the process, it will stabilize the industry,
    rebuild confidence in the securitization market, and leave more money in the pockets
    of families". ORLY? When has a new bureaucracy reduced bureaucracy? When has it
    'cut down on paperwork'? The pages of fine print and endless places to initial
    are because of our laws and regulations, not in spite them. Will the bureaucracy
    make people wealthier? Well, government's the main place of employment growth,
    so I guess things are looking up.

  zh: 不好的事情不是恶意的结果，而是聪明人过于自信他们能让世界变得更美好。他们认为不同意他们的手段的人就是不赞成他们的目标，完全忽视他们可能会让事情变得更糟的可能性。她认为她的新领地，CFPA，将“整合七个独立的官僚机构，减少繁文缛节，推广易懂的消费者产品。在这个过程中，它将稳定行业，重建证券化市场的信心，并让家庭有更多的钱”。真的吗？新的官僚主义何时减少了官僚主义？它何时“减少繁文缛节”？因为我们的法律和法规，页面上的小字和无尽的地方辛勤劳动不应被忽视。官僚主义会让人们更富有吗？嗯，政府是就业增长的主要地方，所以我想事情正在好转。
