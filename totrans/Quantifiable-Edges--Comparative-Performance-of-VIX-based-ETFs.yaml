- en: where I discussed VIX-based ETFs. I examined the performance of several of the
    ETFs. I also presented ideas on how they could be traded as an alternative to
    a standard index trade, and under what conditions doing so might be appropriate.
    Below is a chart from the presentation. It shows the performance returns of the
    SPX, VIX, and a few of the more popular VIX-based ETFs. I have updated the chart
    through 4/14/11\. It goes back to 11/30/10, which was the first day that XIV was
    available to trade.

    to do a horrible job of that. Instead it has almost exactly matched SPX performance.
    I can't imagine ever wanting to trade something that matches SPX performance,
    but carries greater risk. XXV is useless.

    TVIX will likely suffer long-term as well. If you are buying for a short-term
    trade, then TVIX looks like a decent high-powered alternative to VXX.
