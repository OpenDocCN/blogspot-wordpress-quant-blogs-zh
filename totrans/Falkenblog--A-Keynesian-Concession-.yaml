    public works projects, employees, and especially productivity. The multiplier
    supposedly works independent of actually producing anything tangible, which is
    why I can't take this theory seriously. Now even Krugman admits there has been
    nothing created, which just means we should spend even more money, highlighting
    that the Keynesians will argue for more continually (like the series of ineffectual
    Japanese fiscal stimulus packages in the 1990's).

  zh: 有了这样的投资，我并不惊讶我们没有看到公共工程项目、员工，特别是生产力的大幅增长。据说这个乘数独立于实际产出，这就是为什么我不能认真对待这个理论的原因。现在甚至克鲁格曼也承认没有任何东西被创造出来，这只意味着我们应该花更多的钱，凸显了凯恩斯主义者将会持续争辩要进行更多支出（就像上世纪
    90 年代无效的一系列日本财政刺激计划一样）。
