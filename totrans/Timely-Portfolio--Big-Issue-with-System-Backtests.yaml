- en: Almost always, when I see a system backtested, the backtest assumes a static
    portfolio with no contributions or withdrawals.  This assumption only covers an
    extremely limited subset of my clients.  Cash flows in and out of a portfolio
    or system can have a much larger impact on ending net worth than the geometrically
    linked performance of a system or money manager.  Most of the systems I have shown
    for demonstration purposes on this blog have suffered from this unrealistic assumption. 
    I thought I should show how contributions similar to those in a 401k can affect
    a simple moving average system.

    that potential abandonment of the system due to lack of confidence is highly likely. 
    As shown below, there was very little discussion of moving average strategies
    1990-2000 due to the simple fact that buy/hold absolutely clobbered them.  While
    normal adjustments like return/risk and a log scale can soften the impact on the
    screen, the psychological impact to a client can be very damaging as the focus
    moves entirely to $ value of the portfolio.  Below is a comparison of buy and
    hold versus a 200 day moving average system with no additions or withdrawals. 
    As discussed, 1990-2000 was not kind to the moving average.

    $100,000 and adding $10,000 per year ($2,500 per quarter), the results differ
    significantly.

    Clients don’t think in log scale when evaluating performance.  They simply look
    at $ value of the portfolio.  If we look at the results without a log scale, underperformance
    by 2000 is visible, but it is nowhere near as great as shown in the first chart
    of the post, and outperformance after the 2008-2009 collapse is very healthy. 
    I actually think a client could accept this profile much more readily than that
    shown with a static portfolio.

    can be added, but we can start to see how inflows and outflows can impact a portfolio
    whether it is buy/hold, discretionary, or systematic.
