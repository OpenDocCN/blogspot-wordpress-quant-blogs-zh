## Agile – Why its become a dirty word

There has been a lot of [chatter](http://joostdevblog.blogspot.nl/2014/03/why-scrum-is-fundamentally-broken-but.html) recently on why [agile](http://pragdave.me/blog/2014/03/04/time-to-kill-agile/) is not the [word](http://scrum.jeffsutherland.com/2014/01/can-you-define-agility.html) it used to be.  I offer a few bullets on why agile has in some ways become an off-roading term for software development based on bad practices I’ve seen:

*   Scrum daily stand-up’s are really either status meetings or team meetings.  Nobody in the team appears to recall the three standard questions to be answered, or the time-box duration for the meeting
*   12 original XP [practices](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming) are often lost by agile teams.  How often have you seen an agile team start coding with no coding standards, no design, and no idea of the XP practices on testing
*   Using [tools](http://pragdave.me/blog/2014/03/04/time-to-kill-agile/) that restrict agility rather than enhance agility
*   The perception that with a backlog, there is no need for [requirements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILHci40-W_0) or non-functional requirements (NFRs) – this alone in my view is why backlogs seem to be the last item an agile team cares about, yet they are the core to the efficiency of an agile team
*   Although most have agile/scrum/xp/etc on their resumes/CV’s, few appear to know the standard ceremonies of Scrum, and the reason for the ceremonies – backlog grooming is one that appears to be missing from many teams
*   No wall 😦
