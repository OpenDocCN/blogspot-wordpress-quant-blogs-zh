- en: One of the most important components of a good system is to have a low drawdown
    relative to its average return. Most traders make a concerted effort to pursue
    strategies with low drawdowns. In fact, people are so focused on drawdowns, that
    it is often detrimental. To me one of the most important things when considering
    drawdowns is WHEN they occured. Drawdowns that typically start after periods of
    strong profitability are far more desirable than equivalent drawdowns that start
    during flat or even poor periods. Few traders consider this, and that is why few
    people pursue trend-following because of the high perceived drawdowns. What is
    not mentioned is that most of the time these drawdowns occur AFTER high profitability.
    In contrast, short term strategies can “spontaneously combust” especially if they
    are poorly conceived. Even worse is that fact that commissions and bid-ask spreads
    can crush these strategies to bits right from the start. You will be down 50%
    with no chance for recovery from the get-go even though the strategy curve had
    low drawdowns in retrospect.

  zh: 一个良好系统最重要的组成部分之一是，相对于平均收益，其回撤较低。大多数交易者都会努力追求低回撤的策略。事实上，人们过于关注回撤，这往往是有害的。对我来说，在考虑回撤时最重要的事情之一是它们发生的时间。通常在强劲盈利期之后开始的回撤，比在平坦甚至亏损期开始的等效回撤更受欢迎。很少有交易者考虑这一点，这就是为什么很少有人追求趋势跟踪策略，因为人们普遍认为其回撤较高。未被提及的是，这些回撤大多数发生在高盈利之后。相比之下，短期策略可能会“自发燃烧”，尤其是如果它们构思不当的话。更糟糕的是，事实是佣金和买卖价差从一开始就可以将这些策略摧毁。即使策略曲线回顾起来回撤较低，你也会一开始就损失50%，且没有恢复的机会。
- en: The often irrational desire for ultra-low or no drawdowns is the main reason
    why the Madoff scandals of the world occur in the first place. No one seems to
    be able to resist a straight line equity curve even at the expense of lower returns.
    **The straighter the equity curve the less questions people ask about how the
    returns were generated.** Many strategies secretly contain non-linear payoffs
    such as risk arbitrage or selling options, or ponzi schemes. Another silent but
    deadly killer in this area are “overfitted” strategies with more than 3 rules
    and les than 20 trades. The reality of statistical significance is that there
    will ALWAYS be rule combinations that peformed phenomenally well with 100% successful
    trades. The chances of them repeating their performance in real life depends on
    how and when you did your testing. These strategies appear wonderful until they
    blow up and never recover.

  zh: 对极低或无回撤的非理性渴望是导致世界范围内麦道夫丑闻发生的主要原因。没有人能够抵挡住即使收益较低也要一条直线股票曲线的诱惑。**股票曲线越直，人们对收益是如何产生的疑问就越少。**许多策略秘密地包含非线性收益，如风险套利或出售期权，或是庞氏骗局。在这一领域，另一个潜在的致命杀手是“过度拟合”的策略，这些策略超过3条规则并且交易少于20次。统计学上显著性的现实是，总会有一些规则组合在100%成功的交易中表现出色。它们在现实生活中重复表现的概率取决于你的测试方式和时间。这些策略在爆炸并无法恢复之前看起来非常棒。
- en: The bottom line is, even if you see a perfect equity curve, always ask yourself
    why a strategy should continue to perform the same way in the future. Also ask
    yourself whether certain conditions would cause your strategy to have non-linear
    payoffs. Solid human judgement in this area is absolutely unavoidable.

  zh: 总之，即使你看到一个完美的股票曲线，也要始终问自己，为什么一个策略在未来会以同样的方式表现。也要问自己，某些条件是否会导致你的策略产生非线性收益。在这方面，坚定的人性判断是绝对不可避免的。
