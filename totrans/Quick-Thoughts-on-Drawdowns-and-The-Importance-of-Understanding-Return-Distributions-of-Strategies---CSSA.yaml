- en: One of the most important components of a good system is to have a low drawdown
    relative to its average return. Most traders make a concerted effort to pursue
    strategies with low drawdowns. In fact, people are so focused on drawdowns, that
    it is often detrimental. To me one of the most important things when considering
    drawdowns is WHEN they occured. Drawdowns that typically start after periods of
    strong profitability are far more desirable than equivalent drawdowns that start
    during flat or even poor periods. Few traders consider this, and that is why few
    people pursue trend-following because of the high perceived drawdowns. What is
    not mentioned is that most of the time these drawdowns occur AFTER high profitability.
    In contrast, short term strategies can “spontaneously combust” especially if they
    are poorly conceived. Even worse is that fact that commissions and bid-ask spreads
    can crush these strategies to bits right from the start. You will be down 50%
    with no chance for recovery from the get-go even though the strategy curve had
    low drawdowns in retrospect.

    why the Madoff scandals of the world occur in the first place. No one seems to
    be able to resist a straight line equity curve even at the expense of lower returns.
    **The straighter the equity curve the less questions people ask about how the
    returns were generated.** Many strategies secretly contain non-linear payoffs
    such as risk arbitrage or selling options, or ponzi schemes. Another silent but
    deadly killer in this area are “overfitted” strategies with more than 3 rules
    and les than 20 trades. The reality of statistical significance is that there
    will ALWAYS be rule combinations that peformed phenomenally well with 100% successful
    trades. The chances of them repeating their performance in real life depends on
    how and when you did your testing. These strategies appear wonderful until they
    blow up and never recover.

- en: The bottom line is, even if you see a perfect equity curve, always ask yourself
    why a strategy should continue to perform the same way in the future. Also ask
    yourself whether certain conditions would cause your strategy to have non-linear
    payoffs. Solid human judgement in this area is absolutely unavoidable.
