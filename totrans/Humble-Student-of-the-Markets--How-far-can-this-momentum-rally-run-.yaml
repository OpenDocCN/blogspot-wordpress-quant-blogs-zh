    and buy what has gone up without properly assessing whether that is likely to
    continue. Momentum is created by this blind buying, and pulls prices further and
    further away from where they should be, until they snap back and crush those chasing
    gains.

    economic strength and slowly came to believe in higher profits. Perhaps company
    analysts still haven’t included U.S. corporate tax cuts in their profit forecasts
    due to their complexity, which could mean still more good news to come as the
    earnings season brings tax guidance from CFOs.
