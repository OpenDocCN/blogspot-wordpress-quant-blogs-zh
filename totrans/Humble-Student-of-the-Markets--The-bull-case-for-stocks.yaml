    the US banking system during the LDC (Less Developed Country) loan crisis of the
    early 1980's. After the banks lent to all manner of LDCs that went bust, the authorities
    pretended that the loans that were on the banks' books remained good for 100 cents
    on the dollar. At the same time, the Fed began to lower rates in August 1982 and
    signaled to the banks that they would continue to stay low or continue to fall.
    Thus, the banks could borrow short and lend long, which repaired their balance
    sheets over time.

    The Bank currently accepts collateral rated as low as A-, although debtors must
    pay a penalty based on asset risk. Were even riskier assets allowed to be used
    as collateral or if the penalty were dropped, this would provide significant incentive
    for banks to purchase sovereign debt, particularly given currently high yields
    on bonds. If it worked, it would be the ultimate carry trade—borrowing from the
    ECB is now a cheap 1%, so banks could see huge returns on sovereign debts with
    high yields.
