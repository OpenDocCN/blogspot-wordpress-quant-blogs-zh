    has vowed to make some tailored changes to its established macroeconomic policy.
    At an earlier State Council meeting, a consensus was reached that China will accelerate
    the approval of some infrastructure projects, promote consumption of energy-saving
    home appliances and increase tax cuts on enterprises in a bid to ensure steady
    growth. China's central bank also announced a 50-basis-point cut for banks' reserve
    requirements on May 12, the second such cut this year and a third since December,
    which will release more liquidity. ***The stimulus packages are expected to reach
    1 trillion yuan ($158 billion).***

    dollar assets, it is possible because of China’s substantial short-term dollar
    liabilities. Essentially, we’re talking about a dollar-denominated duration mismatch
