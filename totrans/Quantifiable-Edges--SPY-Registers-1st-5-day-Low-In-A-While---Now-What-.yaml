- en: Thursday the SPY managed to close at a 5-day low after 16 days without doing
    so.  This triggered the study below, which I last showed on the blog May 25th.

- en: Results here suggest a moderate upside edge.  As I have said before, persistent
    uptrends normally wither before they die. They rarely just turn on a dime.  It
    appears unlikely that SPY will be faced with a lot more selling before it manages
    to bounce.
