    moving averages (40 or 50-day) is now at an extreme level. I’ve done some testing
    in the past and found such indicators to be of limited value. Worden Bros. has
    several indicators that show the % of stocks trading relative to the 40-day moving
    average. In addition to the simple % above/below, they also show how many are
    at least 1 and 2 standard deviations above and below the 40ma. I believe these
    indicators are more telling. I’ve found this information to be especially useful
    in looking at extreme selloffs and have compared the % 1-standard deviation below
    the 40-ma indicator (T2114) to my

    sharp and powerful short-covering rallies to emerge from such extreme conditions.
    In developing the Catapult method and CBI indicator I was unable to find an overbought
    equivalent. Of course the market is dealing with different emotions near tops
    than it is near bottoms. Fear, which is prevalent near bottoms, is much more powerful
    than greed, which is prevalent near tops.

    what might the Worden 1-standard deviation measure suggest when it gets extremely
    high? As of Friday it was certainly extremely high. Over 80% of stocks closed
    at least 1 standard deviation above their 40-day moving average. Worden Bros.
    maintains data back to 1986 and this is the 1st time the indicator has cracked
    the 80% level. I looked at other overbought levels to study the 1-month returns
    following some less-extreme readings.

    times the indicator has reached extreme levels. On the low end the results are
    about the same as the long-term market drift. While not shown, periods leading
    up to 20-days are also all generally positive. As the indicator moves higher the
    results look even more bullish. But instances are incredibly low, so not much
    can be extrapolated. I see two points to take away from this exercise: 1) When
    the market gets extremely overbought that is not necessarily a bad thing, and
    on its’ own is certainly not a signal to sell short. 2) By this measure the market
    is now more overbought than it has been in at least 23 years.'

    to rise at anywhere near its recent pace. On the other hand, those expecting a
    sharp, sustained selloff from here had better be basing their expectation on evidence
    other than just overbought breadth.
