- en: The statistical arbitrage hedge fund strategy, or “stat arb”, is a case in point.
    Classic stat arb can be simplified as buying oversold stocks and shorting overbought
    stocks, along with some risk control layered on top of the stock selection process.

- en: The economic rationale behind this type of strategy is that the stat arb practitioner
    is being paid to provide liquidity to the market. In normal times, this approach
    can be quite profitable but it can backfire badly during periods of economic stress.
    If you use a short-term investment strategy of buying oversold stocks and shorting
    overbought stocks during a recession, you will ride the big losers (e.g. Adelphia,
    Enron, etc.) all the down to the bottom.

    model. It ranks US large cap stocks on a short-term overbought/oversold measure
    and buys the bottom 20% most oversold and shorts the top 20% most overbought stocks.
    I do not pretend for the moment that this is an actual stat arb strategy as it
    has no risk control. However, it does serve as a proxy for the performance for
    these types of strategies as I have discussed

    should be wary of too much exposure to stat arb strategies under these economic
    conditions.
