    I wanted to explore the efficient frontier including international indexes since
    1980.  Life is great when your primary indexes (Barclays Aggregate and S&P 500)
    lie on the frontier as they did 1980-1999.  The situation becomes much more difficult
    with a frontier like 2000-now.

    bad with annualized returns of all indexes stocks and bonds > 8% even including
    the last decade of “equity misery”.  As the S&P 500 shifted from the top of the
    efficient frontier to the bottom, it seems the focus over the last decade as been
    finding alternatives for the S&P 500\. Strangely, the unbelievable riskless return
    of bonds has allowed some investors to claim and use bonds as one of these potential
    alternatives to the S&P 500.

    correlations.

- en: However, bonds based on the yield to maturity of the Barclays Aggregate index
    suggest, even guarantee, forward returns of only 2.3%, significantly below the
    +8% generously provided for 30 years.  I believe the focus on alternatives should
    be alternatives for the guaranteed miserably low returns of bonds ([WSJ Bond Buyers
    Dilemma](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204449804577068152764286924.html)). 
    The trick though is reducing risk (drawdown) of these alternatives to an acceptable
    level to most bond investors.  Max drawdown on bonds since 1982 has been 5%, which
    is virtually an impossible constraint for any risky alternatives, since in even
    very attractive secular buy-hold periods, drawdown generally is 20% to 30%.

    unless we can discover a method to reduce drawdown on the risky set of alternatives
    to 20%, but really down to 10%.  How do we transform risky alternatives with historical
    drawdowns of 40%-70% to an acceptable bond alternative?  I think it requires tactical
    techniques blended with cash with a lot of client education and hand-holding.
