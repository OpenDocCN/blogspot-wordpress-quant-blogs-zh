    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    I have been monitoring the evolution of SPY implied volatility (IV), and this
    chart represents the final snapshot before the election. Since I began keeping
    track in September, IV has spiked at the time of the election and remained elevated
    into 2021, indicating a high level of anxiety over the results, and the possibility
    of a contested outcome. It was only recently that contested election anxiety has
    faded, and IV began to normalize just after the initial spike.

    represented by SPY. Gold (GLD) and long bond (TLT) IV both surges at election
    time, and slowly fall afterward.

    the actual outcomes are difficult to predict, investors can engage in some scenario
    planning so that they can be prepared.
