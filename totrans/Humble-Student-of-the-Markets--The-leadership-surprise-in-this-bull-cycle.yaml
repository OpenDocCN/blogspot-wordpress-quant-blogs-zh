    leadership such as Energy and Materials. As a reminder of how difficult it is
    for former leaders to recover, the poster child of inflation-hedge vehicles, gold,
    peaked out at $850 in early 1980 and went into a long bear phase that did not
    bottom out until 2001.

    Staples and the enthusiasm spread into Consumer Discretionary companies. The shares
    of these companies was driven by the LBO-boom, fueled by junk bond offerings.

    over the previous bull cycle. Look for new leadership." As an illustration of
    this principle, consider this 15-year chart of the relative performance of Technology
    stocks relative to the SPX. The sector peaked out with the NASDAQ in early 2000,
    tanked and has been in a sideways relative consolidation phase for over a decade.
    While the relative uptrend (shown by the blue arrowed trend line) shows some promise,
    this sector is unlikely to be the next market leaders for some time. Telecom stocks
    (not shown) also display a similar pattern of rise, fall and sideways relative
    consolidation.

    Here is the relative performance chart of the Energy sector. While Energy did
    not crash as the Financials did in the aftermath of the Lehman Crisis, this sector
    is either making a broad relative top by rolling over or, more charitably characterized
    as undergoing a sideways relative consolidation. No leadership here.

    these stocks are 1) relative outperformance in the past couple of episodes appear
    to be cyclical and not secular in nature; and 2) these stocks are starting to
    falter as they recently breached a relative uptrend. If we accept the premise
    that Consumer Discretionary stocks constituted this cycle`s secular leadership,
    then the conclusion is this bull market is over.

    a bad combination for a deal maker, but it is the third reason that influences
    my thinking most: the economy, despite its being in year six of an economic recovery,
    still looks in many ways like quite a young economy. There are massive reserves
    of labor in the official unemployment plus room for perhaps a 2% increase in labor
    participation rates as discouraged workers potentially get drawn into the workforce
    by steady growth in the economy. There is also lots of room for a pick-up in capital
    spending that has been uniquely low in this recovery, and I use the word “uniquely”
    in its old-fashioned sense, for such a slow recovery in capital spending has never,
    ever occurred before. The very disappointment in the rate of recovery thus becomes
    a virtue for deal making.'

    which in complete contrast to today were old economic cycles already showing their
    wrinkles. Worse than being in full swing, they were usually way over capacity.
    Thus, 2000 was helped along by the bubble in growth stocks to over 60 times earnings,
    allowing companies like Cisco, possibly correctly, to believe they were dealing
    with a near-zero cost of capital in making deal after deal for their massively
    overpriced stock.
