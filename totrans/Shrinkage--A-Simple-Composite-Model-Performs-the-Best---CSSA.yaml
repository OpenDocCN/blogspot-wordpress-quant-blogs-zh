    "Adaptive Shrinkage") approach, and also introduced the [average correlation shrinkage
    model](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2013/10/27/average-correlation-shrinkage-acs/
    "Average Correlation Shrinkage (ACS)"). The real question is; what shrinkage method
    across a wide variety of different models works best? In backtesting across multiple
    universes from stocks to asset classes and even futures, Michael Kapler of [Systematic
    Investor](systematicinvestor.wordpress.com) calculated a composite score for each
    shrinkage model based upon the following criteria: Portfolio Turnover, Sharpe
    Ratio, Volatility, and Diversification using the [Composite Diversification Indicator](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2012/09/21/minimum-correlation-algorithm-paper-release/
    "Minimum Correlation Algorithm Paper Release") (CDI). Lower turnover was preferred,
    for sharpe ratio obviously higher was better, for volatility lower was better
    and for promoting diversification higher was considered better. The backtests
    and code can be found [here](http://www.systematicportfolio.com/adaptive-shrinkage).

    with a minimum of excel skills: it is the simple average of the sample correlation
    matrix, the anchored correlation matrix (all history), and the [average correlation
    shrinkage](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2013/10/27/average-correlation-shrinkage-acs/
    "Average Correlation Shrinkage (ACS)") model. This produced the best blend of
    characteristics that would be desirable for money managers. The logic is simple:
    the anchored correlation matrix provides a long-term memory of inter-asset relationships,
    the sample provides a short-term/current memory, and the average correlation shrinkage
    assumes that the average correlation of an asset to all other assets provides
    a more stable short-term/current estimate than the sample. This is a good example
    of how simple implementations can trump sophisticated as long as the concepts
    are sound. As a generality, this is my preferred approach whenever possible because
    it is easier to implement in real life, easier to de-bug, and easier to understand
    and explain. Another interesting result from the rankings is that the ensemble
    approaches to shrinkage models performed better. Again this makes more sense.
    The adaptive shrinkage model (best sharpe) performed poorly by comparision–especially
    when considering turnover as a factor. It is possible that using only a 252-day
    window, or using only sharpe as an objective criterion were suboptimal. Readers
    are encouraged to experiment with other approaches. (*we did investigate some
    methods that showed a lot of promise*)'

    of which approach was used. The results are better but not worlds apart from using
    just the sample correlation. There is a practical limit to what can be achieved
    using a lower variance estimate of the correlation matrix with shrinkage. More
    accurate predictors for correlations are required to achieve greater gains in
    performance.
