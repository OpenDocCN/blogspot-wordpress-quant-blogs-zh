- en: '**Mid-week market update:** The big macro events of this week hasn''t really
    moved the needle on risk appetite. The market didn''t react much to the Quarterly
    Refunding Announcement detailing the schedule of Treasury issuance. The JOLTS
    report showed slightly weaker than expected job openings, but quits and layoffs
    declined as well, indicating a general deceleration in the labour market.'
