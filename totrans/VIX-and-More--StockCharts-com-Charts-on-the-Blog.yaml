    from which quite a few screen shots have been imported into the blog.

- en: Recently I have fielded a few questions about my StockCharts charts and I wanted
    to spend a little time talking about the information contained in these charts.
    For starters, StockCharts offers what they call a “[gallery view](http://stockcharts.com/charts/GalleryView/)”
    for each ticker. This is a group of three free charts consisting of a daily chart
    with five months of data, a weekly chart with two years of data and a point and
    figure chart. StockCharts members also have a fourth intraday utilizes ten minute
    bars for the past four days.

    of StockCharts is in creating custom charts. At the bottom of this post is what
    I would call my “standard chart” from StockCharts, which uses daily bars over
    the course of the past eleven months. My standard chart utilizes candlesticks
    because I prefer the informational content that can be displayed in one candle.
    I also utilized three simple moving averages: 10 days (solid blue line) for the
    short-term; 50 days (dotted red line) for the intermediate-term; and [200 days](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/200%20day%20SMA)
    (dotted green line) for the longer-term. These are widely-used moving averages
    and the selection is somewhat arbitrary. I prefer the 10 day to the more common
    20 day because I often have a very short-term time horizon and because the 10
    day is utilized heavily by traders who follow the VIX.'

    set to 20 days and two standard deviations. I like to use Bollinger Bands to give
    a sense of the ebb and flow of [historical volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/historical%20volatility)
    superimposed on the price data, rather than as a separate study above or below
    the main price chart. I choose to display these by area instead of the more typical
    lines because I want to limit the lines cluttering up the chart and give some
    semblance of visual clarity. According to extensive studies done by John Bollinger,
    one would expect 88-89% of all future daily price moves to fall within the range
    defined by the current Bollinger Bands – assuming, of course, the future resembles
    the past.

    a 50 day exponential moving average line in purple, making it relatively easy
    to identify large volume spikes.

- en: 'Finally, a reader recently asked why the y-axis is not proportional. The short
    answer is that charts can be plotted with a standard (proportional) y-axis or
    using a logarithmic axis. The benefit of a standard axis is the ease of measuring
    absolute changes: ten points up and ten points down are the same height. For longer
    periods, however, compounding distorts percentage changes, so a logarithmic axis
    ensures that percentage moves up and down are the same height. Consider a $100
    stock. If it goes up 50% three years in a row, it ends up at 337.50 (100*1.5*1.5*1.5)
    a change of 227.50 points. But if the same stock goes down 50% three years in
    a row, it will be at 12.50, a change of only 87.50 points. On a standard y-axis,
    the move up 50% for three years will look 2.6 times (237.50 / 87.50) greater than
    the move down 50% for three years. A logarithmic axis makes sure that these percentage
    changes look identical to the eye. In a future post, I will talk more about logarithmic
    axes and use some examples to illustrate their advantages and disadvantages.'
