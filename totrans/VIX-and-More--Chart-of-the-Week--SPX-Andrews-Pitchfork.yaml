    ricocheting around in their heads over the weekend, investors had quite a few
    extreme scenarios in mind for equities today, but for the most part, hovering
    around the unchanged line was not considered a likely outcome. Yet, 1 ½ hours
    into today’s session, stocks are essentially flat.

    chart for the last two decades, the moves in stocks over the last 2 ½ years or
    so look remarkably unremarkable, with stocks hugging the middle prong of the pitchfork,
    which currently points at a trend line “fair value” for the SPX of about 1265.

    degree of moderation and [mean reversion](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/mean%20reversion)
    in recent stock moves. The other reason I have attempted to shoehorn Andrews Pitchforks
    into the discussion is that the last two times I posted about these charts, I
    have received very strong reader feedback that suggests those who are seeing these
    charts for the first time are attracted to the visual simplicity and underlying
    logic of these charts. Going forward, this Andrews Pitchfork chart will provide
    some real value if it can help to define a channel and mean reversion target for
    stocks. With all the macroeconomic uncertainty out there, it would be nice if
    something in the technical toolbox can provide investors with some meaningful
    context that incorporates elements of both volatility and direction.
