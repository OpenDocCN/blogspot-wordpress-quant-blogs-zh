- en: For those of us plying our trade as coders in the City of London, or Wall Street,
    there’s a choice to be made about our mode of employment. Each of the three options
    has its own particular pros and cons. And if you’re to avoid a mismatch between
    your employer’s expectations, spoken and unspoken, and your own, it’s best to
    be clear sighted about those pros and cons. I’ve worked as permie and consultant.
    I’ve never been a contractor. But I do have a very strong preference for permanent
    employment. Here’s my take on the up and down sides…

    the last downturn lots of consulting firms canned staff pretty quick when the
    work dried up

    to maximise billing. The client wants the project done, and the consultants gone.

    and permie work. I fear that in many cases it combines permie compensation with
