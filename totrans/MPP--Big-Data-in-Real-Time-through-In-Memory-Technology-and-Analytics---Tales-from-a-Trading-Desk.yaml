    train reading lead to the following thoughts: Page 93 of the PDF talks to finance,
    and modelling environments (I assume risk?).  With the push for more systems to
    become Near Real-Time (NRT), in-memory is clearly the chosen path.  With in-memory,
    the question come as to what product/Open Source solution will assist on this
    path.  [GridGain](http://www.gridgain.com/blog/fyi/gridgain-4-2-released/) is
    one such technology with offerings in this area.  [RBS](http://www.bankingtech.com/bankingtech/article.do?articleid=20000192301),
    as blogged about previously, has gone down the Oracle Coherence route in the Big
    Data trade world – Operational Data Cache.'

    the product evolution has created three [products](http://www.gridgain.com/features/)
    – Compute Grid, Data Grid and Big Data (effectively a combination of the two other
    products).   Its also clear the [death](http://gigaom.com/cloud/why-the-days-are-numbered-for-hadoop-as-we-know-it/)
    of [Hadoop](http://www.gridgain.com/blog/fyi/gigaom-hadoop-days-are-numbered-are-they/)
    is over sold in Big Data land.

- en: Once you’ve stored data in memory across multiple nodes, it’s important to achieve
    locality of data and processing. If you process an incoming event on one node,
    and need to read and update data on other nodes, your processing latency and scalability
    will be very limited. Achieving locality requires a solid routing mechanism, that
    will allow you to send your events to the node most relevant to them, i.e. the
    one that contains the data that is needed for their processing

    offers the ability to run in-memory analytics on Big Data.  Interesting to see
    “Credit and risk management” mentioned, but with little detail.  Anyone used Kognitio?'
