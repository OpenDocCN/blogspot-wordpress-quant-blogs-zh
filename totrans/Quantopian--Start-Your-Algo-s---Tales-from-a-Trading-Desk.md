## Quantopian: Start Your Algo’s

As blogged about previous, [Quantopian](http://www.forbes.com/sites/tomiogeron/2013/01/23/quantopian-brings-algorithmic-trading-to-masses/) is now in beta – but currently only for US stocks.  [Python](https://www.quantopian.com/help) appears to be the language of choice – similar to a few of the tier-1 banks initiatives in the last few years.  I don’t see any latency data on the [site](https://www.quantopian.com/help) 😦
