    me of when people criticize politicians for 'arrogance' and 'not listening to
    the people'. Now, we tell children that politicians are 'leaders' who 'implement
    the will of the people', when in reality they are naive dupes who genuinely believe
    what the masses believe or cynical hypocrites who are willing to make any sacrifice
    of conviction and self-respect in order to hold their jobs. So, the criticism
    works, but only for someone who believes the kiddie version of the job description.
    Similarly, some people think economists are those who understand the economy,
    who study the economy, and indeed, many are. But for the best, the most prominent,
    this is their avocation.

    economics major about economics or the market. Prominent economic theorists are
    'modelers', they make little models, akin to Bohr's atom or Newton's inverse square
    law, that are meant to explain and predict (of course not nearly as successfully),
    using mathematics. Economists are perhaps better understood as 'those who model
    economic phenomena', as opposed to 'those who understand economic phenomena'.

    creating models useful for teaching economics to grad students, and publishing
    by other economists. The model that made them famous, by the time they are famous,
    is usually forgotten. For example, Lucas'

    In the 1970''s when he wrote it it seemed apt as inflation uncertainty and recessions
    were prominent, but it doesn''t really work empirically, and it is mainly discussed
    now because it is a darn neat model, with an intuitive little functional form
    derived from intuitive--if implausible--assumptions: you push up this parameter
    (assumption), you get this nice implication.'

    menus), led to large business cycles. Again, plausible at first, now, not. Great
    economists are given a pass if their models fail empirically, because they are
    primarily judged as modelers, not describers of reality. A neat model has its
    own virtue.

- en: One could go on and on. An economics or financial theorist, if prominent, is
    not really someone who really understands the economy, but rather, someone who
    takes some current stylized facts and creates a model that seems capable of explaining
    these facts. By the time they get tenure or their Nobel prize, everyone understands
    either the model merely begs the question (eg, what causes productivity growth
    in Solow's model? What causes increasing returns to scale in Krugman's model?),
    or it is empirically useless (input-output models, dynamic programming). The pedagogical
    value of a model can not be underestimated, because for a professor, if you can
    use a model to generate a lot of g-loaded logic puzzles that appear relevant to
    economics, it is surely much better than being forced to read a bunch of essays
    on how and why tax cuts work. Good models have unambiguous correct answers that
    are easy to grade and work through; real life doesn't.

    that. It's depressing at one level, but we have enough people trying to explain
    and predict the big picture, taking into account the political-historical-sociocultural-global
    warming context. That is, the world is a vast, interconnected place with lots
    of important things going on, and reality has to take this into account. People
    who try to capture this big picture are called 'journalists', and while there
    are many good ones, this field does not seem to be advancing, any more than one
    could say legal theorists are using more discriminating logic than 100 years ago.
    So economists are not very successful, but neither are the alternative approaches.

    often makes it irrelevant, as there is little correlation between originality
    and the usefulness of an idea. That they fail in describing reality, is about
    as shocking as discovering a Chicago politician was engaging in
