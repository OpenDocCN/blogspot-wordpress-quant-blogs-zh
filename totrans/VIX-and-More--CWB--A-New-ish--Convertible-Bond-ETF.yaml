    but from time to time, these investments can make a good deal of sense.

- en: Launched four months ago (and still qualifying as “new” according to my warped
    ETF chronograph), the [SPDR Barclays Capital Convertible Bond ETF](https://www.spdrs.com/product/fund.seam?ticker=CWB)
    ([CWB](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/CWB)) is designed to track
    the price and yield performance of the Barclays Capital U.S. Convertible Bond
    >$500MM Index.

- en: Since the launch of CWB on April 16^(th), the bull market performance of this
    ETF has matched the SPX almost step for step, with lower volatility. In the chart
    below, CWB is represented by the red line, the SPX is in blue, and the iShares
    iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF ([LQD](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=lqd))
    is shown in green. This chart is an almost perfect illustration of why convertible
    bond ETFs (or closed-end fund or mutual fund) can be a powerful addition to one’s
    portfolio. At its best, in bull markets, convertibles have an upside comparable
    to stocks, with less downside risk. At their worst, which is generally in non-trending
    markets or bearish markets, the lower yield and expense of owning options that
    do not appreciate makes convertibles inferior to standard bonds.

    ETF and cherry pick their favorite options plays, but for those who wish to forego
    a customized approach and stick with an off-the-shelf product, CWB is – for the
    moment at least – the only ETF which is up to the task.
