    is positive albeit more muted. Bank lending rates remain at or near record lows.
    House prices remain strongly positive. Tax withholding retreated after an excellent
    November. Gallup consumer spending remained quite positive, despite challenging
    YoY comparisons, Johnson Redbook was moderately positive, but the ICSC index less
    so.

    of this year, and all looks well for the next 3 to 6 months. Housing and especially
    interest rates must be watched carefully, however, as to the end of 2014 and 2015.

    that occurs, has to be watched very carefully. Will long rates start to back up
    and push up mortgage rates and dampen growth in the cyclically sensitive housing
    sector?

    indicators still look punk. The ECB has made it clear that it is prepared to give

    cycle are usually the worst with the last two usually the best. Bear markets usually
    occur during the first two years. Since 2013 (the first year of this term) was
    so strong, historical odds for 2014 (the second year) to suffer a downside correction
    are pretty high.

    vertical bars show the last six bottoms occurring in 1990, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006,
    and 2010\. Earlier four-year patterns (not shown here) occurred in 1970, 1974,
    1982, and 1987 (the cycle skipped 1978 while 1987 was a year late). Most of those
    bottoms took place during the second half of those years (mainly around October),
    and have coincided with midterm congressional elections. Assuming the four-year
    pattern repeats, the next bottom is due in 2014 and most likely during the fourth
    quarter. That carries both good and bad news. While the second year of a presidential
    term (like 2014) is usually the weakest, the third year (2015) is usually the
    strongest. ***The bad news is that 2014 is likely to experience a major stock
    correction. The good news is that correction should lead to a major buying buying
    opportunity later in the year.***
