# VIX and More: VIX March OTM Calls

Jim Kingsland of [The Kingsland Report](http://buttonwood1792.blogspot.com/index.html) claims he’s on vacation, but he continues to ponder the significance of the [large open interest March VIX calls](http://buttonwood1792.blogspot.com/2007/02/quick-friday-vacation-post.html) all the way up to the 20 strike.

From looking at the open interest patterns out through February 2009, I can only find one other area where it looks like a snake swallowed a cow: the open interest of 63,171 in April 11 puts.  My (highly inexpert) guess is that someone has taken a significant long position in April 11 puts and hedged some of this in March with long calls across the 15-20 strike range.  If this is the case, it is an interesting way to play the current volatility environment and suggests that a lot of money is going on the fat tails and betting against the type of orderly rise in volatility that would be associated with a mild correction in the SPX.
