    suppliers of labor suffered. Those very painful market adjustments contributed
    to the rise of Nazism and Hitler. They had to find scapegoats. It just so happened
    that Jews formed much of the business class. In more recent memory, Malaysian
    prime minister Mahathir railed against evil foreign currency speculators during

    to step in was because of the substantial employment effects if these companies
    were to be shuttered. It’s not just about the direct employment of GM and Chrysler.
    If these car companies went down, such an event would also affect all the car
    parts manufacturers and their employees. Car plants and parts plants are located
    in specific parts of the country. That’s not all. Car dealers, which are located
    in every city and town in the country, would also be forced to close and lay off
    staff.
