    above the 1200 level as weakness which began on Monday and accelerated yesterday
    has continued into the early stages of today.

    I offered up a chartists’ perspective on how far the current pullback might extend.
    Today I am updating a table which has captured what I consider to be all the significant
    pullbacks since stocks bottomed in March 2009.

- en: At only 1.9% peak to trough, the current pullback is not yet as significant
    as any of the previous dozen pullbacks. Using the table as a measuring stick,
    if the current selloff is able to muster enough bearish momentum to match the
    group mean, this would take the SPX all the way back to 1151.
