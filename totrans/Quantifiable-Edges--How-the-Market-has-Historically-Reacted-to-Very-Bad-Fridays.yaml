- en: blog I showed a compelling study that examined large drops on Fridays.  Both
    the Crash of ’29 and the Crash of ’87 happened on Monday.  The Crash of ’87 is
    still remembered by many traders that are active today.  There was a strong selloff
    on Friday and then all hell broke loose on Monday.  But since then strong Friday
    selloffs have commonly been followed by bounces on Mondays.  Perhaps this is due
    to the fact that fear of a crash causes what might otherwise be an ordinary selloff
    to become exaggerated and overdone on Fridays.  Or perhaps it is just that people
    don’t want to hold over the weekend.  Whatever the reason, the tendency to bounce
    has been very strong.  I’ve updated that 4/19/10 study below.
