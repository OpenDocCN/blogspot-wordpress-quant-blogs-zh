- en: A "Breadth Thrust" occurs when, during a 10-day period, the Breadth Thrust indicator
    rises from below 40% to above 61.5%. A "Thrust" indicates that the stock market
    has rapidly changed from an oversold condition to one of strength, but has not
    yet become overbought.

    1945\. ***The average gain following these fourteen Thrusts was 24.6% in an average
    time-frame of eleven months. Dr. Zweig also points out that most bull markets
    begin with a Breadth Thrust.***

    2009\. A ZBT is a powerful exhibition of buying momentum and RSI(5) has not unexpectedly
    flashed an overbought reading. Right after the signal, the market weakened and
    pulled back for two days and continued upwards, showing a series of "good" overbought
    readings as it advanced.

    the "bottom" last week, though the low last week did not exactly test the August
    panic lows.

- en: If history is any guide, the Zweig Breadth Thrust is signaling that stocks are
    about to embark on another upleg. While the market is very overbought and I have
    no idea of what might happen in the next few days given the volatility seen during
    Earnings Season, these conditions are highly suggestive that downside risk is
    extremely limited and stocks will be significantly higher by year-end.

  zh: 如果历史可以借鉴， Zweig Breadth Thrust 指标显示股票即将开始另一轮上涨。尽管市场目前非常超买，且在财报季期间看到的波动性让我对接下来几天可能发生的情况毫无头绪，但这些状况强烈暗示下跌风险极其有限，年底时股票价格将显著上涨。
