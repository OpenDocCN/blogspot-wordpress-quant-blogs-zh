    the Fed is saying and what people are experiencing when they fill up their gas
    tanks or read about rising food prices around the world. Over the last couple
    of weeks I''ve taken note of newspaper headlines. Here''s a sampling: In USA Today,
    "Prices starting to creep higher"; in the Wall Street Journal, "Cost inflation
    puts a wrench into the works" and "Inflation fears replace other market worries";
    in Fortune magazine, "How inflation is turning breakfast into a luxury item";
    and just last Friday in the Journal, "Bernanke denies that Fed is stoking inflation."
    Are the Fed and the public on different planets?'

    i.e. commodities, than in a rise in generalized price levels, as measured by CPI
    - which is watched closely by central bankers and the bond market. This dichotomy
    has the potential to create real distortions.

    deflation. Falling prices drives asset prices down. Worse, they drive down wages
    — while people’s debts remain fixed. That vise crushes the middle class (the poor
    don’t have debts; the rich have real asset wealth). But the Fed’s printing presses
    can prevent deflation (or at least severe deflation, if not necessarily Japan-style
    deflation-lite).

    is contained. That just means that inflationary pain is borne disproportionately
    by the suppliers of labor compared to the suppliers of capital.
