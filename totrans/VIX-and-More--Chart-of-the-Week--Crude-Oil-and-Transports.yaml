- en: With [crude oil](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/crude%20oil) prices
    hovering around $108/bbl. level, it is only natural to begin wondering just what
    kind of impact crude prices will have on stocks.

- en: Looking back at recent history, crude oil and stocks have been positively correlated,
    largely because an improving economy translates into increased demand for crude
    oil. At some point, of course, rising crude oil prices are going to translate
    into a drag on GDP and on equities. Consensus estimates for the impact of crude
    oil on GDP generally assign about a 0.25% drop in U.S. GDP for every $10 increase
    in crude oil.

    apparent at $110 or perhaps at higher levels remains to be seen.

- en: When oil prices begin to be a significant drag on stocks, it will likely show
    up first in the transportation sector. Looking at the [Dow Jones Transportation
    Average](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Transportation_Average) ([DJTA](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/DJTA))
    and (West Texas Intermediate) crude oil prices since the beginning of 2010 in
    this week’s [chart of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week),
    it is obvious that the positive correlation between crude oil prices and transports
    has continued all the way up to the present. While I expect this positive correlation
    to end shortly, as long as transports continue to move up in concert with rising
    crude oil prices, investors should feel comfortable with their long positions
    in equities.
