# Vertx ACL Event Bus Thoughts | Tales from a Trading Desk

## Vertx ACL Event Bus Thoughts

Was thinking about authorisation/authentication and Vertx recently.  [mod-auth-mgr](https://github.com/vert-x/mod-auth-mgr) looks interesting, but isn’t quite what I’m looking for – basically more of an [ACL](http://um.terracotta.org/developers/nirvana/concepts/security/acls.html) appropriate to addresses.  Curious if anyone has a solution?  [Securing the bridge](http://vertx.io/core_manual_java.html#securing-the-bridge) is worth a read, but again, not quite what I want.

On the topic of persistent messaging, Tim Fox’s [Q&A](http://parleys.com/play/5148922b0364bc17fc56c8c7/chapter33/about) from Devoxx 2012, touches on the direction Vertx will take.
