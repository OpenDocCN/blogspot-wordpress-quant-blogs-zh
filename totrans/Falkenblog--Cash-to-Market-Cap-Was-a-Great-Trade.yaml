    its benchmark, and is up only 70%, which makes me feel better because I didn't
    invest in this portfolio either. Why? Well, it's not my bag. It would have been
    a one-off thing, and I was trying a different systematic approach. In retrospect,
    perhaps these are exactly the times to chuck standard methods and applied something
    as tried and true as cash/market cap, as this is a classic value play, not some
    newfangled bottom-fishing filter. However, the next time this happens the apocalypse
    will seem nigh and I'm sure I won't do it then either.

    by the large credit spreads well above any conceivable long term default projection
    (eg, B credits for 1000 basis points). Yet these things have only happened a handful
    of times. So, one could say, buy everything when things look bad, noting how things
    rebounded from 1974, 1990, 2002, and 2008\. Yet, it's a small sample, so the sample
    estimate of the returns to this strategy may be well above the population mean
