    Whether its the “turtles,” Ed Seykota, Larry Hite, or Michael Covel, a key concept
    that is emphasized is “robustness.” If you are a hard-core mathematician type,
    you tend to scoff at the homely, grandfatherish advice being espoused by the trend-following
    crew. They spin simplistic tales of creating systems that work across markets,
    and finding strategies that work over long periods of time. They preach about
    fat tails, and the unknowable future. The fact is that these guys are really on
    to something. The field of robust statistics emphasizes a lot of these principles,
    and truthfully PhD trained economists, physicists and finance geeks tend to ignore
    them at their own peril. The who’s who in the  history of hedge fund blow ups
    is littered endlessy with ivy league quant gurus. I dare you to show me a single
    hedge fund that blew up trading the 200-day moving average across asset classes.

    Deep down in the depths of human psychology we really crave certainty and consistency.
    Accepting that we can’t control the future is a battle we have to fight every
    day. Sadly the smarter you are the harder this is to accept. Tell me you haven’t
    fallen prey to the dreams of creating endless riches by optimizing your favorite
    indicator. I remember dark moments myself many moons ago trading e-minis dreaming
    of Freedom 35\. I would change my indicator settings daily, desperately trying
    to find the magic setting that would prevent me from getting whipsawed nearly
    every day.  When i started trying to design stock screens for the first time,
    i went crazy backtesting every possible combination. I was hoping to find the
    one combination of P/E ratios or EPS growth that would always win. If this was
    you, there is hope, and I would like to share with you my story. The first step
    in Optimizer’s Anonymous is recognizing that you have an optimizing problem!

    i learned on only kept 5 years of historical data and rolled forward every week.
    As I furiously tested away, I got to see how the screens that i built performed
    using a new start date. As time rolled on, i got to see how my screens performed
    in real life as well as their equity curves before and after.  It was an incredibly
    valuable experience that everyone should try for at least a few years. I started
    realizing though the course of testing that the more specific my parameters were,
    the noisier they performed out of sample. This problem was made even worse as
    i expanded the number of parameters. Selecting a price-earnings ratio of 7 or
    lower was unstable enough, but it was made worse by choosing stocks with an ROE
    higher than 15, and earnings growth greater than 20%. This led me on the path
    of using percentiles which i have already become notorious for on this blog—and
    with my professor friends. Another advantage was that i always tested across sectors
    simultaneously, under the assumtion that the underlying screen as a concept was
    more important than the idiosyncracies of a given industry. I tested like this
    for years even before receiving a formal education, and having that backround
    allowed me to design models that actually worked in real-life.'

    logical theories. A theory that is not generalizable is more likely to be valid
    that one that is highly specific. The greater the number of unique environments
    that a backtest can survive–the more likely it is to be robust. Building upon
    these observations are my prescriptions for Optimizer’s Anonymous:'
