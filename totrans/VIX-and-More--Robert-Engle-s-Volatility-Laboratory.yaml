- en: New York University’s [Stern School of Business](http://www.stern.nyu.edu/)
    has just launched a [Volatility Institute](http://w4.stern.nyu.edu/volatility/)
    that is run by [Robert Engle](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/%7Erengle/). Under the
    umbrella of the Volatility Institute is Robert Engle’s Volatility Laboratory,
    also known as [Vlab](http://vlab.stern.nyu.edu/) for short. Vlab is still in beta,
    but is definitely worth checking out and keeping an eye on to see how it evolves.

    [working papers](http://w4.stern.nyu.edu/volatility/papers.cfm?doc_id=100945)
    section and a listing of [events](http://w4.stern.nyu.edu/volatility/events.cfm?doc_id=100940).
