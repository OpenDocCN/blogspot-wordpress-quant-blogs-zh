    fund managers are. Michael Stokes of MarketSci kicked off the discussion with

    of the complaints fall into two categories. The main one goes something like this:
    “I’ve got a great system, why can’t Wall Street recognize me?” In both these cases,
    the writers identify themselves as “quants” and blame the bottom-up fundamental
    stock picking mindset as mental barriers to superior mutual fund performance.'

    systems or thinkers around, why can’t the average mutual fund outperform?

    that asset management is a business. More importantly, they fail to understand
    what mutual fund managers are selling.

    60% to stocks, 40% to bonds. Within the stock portfolio, allocate this much to
    large caps, that much to small caps. Maybe if you have a great growth manager,
    then offset it with a value manager, etc.

    If you bought a fund that was labeled as a mid-term government bond fund, what
    would your reaction be if you found it stuffed full of emerging market bonds?
    What is the mutual fund manager’s business risk if the emerging markets blew up?

    rationally. They are delivering what their customer wants. Straying from their
    mandate is the equivalent of offering sushi at a pizza joint. While bloggers such
    as Stokes, who work mainly on market timing models, have some very interesting
    ideas. Unfortunately for him, many of their ideas don’t fit in the mutual fund
    “boxes”.

    there to provide an investor exposure to an asset class. Unless you style yourself
    as a market timing fund or an absolute value fund, then not being fully invested
    all the time is style drift.

    portfolio of the top 100 stocks in the S&P 500, the forecast tracking error, according
    to most risk models, would easily be in the 3-5% range. (Note that tracking error
    is defined as the forecast one-standard deviation return difference between a
    portfolio and its benchmark).
