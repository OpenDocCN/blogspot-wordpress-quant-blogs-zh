- en: If you don’t already subscript to Mike Cohn’s weekly email tips, I suggest you
    take the 20 seconds to do so over [here](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/email-tips).
     This weeks tips is all about improving standup’s which I’ve blogged about before
    as often being poorly run.  My current preferred option is the distributed team
    standup with the team talking to the card in the “In-Progress” and “check” swim
    lanes.  If anyone speaks about something not on the board, its a big red flag.
     Further, the game clearly, is to move the cards to “Done”.

- en: the questions are reworded to focus on accomplishments rather than activity,
    it becomes clear that the team values progress. Some individuals generate a lot
    of activity, but no progress. They are like a swimmer flailing about in a pool–arms
    flying everywhere and legs kicking furiously but without any forward movement.
