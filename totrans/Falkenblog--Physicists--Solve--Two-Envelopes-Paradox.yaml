- en: Researchers from Australia have taken a step toward resolving a seemingly simple
    yet unsolved paradox known as the "two-envelope" problem. They’ve worked out a
    new strategy that can enable a player to beat the game in terms of increasing
    their payoff. The strategy could have applications in optimizing gains in investments
    and other areas...The researchers explained that the strategy emerges from recent
    advances in two-state switching phenomena that are emerging in the fields of physics,
    engineering, and economics.

    tell. I think the paradox comes from not looking at the true state space. It is
    funny to think these guys think they figured out how to get blood out of stone
    via 'emerging fields of physics, engineering and economics'. Asserting the solution
    they do is like asserting a mixed strategy is dominant for the

    of which contains twice as much money as the other. The player can open the envelope
    they choose, and then they have the option of switching envelopes. The other envelope,
    of course, has either twice the money or half the money as the first envelope,
    but the player does not know which

    which is 0.25 times more than the $X you have. But if they both apply such logic,
    how can that be rational, they both have the same expected, positive return in
    a zero-sum game (one's gain is the other's loss)?

- en: You might think you have $X in your envelope, and can trade to $2X or $0.5*X,
    giving you a gain of New Envelope minus value of Current Envelope, or 0.5*($2X+$0.5X)-$X,
    or +$0.25X. However, you must consider, symmetrically, you are the 'other guy',
    and so your envelope contains the $2X or the $0.5X. In that case, your expected
    gain is the opposite, trading gives you a new envelope with $X, giving up the
    random 0.5*($2X+$0.5X), generating an expected loss of $X-0.5*($2X+$0.5X), or
    -$0.25X. As you are either in the first or second case with equal probability,
    the expected value is zero, 0.5*(+$0.25X-$0.25*X).

    chance you could be the one who starts out with $2X or $0.5X. If one player has
    $X, you have a 50% chance of being that guy, a 25% chance of having 0.5*X and
    a 25% chance of having the 2X. When you look in your envelope, and see $10, you
    can't assume X=$10\. It could be that X=$20 or $5, conditional upon seeing $10
    in your envelope. Weighting everything probabilistically leads to no increase
    in value from exchange.
