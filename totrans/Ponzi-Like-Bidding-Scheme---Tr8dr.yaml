    which has received a bit of press in the US recently.   The attraction is that
    they offer products (such as ipads) for, say, an average price of $30-50 (whatever
    the highest bid is).    One may wonder how this works.'

- en: Most auctions are “penny auctions”, meaning that each bid placed on an item
    increments the price by $0.01\.   Prospective buyers pay for each bid they put
    forward on an item.   In fact, the company charges $0.60 / bid.   So with an end-auction
    price of, say, $50, the ipad has brought in $3000, because there were 5000 bids
    to achieve that price.  Wow, these guys are making a lot of money in terms of
    % markup!

    the last seconds.   Basically, it seems to me that the winner is the person in
    the pool of bidders that has not exhausted his prepaid bids or otherwise given
    up.

- en: Since one can see the bidder with the top bid in real-time as the end-game bidding
    occurs, perhaps one could game it, observing the timeseries of bids each participant
    has placed and come up with a view on likelihood of having reached their bidding
    limit.   At that point one would start testing by putting in a bid and determine
    who is left.

    have to get a gambling license.    Interesting “not-quite-a-scam” business concept.
      I have to think that eventually most participants, not having won anything will
    discontinue with the site.
