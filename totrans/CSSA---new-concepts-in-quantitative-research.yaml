    moving averages is the same only the math differs very slightly (see [Which Trend
    Is Your Friend? by AQR](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/Journal-Article/Which-Trend-Is-Your-Friend)):
    using some fixed lookback you can time market cycles and capture more upside than
    downside and therefore improve performance vs buy and hold OR at the very least
    improve return versus downside risk. The problem lies in the “fixed” portion of
    the description: markets as we know are non-stationary and business cycles can
    vary widely.'

    to past corrections. The chart below from [“Towards Data Science”](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-the-2020-us-stock-market-drop-using-data-visualizations-bccd2d91bf9f)
    shows a comparison of the drawdown depth and number of days it took to get near
    the bottom.

    2018 were also relatively fast selloffs and that ***this may be a defining feature
    of the modern environment***. One can speculate rationally as to the cause of
    this situation; monetary policy driven asset bubbles via low interest rates that
    artificially inflate assets like balloons that expel quickly when the air is removed,
    and/or computerized trading that take advantage of sellers by moving prices rapidly
    away as pressure increases. Regardless of the reason, the reality is that markets
    seem to take the escalator up and the elevator down in today’s day and age. Traditional
    methods that rely on linear and static time-based lookbacks have been doing quite
    poorly which is not surprising. An article chronicling the struggles of trend-followers

    struggles seemed to start around 2015\. I know what some of you are thinking:
    tactical long-only trend-following with ETFs is not the same as long/short hedge
    funds that trade futures. You are right and wrong: right in the sense that long
    only ETF has a tendency to profit from asset class positive drift, whereas long/short
    has no such favorable tailwinds especially with low interest rates. But wrong
    in the sense that this doesn’t discount the timing component of returns which
    has been unfavorable for equity indices. The problem is more straightforward when
    you consider how trend-following generates excess returns. In a fantastic [post

    oscillation period (roughly half the lookback) then you will lose money via whipsaw.
    This is made worse if the oscillation period is asymmetric such as when it takes
    longer to go up than down. Most trend-followers or tactical managers employ a
    1-year or 6-month lookback. These can be too long if the drawdown materializes
    within less than a quarter. Furthermore using holding periods that are monthly
    rather than daily inspection also introduces more luck into the equation since
    drawdowns can happen at any time rather than on someone’s desired rebalancing
    period. Savvy portfolio managers use multiple lookbacks and holding periods in
    order to reduce the variance associated with not knowing what the oscillation
    period will look like. ***However this does not address the core problem which
    requires a more dynamic or nonlinear approach***.

    optimization based on previous data. Even if this is walk-forward there is a considerable
    lag in the adjustment period. There is a simple way to account for oscillations
    that may occur more rapidly and potentially in a non-linear fashion. ***To state
    the obvious the concept of a “drawdown” is itself a nonlinear variable that is
    independent of time and is the most directly tied to investor profits*** which
    makes it a good candidate for making adjustments. Furthermore small drawdowns
    (corrections) based on the analysis presented in the paper above require longer
    lookbacks, while large drawdowns (that precede rebounds) require shorter/faster
    lookbacks. ***If we can use a relative measure of historical drawdowns within
    an adaptive framework this should more directly solve the problem.*** In this
    case we don’t care about how many turning points there are (which is the assumption
    made by choosing a static lookback) but rather how to adjust to them in a logical
    way.

    critical to choose all-time, 1-year highs work well too). Then find the empirical
    distribution of such drawdowns using some lookback using a percentile ranking
    over the past 6 months (again not critical can use longer or shorter or a combination).
    I use the square of this value for the simple reason that we want to ignore small
    drawdowns and focus on larger drawdowns to make lookback length adjustments (remember
    corrections require long-term lookbacks and rebounds after large drawdowns require
    short-term lookbacks). Next choose a short-term trend-following lookback and a
    long-term lookback. In this case I chose 50 and 200 which are often followed by
    market participants via their respective moving averages but again the parameter
    choice is not critical. One practical point is that it is inefficient to use a
    really short-term lookback for tactical trading such as 20 days. We can calculate
    the optimal alpha of a moving average using the exponential moving average framework
    as follows:'

    highs and faster after large drawdowns exactly as we would expect. The result
    is that it permits both earlier exits and entries into the market. The latter
    is far more important given the tendency for the market to make “V-shaped” recoveries.
    But to test this theory we need to backtest over a long time period and compare
    to traditional static lookbacks. Instead of using fixed holding periods we will
    do daily signal generation at the close. Since an adaptive moving average is not
    as effective as a simple moving average as a low pass filter it is important to
    filter the price when using a traditional price vs moving average strategy. To
    filter price I take the 10-day moving average of price (could be 3 could be 15
    doesn’t matter that much). Note that the price (or filtered price) vs moving average
    in an exponential moving average framework is mathematically equivalent to momentum.
    **Therefore using a price vs ema in this context is basically an adaptive momentum
    calculation.** Here is what Adaptive Momentum looks like vs typical static lookbacks:'

    difference is in risk-adjusted returns (sharpe) and higher moments (skew and kurtosis).
    Adaptive Momentum has more positive skew and lower kurtosis indicating higher
    upside/downside capture and lower tail risk. What is most impressive is that it
    does so with nearly the same number of trades as 12-month time series momentum.
    If you look carefully at the line chart you can see that Adaptive Momentum does
    much better in recent years than the static lookbacks which we would expect. Overall
    performance is impressive and this can be considered as a practical approach for
    tactical asset allocation. An interesting note is that if you dispense with the
    percentile ranking in the calculation and simply increase the lookback to the
    maximum when the market is making new highs, and decrease the lookback to the
    minimum when the market is not making new highs you get pretty similar performance.
    Overall, the strategy doesn’t exhibit much parameter sensitivity at all.

    intuitive sense and produces worthwhile results. Given a choice between static
    and adaptive/dynamic I would personally take this type of approach for real-life
