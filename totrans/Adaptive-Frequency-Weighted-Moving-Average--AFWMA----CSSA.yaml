- en: One of the unique aspects of modelling financial time series  is that recent
    data is more important than previous data. This is because forecasts need to be
    made for the next time period, and prices compound in value over time. The other
    unique aspect of time series data is that there tends to be a combination of random
    noise and mean-reverting tendencies (especially at shorter frequencies). The researcher
    often faces a tradeoff between weighting based on recency versus amplifying the
    noise and mean-reversion that exists at shorter frequencies. This tradeoff is
    logical, and should be captured explicitly as a function in an adaptive framework
    (success-weighted) versus back-testing different weighting schemes hindsight.

    prices are weighted in direct proportion to their recency (the recency rank divided
    by the sum of recency ranks times the price at time t). This link demonstrates
    the calculation : [http://www.investopedia.com/articles/technical/060401.asp](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/technical/060401.asp) .
    Alternatively,  the best way to eliminate disturbances induced by shorter frequencies
    is to middle weight the data. That is, we want to give data closest to the middle
    higher values than more recent data. This is best accomplished using a triangular
    moving average, which is essentially a moving average of the moving average of
    the same length. The smoothing induced by a triangular moving average creates
    maximum weighting on the middle value. The calculation is described here: [http://daytrading.about.com/od/indicators/a/Triangular.htm](http://daytrading.about.com/od/indicators/a/Triangular.htm).

    (**wtma**), which is exactly the same except it uses the weighted moving average
    versus the simple moving average in the calculation. Thus the Adaptive Frequency
    Weighted Moving Average can be calculated simply as:'

- en: The purpose of the AFWMA is to find the optimal balance between recency and
    avoiding short-term noise. This can be found by solving for “w” to best minimize
    out of sample error in a forecast format, or to best maximize out of sample sharpe
    in a trading strategy format. It is a simple and logical way of compressing the
    value/information content that differs between the weighted and triangular moving
    averages without resorting to blind optimization (or worse yet the beliefs/opinions
    of a technical analysis “guru”).
