- en: Investors are often looking for uncorrelated returns so as to better diversify.
      If one looks at world indices &  equities, there is much less diversity between
    assets than there was a decade ago, indeed the cross-market correlations are remarkably
    high.

- en: On the other hand, from a trading perspective, generally want to be able to
    reduce the risk by hedging or spreading against related assets.   For example
    in FX, when market making the G10 currencies, one typically offsets inventory
    risk with a position in another highly correlated currency or portfolio of currencies.

    FX, IR, world indices, and commodities.

    of FX, IR, Commodities, and world indices.   To reduce the impact of outliers
    (return spikes), made use of my Minimum Covariance Determinant covariance implementation.

    trading patterns as opposed to fundamentals at this point.   Should Bitcoin become
    more of a transactional “currency” may start to see more fundamental linkages.
