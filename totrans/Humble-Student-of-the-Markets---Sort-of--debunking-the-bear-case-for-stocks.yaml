    history. While the last 20 years is interesting, past instances of momentum rollover
    has not necessarily resulted in bear markets. The chart below depicts the SPX
    and its rolling 5-year rate of change. While the current ROC peak is higher than
    the 2007 peak and similar in magnitude to the NASDAQ peak, momentum peaks during
    the 1955-1980 period have not necessarily resulted in bear markets.

    economy was growing fast enough to withstand the withdrawal of monetary stimulus.
    Such episodes have been associated with economic growth, which has pushed EPS
    to greater levels. In short, we need to see earnings growth for this stock market
    to go up.
