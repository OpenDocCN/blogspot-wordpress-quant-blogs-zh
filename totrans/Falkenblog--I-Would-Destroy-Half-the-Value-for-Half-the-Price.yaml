    2009 and 2010, but then you knew he would make that up and so in March 2011 he
    was given a $23MM 'retention award'. As CEO, he has a lot of power so it's hard
    to avoid this, and to me it highlights the problems of allocating incentives and
    rights in large collectives. While I'm a critic of these poor CEOs getting large
    payouts, I don't think the solution is obvious. After all, Clinton's millionaire
    tax in circa 1994 gave birth to the stock option boom that probably exacerbated
    the tech bubble and the fraud in companies like WorldCom and Enron.

    their money, but unlike government money, this is other people wasting their own
    money. Sure, Citi was backstopped in the bailout, but 1) they couldn't have refused
    it 2) they paid it all back and 3) that's not a reason to regulate Citi more,
    rather, to not bailout big banks.  The solution to bad regulation isn't more regulation,
    but less. It's not only creates more efficient incentives and allocation of risk
    and capital, but is far easier to implemented.

    controls with regard to key internal data flow systems such as spreadsheets. These
    controls should take the form of, among others, input validations, change and
    release management, disaster recovery and documentation.

    into into manageable pieces. One simply can't manage something that big, as the
    big banks are demonstrating.
