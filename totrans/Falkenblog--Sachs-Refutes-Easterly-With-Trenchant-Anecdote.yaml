- en: In a particularly trenchant passage, he gently fillets critics, like William
    Easterly, who have argued that foreign aid doesn’t work. (Aid money spent bringing
    fertilizer to India in the 1960s, Sachs notes, yielded spectacular returns.)

    Trillion dollars on Africa, with zero, if not negative returns. And Sachs refutes
    Easterly's criticisms with a specific subsidy that worked. Well, with 1 trillion,
    I would hope he would have several anecdotes.

    can’t get us out of the mess markets have created.

    No one who believes in market solutions thinks they are perfect, or don't require
    good institutions, which necessarily involve governments. It amazes me how incredibly
    dumb such people can be, yet write for the New York Times book review, surely
    one of the mosts prized positions in book reviewing. And people complain that
    our process for choosing a President is suboptimal.
