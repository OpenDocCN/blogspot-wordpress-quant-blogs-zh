- en: the government wants to put some bureaucrat in place of you actually knowing
    your own DNA! Alas, it isn't obvious that Democrats or Republicans are against
    this lame political intrusion. Do I have enough official credentials to know my
    BMI? My height and weight? The formula for the BMI? My IQ?

    get access to your genetic information. Professionals who will be well paid to
    “interpret” a complex morass of statistical data which they barely comprehend.
    Let’s be real here: someone who regularly reads this blog (or Dr. Daniel MacArthur
    or Misha’s blog) knows much more about genomics than 99% of medical doctors. And
    yet someone reading this blog does not have the guild certification in the eyes
    of the government to “appropriately” understand their own genetic information.
    Someone reading this blog will have to pay, either out of pocket, or through insurance,
    someone else for access to their own information. Let me repeat: the government
    and professional guilds which exist to defend the financial interests of their
    members are proposing that they arbitrate what you can know about your genome.'
