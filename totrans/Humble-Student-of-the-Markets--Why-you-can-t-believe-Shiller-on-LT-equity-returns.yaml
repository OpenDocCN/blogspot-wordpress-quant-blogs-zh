- en: The lesson was, the longer your time frame and the more patient you are, equities
    win. That`s been a lesson taught to generations. Based on this data, equities
    has become the foundation of any portfolio for anyone building a long-term investment

    a long-term portfolio, I would content that Shiller`s analysis is at best, exaggerated
    because of survivorship bias, and at worst, deceptive. It is reminiscent of glossy
    brochures and offering memorandums promising great things, but leaving out key
    details.
