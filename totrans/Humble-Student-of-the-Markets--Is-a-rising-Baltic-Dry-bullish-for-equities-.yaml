- en: The Baltic Dry Index (BDI) continues to rise. Many consider this an excellent
    sign for the world economy. The BDI is an index that measures the price of shipping
    dry bulk cargo, which includes coal, iron ore, and grain. Since the index is used
    to gauge the demand for major raw materials used in the early stages of production,
    it is regarded as a leading indicator for the economy…

    is a bullish sign for the market…History seems to back up this theory, as the
    SPX''s returns following this signal outperform the index''s typical returns.
    In the eight instances that the BDI rose above its 200-day moving average, there
    were positive returns seven times during the six months following the signal.
    ***The average six-month return for the SPX following such a move in the BDI is
    7.24%. That''s more than double the SPX''s typical six-month return of 3.02%.***'

    S&P 500 sounds intriguing, the long term picture shows virtually no relationship
    between the BDI and the stock market.

- en: The chart below shows the indexed returns of the two indices from 1985\. The
    correlation of monthly changes between the BDI and S&P 500 from January 2007 was
    0.33, which is relatively high to suggest some causal relationship. Looking longer
    term, the correlation of monthly changes was a miniscule 0.07, indicating little
    or no relationship between the two indices.

- en: I have actually done a rather in-depth BDI correlation study in the past during
    my tenure as shipping analyst at Citi. One important thing to note about correlation
    is that you need to look at correlations for many different time periods because
    if you just calculate a single correlation then it will be highly dependent on
    your start and end dates…

- en: I think its even best to step back from numbers or historical correlations and
    think about some very important differences between the nature of the BDI and
    the nature of a stock price for a company or market. The BDI measures the rate
    to ship something around the world, ie. the COST to ship something around the
    world. On the other hand, the stock of a company represents ownership of a productive
    asset, a company. (well, at least usually they are productive!) A company is seeking
    ways to be more efficient, grow the size of its business and generally increase
    its value.
