    his role in an alleged scheme in which he and his partners used kickbacks to gain
    an advantage in lucrative cases, I was happy. A great picture of his 'I'm sorry
    face', as he said to the court, "My contrition is profound and genuine." I'm sure
    he is very sorry...he is going to jail for 30 months.

    support of leniency, meaning, in effect, Mr. Weiss still has sufficient status
    and power to make a lot of otherwise good people to totally rationalize his reprehensible
    actions on account of the fact that ... he's rich, and he might be able to get
    my daughter an internship someday. Everyone on that list is a toady. And why shouldn't
    he be so respected, as from 1983 to 2005, according to a government filing in
    the case, Mr. Weiss's share of firm profits was about $209.9 million. Rich=Good,
    except when you are running for president, or writing your memoirs, when it's
    best to brag about your parents being from the working class.

    jail. I don't think that's justice. It reminds me of this woman who made $20MM
    in PIPES, and was breaking the rules, selling short before she should have. Anyway,
    she paid $2MM in fines and was banned from the industry for 2 years. That's hardly
    a disincentive.
