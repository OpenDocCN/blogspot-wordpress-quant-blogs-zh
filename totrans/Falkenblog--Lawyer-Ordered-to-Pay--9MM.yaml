    his role in an alleged scheme in which he and his partners used kickbacks to gain
    an advantage in lucrative cases, I was happy. A great picture of his 'I'm sorry
    face', as he said to the court, "My contrition is profound and genuine." I'm sure
    he is very sorry...he is going to jail for 30 months.

  zh: 当梅尔文·魏斯因涉及一起涉嫌他和合作伙伴用回扣获取有利可图的案件中的角色而被判处 30 个月监禁，并支付了 9 亿美元罚款时，我感到高兴。有一张他的'对不起'脸的照片，当他对法庭说：“我的悔悟是深刻和真诚的”，我相信他是非常抱歉的……他要被监禁
    30 个月。
- en: But the article also noted that Mr. Weiss was able to produce 275 letters in
    support of leniency, meaning, in effect, Mr. Weiss still has sufficient status
    and power to make a lot of otherwise good people to totally rationalize his reprehensible
    actions on account of the fact that ... he's rich, and he might be able to get
    my daughter an internship someday. Everyone on that list is a toady. And why shouldn't
    he be so respected, as from 1983 to 2005, according to a government filing in
    the case, Mr. Weiss's share of firm profits was about $209.9 million. Rich=Good,
    except when you are running for president, or writing your memoirs, when it's
    best to brag about your parents being from the working class.

  zh: 但文章还指出，魏斯先生能够出示 275 封支持宽大处理的信，实际上，魏斯先生仍具有足够的地位和权力，使很多原本善良的人为他的不可原谅的行为合理化，原因是...他很有钱，也许将来能帮我女儿安排实习。那些人都是马屁精。他为何会受到如此尊重呢，因为据案件中政府的一份文件显示，1983年至2005年间，魏斯先生所在公司的利润约为
    2.099 亿美元。富裕=善良，除非你要竞选总统，或写自传，这时最好是吹嘘你的父母来自工人阶级。
- en: So, make $209.9 million scamming the system, pay $9MM and spend 30 months in
    jail. I don't think that's justice. It reminds me of this woman who made $20MM
    in PIPES, and was breaking the rules, selling short before she should have. Anyway,
    she paid $2MM in fines and was banned from the industry for 2 years. That's hardly
    a disincentive.

  zh: 所以，通过欺骗系统获得 2.099 亿美元，支付 9 亿美元并在监狱度过 30 个月。我不认为这就是正义。这让我想起了这位通过 PIPES 赚取了 2
    亿美元的妇女，违反规则，卖空的时间太早了。不管怎样，她支付了 2 亿美元的罚款，并且被禁止在业内工作 2 年。这根本不是威慑。
