- en: It will take a significant change in attitude for Chinese investors to starting
    bailing out of property. How and when that will happen, I am not sure. But of
    course, that’s the tricky thing about bubbles — since the beliefs that sustain
    them are not based in economic reality, but in economic misconceptions, psychology,
    not economics, is what finally tilts the balance one way or the other. If the
    market stumbles, and that stumble confirms growing fears on the part of investors,
    the turn in sentiment can be severe, all out of proportion to any real change
    in underlying conditions. Will this happen in China, now that property prices
    seem to be going soft? Possibly.

    about government plans to “cool” the real estate sector, a lot of them started
    putting their money into gold instead. Jade, artwork, antiques, or even stockpiles
    of commodities like copper or nickel are potential alternatives. We could even
    see a situation where Chinese investors bail out of real estate in some cities,
    which they see as vulnerable, only to buy property in others — in which case,
    we could see some markets drop while others continue rising, for now at least.

    and try to turn the proceeds into buying power to improve their quality of life,
    expect a surge in consumer inflation. Given the explosion in China’s money supply
    (by more than 50% over the past two years), the question isn’t why inflation is
    treading 5%, but why we haven’t seen more inflation sooner. The main reason is
    because most of that new money went into investment rather than consumption, mainly
    fueling asset inflation. But if those inflated asset values are suddenly transformed
    into higher consumer demand, the CPI rates we’ve seen so far will look like small
    potatoes.

    money supply will decline — in effect, a lot of the money that was created the
    past two years will simply disappear. This is what happens during a credit crisis,
    and it’s called liquidation. The good news: no more worries about inflation. The
    bad news: a lot of financial assets people thought they owned will go up in smoke.'

    IPO and concluding that it was a sign of froth and it would be wise to stay away
    from the sector. That assessment eventually proved to be correct, but in the meantime,
    the markets saw the run up in internet stalwarts like AOL, Amazon, Yahoo! and
    a whole host of others, as well as the takeover of Netscape by AOL, before the
    whole house of cards collapsed on us. Yet others who timed the Tech Wreck top
    correctly are (rightly) hailed as heroes.
