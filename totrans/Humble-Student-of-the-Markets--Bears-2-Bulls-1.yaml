- en: Here is my take on the current technical position of the market. As the chart
    below shows, the SPX bounced off support at 1840 and rallied for two days. However,
    the rally was on declining volume, which is never a good sign, and the index is
    approaching a couple of technical resistance levels. One is shown by an uptrend
    that stretches back to early February; and the other is a well defined resistance
    zone at the 1874-1884 level.

    but the technical effects of the damage is likely to be long lasting. The chart
    below shows a composite index that I built based on an equally-weighted long position
    in the NASDAQ 100 and Russell 2000 (high beta risk-on index) minus an equally
    weighted short position in the defensive sectors of Consumer Staples, Telecom
    and Utilities (low beta risk-off index), where the composite Risk Appetite Index
    is set at 100 on December 31, 2011.

    started to roll over. This picture of fading risk appetite forms a negative divergence
    when compared to the SPX, which remains in an uptrend.

    of the Industrial sector (XLI) and the Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index (CYC) against
    SPX, remains in an uptrend, which is a constructive signal for the stock market.
    For now, Mr. Market is giving the cyclical recovery story the benefit of the doubt.

    the game by no means over. In order for the correction to continue, we need to
    see a combination of further technical deterioration, such as a decisive violation
    of the 1840 level, a downturn in the CapEx Index or some exogenous event, such
    as further tensions in eastern Ukraine or heightened fears of a China crash.

    market that a cyclical acceleration of growth is indeed at hand. Their cause could
    be helped by further dovish pronouncements from the Federal Reserve or news of
    a decisive stimulus program out of Beijing.
