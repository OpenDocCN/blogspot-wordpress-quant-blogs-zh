    for the top 4-5 bitcoin exchanges, collect L3 data, and provide a consolidated
    live orderbook for trading.   So far have implemented OKCoin and been experimenting
    with the others to determine their API capabilities.

    technology (at least on the market data side).  They implemented FIX 4.4 last
    Nov, however is broken in that requests for full OB fail to work as documented
    (if anyone has had any success with this, please let me know).   BTCChina has
    an alternative public WebSocket/JSON API which provides just 5 orderbook levels.
     However, there appears to be a “secret” API which provides full depth-of-book,
    as real-time UIs ( such as bitcoinwisdom) show activity beyond 5 levels (if anyone
    knows how this works, please let me know).  **Addendum**: I have reached out to
    BTCChina, hopefully they will address the FIX depth-of-book subscription issue
    and not treat it as a feature.'

    active orderbook of the lot.  The good news is that its FIX API works as documented.
      Activity-wise, have been receiving 20+ transactions every 100-300ms or 15ms
    between transactions on average.  This degree of activity rivals more traditional
    markets.   That said, have suspicions that the exchange or a market-making partner
    (with 0 transaction cost) is constantly pumping both sides of the market in the
    1st 3-5 levels of the orderbook.   The pattern I saw was very shallow orders (1/10th
    BTC) on the 1st 3-5 levels of both sides of the market getting swept on either
    side alternatively.'

    be ignored, even though has a ill-advised market data API.   They are beta-testing
    AlphaPoint’s “modern” exchange implementation.  Once that hits production should
    expect both FIX and binary streaming feeds.   I don’t know whether these will
    provide a L2 (depth of book) or L3 (order transactions) view of the exchange.
     Either would be very welcome.'

     Given its troubles, I wonder whether it will survive.   Though it has a “secret”
    API providing L3 data, the technology backing the exchange is suspect.  In particular,
    its matching engine has both [improper matching semantics](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1r4d6t/bitstamps_streaming_api_and_exploitation/
    "improper matching semantics") (documented on reddit) and is **very slow**, where
    sweeping a few levels can take seconds to execute.   Short of Bitstamp reinventing
    itself both in terms of technology and trust, the question is then, who will replace
    them as the #2 presence in the BTC/USD market?'

- en: '**Coinbase** or the yet-to-be launched Gemini, may be the successor to Bitstamp
    in terms of market position (or perhaps even take on Bitfinex).  With respect
    to market data, it provides a complete list of orders in the orderbook. **Update**:
    Coinbase has a streaming API & with level 3 data, my mistake.  ~~However this
    must be queried by polling their REST/json API.   As you can imagine, this is
    not a scalable approach – the # of orders will grow over time to the point where
    the message size will be overwhelming on a periodic frequency.   The right solution
    is a streaming API with order transaction “deltas” {new order, del order, update
    order, etc}.    The most basic design, scale, & accessibility mistakes have been repeated,
    and on a high profile exchange launch (regulated, NYSE-backed, etc).~~'

    would be to find a way to use for trading, and avoid situations where unlikely
    to be able to execute.   With respect to unresponsive crosses in larger price
    movements, the question is whether this is due to poor matching engine technology
    (where the OB may be overwhelmed)[1] or whether is being done intentionally “for
    the house”[2].   It seems very likely that the exchanges are trading on their
    own behalf in addition to providing exchange services.

    "disappeared") with $3B HKD worth of deposits from customers.   I think there
    is enough fraud and poor market practices in the bitcoin space, that a certain
    level of regulation and regulated exchanges will be welcomed.

- en: My overall impression with (most of) the exchange Bitcoin technology is that
    it has been designed by the typical full-stack web app developer, taking few learnings
    from traditional markets or applying common sense with respect to scale.   Polling
    with REST/JSON is one of the dumbest ideas that is pervasive in Bitcoin exchanges
    (though for some uses is fine).   With this sort of exterior interface / design
    decision, one has to wonder what other marvels are present behind the scenes.

    more sophistication and sensible design.   I would be happy to consult with these
    exchanges to move their APIs and implementations towards the state of the art,
    if for no other reason then to make these better venues for trading.
