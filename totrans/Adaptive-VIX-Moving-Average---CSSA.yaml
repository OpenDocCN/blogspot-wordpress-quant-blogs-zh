    strategies that can adapt to different market regimes. The most obvious is a change
    in the forecast or implied volatility as proxied by the VIX. During more volatile
    periods we would expect more signal noise and during less volatile periods we
    would expect less signal noise. But how do we capture this in a strategy? One
    method is to use the VIX to standardize returns as presented on this blog used
    [“VIX-Adjusted Momentum” in this post](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2014/07/29/vix-adjusted-momentum/).
    An excellent recent [follow-up analysis was done by Justin Czyszczewski](https://justinczyszczewski.com/vix-and-trend-following/)
    which showed that VIX-adjusted trend-following has been recently very successful
    during these fast moving markets (Tip: using the median or average of O,H,L,C
    of VIX versus closing data will make the edge of the original strategy more consistent
    across history). I will show a new variation using this framework very soon in
    a follow-up post.'

    of the VIX. So how would we do that? Enter the [basic adaptive moving average
    framework](https://www.tradingtechnologies.com/xtrader-help/x-study/technical-indicator-definitions/adaptive-moving-average-ama/)
    which seeks to vary the speed or lookback of the moving average as a function
    of some volatility or trend-strength function.

    measure of how high or low volatility has been relative to past history. If it
    is higher we want to smooth more or have a longer lookback, and if it is lower
    we want to have a shorter lookback. This can be accomplished as follows:'

    1 divided by the current average VIX over the past 10-days. To visualize how this
    moving average works we can see it applied to the S&P500 (SPY) in the chart below:'

    and then filters out noise by becoming smoother during corrections. This is exactly
    what we want to see! Now lets compare a standard 200-day sma strategy that uses
    the current price versus using the Adaptive VIX Moving Average filter.

    also happens to come with far fewer trades (48 vs 164) which would even further
    boost net performance. The results are in the table below:'

    average on the AMA line to create faster crossover strategies that are more responsive
    to market conditions. Ultimately this is a very simple and intuitive way to adjust
    standard trend-following as a function of changing volatility regimes.
