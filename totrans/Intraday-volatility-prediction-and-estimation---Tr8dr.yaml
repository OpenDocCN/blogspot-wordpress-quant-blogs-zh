- en: GARCH has been shown to be a reasonable estimator of variance for daily or longer
    period returns. Some have adapted GARCH to use intraday returns to improve daily
    returns. GARCH does very poorly in estimating intra-day variance, however.

- en: The GARCH model is based on the empirical observation that there is strong autocorrelation
    in the square of returns for lower frequencies (such as daily). This can be easily
    seen by observing clustering and “smooth” decay of squared returns on daily returns
    for many assets.

- en: Intra-day squared returns, however, have many jumps, with little in the way
    of autocorrelated decay pattern. Looking at the EUR/USD series, the squared returns
    have jumps that reduce the ML to the point where GARCH parameterization does not
    converge.  There does appear to be a longer-term pattern, though, allowing for
    a model, though not GARCH.

- en: With expanded processing power and general access to tick data, research has
    begun to focus on intra-day variance estimation. In particular, expressing variance
    in terms of price duration has become an emergent theme. Andersen, Dobrev, and
    Schaumburg are among a growing community developing this in a new direction.

    but am planning to use for a daily strategy. I am investigating a formulation
    of a duration based measure for intra-day volatility.
