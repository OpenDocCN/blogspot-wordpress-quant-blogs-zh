    called Infernal Machina, is a throwback to the glory days of Magma, and to tell

    group consisted of two drummers (one playing a large Japanese Koto drum), bass,
    guitar, electric piano, and two vocalists. One of the vocalists was Klaus Blasquiz,
    who was Magma’s vocalist during the glory years. The other vocalist was a tall,
    blond woman who was the subject of much conversation over the next three days.

    the full force of the composition. Most of the hour-long piece consisted of the
    group jamming out on various old Magma themes, including parts of MDK, Kohntarkosz
    (the ending section), and De Futura. I loved it.

- en: In a portent of things to come, Magma also had technical issues at the start.
    They opened the concert with a brand new piece, only to have Bussonet’s amplifier
    shut off after the first few chords. Vander signaled for the band to stop, and
    Bussonet took a few minutes to rectify the situation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first piece is unnamed as of now. To my ears, it sounds as if Christian
    Vander has been listening to a lot of Steve Reich. Two main themes play off of
    each other in this composition. First, there is a Reich-like ostinato pattern
    that is played by the vibes, guitar, and electric piano. This is overlaid by a
    more Magma-like vocal line that is sung by Herve Aknin, the new vocalist who recently
    replaced Antoine Paganotti. As these two themes move in and out of phase, the
    drums and bass punctuate the music with a series of intermittent crashes. This
    goes on for about ten minutes, building up to a climax.
  prefs: []

- en: The second piece was a real snoozer for me. It is a 25 minute piece named Felicite
    Thosz, and is reminiscent of the vocal-intensive Magma offshoot called Offering.
    To my ears, it sounded like a combination of Magma playing Christmas songs with
    Magma doing a mouthwash commercial. There were lots of vocal solos and harmonies
    and sleigh bells … and for me, a reason to catch up on my sleep. A bit of promise
    in the last section with a Russian-dance theme, ala Wurdah Itah, but no real punch.
    Polite applause from the audience at the end.

    that includes Kohntarkosz and Theusz Hamtaahk. It is an hour-long piece that unites
    several of Magma’s previously-recorded themes. I first saw Magma perform this

    various minor ways. The piece now seems more coherent to me. The piece starts
    out with Rinde from the Attahk album, transitioning into Hhai, transitioning into
    Zombies, and ending with a dirge that represents the funeral of an Egyptian king.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Zombies section is supposed to be the atom bomb in the piece. About 10 minutes
    of unadulterated Zeuhl madness, and is supposed to be the centerpiece for Vander’s
    remarkable drumming. For the first night, Vander seemed rather subdued. I am not
    sure if it is his age catching up to him or the tendonitis that has been bothering
    him for the past few years.

- en: E-R was followed by the cacophonous De Futura. This is a Jannick Top composition
    that appeared on the Magma album, Udu Wudu, in 1976\. When it was recorded, it
    was a sparse but rhythmically driven piece that only included bass, drums, occasional
    synthesizer, and growling vocals. However, for the 3 concerts, it was played by
    the total combined forces of Magma and Infernal Machina. 15 people on the stage,
    including 3 drummers, two guitars, two basses, two pianists, and 5 vocalists.
    All I can say is “What a mess!” Remember the blond vocalist from Infernal Machina?
    The running joke during the 3 nights of the show was “What will she be wearing
    during De Futura?” Each night, she seemed to come out with less and less clothes
    on, and during the afternoon, she must have been shopping for her next costume
    at the shops next to the Moulon Rouge. The performance of De Futura was extremely
    sloppy, as confirmed by a lot of the opinions I heard the next day at lunch.

    English speakers, Steve Davis and his girlfriend, Jeannie, talking about Magma,
    snookers, and poker. You can actually watch videos on YouTube of Steve playing
    snookers at the various stages of his career. Steve was also able to satisfy some

    the show. Friday night’s concert was noticeably better. The word must have gotten
    to the bands about the poor performance on Thursday, and there were great improvements
    in the sound and in the quality of playing. It was the same set list, but it seemed
    that Infernal Machina really jammed out on the De Futura-sounding section, and
    Magma did the same on the Zombies section of E-R. And, the blond vocalist did
    not disappoint, as she seemed to outdo her previous night’s antics. Would someone
    tell Jannick that her presence on stage seriously detracts from his music!
