    exchange-traded products in [VIX ETP Returns for Q1 2012](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2012/04/vix-etp-returns-for-q1-2012.html)
    and barely a month ago that I examined in some detail the workings of two [VIX
    ETPs](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20ETN), [VQT](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VQT)
    and [XVZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XVZ), in [Dynamic VIX ETPs
    as Long-Term Hedges](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2012/03/dynamic-vix-etps-at-long-term-hedges.html).
    When stocks fall and volatility rises, however, which VIX ETP hedges work the
    best?

- en: The answer is not so simple, unless you know when volatility will begin to spike,
    how far it will go and how long it will take to get there. Even then, it would
    still be helpful to know what happens to the [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures)
    [term structure](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/term%20structure)
    along the way.  Also, there are liquidity constraints that will probably limit
    the choices for most investors to a half dozen or fewer alternatives.

    heuristics and alternative approaches. The first graphic below, for instance,
    illustrates the performance since the April 2 close of five representative and
    relatively liquid VIX ETPs ([TVIZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TVIZ)
    was excluded on the grounds of liquidity; its performance during the period was
    similar to that of [VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX)) that
    can be used as hedges. For the most part, the performance trend is the opposite
    of what was [observed](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2012/04/vix-etp-returns-for-q1-2012.html)
    during the first quarter.

    last five trading days. With +2x leverage and a short-term (weighted average of
    one month) maturity, [TVIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TVIX)
    (red line) was the standout in the group. The second best performer during the
    selloff was VXX (blue line), a +1x short-term product.  The +1x mid-term (weighted
    average of one month) maturity [VXZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXZ)
    (green line) ETP has also been a strong performer, certainly worthy of a bronze
    medal. All three hedges have gained more than 10% during the last five trading
    days, while the S&P 500 index (black line) has fallen 4.3%. In sharp contrast
    to their fixed allocation brethren, the two dynamic allocation VIX ETPs have both
    hovered around the unchanged line during the selloff, with [XVZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XVZ)
    (fuchsia line) eking out a small gain after a small bounce today, while [VQT](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VQT)
    (aqua blue line) has posted a loss during the same period.

    nice profit, but the second graphic, which tracks performance of the same ETPs
    since the beginning of the year, lays out the big picture conundrum succinctly.
    In short, the most responsive hedges (TVIX, VXX, etc.) are those which have a
    fixed allocation and are most susceptible to losses due to [contango](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/contango)
    and negative [roll yield](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/roll%20yield)
    while one is waiting for a hoped-for VIX spike to materialize. The dynamic allocation
    VIX ETPs, on the other hand, are tweaked to minimize losses due to contango and
    negative roll yield and thus can be left in place for extended periods, but there
    is enough lag time built into their dynamic allocation rules so that they offer
    little protection from sudden and short-lived VIX spikes, while doing a better
    job of protecting portfolios during extended periods of volatility, such as the
    peak of European sovereign debt crisis during August-September 2011.

    choices as volatility hedges for long equity portfolios. If the timetable is uncertain
    (which is often the case) and the goal is to protect against a period of extended
    high volatility, then VXZ and VQT are likely to be more compelling alternatives.
