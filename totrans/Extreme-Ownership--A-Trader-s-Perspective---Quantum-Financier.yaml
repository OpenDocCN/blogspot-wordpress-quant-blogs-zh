    might apply to my field of choice. One of my all-time favorite books is one which
    at first glance has nothing to do with markets. In [Extreme Ownership: How U.S.
    Navy SEALs Lead and Win¹](https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Ownership-U-S-Navy-SEALs-ebook/dp/B0739PYQSS/ref=dp_kinw_strp_1)
    authors and retired Navy SEAL officers Jocko Willink and Leif Babin take us through
    the leadership lessons they learned through the treacherous streets of Ramadi
    (Iraq) during some of the heaviest fighting of that conflict. With some interpretation
    many of the principles in the book can be very useful to traders. Here is some
    of the lessons I learned in my career that can be tied in with those principles.'

    full ownership of every part of the process can one be successful in the markets.
    In practice that means understanding and taking responsibility for every step
    of the process. The research, the execution, the post-trade analysis the risk
    management, everything. Finally, by being ruthless when assessing performance
    and not making excuses for bad results, one can objectively asses the situation
    and take appropriate actions.

    desk. Working as a team all working towards the same goal it was really important
    to set a clear standard for everybody to follow. I found this particularly important
    for on boarding new team members or interns. By clearly defining the expectations
    it removed a tremendous amount of pressure from them to “do the right thing”.
    They seldom had to worry about that since the right thing to do had already been
    outlined for them. This allowed them to gain confidence early on which let them
    focus on being successful members of the team.

    member comes up with a strategy who he thinks would be worth going live with.
    The way this usually works in my experience is that the senior trader would take
    it on as part of his platform and eat the loss if the strategy doesn’t work as
    expected for whatever reason. In order for this process to work, the senior trader
    must really believe in what is being attempted. Failure to do that will only serve
    to stifle the process and embitter the creator of the strategy. It is then very
    important to commit to the idea and to believe it can be successful in order to
    make the development process work.

    to learn humility in trading; on your own, or alternatively and much more painfully,
    by having the market do it. As you can imagine the latter is quite costly at times.
    One only has to look at all the providers of “volatility strategies” subscription
    services in February to see a prime example of that. Only by ruthlessly admitting
    mistake, considering risks and weaknesses can one develop a good plan to succeed.

    not need much explanation for you dear reader as I know you are all very familiar
    with that concept. A collection of individually uncorrelated return streams is
    the only true “Holy Grail” I know of in the trading world. On the employee management
    side it also means that each member of the team must cover for one another. Trying
    to stand out individually by putting oneself before the good of the team is a
    very good way to ensure sub-optimal results. A senior trader must make that fact
    clear to everyone and tolerate no violations of any kind on that front.

    issues that can spiral out of control into catastrophic losses. In addition to

    Many dollars of mine have been lit on fire over the years to over-fitting even

    many hours in a day and if you are anything like me your to-do list is endless
    and ever-growing. From research, strategy implementation, trade monitoring, post-trade
    analysis, risk monitoring and everything in between the only way to make an effective
    dent in said to-do list and improve your platform is to aggressively prioritize
    each task and tackle them successively focusing on the highest priority one. It
    is also important to recognize that those priorities are shifting in real-time.
    For instance, focusing on research while a production algo loses connectivity
    would be a problem to say the least! Additionally, in a risk limit liquidation,
    affectionately known as a puke situation where say multiple algorithms are requiring
    immediate action all at the same time this becomes a matter of survival for a
    trading platform. If the liquidation isn’t handled in a disciplined and unemotional
    fashion it can lead to much larger losses so prioritization here again is key.

    (Asia, Europe, America) it is impossible for a senior trader to always manage
    all the minute details. In addition to that, traders responsible for the desk
    during those sessions must know what they are trying to accomplish and what they
    can and also importantly cannot do in other to reach that goal. It is no use having
    somebody sitting in front of a computer overnight without any power to make any
    real decisions. All that ends up creating is a lot of lost sleep over middle of
    the night phone conversations. Furthermore, many such situations are time-sensitive.
    One can’t afford to have the execution trader not empowered to make decisions
    once they are needed. That being said, it is critical to clearly outline what
    are the limits of that decision-making authority. This is one of the areas where
    I really struggle because it is often very difficult to own the result of something
    that you don’t end up directly causing. But the important part here is that it
    is one job to mentor and train those people so that there is no scenarios where
    they would make a decision that goes against the intent which in our case is always
    to make the most money possible while minimizing the associated risk.

    range of outcomes you will experience. When money is on the line, emotions get
    involved and having a solid plan on top of having already evaluated contingencies
    allows one to be a lot better at handling various scenarios. By being explicit
    about the plan, one also ensures that they can create a feedback look of success
    where the lesson learned are applied to future plans leveraging everyone’s experience.

    the traders executing the strategies need to have all the information they need
    to be effective. What might be less obvious is how one would manage their relationship
    to their superior. The idea here is that in the prop world capital is limited.
    As such in order to be allocated capital the partners need to have certain information.
    In order to be an effective senior trader, one must proactively provide that information
    and also periodically updating management on the process of various projects.
    That way, I have found that it is much easier to get buy-in for new ventures and
    build confidence so that over time, more leeway is available. An interesting dichotomy
    here is that by enabling your superiors to do their job more easily a senior trader
    will be more successful.

    to be certain which course of action is best. That said being indecisive is rarely
    the right decision. In my experience it is often better to decisively commit and
    make a decision that turns out to be wrong after the fact rather than wait *in
    perpetuum* for more information. By being decisive and using some prioritization
    even wrong decision become easier to handle and the resulting outcome is often
    better than the alternative on undecisive actions or worst inaction.

    able to have some success in my trading endeavors is my discipline. As the authors
    put it, “unmitigated daily discipline in all things” is truly the only edge that
    I have over my competitors. Many might think that having a high degree of self-discipline
    is coercive more than anything. That, in my experience, could not be further from
    the truth. Only by being disciplined can I have the freedom to do what is necessary
    to obtain success. Additionally, it should come as good news to every one of my
    readers that are considering putting some of their capital at risk since discipline
    is something you can start working on at any time. This is not a nature vs nurture
    situation; it is pure force of will. Anyone can reach the level of discipline
    I believe is required in order to be a successful trader.

    times than I have been successful but by constantly seeking thoughtful failure,
    I was able to find fantastic success. Something I think that is within reach for
    just about everyone with the required discipline and proper effort.
