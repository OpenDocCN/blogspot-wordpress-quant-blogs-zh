- en: The VIX has been setting records for options volume on a fairly regular basis.
    This should not come as a surprise, as VIX options are still [less than a year
    and a half old](http://www.cboe.com/otec/ETrade/micro/vix/vixoptions.aspx), making
    records easy to come by, even without resorting to steroids and corked bats.

- en: Yesterday marked [another VIX options volume record](http://www.exchange-handbook.co.uk/index.cfm?section=news&action=detail&id=68165),
    with the 322,484 contracts easily besting the previous record of 277,260 from
    back on May 16, 2007\. I generally don't bother to mention this type of news,
    because I have yet to find a meaningful relationship between [VIX futures volume](http://cfe.cboe.com/publish/ScheduledTask/MktData/datahouse/CFEVolOI.csv)
    or [VIX options volume](http://www.ivolatility.com/options.j?ticker=VIX:CBOE&R=1&period=12&chart=2&vct=)
    and subsequent market moves.

- en: Given that it's a slow day from a VIX perspective, I thought I'd throw out the
    'news' and see if any readers care to comment on VIX options volume and what it
    may tell us about the direction of the markets.
