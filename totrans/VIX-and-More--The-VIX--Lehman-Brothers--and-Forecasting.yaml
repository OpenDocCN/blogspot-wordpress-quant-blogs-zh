    to Forecast S&P 500 Drop, Loses Followers](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601110&sid=a6bJKg1wZ8Vc))
    in which the authors contend that largely because the VIX failed to predict the
    October losses in the S&P 500 index (SPX), the VIX is no longer considered to
    be an accurate gauge of future market activity.

    Inc. went bankrupt and four days after the government takeovers of Washington-based

    meant traders bet the S&P 500 wouldn’t fluctuate more than 24.39 percent on an

    the VIX calculation actually estimates one standard deviation of annualized 30
    day volatility expectations in SPX options. That standard deviation, of course,
    is meant to capture 68.3% of the Gaussian or [normal distribution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution)
    of prices. In fact, the distribution of VIX prices does not follow a normal distribution,
    but even if it did, the movements from September 11^(th) to October 10^(th) would
    not be that statistically improbable.'

    of an annualized volatility of 24.39% to 30 day volatility yields a 30 day volatility
    of 7.04%. Two standard deviations translate into a 30 day volatility of +/- 14.08%
    and should cover about 95.5% of the normal distribution (I am assuming a normal
    distribution for the sake of mathematical simplicity). Three standard deviations
    increase the range of expected volatility to +/- 21.12% and should capture about
    99.7% of the normal distribution. In fact, the 99.9% boundary for the normal distribution
    is 3.29 standard deviations and translates into expectations of an SPX move of
    23.16%, about on par with what transpired. So, given that an event which falls
    outside of 99.9% probability distribution happens once every 1000 instances. Rare
    indeed, but not unfathomable.

    Consider that the nature of the VIX calculation is such that the VIX acts as an
    unbounded [oscillator](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/oscillators)
    whose values are derived from prices paid for options on the SPX. Like most oscillators,
    traders tend to use extreme values as opportunities to bet on a [reversion to
    the mean](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/mean%20reversion).

    some of the dominant patterns are different over the course of different time
    horizons. For instance, in the short-term, the VIX commonly spikes and mean reverts.
    Looking at the intermediate term, the VIX frequently establishes strong trends;
    and in the long term, the VIX has a tendency to move in [cycles of 2-4 years](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20macro%20cycles).
    For the month of September and most of the month of October, the VIX was in an
    uncharacteristically strong sustained uptrend.

- en: Part of the reason for the sharp move in the VIX during September and October
    is that it is highly dependent upon macroeconomic and fundamental events that
    help to shape investor perceptions of uncertainty, risk and [fear](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/fear).
    In the week leading up to the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, for instance, very few
    investors believed that the government was prepared to let Lehman fail. Additionally,
    in retrospect is seems as if those who did believe failure was an option did not
    comprehend the nature of the systemic reverberations that a Lehman bankruptcy
    would trigger.

- en: The bottom line is that during the second week in September, the VIX was pricing
    in a very low probability of a Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. Perhaps more important,
    investors were also assigning a significantly lower systemic threat potential
    as a result of the dominoes associated with a Lehman bankruptcy.

    to fully price in the global systemic risks associated with the sequence of events

    of SPX options have to account not just for the probabilities associated with
    various future scenarios, but also the magnitude of the impact of those scenarios
    on the stock market. For this reason, even while some of the probabilities may
    not have varied significantly from day to day during September and October, as
    the magnitude of the financial crisis was slowly revealed, the VIX continued to
    ratchet higher – and investors reacted to a rising VIX with increasing alarm.

- en: Getting back to the question posed by Kearns and Tsang, yes the VIX underestimated
    future volatility back on September 11^(th). At that time, the prediction of a
    four year flood was consistent with mainstream thinking. Very few observers anticipated
    the SPX falling below 800 by Thanksgiving.
