    U.S. housing market by forming a venture with Brookfield Asset Management Inc.

    the highest homeownership group by age, while “echo boomers” (children of baby
    boomers) are getting to the age at which they are significantly more likely to
    own a home than the younger age group.

    relative uptrend (red channel) but testing a relative resistance level that dates
    back to 2007\. A breakout out of such a long base suggest a technical target that
    is well above the relative highs set before the Lehman Crisis of 2007\. Should
    tax-related profit taking occur, don't be surprised if these stocks pull back
    and test the bottom of the relative uptrend.
