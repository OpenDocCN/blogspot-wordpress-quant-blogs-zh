    where I typically begin to take on long index exposure. Below is a strategy report
    of the standard entry/exit technique I’ve discussed before of buying the S&P 500
    when it hits “7” or higher and then exiting on a drop to “3” or lower. Under normal
    circumstances a bounce would likely arrive in the next few days. The question
    is whether this is one of those times where things are a little different and
    become a lot scarier – like August of 1998, September of 2001 or July of 2002\.
    In cases like those you’d prefer not to get “all in” too soon.
