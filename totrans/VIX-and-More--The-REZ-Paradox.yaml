    Alpha that I thought might warrant a broader audience here.

    Fund ([REZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/REZ)) and wondered if
    apartments were behind the relative outperformance of this real estate ETF.

    in terms of square feet of living space, which is also increasing the demand for
    self-storage facilities. When you add together the 47% of REZ that is accounted
    for by apartments and 13% that is attributed to self storage, the result of the
    move from homes to apartments is a paradox of sorts in which the REZ ETF as currently
    structured should perform particularly well in a deteriorating residential real
    estate market.
