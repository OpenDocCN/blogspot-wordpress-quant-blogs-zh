- en: As Lewis Carrol noted in his wonderful books, the meaning of words can be ambiguous,
    leading to all sorts of confusion and chicanery. The word 'derivative', for example,
    applies most to synthetic CDOs, but also to options, which theoretically applies
    to equity, which is an option on a firm where the strike price is the face value
    of the debt. If that makes no sense to you, then you should not be too excited
    about financial regulation, because as soon as you regulate certain securities,
    its spirit will migrate to something else you never anticipated

    that were hot during the junk bond boom. In the internet bubble it was 'equity-based
    financing'--the equity of the firm was the collateral. In the latest, it was 'innovative
    underwritiing standards'. It's all leverage in a different product area.

    they should note that all sorts of securities are set up to go up N times as much
    as some reference index or security, where N could be negative. For example,

    of financial crises; it is less well known that this is not an aggregate property,
    but rather, concentrated in different sectors and products each time, which is
    why economists can not predict business cycles. So note that whatever is specified
    in this new financial reform bill, will just be relabeled and continue, benefiting
    securities lawyers and other middle men like Goldman Sachs who are good at this
    game.

  zh: 众所周知，过度杠杆是金融危机的一个显著特征；不那么知名的是，这并不是一个总体特征，而是集中在不同的部门和产品中，这就解释了为什么经济学家无法预测商业周期。因此请注意，在这项新的金融改革法案中规定的任何内容，都只会被重新标签并继续存在，使证券律师和其他像高盛这样擅长这种游戏的中间商得到好处。
- en: Ultimately, the only thing dampening excess is the rational foresight of investors,
    who generally get what they ask for good and hard. To the extent a certain activity
    recently caused a great deal of grief, you can be pretty sure that it will be
    safe for the next generation. That is, the great stability after the Great Depression
    was not from New Deal legislation, but its affect on the conservatism of investors
    in response to that crisis. All this financial regulation in the pipeline are
    classic hindsight fixes that just add fixed costs, as irrational and hubristic
    as any levered CDO.

  zh: 最终，唯一能够抑制过度的是投资者的理性远见，他们通常可以获得他们所要求的良好和艰难。到目前为止，某种活动最近引起了很多痛苦，你可以相当肯定，它在下一代将会变得更加安全。也就是说，大萧条之后的伟大稳定并不是来自新政的立法，而是它对投资者保守主义的影响。管道中的所有这些金融监管都是典型的事后聪明，只会增加固定成本，就像任何杠杆CDO一样非理性和自大。
