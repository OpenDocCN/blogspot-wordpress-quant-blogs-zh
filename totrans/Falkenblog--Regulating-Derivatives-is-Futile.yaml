- en: As Lewis Carrol noted in his wonderful books, the meaning of words can be ambiguous,
    leading to all sorts of confusion and chicanery. The word 'derivative', for example,
    applies most to synthetic CDOs, but also to options, which theoretically applies
    to equity, which is an option on a firm where the strike price is the face value
    of the debt. If that makes no sense to you, then you should not be too excited
    about financial regulation, because as soon as you regulate certain securities,
    its spirit will migrate to something else you never anticipated

    that were hot during the junk bond boom. In the internet bubble it was 'equity-based
    financing'--the equity of the firm was the collateral. In the latest, it was 'innovative
    underwritiing standards'. It's all leverage in a different product area.

    they should note that all sorts of securities are set up to go up N times as much
    as some reference index or security, where N could be negative. For example,

    of financial crises; it is less well known that this is not an aggregate property,
    but rather, concentrated in different sectors and products each time, which is
    why economists can not predict business cycles. So note that whatever is specified
    in this new financial reform bill, will just be relabeled and continue, benefiting
    securities lawyers and other middle men like Goldman Sachs who are good at this
    game.

    who generally get what they ask for good and hard. To the extent a certain activity
    recently caused a great deal of grief, you can be pretty sure that it will be
    safe for the next generation. That is, the great stability after the Great Depression
    was not from New Deal legislation, but its affect on the conservatism of investors
    in response to that crisis. All this financial regulation in the pipeline are
    classic hindsight fixes that just add fixed costs, as irrational and hubristic
    as any levered CDO.
