    the day. Pre-market trading is dominated by the pros. Retail traders typically
    don’t trade until the official open at 9:30am EST. I’ve heard in the past that
    big institutions that want to buy will sometimes try and push futures lower in
    the morning when there isn’t as much liquidity. They do this with the intention
    of buying at the open (at cheaper prices) when liquidity comes into the market.
    Of course news and trading of foreign markets overnight will also have much to
    do with the open. In any event, 5 gaps down in a row is fairly rare. It raises
    the question, “Does a consistently cheap open provide an edge going forward?”

    the bull case.
