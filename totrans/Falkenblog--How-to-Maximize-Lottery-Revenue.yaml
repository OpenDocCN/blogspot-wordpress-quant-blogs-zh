    in the Netherlands. Weekly it awards a "Street Prize" to one postal code, the
    Dutch equivalent of a zip code, chosen at random. When a postal code (usually
    about 25 houses on a street) is drawn, everybody who played the lottery in that
    code wins about $12,500 or more. Those living there who neglected to buy a ticket
    win nothing — except the chance to watch their neighbors celebrate.

    found, it was the idea that they might be forced to sit on the sidelines contemplating
    missed opportunity.
