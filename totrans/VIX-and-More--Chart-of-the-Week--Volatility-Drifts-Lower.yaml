    stricken from the consciousness of the bulls, volatility only grudgingly began
    to reappear on the charts.

    below, you see more concern about future volatility in the form of the VIX than
    there are indications of rising current volatility, as reflected in the [average
    true range](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/average%20true%20range)
    (ATR) of the S&P 500 index. I elected to use the 21 day setting for the ATR, as
    it is based on trading days and approximates the 30 calendar day time horizon
    used by the VIX. For the record, shortening the ATR window to 10 days shows the
    same pattern of declining volatility. The SPX [historical volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/historical%20volatility)
    picture is similarly calm, with 20 day historical volatility hovering around 31
    at the moment.

    at least as measured by post-Lehman standards.
