    and global stock market prices to generates a composite Risk-On/Risk-Off signal

    interesting, there is no substitute for actual performance. As a proof of concept,
    I started to manage a small account that traded long, inverse and leveraged ETFs
    on the major US market averages and, on occasion, sector and industry ETFs. Trading
    decisions were based on Trend Model signals combined with some short-term sentiment
    indicators. The inception date of the account was September 30, 2013 and the chart
    below represents an interim report card of that account.

    is intended to be an absolute return vehicle. While I do show the SPY total return,
    which includes re-invested dividends, for illustrative purposes, the SP 500 is
    not an appropriate benchmark for measuring the performance of this modeling technique.

- en: While these results are promising, I consider the Trend Model to be untested
    by stressful markets. I continue to be concerned about how the Trend Model would
    behave at major market turning points. In the past year, equities have more or
    less been rising steadily without a correction of 10% and pullbacks have mostly
    been short and shallow. While account performance has been admirable during these
    minor market hiccups, the biggest test for the Trend Model is how it performs
    during the volatility seen in major corrections. In particular, how will the Trend
    Model navigate the initial downturn, the volatility of the bottoming period and
    the subsequent rally?

    navigated past volatile market well as it caught the tops and bottoms of both
    major and relatively minor stock market moves in choppy markets like 2011, that

    fall, the account did not make any money from this signal during the month from
    this bearish call. The horizontal line marks the closing price of the SPX at the
    end of September. By the time the Trend Model covered its short position, marked
    by the Buy signal, the SPX had already rallied above its September close.

- en: Given the recent results, return expectations for the Trend Model trading strategy
    has been racheted up. It was indicative how outsized expectations are that, in
    a discussion I had with a business associate, the October return of 1.4% was interpreted
    as being disappointing - that is until we realized that 1.4% on an annualized
    basis comes to 18% a year.

    as the stock market has more or less risen in a straight line with very few hiccups.
    Under more normal market conditions, where the market can be expected to regularly
    correct 10% or more and move in a more choppy manner, this strategy is unlikely
    to perform as well in sideways and volatile environments. That`s why I had hoped
    to see greater market volatility in order to stress test this model.

    analogue. While there has been some financial excess, there is nothing like the
    kind of real economy excess to produce a proper meltdown/recession. As noted above,
    what we are observing is the start of a normalized volatility regime, at least
    in certain segments of financial markets. If anything, the proper historical analogue
    for next year will be 1994 or 2004- two years when stocks kind of scuffled as
    monetary policy was tightened for the first time in several years. (For fun, look
    what happened to USD/JPY on Valentine's Day 1994.)
