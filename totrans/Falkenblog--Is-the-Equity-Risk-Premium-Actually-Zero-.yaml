- en: One of the most important constants in finance is the Equity Risk premium, that
    expected return on the signature risk asset, equities, over the risk free alternative
    (usually, long-term Treasuries). It's the one risk premium that is generally considered
    positive, too large even, which is a relief because in most areas the returns
    are decidedly negative for taking more risk. Estimates in the early 1990s were
    about 8%, now, around 3% annually.

- en: over a flaw in Jeremey Siegel's famous stock return estimate going back to 1802\.
    As one would expect, stock indices prior to 1871 have a lot of survivorship bias
    issues. He suspects Siegel's index accounts for only 5% of equity investments
    actually available, and so could be severely biased, because the difference between
    the winners, and the average, is usually quite large. This highlights the many
    subtle biases in historical asset returns.

- en: I have found that on average industry stratistics are maintained by biased parties,
    because those who do the work collecting such data invariably have a vested interest
    in the asset class, and incentives matter. Little things like selection biases
    in historical reconstructions, corporate actions, can get very detailed and matter
    a great deal. I have seen performance records where I had inside knowledge of
    the guy's strategy, and every time their performance was exaggerated. People exaggerate
    with a rather straightforward, self-interested bias on things that can help them,
    and index creators invariably have a rooting interest in the asset class they
    are 'merely monitoring'.

    This is where a stock going from 100, to 200, back to 100 has an arithmetic return
    of +25%, the geometric lower, at zero. Geometric is relevant to the long-term
    investor, and most investors have a much greater volatility than the indices,
    making this estimate conservative.'
