- en: Following on from the previous posting on Sociotechnical, and David Hanna’s
    High Performance Organization book.  I want to call out page 136, “Determining
    Department Boundaries”.  When I read this section of the book, it reminded me
    of the flawed way many organization go about creating departments (unit operations)
    without looking at the work process pipeline in any detail.  The aim should be
    to create self-sufficient work units
