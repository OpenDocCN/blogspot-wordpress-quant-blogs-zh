- en: One of the most overlooked areas in trading is the focus on keeping a constant
    bet size in order to ensure consistent risk-adjusted returns. Most traders fail
    to explicitly adjust for market volatility, which can have a catastrophic impact
    when you have the misfortune of betting the wrong way when the market is swinging
    violently. The use of leverage makes this even more dangerous. However this factor
    affects the buy and hold investor as well. Portfolio management is predicated
    on creating an asset allocation for investors that have a certain risk/return
    profile based on expected returns and volatility. Most passive portfolios keep
    constant exposure to market conditions, leaving them effectively overleveraged
    when volatility spikes in years like 2008.

    of this blog, Jerry Wagner  has a great deal of experience making these types
    of decisions as the president of [Flexible Plan Investments](http://www.flexibleplan.com/).
    CSS was recently in attendance at the [NAAIM Uncommon Knowledge 2010 Conference](http://www.naaim.org/annualconference.aspx)
    in Orlando where Jerry presented an interesting technique for position sizing/hedging
    using current and historic volatility. This is the first in a two part follow-up
    to the Secret Sauce Trading Seminar at in which one of our CSS researchers—David
    Abrams—also  presented a paper.  So what is Jerry’s secret sauce to address the
    issue of maintaining constant volatility for a portfolio? The equation is really
    very simple yet mathematically elegant:'

    how to do it with leverage:'

- en: Position size of 1 means full position, 2 means 100% leverage.  So a hedge ratio
    (HR>1 and HR<2) means leverage of (HR-1).  This has the benefit of continuously
    adjusting position size based on the ratio of the historic volatility to the current
    volatility.  The numerator can be adjusted by a volatility multiplier to “target”
    a specified level of volatility and make your system more conservative or aggressive.

    leverage to control position size can reduce the max drawdown in half and almost
    double the Sharpe ratio while also slightly increasing the CAGR.

    despite using leverage explicitly. In future posts we will look at how to incorporate
    volatility and other metrics into position sizing.  These will be incorporated
    into our portfolio management tools for systems. Good work Jerry!
