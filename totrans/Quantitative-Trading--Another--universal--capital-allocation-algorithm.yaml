    rule using "multiplicative updates": the new capital allocated to a stock is proportional
    to its current capital multiplied by a factor. This factor is an exponential function
    of the return of the stock in the last period. This algorithm is both greedy and
    conservative: greedy because it always allocates more capital to the stock that
    did well most recently; conservative because there is a penalty for changing the
    allocation too drastically from one period to the next. This multiplicative update
    rule is the one proposed as a model for evolution by natural selection.'

    the latter requires a weighted average over all possible allocations at every
    step, while the former needs only know the allocation and returns for the most
    recent period. But does this EG algorithm actually generate good returns in practice?

    rate" η, which determines how fast the allocation can change from one period to
    the next. It is generally found that η=0.01 is optimal, which we adopted. Also,
    we disallow short positions in this study.

    handle the addition and deletion of stocks in the index within a constrained optimization
    function. So I opted for the shortcut of using a subset of stocks that were in
    SP500 from 2007 to 2013, tolerating the presence of surivorship bias. There are
    only 346 such stocks.

    why does it underperform so miserably? Remember that similarity here just means
