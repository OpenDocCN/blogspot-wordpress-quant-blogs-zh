    and professional tennis: for the best of the best, you need good ''winning'' shots;
    to be a good ''average'' player, you need to merely lower your failure rate. In
    expert tennis, 80% of the points are won, while in amateur tennis, 80% are lost.
    Thus, a book about being good, to be relevant, should target what group you are
    in.'

    have an edge, they should prioritize the following: minimize costs and diversify.
    For that select few with an edge, the focus is on fundamentals (financial statements,
    business model), and though you minimize costs and diversify to the degree you
    can, it isn''t a priority.'
