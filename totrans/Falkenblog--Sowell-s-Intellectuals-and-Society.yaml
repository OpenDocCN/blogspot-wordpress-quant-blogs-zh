- en: . As I'm a big fan of Friederich Hayek, the application of his seminal insight
    about how the market effectively decentralizes decision making was really enjoyable.
    That is, Sowell notes that intellectuals don't know the essential information
    of parochial time and place that is so essential. It is easy to dismiss this knowledge
    because it tends to be pedestrian, not elegant or sophisticated. Yet there are
    so many different essential facts, the sum of this simple knowledge adds up to
    100 times whatever is known by intellectuals like Paul Krugman or Ezra Klein,
    who pontificate on their industrial policies as if such details don't matter.
    Intellectuals have a tendency to dismiss this because they have often been the
    smartest person in the room growing up, and naturally assume this greater knowledge
    is also present when considering health care or energy policy, but it's just one
    of those insights that isn't obvious because they have always gotten an A+ on
    their term papers, which never actually were implemented.

  zh: 。作为弗里德里希·哈耶克的忠实粉丝，他对市场如何有效地分散决策作出了重要见解的应用真的很有趣。也就是说，索维尔指出知识分子不了解当地和当时的基本信息是多么重要。人们很容易忽视这些知识，因为它往往过于平庸，不够优雅或精致。然而，这些简单知识的总和远远超过保罗·克鲁格曼或埃兹拉·克莱恩这样的知识分子所知道的一百倍，他们在其产业政策上发表议论时似乎并不重要。知识分子倾向于不予理睬，因为他们在成长过程中通常是房间里最聪明的人，自然而然地认为在考虑医疗保健或能源政策时也持有这种更广泛的知识，但这只是一个不明显的见解，因为他们总是在学期论文上得到A+，但这些从未真正实施。
- en: The stupidity of government do-gooder regulators was really highlighted for
    me last weekend. My wife doesn't work, staying home with our 2 year-old Izzie.
    She would often go to our health club after our boys are at school, around 9 AM,
    where there is a childcare facility and she can have a leisurely workout. She
    found they needed help, and she knows people there, so she works there part time,
    around 4-hour shifts, while Izzie is in childcare. She enjoys the break from the
    kids, the adult comaraderie, and Izzie has fun playing with other kids in a room
    just down the hall from my wife. Yet last weekend OSHA, the US agency that 'regulates
    workplace safety' determined that this could not stand, because the health club's
    child care center was not licensed for such service (greater than 2 hours). Supposedly,
    they would need some extra-special licensed childcare, which would then be too
    expensive to the club. So, because some bureaucrat decided they would save workers
    from the evils of firm childcare, the health club loses out on my wife's cheap
    labor, my wife loses out on some quality no-kid/adult time, and Izzie loses out
    on playing with her snot-nosed buddies. Lose-lose-lose.

  zh: 上周末, 政府盲目的好管闲事的监管者让我特别瞧不起他们。我的妻子不工作， 和我们两岁的女儿伊齐呆在家里。孩子上学后，她经常会去我们的健身俱乐部，大约在上午9点左右，那里有托儿设施，她可以悠闲地锻炼。她发现他们需要帮助，她认识那里的人，所以她在那里兼职工作，工作时间大约是4小时，伊齐就在那里的托儿所。她享受离开孩子的休息时间，和朋友们的成人交往，而伊齐在离我妻子不远的房间里和其他孩子玩得高兴。然而，上周末，美国的职业安全与健康管理局认定这是不合法的，因为健身俱乐部的儿童托管中心并不具备服务许可（超过2小时）。据说，他们需要一些特别许可的托儿服务，这样会使健身俱乐部变得太昂贵。因此，因为一些官僚决定要拯救工作人员不受公司托儿服务的威胁，健身俱乐部失去了我妻子的廉价劳动力，我妻子失去了一些没有孩子的高质量时间，伊齐失去了和她那帮拘谨的伙伴们一起玩的乐趣。损失-损失-损失。

- en: the book, but precisely because he is the type of intellectual Sowell is criticizing.
    Indeed, he criticizes a couple of New Republic founders, so it surely hit home.
    Surely, Sowell makes generalizations that aren't always true (as if any generalization
    is always true), and even the really obtuse intellectuals had some neat insights,
    stylish prose, and witty ripostes. Yet net-net, I think Sowell is spot on. The
    contractor that can build houses on time and on budget, is so much more useful
    to society than any intellectuals with their trenchant insights on society. Yet,
    allowing them to interact in the market without top down direction is rarely considered
    optimal, as if that is like building a bridge without blueprints. It rarely occurs
    to them we need the government to get out of the way, as opposed to apply another
    top-down fix. Further, many of our big benefactors--Henry Ford, Andrew Carnegie,
    John D. Rockefeller--are presented as Robber Barons by intellectuals, as if they
    were parasites and not wealth creators. Haiti and many other countries could use
    those kind of people.

  zh: 但正因为他是索维尔所批评的那种知识分子，所以他才写了这本书。事实上，他批评了一对新共和国的创始人，所以这本书肯定深有触动。毫无疑问，索维尔做出的概括并不总是正确的（好像任何概括都总是正确的一样），即使那些确实愚钝的知识分子也有一些巧妙的见解、时尚的文笔和机智的回击。然而总的来说，我认为索维尔说得很准确。能够按时按预算建造房屋的承包商，对社会来说比具有对社会深刻洞察的任何知识分子更有用得多。然而，让他们在市场上自由互动，而不是从上而下地指导，很少被认为是最佳选择，好像那就像没有蓝图就建造桥梁一样。他们很少意识到我们需要政府让开道路，而不是施加另一个自上而下的修复。此外，我们的许多大慈善家——亨利·福特、安德鲁·卡内基、约翰·D·洛克菲勒——被知识分子们描述为强盗大亨，好像他们是寄生虫而不是创造财富的人。海地和许多其他国家都需要那样的人。
