## BUILD Conference, Will It Deliver?

So the Microsoft [BUILD](http://www.buildwindows.com/) conference is days away. There’s still little information on the [agenda](http://www.buildwindows.com/Agenda). Various [posting](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2011/09/08/delivering-fast-boot-times-in-windows-8.aspx) around Windows 8 recently hit that Win8 continues to push in the right [direction](http://www.istartedsomething.com/20110909/ipad-ios-5-android-honeycomb-opportunities-for-windows-8/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+istartedsomething+%28istartedsomething%29) after the Vista nightmare. One big question is whether Microsoft can message correctly around [RedHawk](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/ten-watchwords-for-microsofts-windows-8-conference/10539?tag=mantle_skin;content), HTML and Silverlight. Hopefully Microsoft has learnt its lessons from the last Silverlight/HTML marketing [nightmare](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/microsoft-our-strategy-with-silverlight-has-shifted/7834) that caused us all a degree of pain and madness
