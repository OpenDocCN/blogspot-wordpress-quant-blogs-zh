    not sure what to expect when I first saw [Nacho Caballero''s](https://twitter.com/nachocaballero)
    announcement. I actually was both skeptical and intimidated, but neither reaction
    was justified. The examples prove its power, and [his wiki tutorials](https://github.com/nachocab/clickme/wiki/_pages)
    ease the noobie difficulties. Very similar to shiny, clickme serves as an integration
    point for html, javascript (especially [d3](http://d3.js.org)), and R. While clickme
    does not allow the R websocket interactivity that shiny does, its more concentrated
    focus on quick reproducibility and sharing makes it a very useful tool. This is
    very much in the spirit of [http://dexvis.wordpress.com/ Reusable Charts](http://dexvis.wordpress.com/2013/03/27/reusable-charts-part-6-parallel-coordinates/).

    I just had to try to create my own ractive. I thought [Mike Bostock's line chart
    example](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3902569) would serve as a nice template for
    my first ractive. The data not surprisingly will come from the R finance package
    **PerformanceAnalytics** dataset named **managers**. With very minor modifications
    to the Bostock source and a simple custom R script translator (translator.R shown
    below), we have everything we need for this ractive, which I will call multiline.
