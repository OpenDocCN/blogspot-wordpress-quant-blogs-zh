    unusual market environment. While the 5 instances were somewhat mixed over the
    short-term, performance once you got out 13 weeks was strongly positive. For those
    interested, the trigger dates were 12/6/74, 8/8/75, 8/14/98, 8/6/99, and 7/19/02\.
    ’74 and ’02 basically marked the bottoms. The other instances did some wiggling
    around before moving smartly higher.

    basis when looking out 10-20 weeks.

    as the Nasdaq can hold on to its leadership spot, the market stands a pretty good
    chance of putting in some intermediate-term gains.
