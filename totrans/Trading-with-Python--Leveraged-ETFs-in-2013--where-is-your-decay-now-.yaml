    year. Let''s see what would happen if we shorted some of the leveraged etfs exactly
    a year ago and hedged them with their benchmark.  Knowing the leveraged etf behavior
     I would expect that leveraged etfs outperformed their benchmark, so the strategy
    that would try to profit from the decay would lose money.  I will be considering
    these pairs:  SPY 2 SSO -1  SPY -2 SDS -1 QQQ 2 QLD -1 QQQ -2 QID -1 IYF -2 SKF
    -1  Each leveraged etf is held short (-1 $) and hedged with an 1x etf. Notice
    that to hedge an inverse etf a negative position is held in the 1x etf.  Here
    is one example: SPY vs SSO.  Once we normalize the prices to 100$ at the beginning
    of the backtest period (250 days) it is apparent that  the 2x etf outperforms
    1x etf.'

    course of 2013\. According to expectations, the strategy exploiting 'beta decay'
    would not be profitable.

    does not provide any edge, unless you know the market conditions beforehand (trending
    or range-bound).  But if you do know the coming market regime, there are much
    easier ways to profit from it. Unfortunately, nobody has yet been really succesful
    at predicting the market regime at even the very short term.
