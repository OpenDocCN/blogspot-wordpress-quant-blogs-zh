- en: We have a C#/.NET-based Reuters market data adapter that we wrote ourselves
    (well, actually, I wrote it). This is an out-of-process Coral8 adapter that reads
    real-time ticks from RMDS, turns then into Coral8 tuples, and feeds them into
    our Coral8 engine. The adapter has two caches in it, and since market data is
    last reliable, we can publish the last-reliable ticks from one of the caches at
    specific intervals.

- en: When we hooked the market data adapter up to our Coral8 engine, we started seeing
    an immediate backup in the pending message queue. We were sending Coral8 about
    3000 ticks per second. In addition, our Coral8 engine was processing our order
    flow, which could hit a max of another 3000 messages per second.

- en: My first thought was that it was taking too long for Coral8 to deserialize the
    market data tuple, so I wanted to transform our market data adapter from an out-of-process
    adapter to an in-process adapter. Unfortunately, in-process adapters have to be
    written as a vanilla, Win32-based C/C++ DLL.

    .NET in 2001\. I was scared. I was frightened. However, I know that my teams needs
    some experience in writing in-process adapters for Coral8, and since my team consists
    of very strong .NET and Java people, I decided to bite the bullet and take one
    for the team.
