    of things here is an interesting POV on quote stuffing and some of the basic microstructure
    games that get played.

    of astroturf among the wild grass, weeds and occasional dead spot. What someone
    is doing is adding to the BB qty, then immediately canceling it all in rapid fire.

    Clearly some algo messing with the BBO. Now what happens if you use a ~~dumb ass~~
     simple moving average of say the last 1024 open qty levels of the BB - plot below.

    and that is how you can exploit ~~stupidity~~weakness in someones algo. Here it
    is again with a more aggressive vertical scaling

- en: Again, a beautiful manipulation of a simple moving average. So whats worse?
    Spaming the market with a bit of noise OR using a simple moving average as a signal?
    Personally Id say the latter as we`re no longer in the school yard where there`s
    no "special needs play area"... However the former is far easier to bitch and
    complain about.
