- en: While the major indices finished Thursday with mixed moderate moves, the VIX jumped
    quite a bit higher. It finished 6.7% above Wednesday’s close. It’s very unusual
    to see the VIX spike up on a day the SPX also closes higher. This is especially
    true on a day other than Monday, since Mondays show a tendency for a rising VIX.
    The study below addresses this.
