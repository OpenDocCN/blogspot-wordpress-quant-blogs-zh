- en: legislation that prohibits employers and health insurance companies from discriminating
    against people on the basis of their genetic test results. The House is expected
    to approve the measure as early as next week so it can be sent to President Bush
    for signing.

- en: The Senate vote was 95 to 0, and reflects the basic popularity of this idea.
    Earlier this year, the Genetics and Public Policy Center surveyed more than 4,000
    Americans and found that 92 percent were worried that genetic test results could
    be used against a person.

- en: Clearly, people think that things beyond one's control should not be used against
    them. But life is all about probabilities, not binary decisions, and one can't
    avoid the fact that many things beyond our control affect our probability of success
    in life. One's IQ, athleticism, extroversion, musical abilities, are all somewhat
    determined by one's genes. Sure you can make the best of what you are given, but
    it is simply improbable that you will be a PhD physicist if you have an IQ of
    85, or that you will play college football if you can't run a 40 yard dash under
    5.5 seconds, or be a good salesman if you are introverted. Some kids are not nearly
    as attractive as others. Genes affect longevity, one's propensity to develop cancer,
    or heart disease. More importantly, some genetic defects are directly related
    to one's longevity, such as type-1 diabetes, cystic fibrosis, sickle-cell anemia.

- en: A small attempt to get back at an unfair Creator. But I think it would be more
    fair to say, if you have a gene that predisposes one to cancer, any such cancers
    should be covered by some federal health insurance. But that would involve up-front
    expenditures, extra-premiums or plans provided by the Nanny State. Legislators
    like smooshing expenses indirectly through mandates, that then drive up costs
    indirectly, and then every one can think the Government costlessly made a good
    thing happen.
