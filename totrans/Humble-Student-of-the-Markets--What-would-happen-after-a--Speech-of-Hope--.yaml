    drive. Of course, Germany owes its post-war recovery and wealth to its people
    and their hard work, innovation, and devotion to a united, democratic Europe.
    But Germans could not have staged their magnificent post-war renaissance without
    the support signified by the “Speech of Hope.”

    keen to restore hope to the defeated Germans. But once President Harry Truman’s
    administration decided to rehabilitate Germany, there was no turning back. Its
    rebirth was underway, facilitated by the Marshall Plan, the US-sponsored 1953
    debt write-down, and by the infusion of migrant labor from Italy, Yugoslavia,
    and Greece.

    Someone had to put aside moralistic objections and look dispassionately at a country
    locked in a set of circumstances that would only reproduce discord and fragmentation

    country, did precisely that.

    for success is the existence and development of industry clusters, e.g. Silicon
    Valley, which becomes a hub that spawns industry excellence, development and employment.
    Jacobs' work more or less says the same thing, except that her unit of development
    is the city-state instead of Porter`s focus on country-specific development.

    was shattered by war, 1946 Germany was endowed with a considerable amount of human
    capital. The Germans had a tradition of excellence in science and engineering
    that went back years. As an example, German companies had a technological lead
    in chemicals in the late 19th and early 20th Century. Today, companies like Bayer
    and BASF carry on that tradition of German chemistry. The Second World War was
    marked by German "wonder weapons". It was therefore not a surprise that there
    was a scramble for former German rocket scientists after the war.

    oriented. Its underlying philosophy calls for getting the right market mechanisms
    in place, e.g. cost structures, labor market reforms, the right incentives, etc.,
    and growth will naturally follow. The problem with this approach is that Greece,
    unlike countries like Ireland, has few competitive advantages. The EU mandated
    solution amounts to forced internal devaluation. It would mean that, in the example
    of textiles, that Greek wages would have to fall even further to levels that competes
    with the likes of China, Vietnam or Thailand.

    believe that it has an over-levered capital structure and could be fixed with

    needs to be remedied with better management and business rationalizations. They
