    just fallen off a cliff since Easter. I decided to compare the volume the last
    30 days to the volume of the previous 50\. The last 30 days have posted average
    daily volume less than 75% of the average of the previous 50\. I thought this
    unusual and did a study to find other times this may have occurred.

    rose 7 of ten times. There was also a general decrease in historical volatility
    8 of the 10 times. Gains were generally in line with random and 7 for 10 isn’t
    mathematically significant, so I’m not sure there’s a lot to be learned here.
    I did find it interesting that all prior instances happened between 1960 and 1980\.
    Dates are listed below:'

    that many of the occurrences happened in a generally difficult period for the
    market but returns were pretty good. For instance, the 70’s had 5 instances –
    4 of which led to higher prices over the next two months.
