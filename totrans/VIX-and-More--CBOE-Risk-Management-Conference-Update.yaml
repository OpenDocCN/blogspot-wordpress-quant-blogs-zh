    the presentations, sidebar conversations and opportunities to meet and greet,
    I have to say that things hit full stride very quickly.

- en: Today CBOE CEO Ed Tilly [announced](http://ir.cboe.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=833592)
    that the CBOE will roll out nearly 24 hours of trading, five days per week in
    [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures) beginning
    on Sunday, June 22\. This announcement follows another important [announcement](http://ir.cboe.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=832160)
    last week that options on [VXST](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXST)
    (the CBOE Short-Term Volatility Index) will commence on April 10\. Clearly, things
    continue to move forward on the volatility product front and at the end of the
    year, I suspect we will lock back on these two developments as critical milestones
    in the volatility space.

    on “New Insights into Geopolitical Risk: Examining Geopolitical Risk Hot Spots
    and the Implications for Trading Strategies and Risk Management.” For anyone wondering
    about what it might take to drive the VIX higher over the course of the next few
    years, Zonis had a laundry list of grave concerns ([Ukraine](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Ukraine),
    [Japan](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Japan)/China, Korean Peninsula,
    [Pakistan](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Pakistan), [Iran](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Iran)/[Israel](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Israel)/nuclear

    [China](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/China), political stagnation,
    etc.) and summarized the situation by saying, “We are in the age of *major*, *major*
    political risk.”'

- en: Another featured speaker was Maneesh Deshpande, who talked extensively about
    the evolution of the demand for volatility products as well as the evolution of
    the supply for volatility products. Maneesh had a number of interesting observations
    about new players and new strategies in the volatility space. He also expressed
    concern about the crowded VIX short trade and the potential for the next crisis
    that does not mean-revert quickly to lead to a sharp second [VIX spike](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20spikes)
    as shorts scramble to cover their positions.

- en: Also of interest was a two-part presentation with Dominic Salvino discussing
    VXST and other volatility index products (he expects interest in VXST futures
    will pick up dramatically after the options are launched in less than a month)
    as well as a detailed description of the VIX settlement process ([VIX SOQ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20SOQ))

    been regular readers of *VIX and More* over the years, many of whom nudged me
    to ramp up my posting frequency – which I certainly intend to do in 2014, starting
    this week.
