    still interesting.  In many ways, I’m wondering if Ontologies would aid in model/algorithm
    usage, or I end up with data overload 🙂

    an Information [Edge](http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/stratany2014/public/schedule/detail/37837)“.
     Although the slide deck isn’t full of detail, slide 5 does at least off a high
    level architecture, and provide some detail on ontology usage. Looks like the
    same presentation was delivered [again](http://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/big-data-conference-uk-2015/public/schedule/detail/39810)
    last year – unfortunately this time there isn’t any slide deck available.

    data lake in Hadoop, stored in HDFS. To represent our knowledge domains, Goldman
    Sachs has developed an enterprise ontology representing its business concepts.
    The upper ontology is represented in OWL format and describes class structures
    and data transformation rules. These rules are then leveraged in a custom-developed
    Hadoop process to transform data into semantically consistent information in RDF
    format. The assertions and higher-order concepts from the lower ontology are leveraged
    to generate the rule set on the transformed data, creating “Big Graphs” consisting
    of, in some cases, billions of nodes and edges
