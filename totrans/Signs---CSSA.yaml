- en: I am not a perma-bear, but I like to always keep an eye out for disparate facts
    that unite  together to give me an idea of risk versus reward over the intermediate
    term. All of my trading is short-term and non-discretionary, but ultimately the
    bet sizing and exposure decision is judgement based.  Several signs seem to suggest the
    possibility of another meltdown in  2010.  As always you should wait for technical
    confirmation.
