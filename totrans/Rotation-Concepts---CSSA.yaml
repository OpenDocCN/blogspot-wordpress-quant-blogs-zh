    or ETFs that either have the strongest trend or are rising the fastest. The methods
    for creating effective relative strength models are beyond the scope of this article,
    but suffice to say there are a wide variety of different types. What makes a good
    relative strength/rotational model is the ability to deliver: 1) a high return/risk-adjusted
    return 2) moderate turnover 3) capability of adapting to bear markets 4) speed
    of adaptation–this is directly related to drawdown risk. The ETF Rewind Rotation
    tool has all of these features–while a simple 52 week ROC momentum strategy clearly
    does not. Classic RS strategies all use 52-week ROC in some capacity, and the
    highest-ranked stocks have massively underperformed the lowest-ranked stocks in
    the last couple years. If you have done any due diligence or research–this should
    not have come as a surprise, however it is a highly durable abeit long-term strategy.
    A 52-week ROC strategy will have its periods of over/underperformance, but will
    persist over long periods of time due to its robustness—even more so in my opinion
    than say timing with a 200-day moving average.'

    than just a good algorithm. Rotational strategies are relative, and they depend
    on the universe of stocks/ETFs that are chosen. This is actually the most critical
    step to building a good model. Other questions pertain to how many assets (stocks/ETFs)
    you will select and how often you will rotate. What we are looking for in this
    case is to rotate across assets that have: **1) low inherent correlation**–ideally
    you will have different asset classes or sectors. A low correlation is the only
    thing that allows you to truly have a free lunch because it reduces risk substantially
    without hurting returns as much as more correlated strategies. Futhermore, even
    if you choose only one asset, a low correlation will permit near sequentially
    independent opportunities: this means that one asset can be moving higher while
    the rest are falling or consolidating- potentially allowing you to surf new waves
    all the time. This technique is impossible to accomplish with an inherently correlated
    asset universe such as 5 stocks within the same sector. Another important feature
    of your selection criterion for rotation models are assets with **2) inherently
    good potential reward/volatility** which is often found by using an index ETF,
    or commmodity or large capitalization stocks—anything else requires tremendous
    diversification to be effective. The issue with small stocks for example is earnings
    or news risk which can cause a stock to tank 40-50% in one day, or rise several
    hundred percent. Their high idiosyncratic risk makes them a very risky proposition—but
    even more importantly they have very high trend failure rates: small stocks do
    not tend to hold their trends as long as large stocks (in turn these are inferior
    to sectors, which are inferior to indexes, and asset classes etc). This increases
    turnover in rotational models, and also makes it difficult for the algorithm chosen
    to determine when to switch.'

    algorithms that were longer-term over this brutal bear market. However in an absolute
    sense, the returns are still quite low–reflecting the fact that there was nowhere
    to rotate to when the market went down. The indexes are too highly correlated
    to use on a standalone basis. So what about “international diversification” ie
    the overblown concept most often touted by ill-informed or complacent financial
    advisors? Lets take a look–here I will add EEM- the emerging markets ETF which
    covers the BRIC countries and many more and EFA- which covers the MSCI EAFE index
    (Europe, Asia and the Far East). Although there is some overlap, these two are
    the biggies that pretty much cover the rest of the world. Again in this test we
    will rotate to the top index.

    a material difference. After all the correlations between the indexes are quite
    high, and especially so in bear markets (note that in bull markets this differential
    would be much larger). Lets now add some real diversifiers– bonds and short-term
    bonds/cash. For bonds we will use AGG- Lehman Aggregate Bond Index , and for a
    cash proxy we will use SHY which is the 1-3 year Barclays treasury bond index.

    nothing to sneeze at, especially with a Sharpe Ratio of .61\. As you can clearly
    see, the ability to rotate to uncorrelated assets was a major help, and sort of
    a market timing tool. Any rotation model MUST have bonds or cash—and preferably
    a cash proxy like SHY since it has much less downside. Forget about all of the
    silly anecdotes about raising cash in bear markets etc–that is far too vague.
    Using the REWIND rotation model its quite simple–if cash is number 1 its time
    to get the #$&% out of the market. I can imagine sophisticated readers may have
    been rolling their eyes at the talk of diversification etc, but truthfully in
    reference to relative strength many MBAs,CFAs and PhD’s fail to put cash/bonds
    in their rotational models (including yours truly in earlier iterations many moons
    ago).'
