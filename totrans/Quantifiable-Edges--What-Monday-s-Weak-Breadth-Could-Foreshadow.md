# Quantifiable Edges: What Monday's Weak Breadth Could Foreshadow

> 来源：[http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2013/05/what-mondays-weak-breadth-could.html#0001-01-01](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2013/05/what-mondays-weak-breadth-could.html#0001-01-01)

Monday’s weak breadth could imply negative ramifications over the next few days.  In the past I looked at instances where the SPX closed higher while the NYSE Up Issues % came in under 40%. Results above the 200ma showed a steady and persistent downside edge. I have updated them below.

The numbers here appear to suggest a downside edge.  Perhaps the market is readying to lay off the gas for a day or two.
