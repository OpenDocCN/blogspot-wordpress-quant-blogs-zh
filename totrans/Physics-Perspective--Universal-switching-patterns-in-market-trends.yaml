    in time. The statistics of market fluctuations over a short time, if stretched
    out in time and rescaled in value, look identical to fluctuations over longer
    times. What's happening over seconds is somehow intimately linked up with what's
    happening over hours, days or months.

    appreciation of the likelihood of sudden large fluctuations in any system with
    fluctuations of this sort. Now everyone knows about Black Swans and fat tails,

    ups and downs.

    quite important as it hints at some deep regularities in the way markets switch
    between upward and downward trends over a huge range of timescales from seconds
    up to years. Indeed, it suggests that some very fundamental collective pattern
    of human decision making -- as individuals sense the shifting views of others
    and become more likely to act in the same way -- lie behind many market rallies
    and crashes, regardless of the timescale on which they play out.

- en: Briefly, what Preis and colleagues have done is to analyze several different
    data sets for price movements in markets on times ranging from 10 milliseconds
    (high frequency trading in futures markets) up to around 10 billion milliseconds,
    or several decades (the S&P Stock Market Index over a 40 year period). Their analysis
    focuses on what they refer to as "switching events" -- an upward trend which breaks
    off into a negative one, or vice versa. These can be identified (or defined) in
    a mathematically unambiguous way. Focus your microscope in on a timescale of duration
    Δt. The price is bouncing up and down, with p(t) giving the value versus time.
    The researchers then define p(t) to be ...

    are taken as potential switching points - moments at which the market moved from
    a trend in one direction to another. They go on to study the volume of individual
    trades in the market record as you move closer to or further away from these switching
    points. The payoff is that they find essentially the same mathematical pattern
    across all time scales, even when moving between the futures market and the stock
    market -- in effect, a signature of switching points that shows up in the volume
    of trades and predicts approaching changes.

    even better in the diagram below. It shows how the volume of individual trades
    increases as the moment of a switching point approaches. Remember, this isn''t
    just at one timescale, but is averaged over many timescales (this figure is for
    data at shorter times taken from a futures market):'

- en: I apologize for the resolution, but you can see the basic point -- the middle
    of the diagram is the moment of a switching point, and the volume per trade as
    one approaches this point becomes very large. That is, people start trading in
    larger and larger amounts as you approach these points. They do so before the
    switch actually happens. So their behaviour is, in effect, an early warning sign
    of an impending switch in the trend.

- en: This is a highly provocative finding. The paper also explores some models inspired
    from physics which might explain how such a universal pattern can occur. In essence,
    the kinds of models that work reflect the avalanche behaviour as the actions of
    some people feed into and influence the actions of others. On any timescale, the
    same kind of dynamic may be at work -- many people follow a trend for a time,
    then, a few become wary of a reversal and act accordingly. Others begin sensing
    those peoples' actions and follow suit. A growing avalanche of behaviour reverses
    the trend -- and simultaneously launches one off in the opposite direction.

- en: In summary, we have seen that each trend—microtrend and macrotrend—in a financial
    market starts and ends with a unique switching process, and each extremum shares
    properties of macroscopic cooperative behavior. We have seen that the switching
    mechanism has no scale, for time scales varying over nine orders of magnitude
    down to the smallest possible time scale —the scale of single transactions measured
    in units of 10 ms. Thus, the well known catastrophic bubbles occurring on large
    time scales—such as the most recent financial crisis—may not be outliers but in
    fact single dramatic events caused by the inherent, scale-free behavior related
    to the formation of increasing and decreasing trends on time scales from the very
    large down to the very small.

    by Mandelbrot's discoveries of 50 years ago, but also going well beyond.
