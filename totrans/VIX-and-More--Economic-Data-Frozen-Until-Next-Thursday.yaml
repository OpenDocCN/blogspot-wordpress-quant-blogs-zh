- en: Today’s data dump of [nonfarm payrolls](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/nonfarm%20payrolls),
    the ISM non-manufacturing survey and factory orders caps a big week for economic
    data and since there is an unusually long stretch until the next data points are
    released ( next Thursday’s jobless claims), this seems like a good time to update
    my ongoing chart of economic data relative to expectations.

    been a noticeable uptick in positive reports since the beginning of September
    – one that just so happens to coincide with the upturn in stocks.” Today’s nonfarm
    payrolls report notwithstanding, the pattern of positive surprises has been repeated
    through November and into the first week of December. While employment continues
    to be the biggest story, the recent uptrend in the consumer and resurgence in
    manufacturing mitigates some of the bad news on the labor front and hints at the
    possibility of a job market that may show signs of improvement soon.

    market seem, the data has consistently been coming in higher than the lowered
    consensus expectations.

    period of time. Among other things, this lack of new data points means that any
    investing trends that are currently in place will have little in the way of evidence
    to undermine their validity during the next week. It also means that the Fed will
    have little in the way of additional new information in front of them when the
    FOMC meets on Tuesday, December 14^(th).
