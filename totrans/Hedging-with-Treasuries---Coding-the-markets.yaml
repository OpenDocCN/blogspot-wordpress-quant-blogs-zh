    review](http://accruedint.blogspot.com/2007/04/too-many-trades.html) of why bond
    fund managers – “real money” in dealer jargon – trade so much. Very illuminating,
    especially since I work for a Euro govy (EGB) dealer. I particularly enjoyed the
    explanation at the end of the use of credit spread trading to lock in profits,
    whatever happens in the Treasury market. It reminded me of some figures that I
    saw in [Avinash Persaud](http://www-cfap.jbs.cam.ac.uk/peopledetail.php?id=25)‘s
    [paper](http://www.icap.com/pdf/ICAP_Brussels_Nov2006.pdf) on the recently much
    discussed MTS “monopoly”. Table 2 in that paper shows daily turnover in govies
    by country for March 2006\. Euro zone countries have turnover ranging from 1.2%
    of outstanding daily (FR,DE) to 10.7% (IT) and 13.3% (PT). The US daily turnover
    was 138.9%. I was initially startled by that figure til I remembered someone mentioning
    to me how heavily Treasuries are used for hedging in US markets. So thanks to
    Accrued for giving such a great example of that hedging.

    he takes the opposite position in the relevant EurexFutures contracts – Schatz
    (2Y), Bobl (5Y), Bund (10Y) or Buxl (30Y). The contracts are highly liquid, net
    supply isn’t constrained, and capital requirements are low: it’s a contract, not
    a cash instrument, so a trader only needs to post margin on big moves.'

    guessing there’s no Treasury futures market that would support cheaper hedging.
    If so, why not ?  Shouldn’t CME be doing this ?
