    man formations are thought of as bearish reversals, further studies showed that
    they don't necessarily resolve themselves in a bearish fashion unless there is
    a bearish follow-through the next day.

    man, but the market astonishingly closed in the red to flash a bearish confirmation.
    My own historical study indicates that these episodes tend to be short-term bearish,
    and bottom out between day 3 and 4, which translates to either this Thursday or
    Friday.
