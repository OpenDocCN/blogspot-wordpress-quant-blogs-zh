- en: There is probably a better word out there to describe the recent lack of action
    in the VIX, but I’m going to stick with ‘meander’ for now.  After weekly changes
    of 9% or more in one direction or the other for 11 out of the past 12 weeks, the
    VIX dropped a mere 0.26 (1.1%) last week to end the week at 23.68.  Perhaps more
    important, in spite of those 12 relatively volatile weeks, last week’s close leaves
    the VIX just 0.10 above the 50 day SMA, indicating that this has been a lot of
    running hard simply to stay in the same place.

    is as unimpressed by the recent market downturn as the VIX, currently registering
    a zero, which indicates no bias toward increasing volatility.
