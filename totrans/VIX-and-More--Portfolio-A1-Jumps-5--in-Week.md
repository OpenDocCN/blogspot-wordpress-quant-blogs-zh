# VIX and More: Portfolio A1 Jumps 5% in Week

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/10/portfolio-a1-jumps-5-in-week.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/10/portfolio-a1-jumps-5-in-week.html#0001-01-01)

As the equity curve below shows, the August plunge has largely been eradicated in September, thanks in part to an impressive 5% gain in the portfolio last week.  The strong week puts Portfolio A1’s cumulative return back into the plus column, with gains since the February 16^(th) inception now at 1.8%.  While this performance continues to trail the 4.9% gain registered by the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period, an optimist might venture a small smile for the first time in about two months.

One unusual aspect to last week’s gains is the decision by the stock ranking system to drop [DryShips (DRYS)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=drys&hl=en) after a stunning 27% gain in just four weeks in the portfolio.  This is the first time the portfolio has dropped a double digit gainer and it is a little bit of a head scratcher, but perhaps the stock ranker has turned [HAL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAL_9000) on me taken up to reading Investor’s Business Daily, specifically a Friday article titled [Smiling Dry-Bulk Shippers See The Boom Times Lasting For Years](http://biz.yahoo.com/ibd/070928/newamer.html?.v=1).

To replace DryShips, the portfolio has decided to dive headlong into <country-region st="on"><place st="on">China</place></country-region> by picking up [Shanda Interactive (SNDA)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=snda&hl=en), the Shanghai-based interactive entertainment company. In my discretionary trading I am short <country-region st="on"><place st="on">China</place></country-region> stocks at the moment, so this portfolio may provide yet another interesting competition between man and machine.

There are no other changes to the portfolio this week.

A snapshot of the portfolio is as follows:
