    market capitalization, you weight it by some fundamental measure (e.g. sales,
    book value, etc.). In practice, fundamental indices are weighted by a combination
    of fundamental factors, rather than a single factor, in order to increase stability.

- en: There is an important difference between cap weighted indices and fundamentally
    weighted indices. Cap weighted indices are far more passive. In the absence of
    membership changes and changes in shares outstanding because of buybacks or new
    issues, a cap weighted index portfolio requires no trading or portfolio rebalancing,
    other than the periodic re-investment of dividends.

    As stock prices move over time, the actual weight in a fundamentally weighted
    portfolio will deviate from the target fundamental weight. In practice, the rebalancing
    occurs annually.

    because Japan was such a large weight in the cap-weighted EAFE index. Virtually
    no manager was at cap weight in the EAFE portfolio because it would leave the
    portfolio with too much country specific risk. In practice, problems occurred
    on an annual basis when MSCI rebalanced the GDP-weighted EAFE index to its GDP
    weight. Japan’s weight in the index would typically move overnight by 5-10%. Such
    huge swings in the benchmark made it very difficult for an active, never mind
    passive, manager to run the portfolio.

    rest of the world knows what you have to do – and you have to do it despite that
    knowledge. This foreknowledge exacerbated the effects of the market crash of 1987
    as market makers knew the portfolio insurers/program traders needed to sell more
    stocks as the market moved down. It also played a part in the sinking of Long
    Term Capital Management. The Street knew LTCM’s book. They knew the firm was in
    trouble. Arbs were front-running the firm’s positions, which worsened their losses.

    traders can estimate the amount of rebalancing that will need to be done by the
    fundamental indexers – and front run them. This form of front running is not illegal,
    just smart trading, and it will serve to reduce the returns to fundamental indexing.

    is a game of inches. As fundamental indexing becomes more popular, rebalancing
    and implementation costs could easily take away any gains from the underlying
    investment concept.
