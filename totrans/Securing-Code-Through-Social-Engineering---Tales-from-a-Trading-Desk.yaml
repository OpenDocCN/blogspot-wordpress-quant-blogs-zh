    from QCon on “Securing Code Through Social Engineering”.  Christina provides a
    few real world stories around social engineering (7mins) – password reset over
    the phone.  Secure code has improved over the years due to publicity of issues
    from large companies like Microsoft and Adobe, and also thanks to the [checklists](https://www.owasp.org),
    libraries, frameworks and books written about secure software engineering.  However,
    social engineering can bypass all of these code improvements.
