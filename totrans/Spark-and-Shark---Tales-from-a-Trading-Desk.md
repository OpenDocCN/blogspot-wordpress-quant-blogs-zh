## Spark and Shark

Over the last few months there has been a few articles on [Spark](http://spark-project.org/).  The interesting thing about Spark is that its bias to in-memory.  IBM developerWorks has an article on Spark data analytics, “[Spark, an alternative for fast data analytics](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/os-spark/)“, which provides some insight into Spark.  Of interest is that Spark is implemented in Scala.  Amazon provides support for Spark, Shark and Mesos – see details [here](http://aws.amazon.com/articles/4926593393724923).

One can see the advantages of Spark, and thus I’m curious if anyone in financial services has tired leveraging Spark for possible risk management…
