- en: The U. S. government’s failure to provide oversight and prudent regulation of
    the financial markets, together with excessive risk taking by some financial institutions,
    pushed the world financial system to the brink of systemic failure in 2008\. As
    a consequence of this near catastrophe, both regulators and investors have become
    keenly interested in developing tools for monitoring systemic risk. But this is
    easier said than done. Securitization, private transacting, and “flexible” accounting
    prevent us from directly observing the many explicit linkages of financial institutions.
    As an alternative, we introduce a measure of implied systemic risk called the
    absorption ratio, which equals the fraction of the total variance of a set of
    asset returns explained or “absorbed” by a fixed number of eigenvectors. The absorption
    ratio captures the extent to which markets are unified or tightly coupled. When
    markets are tightly coupled, they become more fragile in the sense that negative
    shocks propagate more quickly and broadly than when markets are loosely linked.
