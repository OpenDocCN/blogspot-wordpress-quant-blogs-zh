    in our attempt to [forecast the VIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/volatility%20forecast)
    one month out, I have been slow to warm up to the predictive value of the VIX
    looking out more than a month or two – all of which makes Eric Boughton’s “[The
    Predictive Value of the VIX: Room for Divergent Opinions](http://usmarket.seekingalpha.com/article/45014)”
    particularly interesting reading.'

    is not likely to give you any aggregate useful information about whether returns
    will be high or low over the next year.”  The good news is that the VIX does a
    reasonably good job of predicting future volatility over the course of the next
    12 months.'

    the predictive value of the VIX, the tidbit I found most interesting was tucked
    away at the bottom of Boughton’s article, in which he notes that “buying the S&P
    on every day the VIX exceeded 30, and holding it for a year, resulted in an average
    return of 17.15% (as compared to the average return of 10.28% available for all
    twelve-month periods during the period in question).”  His conclusion?  Even if
    there is no correlation between the VIX and one year returns, “the market seems
    to pay an outsized return in exchange for the risk of buying when fear is high.”

    worth talking about.  In the end, it is VIX spikes and mean reversion that matter
    most – and those factors are easiest to predict over the course of about 5-10
    trading days.
