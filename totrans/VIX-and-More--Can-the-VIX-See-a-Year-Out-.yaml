    in our attempt to [forecast the VIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/volatility%20forecast)
    one month out, I have been slow to warm up to the predictive value of the VIX
    looking out more than a month or two – all of which makes Eric Boughton’s “[The
    Predictive Value of the VIX: Room for Divergent Opinions](http://usmarket.seekingalpha.com/article/45014)”
    particularly interesting reading.'

  zh: 即使在我和Adam Warner在尝试预测VIX一个月后的表现时还未曾[受挫](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/07/volatility-aces-bloggers.html)，我一直对VIX超过一个月或两个月后的预测价值持保留态度——这一切使得Eric
    Boughton的“[VIX的预测价值：存在不同的观点空间](http://usmarket.seekingalpha.com/article/45014)”变得特别有趣。
- en: 'First, the bad news: Boughton concludes that “knowing what the VIX is today
    is not likely to give you any aggregate useful information about whether returns
    will be high or low over the next year.”  The good news is that the VIX does a
    reasonably good job of predicting future volatility over the course of the next
    12 months.'

  zh: 首先，坏消息是：Boughton得出结论，“知道VIX今天是多少不太可能给你任何关于下一年度回报将是高还是低的综合有用的信息。”好消息是VIX在接下来12个月内对未来波动性的预测做得相当不错。
- en: While Boughton’s target time frame of one year may not be the best way to test
    the predictive value of the VIX, the tidbit I found most interesting was tucked
    away at the bottom of Boughton’s article, in which he notes that “buying the S&P
    on every day the VIX exceeded 30, and holding it for a year, resulted in an average
    return of 17.15% (as compared to the average return of 10.28% available for all
    twelve-month periods during the period in question).”  His conclusion?  Even if
    there is no correlation between the VIX and one year returns, “the market seems
    to pay an outsized return in exchange for the risk of buying when fear is high.”

  zh: 虽然Boughton一年的目标时间框架可能不是测试VIX预测价值的最佳方式，但我最感兴趣的细节是他文章末尾提到的，他指出“在VIX超过30的每一天购买标普500，并持有一年，平均收益率为17.15%（与所涉期间所有十二个月期间可获得的平均收益率10.28%相比）。”他的结论是即使VIX与一年后的回报之间没有相关性，“市场似乎为在恐惧高涨时买入的风险支付了过高的回报。”
- en: My thinking continues to be that middling values in the VIX are generally not
    worth talking about.  In the end, it is VIX spikes and mean reversion that matter
    most – and those factors are easiest to predict over the course of about 5-10
    trading days.

  zh: 我的看法一直是我认为VIX的中等值通常不值得讨论。最后，最重要的是VIX的剧变和均值回归——这些因素在接下来的5-10个交易日内最容易预测。
