## Apache Spark streaming with Apache Kafka

Interesting slide [deck](http://www.slideshare.net/doriwaldman/spark-streaming-with-kafka) on the topic of Spark and [Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/).  Three architectures are discussed with pros and cons:

*   Receiver Approach
*   Direct
*   Stateful Spark Streaming

Interested in anyone who has experience of the three architectures
