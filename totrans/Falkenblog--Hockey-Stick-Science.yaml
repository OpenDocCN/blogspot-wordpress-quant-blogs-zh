    because it was fascinating). The main issues are not abstruse statistics, but
    rather detailed, parochial empirical issues.

    historical fluctuations. As the medieval warming period when Vikings settled Greenland
    was obviously very warm, at least in Greenland, one might think that current temps
    are not that alarming. Thus, in 1998, when Michael E. Mann, Bradley and Hughes
    published a paper documenting that current temperatures are many standard deviations
    of their average since at least 1000 AD, it became the signature graph for the
    Global Warming Community.

    used to estimate temperature prior to 1880\. As the 20th century temperature increase
    that has everyone worried is only 0.6 degree centigrade, one needs some serious
    precision to claim that temperatures in the past 1000 years did not vary above
    this level. There's no fundamental law that related tree rings or oxygen isotopes
    to temperature, these things just have an imprecise theory and some empirical
    support, but it's not calibrated like some calorimeter. To think you can know
    the temperature in 1100 with the kind of accuracy that Mann et al present is really
    absurd.

    all with different results (over 400 of them). Mann et al eventually used 112
    (or 159) of them for their paper, which allows for a lot of cherry picking. Further,
    some series are truncated, some extrapolated, using seemingly innocuous phrases
    like "if records terminate slightly before the 1980 training interval, they are
    extended by persistence". That's one bizarre way to treat missing data. They also
    extrapolated certain time series that did not start or end at convenient times,
    all with a bias towards their end ('We have to get rid of the Medieval Warm Period'
    said one infamous email).

    that highlights how real science is done. You have two sides with pretty strong
    end-views--global warming is unprecedented, or not--and while both claim to simply
    be interested in the objective truth, after 10+ years invested in one conclusion
    it defies credulity to think a researcher can address this question objectively
    any more. Basically, we have two sets of partisan scientists presenting their
    case, like paid lawyers.

    a financial economist rigging his backtest, this may generate a publication but
    in the long run the data are what they are, and its best to have the facts on
    your side because eventually the facts win. Very few are committing conscious
    fraud, but rather, fraud of the more common sort, that of where a seemingly innocuous
    inaccuracy saves tons of explanation in their mind.

    from time to time that nothing that is worth knowing can be taught. Big debates
    are usually not centered on not singular facts or theories, but their many observations,
    knowing which are relevant, which are not. Knowing how to weight correctly is
    mainly an exercise in meticulous research and wisdom, and it especially helps
    to have correct or at least popular
