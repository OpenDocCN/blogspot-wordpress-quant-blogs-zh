    to eat food that makes them unhealthy.

    in countries where the "poor" have a standard of living that billions of people
    in Africa and Asia can only dream of. "Poor" has become a meaningless term these
    days, since it is applied applied as a category on an ordinal scale, not as a
    value below a threshold on a ratio scale.'

- en: 'Anonymous@6:26pm: Answer: false dichotomy. The answer I would give for myself
    is: statement of fact - or do you disagree that the teens were black? Stereotyping,
    aka categorization, is how the human brain operates. It is an absolute requirement
    for higher-level thought processes. When you see two objects, you (and that includes
    YOU as well) go through a categorization process - are the objects alive? are
    they mammals? are they human beings? is it male? etc. The (subconscious) purpose
    is to find similarities and thus establish possible connections. What is so objectionable
    to you about an exhaustive list of the similarities between two people? American,
    black, teen, and poor (starting condition) appears to exhaust the common similarities
    between the two characters. And very few - I am sure not our host - deny the relative
    poverty of black Americans? So? Your point? Are black Americans required by some
    divine law to be as wealthy as other Americans?'

    budget. Teenagers are already very successful at eating their way through their
    parents wallets, with their bottomless pits, but a pair at 700 lbs takes the cake!

    not make it relevant or useful. The third letter of your "name" is "A" - fact

- en: You're wrong in that the elements you cite are exhaustive. Nobody pointed out
    whether they are male or female; jewish, moslem or Christian; rural or urban;
    only children or siblings etc. etc. etc. What added value is there in their black
    categorization? If their colour had not been mentioned what value would have been
    lost?

- en: On your prior point. Why is poverty or anything else meaningless if ordinal?
    Do you REALLY believe there is an absolute value that determines who is rich &
    poor? Surely poverty always has a relative dimension. You are poor if you cannot
    afford the cost of survival (which is relative to the cost of living in the society
    in which you find yourself) & you are poor(er) if you can access less than others
    in your society.

    so warrant going to an ivy league university? If so is that not an ordinal distinction?
    Or, do you believe that JFK, George W Bush & Barack Obama rank equally in absolute
    terms with Harvard's 50 Nobel laureates?

    poor people aren't starving to death.
