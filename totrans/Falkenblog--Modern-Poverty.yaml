- en: 'Anonymous@6:26pm: Answer: false dichotomy. The answer I would give for myself
    is: statement of fact - or do you disagree that the teens were black? Stereotyping,
    aka categorization, is how the human brain operates. It is an absolute requirement
    for higher-level thought processes. When you see two objects, you (and that includes
    YOU as well) go through a categorization process - are the objects alive? are
    they mammals? are they human beings? is it male? etc. The (subconscious) purpose
    is to find similarities and thus establish possible connections. What is so objectionable
    to you about an exhaustive list of the similarities between two people? American,
    black, teen, and poor (starting condition) appears to exhaust the common similarities
    between the two characters. And very few - I am sure not our host - deny the relative
    poverty of black Americans? So? Your point? Are black Americans required by some
    divine law to be as wealthy as other Americans?'

  zh: '匿名@下午6:26: 答案：伪二分法。我会给出我的回答：事实陈述——你不同意青少年是黑人吗？模式化，也就是分类，是人脑的运作方式。它是更高级思维过程的绝对要求。当你看到两个物体时，你（这也包括你自己）会经历一个分类过程——这些物体是活的吗？它们是哺乳动物吗？它们是人吗？是男性吗？等等。这（潜意识的）目的是找到相似之处，从而建立可能的联系。你对于两个人的相似之处的详尽列表有什么异议？美国人、黑人、青少年和贫困（起始条件）似乎枚举了这两个人之间的共同相似之处。而很少有人——我相信不包括我们的主持人在内——否认了美国黑人的相对贫困？所以？你的观点是？黑人美国人有必须像其他美国人一样富有吗？'

  zh: 只有在添加价值时分类才是有用的。一个类别是一个事实并不意味着它是相关或有用的。你的“名字”的第三个字母是“A”——事实——那又怎样？
- en: You're wrong in that the elements you cite are exhaustive. Nobody pointed out
    whether they are male or female; jewish, moslem or Christian; rural or urban;
    only children or siblings etc. etc. etc. What added value is there in their black
    categorization? If their colour had not been mentioned what value would have been

  zh: 你在你列举的要素上是错的。没人指出他们是男性还是女性；犹太人、穆斯林还是基督徒；农村还是城市；孩子还是兄弟姐妹等等等等。他们的黑人分类有什么附加价值呢？如果他们的肤色没有被提及，将会失去什么价值？
- en: On your prior point. Why is poverty or anything else meaningless if ordinal?
    Do you REALLY believe there is an absolute value that determines who is rich &
    poor? Surely poverty always has a relative dimension. You are poor if you cannot
    afford the cost of survival (which is relative to the cost of living in the society
    in which you find yourself) & you are poor(er) if you can access less than others
    in your society.

  zh: 在你之前的观点上。如果是顺序的，为什么贫困或其他任何事情都是毫无意义的？你真的相信有一个绝对价值来决定谁是富有和贫穷吗？毫无疑问，贫困总是有一个相对的维度。如果你支付不起生存成本（这是相对于所处社会的生活成本的），你就是穷人，如果你比其他人访问的资源更少，则你是更加贫穷的。
