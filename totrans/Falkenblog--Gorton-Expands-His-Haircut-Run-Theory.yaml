    Repo collateral went up severely in the financial crisis, and may be the essence
    of how this crisis accelerated. He has two papers that expand this idea, and the
    data underlying it. I think he makes an excellent point, and like how he clarifies
    his position, even at the risk of repeating himself.'

- en: ', Gorton and colleague Andrew Metrick (great economist name) go over the basic
    idea of how repo haircuts relate to a bank run. He notes the crisis starts in
    July 2007, just when several AAA ABX-HE (subprime housing) tranches started trading
    below par.'

    default rates, because anytime a large AAA CDO trades below par, you basically
    have a catastrophe alert. Given that even today commenters do not agree on what
    was wrong, the failure of informationally insensitive assets caused every informationally
    insensitive asset to trade as if a junk bond. That is, the problem could have
    been merely poor underwriting, but it could have been due to something else: Fed
    policy (Taylor), excessive confidence in models (Taleb), CDO assumptions (Felix
    Salmon), everything (Roubini), hubris (Tett), h government (Woods), and bubbles
    (Shiller).'

    prominence of these hypotheses they are concerns reflected in the general investing
    public. I sense that many investors changed from taking any AAA rated securities
    as a given, to going over all the things that could go wrong, which using the
    minimax principle generates really low prices.

    and through the mechanism described by Gorton, a reduction in the monetary base
    similar to if customers withdrew deposits. A modern bank run via repo haircuts
    rising.
