    dice up risk, so that higher risk firms have higher expected returns (and thus,
    higher discount rates or costs of capital). But his preferred approach is bottom
    up betas and they involve many different assumptions. He outlines several methods,
    including one that takes the percent of revenues from various countries and sectors
    (consulting vs. software), and applies separate risk premiums based on these exposures.
    You can map these exposures into regions, which can have their risk premium derived
    from Moody's rating for government debt, and their implied currency-specific risk
    free rates. You can also use the relative aggregate volatility in that country
    and the equity premium implied by the currency's libor premium to the dollar.

    vs. 软件）收入占比，并根据这些风险进行单独的风险溢价。您可以将这些风险映射到地区，这些地区的风险溢价可以根据Moody's对政府债务的评级来确定，并且可以根据其隐含的货币特定的无风险利率来确定。您还可以使用该国的相对总体波动性以及相对于美元的货币利率溢价来确定权益溢价。

    companies have a higher risk than diversified companies, manufacturing companies
    higher risk than service companies, companies that use futures to hedge their

- en: These all seem reasonable, but there's no empirical evidence that such distinctions
    show up in actual returns, in fact, most of his examples go the other way. Sure
    they all seem plausible, indeed, given an economist’s assumptions on the utility
    function—that utility is increasing in wealth at a decreasing rate—this is both
    a necessary and sufficient reason for there to be a risk premium, so presumably
    just construct an intuitive risk metric and expect higher returns. Alas, the risk
    premium does not appear. It’s simply not true that growth outperforms value, or
    certain stock sectors have higher returns, even countries do not have obviously
    higher returns, or that more volatile stocks have higher returns than low volatility
    stocks. A beautiful theory killed by data, it happens all the time.

  zh: 这些都看起来合理，但实际收益中并没有经验证据表明这种区别存在，事实上，他的大多数例子都是相反的。当然，它们都似乎是合理的，实际上，鉴于经济学家对效用函数的假设——效用随着财富的增加而以递减的速度增加——这既是风险溢价存在的必要条件，也是充分条件，因此只需构建一个直观的风险度量，并期望更高的收益。然而，风险溢价并未出现。增长并非总是胜过价值，或者某些股票部门的收益更高，甚至国家的收益也并不明显更高，或者更具波动性的股票的收益比低波动性股票的收益更高，这都是不正确的。一个美丽的理论被数据击败，这种情况经常发生。

- en: At one point, Damodaran notes Warren Buffett's use of simple Treasuries for
    discount rates, seemingly making his bottom-up betas a huge waste of time, but
    you had to figure he's got an answer for that. He says that when the Oracle of
    Omaha projects cash flows, he calculates 'certainty equivalent' cash flows. Now,
    I know Buffett tries to be conservative, and has a 'margin of safety' in his hurdle
    rates, but I really doubt he generates 'certainty equivalent cashflows' in the
    academic sense. Such cash flows are not adjusted for imprecision, or volatility,
    but rather correlation with something like the S&P500 or GDP. Then, the adjustment
    is a linear function of this covariance. To say that's what Buffett is doing by
    making conservative cash flow assumptions, implicitly, is one of those assertions
    that seems plausible, but under scrutiny absurd.

  zh: 在某个时候，达摩达兰指出了沃伦·巴菲特使用简单的国债作为折现率，看起来使他的自下而上的贝塔成为一种巨大的时间浪费，但你得想到他对此有答案。他说，当奥马哈的神谕者预测现金流时，他计算的是“确定性等价”的现金流。现在，我知道巴菲特试图保守，并且在他的障碍利率中有一个“安全边际”，但我真的怀疑他是否像学术意义上那样生成“确定性等价现金流”。这样的现金流不会调整不确定性或波动性，而是与像
    S&P500 或 GDP 这样的东西的相关性。然后，调整是与这个协方差的线性函数相关的。暗示巴菲特通过做保守的现金流假设来做这件事，实际上是一个看似合理但经不起审查的断言。

    that a noob can’t understand each little step in his algorithm. I love the idea
    of taking a company like SAP, with years of history, and instead of using the
    obviously irrelevant top-down beta, use a less irrelevant-seeming 'bottom up'
    beta by separating the revenues by continent and then into consulting and software.
    As a consultant whose main input is the discount rate, if he merely applied the
    beta taken from regressions of the stock price it wouldn't seem worth $50k. Going
    over all the bottom up logic requires lots of face time with senior execs, something

    50,000 美元。审查所有自下而上的逻辑需要与高级执行人员面对面的时间，这是顾问和缺乏安全感的高管都喜欢的事情。

    more accurate forward covariances with the aggregate market or better predicts

    It's typical consulting, in that the process allows the consultant to give the
    answer a particular firm-insider want, all with the pretense of rigor and objective
    analysis. It's hardly more scientific than astrology in its actual implementation,
    even though its filled with many reasonable assumptions and interpolations. I
