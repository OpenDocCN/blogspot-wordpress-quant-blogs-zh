    stocks within the index were more likely to be the “drivers” of index returns
    than others. Different variables such as volume activity and others may be able
    to help separate which stocks were useful for predicting index returns versus
    those that were not. The only way to really tell if such a ranking has any power
    is to do a “walk-forward” test in which stocks are selected each day as “predictors”
    of the QQQQ by use of the DV2 indicator. **Effectively a signal is created from
    this group to trade the QQQQ**. As it turns out, the methodology appears quite
    powerful–a near linear increase in absolute and risk-adjusted returns by rank.
    Using the Top 10 stocks to create an adaptive breadth index (averaging the dv2
    values of the top stocks) to trade long .5 significantly outperformed using the
    DV2 on the QQQQ alone (the benchmark). Unlike standard breadth indicators where
    theories and fables abound concerning how to best apply them, this method is more
    “assumption free.” As **Jeff Pietsch** of **Market Rewind** likes to say: “Markov
    would be proud!”'
