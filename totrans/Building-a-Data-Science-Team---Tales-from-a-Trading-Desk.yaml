    scientists to “write up analyses from start to finish” – effectively a blog of
    research.  I would assume this comes with a fully repeatable way of anyone in
    Airbnb taking the research and branching down other roads, offering easy Return
    on Investment (ROI).  In many ways similar to Kaggle [Kernels](https://www.kaggle.com/kernels)
    and [Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets).  Some details of the Airbnb sharing
    knowledge pipeline are discussed [here](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/scaling-knowledge-at-airbnb-875d73eff091#.ijfg1r5ik).
