# VIX and More: A Dozen Things My Trading Accounts Are Thankful For This Year

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/11/ten-things-my-trading-accounts-are.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/11/ten-things-my-trading-accounts-are.html#0001-01-01)

I am a strong proponent of taking stock of what is working and what is not working on a regular basis.

That being said, if my trading accounts could speak, these are some things they would be thankful for so far in 2007:

1.  More active use of trailing stops (probably the #1 reason for increased trading success in the past few years)
2.  Increased use of the VIX (and [VWSI](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VWSI)) to aid in timing the market
3.  Emphasis on put to call ratios (especially the [ISEE](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/ISEE)) to evaluate market sentiment
4.  Lack of hesitation in initiating [short selling](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/short%20selling) positions (the end of a long bias approach)
5.  Blogging – and all the cross-pollination of ideas that it has engendered
6.  ETFs – to diversify, go short, apply leverage, etc.
7.  More time stops (including hybrid price/time stops such as a Parabolic [SAR](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SAR))

8.  Better strategies for taking partial profits in options positions

9.  Following the [China](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/China) trend, whichever direction it takes me
10.  Iron [condors](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/condor) and other strategies to capture premium associated with high volatility and/or non-trending securities
11.  Numerous enhancements to a detailed and continuously evolving spreadsheet I use to track and analyze all my trades
12.  Standardization on a single momentum indicator for my charts: [Williams %R](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Williams%20%25R)
