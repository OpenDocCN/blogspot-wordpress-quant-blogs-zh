- en: Back in December 2008, in [VIX Trends Around FOMC Announcement Days](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/12/vix-trends-around-fomc-announcement.html),
    I posted a chart of the average movements in the VIX in the ten trading day leading
    up to and following “[Fed Days](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Fed%20Days),”
    otherwise known as days in which the Federal Open Market Committee ([FOMC](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/FOMC))
    makes its policy statement announcement. Several long-time readers who recall
    that chart – and an earlier incarnation from [VIX Price Movement Around FOMC Meetings](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/01/vix-price-movement-around-fomc-meetings.html)
    – have recently asked for an updated version. With all eyes on the Fed’s statement
    and Ben Bernanke’s press conference on Wednesday, this seems like a good time
    to revisit how the VIX moves in the days leading up to and following FOMC announcements.

    easy to compare the mean daily changes in the VIX in the ten trading days preceding
    FOMC policy statement announcements as well as ten trading days following those
    announcements. The quick takeaway is that the data from the last five years has
    been consistent with the data as of 2008\. There are still three dominant features
    in this chart:'

    has been steeper during the three days prior to the announcement and more gradual
    in the week or so prior to that period. Also, recent history has seen the post-announcement
    decline in the VIX extending two additional days to now span four days following
    the announcement.

    the past 33 years to magically reappear for each FOMC announcement going forward,
    but I do believe that the historical pattern does say something about human nature,
    uncertainty and perceptions of [risk](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/risk).

- en: It is worth noting that the biggest one-day jump in the VIX on a Fed day dates
    from February 4, [1994](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/1994), when
    Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan surprised the markets by announcing a
    0.25% increase in the federal funds rate, helping to lift the VIX 41.9% on that
    day. For comparison purposes, the next largest Fed day VIX increase was a 15.1%
    gain on March 15, 2011\. While another VIX pop may be in the cards, history says
    there is a 72% chance the VIX will decline on Wednesday and that the decline should
    average about 2.6% or about 0.44 based on the current level of the VIX.
