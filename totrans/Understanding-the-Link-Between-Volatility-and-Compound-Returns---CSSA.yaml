    a key focus for asset management. Witness the birth of “low-volatility” ETFs and
    the popularity of minimum-variance portfolios borne from empirical studies that
    demonstrate their superior performance to alternative methodologies.  It seems
    obvious from the research that volatility is an important factor to consider in
    portfolio management, but it is neccessary to understand why this is the case.
    The answer lies in the relationship between the geometric return and the arithmetic
    return. The geometric return is the return that is achieved through reinvestment
    or compounding, while the arithmetic return is the simple average of the returns.
    Often the difference between the two is framed in terms of  the impact of positive
    versus negative returns when you stay invested (compound your wealth). Most traders
    understand that large losses hurt their accounts more than a gain of the same
    magnitude would help their account: for example if you lose 33% of your wealth
    you need to make 50% to get back to even. Therefore avoiding large losses should
    be more important than seeking gains to maximize the growth of your account. This
    insight is part of the rationale behind trend-following and is also the common
    justification for traders to judiciously use stop losses. It makes for an excellent
    example of homespun investment folk wisdom that captures the spirit but fails
    to capture the science. What is less clear to the vast majority of traders is
    the deleterious impact of a re-investing wealth in a volatile stream of smaller-sized
    returns. More formally, Cooper [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1664823](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1664823)  expresses this
    relationship is  by the equality:'

    size of 100%, when x= 5%, an investor would have one 5% up day followed by a -5%
    down day.  Instead of breaking even as one would assume, the investor would have
    lost -.25%.

    advocates!) and generalizes to the mathematical conclusion that the geometric
    mean is significantly and directly impacted by the variance of returns. Other
    things being equal, highly levered or very volatile investments tend to be very
    hazardous to compound performance. Most investors in 3x leveraged bull or bear
    etfs- that promise constant arithmetic leverage- have learned this relationship the
    hard way. Often the returns of both bull and bear etfs lose money over time while
    the underlying index has positive returns. The mathematics that drive this  relationship are
    very simple:'

    compound return by half of the variation or risk of the asset returns. The greater
    the risk or variation, the larger the difference between average returns and compound
    returns. This relationship is a mathematical identity that is true for all time
    series and is used in the disparate fields of telecom, computer science and biology.  The
    difference between arithmetic returns and geometric returns is the “volatility
    drag”. The name implies that compound returns are “dragged down” by high levels
    of volatility to the point that they can be negative despite a high level of arithmetic
    returns.  However, Cooper shows that leverage plays a key moderating factor in
    this relationship. This subject is more complex, and for now lets assume the more
    typical case where one is fully invested. Here is the derivation of the formula
    above expressed in volatility terms:'

    of compound returns- especially when the average return is low and the risk is
    high (think 2008!). Assuming returns are moderate to low, volatility has a dominating
    role in explaining the gap between arithmetic and compound (geometric) returns. Given
    that most academic research studies focus on compound returns, it should not be surprising
    that research shows that high-risk stocks underperform low-risk stocks. Apparently
    many people seem to think that this is an “anomaly” or a great way to find stocks
    that will have a higher return. Academics are puzzled by this finding that seems
    to fly in the face of the conventional theory that to increase returns you need
    to take on more risk. But it is important to note that risk premiums- or the relationship
    between required higher rates of return for higher risk- are arithmetic. That
    means that the curious underperformance of high risk stocks/assets versus low
    risk stocks/assets probably has less to do with a hidden risk factor or behavioral
    bias, but rather the fact that we are compounding our wealth. Falkenstein   [http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2012/01/is-arithmetic-return-bias-basis-of-low.html](http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2012/01/is-arithmetic-return-bias-basis-of-low.html) 
    shows that high risk stocks actually have a higher arithmetic return than the
    market, however the compound return is much lower due to the volatility drag.
    The “low-volatility anomaly” is generally explained by the mathematical relationship
    between volatility and compound returns. The residual difference is likely explained
    by the behavioral bias towards seeking higher returns without regard to the added
    risk– clearly part of this bias is due to the ignorance of subtleties of the math.
