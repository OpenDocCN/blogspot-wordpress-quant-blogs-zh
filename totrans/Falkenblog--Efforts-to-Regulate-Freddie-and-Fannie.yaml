    when they were sowing the seeds of this current mess, berating the motives of
    those who were criticizing these institutions, and Franklin Raines' statement
    about mortgages

    on the disastrous idea that increasing homeownership would be riskless, but I
    think the balance of blame is clear. [Interestingly, George Bush's biggest failures
    were, in my opinion, his efforts to do classically liberal policies, such as No
    Child Left Behind, the Iraq War (very Wilsonian), and the 'ownership' society.--But
    the Left hates him more than ever].
