**Mid-week market update**

: The most recent stock market downdraft was sparked by the news of a new virus variant that was initially identified in South Africa and the Fed's hawkish pivot.

A two-dose regime was less effective but still prevents severe illness. Here we are, the S&P 500 is within 1% of its all-time high again.
