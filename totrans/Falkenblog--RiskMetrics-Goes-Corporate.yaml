    as a risk manager started as an attempt to implement the then-new (1994) RiskMetrics
    Value-at-Risk methodology to the KeyCorp trading operations. Sure, for any nuanced
    strategy, they are ''academic'', in that they do not understand a lot of parochial
    issues related to, say, risk arb, but for setting a benchmark, understanding certain
    tools are useful, and being clear, I give them an A+.'

    how senior risk management as a profession is mainly about appearances and going
    through the motions. To be specific, official risk management, which is what RiskMetrics
    now advises upon, is mainly staffed by prigs and props. A prig is someone wedded
    to a theory that explains everything, and can be highly mathematical and conventional,
    like

    expect'' [which I find not profound, but irrelevant]. The key is they are true

    posts, and they basically have a full time PR job, catching flak from outsiders
    about decisions not made in their presence. Official Risk Management futility
    comes from the fact they are graded on their ability to generate reports read
    by people three levels removed from a business, so that why the props need the
    prigs, for references. The prigs need the props to add credibility to what they
    do, though I think it would be most accurate to say there's some truth in what
    prigs do, but only if you know where to find it. Nuance, the things that really
    matter for a businesses survival, don't travel up the chain well, so everything
    is fit into cookie cutters based on the most recent conspicuous financial failures.

  zh: 然后是"props"，那些实际上运行高级风险管理岗位的人，他们基本上做全职公关工作，接受外部人士对没有在场自己决策的指责。官方的风险管理无效，是因为他们根据自己能否生成报告被评分，而这些报告是由与业务三级联系的人阅读的，所以props需要prigs来提供参考。prigs需要props来增加他们所做的工作的可信度，尽管我认为最准确的说法是prigs所做的事情有一定道理，但只有你知道在哪里找到它。细微之处，对于企业的生存而言真正重要的事情，不会很好地上升到链条上，因此一切都被塑造成最近显眼的金融失败为基础的模板。
- en: I wonder if the RiskMetrics management has convinced themselves this really
    addresses risk, or they realize it's simply the way the game is played, and they
    have to make a living. I'm too cynical to pull it off convincingly. I'm saddened
    by the whole thing because I understand a lot about actual risk management, but
    realize how irrelevant that knowledge is to risk management as practiced by large,
    regulated firms.

  zh: 我想知道RiskMetrics管理层是否已经说服自己这真的解决了风险问题，还是他们意识到这只是游戏规则，他们必须谋生。我过于愤世嫉俗，无法令人信服地表现出来。整件事情让我感到悲哀，因为我对实际风险管理的了解很多，但我意识到这些知识对大型受监管公司实践的风险管理是多么无关紧要。
