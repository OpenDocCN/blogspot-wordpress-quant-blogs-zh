    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    signal. A bullish Trend Model signal that gets less bullish is a trading "sell"
    signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading
    "buy" signal. The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of
    the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. Past trading of
    the trading model has shown turnover rates of about 200% per month.

    What happened to "three steps and a stumble"?

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The old Wall Street trader's adage of "three steps and a stumble" refers to
    the stock market's reaction to Fed rate hike cycles. At first, stock prices don't
    react to the Fed raising rates, but eventually the market succumbs to the economic
    cooling effects of monetary policy, and a bear market usually begins after three
    rate hikes. Hence, "three and a stumble". The chart below from

    This expansion cycle has been unusual in that the Fed began raising rates two
    years ago. We have seen five consecutive quarter-point rate hikes, so where's
    the stumble?
