    is finding opportunities, instead of focusing on the daily gyrations of the stock
    market and whether it has found a short-term bottom, which is a topic I will cover
    in a post this weekend.

- en: The art of bottom fishing requires a strong constitution, which is suitable
    for people like my inner investor who has a longer time horizon. You have to go
    into the exercise thinking that you don't care that you catch the exact bottom,
    but with a mindset that Mr. Market has put a sale price on an investment. You
    may buy X at $10, see it fall to $7, but be ultimately rewarded in several years
    when it rises to $20, $30 or $40 (note that these are just examples and not return
    forecasts).
