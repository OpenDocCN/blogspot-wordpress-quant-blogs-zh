    that welcome unconventional people-gays, immigrants, artists, and free-thinking
    'bohemians'-are ideal for nurturing the creativity and innovation that characterize
    the knowledge economy". Did he mention gays? It seems that "Gays predict not only
    the concentration of high-tech industry, but also its growth" Fabulous!

    quality and range of schools is certainly critical for parents of school-age children."
    Amen. Basically, he argues we should create neighborhoods of loft apartments,
    good schools (how?), and a tolerance for diversity—catnip for bohemians—and growth
    will occur. It plays to the naive view of artsy creativity that sells itself.
    No wonder he reportedly gets $35k per lecture.

    than we were initially inclined to be. Critics complain that schools squelch creativity,
    but most people are inclined to be more creative on the job than would be truly
    productive. So schooling is mostly about selecting the smarter and more diligent,
    and learning to show up day after day to somewhat boring jobs with ambiguous instructions.

    ways to encourage people to focus on important issues, identify the most promising
    ideas, and tell the right people about them. But our deification of creativity
    gets in the way.

    with a spirit of creativity. We instead need to better manage the flood of ideas
    we already have and to reward managers for actually executing them.
