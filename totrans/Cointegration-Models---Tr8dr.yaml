    for the Canadian bond market on daily or more frequent sampling, based on a variety
    of market data and fundamental factors. I had not developed a model like this
    before and was skeptical that could produce a useful result short of some man
    years of research.

    spread between one security and another. With a multivariate cointegration, one
    trades a long or short basket against the cointegrating security.
