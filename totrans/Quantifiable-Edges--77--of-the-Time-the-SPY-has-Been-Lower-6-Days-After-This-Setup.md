# Quantifiable Edges: 77% of the Time the SPY has Been Lower 6 Days After This Setup

Action in SPY the last couple of days has been interesting as it has left large unfilled gaps in both directions.

[The Quantifinder](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2009/05/quantifinder-unveiled.html)

identified the study below. It looks at other instances where you had a 20-day closing high, then an unfilled gap down, and then an unfilled gap up. All results are updated.

These results seem to suggest a moderate downside edge over the next 6 days.
