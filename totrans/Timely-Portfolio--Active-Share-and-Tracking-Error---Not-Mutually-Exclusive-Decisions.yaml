- en: '[Antti Petajisto](http://www.petajisto.net/research.html) got a lot of attention
    with his [research on Active Share and Tracking Error in mutual fund management](http://www.cfapubs.org/doi/pdf/10.2469/faj.v69.n4.7). 
    While the research is fairly compelling, there is a missing discussion about a
    potential relationship between the two measures. The paper seems to suggest that
    mutual fund managers can independently and intentionally pursue Active Share and/or
    Tracking Error.  However, some [research from the PIMCO Quantitative Team](http://media.pimco.com/Documents/PIMCO_Quantitative_Research_Active_Share_Tracking_Error_Sapra_Hun.pdf)
    argues that Active Share and Tracking Error are related and that they can easily
    be a byproduct of other decisions such as benchmark or fund exposure.  I strongly
    suggest reading both sets of research to gather a full understanding of these
    concepts.'

    my head, so I copied the data and with a couple lines of R + rCharts got all the
    visualization I needed.
