- en: Jack Welch is one of the most recognizable names in business as the former CEO
    of General Electric. His skills and leadership in running one of the largest companies
    in the world have been the source of numerous books and case studies in the business
    literature. Running such a large corporation like GE that makes investments all
    over the world and employs tens of thousands of people is so complex for one person
    that it requires intelligent heuristics to manage effectively. Most certainly
    these “rules of thumb” that Jack Welch used have proven themselves in the real
    world. So the question is, what can we learn from Jack about portfolio management?

  zh: 杰克·韦尔奇是商业界最知名的名字之一，曾任通用电气公司首席执行官。他在世界上最大公司之一的运营中展现的技能和领导力，已经成为商业文献中众多书籍和案例研究的基础。像通用电气这样的大型公司，在全球范围内进行投资并雇佣数万人，对于一个人来说是非常复杂的，需要智能启发式方法来有效管理。可以肯定的是，杰克·韦尔奇使用的这些“经验法则”在现实世界中已经得到了证明。所以问题在于，我们能从杰克关于投资组合管理中学到什么？
- en: One of the famous approaches that Jack was known for was to fire the least productive
    employees in his workforce. In fact, he chose to let go roughly 10% of his workforce
    each year. His philosophy was slightly more nuanced, and there is a good clip
    in wikipedia [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitality_curve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitality_curve)

  zh: 杰克人所共知的方法之一是解雇他劳动力中最不生产的员工。事实上，他选择让大约10%的劳动力每年离职。他的哲学稍微复杂一些，维基百科上有一个很好的剪辑[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitality_curve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitality_curve)提到

  zh: 更详细地介绍了他的理论。以下是关键摘录：
- en: “Jack Welch’s vitality model has been described as a “20-70-10” system. The
    “top 20” percent of the workforce is most productive, and 70% (the “vital 70”)
    work adequately. The other 10% (“bottom 10”) are nonproducers and should be fired.
    “Rank-and-yank” advocates credit Welch’s rank-and-yank system with a 28-fold increase
    in earnings (and a 5-fold increase in revenue) at GE between 1981 and 2001.

  zh: 杰克·韦尔奇的生命力模型被描述为“20-70-10”系统。劳动力中的“前20%”是最有生产力的，70%（“活力70%”）的工作尚可。其余的10%（“底部10%）是不生产者，应该被解雇。“排名和筛选”的支持者认为，韦尔奇的排名和筛选系统在1981年至2001年期间使通用电气的收益增加了28倍（收入增加了5倍）。
- en: In Straight from the Gut, Welch says that he asked “each of the GE’s businesses
    to rank all of their top executives”. Specifically (in accordance with the 20-70-10
    model) the top executives were divided into “A”, “B”, and “C” players. Welch admitted
    that the judgments were “not always precise”.

  zh: 在《直接来自心底》一书中，韦尔奇说，他要求“通用电气的每个业务部门对他们所有的高级执行人员进行排名”。具体来说（根据20-70-10模型）高级执行人员被分为“A”、“B”和“C”类。韦尔奇承认，这些判断“并不总是精确的”。
- en: Essentially “A” executives were in the top 20% and considered a key value center
    for the company, “B” employees were the middle 70% and were considered vital but
    not extraordinary, and 10% were considered to be of little value—“non-producers”
    in Jack parlance. If there is truth to the theory that this heuristic was critical
    for GE’s success during his tenure, then there are some lessons to be drawn for
    portfolio management. The most obvious is that historical performance is predictive
    of future performance, and thus momentum or relative-strength investing should
    be effective. Of course this is well-supported in the academic literature. But
    what is interesting to me is the concept of “firing” C players–or the bottom 10%,
    and also the concept of considering the B players to be vital to the organization.
    What this implies is that we should “cut our losers”–a concept validated by “trend-following”
    and many of the greatest traders of all-time. But the concept of keeping the B
    players is counter-intuitive, and yet for portfolio management this implies that
    one should keep most of the middle-performing holdings as a base of diversification
    to support the top 20%. One can easily see how this can be applied with several
    different variations as a portfolio algorithm.

  zh: 本质上，“A”级高管属于公司中最顶尖的20%，被视为公司的关键价值中心，“B”级员工构成了中间的70%，被认为是重要但并不出挑的，而10%的员工被认为价值不大——在杰克·韦尔奇的用语中就是“非生产者”。如果这一启发性理论确实对他在通用电气（GE）的成功至关重要，那么对于投资组合管理来说，我们可以从中吸取一些教训。最明显的一个教训是历史业绩可以预测未来业绩，因此动量或相对强度投资应该有效。这一点在学术文献中得到了充分支持。但对我来说，更有趣的是“解雇”C级员工——即最底层的10%，以及将B级员工视为对组织至关重要的概念。这暗示我们应该“淘汰失败者”——这一点被“趋势跟随”策略和许多史上最伟大的交易员所验证。然而，保留B级员工的概念似乎与直觉相悖，但对于投资组合管理来说，这意味着我们应该保留大部分中等表现的投资作为多元化的基础，以支持那最顶尖的20%。人们可以很容易地看到，如何通过几种不同的变体将这一理念应用于投资组合算法中。
- en: As but one of many examples, suppose you started with a diversified basket of
    100 stocks. You could overweight the top 20 by 1-year returns (50% of the portfolio),
    keep a smaller weight in the middle 70 by 1-year returns (50% of the portfolio),
    and simply cut the remaining 10 stocks at each rebalancing period- say every quarter
    (0% of the portfolio). Suppose one repeated this process until they were left
    with 10 stocks or fewer, at this point one could start again with 100 stocks.
    In theory this method could also function as a “follow-the-leader” algorithm in
    keeping with the last post. This variant might look at the cumulative performance
    or a combination of cumulative and rolling performance until you ended up with
    a handful of stocks. This method of “force-feeding” winners in your portfolio
    with capital is an approach long-heralded by William O’Neill and other trading
    legends. While I have not yet tested these variants, I expect to put this simple
    yet intuitive heuristic algorithm to the test.

  zh: 作为众多例子中的一个，假设你最初持有一篮子100只多元化的股票。你可以通过1年回报率对最顶尖的20%进行超配（占组合的50%），对中间70%的股票也通过1年回报率保持较小的权重（占组合的50%），而在每个再平衡周期——比如每个季度（占组合的0%）——简单地剔除剩余的10只股票。假设一个人重复这个过程，直到他们剩下10只股票或更少，此时他们可以重新开始，从100只股票开始。从理论上讲，这种方法也可以作为一种“跟随领导者”的算法，与上篇文章的内容保持一致。这种变体可能会关注累计表现或累计表现与滚动表现相结合，直到剩下几只股票。这种通过资本“强制喂养”投资组合中赢家的方法，是威廉·O’尼尔和其他交易传奇长期推崇的策略。虽然我还没有测试这些变体，但我期望能对这些简单而直观的启发性算法进行测试。
