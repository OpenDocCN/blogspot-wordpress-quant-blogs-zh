- en: Jack Welch is one of the most recognizable names in business as the former CEO
    of General Electric. His skills and leadership in running one of the largest companies
    in the world have been the source of numerous books and case studies in the business
    literature. Running such a large corporation like GE that makes investments all
    over the world and employs tens of thousands of people is so complex for one person
    that it requires intelligent heuristics to manage effectively. Most certainly
    these “rules of thumb” that Jack Welch used have proven themselves in the real
    world. So the question is, what can we learn from Jack about portfolio management?

- en: One of the famous approaches that Jack was known for was to fire the least productive
    employees in his workforce. In fact, he chose to let go roughly 10% of his workforce
    each year. His philosophy was slightly more nuanced, and there is a good clip
    in wikipedia [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitality_curve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitality_curve)

- en: “Jack Welch’s vitality model has been described as a “20-70-10” system. The
    “top 20” percent of the workforce is most productive, and 70% (the “vital 70”)
    work adequately. The other 10% (“bottom 10”) are nonproducers and should be fired.
    “Rank-and-yank” advocates credit Welch’s rank-and-yank system with a 28-fold increase
    in earnings (and a 5-fold increase in revenue) at GE between 1981 and 2001.

- en: In Straight from the Gut, Welch says that he asked “each of the GE’s businesses
    to rank all of their top executives”. Specifically (in accordance with the 20-70-10
    model) the top executives were divided into “A”, “B”, and “C” players. Welch admitted
    that the judgments were “not always precise”.

- en: Essentially “A” executives were in the top 20% and considered a key value center
    for the company, “B” employees were the middle 70% and were considered vital but
    not extraordinary, and 10% were considered to be of little value—“non-producers”
    in Jack parlance. If there is truth to the theory that this heuristic was critical
    for GE’s success during his tenure, then there are some lessons to be drawn for
    portfolio management. The most obvious is that historical performance is predictive
    of future performance, and thus momentum or relative-strength investing should
    be effective. Of course this is well-supported in the academic literature. But
    what is interesting to me is the concept of “firing” C players–or the bottom 10%,
    and also the concept of considering the B players to be vital to the organization.
    What this implies is that we should “cut our losers”–a concept validated by “trend-following”
    and many of the greatest traders of all-time. But the concept of keeping the B
    players is counter-intuitive, and yet for portfolio management this implies that
    one should keep most of the middle-performing holdings as a base of diversification
    to support the top 20%. One can easily see how this can be applied with several
    different variations as a portfolio algorithm.

    100 stocks. You could overweight the top 20 by 1-year returns (50% of the portfolio),
    keep a smaller weight in the middle 70 by 1-year returns (50% of the portfolio),
    and simply cut the remaining 10 stocks at each rebalancing period- say every quarter
    (0% of the portfolio). Suppose one repeated this process until they were left
    with 10 stocks or fewer, at this point one could start again with 100 stocks.
    In theory this method could also function as a “follow-the-leader” algorithm in
    keeping with the last post. This variant might look at the cumulative performance
    or a combination of cumulative and rolling performance until you ended up with
    a handful of stocks. This method of “force-feeding” winners in your portfolio
    with capital is an approach long-heralded by William O’Neill and other trading
    legends. While I have not yet tested these variants, I expect to put this simple
    yet intuitive heuristic algorithm to the test.
