    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    Momentum is dying, and across a variety of dimensions. One key technique that
    I use to monitor momentum is the behavior of different moving averages. If the
    shorter moving average starts to roll over while the longer moving average continues
    to rise, that's a sign of fading price momentum.

    over. I find that the weekly chart is useful for intermediate term price moves
    while filtering out the noise from daily fluctuations.

    or market downdraft. I expect that the most likely outcome is a correction that
    will last 1-3 months, followed by a resumption of the bull market.
