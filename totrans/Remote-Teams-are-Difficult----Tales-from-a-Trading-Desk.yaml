- en: Lets start by saying that even a team located in the same building, on the same
    floor, sitting together and working on the same project, often have collaboration
    issues that take time to iron out.  When you now move to a remote team, the space/time
    between the remote pieces of the team generate some new issues, and exaggerate
    may of the local team issues.  Jeff, [over](http://www.jeffgothelf.com/blog/designing-with-remote-teams/)
    on Perception Is The Experience, offers some thoughts around remote teams, and
    some good evidence that remote teams can, and do work efficiently.

    most people want when working in a remote team.  It offers the ability to feel
    connected, to see a face, and strike a conversation in a more personal way.

    getting to know people makes a massive difference.
