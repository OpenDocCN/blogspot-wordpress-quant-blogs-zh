- en: Although there are definite pockets of .NET development in most investment banks
    on Wall Street, the majority of the development efforts are still in Java, especially
    on the server side. This is nowhere more apparent than in the investment bank
    that I am currently working for.

    for the Java community, and the I have been similarly impressed with the sense
    of comradery that the Java community has. Most of the interesting .NET tools have
    origins in the Java world (NUnit, Spring, Hibernate, etc).

    terms of client-side frameworks and to come up with a proposal for a company-wide
    framework. This means looking at the toolkits that various groups are using or
    currently developing, looking at what I have done in the past, and making some
    recommendations by taking the best-of-breed of the various efforts. In addition
    to looking at .NET frameworks, I have been asked to look at some of the Java frameworks.
    And, I have been impressed by some of the Java efforts.

    RCP. Several of my colleagues have blogged in the past about the viability of
    Eclpise RCP as a client-side framework. I feel that I need to take a serious look
    at it.

- en: You all know that I have been a staunch advocate of .NET in the past. However,
    I am finding it more difficult to beat back the Java supporters. Some of the arguments
    that I have used against Java in the past (slowness, not as nice a UI, etc) have
    been colored by my past experiences with AWT, Swing, and JFC. But, Java GUI development
    has definitely evolved.
