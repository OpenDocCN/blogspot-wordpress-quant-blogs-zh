    M, please email us at* [*dvindicators@gmail.com*](mailto:dvindicators@gmail.com)
    *to receive spreadsheet later this weekend. Note we use a cleaner version of data
    than Yahoo Finance adjusted for splits and dividends with verified closing prices.
    I have been made aware that the backtest results using Yahoo are different from
    ours (note we calculated the same values as our readers using Yahoo Finance),
    and that is because their data is not entirely accurate.*'

    a rising 200 ma. When the market falls below this level  favor CASH first and
    only at the initial stages do some selected shorting. Shorting has **much** lower
    edges than long strategies in testing on a risk/reward and absolute basis.

- en: '2) **Keep an Eye on The Big Picture:** Most of the fluctuation in individual
    stocks is driven by the S&P500 or Nasdaq Composite, secondly fluctuation is driven
    by the sector or industry that the stock is in,  in last place is the unique movement
    of the stock itself. LESSON: don’t delude yourself into thinking that you will
    be sheltered from recessions or market crashes because you hold a “good business
    or quality management.” Valuations and dividends are also often poor consolation.'

- en: 3) **Follow Relative Strength only in Bull Markets: **  Follow Relative Strength
    (percentile rank of 52-week price returns relative to the universe) only above
    the 200 ma , this is the best and most tradeable stock selection tool of any factor.
    My research shows that with the exception of small and microcap stocks, there
    is no alpha using relative strength strategies below the 200 ma. In fact, the
    more the market falls, the worse this strategy does as it tends to pick up only
    the low-beta stocks. When the market gets really stretched the worst relative
    strength stocks vastly outperform the market and high relative strength stocks.

- en: 4) **Mean-reversion strategies do better in periods of high volatility:** and/or
     under the 200 ma. Day-trading strategies also thrive in these environments primarily
    with few exceptions. Trading mean-reversion outside of these “zones” is difficult
    because of commissions relative to average gains per trade. Also the market has
    lost money intraday net of the overnight return for the last 15 years

- en: 5) **Don’t Always Believe the Backtest:** Short-term strategies in general are
    FAR less likely to match backtest results in real-life than long-term strategies.
    This is because the half-life of any good short-term strategy is short, and because
    the commissions and executions/slippage have a significant effect on performance.

  zh: 5) **不要总是相信回测结果：** 一般来说，短期策略要比长期策略在现实生活中更不可能与回测结果相匹配。这是因为任何良好的短期策略的半衰期都很短，而且佣金和成交/滑点对绩效有重大影响。
- en: '6) **Don’t Become a Perma-Bear:** Ironically being overly realistic or pessimistic
    will hurt your performance badly as a trader. Being calm with a small dose of
    optimism and a willingness to make mistakes and learn from them is crucial to
    being a good trader. All of the crusty bears are so worried about appearing smart
    and being vindicated with bold calls, that they are unwilling to change their
    minds. At times it seems they would rather be right and broke than make money
    by following the herd. As Ed Seykota says: “Everybody gets what they want in the
    stock market.” From a pure mathematical standpoint the odds favor longs  because
    stocks can go up 200% and 300%, but they can only drop to “0”—I have yet to find
    a short or long term strategy for shorting that remotely compares with the risk/reward
    of long-only strategies.'

  zh: 6) **不要成为永久的熊市拥护者：** 具有讽刺意味的是，过分现实或悲观会严重影响你作为交易者的表现。保持冷静，带着一丝乐观，并愿意犯错并从中吸取教训对成为一名优秀的交易者至关重要。所有顽固的熊市拥护者都过于担心表现得聪明和被大胆预测证实，以至于不愿改变主意。有时候，他们似乎宁愿正确但破产，也不愿通过跟随群众赚钱。正如艾德·赛科塔所说：“每个人在股市都会得到他们想要的东西。”从纯数学的角度来看，赢家的机会更大，因为股票可以上涨200%和300%，但它们只能跌至“0”—我还没有找到一个短期或长期空头策略，能与仅做多策略的风险/收益相提并论。
