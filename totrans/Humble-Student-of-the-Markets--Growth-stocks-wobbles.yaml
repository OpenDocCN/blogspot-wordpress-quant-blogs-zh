    driving productivity, then it's not about declaring some tech companies winners

    growth is historically quite low, even though we have an economy that's dominated

    up in the growth stock armor. The chart below shows an unexpected divergence in
    relative performance between large cap and small cap growth (top panel). If we
    were to benchmark US large and small cap stocks against global stocks, as measured
    by the MSCI All-Country World Index (ACWI), we can see that large cap growth remains
    in a relative uptrend against ACWI (middle panel), but the relative performance
    of small caps and small cap growth have flattened in the past few months.
