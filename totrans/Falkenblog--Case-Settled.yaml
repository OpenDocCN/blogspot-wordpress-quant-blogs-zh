- en: 1) After you leave your employer, search all your hard drives for any file 'created'
    or 'modified' during the period of your employment. It doesn't matter if you think
    it is not a secret or even work related. Delete them, regardless of their public
    domain nature, because ‘public domain’ is a subjective assessment. Transfer any
    remaining files onto an external device. Install software on new hard drives,
    then transfer over any legacy files from the external device. Finally, destroy
    the external device used in the intermediate transfer. You want nothing remotely
    connected to the tenure of your employment in your position, regardless of relevancy,
    including deleted files, cached snippets of files from Google Desktop, shadow
    copies, etc.

  zh: 1) 离开雇主后，搜索你所有硬盘上在任职期间创建或修改的任何文件。不管你认为它是否保密或与工作相关都没关系。删除它们，不管它们是否属于公共领域，因为“公共领域”是一种主观评价。将剩余的文件转移到外部设备上。在新硬盘上安装软件，然后从外部设备转移任何旧文件。最后，销毁用于中间传输的外部设备。你不希望任何与你在职期间有关的东西，无论其相关性如何，包括已删除的文件、来自
    Google Desktop 的缓存文件片段、影子副本等。
- en: 2) Note the prior legal activity of your business associates by searching the
    state and federal district websites. Read the actual cases, there's usually a
    good bit a detail, so it rarely requires a law degree or insider knowledge to
    assess the merits (the court has to assess cases using the law, individuals can
    rely on their common sense). Also, look at the experience of ex-employees. If
    they all seem to get ‘different’ jobs, this suggests there might be some legal
    intimidation that never made it into the court record. Remember, everyone but
    total psychopaths consider themselves to be acting righteously, and smart people
    can rationalize anything. Look at what they do.

  zh: 2) 通过搜索州和联邦地区网站了解你的业务伙伴的先前法律活动。阅读实际案例，通常有很多细节，因此评估其价值很少需要法律学位或内部知识（法院必须使用法律评估案件，个人可以依靠常识）。还要看看前雇员的经验。如果他们似乎都找到了“不同”的工作，这表明可能存在一些从未出现在法院记录中的法律恐吓。请记住，除了完全的精神病患者，每个人都认为自己在行事正当，聪明人可以为任何事情辩解。看看他们的行为。
- en: 3) Expect your adversary to take everything your write down or have said out
    of context, because that's what good lawyers do. The US legal system is predicated
    on the idea that justice comes from two highly biased, opposing perspectives,
    so they see tendentious arguments as part of a greater good. The more things you
    have written, the higher the probability that some snippet can be made to look
    incriminating. Therefore, to the degree possible, get in the habit of using the
    phone, or meetings, to discuss strategy, tactics, or anything substantive.

  zh: 3) 期待你的对手断章取义，因为这是优秀律师的做法。美国法律体系建立在这样一个理念上，即正义源自两种高度偏见的、相互对立的观点，因此他们认为有争议的论点是为了更大的利益。你写的东西越多，某些片段被搬出来看起来可疑的可能性就越高。因此，在可能的范围内，养成使用电话或会议讨论战略、策略或任何实质性事项的习惯。
- en: 4) In large corporations, legal action needs to be justified to higher-ups who
    don't give a damn about petty slights and injured egos. Therefore, if you are
    in a case that seems not justified by some cost-benefit calculation, avoid big
    corporate lawyers because they will be flummoxed by your adversary.

- en: 5) Civil litigation is about pretext, process, and justice, in various degrees
    depending on the players and issues involved. Making a pretext look like a principle,
    and working the process, is where lawyers earn their money. Most civil litigation
    does not go to trial, which means the merits or consistency of the case is not
    very relevant because such issues are mainly relevant at trial, and judges like
    to defer anything close to a judgment on merit to juries.

  zh: 5) 民事诉讼涉及借口、流程和正义，在不同程度上取决于参与者和问题的相关性。把借口看起来像原则，操纵流程，这就是律师挣钱的地方。大多数民事诉讼不会进行审判，这意味着案件的价值或一致性并不是很重要，因为这些问题主要在审判时才相关，法官喜欢把几乎所有与案件价值相关的问题都推给陪审团。

- en: 9) Litigation is combat, sometimes necessary to protect one’s livelihood, justice,
    or reputation. But like fistfights, the vast majority are stupid. While fighting
