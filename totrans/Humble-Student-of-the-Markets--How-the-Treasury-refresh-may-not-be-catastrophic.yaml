- en: It was said that the U.S. Treasury market would see a flood of new issuance
    which would draw liquidity from the financial system. Such a loss of liquidity
    would create significant headwinds for the prices of risk assets. Since the conclusion
    of the debt ceiling deal, the warnings have become a cacophony. Estimates vary,
    but consensus market expectations call for the issuance of about $1 trillion in
    Treasury paper over the next three months.

- en: I have warned before about the liquidity impact of new Treasury issuance and
    I am certainly cognizant of the risks. However, there is a narrow path for a benign
    resolution of the reset of the U.S. Treasury’s cash balances without significantly
    affecting the price of risk assets.
