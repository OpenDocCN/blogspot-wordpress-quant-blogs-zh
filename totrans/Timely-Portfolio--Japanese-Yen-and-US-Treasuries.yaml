    Treasuries from 1993 to 2008 is clear.  However, the highly correlated instruments
    have moved opposite since the 2008 financial crisis.

    Japanese Yen, but this does not show up on IMF Reserves.

    are pursued as insurance similar to gold.  However, these only work simultaneously
    in a deflationary environment.  If inflation appears (I think it is here), but
    others clearly disagree, does the Yen get hurt with US Treasuries?

    Japan carries a higher default probability on its sovereign debt.

    currency simply following a trend model.  However in the multi-trillion currency
    market, I do not think this influence would be strong enough to force this imbalance.
