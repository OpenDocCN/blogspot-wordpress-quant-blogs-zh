    they are guarding against aren't absurd. For example, average credit card charge-offs
    are 5% a year. The baseline case is 6-8%, and the adverse 9-10%. Consumer loans
    don't move as much in bad times, and I haven't heard of aggregate credit card
    charge offs that high, but if the Roubini scenario arises, I guess it's possible.
    C&I loans they think might rise to 4% (annualized), which is a reasonable worst
    case scenario. And so on down the line.

    money quotes) and other doomsters think this is all capture by the banks, that
    we should nationalize asap and put someone more public minded on their boards,
    like Franklin Raines or Jamie Gorelick. Looking to the ex-Chief Economist at the
    IMF for advice on financial markets is like asking Ronald McDonald for advice
    on a good menu--the guy was a PR prop. The IMF are a bunch of top-down do-gooders
    with a horrible track record. His current credibility comes from first his position
    at MIT, and then journalists thinking that businessmen actually listen to the
    chief economists of aid groups like the IMF. I hope they realize that the FCC
    and other regulator bodies that cover journalists have economists. I'm sure they
    have no clue, or care, what these people think.

    assume that capital is a cushion for losses on a static portfolio. But banks do
    not have static portfolios, they have franchises, with a lot of turnover and brandvalue.
    A bad analogy is at the bottom of all bad ideas, and the bad analogy here is that
    a bank is closed-end portfolio of rated securities. It's a franchise, with brand
    value, and most of its present value is from assets currently not on the books.

    asset ratio above for the banks under review. There should be a negative relatioship
    between the cushion (capital/risk weighted assets), and volatility. There is,
    but the R2 is 0.06, meaning, the relationship is insignificant (note: using implied
    volatilities gives the same result). So, the market does not see a strong correlation
    between capital-to-assets and risk, but for the Treasury, that is all that matters.
    This highlights that what is measured (capital to assets) is what is managed by
    super senior management, no matter how irrelevant.'

    that occurred prior to 2008\. Did regulators ever mention this, except when encouraging
    them? Thus, like macroeconomics, the keys are incentives that are decentralized
    and parochial to a small niche (big banks have literally hundreds of different
    businesses with different underwriting criteria and expected losses), but top-down
    diktats can only address big things like 'total capital to assets', and so the
    focus. This highlights the random nature of Federal regulation.

    let the market render their verdict. Everything gets complicated when government
    has to micromanage something they are dilettantes in. It would be nice if banks
    had to disclose greater particularity about the nature of their assets and liabilities.
    Regulations can be good, and made better. But this exercise is like the
