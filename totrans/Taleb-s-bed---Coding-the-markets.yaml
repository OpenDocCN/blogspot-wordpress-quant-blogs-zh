    Now that I’m working for the Greek goddess of heroic endeavours, it’s nice to
    see some Greek mythology in Taleb’s work. I’ve been a fan since a colleague recommended
    Fooled by Randomness in 2003\. His work has always had a strong epistemological
    flavour, and he’s done more than most to popularise the work of Karl Popper –
    the originator of the Black Swan metaphor – which is no bad thing. From Taleb’s
    new material it appears he’s becoming a full time philosopher, no doubt because
    he’s achieved financial independence !

    are most afraid to contradict is yourself.” The sentiment is not original, and
    I think better expressed by Emerson: “a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of
    narrow minds.”'
