    of selling in Apple ([AAPL](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/AAPL)).
    I was about to label this a correction, but really, which is more correct: AAPL
    at 644 or AAPL at 582? How about the Topeka Capital Markets analyst that put a
    1001 price target on the stock?'

    revenue beats and misses, what may emerge from the product pipeline when, etc.

- en: There are a lot of investors out there that would like to own AAPL or add to
    an existing position. Many of those see the stock as an excellent value at 582,
    but are worried about the possibility of a negative earnings surprise, so they
    are not sure what to do.

    Jared Woodard of [Condor Options](http://condoroptions.com/) likes to say that
    options allow for a [more nuanced language](http://condoroptions.com/2011/09/08/what-options-are-good-for/)
    with which to express an idea about the markets. Rather than having the debate
    be about whether AAPL is a buy at 582, a better question might be, “What sort
    of ‘stink bid’ do I think might reasonably get filled in AAPL and how much can
    I get paid for making that bid?”'

- en: Looking at the AAPL options graphic below, the May 550 puts (right column) are
    currently available for 15.10, so if the short put expires in the money, the net
    cost for these shares will be 535\. The May 520 puts referenced yesterday are
    still available for 7.25, which translates into a cost basis of about 513\. It
    is even possible to sell the May 500 puts for about 4.30, which would mean a cost
    basis of about 496.

    with next week’s earnings announcement, consider selling some out-of-the-money
    puts. You can collect some premium for those puts and if that worst case scenario
    comes true, you can also lock in the stock at a nice discount to today’s price.
