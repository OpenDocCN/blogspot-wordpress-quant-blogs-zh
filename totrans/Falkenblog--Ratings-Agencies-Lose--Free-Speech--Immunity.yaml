- en: U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin ruled on Wednesday in a 68-page opinion
    that the ratings of certain securities -- those that were distributed to a limited
    number of investors -- don't deserve the same free-speech protection as more general
    ratings of corporate bonds that were widely disseminated.

    websites. It's on IBM's investor relations page. In contrast, some special investment
    vehicles have a rating known to a relatively small number of investors. It's not
    illegal to mention the rating, but really, who cares about such parochial funds.
    The example given was for a $1B fund, but there are about $400B of such funds.

- en: I am very sympathetic to the Rating Agencies because I know that in general
    Moody's is filled with thoughtful, sincere people, who because of their culture,
    have better ethics than your average investment banker. That is, very few people
    who work at Ratings agencies make the kind of money prominent investment bankers
    do, and their steady, salaried work generates more far-sighted thinking. Nonetheless,
    they got caught up like everyone else in assuming that in aggregate, US houses
    can not decline in value, an assumption that drove all the insanity.

  zh: 我对评级机构非常有同情心，因为我知道，总的来说，穆迪充满了具有深思熟虑、真诚的人，由于他们的文化，他们的道德比一般的投资银行家更好。换句话说，在评级机构工作的人中很少有人像投资银行家那样赚大钱，他们稳定的工资工作会产生更具远见的思考。尽管如此，他们和其他人一样，陷入了这样的假设：总体上，美国的住房价格不会下跌，这一假设驱使了所有的疯狂。
- en: I am not sympathetic to the 'free speech' gambit, because that seems a bit strained.
    As the judge noted, it's not like they wrote a newspaper article on their opinion,
    but rather, they were paid by a small group of people to deliver a rating delivered
    to a small group of investors. Potentially, there is negligence and bad faith
    involved. If I were the rating agencies, I would argue this was merely a good
    faith error, and highlight how conventional their opinions were by referencing
    contemporaneous statements by academics, regulators, investors, legislators, bankers,
    even Robert Shiller (the famous 'housing bear' whose meek warning highlights how
    common the insanity was). I don't think it is reasonable to legally punish someone
    for holding conventional views, because incorrect conventional views are so common,
    if such errors were actionable we should just turn over corporate revenues to
    the trial lawyers right now. As a practical matter, the scope of damages is too
    large given the historical stupidity of conventional wisdom (busing, new math,
    socialism).

  zh: 我并不赞同‘言论自由’的策略，因为那看起来有点牵强。正如法官所指出的，这不像他们发表了一篇报纸文章上的观点，而是他们受到了一小群人的委托，为一小群投资者提供了一个评级。可能存在疏忽和恶意。如果我是评级机构，我会主张这只是一个善意错误，并通过参照学者、监管机构、投资者、立法者、银行家，甚至是罗伯特·席勒（著名的‘住房熊’，他的温和警告强调了疯狂是多么普遍）的当时声明，来突出他们的观点是多么传统。我认为，从法律上惩罚某人持有传统观点是不合理的，因为不正确的传统观点是如此普遍，如果这样的错误被认为是可诉的，我们现在应该立即把公司的收入交给律师来处理。事实上，鉴于传统智慧的历史愚蠢（如公交、新数学、社会主义），赔偿规模太大了。
- en: One thing I wish the Agencies were pressed on, is presenting the performance
    of their ratings in a standardized way. Currently, the agencies get to present
    their opinion on their opinions, and this cannot be anything but biased. For example,
    from 1993-2007 (the latest data available), Moody's cumulative 5-year 'impairment'
    rate on Residential Mortgage Backed Securities is 0%; for corporate ratings, the
    5-year 'default' rate 0.09%. As they said in The Princess Bride, I don't think
    those words mean what you think they mean.

- en: The problem is the universe of things to rate is very complicated. As a practical
    matter, you do not want to include Municipal bonds, with sovereign ratings, corporate,
    and structured finance. Even within structured finance, you want to disaggregate
    credit cards from commercial real estate. This is because the criteria, the model,
    the data, one applies to these areas is very different, so the relevance of a
    AAA for the IBMs of the world, is very different than the AAA applied to Structured
    Investment Vehicles. One might say, an AAA should mean the same thing, and they
    do attempt to mean the same thing. But they are very different problems, like
    estimating the probability Democrats with the presidency in 2016 vs. the probability
    global temperatures rise by 1 degree Celsius over the next 50 years. AAA targeted
    default rates are so low, you can't calibrate these empirically, you just make
    your best estimate in very different domains.

  zh: 问题在于要评级的事物的范围非常复杂。实际上，您不希望将市政债券、主权评级、公司和结构化融资纳入其中。即使在结构化融资中，您也希望从商业地产中将信用卡单独分开。这是因为评判这些领域的标准、模型和数据是非常不同的，因此对世界IBM公司来说，AAA的相关性与应用于结构化投资工具的AAA是非常不同的。可以说，AAA应该有相同的含义，他们确实试图有相同的含义。但它们是完全不同的问题，就像估计2016年民主党总统当选的概率与在未来50年内全球温度上升1摄氏度的概率。AAA针对的违约率非常低，你无法在实证上校准这些数据，你只能在完全不同的领域中作出最好的估计。
- en: The net result is that when the agencies present their data they exclude various
    securities that are not obvious, leading to selection biases that are parochial
    and difficult to tease out. The exclusions are invariably favorable to the rating
    agencies reputations. I'm sure that, under some definition, the AAA default rate
    for structured securities is 0%. I'm sure using another, it is much higher. One
    thing regulators could do is to define for the agencies how this is calculated.
    Indeed, they should get all ratings data, and performance data, and generate a
    timely report card. That would be something useful and straightforward for our
    legions of regulators to do, and given the special status accorded to ratings
    agencies by the government, not an unreasonable intrusion.

- en: There are many lawsuits in the pipeline, more than the value of the rating agencies.
    It would not be best for the economy to kill Moody's, Fitch, and S&P, because
    new firms would have the same analytical problem they face today, only with less
    institutional experience with a failure that is helpful to have internalized.
    These institutions are very helpful, because without them there would be much
    less liquidity in these obligations, and liquidity helps increase intermediation,
    and getting savings to companies efficiently makes our economy work better.
