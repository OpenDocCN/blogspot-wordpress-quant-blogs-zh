- en: U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin ruled on Wednesday in a 68-page opinion
    that the ratings of certain securities -- those that were distributed to a limited
    number of investors -- don't deserve the same free-speech protection as more general
    ratings of corporate bonds that were widely disseminated.

    websites. It's on IBM's investor relations page. In contrast, some special investment
    vehicles have a rating known to a relatively small number of investors. It's not
    illegal to mention the rating, but really, who cares about such parochial funds.
    The example given was for a $1B fund, but there are about $400B of such funds.

    Moody's is filled with thoughtful, sincere people, who because of their culture,
    have better ethics than your average investment banker. That is, very few people
    who work at Ratings agencies make the kind of money prominent investment bankers
    do, and their steady, salaried work generates more far-sighted thinking. Nonetheless,
    they got caught up like everyone else in assuming that in aggregate, US houses
    can not decline in value, an assumption that drove all the insanity.

    As the judge noted, it's not like they wrote a newspaper article on their opinion,
    but rather, they were paid by a small group of people to deliver a rating delivered
    to a small group of investors. Potentially, there is negligence and bad faith
    involved. If I were the rating agencies, I would argue this was merely a good
    faith error, and highlight how conventional their opinions were by referencing
    contemporaneous statements by academics, regulators, investors, legislators, bankers,
    even Robert Shiller (the famous 'housing bear' whose meek warning highlights how
    common the insanity was). I don't think it is reasonable to legally punish someone
    for holding conventional views, because incorrect conventional views are so common,
    if such errors were actionable we should just turn over corporate revenues to
    the trial lawyers right now. As a practical matter, the scope of damages is too
    large given the historical stupidity of conventional wisdom (busing, new math,
    socialism).

- en: One thing I wish the Agencies were pressed on, is presenting the performance
    of their ratings in a standardized way. Currently, the agencies get to present
    their opinion on their opinions, and this cannot be anything but biased. For example,
    from 1993-2007 (the latest data available), Moody's cumulative 5-year 'impairment'
    rate on Residential Mortgage Backed Securities is 0%; for corporate ratings, the
    5-year 'default' rate 0.09%. As they said in The Princess Bride, I don't think
    those words mean what you think they mean.

    matter, you do not want to include Municipal bonds, with sovereign ratings, corporate,
    and structured finance. Even within structured finance, you want to disaggregate
    credit cards from commercial real estate. This is because the criteria, the model,
    the data, one applies to these areas is very different, so the relevance of a
    AAA for the IBMs of the world, is very different than the AAA applied to Structured
    Investment Vehicles. One might say, an AAA should mean the same thing, and they
    do attempt to mean the same thing. But they are very different problems, like
    estimating the probability Democrats with the presidency in 2016 vs. the probability
    global temperatures rise by 1 degree Celsius over the next 50 years. AAA targeted
    default rates are so low, you can't calibrate these empirically, you just make
    your best estimate in very different domains.

    securities that are not obvious, leading to selection biases that are parochial
    and difficult to tease out. The exclusions are invariably favorable to the rating
    agencies reputations. I'm sure that, under some definition, the AAA default rate
    for structured securities is 0%. I'm sure using another, it is much higher. One
    thing regulators could do is to define for the agencies how this is calculated.
    Indeed, they should get all ratings data, and performance data, and generate a
    timely report card. That would be something useful and straightforward for our
    legions of regulators to do, and given the special status accorded to ratings
    agencies by the government, not an unreasonable intrusion.

    It would not be best for the economy to kill Moody's, Fitch, and S&P, because
    new firms would have the same analytical problem they face today, only with less
    institutional experience with a failure that is helpful to have internalized.
    These institutions are very helpful, because without them there would be much
    less liquidity in these obligations, and liquidity helps increase intermediation,
    and getting savings to companies efficiently makes our economy work better.
