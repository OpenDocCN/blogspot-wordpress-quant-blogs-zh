# Humble Student of the Markets: Rally not confirmed by volume

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2011/10/rally-not-confirmed-by-volume.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2011/10/rally-not-confirmed-by-volume.html#0001-01-01)

As stocks continued to rally into a resistance zone yesterday, the lack of confirmation from volume indicators suggest that resistance is likely to hold. The chart below of SPY shows that this October rally has been a low volume rally. In fact, volume has been so low that yesterday's volume was barely above Monday's Columbus Day semi-holiday volume.

Recall what I wrote

[before](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2011/08/wheres-technical-confirmation.html)

about the William O'Neill technique for spotting confirmation of a bottom:

> [Y]ou’ll want to see a market confirmation.
> 
> That starts when one of the three major indexes begins to rally. That’s day one. Next, wait two days. The market often needs time to digest its initial gains. Make sure the index doesn’t undercut its low. If it does, start counting over again.
> 
> Starting on day four of the cycle, look for a follow-through session. That occurs when the Dow, Nasdaq or S+P 500 jumps at least 2% on higher volume than the previous day. Ideally trade will also exceed its 50-day average. The bigger the price and volume moves, the better.
> 
> The strongest follow-throughs occur between days four and seven of the attempted rally. Follow-throughs after the 10th day become less significant.

We just passed Day 7\. Where's the rally on volume?

**Echoes of 2008?**

I also noticed similar instances of low volume rallies during the Summer of 2008 just before the roof caved in.

While these analogues are useful examples, we also have to remember that history doesn't repeat itself, it rhymes.

The current stock market rally has been sparked by headlines of possible resolutions of the eurozone crisis. The euro has rallied on the news. A glance at the chart of the euro, however, shows that it kissed the underside of two Fibonacci retracement levels.

To reinforce my conviction that the latest bullish impulse is

***not***

sustainable, consider the weekly latest comment published on Monday from Mary Ann Bartels, Chief Technical Analyst at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch [emphasis added]:

> The bulls finally make a stand. Last Tuesday’s low 1075 on the S&P 500 marked a lower volume test of the early August low near 1100 and this is an early sign that the US equity market is trying to form a bottom. This is encouraging, ***but the risk is that the market has not yet seen the explosion in volume that typically comes with a climactic capitulation***. In addition, last Thursday’s and Monday’s 90% up days occurred on lackluster volume. ***This suggests a lack of conviction from the bulls and likely points to short covering, which is not the recipe for a sustainable rally.***

I continue to believe that traders should be fading this rally, not buying into its strength.
