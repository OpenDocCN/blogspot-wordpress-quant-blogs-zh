    Houtem tower tomorrow morning. Jump may work on the network*.” Unfortunately I
    couldn’t make it back to Houtem. But it would’ve been amazing to see contractors
    adding or realigning dishes, or working on equipment. Who knows what they got
    up to on Saturday! While it [appears](http://www.janverfaillie.be/Pers/2013-06-11_HetNieuwsblad.pdf) the
    €5,000,000 Houtem tower was the best deal the Belgium government made in 2013,
    the question of whether the purchase was a good deal for Jump still remains. The
    military [history](https://www.wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1973BRUSSE01930_b.html) of
    these towers prior to their use for HFT is fascinating.

    visiting the same tower at the same time studiously avoided eye contact. A contractor
    working for various competitors complained about “*all of these American guys
    asking for high towers… they just don’t exist!*” Of course, some exist and are
    now used by high-frequency traders. There is this anecdote about Jump: “*They
    were at a structure in Belgium waiting on an authority who controls this structure
    to give them permission. It was taking awhile. So they put a tower on wheels at
    the site. That pissed some people off. But then the tower was moving a lot. So
    they started pouring concrete around the base of the vehicle. The police were
    called out and there were forced to stop*.” I don’t know if it’s true, but it’s
    fun – *se non è vero è bene trovato*. I was also told about a contractor who was
    supposed to install a dish for a firm on a tower already home to another HFT firm’s
    dishes. The workers made a mistake and pointed the new dish toward a tower used

    in the 1960s, but also cover the radios installed on the incredible [Shivering
    Sands Army Forts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shivering_Sands_Army_Fort), which
    were part of the [Maunsell army Forts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maunsell_Forts#Maunsell_army_forts) used
    for anti-aircraft defence during WWII. Thanks to these standing structures, the
    dishes were both more stable and *taller* than those on boats. By squatting in
    the old forts, broadcasters including Screaming Lord Sutch’s Radio City could
    use their height to reach more listeners and thus more revenue via advertising.
    It was all about height.

- en: The most interesting discussion in* The Death of a Pirate, *however, is the
    history of the first radio pirates. They were not pop broadcasters earning cash
    using waves in international waters, but rather people who fiddled with the British
    Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) receivers to listen to non-BBC programmes like
    Radio Normandy. Waves are fruits of nature, to me a common good. When the first
    pirates emerged, states quickly monopolized these fruits and then were obliged
    to sort them. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU), originally founded
    in 1865 as the International Telegraph Convention, was charged with allocating
    waves.In the present, high-frequency traders have to pay state regulators for
    permission to use microwaves. If a firm wants to cross the channel from France to
    England, it has to ask state regulators for frequencies. Since most frequencies
    in the area were already booked or squatted, crossing the channel wasn’t an easy
    task – one competitor had some difficulties to cross the Channel. HFT is hard,
    and pirates may not be dead.

    It’s probably a network provider *à la* Custom Connect, not a prop trading firm.
    I have found them everywhere, from Cornwall to France. One of the anonymous e-mails
    I have received when investigating (yeah, I received anonymous emails!) said: “*Communications
    Infrastructure is a shell with no customers and only licenses to sell to a sucker
    like…*” – stop. Wait a minute. I won’t publish the name of the “*sucker*” yet,
    as the firm will be a guest star of Part IV. But I confirm: Communication Infrastructure asked
    for a lot of licenses in England but I have found no planning application. I even
    doubt they have installed dishes (in France, some of them are “*not activated*”.)
    [UPDATE, 10/06/2014: they have at least one planning application granted, [here](http://pa.midkent.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=documents&keyVal=ZZZVS3KJTA534)
