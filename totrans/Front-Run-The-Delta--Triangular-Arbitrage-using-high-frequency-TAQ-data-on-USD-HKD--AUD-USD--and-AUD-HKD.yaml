    However, there is, to our knowledge, no truly rigorous and robust study of triangular

    the lack of availability of datasets with prices which are sufficiently high-frequency
    and which are also executable."

    data recordings suffer from this issue whereby one variable may be said to have
    "this" price at the last known recorded interval, while the second variable similarly
    has "this" price at the last known recorded interval.  The problem arises because
    the two recorded prices, while they may be the last known price, cannot reliably
    be used due to their differences in time period.  This problem can only be eliminated
    using synchronized data in the most granular form available.

    and live relationship.  The break from parity is caused by an increase in the

    bid-up caused an increase in the bid price of the synthetic AUD/HKD to 7.7154,

    (2009) cite "wider use of electronic trading platforms and trading algorithms"
    from 2003 to 2005 as the main cause of the opportunity's brevity.  They go on
    to note that, "From 2003-2005, the proportion of opportunities lasting less than
    1 second increased from 40% to 62% for the JPY transactions and from 41% to 64%
    for the CHF transactions and the proportion of opportunities lasting in excess
    of 5 seconds halved for both sets of transactions."
