    of seeing the major point, and making a clear argument. Thus, I appreciated this

    his econometric work, and John Cochrane, who is probably one of the 10 best (ie,
    most actively cited) finance professors alive. Heckman noted he was agreeable
    to suggestions they rename the proposed 'Milton Friedman Institute', which, if
    I were giving money, would be a deal breaker, because if you are that ashamed
    of the name 'Milton Friedman', then it is clear the funding will devolve into
    the standard littany of trendy academic pursuits, unrelated to Friedman. Secondly,
    Heckman suggested that the University President was moving the Friedman institute
    too quickly, presumably, dismissing all the leftists in the Chicago Academy who
    see 'free minds and free markets' as a codeword for fascism and repression.

- en: My strong, personal suggestion is that you are digging yourself deeper and deeper
    into public statements that you will regret. Now, not only is Friedman’s name
    expendable, the GSB political, but President Zimmer ’rushed this through.’ He’ll
    be delighted to see that in print. You may have long, convoluted explanations,
    but that won’t do much good when this sort of thing gets out.
