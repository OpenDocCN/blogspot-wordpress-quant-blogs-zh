# VIX and More: Odds and Sods

![](img/97183f3bcd678658370290e14681dbea.png)Friday is always a good time to do some housekeeping, so here are some updates to recent themes in the blog:

In terms of fear, yesterday showed a fair amount of it, as the 25.3% increase in the VIX is about twice the median for a 2.6% drop in the SPX.  While today’s markets seem to have settled down a little after an exciting opening, the elevated fear persists.  For those who may be interested, you can always eyeball today’s VIX and SPX percentage changes on my [fear-complacency graph](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/10/how-fearful-were-we-last-week.html) to make your own assessment.

Now that the Fed [may be done](http://www.clevelandfed.org/research/Policy/fedfunds/index.cfm) cutting rates for the moment (see Mike Shedlock, “[Is it Two and Done?](http://globaleconomicanalysis.blogspot.com/2007/11/rate-cuts-is-it-two-and-done.html)”), the good-news-is-good-news-and-bad-news-is-good-news cycle may be coming to an end as well.  This means we are likely entering a [Rorschach](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rorschach_inkblot_test) cycle, where interpretations of government data start to be largely driven by your view of the investing landscape, in addition to any psychotic disorders that may be lurking just below the surface.

In the [four generals](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/10/four-generals-will-tell-story.html), [four horsemen](http://www.thestreet.com/pf/funds/madmoneywrap/10361041.html), etc. category, the large cap tech leaders continue to do well, while [Southern Copper (PCU)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=pcu&hl=en) has [struggled](http://stockcharts.com/charts/gallery.html?pcu) a bit.  The big story in the group, however, is [MasterCard (MA)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=ma&hl=en), which saw its stock surge 20% after a [blowout earnings](http://www.businessweek.com/investor/content/oct2007/pi20071031_548185.htm?campaign_id=yhoo) report.  Much of MasterCard’s success can be attributed to increased acceptance of plastic across the globe, rather than in the <country-region st="on"><place st="on">US</place></country-region>, where growth is slowing.  In fact, given the doldrums that the [Retail HOLDRS (RTH)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=rth) ETF has been in since July, I will be focusing closely on the many retailers who report earnings just before Thanksgiving.  For some related perspectives, Toro’s Running of the Bulls [argues convincingly](http://runningofthebulls.typepad.com/toros_running_of_the_bull/2007/11/are-the-four-ho.html) that the four horsemen have a lot of room still to run, while Chris Perruna is [following MasterCard closely](http://www.chrisperruna.com/2007/11/02/mastercard-ma-charging-ahead/).

Some quick takes for the VIXophile crowd:
