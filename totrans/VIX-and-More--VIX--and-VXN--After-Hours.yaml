    the day.

    for index options are 9:30 a.m. – 4:15 p.m. ET.

- en: Looking at the earlier period first, during the last 15 minutes of regular trading
    on the NYSE and NASDAQ, high volume program trading often kicks in and includes
    or sometimes triggers a large volume of SPX options trades. These situations are
    relatively easy for retail trader to spot on the tape and are generally consistent
    with sharp moves in the SPX.

- en: The fifteen minutes of index trading following the close of the equities market
    are more often associated with unusual large moves in the VIX. Part of the reason
    for this is the large volume of news that is announced just after the market close.
    Included in these announcements, of course, are earnings reports, such as today’s
    eagerly anticipated report from Google ([GOOG](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/GOOG)).

    estimates for both revenues and earnings, sending the stock up over 2% in the
    15 minute [twilight zone](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/twilight%20zone)
    while index trading was still open.

- en: Google is the second largest component of the [NDX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/NDX)
    (NASDAQ-100), so the obvious place to see Google’s impact on the volatility indices
    is the [VXN](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXN). The chart below,
    courtesy of thinkorswim, shows the VXN during the last 16 minutes of today’s regular
    equities trading session (using my local PT time stamp), as well as during the
    4:00 – 4:15 end of the index trading session. The chart shows the positive surprise
    in Google helped to push VXN down 0.99 (2.1%) in the 15 minutes after the close
    of trading in the NYSE and NASDAQ regular session. Had Google beaten analyst expectations
    by a larger amount – or had a significant miss – I would not have been surprised
    to see the VXN move 5-10% during the twilight zone.
