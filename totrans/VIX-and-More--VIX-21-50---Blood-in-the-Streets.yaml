- en: The intent of this blog is to educate, inform and entertain readers, while also
    serving as an archived learning laboratory of sorts as I try to sharpen my thinking
    in areas such as volatility, market sentiment, and technical analysis. I also
    enjoy charging off on tangents and hope that readers may find some illumination
    or at least amusement in these forays.
