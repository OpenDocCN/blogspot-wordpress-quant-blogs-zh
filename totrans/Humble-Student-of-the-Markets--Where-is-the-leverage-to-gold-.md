# Humble Student of the Markets: Where is the leverage to gold?

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2013/01/where-is-leverage-to-gold.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2013/01/where-is-leverage-to-gold.html#0001-01-01)

Over at Zero Hedge there is a

about how gold and gold stocks are better investments than the stock market and how there is a Wall Street conspiracy to suppress the gold price and keep the "dumb" investors in stocks.

With the Bank of Japan's

 and seemingly to start another round of global competitive currency devaluation, it does certainly make some sense to hold some gold in a portfolio. However, I remain of the opinion that it makes no sense for gold bulls to hold gold stocks over bullion. Consider this chart below of the price of gold compared to the Amex Gold Bugs Index (HUI).

The top panel shows the price of gold in black and HUI in red. The bottom panel shows the HUI/gold ratio. A rising ratio indicates positive leverage to gold and a falling ratio shows falling leverage. The HUI/gold ratio rose and peaked out in late 2003\. It then flattened out and started to decline in 2005 and continues to fall today.

I wrote about this topic in

[2011](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2011/08/stop-buying-gold-stocks.html)

and

[2009](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2009/03/why-gold-bulls-shouldnt-buy-gold-stocks.html)

and it continues to be true:

***Gold bulls shouldn't buy gold stocks!***

The reason why gold stocks have failed to keep pace with the price of bullion is gold mining companies can't replace lost production at the same cost as the older cheaper ore bodies get mined out. They are mining lower and lower grade ore and therefore their profits and cash flows are lower because of higher production costs (see my analysis

[Valuing gold stocks on cash flow, not assets](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2009/03/market-valuing-gold-stocks-on-cash-flow.html)

).

**Bottom line**

: If you are a gold bull, buy physical gold, GLD, CEF, or any other vehicle directly related to the price of gold. Just avoid gold stocks.
