- en: Funny thing that no comments from the owners of the acquired company was made
    in the press release, going against the tradition of each party stroking eachother's
    backs.

- en: This acquisition harkens back to the 2001 buyout of PriceWaterhouse Consulting
    (PWC) by IBM Business Consulting Services (BCS). The consultants of PWC were paid
    about 40% more than the equivalent consultants at BCS. Immediately, many of the
    PWC consultants experienced "downwards salary adjustments". For several years
    after that, the BCS consultants got no merit increases, nor did they get anything
    that resembled a bonus. Many of the best PWC consultants left.

    Finetix paid. (I have been contacted many times by recruiters for product and
    project management positions at Sungard, and the total comp was about 2/3 of the
    Finetix comp.... maybe the technical consulting positions pay better?) It will
    be an interesting next few years for the Finetix employees that decided to stay
    with the new SunGard organization. I know that, when I was hiring for Finetix,
    I received resumes from a number of people who were employed by SunGard. I cannot
    help but see how this cycle will not repeat itself.
