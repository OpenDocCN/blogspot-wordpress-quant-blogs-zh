    of borrowers' homes who were not significantly behind on their payments. But consumer
    advocates stated that didn't matter, because "That homeowners were not delinquent
    has never been our contention," said Rashmi Rangan, a member of the panel and
    the executive director of the Delaware Community Reinvestment Action Council.
    "Our contention is that many of these foreclosures were avoidable."

    borrower in their homes. Heck, why require anyone to pay back their debts, just
    think of the Keynesian stimulus!

    servicing of delinquent loans'. Presumably, given foreclosed loans were found
    to all be truly delinquent, this would merely add more signatures and busy work
    to what is a fact. Somehow, I don't see how adding costs to the intermediation
    process helps anyone, but that's why I'm not in charge.

    The CFPB notes 'servicers fund write-downs (make investors whole)', as if the
    problem with banks is they have too much money. That will really get the economy

    does something this bone-headed right out of the gate, because creating a big
    mess early is probably the best thing they can do. That is, if they did something
    subtle it would probably be worse because it would take longer to fester.
