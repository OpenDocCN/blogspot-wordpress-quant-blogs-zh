- en: ). My friend and colleague Jerry Fons testified, and his theme is that there
    is a conflict of interest inherent in rating agencies is a big problem that underlies
    the lack of due diligence by rating agencies. Indeed, it is a tough problem. An
    important point was a quote from the Moody's CEO, who noted in an internal discussion
    (leaked somehow) that issuers want 'high' ratings, and investors also want 'high
    and stable ratings'. Now, that suggests everyone got exactly what they wanted.
    Of course, the rating agencies then just played along, but if the sellers and
    buyers want AAA ratings, it seems inevitable that AAA ratings would be justified.
    How do you regulate out something where the seller and buyer are willing participants?

- en: One congressman noted that while Baa rated corporate securities had a 2% default
    rate over 5 years, Baa-rated CDO securities had a 24% default rate over 5 years.
    What's up with that? The Moody's CEO mumbled something incoherent about being
    different in different time periods, though he didn't specify which ones. I worked
    on CDOs at Moody's, on the inputs for default rates of unrated securities (RiskCalc(TM)),
    and think the problem was primarily that they underestimated the correlation of
    defaults in bad times. The problem is still there, to my knowledge. But CDO defaults
    are not a big part of this current crisis.

- en: 'Another congressman asked why the ratings for the mortgages started to fall?
    Why should I believe them today, given they missed this huge trend? No good answers
    from the CEOs of the Big Three (Fitch, Moody''s, and S&P). The S&P CEO mentioned
    they did incorporate house price declines of 15% when they underwrote the structures,
    but I think that''s total BS. That is, you can always say ''that assumption is
    in there'', and with a complicated enough process, it is difficult to prove them
    wrong, but I would have followed up with: ''well, what were the loss assumptions
    for subprime versus prime mortgages? How would these have been altered with a
    30% housing price decline? How did these assumptions change over the past 10 years
    as underwriting criteria changed? Where in your ''transparent methodologies''
    is there any record that gives an expected loss estimate for collateral on mortgage
    pools?'''

- en: 'A philosophical question from Eleanor Holmes Norton: if you rate a company
    AAA, and it defaulted, was it accurate or inaccurate? The Fitch CEO said, inaccurate.
    I think the question is incomplete. You are generating a rating that refers to
    a frequency times an expected loss estimate, and an observation contributes to
    that frequency estimate, but no single observation is determinative. However,
    given the AAA estimated default rate of around 1 in 10,000, a single default probably
    doubles the sample default rate, and so gives one great pause.'

  zh: 从埃莉诺·霍姆斯·诺顿提出的一个哲学问题：如果你给一家公司评定AAA级，而它违约了，这个评定是准确还是不准确？惠誉（Fitch）首席执行官表示，不准确。我认为这个问题是不完整的。你正在生成一个评级，它指的是一个频率乘以一个预期的损失估计，而一个观察结果只是为那个频率估计做出贡献，但没有一个单独的观察结果是决定性的。然而，考虑到AAA估计的违约率大约是1/10,000，一个单独的违约可能会使样本违约率翻倍，因此让人深思。
- en: But, while everyone was frustrated, no one seemed to be converging on anything
    to fix the problem. I bet they'll put together some new structure to monitor the
    agencies, that will just be a waste of time, but also get rid of the Nationally
    Recognized Statistical Rating Agency, a designation that gave the Big Three more
    credibility than they deserve.

  zh: 但是，尽管每个人都感到沮丧，似乎没有人在围绕解决问题达成一致。我打赌他们会制定一些新的结构来监督这些机构，那将只是浪费时间，同时废除国家认可的统计评级机构（Nationally
    Recognized Statistical Rating Agency），这个称号给予这三家主要评级机构更多的信誉，而他们其实并不配得到。
