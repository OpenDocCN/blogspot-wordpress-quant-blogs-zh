    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    signal. A bullish Trend Model signal that gets less bullish is a trading "sell"
    signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading
    "buy" signal. The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of
    the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. Past trading of
    the trading model has shown turnover rates of about 200% per month.

    the stock market in 2017 was remarkable. What if I told you that you could have
    had returns with a Sharpe Ratio of 3.2, using the 3-month T-Bill as the risk-free
    rate? As it turns out, you could have achieved that with a simple buy-and-hold
    long position in the SPX, whose Sharpe ratio is the second highest in its history
