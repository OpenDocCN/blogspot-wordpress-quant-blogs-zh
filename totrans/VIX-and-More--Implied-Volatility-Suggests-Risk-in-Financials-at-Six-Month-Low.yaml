    I expressed some concern that the recent relatively weak performance of the financial
    sector ([XLF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLF)) did not bode well
    for any sustainable bull moves.  Perhaps the sector overheard me, as today the
    XLF is up 2% in an otherwise flat market as I type this.

    story than just the prices of the financial stocks.  In particular, I am watching
    the implied volatility of XLF, the financial sector’s [bellwether](http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2008/04/bellwether.html)
    ETF.  As depicted in the chart below, the implied volatility (which has a significant
    fear and anxiety component in it) for XLF is approaching levels not seen since
    the first week in November.

    risk premium in the financial sector is lower than any time in the past six months,
    I am going to listen – and watch to see what happens to the price.
