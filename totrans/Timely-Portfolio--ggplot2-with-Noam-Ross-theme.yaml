    overdispersed infection"](http://www.noamross.net/blog/2013/6/12/multi-infection-overdispersed.html),
    I immediately liked the look of his ggplot2 graphs. I was even more delighted
    when I discovered that he has made his theme available on [github](https://github.com/noamross/noamtools/blob/master/R/theme_nr.R).
    Even though I am all into [rCharts](http://rcharts.io/site), I still love a beautiful
    publication quality R graphic.

    plotting `xts/zoo` objects with ggplot2 easy.

    directly would have allowed us more control over the bothersome details.
