    a nosebleed extreme, such as the NASDAQ Bubble. In bear markets, valuation defines
    the downside risk in equity prices.

- en: As the Powell Fed has signaled it is dead set on a hawkish policy that does
    not preclude inducing a recession, valuation will matter soon. The 10-year Treasury
    yield stands at 2.8% and the S&P 500 forward P/E is 19.0\. The last time the 10-year
    reached these levels was 2028 when the forward P/E traded mostly in a range of
    15-16 but bottomed at a panic low of 13.6\. The previous episode of a similar
    10-year yield was in H2 2013 when the forward P/E was in the range of 13.5-15.

    500\. That's why US equity investors are playing with fire.
