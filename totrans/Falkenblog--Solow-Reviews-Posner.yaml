  zh: 一种新的约束。但索洛做出了一些显然不值得检查的声明：
- en: In the past, 10-to-1 leverage would have been about par for a bank. More recently,
    during the housing bubble that preceded the current crisis, many large financial
    institutions, including now-defunct investment banks such as Bear Stearns and
    Lehman Brothers, reached for 30-to-1 leverage, sometimes even more.
  id: totrans-16

  zh: 在过去，银行的杠杆率本应该是10比1。最近一段时间，在引发当前危机的房地产泡沫期间，包括现已倒闭的熊斯登和雷曼兄弟在内的许多大型金融机构的杠杆率达到了30比1，甚至更高。
- en: 'This canard is not made more plausible by repition. Bear Stearns had 34-to-1
    leverage in 1989, 35 in 1992, 37 in 1997, and 33 in 2007\. Lehman has a similar
    story, with leverage well above 30 throughout the 1990s. It seems high because
    he is conflating investment banks with traditional banks, which generally have
    leverage ratios around 12-to-1, and those have not changed much over the past
    15 years. So the increase in leverage is because of an apples to oranges comparison.
    This fact is simply not true, unless you define leverage using notional derivative
    amounts, but there one would have to offset derivatives, and a lack of transparency
    makes that very difficult. In general, the really high notional amounts are for
    market makers who sold offsetting derivatives, creating a very misleading amount
    of exposure. [tech fact: I''m using TotalAssets/BookEquity as leverage--other
    measures give similar results].'

  zh: 这个谬误不会因为反复而变得更加可信。熊斯登在1989年的杠杆率是34：1，1992年是35：1，1997年是37：1，2007年是33：1。雷曼也有类似的故事，1990年代的绝大部分时间杠杆率都远远超过30。看起来很高，是因为他混淆了投资银行和传统银行，后者通常的杠杆比率大约是12：1左右，过去15年几乎没有变化。因此，杠杆率的增加是因为对苹果和橙子的比较。这个事实非常荒谬，除非你用名义衍生到期金额来定义杠杆率，但是在这方面，人们不得不抵消衍生品，而缺乏透明度使得这一过程非常困难。一般来说，真正高的名义金额是由市场制造商出售对手的衍生品造成的，这给出了一个非常误导性的风险暴露金额。[技术事实：我使用TotalAssets/BookEquity作为杠杆率——其他的度量方法给出了相似的结果。

    complicated derivative securities that seem to bear only the most tenuous connection
    to the everyday economic realities of production, employment, consumption, and
    so on

- en: Consider that the main assets in trouble are all based on mortgages, which are
    linked to home prices. If home prices did not fall, this crisis would not be happening.
    The link between the economy, and the derivatives based on it, could not be more
    direct. Many times people talk about Wall Street as if it competes with the working
    class for economic spoils, but when you look at periods good for workers, they
    were generally good for the stock market, and so too with bad periods (30's and
    70's bad for both, 50's and 90's good for both).

  zh: 请考虑，目前麻烦的主要资产都是建立在房屋抵押贷款基础上的，它们与房屋价格息息相关。如果房价没有下跌，就不会发生这样的危机。经济与基于其上的衍生品之间的联系是再直接不过的了。很多时候人们谈论华尔街的时候，好像它在经济方面与工人阶级争夺经济战利品，但是当你看到对工人有利的时期，它们一般对股市也有利，坏时期也是一样的（30年代和70年代对两者都不好，50年代和90年代对两者都好）。

    and they lost only about 25% in value in 2008, as opposed to the 60% average for
    banks. The bad actors were all heavily regulated by our mishmash of Federal Reserve,
    Treasury, State, and Federal oversight (eg, you need to get a good Community Reinvestment
    Act rating if you want to merge): CountryWide, IndyMac, Wachovia, Washington Mutual,

    IndyMac, Wachovia, Washington Mutual, Lehman, Fannie Mae, Lehman等这些机构受到的监管比经济中工业部门要多得多。
- en: These regulators litigated against lenders who failed to meet targets for serving
    'historically underserved markets' (aka, 'those that can't pay back debts'), and
    Presidents, Congressmen and these same bankers made many speeches together extolling
    the costless benefit of increased home ownership. If you had 10 times more regulators,
    I fail to see these extra government employees telling banks to quit making so
    many NINJA loans because these loans served the objective of increasing home ownership,
    especially to minority communities. Further, traditional lending criteria (like
    a hefty down payment, no teaser rates, income verification) were seen as redlining
    in another guise because as home prices in aggregate had only risen since WW2,
    credit losses for these mortgage innovation were absent empirically, supporting
    the allegation they were arbitrary lending criteria used to keep poor folks down.
    Regulators may not have been necessary nor sufficient for this bubble, but they
    were definitely encouraging it the whole way up.

  zh: 这些监管者起诉那些未能达到“历史上未受关注市场”（又称“无法偿还债务的市场”）服务目标的贷方，总统、国会议员和这些银行家们在一起发表了许多演讲，大肆宣扬增加房屋所有权的无成本好处。如果监管者增加了10倍，我看不出这些额外的政府雇员怎么能命令银行停止发放这么多NINJA贷款，因为这些贷款是为了实现增加房屋所有权的目标，尤其是在少数人群中。此外，如重大头款、无引人入胜的利率、收入验证等传统贷款标准被视为另一种形式的红线，因为自第二次世界大战以来，房价总体上只上涨，这些抵押品创新的信用损失在经验上是不存在的，从而支持了这种指控，即这些标准是为了压制穷人而任意制定的借款标准。监管者可能对这泡沫的产生既非必要且不充分，但他们肯定在整个泡沫膨胀过程中助长了这种情况。
