- en: The first week in November will indeed be momentous and full of wild cards.
    We will see the US mid-term elections, followed by the FOMC meeting in which QE2
    is expected to be announced. Right now, the market consensus for both events are
    both equity bullish. However, it's important to examine the implications of these
    events to see if they are indeed bullish.

    The market is pricing in about $1 trillion in QE2, while signals from the Fed
    is that it will be substantially less, with room for "flexibility" to raise the
    program if necessary. This, to me, seems to be a recipe for disappointment.

  zh: 并指出QE2可能意味着布雷顿森林2号的终结。市场预计QE2将达到约1万亿美元，而美联储的信号是它将远远少于这个数字，有“灵活性”在必要时提高该计划的规模。对我来说，这似乎是一个让人失望的配方。

    seemingly oblivious to the historical errors of Japanese fiscal policy, not to
    mention the US experience in the Great Depression. ***For better or worse, that

    they are poised to deliver far less than necessary to meet expectations, expectations
    that already were likely overly optimistic.

- en: To be sure, Fed policymakers will argue that they are trying to preserve flexibility.
    Why is it that "flexibility" means the ability to scale up? Why can't "flexibility"
    mean the ability to scale down? Seriously, it is not as if the Fed is in any danger
    of hitting either of the objectives in the dual mandate anytime soon. And does
    Bernanke really believe that it will be any easier to offer a credible commitment
    to scale up once Dallas Federal Reserve Chairman Richard Fisher is a voting member
    of the FOMC?

  zh: 可以肯定，美联储的政策制定者将争辩说他们正在努力保持灵活性。为什么“灵活性”意味着扩大规模的能力？为什么“灵活性”不能意味着缩小规模的能力？认真地说，美联储并没有很快达到双目标中的任何一个目标的危险。那么，伯南克真的相信一旦达拉斯联邦储备银行行长理查德·费舍尔成为联邦公开市场委员会（FOMC）的投票成员，提供扩大规模的可信承诺会更容易吗？
