    We will see the US mid-term elections, followed by the FOMC meeting in which QE2
    is expected to be announced. Right now, the market consensus for both events are
    both equity bullish. However, it's important to examine the implications of these
    events to see if they are indeed bullish.

    The market is pricing in about $1 trillion in QE2, while signals from the Fed
    is that it will be substantially less, with room for "flexibility" to raise the
    program if necessary. This, to me, seems to be a recipe for disappointment.

    seemingly oblivious to the historical errors of Japanese fiscal policy, not to
    mention the US experience in the Great Depression. ***For better or worse, that
    leaves monetary policy to bear the burden.*** But the Federal Reserve is signaling
    they are poised to deliver far less than necessary to meet expectations, expectations
    that already were likely overly optimistic.

    Why is it that "flexibility" means the ability to scale up? Why can't "flexibility"
    mean the ability to scale down? Seriously, it is not as if the Fed is in any danger
    of hitting either of the objectives in the dual mandate anytime soon. And does
    Bernanke really believe that it will be any easier to offer a credible commitment
    to scale up once Dallas Federal Reserve Chairman Richard Fisher is a voting member
    of the FOMC?
