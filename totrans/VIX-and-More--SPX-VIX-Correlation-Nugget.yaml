    laid out some of my thinking on the significance of the correlation.  I think
    the title says it all: “[High Positive Correlation Between VIX and SPX Often Signals
    Market Weakness](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/05/high-positive-correlation-between-vix.html).”'

- en: There is also the issue of recent correlation data.  For the past week and a
    half or so, the SPX and VIX have had an unusually high positive correlation, at
    least relative to historical data.  In fact, the last time the SPX and VIX showed
    correlation levels this high for several days running it was…February 22, 2007,
    just three days before the largest VIX spike since the CBOE began tracking the
    VIX in 1990.  Now before anyone jumps to conclusions, none of the eight previous
    correlation ‘spikes’ of comparable magnitude from the current decade resulted
    in a significant move in the SPX, so the historical record has to be considered
    ambiguous at best in the current environment.
