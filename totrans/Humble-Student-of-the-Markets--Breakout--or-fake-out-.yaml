    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    signal. A bullish Trend Model signal that gets less bullish is a trading "sell"
    signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading
    "buy" signal. The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of
    the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. Past trading of
    the trading model has shown turnover rates of about 200% per month.

    surprise from the Employment Report. The upside breakout followed a false breakdown
    out of a narrow trading during the same week. The key question for traders is,
    "Is this an honest-to-goodness breakout, or just a fake out?"

    for the past few weeks about how the combination of overly defensively oriented
    investors and a US growth surprise is leading to a FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)
    rally in US equities. Now it seems that the growth surprise is spreading around
    the world. As the chart below shows, the Global Purchasing Managers Index (PMI)
    is turning up, which is a positive sign for global growth.
