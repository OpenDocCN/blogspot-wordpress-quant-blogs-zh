    I have the investments all figured out.  Unfortunately, that is not the case,
    and I will resume more standard investment and systems posts soon.  I did want
    to share what I think are two more beautiful Growth of a $1 visualizations.  Although
    my lattice code is far from tight, I think the result is fairly good using and
    modifying some of the Economist style graphs offered in latticeExtra.

    also look very similar.  I will let you choose your favorite.  However, the lattice
    version will much more likely appear in my reports.
