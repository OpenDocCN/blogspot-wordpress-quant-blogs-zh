# VIX and More: JunkDEX Falls 11% in First Two Hours of Trading

I was not expecting to talk about the [JunkDEX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/JunkDEX) for the third day in a row, but since I have received several requests, I will run with this theme for another day.

Today the JunkDEX is showing an acceleration of yesterday’s 7.2% move downward. As of 11:30 ET, the JunkDEX is down a little more than 11%, with American International Group ([AIG](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/AIG)), Fannie Mae ([FNM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/FNM)) and CIT Group ([CIT](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/CIT)) all down about 15% each.

Based on the large trading volumes, Sunday’s call of an impending blow-off top is looking as if it may be coming to fruition.
