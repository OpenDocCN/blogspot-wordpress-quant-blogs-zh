    we acquire before the age 18\. I think that's pretty correct. Most people don't
    change their minds on big issues during their working lives, though they may acknowledge
    certain tactics within their grand theory are not fruitful.

    supposedly proved General Relativity was correct. While one discussant mentioned
    that the experiment had higher standard error than could have proved this, the
    next discussant said all measurement issues were addressed appropriately, and
    that claims Eddington engaged in fraud are pure myth. In the end, one discussant
    states, this is how real science is done: testing theories against reality.'

- en: I agree this is how real science is done, but contra the discussant, it was
    a bogus confirmation of Einstein's theory, tendentious cherry picking of what
    to leave in, what to leave out. The fact that the theory was correct does not
    change this, and it's very tempting to use hindsight to give the scientists involved
    the benefit of the doubt, especially when something is generally accepted. Deferral
    to conventional wisdom has some logic to it, but when you look at the past and
    note how many important beliefs were clearly untrue, there are probably many common
    scientific beliefs today that are untrue (unless somehow now we finally have everything
    right).

- en: To recap the issue, in 1919, Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity was only
    a few years old, yet academics were eager to put the nightmare of World War I
    behind them and show the common bond of the old adversaries. Proving the German’s
    theory correct was greatly desired by scientists who rightly saw the conflict
    as simply madness. The null hypothesis, set up by standard Newtonian Physics,
    was that there should be a 0.85 arc-second deflection in light from stars behind
    the sun, while Einstein predicted a 1.7 arc-second deflection.

    to mend the rift between German and English academics. He made a trek to the island
    of Principe, off the coast of West Africa, one of the best locations for observing
    the eclipse. He used a series of complex calculations to extract the deflection
    estimate from the data and came up with an estimate of 1.6 arc-seconds. Data from
    two spots in Brazil from that same eclipse were 1.98 and 0.86, but Eddington

- en: In 10 further eclipses from 1922 to 1952 only one of these produced seemingly
    high-quality data, and in that case generated results much greater than Einstein
    predicted. In 1962, an English team tried to redo the experiment given a similar
    eclipse and methodology but newer equipment, and they found they could not. The
    tools and the event were simply too primitive to allow the kind of accuracy needed
    to prove general relativity via this experiment at that time. Eddington's dismissal
    of observations that would have lowered the key measurement's mean and increased
    its standard error used an objection that could just as easily been applied to
    the measurements he kept. In the late 1960s, using radio frequencies as opposed
    to pictures from an eclipse, Eddington’s results were confirmed, but that does
    not make that initial experiment good empirical research.

    achievement, yet it was tendentious empirical work. Science is filled with fraud
    behind correct results: Mendel fudged his numbers, Pasteur was hardly fair to
    his critics. A great deal of science is motivated by confabulation, generating
    evidence for prejudices. In that sense scientists are little different than most
    professions, where one has ideals vs. reality. Lawyers aren''t primarily interested
    in justice, teachers aren''t primarily interested in children, even ''the best''.
    After all, unlike judges, most scientists have a rooting interest for whatever
    theory they are proposing, they want to be the founding father of some branch
    of knowledge. Those of us merely judging, meanwhile, are choosing between two
    choices, and as we don''t have any skin in the game, we want the truth because
    that''s what''s helpful.'
