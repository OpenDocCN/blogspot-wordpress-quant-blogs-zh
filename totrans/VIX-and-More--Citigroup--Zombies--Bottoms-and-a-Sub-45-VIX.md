# VIX and More: Citigroup, Zombies, Bottoms and a Sub-45 VIX

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/03/citigroup-zombies-bottoms-and-sub-45.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/03/citigroup-zombies-bottoms-and-sub-45.html#0001-01-01)

Two hours into today’s session and a 4% rally in the SPX seems to be holding – at least for now.

One of the catalysts for the rally was a comment made by Citigroup ([C](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/C)) CEO Vikram Pandit in a letter to employees that confirmed the bank made an operating profit in the first two months of 2009 and is on a trajectory to record the best quarter since Q3 2007 – the last time the bank booked a quarterly profit.

So…all of a sudden we have Citigroup looking profitable (for a stretch – and only on an operating basis), the possibility that [zombie banks](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/zombie%20bank) might be able to earn their way back to the land of the living (see my [January comments](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/01/voodoo-and-solvency-krugman-vs-hempton.html) about John Hempton’s analysis of this situation) and a devil’s bottom, where last week’s SPX 666 mark now appears as if it may hold up for at least a little while.

The risk/reward profile of the market may now be turning around, especially when Nouriel Roubini [comments](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&sid=a0oeKmwfkr9k&refer=us), “My main scenario is that it’s highly likely [the SPX] goes to 600 or below...500 is less likely, but there is some possibility you get there.”

After 13 of 16 down days for the SPX, it was only a matter of time before even several pieces of good news randomly clustered together to produce a bullish bounds, but…will it last?

As for the VIX, which is now hovering at the 45 level, the one day bounce does alleviate some short-term fears. The big change in the VIX is not due to technical support levels in the SPX, however, but to the changing macroeconomic landscape, where there is a glimmer of hope on the horizon for the first time since what seems like just a little bit after the invention of the ATM. While VIX is sensitive to technical trends in the markets, ultimately it is a product of macroeconomic and fundamental uncertainty. As the list of possible future universes gets culled down to a manageable, believable and ultimately palatable number, a sub-45 VIX will once again become the norm.
