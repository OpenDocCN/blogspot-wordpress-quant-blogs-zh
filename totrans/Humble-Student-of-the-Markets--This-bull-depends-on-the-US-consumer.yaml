    decisively broken through the 13K mark, the NASDAQ Composite is through 3,000
    and the SPX has rallied above 1,400\. Positive momentum was confirmed by overseas
    markets such as the European markets, which also staged upside breakouts through
    technical resistance. It turns out I was right, but for the wrong reasons.

- en: What's been surprising to me is the nature of the leadership in this rally.
    This rally was underpinned by global central bank liquidity. The BoJ, BoE, ECB
    and the Fed have all undertaken some form of quantitative easing and the flood
    of liquidity usually buoys asset inflationary expectations, which leads to rallies
    in commodities, cyclicals and high beta growth groups such as emerging markets.
    This time, the leadership in equities has not been in those sectors, but something
    more unusual.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Consider where the leadership has come from in this rally. First of all, the
    usual defensive sectors such as Utilities and Consumer Staples are lagging (not
    shown). Next, we see a turnaround in Financials, which is consistent with the
    narrow miss from a global financial meltdown from the eurozone crisis. The chart
    below shows the relative performance of Financials against the market. The sector
    has turned around and staged an upside relative breakout, which is not surprising
    under the circumstances.
