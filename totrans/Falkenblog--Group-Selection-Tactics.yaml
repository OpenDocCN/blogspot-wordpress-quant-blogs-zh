    of coalitions, and of the conflict between individual and group incentives (eg,
    Wilson, Haidt).  I found Putin''s recent top appointment a good example of how

  zh: 近期工作强调群体选择的重要性，突出了联盟的作用以及个体与群体激励之间的冲突（例如，Wilson, Haidt）。我发现普京最近的最高任命是一个很好的例子，说明了成功如何受到运气和混合动机的影响：
- en: 'Mr. Putin’s first high-level appointment as president was Igor R. Kholmanskikh,
    42, a tank-factory worker from the Urals who is famous for one thing: offering
    to travel to Moscow with a gang of assembly-line workers to chase antigovernment
    protesters off the streets.'

  zh: 普京先生作为总统的首次高层任命是42岁的伊戈尔·R·霍尔曼斯基赫，一位来自乌拉尔的坦克工厂工人，他因一件事而出名：提出带领一群装配线工人前往莫斯科，将反政府抗议者赶出街头。
- en: Guys like this need to understand their success depends largely on understanding
    the importance of being restrained and deferential when being used, quietly acquiring
    trust from others until eventually going it on your own. Kind of like how Putin's
    grandfather, Stalin's chef, probably bit his tongue quite a bit and it paid off
    eventually. Patience is key. The process is well described in

  zh: 像这样的人需要明白，他们的成功很大程度上取决于理解在被利用时保持克制和顺从的重要性，悄悄地从他人那里获得信任，直到最终独立行动。有点像普京的祖父，斯大林的厨师，可能经常忍气吞声，最终得到了回报。耐心是关键。这一过程在《

    during his rise to power, always eager to get face time with those above him,
    and acting like an adoring young pup, but when he became president he was an obnoxious,
    rude bully to those under him.

  zh: 约翰逊总统崛起的概述。约翰逊在崛起过程中是一个谄媚的马屁精，总是急于与上级见面，表现得像一个崇拜的小狗，但当他成为总统时，他对下属却是一个令人讨厌、粗鲁的暴君。
- en: I know a lot of guys in business who became executives this way.  Invariably,
    they rarely spoke extemporaneously, had little understanding of the business and
    were quite defensive around people who liked to 'talk shop', but were masters
    at managing relations with others and forming bonds with the right people.

  zh: 我知道很多商界人士就是这样成为高管的。他们通常很少即兴发言，对业务了解甚少，在喜欢“谈业务”的人周围相当防御，但在管理与其他人的关系以及与正确的人建立联系方面却是高手。
