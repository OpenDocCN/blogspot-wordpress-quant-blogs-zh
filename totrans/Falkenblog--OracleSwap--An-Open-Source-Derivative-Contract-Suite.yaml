    I soon discovered that as a registered US firm my options were severely limited.
    I could go long or short a handful of crypto names over-the-counter, but they
    had excessive funding rates for going long *and* short (eg, >12%), and required
    100% margin; I could short bitcoin at the CBOE, but I had to put up five times
    the notional as collateral. No reasonable estimate of alpha can overcome such
    costs. To use popular exchanges like Deribit or BitMEX would require lying about
    my domicile which would violate US regulations related to investment advisors,
    and also diminishes my legal rights if such an exchange decided to simply not
    give me my money back.So I thought, why not create my own derivatives contract?
    Ethereum gives users the ability to create simple contracts, and nothing is more
    straightforward than a futures contract. I figured I could create a contract where
    the money at risk would be small relative to the notional, and its oracle would
    be honest because of the present value of this repeated game. The basic idea was
    simple enough, but the details are important and difficult, which turned this
    into a 2-year trip (I have sincere empathy for Ethereum''s development pace).Many
    initial crypto enthusiasts were motivated by the belief that our traditional financial
    system was corrupted by bailouts and greed. Ironically, the standard floundering
    blockchain dapp is constrained by their earlier short-sighted greed. Enterprising
    capitalists discovered that if you sell tokens, you can propose a vague blockchain
    business model and people will think it will be just like bitcoin, only it would
    offer [insurance](https://etherisc.com/), [porn](https://www.coindesk.com/spankchain-launches-crypto-payments-service-for-adult-content),
    or [dentistry](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dentacoin/). This required
    corporate structures because even in 2017 no one was gullible enough to invest
    in a token that funded an individual. Supposedly, the token is for use *and* decentralized
    governance, the latter implying all of the desirable bitcoin properties: transparency,
    immutability, pseudonymity, confiscation-proof, and permissionless access. Yet
    consensus algorithms are much easier to apply to blockchains than cases where
    essential information exists off the blockchain; non-blockchain consensus mechanisms
    do not generate all of those desirable bitcoin properties because they are much
    easier to game.   Decentralization is a good thing, but like democracy, not at
    every level. A nation of purely independent contractors would never have developed
    the technology we have today, as things like computer chips and airplanes require
    hierarchal organization, and hierarchies need centralization. To relegate a market
    to atomistic, anonymous participants implies either an intolerable base level
    of fraud or costly adjudication mechanisms that jeopardize security and delay
    payments. A free market is built on a decentralized economy, which is based on
    free entry by firms and free choice by consumers. The degree of centralization
    within those firms is particular to a market, some of which should be large (e.g.,
    banks).The [Coase Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coase_theorem) highlights
    that the optimal amount of vertical integration depended on transaction costs
    related to information, bargaining, and enforcement. This is why firm size varies
    depending on the product. Naïve types think that we should just have small businesses
    because then we would have no oppression from businesses wielding market power.
    Given our current level of technology, that implies mass starvation. The naïve
    extension is that we should have large firms, but they should be zealously regulated
    by selfless technocrats. This ignores the universal nature of regulators, who
    protect existing firms under the pretext of protecting the consumer. This latter
    point is especially relevant as most protocols have some ability to permission
    access, and regulators will hold them accountable. Large institutions do not like
    competition, and governments do not like complete independence among their subjects,
    resulting in either KYC or curiosities like trading CryptoKitties.  The alternative
    I present is based on the idea that decentralization is basically competition,
    and that dapps can simply inherit the essential bitcoin properties by being on
    the blockchain without tokens and avoid convoluted consensus algorithms. That
    makes it cheaper and easier to design a viable product. A pseudonymous ethereum
    account allows oracles to develop a reputation because its actions are transparent
    and immutable; outsiders cannot censor it. Lower costs, crypto-security, and pemissionless
    access, provides a valuable way for people to lever, short, and hedge various
    assets: the initial contract has derivatives on ETHUSD, BTCUSD, and the S&P500.The
    result is [OracleSwap](http://oracleswap.co/), an ethereum derivatives contract
    suite. I have a working version on the web, at oracleswap.co. While it is live
    on the Ethereum Main Network, it is restricted to margins of 1 or 2 szabo, which
    even with leverage is well under $0.01 in notional value. It is meant to provide
    an example. I would be an oracle and liquidity provider myself, but as a middle-aged
    American, that is not practical. I have fingerprints all over this thing and my
    friends tend to have good jobs in the highly regulated financial sector, and we
    would have a lot to lose by violating US regulations (e.g., CFTC SEF regulations
    within Dodd-Frank, FinCEN, BSA). Yet there are many who can and do invest in exchanges
    prohibited to US investors, and such investors need better choices.'

- en: Many competent programmers have the ability and resources to modify and administer
    such a contract (you can rent server space for $10/month). The oracle is honest
    because the present value of oracle revenue is an order of magnitude greater than
    a cheat. Further, the oracle has economies of scale, so those who are disciplined
    can create a working product, and by the time they graduate, they will have generated
    a couple-year track record supplying timely and accurate data.

- en: 'Several innovations make this work, all focused on radical simplicity. This
    lowers costs and reduces direct and indirect costs. The most important innovations
    are the following:  · **Forward-starting prices** Trades are transacted at the
    next-business-day closing price. As this contract targets long-term investors,
    the standard errors generated by differences in various 4 PM ET prices are minimal
    and unbiased (the median of several sources over different intervals within a
    5-minute window for crypto, the SPX uses the close price). As an institutional
    investor, I always used next-day VWAP prices. Limit order books generate many
    complications, and provide nothing of interest to long term investors; day trading
    blockchain assets is predicated on delusion. The key to market-making capital
    efficiency is allowing the liquidity provider to net trades. Without a token,
    this had to be done through netting exposures at the weekly settlement. The LP''s
    are basically mini-exchanges, in that long and short positions are netted. Weekly
    settlement can handle 200 positions in a single function call, but this can be
    broken up into 200-unit chunks, allowing an almost unlimited set of positions
    for any LP. They balance long and short demand by adjusting their long and short
    funding rates. The Law of Large Numbers implies larger LPs will have more balanced
    books, allowing them to generate a higher gross-to-net asset ratio, which implies
    higher returns for a given level of risk and capital; LPs are incented by economies
    of scale, not delusional token appreciation.  This contract is designed for those
    who want to stay off the grid, and so its pseudonymous oracle can maintain its
    anonymity and avoid censorship. Its main costs are fixed, as once the contract,
    front-end, and automated scripts for updating prices are created, maintenance
    is trivial. The oracle is kept honest via the repeated game it is playing, and
    the ability and incentive for users to burn their PNL rather than submit to a
    fraudulent PNL at settlement. A centralized oracle is much easier to incentivize
    because it is all-in on the brand value of its oracle contract, as a cheat should
    eliminate future users.'

- en: the only way to cheat involves colluding with an oracle that posts fraudulent
    prices, so the contract focuses on minimizing a cheat payoff while concentrating
    the cheat cost on the oracle. An oracle's reputation is black or white, as its
    history of reported prices is easy to monitor, and no rational person would ever
    use an oracle that cheated once. All of an oracle's brand value is in the contract
    due to its pseudonymous nature, so there is less incentive to sell-out to seize
    or protect some traditional brand value (e.g., Steem). While explaining the incentive
    structure requires more space than I have here, the crucial issues are that players
    have the ability and the will to decimate a cheat.

- en: Not only are the ethereum contracts open source, but the web3.js front end is
    as well. By downloading the web front-end users can eliminate the risk that someone
    is watching their interactions with the identical front-end hosted at oracleswap.co.
    Yet, it is mainly a template for developers. I hired people to create the basic
    structures as I am not a hard-core programmer, but I have modified them endlessly
    and in the process had to learn a lot about [Drizzle/React](https://www.trufflesuite.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-drizzle-and-react),
    JavaScript, Python, and Solidity.

    the contract. This has to be automated with error-checking processes and redundancies. You
    can send questions related to this contract to ericf@efalken.com. I can't promise
    I'll respond, but I'll try.

    denominated in szabo, and the website and contract do not ask for no user information
    such as emails, etc, users can interact via MetaMask or MyCrypto.com without worry.
    Users can also download the front-end from GitHub and run a local version with
    all the same functionality (it's open source). It is fully functional.
