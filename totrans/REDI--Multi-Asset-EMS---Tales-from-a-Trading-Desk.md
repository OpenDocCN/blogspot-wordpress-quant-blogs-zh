## REDI: Multi-Asset EMS

Wall Street & Technology has the [latest](http://www.wallstreetandtech.com/electronic-trading/goldmans-redi-spin-off-signals-ems-marke/240158521?pgno=1) update on REDI following its February 2012 [article.](http://www.wallstreetandtech.com/electronic-trading/goldman-sachs-to-spin-off-redi-tech-grou/232600489)  Of interest:

*   “application service provider (ASP) model”
*   “installed on the client side is the front end and the desktop client software”
*   “buy-side firms have increasingly expressed a preference for broker-neutral systems as opposed to single-dealer systems”
*   “could also be a sign that developing multi-asset EMSs is too costly for brokers”
*   ‘could add on the order management piece used by portfolio managers” – finally a workable [OEMS](http://www.advancedtrading.com/ems-oms/market-structure-drives-the-buy-side-to/240155239)?
