    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    "buy" signal. The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of
    the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. Past trading of
    the trading model has shown turnover rates of about 200% per month.

    panic selling, tops are processes, which are the result of a series of connected
    episodes that depress prices. In the past few months, I have adopted the belief
    that the market is undergoing a topping process. Consequently, I become increasingly
    cautious about the stock market, though I do not believe that the ultimate top
    has been seen yet.
