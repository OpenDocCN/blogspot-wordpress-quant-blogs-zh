    I looked at what happens to the VIX leading up to and following a 3% drop in the
    SPX. Turning to the VIX in the five days before and after a 3% rise in the SPX,
    the composite visual of these 26 data points is much less compelling:'

- en: I previously noted that while the VIX surging an average of 10% in the four
    days prior to the SPX drop might have put some on notice that fireworks could
    be on the horizon, given the VIX's beta of -7 to -8, there were enough 'false
    alarm' 10% moves in four days to make this a weak predictive signal. Looking the
    VIX in the five days before and after a 3% rise in the SPX, any predictive value
    in a VIX move is much weaker, on the order of 5% on average during the three days
    prior to the 3% VIX jump.

    rise in the VIX only moved the VIX down 9.7%, on average

    drop, when the SPX jumped 3%, the VIX was below the -9.7% drop and still moving
    lower four and five days after the SPX move

    future posts here, but for now I will conclude by puting forth the following working
    hypothesis:'

- en: the widely accepted belief that the VIX generally reverts to the mean is more
    valid for sharp VIX moves up than sharp VIX moves down.
