# Humble Student of the Markets: From oversold to overbought to...

**Mid-week market update**

: In my last post, I suggested that the stock market is headed for a corrective period, though a short-term bounce was possible this week because of its oversold condition (see

[Correction ahead: Momentum is dying](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2019/03/10/correction-ahead-momentum-is-dying/)

). The market has staged a remarkable recovery this week by surging to test a key resistance level and readings are now overbought.

The key question then becomes, "Is the correction thesis dead?"
