    a liberal's ugly tendencies are revealed, specifically, the desire for top-down
    power. Read this positive spin on the current crisis with this

    give the new administration extraordinary leverage over the national economy.
    Suppose the new CEO of AIG decided he didn't want to insure assets of companies
    whose executives make unseemly multiples of the national median income? There
    are all kinds of crazy things you could do. And of course not all of them woul
    dbe good ideas. But some of them would! And the smart folks on our side need to
    be figuring out which ones they are. It seems doubtful to me that a progressive
    administration would ever be able to get away with this much nationalizing of
    everything, but what's done is done and I think it creates a real opportunity
    for "socially conscious insurance underwriting" or whatever you care to call it.

    those becoming fabulously powerful do it out of love for the worker and have modest
    salaries. You never heard about recessions or financial panics in Russia, even
    in the 1930's when millions of Americans were out of work while every Russian
    was occupied in some way. Further, just think about how awesome the world would
    be if disinterested smart people could make all the decisions! Regular people
    are so dumb. I don't see how it could go wrong.
