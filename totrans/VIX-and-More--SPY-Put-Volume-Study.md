# VIX and More: SPY Put Volume Study

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/06/spy-put-volume-study.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/06/spy-put-volume-study.html#0001-01-01)

For those who were underwhelmed by [yesterday’s monthly charts](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/06/vix-put-to-call-ratios-and-call-option.html) of the call volume and [put to call ratios](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/put%20to%20call) for the VIX, I am going to try to whelm you a little more by switching over to weekly charts of [SPY](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SPY) (the ETF for the S&P 500 index) puts.

The logic here is that those who may not want to be short the market (or hedge long positions) with the additional leverage of [VIX calls](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20calls) may prefer the [increased liquidity](http://biz.yahoo.com/opt/stat1.html), dollar strike price increments, and [penny pricing](http://www.888options.com/help/faq/general.jsp?prt=nyse#26) benefits of SPY puts.

Looking at the chart below, the SPY put volume correlates nicely with intermediate bottoms in the SPX/SPY.  Note the current spike in put volume. It is something to think about, anyway, as you contemplate what the Fed could possibly say that might put a stop to the slide in the equities market.
