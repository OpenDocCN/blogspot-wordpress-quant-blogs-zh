- en: This paper examines the frequency of violent death and regicide amongst 1,513
    monarchs in 45 monarchies across Europe between AD 600 and 1800\. The analyses
    reveal that all types of violence combined account for about 22 per cent of all
    deaths. Murder is by far the most important violent cause of death, accounting
    for about 15 per cent of all deaths and corresponding to a homicide rate of about
    1,000 per 100,000 ruler-years.

    murder a King to take his spot, your probability of being killed is above trend.
    Thus, to commit regicide puts you in the rarefied air 10 times that of the most
    murderous environs on the planet.

    courage, demonstrated most recently when young Prince Harry eagerly signed up
    for dangerous missions in Afghanistan, and has the benefit of merely being a function
    of will. Modern warfare and information technology has made such bravery as irrelevant
    and absurd as it should be for determining our class structure.
