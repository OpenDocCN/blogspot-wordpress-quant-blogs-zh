- en: The development of CVI+ was based on logic and observation. When I first started
    discretionary trading, I looked for breakouts from congestion ranges. I had a
    great deal of success with that strategy across a variety of instruments including
    stocks, commodities and currencies. I wasn’t looking at bases in the classical
    IBD sense, often i was simply looking at 2-3 week congestion periods regardless
    of where they occured within the 52-week range. I had no idea what backtests were
    at the time, and I simply traded this way because I read that a lot of traders
    had success doing it.

  zh: CVI+的开发基于逻辑和观察。当我开始裁量交易时，我寻找从拥挤区间中突破的机会。我在包括股票、商品和货币在内的各种工具上都取得了巨大的成功。我并不是按照经典的IBD概念来看基础，我经常只是看2-3周的拥挤期，而不管它们发生在52周范围内的哪里。那时候我不知道什么是回测，我之所以以这种方式交易，只是因为我读到很多交易员都这样成功地交易。
- en: Fast-forward years later as a quant, and  system developer one of the most pressing
    problems of the day is to determine whether a given move will mean-revert or follow
    through. After developing the DV2 and other mean-reversion indicators, I wanted
    to figure out when they would be less likely to work. Even though I trade primarily
    using computers, and no longer look at charts, I noticed upon reviewing some losing
    trades that they occured under some of the same conditions under which I would
    have taken an opposite position as a discretionary trader. That is, in recent
    times I was often fading tight breakouts from congestion ranges. So I decided
    to create an indicator that captured such a setup.

  zh: 经过多年作为量化交易员和系统开发者的发展，当今最紧迫的问题之一是确定给定的走势是回归均值还是持续。在开发了DV2和其他回归均值指标之后，我想弄清楚它们何时可能不起作用。尽管我主要使用计算机进行交易，不再查看图表，但我注意到在回顾一些失败的交易时，它们发生在我作为裁量交易员可能采取相反立场的一些相同条件下。也就是说，最近我经常在拥挤区间的紧密突破中逆势操作。因此，我决定创建一个能够捕捉这种设置的指标。

  zh: 这是我想要纳入的两个主要概念：
- en: 1) 10-day volatility including intraday ranges

  zh: 1) 10天内包括盘中波动范围的波动率
- en: 2) some sort of breakout via the open vs yesterday’s close, the close today
    vs yesterday’s high or the close vs yesterday’s close

  zh: 2) 通过开盘价与昨日收盘价之间的某种突破、今日收盘价与昨日最高价之间的某种突破，或者收盘价与昨日收盘价之间的某种突破
- en: While the calculation is proprietary, as a guideline you would normalize the
    volatility from 0 to 1 and subtract that number from one and average it with a
    normalized measure of the breakout . The resulting indicator CVI+ranges from 0
    to 1 with levels above .5 indicating expected trending behavior on the long side,
    and levels below .5 indicating expected mean-reverting behaviour. Testing this
    indicator across a variety of instruments including stocks, commodities, currencies
    and indices, shows that it is robust, and does in fact differentiate trending
    from countertrend behaviour. I will present some results shortly.

  zh: 尽管计算是专有的，作为指导，您将从0到1标准化波动性，并从中减去该数字，然后将其与一种标准化的突破测量平均。由此产生的指标CVI+范围从0到1，其中水平超过0.5表示在多头方向上预期趋势行为，而水平低于0.5表示预期回归均值行为。对包括股票、商品、货币和指数在内的各种工具进行此指标的测试表明，它是稳健的，并确实区分了趋势与反趋势行为。我将很快展示一些结果。
