    foreign reserves are just 14 years old phenomenon but the results have been and
    will be profound.  The buying started after the Asia Pacific collapse of 1997,
    and the Asian central banks chose to continuously engage a different form of quantitative
    easing that far exceeds Bernanke’s QE1 and QE2\. Remember Greenspan’s “Conundrum”
    and the inability of Fed rate increases to push the long end of the curve higher. 
    Those artificially restrained rates persuaded money managers and institutions
    to seek higher returns in new products like CDOs and motivated additional housing
    demand from the US consumer.  These were both significant factors in the 2008
    collapse.

    the cyclicality of the economy.  When nonmarket forces inhibit the normal functioning
    of interest rates, significant macro imbalances can cause severe consequences. 
    Unfortunately, it seems we still have not learned our lesson.

    political debate gives an illusion of control to our inept politicians and causes
    us to forget that the market, primarily Asian central bank buyers, determines
    the limits of US fiscal and monetary policy.  I can only hope that somehow the
    US can maintain the very tenuous confidence we take for granted.
