    product team who’s role is to drive the planning and design process for C# (and
    now also F#). Hopefully these blog postings and general input from the F# community
    will help to transform F# into a real product and provide fully integrate into
    Visual Studio with the same quality and support obligations Microsoft has with
    other languages.
