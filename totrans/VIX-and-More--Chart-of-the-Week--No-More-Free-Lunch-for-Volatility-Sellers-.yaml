- en: One month ago the VIX closed at a 2009 record low of 20.69, so it should not
    be a big surprise that [realized volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/realized%20volatility)
    over the course of the past month has been higher than predicted by the VIX. What
    I find interesting about this development is that last week was the first time
    since February 27^(th) (exactly one week before the market bottomed) that 21 day
    realized volatility turned out to be higher than the level of volatility predicted
    by the VIX.

  zh: 一个月前，VIX收于2009年纪录低点20.69，因此过去一个月实际波动率高于VIX预测的水平并不令人惊讶。我对这一发展感到有趣的是，上周是自2月27日（市场触底前一周）以来，首次21天实际波动率高于VIX预测的波动率。

- en: In the [chart of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week)
    below, I show the relationship between the VIX and realized volatility 21 days
    hence since the beginning of the year. The key point to emphasize is that since
    the beginning of 2009 (actually going back to 11/20/2008) the VIX had anticipated
    higher volatility that actually occurred in the next 21 trading days in all but
    9 trading days in February – until last week. On Monday, Wednesday and Friday
    of last week, the nine month string was broken, as 21day realized volatility exceed
    that of the VIX from 30 days ago.

  zh: 在下面的[本周图表](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week)中，我展示了自年初以来VIX和21天后的实际波动率之间的关系。需要强调的关键点是，自2009年以来（实际上回溯到2008年11月20日），在除了2月份的9个交易日之外，VIX一直预测接下来21个交易日内会出现更高的波动率——直到上周。上周一、三、五，九个月的连续上涨势头被打破，因为21天实际波动率超过了30天前的VIX。
- en: While one may argue about the ability of the VIX and realized volatility to
    predict market direction (in my opinion, it is a reasonably successful indicator,
    but a long way from perfect), there is no arguing that those who have been selling
    volatility and pocketing easy money since the March bottom in stocks are now finding
    that the ‘volatility gap’ which had been providing such reliable profits is no
    longer intact.

  zh: 虽然人们可能会就VIX和实际波动率预测市场方向的能力展开争论（在我看来，它是一个相当成功的指标，但离完美还差得远），但没有人会否认，自从3月份股市触底以来一直在卖波动并轻松获利的那些人现在发现，曾经提供如此可靠利润的“波动率差距”已经不再存在。
- en: Going forward, I think the gap between the VIX and realized volatility should
    be watched for market direction clues, but more importantly, it should provide
    clues about whether opportunities to sell volatility for an easy profit are still
    available – and thus provide a window into the mind of options traders.

  zh: 今后，我认为应该关注VIX和实际波动率之间的差距，以获取市场方向的线索，但更重要的是，它应该提供是否还有机会轻松获利卖波动的线索——从而窥视期权交易员的心态。
