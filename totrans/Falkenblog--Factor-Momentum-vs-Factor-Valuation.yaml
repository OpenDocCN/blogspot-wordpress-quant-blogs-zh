    the value factor. Graham and Dodd, Warren Buffet, Fama and French have all highlighted
    value as an investment strategy. Its essence is the ratio of a backward-looking
    accounting value vs. a forward-looking discounting of future dividends. As we
    are not venture capitalists, but rather, stock investors, all future projections
    are based on current accounting information. To the extent that a market is delusional,
    as in the 1999 tech bubble, that should show up as an excess deviation from the
    accounting or current valuation metric (eg, earnings, book value).  If there's
    any firm characteristic that should capture some of the behavioral bias trends
    among investors, this is it.

    their luck, like Apple in the 1990s, and people project recent troubles too far
    into the future. Thus, current accounting valuations are low, but these are anomalous
    and should be treated as such. Alas, most value companies are not doing poorly,
    they just do not offer any possibility of a 10-fold return, like Tesla or Amazon.
    Greedy, short-sighted investors love stocks with great upside--ignoring the boring
    value stocks--and just as they buy lottery tickets with an explicit 50% premium
    to fair value, they are willing to pay for hope.

    note that it''s useful to turn all your value metrics into ratios where higher
    means cheaper: B/M, E/P, CashFlow/Price, Operating Earnings/Book Equity. This
    helps your intuition as you sift through them. Secondly, E/P is better than P/E
    because E can go through zero into negative numbers, creating a bizarre non-monotonicity
    between your metric and your concept; in contrast, if P goes to zero predicting
    its future performance is irrelevant.'

    30%, and put them in a ratio, you get a sense of how cheap value stocks are: (B/M,
    80th percentile)/(B/M, 20th percentile). Historically all value ratios are trend
    stationary. Given B/M ratios generally move mainly via their market cap and not
    book value or earnings, this means that value stock performance is forecastable.
    A high ratio of B/M for the top value stocks over the bottom value stocks implies
    good times for value stocks, as the M of the value stocks increases relative to
    the M of the anti-value stocks (eg, growth). All of these value metrics are near
    historical highs over the past 70 years (see AlphaArchitech''s charts'

    metrics today that scream 'buy value now', we have the Ur-metric--Book/Market--going
    back to 1927 in the US. This suggests we are not anywhere close to a top, which
    was much higher for most of the 1930s when value did relatively well on a beta-adjusted
    basis.

    performance tends to persist for a couple months at least, and perhaps a year.
    Momentum refers to relative outperformance as opposed to absolute performance,
    which is referred to as 'trend following.' Trend following works as well but applies
    to asset classes like stocks, bonds, and gold, while momentum refers to stocks,
    industries, or factors.

    12%. For the past 10 years, growth has outperformed value by 100%. While iShare's
    growth ETF has a slightly higher beta (1.27 vs 1.05), that does not explain more
    than 20% of this.  Regardless of your momentum definition--3 months, 12 months--value
    is not a buy based on its momentum, which is currently negative, and has been
    for over a decade in the US.

    artifact of a kitchen-sink regression where 121 Barra factors are thrown in, generating
    persistence in alpha? That hypothesis would take a lot of work, but at the very

    to remove the market beta. As the HML portfolio's beta has gone from significantly
    positive to negative and back to slightly positive over time, it's useful to make
    this metric beta-neutral to avoid seeing market fluctuations show up as value
    fluctuations. Unlike the Barra factors, removing the market factor is not prone
    to overfitting, and captures something most sophisticated investors do not just
    understand but actually use.

    that, as it contains a short position, it can be of little interest if the short
    position is driving the results because for most factor investors--who have long
    horizons--short portfolios are not in your opportunity set. Most ''bad'' stocks,
    following the low-vol phenomenon, are not just bad longs, but also bad shorts:
    returns are low, not negative, and volatility is very high. Shorting equity factors
    is generally a bad idea, and thus an irrelevant comparison because you should
    not be tempted to short these things.'

    them they are not. Meanwhile, over the next several months, value's past performance
    suggests a continuation of the trend.  Given the big moves in value tend to last
    for over a year (eg, the run-up and run-down in the 2000 technology bubble), it
    seems prudent to accept missing out on the first quarter of this regime change
    and wait until value starts outperforming the market before doubling down.
