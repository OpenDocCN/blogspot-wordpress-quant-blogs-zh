# VIX and More: SPX 915 as a Top?

I have a strong feeling that the 915 level on the SPX hit in the first half hour of trading today will hold up for awhile. Of course, anything is possible with the bank stress tests and the employment report on deck, but I am betting on 915 holding, especially if the [NDX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/NDX) (NASDAQ-100 continues to be relatively weak)
