- en: '''. Taking over companies that could be insolvent in the future is a horrible
    precedent, setting a vague standard for solvency, because if you are insolvent
    in the future under the government''s opinion, you are insolvent today. Thus,
    insolvency is not the exit criteria, rather one has to plan for future ''future''
    insolvency as defined by the government. This is a political football, meaning,
    it''s all lobbying and appeasing regulators to maintain market power and beat
    down new entrants. I noted in his WSJ editorial, Geithner mentioned that people
    will be more confident in banks after having passed this vetting process, and
    that may have been the motivation, but passing a politically infused stress test
    is not reassuring.'

    a bad risk-return investment will not be incented to invest, because this government
    involvement does not change the payoff space. This is just adding liquidity, and
    is not a subsidy, because the expected value of this is zero if we assume market
    prices are expected values of future payoffs. The cost is actually negative if
    we think the markets are in a panic, but costs are quite high if we think this
    is the mid point in a massive financial cataclysm.

- en: this is a huge subsidy because he thinks market prices are way too high for
    CMBS and RMBS securities, though I think this is really because he believes anything
    that would justify greater government control of economic activity. He has presented
    absolutely zero data on the prices and corresponding historical loss curves for
    the various vintage-product types (eg, Alt-A mortgages, 2006, average current
    price and losses). He doesn't have the data, he wouldn't know how to set it up.
    It's the kind of detail he is ignorant about but does not think is important.
    Details matter. Subprime, Alt-A, conforming,vintage, seasoning all matter. AAA

- en: I found 94 subprime mortgage tranches, and some referred to the same underlying
    mortgage pool. You can find these by going to the Markit ABX index page, looking
    at the constituents, and see they refer to 20 tranches that vary by seniority
    for the various grades (eg, CWALT 2007-21CB M Mtge, BSABS 2007-AQ1 A1) . Anyway,
    the average cumulative 90+ delinquency is about 25%. That's pretty high historically,
    but after seasoning 21 months, this means a conservative estimate of total 90+
    delinquency is going to be around 50%, and losses on those delinquencies no more
    than 50% (housing prices did not fall more than 50% in most places, on average).
    Thats for all of subprime in 2007\. The market price for AAA rated assets (better
    than average) is a mere 25 cents on the dollar, suggesting the average subprime
    mortgage is priced below that, say 10 cents on the dollar. This is way too low.

  zh: 我找到了 94 个次级抵押贷款支持证券，有些涉及相同的基础抵押贷款池。您可以通过访问 Markit ABX 指数页，查看组成部分，并查看它们指的是不同级别的
    20 个支持证券，以及各个等级的优先级（例如，CWALT 2007-21CB M Mtge，BSABS 2007-AQ1 A1） 。无论如何，平均累积 90+
    逾期率约为 25%。从历史上看，这是相当高的，但经过 21 个月的时间，这意味着对总体 90+ 逾期率的保守估计将在 50% 左右，对这些逾期的损失也不会超过
    50%（在大多数地方，平均房价下降幅度不超过 50%）。这是关于 2007 年的次级抵押贷款的情况。AAA 级资产的市场价格（高于平均水平）仅为面值的 25
    美分，这表明平均次级抵押贷款的价格低于该价格，比如每面值的 10 美分。这太低了。
- en: I suspect most banks will be unwilling to sell off assets at market prices,
    because the market prices are so low. In that case the plan 'fails', but it would
    also then cost us nothing, and in the meantime not screw anything up (in contrast
    to the stress test).
