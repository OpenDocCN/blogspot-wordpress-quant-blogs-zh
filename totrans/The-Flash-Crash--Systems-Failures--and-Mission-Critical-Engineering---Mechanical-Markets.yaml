- en: The Flash Crash was caused by a complex interaction between different IT systems.
    Some of those systems failed in an ungraceful manner, and other systems could
    not cope with these failures. What I wish is that, instead of wringing our hands
    about how computers now manage our trading infrastructure, we took the time to
    understand that computers manage systems that are far more mission-critical than
    our financial markets.

    stable markets. I think that any software connecting to markets should have multiple
    layers of safety checks which are as independent as possible. In fact, I would
    argue for much greater risk checks than we have [now](https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2010/2010-210.htm).
    Algorithmic trading companies understand well [what can happen](http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/17/us-knightcapital-results-idUSBRE89G0HI20121017)
    if their safety measures fail. But, the worst thing that can happen to HFTs and
    exchanges is generally bankruptcy. [[1](#bottom1fc)]

    though hopefully erroneous trades can be unwound in those instances. It’s also
    true that traders illegally gaming each other and [manipulating markets](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-04-21/guy-trading-at-home-caused-the-flash-crash)
    can defraud innocent investors. Given the spectacular systems failure of the Flash
    Crash, it’s worth reflecting on the risks associated with shoddy automation in
    other areas of life. I can’t even begin to detail all of the serious IT failures
    we’ve had in the last 50 years, but here are a few (in no particular order) that
    make the Flash Crash look like a triviality:'

- en: The Flash Crash very temporarily resulted in the [loss of about $1T](http://graphics.wsj.com/flash-crash-timeline/)
    in the market-value of securities. It also triggered a media firestorm which potentially
    convinced some retail investors to hold cash, and miss the post-crisis stock market
    recovery. For those active traders who lost money that day, there’s no doubt that
    the Flash Crash was a big deal. But the reality is that the market recovered within
    minutes and many of the accidental transactions at absurd values were cancelled.
    A Flash Crash is also much less likely today, at least in American equity markets,
    where we have circuit breakers that halt trading when it becomes sufficiently
    volatile.

    learn some lessons from the Flash Crash. Unlike exchanges, designers of life-critical
    systems don’t have the luxury of shutting down for a few minutes when problems
    are detected. It’s not great that financial markets’ electronic infrastructure
    couldn’t handle a little stress, but it’s lucky that a failure like this attracted
    media attention without resulting in any loss of life. The anniversary of the
    Flash Crash is a reminder that all critical systems require intelligent regulation
    and, most importantly, is an opportunity to thank the engineers who keep us safe.
