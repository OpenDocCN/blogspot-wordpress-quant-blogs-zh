# Falkenblog: The Delphic Oracle

I'm enjoying Anthony Everitt's

[The Rise of Rome](http://www.amazon.com/Rise-Rome-Making-Worlds-Greatest/dp/1400066638/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1346033223&sr=1-1)

, and he notes that around 500 B.C. the Roman King

[Tarquin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Tarquinius_Superbus)

sent his sons to consult the oracle at Delphi for some insight. At the Temple of Apollo there were written three maxims:

*   Know yourself 
*   Nothing in excess 
*   Offer a guarantee and disaster threatens 

 Now, the first is rather profound, because it highlights that it's very important to tailor one's actions around one's comparative advantages. The second is the famous 'golden mean' of moderation in all things, found in Socrates. But the last is rather odd. I suspect, some type of guarantee was made to a group that became unaffordable, and created a minor revolt. It sure doesn't fit with the other two.
