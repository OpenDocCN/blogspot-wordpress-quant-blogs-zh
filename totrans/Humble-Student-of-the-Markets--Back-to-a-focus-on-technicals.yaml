    come to a debt ceiling deal yet, though both sides are getting closer to a deal.
    But you only die once, and focusing on the fear of a catastrophe isn’t very useful.
    Hedging only works if there is someone you can collect from on your hedge, and
    obsessing over a U.S. default only gets you so far. Instead, I will focus on getting
    back to the technical structure of the market by assuming that all parties agree
    to step back from the brink.

    Remember Bob Farrell’s Rule #7: “Markets are strongest when they are broad and
    weakest when they narrow to a handful of blue-chip names”. As the S&P 500 tests
    its 50 dma, the equal-weighted S&P 500, the mid-cap S&P 400 and the small-cap
    Russell 2000 have already violated their 50 dma.'
