- en: Bollinger Bands (BB) are overbought/oversold indicators. If a stock or index
    rises above its 2 standard deviation BB. it is said to be overbought. Standard
    calculations of BBs are based on a 20 dma. It's unusual to see the market rise
    up above its upper 200 dma BB. The S&P 500 recently reached 110% above of its
    upper BB. The history of such episodes (pink bars) show that it usually pulls
    back soon afterwards. There were only two exceptions since 1997 when the market
    experienced a sustained uptrend (shown by arrows).
