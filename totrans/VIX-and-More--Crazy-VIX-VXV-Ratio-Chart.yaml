    to a regular feature in which I unveiled “Strange and Unusual Charts” that presumably
    had, apart from their novelty, the ability to shine some new light on at least
    one corner of the investment universe. That being said, I have always had an affinity
    for presenting charts that show unusual ratios, non-standard time frames and such
    and while the likes of [Chart Porn](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/01/chart-porn.html)
    and [Unusual Chart of the Month: VXO and RVX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/06/unusual-chart-of-month-vxo-and-rvx.html)
    did get me started down a slippery slope, I never quite fell into the habit of
    tilting wildly at windmills on the plains of StockCharts.com and their brethren.'

    was the [VIX:VXV ratio](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%3AVXV),
    which one blogger insisted was sure to ultimately be my investing legacy. In all
    fairness, for the first year following the launch of [VXV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXV)
    (essentially a 93-day version of the VIX), the VIX:VXV ratio performed as if it
    was going to make all other indicators obsolete. Of course, then the financial
    crisis of 2008 hit and the ratio began sprouting warts all over. While I talk
    about the VIX:VXV ratio only rarely in this space nowadays, the general idea of
    which the VIX:VXV ratio is just one instance of what has become one of the main
    themes of this blog: the idea that an understanding of the [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures)
    [term structure](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/term%20structure)
    is critical to understanding the valuation of and trading opportunities available
    for all VIX products, including futures, options and exchange-traded products.'

    is right out of the same cauldron that produced some of the curiosities of yesteryear.
    The chart below captures 2 ½ years of daily bars in the VIX:VXV ratio and adds
    some green Bollinger bands for color and context, along with a gray area graph
    of the SPX. Finally, I have included a purple line for the VIX:VXV ratio that
    reflects a 500-day exponential moving average (EMA) in order to show the long-term
    average of the ratio.

    the long-term average of the VIX:VXV ratio is not 1.00, but generally hovers in
    the 0.90 – 0.95\. This reflects the fact that the VIX futures term structure has
    historically been in [contango](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/contango)
    (upward sloping, with nearer months less expensive than more distant months) 75-80%
    of the time. Second, note that spikes in the ratio tend to coincide with bottoms
    in stocks and vice versa. Finally, note that even with the crazy [VIX spike](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20spikes)
    last August and September (and record [backwardation](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/backwardation),
    i.e. high VIX:VXV ratios), the ratio has been depressed since December and the
    500-day EMA is now making all-time lows.

    to believe that the VIX is unnaturally low given the scope and magnitude of the
    future threats to equities. Should the ratio continue at its current 0.83, I would
    be very concerned about the possibility of a bearish reversal.
