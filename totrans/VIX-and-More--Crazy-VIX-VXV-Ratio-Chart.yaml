- en: 'There was a point in the history of *VIX and More* that I gave serious consideration
    to a regular feature in which I unveiled “Strange and Unusual Charts” that presumably
    had, apart from their novelty, the ability to shine some new light on at least
    one corner of the investment universe. That being said, I have always had an affinity
    for presenting charts that show unusual ratios, non-standard time frames and such
    and while the likes of [Chart Porn](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/01/chart-porn.html)
    and [Unusual Chart of the Month: VXO and RVX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/06/unusual-chart-of-month-vxo-and-rvx.html)
    did get me started down a slippery slope, I never quite fell into the habit of
    tilting wildly at windmills on the plains of StockCharts.com and their brethren.'

  zh: 在*VIX和更多*的历史上，我曾经认真考虑过定期推出一个特色栏目，揭示那些除了新奇之外，还能为投资宇宙的至少一个角落带来新视角的“奇怪和异常图表”。说到这里，我一直偏爱展示一些不寻常的比率、非标准的时段等图表，尽管[图表色情](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/01/chart-porn.html)和[异常图表月度：VXO和RVX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/06/unusual-chart-of-month-vxo-and-rvx.html)这类东西使我走上了不归路，但我从未完全陷入在StockCharts.com及其同行的平原上疯狂攻击风车的习惯。
- en: 'One rabbit hole that I was definitely the first down and pursued the most aggressively
    was the [VIX:VXV ratio](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%3AVXV),
    which one blogger insisted was sure to ultimately be my investing legacy. In all
    fairness, for the first year following the launch of [VXV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXV)
    (essentially a 93-day version of the VIX), the VIX:VXV ratio performed as if it
    was going to make all other indicators obsolete. Of course, then the financial
    crisis of 2008 hit and the ratio began sprouting warts all over. While I talk
    about the VIX:VXV ratio only rarely in this space nowadays, the general idea of
    which the VIX:VXV ratio is just one instance of what has become one of the main
    themes of this blog: the idea that an understanding of the [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures)
    [term structure](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/term%20structure)
    is critical to understanding the valuation of and trading opportunities available
    for all VIX products, including futures, options and exchange-traded products.'

  zh: 我绝对是第一个深入探索并积极追求的兔子洞之一是[VIX:VXV比率](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%3AVXV)，一位博主坚持认为这最终将成为我的投资遗产。公平地说，在[VXV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXV)（基本上是VIX的93天版本）推出后的第一年，VIX:VXV比率表现得就像它将使所有其他指标过时。当然，然后2008年的金融危机来袭，比率开始长出各种疣。尽管我现在在这个领域很少谈论VIX:VXV比率，但VIX:VXV比率只是博客主题的一个实例：理解[VIX期货](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures)的[期限结构](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/term%20structure)对于理解所有VIX产品的估值和可用的交易机会至关重要，包括期货、期权和交易所交易产品。
- en: All of which brings me – somewhat belatedly, perhaps – to today’s chart, which
    is right out of the same cauldron that produced some of the curiosities of yesteryear.
    The chart below captures 2 ½ years of daily bars in the VIX:VXV ratio and adds
    some green Bollinger bands for color and context, along with a gray area graph
    of the SPX. Finally, I have included a purple line for the VIX:VXV ratio that
    reflects a 500-day exponential moving average (EMA) in order to show the long-term
    average of the ratio.

  zh: 这一切都让我——可能有些迟缓——到了今天的图表，它正是来自那个曾产生去年一些奇观的锅。下面的图表捕捉了VIX:VXV比率2 ½年的日线柱状图，并添加了一些绿色的布林带以增加色彩和背景，还有一个灰色的SPX区域图。最后，我加入了一条紫色的VIX:VXV比率线，反映了500天的指数移动平均（EMA），以显示比率的长期平均值。
- en: While there are many interesting nuggets buried in this chart, first note that
    the long-term average of the VIX:VXV ratio is not 1.00, but generally hovers in
    the 0.90 – 0.95\. This reflects the fact that the VIX futures term structure has
    historically been in [contango](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/contango)
    (upward sloping, with nearer months less expensive than more distant months) 75-80%
    of the time. Second, note that spikes in the ratio tend to coincide with bottoms
    in stocks and vice versa. Finally, note that even with the crazy [VIX spike](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20spikes)
    last August and September (and record [backwardation](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/backwardation),
    i.e. high VIX:VXV ratios), the ratio has been depressed since December and the
    500-day EMA is now making all-time lows.

  zh: 虽然这幅图表中埋藏了许多有趣的细节，但首先要注意的是VIX:VXV比率的长期平均值不是1.00，而是通常在0.90 – 0.95之间波动。这反映了VIX期货的期限结构历史上一直处于[正向市场](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/contango)（向上倾斜，近期合约比远期合约便宜）75-80%的时间。其次，注意比率的大幅波动通常与股票的底部和顶部相一致。最后，要注意即使在上个月的8月和9月出现了疯狂的[VIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20spikes)跳升（以及创纪录的[反向市场](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/backwardation)，即高VIX:VXV比率），但自12月以来比率一直低迷，而500天的指数移动平均线现在创下了历史新低。
- en: What does this mean? Lots of things, but in simple terms investors continue
    to believe that the VIX is unnaturally low given the scope and magnitude of the
    future threats to equities. Should the ratio continue at its current 0.83, I would
    be very concerned about the possibility of a bearish reversal.

  zh: 这意味着什么？有很多东西，但简单地说，投资者继续认为，鉴于未来对股市的威胁的范围和规模，VIX指数偏低。如果比率继续保持在当前的0.83，我会非常担心熊市反转的可能性。
