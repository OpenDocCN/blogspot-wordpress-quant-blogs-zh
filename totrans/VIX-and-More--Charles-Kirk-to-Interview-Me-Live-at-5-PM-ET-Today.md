# VIX and More: Charles Kirk to Interview Me Live at 5 PM ET Today

I am excited to announce that Charles Kirk of [The Kirk Report](http://www.kirkreport.com/) will be conducting a live interview with me at 5:00 p.m. ET today for one hour.

The format of the interview is text-based and Charles typically includes a healthy dose of questions from the audience, so I encourage anyone who is interested to join us at [this link](http://kirkreport.com/tkr/sb4jd) – and bring along some questions in your back pocket.

Since I live only about five miles by kayak from AT&T Park, I am acutely aware of tonight’s World Series game, but I have it on good authority that our interview will not run into extra innings and put fans in some sort of [Heidi Game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heidi_Game) dilemma.

So bring your questions and I will bring the lumber, dig in, and be sure not to take any pitches, no matter how far out of the strike zone they may be…
