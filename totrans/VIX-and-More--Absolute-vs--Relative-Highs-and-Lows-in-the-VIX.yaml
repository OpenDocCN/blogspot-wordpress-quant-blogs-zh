    is one of many who maintain that the best way to think about the VIX is not in
    terms of absolute numbers and a multi-year lookback period. He recommends that
    traders focus instead on relative highs and lows over the course of recent trading
    ranges. Specifically, Headley favors 20-bar Bollinger bands with 2 standard deviations
    and [opines](http://www.worden.com/training/Default.aspx?g=posts&t=19131),'

    getting the most of out the VIX using relative bands like Bollinger Bands. You
    can see that when the market tagged these lower boundaries for the VIX, as in
    mid-December and mid-November, then the market is ready to correct or at least
    go sideways. This follow-up information will prove invaluable as a contrarian,
    being willing to sell the market when the VIX is at its lower band, while being
    able to get more aggressive when we see fear spikes to the upper band. "'

    and am of the opinion that Bollinger bands can provide solid trading setups not
    just for the broader markets, but for the VIX as well.
