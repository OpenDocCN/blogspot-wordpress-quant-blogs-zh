    has a video post up this morning, [Options Market Does Not Care About Selloff](http://www.stumbleupon.com/su/6c9jSD/www.investingwithoptions.com/2011/12/12/options-market-does-not-care-about-selloff/),
    in which he discusses how the [implied volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/implied%20volatility)
    in various asset class volatility indices (VIX, [GVZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/GVZ),
    [EVZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EVZ)) are showing a very muted
    reaction to today’s selloff in stocks.

- en: As noted here previously, the VIX generally moves about -4x in percentage terms
    the direction of the SPX. Mondays generally see a slightly larger move in the
    VIX relative to the SPX (usually an incremental 0.5% - 1.0% increase over Friday’s
    close) due to [calendar reversion](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/calendar%20reversion)
    or the weekend effect, so today one would expect to see the VIX moving at least
    4x in the opposite direction of the SPX.

    up only 3.9% -- so the VIX is about half as sensitive to changes in the SPX that
    is typical for a Monday trading session.

    (and elsewhere) or that today’s move is just a head fake by stocks, but it does
    mean that the consensus expectations for immediate downside risk are quite low.
