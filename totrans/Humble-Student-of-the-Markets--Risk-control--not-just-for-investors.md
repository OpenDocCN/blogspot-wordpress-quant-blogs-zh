I know that I am behind the times sometimes, but take a look at this video. It was made in support of the PR campaign for the remake of the film "Carrie":

As I watched the so-called prank, it occurred to me that the producers should be careful not to stage this stunt in a jurisdiction where there is a "stand your ground" law. Let's just suppose that a so-called weapon carrying patron came upon this scene. Would he feel justified to shoot the actress playing the Carrie-like character, especially if he saw the demonstration that she had unknown psychic powers and he felt that his personally safety was threatened?

When you life in a country where citizens have a constitutional right to bear arms, a little risk control goes a long way. Just remember the motto on the New Hampshire license plate:

Just something to ponder as you read your weekend paper.
