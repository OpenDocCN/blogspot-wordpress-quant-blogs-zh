    Lustig, Nick Roussanov, and Adrien Verdelha), say they find risk premia in currency
    markets that are ‘large and time varying’. The search for risk is the snipe hunt
    of Business School professors, something they talk about all the time, but their
    students never see directly. As beta is negatively correlated with returns in
    equities, one would think, wow, finally, a risk-return nexus that proves all that
    mean-variance analysis you learn in B-school isn''t total bullshit.'

    factor’. It’s the average return to currencies relative to the US dollar. It would
    be the average return of an American investing, equal-weighted, in the smorgasbord
    of international currencies.

    rate currencies. Thus, a currency with a 15% interest rate would be ‘long’, and
    one with a 1% interest rate would be short, and this represents what an average
    ‘carry trade’ at a hedge fund looks like, which then is a proxy for this ‘carry
    risk factor’.

    correlation between risk on the x axis, and return on the y axis.

    risk is defined by the return, which is then used to ''explain'' returns.'

    is not a tautology, because, in theory, with a large number of assets, an asset
    merely being correlated with the return of a proxy portfolio is not necessarily
    referring to itself. Not necessarily, but in practice, it is, because there are
    so few assets. In this paper's case, you have only 15 developed countries, hardly
    a large sample. Further, many of these countries being very correlated due to
    economic entanglements (eg, Belgium, the Netherlands and Denmark). So the sample
    is quite small. In effect, instead of having 15 ‘different’ currencies, you really
    only have 5 after you adjust for the implicit correlation.

- en: Anyway, with 5 countries, one risk factor is the average return of currencies
    against the dollar. Well, when the dollar is strong, all these currencies depreciate,
    and when it is weak, they appreciate, on average. It appears that because of trending
    in the dollar, you can predict that a currency correlated with the average currency
    vis-à-vis the dollar based on this factor. In other words, if you want to predict
    the yen, and the yen has been appreciating against the dollar, bet on it continuing.
    That is momentum.

    trade, which will tend to be those currencies in the carry trade. With 5 currencies
    (in effect), the high interest rate currencies will be going through similar issues
    and same for the low interest rate currencies. Again, correlation with the factor
    is tantamount to being one of the currencies used to create the factor.

    size and book-to-market (the Fama-French portfolios), are then ‘explained’ by
    the size and book-to-market factors. Who’d a thunk it?

    a currency’s momentum and interest rate, risky? In the good old days we had a
    simple reason, because it was volatile. Then, with Markowitz, we said, because
    it was correlated with the S&P500 (a broad market, excluding diversifiable risk).
    Then, with the Roll critique, we said the ‘market portfolio’, which includes real
    estate, bonds, etc. Then, we tried the APT and ICAPM, which suggested things correlated
    with aggregate wealth like industrial production, labor earnings, the price of
    oil. We tried ‘latent’ factor models, which were statistical constructs that explain
    portfolio variance. None of these worked.

    size and value anomalies, just call them risk factors, and hope no one notices
    how completely circular your reasoning is. Now, logically, it could be true that
    size and value, or the carry trade, or dollar momentum, are truly risk factors.
    But if that were true, one would expect these risk factors to have some generality,
    so that, say, a set of risk factors used to explain, say, equities, would be applicable
    towards currencies and vice versa. But no. ‘risk factors’ are very parochial,
    and only explain the particular asset under examination, which is why I think
    they are not risk factors, but merely a clever attempt to relabel the most conspicuous
    return characteristic within an asset class as ‘risk’ because by assumption risk
    and return are positively correlated.

    is based on returns of those very same assets.
