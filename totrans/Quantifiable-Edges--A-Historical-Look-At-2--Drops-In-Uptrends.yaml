    follow all 2%+ drops while the market is above the 200ma.

- en: The stats table is impressive and suggests a solid upside edge.  But there is
    a problem with this study that can’t be seen in a stats table.  It hasn’t worked
    well lately.  To illustrate this I have broken it into 2 studies below.  This
    first one shows the 1993 – 1999 period.

    is 2000 – present.

- en: No edge suggested here.  Market dynamics are always changing.  Sometimes for
    reasons we can explain, and sometimes not.  In either case, when you use edges
    in setting your bias, it is important to make sure those edges have held up in
    recent times as well.
