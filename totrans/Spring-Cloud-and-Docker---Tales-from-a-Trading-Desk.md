# Spring Cloud and Docker | Tales from a Trading Desk

## Spring Cloud and Docker

Another worth while read on Docker and Continuous Delivery (CD) [pipeline](https://dzone.com/articles/microservice-architecture-with-spring-cloud-and-do) using docker.  What is nice these days is the Spring annotations that avoid a lot of boiler plate code:

> with one spring-cloud-starter-feign dependency and @EnableFeignClients annotation you have a full suite of a load balancer, circuit breaker, and HTTP client with a sensible ready-to-go default configuration.

Exercise for the reader is probably to add [spring-cloud-stream](http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/) to the codebase 🙂
