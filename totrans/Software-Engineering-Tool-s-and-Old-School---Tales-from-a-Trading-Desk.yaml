    Specifically, living in an IDE sometimes causes one to fail to understand the
    magic the IDE does to hide the underlying interaction with the source control
    system, or unit test runner.  If the IDE breaks, software engineers stand around
    in some cases lost as to how to move forwards until the IDE is “fixed”.  The old
    school way of doing development was with an editor (e.g. vi) and the command line. 
    Today I feel software engineers shy away from the command line, which I correlate
    to the effect I saw with the uptake of Java in the early days – software engineers
    went from a C++ world of knowing (possibly) how the OS worked to the VM world
    of not really caring about how the OS work with regards to thread and more.  
    Progress comes in many forms

    due to the lack of IDE tooling that has become the norm for .NET and Java software
    engineers.  This has in some cases forced the abandoning of IDE’s for a tool chains
    based on pure editors and the command line – a light weight development experience
    with full control, others in the JavaScript world struggle due to lack of IDE
    tooling.
