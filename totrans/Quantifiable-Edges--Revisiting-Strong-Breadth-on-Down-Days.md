# Quantifiable Edges: Revisiting Strong Breadth on Down Days

Despite the SPX closing lower yesterday, the NYSE saw 56% of its issues close higher.  This brought about a study that I last showed in the 6/29/12 blog.  Results are updated.

The numbers here suggest an upside edge.  While not extremely powerful, it does appear to be nicely consistent over the first few days.
