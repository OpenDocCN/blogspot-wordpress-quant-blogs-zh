    posts I have been striving for more of a generalist theme, with only occasional
    excursions into the land of volatility. I am making an exception this week, because
    for the first time in five months the [historical volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/historical%20volatility)
    of the S&P 500 index (SPX) as measured by 10 day, 20 day, 30 day and 50 day look
    back periods is less than 40 in all four instances.

- en: In the chart below, I have elected to show the fluctuations in the volatility
    of the SPX over the course of the past eight months as reflected in two [Bollinger
    bands](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Bollinger%20bands) ranges.
    The outer range (gray) is the standard 20 day, 2 standard deviations measure.
    The inner range (blue) covers 20 days but only one standard deviation. The contraction
    of the Bollinger bands since the beginning of December and particularly in the
    first two weeks of February shows how volatility has been declining dramatically,
    notwithstanding the mid-January spike in the VIX. In fact, at current levels,
    the Bollinger bands are now as narrow as they have been since the week of the
    Lehman Brothers bankruptcy.

    the end of the month, with a VIX below 35 more likely than a VIX above 50.
