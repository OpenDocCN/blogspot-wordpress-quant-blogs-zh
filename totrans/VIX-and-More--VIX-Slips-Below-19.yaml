    sense of what some investors are thinking just by looking at the Google searches
    that result in people clicking through to the blog.  Today, for instance, I note
    some have found their way to *VIX and More* with the following Google searches:'

    below 19 and trying to understand that number in the context of headlines filled
    with gloom and doom.  One possible conclusion, which I’m sure accounts for a fair
    number of the Google searches above, is that it is just a matter of time before
    the VIX spikes to a level consistent with the fear and anxiety which dominates
    much of the media coverage of the markets at the moment.

    10 day simple moving average and 11.8% below the 100 day SMA.  Further, because
    today is a Friday and we have some low volume days approaching in advance of the
    Labor Day holiday, there are some [calendar reversion](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/calendar%20reversion)
    effects at work, as Adam at [Daily Options Report](http://adamsoptions.blogspot.com/)
    has detailed nicely in [VIX Bicentennial Parade](http://adamsoptions.blogspot.com/2008/08/bicentennial-vix-parade.html)
    and several previous posts.

    (see futures quotes from optionsXpress below) shows that futures expectations
    for the VIX for October to May are generally in the range of 22.50 – 23.20.  Anyone
    considering a [VIX options](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20options)
    trade needs to get a better sense of how VIX options are priced off of and generally
    move with VIX futures, *not* the cash or spot VIX index that is four points lower.

    low at the moment.  Looking at a weekly chart, for instance, the VIX is toward
    the middle of the typical [Bollinger band](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Bollinger%20bands)
    settings.  This is the essence of VIX options:  when they look like sitting ducks,
    it is usually an optical illusion.'

    VIX options may be inexpensive portfolio insurance and/or a good leveraged bet
    against further turmoil in the markets. The key concept to remember is that a
    3-4 point move in the cash/spot VIX will have little impact on the VIX futures
    prices on which the VIX options are based.
