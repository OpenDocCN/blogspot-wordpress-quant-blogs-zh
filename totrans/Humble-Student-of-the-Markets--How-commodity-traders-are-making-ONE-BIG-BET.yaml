- en: A number of years ago, I worked as an equity portfolio manager at a Commodity
    Trading Advisor that used trend following models. While I knew nothing about the
    specifics of their models, I knew that the traders next door appeared white-knuckled
    at the end of the day. Even though they were diversified across many different
    contracts, the trading system often steered them into a single BIG MACRO BET.
    The bet might be characterized as a directional exposure to interest rates, or
    currencies, etc.

    China. Both the Australian and Canadian economies are commodity producers, but
    Australia trades more with China and Canada trades more with the US. The chart
    below shows the AUDCAD cross has violated a key technical support zone and it
    is in a downtrend. It does, however, appear to be trying to consolidate near a
    Fibonacci retracement level.

    Zhou has led many PBoC financial reforms, such as ending the USD peg and liberalized
    interest rate policy, which has started to end financial repression of the household
    sector, he has stood firm against wholesale stimulus efforts when the economy
    starts to slow, as it is doing now. It is rumored that President Xi would prefer
    the PBoC to be more accommodative during such periods and Zhou's replacement is
    more likely to induce more credit-driven growth during current periods of subpar
    growth - and that would be commodity demand friendly in the short-term.

    considers the US a major locomotive of growth today. Consider this chart of the
    relative performance of the SPX relative to the MSCI All-Country World Index.
    The SPX recently staged a relative upside breakout in the context of a long-term
    relative uptrend.

    both of them considered to be the "risk-free rates" for global investors. Though
    the growth and monetary policy outlooks are very different for the two regions,
    The 1,6% differential is likely to attract funds to the USD and exert downward
    pressure on the EURUSD exchange rate.

    my inner trader is positioning himself for the inevitable commodity rally, but
    my inner investor is positioning himself to fade the coming commodity strength
    as he is a longer term USD bull.

    to how this USD/commodity trade develops. Rising commodity prices affect inflationary
    expectations, which feeds into the timing of Fed policy changes.
