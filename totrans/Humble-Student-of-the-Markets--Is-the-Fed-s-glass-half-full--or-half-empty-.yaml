- en: 'The fluctuation of fed funds futures has been so extreme that, since their
    inception in 1994, the only other months to see such volatility were: January
    2001 (when the Fed started to hike); September 2001, month of the 9/11 terrorist
    attacks; January and October in the crisis year of 2008; and March 2020, when
    Covid-19 arrived. This is according to an analysis by Bespoke Investment Group.
    In contrast to the Fed’s current tightening regime, all those months saw the central
    bank cutting rather than hiking in response to clear crisis conditions. Over the
    last month, the gap between the highest and lowest fed funds rates that have been
    predicted stands at 77.5 basis points:'

    appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently
    restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time",
