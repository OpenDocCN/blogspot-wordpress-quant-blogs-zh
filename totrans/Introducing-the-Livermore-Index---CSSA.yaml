- en: Like many other traders, I fell in love with Reminiscences of a Stock Operator”
    which was a book based upon the famous speculator Jesse Livermore. The trading
    concepts introduced in the book both from a pure technical as well as psychological
    standpoint are timeless. The most interesting part of this book was the concept
    of trading the “active stocks” and following the “leaders.” This concept was brought
    up in Jesse Livermore’s own books on the market, where he emphasizes trading stocks
    that are highly liquid and active, and are leading the market. He also discusses
    finding stocks that have a predictable “personality” and tend to suit his style
    very well. Livermore’s writings and concepts were reborn in modern days through
    legendary trader Nicholas Darvas (How I Made $2,000,000 in the stock market) and
    William O’Neil of Investors Business Daily (How to Make Money in Stocks). These
    three books (including Reminiscences of a Stock Operator) are my three favorite
    investment books of all time. All of them emphasize using a trend-following/breakout
    method trading the “active” stocks and “market leaders” as the path to investment
    success. Some of the more modern success stories such as the world-record holder
    for highest annual return Dan Zanger (who is definitely no flash in the pan),
    also uses a similar approach. Dan Zanger also discusses having a proprietary list
    of his own “pet” stocks that fit his criteria. Purportedly they are “volatile”
    and tend to give fewer false signals.

    investors/traders use this type of method to achieve phenomenal wealth whether
    they are trading stocks or futures. In contrast very few have done the same with
    short-term approach. It also seems that all of these investors/traders apply some
    sort of filter to identify the best stocks to trade. The IBD 100 is currently
    the only formal index that best represents this approach. It is in fact a very
    respectable index, and a good resource for active traders. However it suffers
    from several drawbacks: 1) the approach is not universal: it is specific to stocks
    only and cannot be applied to other asset classes 2) it makes too many assumptions
    about how the market should work versus the way it actually works: I actually
    tested numerous statements/assumptions made by O’Neil and found that many do not
    have statistical validity 3) it contains too many illiquid and speculative stocks
    that Livermore would never consider trading (or even O’Neil himself).'

- en: So, to address these issues I created “The Livermore Index” which is a universal
    method that can be applied to any asset class and its components. The Livermore
    Index is ideal for short-term or long-term trend trading or momentum-based approaches
    as we shall soon see. The method used to create the index is proprietary, but
    it uses only a few different measures. The Livermore Strength Rating or “LSR”
    is used to rank each stock by its favorability. The highest LSR stocks are the
    ones you want to trade, as they are the “easiest”  and most likely to make you
    a sizable profit using any type of trend strategy–including standard breakouts
    which have in the last 10 years been very difficult to trade. Needless to say,
    the results of using this method were quite shocking, and completely break the
    paradigm of how to identify the “active” or “market-leading” stocks. More on this
    to come……….
