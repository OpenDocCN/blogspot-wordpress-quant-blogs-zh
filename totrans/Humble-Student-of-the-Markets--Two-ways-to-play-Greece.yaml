- en: The fast money crowd has been selling Greece (and eurozone stocks) in anticipation
    of a negative resolution to the negotiations. Judging from the technical condition
    of the markets, they are nearing a crowded short condition and a significant relief
    rally is likely when any resolution of the issues, whether positive or negative,
    hits the tape. The most likely negative trigger would be the ECB either refusing
    to support the Greek banking system any further through ELA, or requiring higher
    haircuts on Greek paper pledged as ELA collateral.

    yield spreads would likely widen and risk premiums rise, which negatively affects
    the discount rate on earnings. As well, the viability of Greece in the eurozone
    and the EU itself would also shake the very foundation of the European Union.

    scale. Not only did the euro simplify the cost of doing business in the eurozone,
    which raised the earnings growth rate, it created an economy of scale in the corporate
    bond market. A Dutch company could finance a cross-border acquisition of an Italian
    company, or vice versa, more cheaply because of the better depth of the euro-denominated
    corporate bond market, compared to a single currency one like the Dutch Guilder.
    Much of those benefits could come into question.

    in and out of in months, not days and minutes like fast-money traders. The BoAML
    FMS indicates that they are overweight the eurozone and they will likely be re-evaluating
    their eurozone equity exposure if Greece were to go over a cliff. In the case
    of a relief rally in the face of a Greek default or Grexit, investors should take
    the opportunity of any relief rally to lighten their positions.
