- en: An increasing number of quantivity trading strategies are incorporating [exotics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exotic_option),
    either synthetically or via direct instruments. Alpha is easier to tickle out
    on exotics due to less transparency to the retail masses. Further, exotics tend
    to confound many classic trading strategies.

- en: History of retail exotics is a comparatively short one, with two recent hits.
    CBOE [VIX](http://www.cboe.com/micro/vix/introduction.aspx) was a massive well-known
    success, introducing vol trading and [volarb](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_arbitrage)
    to retail (props to [VixAndMore](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/) for pioneering
    the blogosphere on this topic). VIX was quickly followed by VIX futures, VIX options,
    VXX, VXN, VXZ, and their friends across the indices and [vol surface](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_smile).
    More recently, leveraged ETFs and their derivatives have been a similar success
    story (as discussed previously here in [Leveraged ETFs and Market Close](https://quantivity.wordpress.com/2009/07/28/leveraged-etfs-market-close/)).

    bread and butter, [implied correlation](http://www.cboe.com/micro/impliedcorrelation/default.aspx)
    and [binary](http://www.cboe.com/micro/binaries/introduction.aspx) exotics now
    exist. Gotta love any retail derivative for which the prospectus is covered in
    formula (as VIX was, for those readers who remember back to its original launch).
    Undoubtedly, more retail exotics will continue to blossom as traders become familiar
    with them.

- en: For those mathematically-inclined, exotics offer a natural frontier for exploiting
    superior modeling and estimation techniques. In comparison to volatility derivatives
    (for which there is a massive academic and trading literature), these more recent
    exotics have a comparative dearth of coverage. As such, the alpha opportunity
    should be commensurately higher.

    both quantitative and algorithmic trading aspects of exotics—now that they are
    gaining increasing retail liquidity.
