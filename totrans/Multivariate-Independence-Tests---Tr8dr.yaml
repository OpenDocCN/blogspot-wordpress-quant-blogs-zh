    can be used in a 1st pass to trim out the obviously independent variables.   Assume
    a d-dimensional joint distributions **p(x0, x1, x2, … xd)** as a starting point
    with sample vector X = { x0, x1, x2, .. xd }.

    **n** and **m** dimensional distributions respectively (where d = n+m).  We want
    to test to see whether the marginal distribution of **n** variables is independent
    of the distribution of **m** variables.   Our sample vector for the full joint
    distribution can be expressed as:'

- en: where N is the number of samples.   This test is valid even for non-elliptical
    distributions, so is a good 1st line test.   The intuition with the above measure
    is that the determinant ratio is measuring the volume of the covariance matrix
    in ratio to the volumes of the non-crossing components of covariance.   If the
    volume is mostly explained by the non-crossing components, then A and B are independent.
