    bull market just flashed a buy signal. The percentage of S&P 500 above their 50
    dma rose from below 5%, which is an oversold extreme, to over 90%, an overbought
    extreme. Such a breadth had been a buy signal with a 100% success rate until this
    year. This indicator flashed a buy signal in August, which failed badly and it
    recycled back to below 5%.
