- en: For the fourth week in a row, the U.S. [fiscal cliff](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/fiscal%20cliff)
    topped the list of investor [fears](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/fear)
    about the stock market. With all the media attention heaped on the fiscal cliff
    since the election, it should come as no surprise that the fiscal cliff outpolled
    the second-place [European sovereign debt crisis](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/European%20sovereign%20debt%20crisis)
    by 10.9%, the widest margin since the [Fear Poll](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Fear%20poll)
    began four weeks ago.

    as the earnings season winds down, while anxiety about problems related to excessive
    central bank interventions moved into the #4 slot. Among write-in votes, the biggest
    issue is frustration with government and politicians, which is certainly related
    to some of fears about how the fiscal cliff and euro zone problems will be resolved.'

- en: The Americentric perspective was once again in evidence this week, with U.S.
    respondents seeing the fiscal cliff as more concerning than the European sovereign
    debt crisis by a margin of 16.2%, while non-U.S. respondents saw the two issues
    as almost equally important, with the fiscal cliff winning out by only 1.8%. Interestingly,
    this parochialism seems to be a largely American phenomenon, as Israeli respondents
    have been *less* concerned about Iran than non-Israeli respondents and [German](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Germany)
    respondents have been *less* concerned about the European sovereign debt crisis
    than the rest of the world.

- en: With the U.S. elections now in the rear view mirror, U.S. respondents were no
    doubt at least partly influenced by the media pivoting away from the elections
    and toward the fiscal cliff issues – a development I analyzed yesterday in [The
    Rise of Fiscal Cliff Concerns](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2012/11/the-rise-of-fiscal-cliff-concerns.html).

    a very interesting data set. Clearly we have a lot to learn about what drives
    fear and how those fears can be amplified by geography, media and proximity in
    time.
