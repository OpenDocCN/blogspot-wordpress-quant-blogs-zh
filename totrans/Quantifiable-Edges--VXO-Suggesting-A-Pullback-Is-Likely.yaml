    are very suggestive of short-term bearish implications. Also of note is that 18
    of 20 instances (90%) closed lower at some point in the next 3 days. There was
    only one instance that failed to close lower than the entry at some point in the
    next 7 days. That instance was 10/19/98 which essentially traded sideways for
    7 days before beginning a new leg up.
