- en: Wall Street & Technology provide a list of 10 [notable](http://www.wallstreetandtech.com/technology-risk-management/10-trading-glitches-that-stopped-the-mar/240160397)
    software glitches that caused market mayhem.  Although a very interesting read
    as to how to loose a substantial amount of money, it does beg the question as
    to what lessons have been learn in software engineering from each of these incidents. 
    I’m guessing that there are at least a minimum of two categories that these glitches
    fall into; failure to understand all edge cases prior to software implementation
    and deployment, and buggy software.  In the case of buggy software, I’d be curious
    to know which of the 10 glitches leveraged BDD from story (requirement) to code, 
    I’m also curious the more I think about these issues to know if the classic software
    measurements were also part of the problem (code coverage etc) is providing a
    false sense of security.
