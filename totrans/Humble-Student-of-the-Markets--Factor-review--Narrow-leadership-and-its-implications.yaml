    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    depicting the changes in leadership of different groups, such as sectors, countries
    or regions, or market factors. The charts are organized into four quadrants. The
    typical group rotation pattern occurs in a clockwise fashion. Leading groups (top
    right) deteriorate to weakening groups (bottom right), which then rotates to lagging
    groups (bottom left), which changes to improving groups (top left), and finally
    completes the cycle by improving to leading groups (top right) again.
