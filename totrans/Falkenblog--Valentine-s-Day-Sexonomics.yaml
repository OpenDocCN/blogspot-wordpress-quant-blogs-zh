    can be analyzed using economic reasoning, or really, assuming individuals are
    self interested, and applying statistics and logic to that. Many people find this
    application of 'economics' much more interesting than applying such logic to widgets
    or muni bonds, so why not just get all those cost and indifference curves in price/quantity
    space out of economics textbooks, and replace with sexy pictures and fun sex trivia?

    launch an atomic bomb at you, you actually deter their use of the bomb. Committing
    to an irrational response, is rational. In a similar way, prudish mores about
    sex can make everyone in society better off, because without stigma and shame
    of having sex outside a pair-bond, there''s massive sexual inequality and lower
    parental investment. Consider that monogamy is good for beta or omega males, because
    that keeps alpha males with only one female. But if sexual morality becomes unpopular,
    serial monogamy (aka one-night stands) will be a dominant strategy for those with
    the highest value, because they can. Those with the most to gain from such activity
    will do it most, further eroding the quaint stigma attached to casual sex, encouraging
    more of it. Those with low value will try to have casual sex to signal they have
    higher value, leading to an equilibrium like when Charlton Heston comes down from
    the mountain with the 10 commandments and it''s the best frat party ever (soon
    ruined by a vengeful God, and as always the people who didn''t rush are very envious).
    Charlotte Adam''s piece on the New Dating Game basically suggests this is what
    is happening, leading to alpha males having many partners, omega males left out,
    and women of all qualities tolerating philandering men who aren''t there to raise
    the kids (aka, ''restoring primate-style hypergamy'').'

    higher for men. In any case, women can extract compensation from men in return
    for sex, because the person with the higher elasticity has the market power. Ergo,
    men have to bring more to the transaction than their bodies, they have to pay
    for dates, open doors, put the toilet seat down, etc. Indeed, on a day-to-day
    basis, a woman''s lower sexual desire negates a man’s physical or monetary advantage,
    which is why most women are at least co-equals in their relationships.'
