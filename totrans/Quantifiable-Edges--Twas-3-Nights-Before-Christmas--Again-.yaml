     The study below is the “Twas 3 Nights Before Christmas” study, and I have shown

- en: The stats all appear quite strong.  I would note the “Max Losing Trade” column
    shows very mild numbers from days 1-8, with no decline being worse than 2.5%.
     Of course the fiscal cliff appears to be getting us off to a rough start this
    morning, and we could be in danger of the worst “Day 1” of the study…
