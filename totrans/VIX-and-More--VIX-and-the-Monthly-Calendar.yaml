    and no one cared about the subject, I sliced and diced a bunch of VIX data in
    good ol’ Excel in an effort to identify some cycles that affect the VIX. Some
    of the results were particularly intriguing (the annual cycle and the FOMC cycle,
    for instance) and others were decidedly less enlightening.

    calendar. The quarterly cycle and the options expiration cycle touch a little
    bit on the monthly cycle, but rather than interpolate at 30,000 feet, I think
    it is time to look at the monthly cycle more closely.

    a calendar month into a 22 day trading month, normalizes the VIX at 100, then
    aggregates VIX closing values for all the trading days from 1990 through yesterday.
    (I like to normalize the VIX in these graphs because it makes it easier to get
    a perspective on the magnitude of changes from point to point.)
