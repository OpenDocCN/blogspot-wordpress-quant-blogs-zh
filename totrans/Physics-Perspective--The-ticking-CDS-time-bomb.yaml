    case -- as with the crisis of 2007-2008 -- the root cause of the trouble is CDSs
    and other derivatives. No one in Europe is quite sure how many reckless gambles
    banks have made over Greek debt and potential default, and the European Central
    Bank appears to be deadly afraid that such gambles have the potential to bring
    down the entire financial house of cards.

    the value of outstanding CDS linked to debt in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal
    has doubled in the past three years -- since 2008!! The New York Times

- en: The uncertainty, financial analysts say, has led European officials to push
    for a “voluntary” Greek bond financing solution that may sidestep a default, rather
    than the forced deals of other eras. “There’s not any clarity here because people
    don’t know,” said Christopher Whalen, editor of [The Institutional Risk Analyst](http://us1.institutionalriskanalytics.com/pub/IRAMain.asp
    "Web site of The Institutional Risk Analyst."). “This is why the Europeans came
    up with this ridiculous deal, because they don’t know what’s out there. They are
    afraid of a default. The industry is still refusing to provide the disclosure
    needed to understand this. They’re holding us hostage. The Street doesn’t want
    you to see what they’ve written.”

    century under the gaming laws, but in 2000, Congress gave Wall Street an exemption
    and it has turned out to be a very bad idea.
