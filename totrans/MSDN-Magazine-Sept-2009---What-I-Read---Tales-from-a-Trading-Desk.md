## MSDN Magazine Sept 2009 – What I Read

*   Code Coverage for [Concurrency](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/magazine/ee412257.aspx)
*   Concurrency with Channels, Domains and [Messages](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/magazine/ee412254.aspx) – “experimental C# compiler that provides some interesting and different features, a superset of C# 3.0 (3.0 + asynchronous methods), none of which is implied for C# 4.0, by the way. What this does permit, however, is the ability to mix-and-match C# and Axum code in the same project, something unique to Axum so far” 🙂
*   Debugging [Task-Based](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/magazine/ee410778.aspx) Parallel Applications in Visual Studio 2010
*   What’s New in the [Base Class Libraries](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/magazine/ee428166.aspx) in .NET Framework 4
*   Charting with [DataTemplates](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/magazine/ee413725.aspx)
*   The Tao of Screen [Design](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/magazine/ee413547.aspx)
