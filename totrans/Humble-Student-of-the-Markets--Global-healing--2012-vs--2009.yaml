    as equities. First, because the market didn't collapse in 2011 as it did in 2008,
    it would be foolhardy to ascribe near triple digit returns for equities going
    forward. If there are no accidents, such as a US recession, or a Chinese hard
    landing, investors should enjoy either high single digit or low double digit returns
    from a diversified stock portfolio.

    collapse, we just go back to worrying about earnings, recessions, growth, interest
    rates, etc. Bimodal distributions are much more difficult for professional managers
    to deal with because there is a single decision or event that can lead the market
    in two different directions. Will X default? Will the FDA decision be favorable
    for the company? How will the court rule in this key case that affects the survival
    of the company? It was largely these circumstances that led to the poor hedge
    fund and professional manager performance in 2011.

    much easier for professional investors to deal with. Modern portfolio theory is
    based on bell-shaped return distribution functions. Managers are well trained
    to manage risk in such situations and virtually everyone does it well.
