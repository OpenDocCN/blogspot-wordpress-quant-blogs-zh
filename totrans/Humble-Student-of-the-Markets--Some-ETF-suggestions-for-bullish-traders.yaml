    traders should focus on high momentum stocks and sectors for their long positions

    ETF suggestions are based on my sector and industry momentum screens and I would
    caution that some of the ETFs are correlated with each other, so it may not be
    appropriate to overly weight any two correlated sectors or industries.

    stocks have moved to a leadership position in the last few months. The sector
    got a little over-extended and has pulled back on a relative basis. Current levels
    may provide a good entry point for long positions.

- en: One surprise that came out of my relative strength and leadership screen were
    Canadian stocks. As Canadian stocks are more heavily weighted in the resource
    sector and in energy in particular, EWC is somewhat correlated to XLE and therefore
    partly represents the energy overweight theme that I mentioned above. On the other
    hand, EWC is a more broadly diversified index with other sector exposures and
    it may represent a less risky way of taking an energy overweight position than
    a simple long position in XLE.

    with the market, which made me question the strength and sustainability of the
    economic rebound. However, the cyclically and capital goods sensitive semiconductor
    industry has been a notable exception. While the group is a bit over-extended
    on a relative basis and could pull back at any time, semiconductors (SMH) represent
    a solid momentum pick for bullish traders.

    are correlated, but Tech stocks recently staged a relative upside breakout in
    the context of a relative uptrend.

    in March and early April, but they have gradually recovered. This is an indication
    that the animal spirits of risk appetite is returning. If you are a bullish trader,
    IBB could be your vehicle.

    Some of the sectors and industry ETFs that I mentioned are prime candidates for
    long positions for bullishly inclined traders.
