    long one instrument and short another one as a hedge. In many hedge funds, these
    are the only strategies that are allowed: investors imagine that only market-neutral
    hedge funds can deliver consistent returns in bull and bear markets alike, and

    favor of market neutral strategies is misplaced in several ways.

    long-only strategy at a lower leverage, but that is often simpler in design and
    that incurs lower transaction costs (since there is only one-side of the trade
    to execute)?

    money in bear markets. This is probably true when you are holding overnight --
    but long-only day-trading strategies are often profitable in both bull and bear
    markets.

    is a strategy that buys an index at its 10-day low, and exit when... well, there
    are multiple ways to exit and most of them work! If you try the mirror image of
    this strategy, i.e. short an index at its 10-day high, it works far less well.
    This simply reflects the positive mean return of the equity market, and why not
    take advantage of that?

    because the short instrument is actually quite different in nature than the long
    one, despite their superficial similarity. An

    will begin which drives the price of gasoline futures up, and the demand for heating
    will decrease which drives the price of heating oil futures down. This hedged
    trade is supposed to eliminate general energy market risk. However, the weather
    is sometimes unpredictable, and in 2005, this trade went quite wrong primarily
    because the winter lasted longer. On the other hand, if you only enter the long
    side of this trade, i.e. buy gasoline futures in the spring, it works like a charm
    every year in the past 10 years! (I have posted a detailed analysis of this long-only

    only for market-neutral strategies, there is no need to be bounded by the same
    rules that they have to play by.
