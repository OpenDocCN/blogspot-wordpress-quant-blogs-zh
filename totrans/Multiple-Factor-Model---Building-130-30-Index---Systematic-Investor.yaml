    New Long-Only (2008) by A. Lo, P. Patel](http://math.nyu.edu/faculty/avellane/Lo13030.pdf)
    paper in his comment to the [Multiple Factor Model – Building CSFB Factors](https://systematicinvestor.wordpress.com/2012/02/13/multiple-factor-model-building-csfb-factors/)
    post. This paper presents a very detailed step by step guide to building 130/30
    Index using average CSFB Factors as the alpha model and [MSCI Barra Multi-Factor
    Risk model](http://www.alacra.com/alacra/help/barra_handbook_US.pdf). Today, I
    want to adapt this methodology and to show how to build 130/30 Index based on
    the CSFB Factors we created in the [Multiple Factor Model – Building CSFB Factors](https://systematicinvestor.wordpress.com/2012/02/13/multiple-factor-model-building-csfb-factors/)
    post and the Risk Model we created in the [Multiple Factor Model – Building Risk

    Factor Model – Building CSFB Factors](https://systematicinvestor.wordpress.com/2012/02/13/multiple-factor-model-building-csfb-factors/)
    post. [If you are missing data.factors.Rdata file, please execute fm.all.factor.test()
    function first to create and save CSFB factors.] Next, let’s load the multiple
    factor risk model we saved at the end of the [Multiple Factor Model – Building
    Risk Model](https://systematicinvestor.wordpress.com/2012/02/21/multiple-factor-model-building-risk-model/)
    post. [If you are missing risk.model.Rdata file, please execute fm.risk.model.test()
    function first to create and save multiple factor risk model.] Next, I will compute
    betas over a two-year rolling window.
