- en: Super-regionals, regionals and local banks can focus on particular sets of needs
    and work on becoming the world leaders in that niche. In the process, they become
    valued customers of the tier one banks. There is a natural tension in this relationship,
    but they need each other, and both know it. The smaller banks need liquidity with
    tight spreads, and the larger banks need profitable flow. But relationships have
    to be considered in every routing decision. The better the mid-tier partners with
    their liquidity providers to make sure the flow is economically helpful to both
    sides, the more they’ll be able to consistently serve their own clients.
