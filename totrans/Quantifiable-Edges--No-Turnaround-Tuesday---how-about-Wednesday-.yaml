    the market makes 3 down days going in to Tuesday there has been a decided upside
    edge. Well, that edge certainly did not play out Tuesday. So what happens when
    Turnaround Tuesday fails to ignite a turnaround? I went back to 1980 for this
    test to get a good number of instances.

    rather than a bad omen.
