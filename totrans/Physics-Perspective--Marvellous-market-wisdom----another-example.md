From Matthew Klein at Bloomberg,

[Is Yahoo's Business Worth Less Than Nothing?](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-03-17/is-yahoo-s-business-worth-less-than-nothing)

, a graph showing how the values of Yahoo and its various key holdings, as assessed by the wise market, somehow just don't add up.

As Barry Ritholz comments:

> Yahoo! Inc.’s total value is represented by the first bar. If you subtract the value of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Yahoo! Japan Corp. you are left with Yahoo's core business -- excluding its Japanese and Chinese investments -- and a negative valuation.
> I can remember a few examples of the efficient, all-knowing markets getting the valuation of a company completely wrong. It doesn’t happen often, but it's kind of amusing when it does.
> 
> Maybe Marissa Mayer isn't doing a terrible job, but Mr. Market simply made a mistake. This chart should make you question whether we give markets too much credit for being efficient and intelligent.
