- en: Bob Hodrick was chairman of the Northwestern Finance department when I was there
    back in 1994, and was completely indifferent to my  dissertation on the negative
    relation between idiosyncratic returns and stock returns. Befitting academics,
    his subsequent landmark 2006 paper emphasized a new risk factor based on a stock's
    covariance with volatility innovations. This is standard stochastic discount function
    asset pricing, looking for more subtle risk factors that could save the paradigm.
    What they found here was obviously boring because no one mentions that angle,
    but rather the incidental mention that simple stock variance was hugely negatively
    related to returns cross-sectionally.

- en: Consistent with my earlier experience with Hodrick, I imagine he couldn't accept
    the result as real or interesting except in the context of some convoluted risk
    factor explanation, so the seminal academic result had to be packaged as an add-on
    to a 'legitimate' hypothesis, one now recognized as pointless but was initially
    essential. Further, once a major pub mentioned it, one could address it without
    having people simply dismiss it as impossible because, theoretically, it doesn't
    happen; further, explanations could proceed unbounded, as while the introduction
    needed the 'risk factor' farcical explanation, secondary ones did not.

    greatly underperforms, was not an obvious fact in the 1990's even though I tried
    to explain this to people, though I wasn't working within some accepted theoretical
    framework, so my fact was not acknowledged.
  prefs: []

- en: The fact of the negative volatility/idiosyncratic volatility/beta and returns
    is now legitimate, and around 2005 you had several independent institutional funds
    operating on the premise, so clearly the fact was in the air independent of Ang,
    Hodrick, Xing and Zheng. I personally had applied it as a C-corp from 1996 trying
    to get support, and eventually found a way to a hedge fund where I applied it
    at that time. Thus, I'm convinced it's not a figment of measurement error because
    I actually traded it and made money off it, and know people who have large funds
    that have outperformed their benchmarks applying this insight.

    the same results, so all the focus on idiosyncratic makes the result seem much
    less robust than it is.

    though most are well worth reading to make sure.  I'm intrigued by the assertion
    that stocks that have active short interest have a

    non trivial so I'm not sure it's true (I like to see it myself, otherwise I generally
    don't believe it).  These are mainly papers published around 2010 and 2011.
