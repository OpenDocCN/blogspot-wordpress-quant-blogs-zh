- en: We have been asking Coral8 to create a user support forum on their website so
    that Coral8 users can ask questions of eachother. As long as the various financial
    institutions don't share their secret sauce, and as long as the discussions are
    purely technical, then I can imagine that all of the Coral8 users in the various
    IB's would participate. In particular, I would like to see the sharing of patterns,
    query optimizations, and adapter functionality.
