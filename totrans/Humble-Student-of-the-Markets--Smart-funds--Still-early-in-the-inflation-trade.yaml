    Usually, if you are long the inflation (Energy and Materials) bet, you are short
    the bond market. The experience of the 1970s showed that if inflation wins, bondholders
    lose.

    term, inflation is here and rising. Moreover, the Fed is behind the curve in its
    inflation fight. It is further handcuffed by the fragility of the financial system
    (hence the underweight position in Financials). In the short term, the combination
    of the cyclical effects of the economic slowdown and the Fed’s focus on core inflation,
    which appears relatively benign, will serve to put a lid on long rates (and therefore
    the long bond bet).

    early in the trade. The long bond exposure implies that inflationary expectations
    remain contained and are not yet ready to rise.****
