- en: One of the more profound facts of life is nonlinearity.  From radiation to vitamins
    to things like politeness and honesty, optimality lies in some middle ground.
     You can have too much or too little, which is what makes life non-trivial, because
    you always have to find that middle optimal point yourself, often by trial and
    error.  The optimal organization for a family is communist, but this doesn't generalize
    to large societies, a point that most leftists can't fathom.

    in the recent crisis, and in the quiet 1935-2005 period Europe had nothing like
    Glass-Steagall without adverse consequence.  It's a red herring.  The key is simply
    the size of financial institutions, which at a certain level become politicized.
     Eliminating Glass-Steagall would just prevent efficient economies of scope.

     His specialty was simply buying other companies.  His knowledge of how various
    regulations affect the macroeconomy, or how they affect a company''s risk, is
    at the level of your average fortune 500 CEO: banal.'

    better than everyone in the group.  Yet for large groups, leaders are quite clueless.
     I remember working for executives at KeyCorp, and the big joke was always how
    to dumb down things for our CEO and the management committee.  They were hopelessly
    clueless about the most basic relationships between interest rates and our basic
    business, or risk factors on our book.  Consider that Bob Rubin was on the management
    committee at CitiCorp, and after pulling in $115MM,

    important in the mortgage fiasco, and they too are so oblivious they rarely even
    bother to comment upon it.  They were merely for more home ownership, which given
    enough cognitive dissonance is totally unrelated to the eventual result that no
    money down mortgages were being given to people without income documentation.

- en: In my experience, CEOs and politicians with tens of thousands of subjects are
    much less competent than leaders of organizations with 10 to 100 people.  The
    big leaders are very good at politics and public relations, necessary skills,
    but ones I personally don't find very interesting or admirable, mainly because
    platitudes and insincerity are so common in that realm.
