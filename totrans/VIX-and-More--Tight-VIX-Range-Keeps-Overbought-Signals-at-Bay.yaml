    was just the kind of post that I suspected would raise quite a few eyebrows, until
    everyone concluded that the headline was out of proportion to the actual data
    point. Ironically, that was a large part of the intent of the post: to poke fun
    at statistical outliers and extreme readings that have dubious predictive value.'

    is a good segue to a more important related point: that a narrow trading range
    for the VIX – and also for stocks in general (10-day [historical volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/historical%20volatility)
    in the SPX is down into the 12s) is allowing for stocks to rise without triggering
    any overbought signals.'

- en: One way I track whether the VIX is signaling an overbought or oversold condition
    is to use a ratio of the VIX to its 10-day moving average. To make this easy on
    the eyes, I am partial to using [moving average envelopes](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/moving%20average%20envelopes)
    (MAEs) which quickly flag when the VIX (or any other underlying) has strayed a
    large distance from its moving average, similar to the manner in which [Bollinger
    bands](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Bollinger%20bands) measure
    outliers.

    and set the MAEs to 10%, 12.5% or 15%, depending upon the underlying volatility
    in the market. In the chart below, I have set the MAEs to 10 days and 12.5%. The
    result is a VIX that has hugged the center line (the 10-day moving average) for
    the past 2 ½ weeks, never threatening the dotted blue MAE lines.

    in general in the markets: stocks continue to rise, but not rapidly enough to
    trigger many of the favored overbought alarms.'
