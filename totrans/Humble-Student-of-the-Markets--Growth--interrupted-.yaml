- en: Two weeks ago, I rhetorically asked if investors should be buying into the cyclical
    recovery theme (see [Buy the cyclical and reflation trade?](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2020/10/24/buy-the-cyclical-and-reflation-trade/)).
    Global green shoots of recovery were appearing, but I identified the "uncertainty
    of additional fiscal stimulus" as a key risk to the cyclical rebound thesis. Now
    that Biden appears to be winning the White House, but constrained by a Republican-controlled
    Senate, it's time to revisit the recovery question.

    NAFTA, Europe, and Asia dominated by China. It is within that framework that I
    examine the global reflation question.
