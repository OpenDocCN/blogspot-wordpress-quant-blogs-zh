    and the PLA has not taken control. The scenes from the protests are reminiscent
    of the recent US riots in Ferguson, but the Ferguson riots did not directly challenge
    Washington's authority while the HK protests represent an existential threat to
    the Party. Such dissent will not be tolerated.
