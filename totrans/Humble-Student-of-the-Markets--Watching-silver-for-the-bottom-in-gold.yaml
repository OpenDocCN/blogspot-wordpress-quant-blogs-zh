- en: Personally, I would be inclined to step aside for now and watch how this trade
    develops. Gold could have great upside potential once it bottoms, but prudence
    calls for waiting for some signs of stabilization before getting long. I would
    rather miss the first 10-20% move than lose another 50% should I get long prematurely.

    a falling silver/gold ratio is flashing a caution signal. The chart below shows
    the silver/gold ratio as the solid line and the gold price as the candlestick
    chart. If silver is the high-beta version of gold, i.e. the poor man's gold, why
    is the silver/gold ratio continuing to fall here?

- en: The most charitable explanation that 2013 corresponds to the 2001 gold bottom,
    where the silver/gold ratio continued to fall. As the gold price stabilized, rallied
    and then fell back to test the bottom, the silver/gold ratio stabilized, though
    it was several months late in confirming the start of the secular gold bull.

    of a multi-decade secular gold bear market. Today, the price of gold peaked out
    in late 2012 and fell back below important technical levels after a long bull
    market.

    don''t be so sure about the intermediate term trend. There may be more downside
    to come. We''ll just have to watch and wait to see how some of these technical
    patterns resolve themselves.'
