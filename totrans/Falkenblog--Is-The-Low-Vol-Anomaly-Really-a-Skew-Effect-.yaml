    stocks is difficult for economists to digest, because it's so hard to square with
    standard theory.  It brings to mind Dostoyevsky's line "If God is dead, then everything
    is permitted." Similarly, when one sees their favored theory as being abandoned,
    it seems like all explanation is lost and chaos reigns. Yet, when a wrong theory
    is adopted, well, as the ever-logical Bertrand Russel used to note, if 1+1=1,
    everything is both true and untrue.  We need a framework to evaluate reality,
    and it has to be consistent.

    is used to motivate the hypothesis that a security’s skewness in the distribution

    return distribution has a right, upper, tail is longer than its left tail—will
    be overpriced relative to the price it would command in an economy with standard
