    [Harris](http://www.tradingandexchanges.com) on trustworthiness. Confused reads
    Harris as explaining the enforcement of standards of behaviour in the market as
    by contract, rather than covenant. I haven''t read all of Harris yet, and I''m
    expecting him to say something on the ''my word is my bond'' market ethos, which

  zh: '[困惑](http://www.confusedofcalcutta.com/)正在探索[哈里斯](http://www.tradingandexchanges.com)关于可信度的问题。困惑认为哈里斯解释了市场行为标准的执行是通过合同，而不是契约。我还没有读完哈里斯的全部内容，我期待他能就“我的话就是我的债券”的市场道德观念发表一些看法，这种道德观念更多的是契约而非合同。'
- en: So how does that ethos work in the markets ?  A buy side trader calls a dealer
    for a quote, and the dealer says '20/25'. The buy side trader says '50 yours'
    and the dealer says 'done'. At that point they've traded, but the deal has yet
    to be confirmed by the back offices, so they're not bound by contract yet. If
    either side subsequently reneges on the trade, they're violating the ethos. Dealers
    will refuse to quote to a trader who reneges, and a dealer who doesn't honour
    those trades won't get much business. Both parties have to trust each other until
    the trade is confirmed. That relationship of trust allows accommodation. Some
    time back I was on the trading floor helping one of our dealers diagnose an electronic
    trade on a quote driven market that had RFQed at the wrong price. He called up
    the counterparty, and they amended the trade price in our favour. Obviously the
    counterparty valued his relationship with his dealer more than a couple of basis
    points on the trade.

  zh: 那么这种道德观念在市场中是如何运作的呢？买方交易员给经销商打电话询问报价，经销商说“20/25”。买方交易员说“50给你”，经销商说“成交”。在这一点上他们已经完成了交易，但交易尚未由后台办公室确认，所以他们还没有受到合同的约束。如果任何一方随后撤销交易，他们就违反了这种道德观念。经销商将拒绝向撤销交易的交易员报价，并且不尊重那些交易的经销商将不会得到很多业务。双方必须彼此信任，直到交易得到确认。这种信任关系允许适应。前段时间我曾在交易大厅帮助我们的一个经销商诊断一个在报价驱动市场中以错误价格进行电子交易的案例。他给对手方打电话，他们修改了对我们有利的交易价格。显然，对手方重视他与经销商的关系，胜过交易中几基点的好处。
- en: An instructive recent example of the violation of these implicit trust relationships
    between market participants was [Citigroup](http://www.citigroup.com/citigroup/homepage/)'s
    [MTS raid](http://www.euroweek.com/default.asp?Page=1&SID=436395&ISS=11029). They
    drove EuroGovies down with a massive wave of selling, then bought them all back,
    profiting by £14M in the process. They didn't breach any specific rules, but as
    the story explains " the FSA … is likely to examine the trade with an eye on its
    very loosely defined rules against behaviour that distorts the market".

  zh: 另一句显著的名言是：“现在看来很清楚，花旗集团打破了一种禁忌——但与许多市场惯例不同，这种禁忌不是任何人都能在事件发生前描述或制定的。”
- en: To understand what taboo was broken, you have to know that [MTS](http://www.euromts-ltd.com/)
    as a market has a special position in the Euro Govt bond markets. It's an inter
    dealer market where issuers conduct primary market operations. MTS is based in
    Milan, and is used by the Italian, and other European governments, to issue new
    debt to the market. Only select dealers get to participate in those auctions of
    new debt. The right to participate in the primary market auctions is earned by
    taking quoting obligations. That is by quoting EuroGovies five hours a day. Those
    quoting obligations ensure that there is always dealer supplied liquidity available
    so that European governments can conduct treasury operations; for example buying
    debt back from the market.

  zh: 要理解打破了什么禁忌，你必须知道[MTS](http://www.euromts-ltd.com/)作为一个市场在欧元政府债券市场中占有特殊地位。它是一个发行商进行一级市场操作的场外交易市场。MTS总部位于米兰，意大利和其他欧洲政府使用它向市场发行新债务。只有选定的交易商才能参与那些新债务的拍卖。参与一级市场拍卖的权利是通过承担报价义务获得的。这就是说，每天报价欧元政府债券五小时。这些报价义务确保始终有交易商提供的流动性，以便欧洲政府可以进行财政操作；例如从市场上购买回债务。
- en: Another thing that it's important to understand about MTS is that it's a hybrid
    market. It's not entirely a quote driven market like [Bloomberg](http://www.bloomberg.com),
    and not entirely a limit order book market like [Eurex](http://www.eurexchange.com/index.html).
    Market participants are divided into market makers and market takers. Markets
    makers send proposals, which are tradeable firm quotes, unlike the indicative
    quotes of Bloomberg or TradeWeb. Market takers place orders, much as they would
    on an order driven market. Proposals can cross with orders. However orders cannot
    cross with orders, so market takers have to trade with market makers, as they
    do in a quote driven market. Proposals can cross with proposals too.

  zh: 关于MTS的另一个重要理解是，它是一个混合市场。它不是完全由报价驱动的市场，如[彭博社](http://www.bloomberg.com)，也不是完全由限价订单簿市场，如[欧洲期货交易所](http://www.eurexchange.com/index.html)。市场参与者分为市场制造商和市场接受者。市场制造商发送提案，这些是可交易的坚定报价，与彭博社或TradeWeb的指示性报价不同。市场接受者下订单，就像他们在订单驱动市场上一样。提案可以与订单交叉。然而，订单不能与订单交叉，所以市场接受者必须与市场制造商交易，就像他们在报价驱动市场中一样。提案也可以与提案交叉。
- en: Since market maker proposals are firm quotes, they are implemented in a transactional
    fashion, unlike the quotes on true quote driven markets like Bloomberg. Bloomberg's
    MPF spec specifies that quoting systems should expect an ack once every three
    quotes, roughly. On Bloomberg, the client doesn't get a tradeable price until
    an RFQ is initiated, and the quoting system sends a firm price. Since any market
    taker can trade a market maker's proposal, market makers must know what they're
    showing on the market at any given instance. Their systems can only know that
    with certainty because of the transactional model built around getting a quote
    on the market.

  zh: 由于市场制造商的报价是坚定报价，它们以交易方式实施，与彭博社等真正报价驱动市场的报价不同。彭博社的MPF规范规定，报价系统应每三份报价期望一次确认，大致如此。在彭博社上，客户在发起RFQ（请求报价）后才能获得可交易价格，报价系统发送一个坚定价格。由于任何市场接受者都可以与市场制造商的提案交易，市场制造商必须知道他们在任何给定时刻向市场展示的内容。他们的系统只有通过围绕在市场上获得报价的交易模型才能确切知道这一点。
- en: That transactional model has implications. To refresh a proposal a new transaction
    must be opened for that instrument. That can't be done until the previous transaction
    has completed. And there's a limit on the number of open transactions a market
    maker can have. So if a market maker is obliged to quote 300 govt bonds, and they
    can only have 50 open transactions at any instanct, they have major bottleneck
    if the market starts to move quickly. Market makers can be left badly exposed,
    with stale proposals out on the market.

  zh: 那种交易模式有其影响。要刷新一个提案，必须为该工具开设一个新交易。这必须在之前的交易完成之后才能进行。市场制造商可以同时打开的交易数量有限。因此，如果一个市场制造商有义务报价300个政府债券，而他们在任何时刻只能有50个打开的交易，如果市场开始快速变动，他们就会遇到严重的瓶颈。市场制造商可能会面临严重的风险，市场上的陈旧提案仍然存在。
- en: 'It seems to me that the Citigroup raid was specifically designed to exploit
    those key features of MTS: market maker''s obligation to quote, the hybrid nature
    of the market, and the transactional nature of proposals. But those market features
    were all designed to support government treasury operations. The [Euroweek article](http://www.euroweek.com/default.asp?Page=1&SID=436395&ISS=11029)
    quotes Tom Maheras of Citi as saying the raid was "an innovative transaction that
    sought to access the liquidity in the European government bond markets". Indeed,
    and no wonder the government treasury departments were pissed off !'

  zh: 在我看来，花旗集团的突袭似乎是专门设计来利用MTS的关键特性：市场制造商的报价义务、市场的混合性质以及提案的交易性质。但是，这些市场特性都是为了支持政府财政运作而设计的。《Euroweek文章》（[欧元周报文章](http://www.euroweek.com/default.asp?Page=1&SID=436395&ISS=11029)）引用了花旗集团的Tom
    Maheras的话，称这次突袭是“一种创新的交易，旨在接入欧洲政府债券市场的流动性”。的确，难怪政府财政部门会感到愤怒！
