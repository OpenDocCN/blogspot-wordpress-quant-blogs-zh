# VIX and More: Direxion and S&P Bring Dynamic Volatility Hedging to ETFs with VEQTOR

As the ETF space continues to evolve and push into new territory, such as [strategy-in-a-box ETFs](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Strategy-in-a-Box%20ETFs) and more [actively managed ETFs](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/actively%20managed%20ETFs) (e.g., [QAI](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/QAI), [ALT](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/ALT), [PQY](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/PQY), [PQZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/PQZ), [GVT](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/GVT), [PSR](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/PSR), [RWG](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/RWG)), it was only a matter of time before a volatility play was added to the pool of actively managed ETFs.

Credit [Direxion](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Direxion) with being the first to venture into the realm of actively managed ETFs with a strong volatility component. In a [recent SEC filing](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1496646/000089418910002506/ds-etf_s1.htm), Direxion unveiled plans to launch an intriguing new ETF under the name of S&P 500 Dynamic VEQTOR Shares. This ETF will seek to track the [S&P 500 Dynamic VEQTOR Index](http://www.standardandpoors.com/indices/sp-500-dynamic-veqtor-index/en/us/?indexId=spsvixevl-usd----t-us-l--), which was [launched](http://www.standardandpoors.com/servlet/BlobServer?blobheadername3=MDT-Type&blobcol=urldata&blobtable=MungoBlobs&blobheadervalue2=inline%3B+filename%3D20091118_500_Dynamic_VEQTOR-Launch.pdf&blobheadername2=Content-Disposition&blobheadervalue1=application%2Fpdf&blobkey=id&blobheadername1=content-type&blobwhere=1243623196434&blobheadervalue3=UTF-8) by S&P back on November 18, 2009.

So far, so good.

Here is where it gets interesting. The [VEQTOR](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VEQTOR) index (and ETF) have three components: equity (S&P 500); volatility (S&P 500 Short-Term VIX Futures Index, aka [VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX)) and cash. Based upon several rules and formulas, the index attempts to derive – on a daily basis – the ideal target volatility allocation. This is accomplished by evaluating [realized volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/realized%20volatility) and [implied volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/implied%20volatility), determining the implied volatility trend (using 5-day and 20-day IV moving averages) and arriving at a target index volatility allocation based on realized volatility and implied volatility data. Once the target volatility allocation has been determined (the range is from 2.5% to 40.0%), the balance of the index is populated with the S&P 500.

Just to make things more interesting, the VEQTOR index also has a stop loss provision which specifies that if aggregate losses during any five day business period are 2% or higher, the index will move into a 100% cash position.

When the VEQTOR ETF is launched, I will have a lot more to say about this fascinating product. In the meantime, those interested in additional information on the VEQTOR index and ETF should try:
