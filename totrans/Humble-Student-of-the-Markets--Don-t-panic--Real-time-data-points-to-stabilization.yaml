    a composite of the stock of Staffing and Temp Agencies and compared their performance
    relative to the S&P 500\. As the chart below shows, this group has broken out
    of a relative downtrend. More importantly, this group doesn’t seem to be totally
    falling apart despite the dire headlines hitting the mainstream media. The chart
    indicates that the group has only retreated to a relative support zone dating
    back from 2003-5.
