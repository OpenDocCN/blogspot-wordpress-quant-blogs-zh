    I am always reminded of Jeff Pietsch of **[ETF Rewind](http://etfrewind.blogspot.com/)**who
    is the real wizard behind the curtain in programming the **DV Indicators Excel
    Plug-In**–and besides that is an incredibly smart guy. One can only imagine the
    amount of time and effort (and headaches!) that went into dealing with both me
    and my cumbersome calculations. (Both of us can be a handful!)  But he managed
    to get everything right down to the last decimal place.

    RSI variant that shifts dynamically between 2 and 30 days to account for the degree
    of choppiness in the market. The “Fractal RSI” is a Level 1 adaptive indicator:
    it adjusts for market conditions but it is not self-aware. Level 2 adaptation
    represents the ability of an indicator to understand the components of its own
    sources of profitability. Note that this is not the same thing as optimization,
    nor is it the use of a timing mechanism to trade the equity curve. A Level 2 adapter
    such as the Adaptive RSI (DVAR) will shift weightings between trend and countertrend
    as well as across parameter lengths from 2 to a maximum of 30 if necessary. It
    observes the distribution of profitability to adjust the indicator output. It
    cannot handle adjustments for current market conditions like the Fractal RSI.
    However it can better understand how a given market behaves. Below is an interesting
    test where we run the DVAR on  both the Nasdaq Composite and the S&P500 Index
    going back to 1974\. We allow the DVAR to do its thing and generate buy and sell
    signals and simply trade the market that has the highest combination of 12/6 month
    total return.  No timing was used to trade the equity curve. ***The result was
    a frictionless compound return of 33.68% over the 35-year backtest.*** There were
    only two losing years: 2003 and 2004 and for those of you who have done a lot
    of testing–there are a lot of systems that did well over the same time period,
    *including the Fractal RSI!* This brings me to my final point, which is that using
    multiple types of adaptation and/or indicators is the true holy grail to achieving
    consistency—but Level 2 Adaptation always helps :o)[![](img/d765819d68e5c0030228c844bcb0dca4.png
