    I mentioned the widening gap between the VIX's implied volatility and historical
    volatility, IV stood at 85, well below the average IV reading for the past year.
    In the two weeks since that post, IV has fallen all the way down to 75, which
    is now below even pre-[2/27](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/February%2027)
    levels, as the graph below demonstrates.

- en: I am not sure what to make of this other than to observe that we appear to be
    entering another period of meta-complacency. Though the [VWSI](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VWSI)
    is not flashing a signal to buy the VIX yet, this does look like it might be a
    good time to start nibbling.
