- en: When I ask the question “What if the US 10 year goes to 0?", most do not know
    the effect, the catalyst, or if 0 has ever happened before.  The math is fairly
    simple to do in Excel or with an old-school calculator, but let’s use RQuantLib
    to do the pricing and then use LatticeExtra with some slight adjustment in SVG. 
    RQuantLib spits out a total return of 17% if we go to 0 by the end of October,
    which seems like a decent amount until we look at on a chart.

    10 year went very briefly to 0.47%, but we need to remember that was in extended
    deflation in which stocks and real estate lost 90%.  That 17% return if we go
    to 0 (actually much less since ~~0.47%~~ 0.43% was the stopping point) is not
    all that helpful in this devastating environment.

- en: Even more strange is that the move we experienced over the last 15 months is
    greater than the potential move from here to 0.  On a six month change in yield
    chart, the 2% from April to 0% in October seems perfectly normal if we forget
    about the starting point.

    yield, ending yield/starting yield is more appropriate at this critical level. 
    Now we can see how unusual the move really is.

    of the world”, please be aware that best case you make a fairly measly 17%.  Just
    moving back to where we were Spring 2011 would mean a bigger loss than the absolute
    best case.
