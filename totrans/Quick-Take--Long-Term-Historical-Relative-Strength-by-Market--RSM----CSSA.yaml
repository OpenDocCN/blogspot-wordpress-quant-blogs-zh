- en: The first priority in system design is to find a strategy that works consistently
    over time. The second and often overlooked priority in my opinion should be in
    market selection. Now this is a topic that is very broad and covers such factors
    as liquidity and contract sizes as well as how well the personality of the specific
    market matches your own personality. While these subjects are certainly very important,
    what i am referring to for the purposes of this article is to select the market(s)
    that is(are) likely to be the most profitable for your system. For example, using
    the Donchian Channel strategy mentioned in the previous post, after analyzing
    the profitability by market I noticed that some markets are consistently more
    profitable than others. Notable examples are currencies and petro-commodities
    (oil, heating oil and gas). For mean-reversion based strategies using indicators
    like the DV2, the best markets include the  S&P500 and the real estate sector
    index (IYR).

- en: 'The million dollar question is: ” how do we identify these markets beforehand?”
    Well the answer is to simply create a rolling historical analysis of the profitability
    across different market and incorporate that into your strategy. What I am talking
    about is essentially taking a look at the relative strength of the equity curves
    for various markets and adjusting with proper frequency. How do we do this? Here
    are two initial rules:'

- en: 1) If you are using a short-term strategy such as the DV2, RSI2, or a short-term
    moving average, than you should take a look at a 1-3 year  historical relative
    strength by market using a risk-adjusted measure such as the DVR or the Sharpe
    Ratio. Every 2-3 months you should re-evaluate the historical relative strength
    by market. Select the top 2 or 3 markets based on their performance using the
    strategy.

- en: Based on my observations, certain markets seem to persist in exhibiting trending
    or mean-reverting behaviour. As an example, over 10 years ago when i first looked
    at trend-following strategies, the very same markets were the best performers
    at that time  (across a wide range of strategies) were virtually the same in the
    recent 10 year period. In our more detailed work in the stock market, certain
    stocks and sectors demonstrate remarkable persistence using momentum-based strategies.
    For almost 35 years, the technology sector has responded spectacularly well to
    these types of strategies. Fast-forward to 2009, and the tech sector is the best
    perfoming major index in this recent market rally. While markets of course do
    change, this is independent of using a historical relative strength strategy.
    The first priority in designing your systems is to create a robust model that
    also adapts to what is working in the current environment. For example, knowing
    that the current environment favors mean reversion strategies we would select
    the DV2 as our favorite indicator. Given that you have done this, now you would
    look at which markets it has worked the best on, and you would naturally proceed
    to the S&P500, the Japan index (EWJ) or the Real Estate sector (IYR). If you wanted
    to trade medium or longer term moving averages-which still work– you would definitely
    choose the NASDAQ, the Russell 2000, and the commodity index (GSG or DBC).

    knowing that the current environment favors mean reversion strategies 我们会选择DV2作为我们最喜欢的指标。既然你已经做到了这一点，现在你会看看它在哪些市场上表现最好，然后自然而然地选择标普500、日本指数（EWJ）或房地产板块（IYR）。如果你想要交易中短期内移动平均线（这仍然有效），你肯定会选择纳斯达克、罗素2000和商品指数（GSG或DBC）。
