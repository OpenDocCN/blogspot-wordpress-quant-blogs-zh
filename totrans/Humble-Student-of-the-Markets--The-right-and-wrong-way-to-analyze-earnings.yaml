    growth. While that hasn’t happened for earnings since the financial crisis, low
    oil prices, an elevated U.S. dollar and sluggish global growth have all weighed
    on profits this year. Not even a flurry of buybacks was enough to push profits
    into positive territory in the second quarter.

    sources of strength during the current bull market.

    tend to start high and fall over time. This chart from Ed Yardeni shows the past
    patterns of EPS estimates for any single fiscal year (blue squiggles) since 1995\.
    EPS estimates for any single period, whether it's a fiscal year or fiscal quarter,
    start high and have a tendency to fall. It is therefore not unusual at all to
    see estimate revisions stay negative for any single FY or FQ.

    difference. The forward 12 month EPS estimates are far more correlated with stock
    prices than the trailing 12 month EPS, largely because it is forward looking.
