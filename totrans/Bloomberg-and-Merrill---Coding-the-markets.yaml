- en: So there are reports that Merrill may sell its stake in Bloomberg to raise capital.
    Bloomberg is still a private company, and Merrill has had a stake since they became
    Bloomberg’s first customer 20 years ago. Would Bloomberg buy the stake back ? 
    Fixed income dealers recently bought back into TradeWeb in the Fusion project.
    As a result TW is moving away from RFQ to an RFS model, which favours dealers.
    If dealers buy Merrill’s Bloomberg stake, the same could happen there…
