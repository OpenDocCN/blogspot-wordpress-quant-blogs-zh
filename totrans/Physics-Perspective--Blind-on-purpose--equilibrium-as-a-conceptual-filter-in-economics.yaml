    It carried the provocative title "Why Economists Are Right," and argued back against
    all those who were then criticizing economics -- especially the rational expectations
    assumption -- in the aftermath of the financial crisis. Levine's article is delicately
    crafted and sounds superficially convincing. Indeed, it seems to make the rational
    expectations idea almost obvious. His argument is a masterpiece of showmanship
    in the manner of Milton Friedman -- its conclusion seems unavoidable, yet the
    logic seems somehow fishy, though in a way that is hard to pin down.

- en: 'In simple language what rational expectations means is "if people believe this
    forecast it will be true." By contrast if a theory is not one of rational expectations
    it means "if people believe this forecast it will not be true." Obviously such
    a theory has limited usefulness. Or put differently: if there is a correct theory,
    eventually most people will believe it, so it must necessarily be rational expectations.
    Any other theory has the property that people must forever disbelieve the theory
    regardless of overwhelming evidence -- for as soon as the theory is believed it
    is wrong.'

    claim made by the rational expectations assumption? If so, maybe it is reasonable.
    But there's a lot lurking in this paragraph.

    learn over time to hold rational beliefs. In other words, he simply asserts (maybe
    because he believes this) that the only possible outcome in our world has to be
    an equilibrium. If people have certain beliefs, and their actions based on these
    lead to a collective outcome that

    but ongoing change. From this, Levine

    lead to actions and collective outcomes that confirm these beliefs and bring about
    an equilibrium. But this is simply his personal assumption, presumably because
    he likes game theory and has expertise in game theory and so likes to think about
    equilibria.

    adjust their beliefs, act differently, and their collective behaviour leads to
    another outcome that against does not confirm their beliefs (at least not perfectly),
    so they adjust again. And there's an ongoing dance and co-evolution between beliefs
    and outcomes that never settles into any equilibrium.

- en: 'One of the earliest insights of economics—it certainly goes back to Smith—is
    that aggregate patterns [in the economy] form from individual behavior, and individual
    behavior in turn responds to these aggregate patterns: there is a recursive loop.
    It is this recursive loop that connects with complexity. Complexity is not a theory
    but a movement in the sciences that studies how the interacting elements in a
    system create overall patterns, and how these overall patterns in turn cause the
    interacting elements to change or adapt. It might study how individual cars together
    act to form patterns in traffic, and how these patterns in turn cause the cars
    to alter their position. Complexity is about formation—the formation of structures—and
    how this formation affects the objects causing it.'

    then would mean asking how it evolves, and this means examining in detail how
    individual agents’ behaviors together form some outcome and how this might in
    turn alter their behavior as a result. Complexity in other words asks how individual
    behaviors might react to the pattern they together create, and how that pattern
    would alter itself as a result. This is often a difficult question; we are asking
    how a process is created from the purposed actions of multiple agents. **And so
    economics early in its history took a simpler approach, one more amenable to mathematical
    analysis. It asked not how agents’ behaviors would react to the aggregate patterns
    these created, but what behaviors (actions, strategies, expectations) would be
    upheld by—would be consistent with—the aggregate patterns these caused. It asked
    in other words what patterns would call for no changes in micro-behavior, and
    would therefore be in stasis, or equilibrium.** (General equilibrium theory thus
    asked what prices and quantities of goods produced and consumed would be consistent
    with—would pose no incentives for change to—the overall pattern of prices and
    quantities in the economy’s markets. Classical game theory asked what strategies,
    moves, or allocations would be consistent with—would be the best course of action
    for an agent (under some criterion)—given the strategies, moves, allocations his
    rivals might choose. And rational expectations economics asked what expectations
    would be consistent with—would on average be validated by—the outcomes these expectations
    together created.)

    and render them open to mathematical analysis. It was an understandable—even proper—way
    to push economics forward. And it achieved a great deal. ...  But there has been
    a price for this equilibrium finesse. Economists have objected to it—to the neoclassical
    construction it has brought about—on the grounds that it posits an idealized,
    rationalized world that distorts reality, one whose underlying assumptions are
    often chosen for analytical convenience. I share these objections. Like many economists
    I admire the beauty of the neoclassical economy; but for me the construct is too
    pure, too brittle—too bled of reality. It lives in a Platonic world of order,
    stasis, knowableness, and perfection. Absent from it is the ambiguous, the messy,
    the real.

    Levine is happy with rational expectations because he is willing to restrict his
    field of interest only to those very few special cases in which peoples' expectations
    do correspond to collective outcomes. Anything else he thinks is uninteresting.
    I'm not even sure that Levine realizes he has so restricted his field of interest
    only to equilibrium, thereby neglecting the much larger and richer field of phenomena
    outside of it.

- en: If we assume equilibrium we place a very strong filter on what we can see in
    the economy. Under equilibrium by definition there is no scope for improvement
    or further adjustment, no scope for exploration, no scope for creation, no scope
    for transitory phenomena, so anything in the economy that takes adjustment—adaptation,
    innovation, structural change, history itself—must be bypassed or dropped from
    theory. The result may be a beautiful structure, but it is one that lacks authenticity,
    aliveness, and creation.
