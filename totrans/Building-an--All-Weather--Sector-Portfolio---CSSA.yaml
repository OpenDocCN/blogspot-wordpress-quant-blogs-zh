- en: 'The central concept of the [“All-Weather” portfolio](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2012/11/07/the-all-weather-portfolio-derivation/
    "The “All-Weather” Portfolio Derivation") is balance: having an allocation that
    will perform equally well across different economic regimes.  The original portfolio
    balances portfolio risk and performance with broad asset classes to be neutral
    to changes in  economic growth and inflation.This basic concept can be extended
    to create an “All-Weather” equity sector portfolio. One of the traditional ways
    to look at sector rotation  is to use the economic “business-cycle” to determine
    which sectors are the most favorable. In this view, the economy goes through four
    distinct phases that progress in sequential order and repeat in a multi-year cycle:
    1) early 2) mid 3) late and 4) recession. In this context, economic growth is
    highest at the earliest stages and the rate of change declines as the business
    cycle progresses. Inflation is low at the earliest stages and builds over time
    to the point where there is “over-heating” at the late stage prior to a recession
    where inflationary pressures cool down.   Fidelity has [conducted a study](https://www.fidelity.com/viewpoints/how-to-use-business-cycle)
    spanning over 50 years to determine the sectors that perform best in each stage.
    Below is a graphic (*Source:* Fidelity Asset Allocation Research) that depicts
    the business cycle and the expected relative sector performance by stage:'

- en: The [results of the study](https://www.fidelity.com/viewpoints/how-to-use-business-cycle)
    indicate some very robust and significant differences in sector performance. ***The
    problem with applying this approach is that there is considerable uncertainty
    as to both which stage the economy is at in a given point of time and how long
    the current business cycle will last (they can vary from 6 months to several years)*.**
    It therefore makes logical sense  to create a sector portfolio that is effectively
    neutral to the business cycle– an **“All-Weather” Sector portfolio**. This can
    be accomplished by generating four different portfolios that perform the best
    in each stage of the cycle and then weight them to account for differences in
    stage length and performance. The resulting portfolio should perform very well
    over time with greater consistency than a more naaive allocation.

- en: 'To create the “All-Weather” Sector Portfolio, I used a simple scoring system
    to capture relative differences in sector and stage performance. The choice of
     using a ranking/scoring model in favor of the actual data avoids the noise associated
    with using past sector returns and also the historical stage of cycle lengths
    which can be more difficult to extrapolate in terms of raw magnitude. Theoretically,
    the relative favorability and length of cycle should be more stable. Both the
    length of stage and relative performance by stage are ranked (highest to lowest).
    The cumulative weight is generating by multiplying the length ranking by the relative
    performance ranking. This determines the relative weighting of each of the four
    portfolios (early, mid, late and recession). Within each portfolio, each sector
    is assigned a score according to relative favorability. A score of 3 is given
    to the historically best performing sector for a given stage, a score of 2 is
    given to sectors that have outperformed significantly, a score of 1 is given to
    sectors that have neutral performance (match the market) and a score of 0 is given
    to sectors that have historically under-performed the market. I have compiled
    a [All Weather Sector Worksheet](https://cssanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/all-weather-sector-worksheet.xlsx) to
    show the breakdown of the calculations in greater detail. Below is the final composite
    and allocation breakdown of the “All-Weather” Sector Portfolio:'

  zh: 要创建“全天候”行业组合，我使用了一个简单的评分系统来捕捉行业和阶段表现的相对差异。选择使用排名/评分模型而不是实际数据，可以避免使用过去的行业回报和历史阶段周期长度所带来的噪音，这在原始幅度上更难以推断。理论上，相对有利性和周期长度应该更加稳定。阶段长度和相对表现均排名（从高到低）。通过将长度排名乘以相对表现排名，产生累积权重。这决定了四个组合（早期、中期、晚期和衰退）的相对权重。在每个组合内，根据相对有利性，为每个行业分配一个分数。对于给定阶段，历史上表现最佳的行业得到3分，显著表现的行业得到2分，表现中性（匹配市场）的行业得到1分，历史上表现低于市场的行业得到0分。我编制了一个[全天候行业工作表](https://cssanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/all-weather-sector-worksheet.xlsx)来更详细地展示计算的细节。以下是“全天候”行业组合的最终复合和分配细节：
