- en: UX Magazine has an interesting [article](http://uxmag.com/articles/how-to-create-an-enterprise-ui-toolkit)
    on “How to Create an Enterprise UI Toolkit”.  Unsurprising to find [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/)
    referenced.  Nathan also offers a [view](http://www.uie.com/articles/design_library/),
    but this time references by [pattern](http://www.uie.com/brainsparks/2009/01/21/spoolcast-achieving-pattern-and-component-reuse-with-nathan-curtis/)
    library and component library.  In my view, for any sizeable UX project, you need
    an appropriate UX [component](http://www.eightshapes.com/blog/2010/08/02/8-principles-of-great-ux-standards-programs/)
    [library](http://www.slideshare.net/bzipkin/rdvo-building-ux-pattern-libraries)
    at a minimum that should allow the UX design to reuse components (from the [library](http://boxesandarrows.com/so-you-wanna-build-a-library-eh/))
    to build new page chunks without an [explosion](http://www.eightshapes.com/blog/2010/08/02/8-principles-of-great-ux-standards-programs/)
    of customized components are should have really been one and the same.  This additionally
    means than when going to code, the same [component](http://www.uie.com/articles/components_vs_patterns/)
    library can be mapped to CSS or the likes, thereby aligning UX to implementation.
