    last week and I stand by those remarks (see [What market structure tells us about
    where we are in the cycle](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2023/05/07/what-market-structure-tells-us-about-where-we-are-in-the-cycle/)).
    While this is not my base case, I am starting to warm to the scenario of an upside
    breakout to a blow-off top, followed by a market collapse soon afterwards. As
    they say, don't sell a dull market short.
