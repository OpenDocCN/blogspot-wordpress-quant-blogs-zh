    it reacts to events. Last weekend, when the pro-European factions won the Greek
    election, the market rallied on Monday but faded, which was bearish. On the other
    hand, when the FOMC disappointed markets on Wednesday with just an extension of
    Twist, stocks fell initially, rallied and deflated again on an intraday basis
    to end the day with a small loss. That was bullish. This kind of market action
    tells me that neither the bulls nor the bears appear to be in control.

    vs liquid bond returns". In my own research, I describe a short-term trading model,
    whose time horizon is 3-4 days and not useful for anything but short-term trading,
    and a slow turnover long-term model that appears to measure long term institutional
    fund flows. I spent most of my career dealing with institutional investors like
    pension funds. Asset shift decisions tend to be made by committee and once they
    move, they move glacially but the shift is highly persistent.
