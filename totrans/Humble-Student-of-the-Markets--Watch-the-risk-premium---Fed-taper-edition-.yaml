- en: To be honest, I did not expect a December taper. That's because there was no
    consensus at the Fed as to what kind of forward guidance language to give Mr.
    Market so that it wouldn't freak out. The Fed had made it clear that "taper is
    not tightening". In light of the market reaction in the May-September period over
    the possibility of tapering, the Fed had to make it clear that they did not want
    forward rates to rise significantly. One alternative was to state that they would
    lower the unemployment threshold range before considering raising short-term rates,
    another was to explicitly target inflation, etc. There appeared to be no consensus.

    it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal
    funds rate well past the time that the unemployment rate declines below 6-1/2
    percent, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s
    2 percent longer-run goal.

- en: The FOMC statement had also raised economic growth and lowered unemployment
    projection for 2014, which is bullish for the economy and the stock market. Under
    conditions of rising economic growth, rising long rates should not be an impediment
    for stock prices because of the underlying support of rising growth and rising
    earnings.

    conditions are unusual because it is a recovery from a balance-sheet recession
    where deleveraging is occurring. Moreover, the Fed's QE programs have served not
    only to lower interest rates, they compressed risk premiums across the board (see

    the response to changes in risk premium is non-linear.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Here is what I mean. Consider that if EPS rises 10% and the P/E ratio stays
    the same, stock prices will rise 10%. However, if the discount rate, or capitalization
    rate, on expected future earnings changes by 100bp, and the change consists of
    a combination of rising interest rates, e.g. 25bp, and rising risk premium, e.g.
    75bp, then prices can change considerably.

    P/E ratio on the y-axis (P/E = 1/cap rate). Note how the line is depicted as a
    curve. A minor change in the discount rate can affect the P/E ratio disproportionately.
    When rates is low, a small rise in capitalization rate results in a precipitous
    drop in the P/E ratio.

- en: Even if EPS rises, a Fed taper whose market reaction includes rising risk premium,
    can result in conditions where stock prices fall because the positive effects
    of rising earnings are offset by the negative effects of falling P/Es.

    to how the market perceives the Fed's decision to taper. Will the risk premium
    rise? By how much and in what sectors? During the May-September "taperitis" period,
    the Fed's announcement that it was considering tapering caused emerging market
    bond yields to blow out and nearly resulted in an EM currency crisis.

    and finance paper is better by 3 basis points to 5 basis points but in the 7 year
    and 8 year part of the curve paper is as much as 8 basis points tighter. TMT (telecom
    media and technology) is 3 basis points to 4 basis points better. Stocks are rallying
    huge and the funds rate will be at zero for the rest of out lives and maybe even
    our supernatural lives. So what is there to worry about as this is financial nirvana.
