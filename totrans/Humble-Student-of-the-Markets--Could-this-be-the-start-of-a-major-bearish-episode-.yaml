- en: This stock market is oversold on a whole host of indicators. Consider, for example,
    the Zweig Breadth Thrust Indicator. A Zweig Breadth Thrust buy signal occurs when
    the ZBT Indicator surges from an oversold to overbought condition within 10 trading
    days. In the last 10 years, there have been four such buy signals (red dotted
    lines) and numerous oversold conditions (grey lines).

    after a buy signal, though they didn’t always rise in a straight line. In all
    cases, the market has staged a relief rally when the ZBT Indicator has become
    oversold, but oversold markets can become more oversold.

    oversold and experience a deeper drawdown.
