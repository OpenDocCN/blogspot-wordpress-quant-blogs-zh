    many of the points that he makes has been known for quite some time. In the interests

    from sequestration. So why is that such a surprise?

- en: However, against these improving economic fundamentals, we have two important
    offsets. The first offset is the unusually high degree of fiscal drag, which the
    Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates at about 1¾ percent of potential GDP
    in 2013.1 The two most important components of this restraint are the end of the
    payroll tax holiday and the increase in income tax rates this past January, and,
    more recently, the government spending cuts resulting from budget sequestration.

    the Fed was considering a taper. This may be one of the key reasons why the Fed

    rates, especially residential mortgage rates—that has occurred since May. So far
    we don’t have much hard data on how this is affecting the housing sector. But
    data through mid-September generally indicate that the rise in rates has cut into
    the upward momentum of the housing sector.

    fallen from its peak but remains at highly elevated levels. The way I interpret
    this chart is that the fall in debt service burden was largely a function in the
    decline in interest rates. If rates were to "normalize", then the household balance
    sheet may not be as "repaired" as many analysts may think.

    the program began last September. Over this time period, the unemployment rate
    has declined to 7.3 percent from 8.1 percent.4 ***However, at the same time, this
    decline in the unemployment rate overstates the degree of improvement. Other metrics
    of labor market conditions, such as the hiring, job-openings, job-finding rate,
    quits rate and the vacancy-to-unemployment ratio, collectively indicate a much
    more modest improvement in labor market conditions compared to that suggested
    by the decline in the unemployment rate. In particular, it is still hard for those
    who are unemployed to find jobs.*** Currently, there are three unemployed workers
    per job opening, as opposed to an average of two during the period from 2003 to
    2007.

    enough to generate sustained labor market improvement—I don’t think we have yet
    passed that test. The economy has not picked up forward momentum and a 2 percent
    growth rate—even if sustained—might not be sufficient to generate further improvement
    in labor market conditions. ***Moreover, fiscal uncertainties loom very large
    right now as Congress considers the issues of funding the government and raising
    the debt limit ceiling.*** Assuming no change in my assessment of the efficacy
    and costs associated with the purchase program, I’d like to see economic news
    that makes me more confident that we will see continued improvement in the labor
    market. Then I would feel comfortable that the time had come to cut the pace of
    asset purchases.
