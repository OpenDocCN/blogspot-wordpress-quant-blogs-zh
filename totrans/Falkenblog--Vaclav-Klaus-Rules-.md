# Falkenblog: Vaclav Klaus Rules!

At a

[meeting](http://www.klaus.cz/klaus2/asp/clanek.asp?id=88EY96UW9zlp)

with European Parliament, Czech president Vaclav Klaus made the following observation:

> Klaus said that the economic downturns are like a flu: if you don't cure it, it takes 7 days. If you do, it takes a week. He was also surprised that Bastiat's famous fictitious petition from the 19th century - a request by candle producers who wanted to be protected by the government against an unfairly advantaged competitor, the Sun - became real in the EU's decision from November 2008 to add 60% tariffs on Chinese candles.

That is, in contrast to Americans, he understands that doing something is not necessarily better than doing nothing.
