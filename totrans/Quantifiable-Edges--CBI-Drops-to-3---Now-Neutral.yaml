- en: I noted my Capitualtive Breadth Indicator (CBI) rose to extreme territory. It
    hit 12 on the afternoon of March 2nd and peaked at 18 the next afternoon. I showed
    a simple system in that post that went long on a reading of 10 or higher and then
    exited when the CBI closed at 3 or lower.

    south for certain stocks it appears likely to close the day at 3 or 2\. This would
    be the exit signal for the system that was described. Should the S&P manage to
    close above the March 2nd close off 700.82, this trade would end up a winner (up

- en: A CBI of 3 or lower is considered neutral. There is no level for shorting. The
    low CBI simply means the number of stocks with potential rebound energy from capitualtive
    selling is small. It doesn't neccessarily suggest the end of the rally. It does
    mean that further gains are not helped by the bullish implications of a high CBI
    reading.
