# Quantifiable Edges: A Couple More Stats On Massive Gaps

> 来源：[http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2008/09/couple-more-stats-on-massive-gaps.html#0001-01-01](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2008/09/couple-more-stats-on-massive-gaps.html#0001-01-01)

When looking at gaps in the SPY as in my last post, buying a break above the 1st half hour of trading and holding until the end of the day would have resulted in 7 winning trade and 3 losing trades.

Unfortunately losers were much larger than winners as they averaged -2.7%. Winners averaged +1.3%.

5 of the winners occurred when the break happened after 10:30 Eastern.

All of the losers occurred when the break happened between 10 and 10:30 Eastern.

Good luck trading today.
