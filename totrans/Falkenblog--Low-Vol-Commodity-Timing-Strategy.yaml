    returns in general. Looking at he 1992-2011 period, the commodity futures with
    low volatility outperformed those with high volatility by 4.6%. The effects appears
    independent of momentum and contango/backwardization effects.

    highly volatile assets have low, often negative returns, they have such high volatility
    they should simply be shunned: a 0.1 Sharpe strategy is a bad long AND short.
    Nonetheless, a good prejudice for any investor should be that highly volatile
    assets and times are not good times to be long.'

    However, the risk-return theory underlying the CAPM, and its spawn the Arbitrage
    Pricing Theory or the Stochastic Discount Theory, is not just totally vacuous,
    it seems to usually have a sign error! It is not correct as an approximation.
    In contrast, Black-Scholes gives decent Greeks given an implied volatility, and
    consistent with the efficient markets hypothesis, it is hard to outperform passive
    indices.

    sense to these savants is that that there's some risk factor that is like the
    stock market but actually inversely correlated with it (and thus, positively correlated
    with the relative returns of low-volatility equities and commodities). It must
    be subtle enough to escape notice of thousands of research academics for 50 years,
    and powerful enough to affect equities and commodities cross-sectionally. The
    thought that such a solution is possible highlights you simply can't falsify a
    framework like modern asset pricing theory. Further, there's so much strained
    hope in this view of the world that it puts delusional lottery ticket buyers to
    shame.
