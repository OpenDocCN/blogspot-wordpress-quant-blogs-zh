    returns in general. Looking at he 1992-2011 period, the commodity futures with
    low volatility outperformed those with high volatility by 4.6%. The effects appears
    independent of momentum and contango/backwardization effects.

    highly volatile assets have low, often negative returns, they have such high volatility
    they should simply be shunned: a 0.1 Sharpe strategy is a bad long AND short.
    Nonetheless, a good prejudice for any investor should be that highly volatile
    assets and times are not good times to be long.'

    However, the risk-return theory underlying the CAPM, and its spawn the Arbitrage
    Pricing Theory or the Stochastic Discount Theory, is not just totally vacuous,
    it seems to usually have a sign error! It is not correct as an approximation.
    In contrast, Black-Scholes gives decent Greeks given an implied volatility, and
    consistent with the efficient markets hypothesis, it is hard to outperform passive
    indices.

    sense to these savants is that that there's some risk factor that is like the
    stock market but actually inversely correlated with it (and thus, positively correlated
    with the relative returns of low-volatility equities and commodities). It must
    be subtle enough to escape notice of thousands of research academics for 50 years,
    and powerful enough to affect equities and commodities cross-sectionally. The
    thought that such a solution is possible highlights you simply can't falsify a
    framework like modern asset pricing theory. Further, there's so much strained
    hope in this view of the world that it puts delusional lottery ticket buyers to
    shame.

  zh: 这就是说，由于风险必须解释持久的回报，对这些专家来说，唯一合理的理论是存在一些类似股票市场但实际上与之反向相关（因此与低波动性股票和大宗商品的相对回报正相关）的风险因素。
    这种因素必须足够微妙，以至于在50年间逃避了成千上万的研究学者的注意，并且足够强大，能够横向影响股票和商品。 这样的解决方案的可能性，说明了现代资产定价理论这样的框架根本无法被证伪。
    此外，对世界的这种观点充满了如此紧张的希望，以至于会让有幻想购买彩票的人感到羞愧。
