# Talking with Tech Leads | Tales from a Trading Desk

> 来源：[https://mdavey.wordpress.com/2015/06/20/talking-with-tech-leads/#0001-01-01](https://mdavey.wordpress.com/2015/06/20/talking-with-tech-leads/#0001-01-01)

## Talking with Tech Leads

Many people struggle when they move into a tech lead role.  Primarily because there isn’t a well defined reference guide in most organisation as to what a tech lead is.  This book offers some insight by stating the obvious, and interviewing numerous tech leads.

*   Page 17 – “Learning better time-management and task-management techniques as well as delegation skills will help you to cope.”  Classic management foundations.  Although obvious, it needs to be re-iterated and remembered.
*   Page 178 – Failure is a natural part of the learning process; it forces you to evaluate circumstances.
*   Page 240 – “Lessons Learned by First-Time Tech Leads”
*   Page 242 – “Lessons Learned by Practising Tech Leads”

If you do nothing with this book, read page 240 and 242 as the bare minimum.

> Remaining technically grounded
