    stocks were down substantially on fears of a government shutdown. So when the
    government shut down, what happened? The market rallied. On Wednesday, the market
    re-considered its decision to rally on Tuesdsay. Futures were deeply in the red
    in the pre-open and the SPX was down over 10 points at the open, but rallied to
    close at the highs of the day. Such strength in the face of negative news has
    to viewed bullishly. In addition the chart below shows that the 50-day moving
    average has acted as technical support, which the index has not breached.

    beta small cap Russell 2000 Index, which has been the leadership in the latest
    advance. The Russell 2000 has staged multiple upside breakouts in this environment
    and remains in an uptrend.

    dynamics of the stock market. The bears just don't have the strength to push stocks
    lower despite the news backdrop. I can only conclude that the bulls remain in
    tactical control of the tape. Until fundamentals show signs of deterioration,
    my inner trader's inclination is to stay long this market.
