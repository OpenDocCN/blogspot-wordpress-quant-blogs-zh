    CTP build of Vista is coming anytime soon I‚Äôve decided to blog some of my experiences
    with build 5308 on the [Compaq](http://weblogs.asp.net/mdavey/archive/2005/07/28/420924.aspx)
    portable I have.

    support), hopefully the May 25, 2006 CTP will improve this.

    ‚Äì in certain circumstances there isn‚Äôt the ‚ÄúDetails‚Äù option to see what EXE is
    being run. Its also a shame there is no way of saying that an EXE is safe to run
    in the future instances ‚Äì assuming the EXE could be guaranteed to be the same
    binary (signed in some way) otherwise this dialog is going to become annoying
    (Redhat has such a feature I seem to remember) ‚Äì or am I missing this option?

    by default, would have preferred outbound connections to have been blocked as
    well in a similar fashion to [ZoneAlarm](http://www.zonelabs.com) ‚Äì maybe with
    a nice sidebar gadget to show which ports/processes were in use.
