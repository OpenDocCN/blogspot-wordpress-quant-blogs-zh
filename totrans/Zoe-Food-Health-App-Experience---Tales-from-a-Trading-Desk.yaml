    An expense that after a number of days, felt like Zeo had concentrated on the
    wrong parts of the overall Customer User Experience.

    Zoe support can’t do a lot to correct the order, impacting the overall User Experience
    within the app, and causing frustration

    and resume. Just discard and start again – challenging

    time reading about nutrition, you maybe best to start with Libre app and then
    consider if Zoe is worth the $
