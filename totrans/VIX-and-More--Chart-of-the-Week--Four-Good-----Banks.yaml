    [chart of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week),
    but until further notice, the banks are *the* story and it is inviting trouble
    to look past this fact for any period of time.

    Bank of America ([BAC](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/BAC)), Wells
    Fargo ([WFC](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/WFC)) and US Bancorp
    ([USB](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/USB)) were being held up as
    examples of four large relatively strong banks that were likely to emerge from
    the current financial crisis as the dominant large American banks.

- en: At this stage of the game, it appears as if Bank of America is clearly in trouble,
    Wells Fargo is coming under increased scrutiny, and even stalwarts JPMorgan Chase
    and US Bancorp are seeing confidence and share prices eroding rapidly. Dividend
    cuts and insider purchases have done little to stem the tide of value destruction
    and comments by the Obama administration to the effect that they are strongly
    in favor of private ownership of the banks have provided no more than a temporary
    reprieve.

    period. During that period, JPMorgan Chase has been the top performer in the group,
    losing 2/3 of its value, while losses at Wells Fargo and US Bancorp are now over
    75%. Bank of America is down over 90% during the same period.

    has just compiled a list of the [World’s 50 Safest Banks](http://www.gfmag.com/admin/mods/abmRepository/root/Docs/2009/safest_mid_year.pdf).
    The top U.S. bank on the list is Wells Fargo at #21\. US Bancorp is #26, JPMorgan
    Chase is #47 and the only other U.S. bank on the list is The Bank of New York
    Mellon ([BK](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/BK)), which comes in
    at #35.'
