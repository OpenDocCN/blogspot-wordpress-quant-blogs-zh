- en: Another big day down today and still the VIX isn’t stretched. An observation
    I’ve seen several traders make is that while the S&P fell hard last week, the
    VIX (and VXO) didn’t rise. The interpretation by some is that this suggests a
    lack of fear and is short-term bearish. I was unable to find evidence to support
    this theory. Below is one test I ran that looked at other times the S&P fell at
    least 2.5% while the VXO also fell.

    I would suggest that perhaps the VIX is simply an indicator lacking a solid edge
    for the time being.
