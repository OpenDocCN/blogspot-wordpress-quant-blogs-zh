- en: Our focus today though is whether China stocks qualify as potential opportunities
    following their recent correction. It’s our view that these stocks do offer attractive
    prospective returns. Not outstanding, but attractive. In other words, long-term
    investors should consider accumulating them at current levels.

- en: Yes, China’s economy is deteriorating. I’ve been consistently negative on this
    economy over the past 18 months. But the argument here is that a credit bust is
    now largely factored into stock prices. The Chinese stock market is down two-thirds
    from 2007 highs, investor sentiment is at multi-year lows, valuations are close
    to decade lows and bank prices have more than discounted a crisis.

    end with sharp falls and that may be ahead of us. Events such as further trust
    loan defaults and a serious property downturn (the next domino to fall) could
    further dent investor confidence. And the list goes on. Ultimately, however, these
    risks need to be weighed against the price on offer. In the case of Chinese stocks,
    the price appears reasonable.

    That is, stocks in sectors which should benefit from the country’s switch to a
    more consumption-driven economy.

    tailwinds. China’s internet penetration rate stands at just 40%, about the level
    of the US in 2000\. Only 25% of households have a personal computer, indicating
    ample room for growth. Lastly, the smartphone installed base, currently at close
    to 300 million, is expected to hit 400 million in 2014...

    retailers aren’t. While the latter faces considerable short-term headwinds, some
    are priced for it. I like Giordano, a pan-Asian discount retailer with significant
    exposure to China. It has a great track record and sports a single digit price-to-earnings
    ratio and sustainable dividend yield of +7%.

    benefit as incomes improve. PICC has a stronghold on property and casualty insurance
    and is reasonably priced.

- en: Though I am somewhat skeptical of any company in the financial sector because
    of looming credit, this investment thesis brings up an idea of a pairs trade.
    How about buying "New China" (consumer sectors) and shorting "Old China" (finance
    and infrastructure)?

    a relative breakout against FXI last summer and it has been on a tear ever since.
    While it is somewhat extended, this is one way to benefit from the stated government
    objective of rebalancing growth from credit driven infrastructure growth to consumer-led
    growth.

    not without risk. However, it may be an interesting way of being exposed to China;s
    growth with reduced market risk.
