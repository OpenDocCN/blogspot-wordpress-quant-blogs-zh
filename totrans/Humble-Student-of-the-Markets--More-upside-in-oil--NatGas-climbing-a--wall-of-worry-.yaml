    to be at a bullish extreme indicating that there may be more upside in black gold.
    However, oil does seem to be extended relative to other commodities.

    upside potential than oil prices and could hold up better should the energy complex
    correct. The chart below shows the price ratio of natural gas to crude oil, along
    with its long-term average and the one standard deviation bands around the average.
    I highlighted the price divergence between these two commodities in

    15% today, based on the conservative target of reaching the lower one standard
    deviation band. If we assumed that the ratio moved up to its long term average,
    the position would have a profit potential of 50%.

- en: Another way to look at oil is to look at its performance against gold. The chart
    below shows the price ratio of gold to oil since 2000\. Gold prices topped out
    against oil prices in late December 2007 and the ratio reversed itself dramatically.
    Oil now appears quite extended relative to gold, as it does against natural gas.

    are relatively neutral. As a result, I would prefer a long natural gas/short oil
    trade rather than a long gold/short oil trade.
