    the only reason investors would accept this is if they pay off in a very bad state
    of nature, just as you pay for car insurance. Specifically, everyone is suposedly
    afraid of a recession that would also bring with it deflation.

    negative lately. If you believed in the CAPM, that would mean the expected negative
    return makes sense, it is a negative 'risk premium'. Of course, the positive beta
    previously did not explain why bonds cratered from 1960 to 1980, and the CAPM
    does not work at all within equities, the arena it was designed for. It also does
    not work in corporate bonds, REITs, options, etc. But looked at in isolation it
    is a plausible explanation, and hope springs eternal.

    Reserve has been buying hundreds of billions of dollars in US Treasuries. Considering,
    they have an infinite supply of capital to do this (they create the money when
    they write the check), the market is not going to offset this via expectations
    of future inflation. So, the expectations are there, but US Treasuries are a rigged
    market, with one huge buyer debasing the world's most powerful currency because
    it's in the standard Keynesian manual for how to treat excess unemployment when
    inflation is currently low. Once the evidence of this short-sighted policy becomes
    clear, the inflation toothpaste will be out of the tube, and on to the next bubble-crash.

    bubble. Just look at gold to see what an inflation sensitive market looks like
    without Fed shenanigans. US Treasuries are not insurance any more than tech stocks
    were insurance in 1999.
