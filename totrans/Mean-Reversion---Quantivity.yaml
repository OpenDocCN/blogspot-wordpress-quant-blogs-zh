- en: Mean reversion is one of the most generic phenomena, manifesting in myriad beautiful
    ways across diverse subjects. For example, [Ornstein–Uhlenbeck processes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornstein%E2%8%93Uhlenbeck_process)
    are continuous-time stochastic processes for modeling mean-reversion. [Cointegration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cointegration)
    from time-series econometrics is a stationarity property of linear combinations
    of series. The Bollinger Bands is a technical indicator formed by bracketed upper
    and lower bounds based upon [standard deviation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation).
    Mean reversion also forms the basis for entire trading disciplines such as [statistical
    arbitrage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_arbitrage) and [volatility
    arbitrage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_arbitrage).

    a classic statistical arbitrage trading strategy. For simplicity, consider closing
    prices of [SPY](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=SPY) and [PRF](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=PRF)
    during 2007 – 2008\. This relationship is potentially interesting, as both are
    large-cap indices; their difference lies in weighting: PRF is weighted by fundamentals,
    while SPY is weighted by market capitalization. Price graph over this period is:'

    a long-term relationship whose residual difference reverts to zero (subject to
    the offset captured by the -7.356 intercept value, which represents the capital
    cost per share of trading the position). From this knowledge of mean reversion,
    myriad trading strategies can be devised. For example, go long the SPY/PRF basket
    when the residual difference exceeds -2; conversely, go short the basket when
    the residual difference exceeds +1.'
