    subsequent corporate guidance are likely to give investors greater clarity on
    whether the economy is softening into a slowdown or undergoing a soft landing
    and recovery. The preliminary picture is a fragile recovery. Forward guidance
    for Q2 has improved from Q1\. Negative pre-announcements have fallen and positive
    ones have risen.

    recovery. This matters because stock prices are facing substantial valuation risk.
    The S&P 500 is trading at a forward P/E of 19.3, which is higher than its 5-year
    average of 18.6 and 10-year average of 17.4, along with an elevated 10-year Treasury
    yield when compared to its 10- and 20-year history. The asset allocation case
    for equities has changed from TINA (There Is No Alternative) when rates were near
    zero to TARA (There Are Reasonable Alternatives) today. Any earnings disappointment
    could see stocks face substantial downside risk.
