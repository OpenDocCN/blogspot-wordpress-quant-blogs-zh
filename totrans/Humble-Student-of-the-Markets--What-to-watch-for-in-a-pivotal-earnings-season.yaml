- en: The Q2 earnings reporting season could be a pivotal one. Earnings reports and
    subsequent corporate guidance are likely to give investors greater clarity on
    whether the economy is softening into a slowdown or undergoing a soft landing
    and recovery. The preliminary picture is a fragile recovery. Forward guidance
    for Q2 has improved from Q1\. Negative pre-announcements have fallen and positive
    ones have risen.

  zh: 第二季度财报公布季可能是关键的一季。财报公布和企业后续指导可能会让投资者对经济是否正在软着陆和复苏有更清晰的判断。初步的情况是一个脆弱的复苏。第二季度的前景指导比第一季度有所改善。负面预先通知的数量下降了，正面预先通知的数量上升了。
- en: The key question is whether this represents a data blip or the real signs of
    recovery. This matters because stock prices are facing substantial valuation risk.
    The S&P 500 is trading at a forward P/E of 19.3, which is higher than its 5-year
    average of 18.6 and 10-year average of 17.4, along with an elevated 10-year Treasury
    yield when compared to its 10- and 20-year history. The asset allocation case
    for equities has changed from TINA (There Is No Alternative) when rates were near
    zero to TARA (There Are Reasonable Alternatives) today. Any earnings disappointment
    could see stocks face substantial downside risk.

  zh: 关键问题是这是否代表数据异常还是复苏的真实迹象。这很重要，因为股价面临巨大的估值风险。标普500的远期市盈率为19.3，这高于其过去5年的平均值18.6和10年的平均值17.4，与此同时，与它的10年和20年历史相比，10年国债收益率也处于高位。在资产配置方面，对股市的看法已经从利率接近零时的TINA（没有其他选择）转变为今天的TARA（有合理的其他选择）。任何财报失望都可能导致股市面临巨大的下行风险。
