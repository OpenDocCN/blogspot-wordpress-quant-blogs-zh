    the European arm of [NYSE Euronext](http://www.nyse.com/), recently [announced](http://www.euronext.com/editorial/wide/editorial-8813-EN.html)
    the creation of three new volatility indices: the AEX Volatility Index; the BEL
    20 Volatility Index; and the CAC 40 Volatility Index. These indices will be calculated
    in the same manner as the current VIX methodology and will be launched on September
    3, 2007.'

    which is the incumbent volatility index of choice for the European markets and
    also a product of the [Deutsche Börse](http://deutsche-boerse.com/dbag/dispatch/de/kir/gdb_navigation/home).

    the <country-region st="on"><place st="on">US</place></country-region> and across
    the globe, with volatility in the headlines as of late, demand for these products
    growing rapidly, and the battle for supremacy among the major exchanges heating
    up at the same time. I wonder, though, given that we already have a volatility
    index for the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, do we gain anything significant by adding
    new ones for <city st="on">Amsterdam</city>, <city st="on">Brussels</city> and
    <city st="on"><place st="on">Paris</place></city> as well?
