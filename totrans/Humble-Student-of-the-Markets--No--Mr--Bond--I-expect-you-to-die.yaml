    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    signal. A bullish Trend Model signal that gets less bullish is a trading "sell"
    signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading
    "buy" signal. The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of
    the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. The turnover rate
    of the trading model is high, and it has varied between 150% to 200% per month.

    to escape their perceived risks. That's because the market may be focused on the
    wrong bond. The top panel of the following chart shows the yield 10-year Treasury
    note, which has violated a trend line that stretches back to 1990, and the yield
    of the 30-year Treasury, which has not.

    the 10-year yield. As experienced market analysts know, excess focus on a benchmark
