    to choppy over time. Today I am going to look at weekly bars. I will also have
    some further follow-up later this week which look at the statistics of some of
    the “Trend vs. Chop” results.

    The first test here buys on the close of any up bar and reverses to short at the
    close of any down bar. Like last week, the trades were at a constant $100,000
    per trade for the entire period. No commissions or slippage are figured in to
    the test. A rising graph would indicate follow through is dominant while a falling
    graph would indicate reversals are dominant. Sideways action would suggest no
    tendency.

    much of their history until fairly recently, the weekly timeframe has been more
    prone to chop since the early 70’s.

    downside follow-through. You’ll see a large difference here. The chart below looks
    at the results of shorting down weeks.

    to show persistent weakness. Since then, with the exception of a few short periods
    during bear markets, buying the dips has worked quite well.

    That is where you see the peak near the left hand side of the graph. Since that
    time the market has gone through cycles that sometimes favored buying strength
    and sometimes favored selling strength. Thirty-five years later the equity of
    the system is right back near its peak 1973 level. It should be no surprise that
    the current spike down began in 2007.

    time evaluating or developing swing-trading systems. When trying to take advantage
    of 3-5 day moves, it is generally easier to develop long-only strategies that
    perform relatively well over time than to produce short-only strategies that perform
    consistently well. Hence a big reason you see so many more long-only systems.
    Of course in 2008 so far shorting strength has been easier than buying weakness.
