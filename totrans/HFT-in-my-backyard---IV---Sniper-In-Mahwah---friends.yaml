    heard some people were “*jumpy*” because I put public data on a map, but others
    were quite friendly. I thank those who pointed out the mistakes I made. I am not
    a journalist, nor am I a whistleblower. I just wanted to *see* the EU microwave
    networks as I am trying to work on the “nature of market”, the topic of a Ph.
    D. for which I am trying to find a grant. French King François Hollande once said “*finance
    has no face”* (as the Ceres statue at the top of the CBOT in Chicago) but by mapping
    the microwave networks it’s possible to give high-frequency trading a face. A blog
    is not an academic space, and even if I am trying to be as accurate as I can (that’s
    not so easy, trust me), I’m trying to maintain a sense of humor.

    a full-time job), I had never thought to come across some stories that could be
    turned into a plot for a TV series on HBO or Netflix. The small world of HFT microwave
    networks is full of surprises. One of them is the only network I didn’t talk about
    until now: Latent Networks. Thanks to Latent I have learnt a lot about how nature
    (*i.e.* waves) is a tradable product for the high-frequency competitors. This
    episode was quite hard to write (I am on a grey line here) and the devil is in

    the website of the [Agence national des fréquences](http://www.anfr.fr/fr/anfr.html).
    With Cartoradio I started to map the towers in North of France. There was nothing
    special about Latent – they received a first [license](http://arcep.fr/uploads/tx_gsavis/13-0149.pdf) in
    France on February 5, 2013\. Since I had never heard about the network, I downloaded
    the official [list](http://www.arcep.fr/index.php?id=2102) with the contact details
    of all the radio companies active in France. All the HFT competitors are transparent
    in the sense they have a postal address and offices with people working there.
    The first intriguing thing about Latent is that the company is [incorporated](https://opencorporates.com/companies/mt/C57432) in
    the Republic of Malta, and I thought it was quite exotic to find a HFT network
    in a tax haven. I asked some people in the industry about Latent and answers were
    evasive (but I realized later that some knew more than they told me first, I think
    they were waiting to read my first posts before giving me more data).

    dollars you can buy the “certificate of registration”, where I thought I could

    In short: Latent Networks Limited was incorporated in Malta on September 4, 2012,

    am not paranoid at all, but given the Malta-Cyprus-Panama-Warszawa network, one
    may wonder why a high-frequency microwave network needs a worldwide SuperMontage.
    I thought such sophisticated configurations were made for drug cartels, mafias

    early 2012, the founders “*jumped into the microwave industry when they smelled
    money*”, according to a person who crossed their path. Around 2011-2012, in the
    US, a lot of people were trying to set up microwave networks by connecting the
    different market venues, the most important route being the New Jersey-Chicago one. Alex
    Pilosov’s Windy Apple Technologies network was the first to be achieved mid-2010; Marty
    Snyder’s Communication Infrastructure Corporation ([CIC](http://www.cicusa.com))
    was working on different routes too, along with other firms (check this interesting
    2012 [article](http://www.spreadnetworks.com/media/10531/arms_race_story_-_sep_12_a.pdf)).
    Newgig decided to come on board and appointed [Aviat Networks](http://www.aviatnetworks.com) in
    the US and [Nexxcom](http://www.nexxcomwireless.com) in EU to build two networks
    – New Jersey-Chicago, Frankfurt-London. But things went wrong mid-2012. The rest
    of the story can be found in the Superior Court of the State of California records

    and Nexxcom). On March 31, 2012, Newgig and Nexxcom ”*entered into a agreement involving
    the construction, implementation and activation of a wireless network between
    United Kingdom and Germany*“, according to Nexccom’s “Cross complaint for breach
    of contract” filed  at the Superior Court of California later this year. But around
    June 2012, Newgig failed to pay the first invoices sent by Nexxcom. Nexxcom “*is
    informed and believes that in July 2012, Newgig was financially overcommitted
    to other projects, including that Newgig was 100% over-budget*”. According to
    Nexxcom, at this time one of the two founders of Newgig admitted that they were
    “*100% over-budget, many months behind schedule and incurring penalties from customers
    that hey had pre-sold services*”; Newgig also admitted “*that the project was
    running into trouble as the route passed through Pennsylvania and New Jersey”*.

    27,000 tons, equivalent to four times the Tour Eiffel (!), which means that it’s

    126 rooms and a luxurious panoramic restaurant. But as far as I know the restaurant
    never existed, the rooms were transformed into apartments and the building quickly

    microwave networks working with *one* *microsecond* accuracy are installed in such
    a poor place. Last year, a few months after I paid a visit to NYSE-Euronext’s
    facility in Basildon (the most spectacular there is the emptiness), I had the
    chance visit to the Euronext control room in Paris, where dozens of very big screens
    show market activity. When I left the office I walked a few meters and I came
    across a phone booth where a young woman and two very very young near-naked children were
    sleeping. The contrast was striking between a very rich technological world and
    a very poor human world. I had the same feelings when I was [reading](http://www.proshareng.com/articles/2540/Is-the-Nigerian-Stock-Exchange-ready-for-high-frequency-Stock-Trading) discussions
    about the future role of high-frequency trading in the Nigerian market, Nigeria
    being one of the poorest countries in the world. In Tour du Reuze, sophisticated
    trading firms use wireless to silently send flow of orders at the speed of light
    above the head of people who barely have access to internet. We live in interesting
    times. That being said  the rents for the HFT dishes surrounding the panoramic
    space are not cheap, and that’s good news: that proves high-frequency trading
    may have a social benefit;)'

    is taking over the Latent frequencies can be confirmed by visiting the official
    UK radio regulator website. On the Ofcom website there is this [map](http://spectruminfo.ofcom.org.uk/spectrumInfo/licences) allowing
    you to find the radio operator licenses. But there is another space called “[Spectrum
    trading](http://spectruminfo.ofcom.org.uk/spectrumInfo/trades)”. Before high-frequency
    traders can use microwave networks to trade whatever-you-want, the network providers
    have to book and pay for frequency licenses. In the UK a license is granted for
    a path between two points/towers. This license is a tradable product in a sense
    that if a radio operator doesn’t need it anymore, the “Spectrum trading” space
    allow them to re-sell their licenses to who is willing to buy it. As a product
    of nature, waves are tradable – it’s the market after all.

    sold UK licenses to Getco, period. But I thought it was quite strange as there
    are two kinds of competitors in the HFT microwave world: trading firms like Optiver
    of Flow Traders, which build their own network for themselves, and providers like
    McKay Brothers or Custom Connect. These sell bandwidth to customers (trading firms,
    hedge funds, banks, etc.) but they *don’t re-sell* frequencies, paths or licenses
    to trading firms. The Latent case is therefore quite unusual: the network is not
    a provider selling bandwidth to customers, and it’s not a trading firm. I didn’t
    find public data showing that Latent sold UK licenses to other firms than Getco. Anyway,
    the fact the first licenses Getco acquired from Latent in March 2014 was those needed

    “Rules of the Game: Low Latency Microwave in a Multi-Regulatory Environment” is

    build the McKay Brothers LLC low latency network between Chicago and New York”
     *wrote Marshall,* “there were some technical testing challenges with which to
    deal. *[…]* As complex as that undertaking was, it turned out to be simple in
    comparison to the level of regulatory complexity we experienced when we went to
    Europe to construct a low latency network linking the continent’s leading financial
    hubs of London and Frankfurt*. […]*When building a trans-national low latency
    network, the regulatory bottlenecks will always occur on the border-crossing link.

    that some HFT competitors have asked for licenses without installing dishes just in
    order to “squat” frequencies and block competitors. In other words: you ask for
    a large number of frequencies so that your competitors can’t get them anymore
    – in this case, you can’t cross the channel, and if you can’t cross the channel,
    you are not able to build a network between Frankfurt and London. Simple to understand:
    trading firms need waves; without waves, the firms won’t be the fastests. That’s
    why there was a “*a large amount of speculation occurring”* around the channel. Mr.
    Marshall’s statement is consistent with the “*rumors”* about “*frequency squatting
    or tower squatting”* mentioned by [Bloomberg](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-07-15/wall-street-grabs-nato-towers-in-traders-speed-of-light-quest.html).
    But there, around the North Sea, rumors were facts. I know for sure that (at least) two
    competitors have experienced real difficulties to get frequencies to cross the
    channel, because of the frequency squatting or speculation. One was a microwave
    network provider; the other one was a proprietary trading firm. So I wondered:
    who were the squatters? Who tried to speculate on the waves? A few days later
    an answer popped-up in my mailbox. And it was juststaggering.'

    small world with the help of people from the industry who kindly and fairly talked
    to me. One of these networks was quite unusual so I decided to dig more, but I
    would have never imagined I would receive a mail accusing a firm incorporated
    in Malta-Cyprus-Panama to speculate on the North Sea waves. As anyone familiar
    with the HFT world I knew the stories about some employees accused to have stolen
    trading codes from a firm to take them away (the Sergey Aleynikov case being the most well-known),

    the Trade Tech organizers allowed me to attend the entire conference *if and only
    if* I would give a talk (I couldn‘t afford to pay the requested €3,000). The day
    after, while discovering the different booths, a manager from the Dutch regulator [AFM](http://www.afm.nl/en) came
    to me and had very kind words about my rubbish talk (we discussed about finance,
    Michel Foucault and the Panopticon), and a French physicist told me about his
    view on Nietzsche and Toynbee. But the first person I talked with that day was
    an appealing man wearing elegant glasses. We gently talked about epistemology
    and he told me about his job. The appealing man with a Polish name, whom I never
    met again, was working for a firm providing technical supports to the HFT microwave networks. I
    don’t remember the pin, but the man was the kangaroo.
