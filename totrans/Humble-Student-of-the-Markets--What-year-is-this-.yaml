    to see a repeat of 1929\. We are just experiencing a deep and nasty recession.
    The world will emerge out of this downturn sometime next year and investors should
    be positioned in anticipation of a recovery.

    for parallels from their own experience. This is problematical in this current
    bear market. For a portfolio manager with ten years of working life, his bear
    market experience consists of the post-NASDAQ bubble crash. Twenty years gets
    you the post-NASDAQ bubble and the bear market of 1990\. Both of those occasions
    involved fairly mild recessions.

    bear of 1982\. I apprenticed mostly under people who lived through the recession
    and bear of 1974\. Those were inventory recessions, caused by the central bank
    putting on the brakes on an overheated economy. Those recessions, while deeper
    than the downturns of 1990 and 2000-2, were not good parallels to today.

    and their collapse in 1968, as well as some of the markets in the 1950s. Even
    those markets were not good parallels to this current period of macroeconomic

    and stop at the US border. I can remember a lot of silly analysis that went on
    after 9/11\. Analysts cited the market’s reaction after Pearl Harbor as to the
    probable market reaction after the start of a war. Did World War II start in December
    1941? It did for America, but was that true for the rest of the world, or more
    importantly, Mr. Market? Ask the Europeans. Did the German blitzkrieg invasion
    of Poland in 1939 mean nothing? What about the fall of France in 1940? Did Mr.
    Market think that Operation Barbarossa, the massive German invasion of the Soviet
    Union in the summer of 1941, mean that the war was “well-contained” like the sub-prime
    crisis? Meanwhile over in Asia, the Japanese occupation of Manchuria began in
    1931 and well pre-dated the German invasion of Poland. Was that just a historical
    blip?

    the depressions seen in the 19th Century, which caused a great deal of concern
