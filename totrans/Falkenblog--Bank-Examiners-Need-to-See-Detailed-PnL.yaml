    It would be great if every major corporation had the courage to generate this
    kind of informative mea culpa, and suggests there is little cognitive dissonance
    of this error. The report highlights several key issues that have applicability
    beyond the scope of the current subprime debacle, to a more general information
    systems issue.

    able to evaluate the business lines of a bank the way banks do, or should, look
    at their business lines. That is, large financial companies are composites of
    perhaps a hundred of lower line businesses, defined by a combination of currency,
    industry, instrument type, etc. The problem is, outsiders merely see top-line
    numbers for revenues and expenses, sometimes going down to lines like ‘trading’,
    ‘investment banking’, and ‘asset management’, still an incredibly high level of
    aggregation. Even Regulators and rating agency representatives are given very
    high, and selective, data. When a disaster hits it exposes a particular activity
    that was perhaps not given much thought: who knew UBS had $50 billion in US residential
    mortgages on their balance sheet?'

- en: The problem is that the most common information given out by banks is insufficient
    to see what is really going on. Assets, for example, are merely broken into large
    groupings based on Agency rating, maturity, and for non-rated assets whether they
    are performing or not. This is like assessing the health of someone by looking
    at their current body temperature and weight. VaR is applied selectively in a
    bank, leading to issues of adverse selection and moral hazard, as selective risky
    assets are rationalized as being on the ‘banking book’ instead of the ‘trading
    book’, so that the final top-down number excludes the majority of actual risk,
    and a biased majority at that. Another problem is that credit risk is still very
    difficult to measure in the VaR framework, so that given the particular collateral,
    obligor, and facility, can have a very different risk profile depending on details
    that banks are not obligated to supply, let alone validate. When you try to find
    comparables, you are acting more like a historian than a quant, and so you should
    expect these measures to be off by a factor of 2\.

    not mentioned in risk management literature. First, profitability reporting was
    just as important as risk measures--for measuring risk! This is because you could
    pair the income generated with your bottom up risk measure, and see if it was
    reasonable. Often, your risk measure was off by a factor of 3 because you forgot
    certain assets had guarantees, or had off-balance sheet exposures. Most of these
    errors weren’t subtle, they merely omitted a significant factor. Most complex
    problems, like examining the risk of a large financial institution, are not really
    fundamentally complex, merely detailed, and so getting good approximations was
    more a function of asking for the right set of details, rather than working out
    the mathematics of a complex non-recombining lattice. Secondly, the aggregate
    numbers were pretty irrelevant. The bottom-up, aggregate required capital estimate
    was so dependent on uncertain assumptions about correlations, and the relation
    between our franchise value versus the value of assets on and off our balance
    sheet, that it was rightfully ignored.

    revenue. While we should work to make these risk measures better, in the meantime,
    looking at metrics based partially on revenues is very informative. Indeed, the
    average annualized volatility for the major 7 money center banks in the US had
    annualized 99% VaRs of about $1.8B in 2007, but still managed to lose an average
    of $42B in market value over the past 12 months. This suggests that, as a top-down
    number, reported VaR is about as useful as knowing the CEO’s favorite color.

- en: The main problem in UBS's business model was that the senior RMBS were funded
    improperly, because if these securities were seen as having negative carry they
    would have been evaluated all their mortgages more stringently. UBS applied the
    bank funding rate to all their activities, and so Aaa rated mortgage paper had
    a positive carry. There was an internal arb in the bank, in that almost any paper
    funded at such rates generates positive carry, and given the infrequent (but massive)
    nature of credit losses, in combination with bonuses based on annual revenues,
    created an incentive to put these assets on the books.

    operational risk, as incentives led to an inefficient allocation of resources
    that ended with a disaster.

- en: If every bank showed its profitability reporting by line of business, an analyst
    would be able to flag these issues much better. That is, say there was a business
    group in charge of the RMBS on the bank’s balance sheet. Taking into account the
    capital applied to this business, and its funding rate, what was its NIACC? What
    was its ROE? If the bank reported that the NIACC, or Sharpe ratio, was significantly
    positive, one could note the asset class in question, and deduce something fishy
    that necessitated further inquiry. This is because such a large asset class simply
    does not have a large Sharpe ratio, and one could easily note this because no
    hedge funds warehouse large amounts of high-rated ABS. An assumption in the business
    model is clearly wrong, and given the amount of residential mortgages on the balance
    sheet, this error is significant.

- en: One should expect financial institutions to have modest Sharpe ratios for the
    income generated by assets sitting on their balance sheets, because merely holding
    a common asset class simply does not have a Sharpe much above 0.25\. The average
    Sharpe ratio of the stock market is about 0.4, and this is the ‘equity premium
    puzzle’, because it is so high. Thus, we should expect very few assets to be above
    this number, and if so, assumptions need to be examined.

    business advantage, so it may be necessary to allow this informational reporting
    only for rating agencies and regulators, who sign nondisclosure agreements. The
    key is that specific net revenue, and capital allocation figures can lead to better
    questions by those outsiders like investors, and taxpayers, rely on to monitor
    these opaque institutions. Linking revenues to risk allows you to understand the
    bottom level risk numbers better, and find the landmines before they blow up.

- en: 'At UBS, much of the growth in the Fixed Income group came from repackaging
    residential mortgages from the US into mezzanine (e.g., Ba rated) CDOs and reselling
    them. This generated fees of 125 to 150 basis points, compared to fees of only
    40 basis points on senior tranches. But the 150 basis points on the mezzanine
    piece necessitated keeping 60% of the RMBS on their books, the senior pieces.
    These assets supported great trading revenue, but if there were properly funded
    and assessed the appropriate capital, it would have been obvious that while 150
    basis points is great business, the costs generated by warehousing the supporting
    collateral put a limit on how much of this stuff was optimal. Instead, the residual
    assets warehoused seemed to have a positive NIACC (equal to an above-hurdle rate
    Sharpe), and thus at the margin added to the bank’s value, so there was effectively
    no limit to how much was optimal: as many as their mezzanine CDO group could sell.
    But no matter whether these senior piece were put in a separate business line,
    or kept within the group generating the restructuring fees, it would have set
    off red flags that a liquid and large asset class like RMBS was capable of generating
    significant alpha. Like taking 50 basis points out of a Treasury Bill trade, some
    familiarity with the spreads and returns of these assets suggests that some large
    tail risk is being assumed, because there just isn’t enough spread to generate
    this kind of profit without some error in transfer pricing or risk estimation.'

- en: Clearly, they rationalized the positive carry on super senior RMBS via the fat
    fees on the CDOs, but this had deleterious spill-over effects as well. UBS put
    on tens of billions of Aaa-rated ABS for things like autos and credit cards based
    on the same, flawed, funding model. After all, one could say, if you are going
    to fund Aaa RMBS at positive carry, why not Aaa auto loans? And so, when credit
    spreads for all structured finance widened, UBS took a considerable hit there
    as well, losing about $4B, all in an investment that never made sense to begin
    with. The origin of this loss was operational risk at its core.

- en: The conventional corporate bond puzzle is that Investment Grade spreads are
    too high.[1] The most conspicuous bond index captures US Baa and Aaa bond yields
    going back to 1919, which generates enough data to make it ‘the’ corporate spread
    measure, especially when looking at correlations with business cycles. Yet Baa
    bonds are still ‘investment grade’, and have only a 4.7% 10 year cumulative default
    rate after initial rating. As the recovery rate on defaulted bonds is around 50%,
    this annualizes to a mere 0.23% annualized loss rate. Since the spread between
    Baa and Aaa bonds has averaged around 1.2% since 1919, this generates an approximate
    0.97% annualized excess return compared to the riskless Aaa yield, creating the
    puzzle that spreads are ‘too high’ for the risk incurred.

- en: Though a puzzle, it would be a mistake for Aaa rated companies to actually assume
    this spread is investment alpha. The other two such return anomalies, the short
    end of the yield curve, and the equity premium [2], clearly do not imply one should
    take yield curve risk, or borrow to invest in equities. Public companies are not
    necessary for taking these bets, and so an inefficient way to address them even
    if an investor thought the represented merely ‘behavioral biases’. We may not
    fully understand these particular risk premiums, but they are not ‘arbitrage’.
    Banks would be wise to fund at best the A rate internally, to avoid this kind
    of gaming. When the UBS funded AAA rated assets at a positive carry, this error
    was essential for supporting the wrong track they went down.

- en: A well-run bank should have income tied to a capital allocation based on economic
    risk, at the business line level. Thus it should be able to provide this information.
    An examiner would then see the various Sharpes, for the various business lines,
    and their assets on the balance sheet, and see if these make sense. A very high
    Sharpe invites investigation. Was it funded correctly? Are there off-balance sheet
    liabilities? Is the VaR, or capital allocation, correct? By having this on a specific
    asset class, such as super senior residential mortgages, or fixed-receive swaps
    in the Treasury account, the analyst can address the issue. With a top-down VaR,
    one has no way of asking relevant questions about how the VaR was estimated, but
    rather general questions about VaR methodology that are not likely to be informative.

- en: 'If a bank is putting on a large amount of assets onto their balance sheet,
    or retaining exposure to off-balance sheet liabilities, there are two general
    paths to detect this: from a bottom up risk calculation, and through a top-down
    revenue examination. Most bank businesses are not amenable to a reasonably precise
    economic capital estimation based merely on the asset’s characteristics, and economic
    capital algorithms are applied inconsistently in the current framework. Thus,
    the revenues from these businesses add important information because in general
    we have good intuition on what reasonable risk-adjusted rates of return are, especially
    for prosaic asset classes like residential mortgages. A financial institution
    making exorbitant returns on these things implies some assumption within the bank
    is incorrect. Only through the obscurity of aggregation were these positions allowed
    to fester into the problems they became, and so at least regulators, but perhaps
    rating agency representatives, should be able to demand data on the profits, regulatory,
    and economic capital, at the lowest level line of business. If they say ''we manage
    at the ''asset management'' level'', allow the examiners to discuss in detail
    what they found. As shareholders learn of this, they will realize they are heading
    towards disaster, because you can''t manage a bank at that level, so it''s either
    reflects ignorance or mendacity.'
