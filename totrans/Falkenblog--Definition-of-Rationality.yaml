    was really dumb, like making a bad investment. A good definition of rationality

    the decision maker is confronted with an analysis of the decisions involved, but
    with no additional information, she does not regret her choices.

    but no new or different assumptions. Thus, you could show someone not following
    Bayes's rule they are wrong in real time if all they understood was logic, which
    is independent of empirical data. People who think 'shy librarians' are more common
    than 'librarians' are thinking irrationally, whereas people who think tax cuts
    are good/bad for the economy are rational as long as they understand how their
    assumptions relate to their conclusion.

    and people realize that anchoring, framing, and representativeness biases are
    'wrong', and thus change their opinions upon learning about their errors.

    rational, because they don't understand logic, their instincts simply dominate
    in certain cases. But that's not most people, so if an educated group of adults
    believes something, and defends their beliefs vigorously, it's rational even if
    it's wrong.

    academic conferences that basically all agreed Alicia Munell was right and Stan
    Liebowitz was wrong, so smart people all agreed that the historical data showed
    trivial mortgage risk from such changes (See
