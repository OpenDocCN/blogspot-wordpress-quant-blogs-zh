    from Accrued on the quote conventions for USD bond prices. Accrued notes Bloomberg’s
    importance in this area, so I’ll add some further info based on quoting conventions
    for govt bonds on Bloomberg single dealer pages…'

- en: 'Bid and ask prices: all dealers quote two prices, the price they’ll buy at
    – the bid – and the price they’ll sell at, the ask or offer. The spread is the
    difference between bid and ask. Bloomberg has a feature called ALLQ that will
    let a user see a stack of dealer quotes ranked by tightness of spread. Some have
    argued that other factors ought to influence the ALLQ ranking, for instance dealer
    execution rates. But that’s a question for another day.'

    interest accrued between coupon payments. Trades are settled as dirty prices,
    so the seller is compensated for the portion of the next coupon payment he’ll

    One ASM measure is 6M yield/yield – the spread between the bond yield and the
    matching point on the 6M swap curve.'

    BEI is the inflation level that will cause a linker to pay the same coupon as
