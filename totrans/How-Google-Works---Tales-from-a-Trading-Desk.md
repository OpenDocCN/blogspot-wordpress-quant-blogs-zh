## How Google Works

Recently just finished reading [How Google Works](http://www.howgoogleworks.net/).  Like so many book, the start of the book is better than the end in my view.  However, I still think its a great book, providing some good insight into practices used by Google that can be leverage elsewhere:

*   Page 28 offers a view on how how the Google culture works in solving problems – in this particular scenario, the result offending ads.  Culture
*   Page 30.  Culture.  Decision by committee vs autocratic or combative approaches.
*   Page 42\. Rule of seven.
*   Page 45\. Reorg day – get it done fast
*   Page 48\. Exile knave but fight for divas
*   Page 64\. Don’t be evil.
*   Page 97.  Hierarchical hiring doesn’t work.
*   Page 115.  Some good commentary around interviewing
*   Page 123.  The hiring pack – all to often I have seen committee’s make hiring decisions on lack of data
*   Page 125\. Reward outstanding people
*   Page 127\. Trade the M&M’s, keep the raisins
*   Page 132.  Google’s Hiring Dos and Don’ts
*   Page 139.  Know your elevator pitch
*   Page 156\. Do something, even if its wrong
*   Page 163\. Running meetings well – some good rules.  Unfortunate, many forget about meeting etiquette  😦
*   Page 170\. Get a coach, not a power point training deck!
*   Page 179\. Snippets – weekly status reports
*   Page 189\. Email wisdom: respond quickly. clean inbox, Crisp delivery
*   Page 192\. 1:1s – performance on job requirements, relationship to peer groups, management/leadership, innovation
