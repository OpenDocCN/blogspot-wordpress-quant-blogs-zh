- en: 'A lot of research has been written on combining mean-reversion with trend filters,
    but surprisingly little if no recent research has focused on the opposite approach:
     attempting to follow the trend with less whiplash. What does that mean? Well
    anyone who has had the experience of trying to follow a trend typically has to
    endure the pain of buying their position and having to soon after exit the position
    at a lower price. Trend followers also experience being profitable for long periods
    of time, only to have the position suddenly and violently reverse and hand them
    a tidy loss.  Ironically one of the funny things that happens after such an event
    is that the market often bounces considerably higher in the short-term. The obvious
    solution to these problems is to create a counter-trend  delayed entry and exit
    using short-term mean-reversion indicators. However what is missing from this
    proposed solution is a generalized framework for determining how and when to use
    such methods. More on this to follow……….'
