- en: While the VIX gets most of the media attention as a [fear](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/fear)
    indicator, its usefulness is clearly much better for volatility related to U.S.
    equities than it is for other asset classes and economic threats.

  zh: 虽然VIX作为**恐慌**指标吸引了大部分媒体的注意力，但它在反映与美国股市相关的波动方面的作用明显比其他资产类别和经济威胁要好。
- en: The [TED spread](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TED%20spread) received
    considerable acclaim in 2008 as measure of liquidity and a reasonable proxy for
    [counterparty risk](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/counterparty%20risk).
    Of course [gold](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/gold) had been around
    the longest of all and has served as a barometer of risk for all types of investments
    and other risks for centuries.

  zh: '[TED利差](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TED%20spread)在2008年受到了广泛的赞誉，作为流动性的衡量标准，是一个合理的**对手方风险**的替代品。当然，**黄金**是最早出现的，几个世纪以来，它一直作为各种投资和其他风险的晴雨表。'
- en: In the chart below, I have overlain the VIX, TED spread and gold against a backdrop
    of a declining SPX for the past year. Note that the TED spread peaks first among
    the three, during the second week in October, and subsides rather quickly, as
    liquidity issues recede to the background. The VIX is next to peak, but it too
    begins to head down toward the end of November as fears of systemic meltdown slowly
    begin to subside.

  zh: 在下面的图表中，我将VIX、TED利差和黄金与过去一年SPX下跌的背景进行了叠加。注意，在这三者中，TED利差最早达到峰值，是在十月的第二周，随后很快下降，随着流动性问题的缓解而退居次要地位。VIX是下一个达到峰值的，但到了十一月底也开始下降，因为系统性崩溃的恐慌开始慢慢消退。
- en: The most interesting line on the chart is that price of gold, which actually
    bottomed in mid-November and has risen sharply over the past three months, partly
    as a safe haven for panicky investors, but also as a hedge against the risk of
    inflation due to various fiscal policy approaches that governments are taking
    in order to rejuvenate the economy.

  zh: 图表上最有趣的一条线是黄金的价格，实际上在十一月中旬触底，并在过去三个月里急剧上升，部分原因是恐慌投资者的避风港，但也作为对政府为恢复经济而采取的各种财政政策方法所引发通胀风险的避险。
- en: In summary, the TED spread has retraced its entire September-October spike,
    the VIX has retraced about half of its September-November spike, and gold appears
    to have paused after retracing about 20% of its November-February move. The TED
    spread and the VIX look like old news at the moment, with the possibility that
    gold may be the best fear indicator for current market conditions.

  zh: 总之，TED利差已经回吐了九月至十月的全部涨幅，VIX回吐了九月至十一月的涨幅的一半，而黄金在回吐了十一月至二月的20%涨幅后似乎暂停了。目前来看，TED利差和VIX似乎是旧消息，而黄金可能是当前市场条件下最好的恐慌指标。
