    indicator, its usefulness is clearly much better for volatility related to U.S.
    equities than it is for other asset classes and economic threats.

- en: The [TED spread](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TED%20spread) received
    considerable acclaim in 2008 as measure of liquidity and a reasonable proxy for
    [counterparty risk](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/counterparty%20risk).
    Of course [gold](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/gold) had been around
    the longest of all and has served as a barometer of risk for all types of investments
    and other risks for centuries.

- en: In the chart below, I have overlain the VIX, TED spread and gold against a backdrop
    of a declining SPX for the past year. Note that the TED spread peaks first among
    the three, during the second week in October, and subsides rather quickly, as
    liquidity issues recede to the background. The VIX is next to peak, but it too
    begins to head down toward the end of November as fears of systemic meltdown slowly
    begin to subside.

- en: The most interesting line on the chart is that price of gold, which actually
    bottomed in mid-November and has risen sharply over the past three months, partly
    as a safe haven for panicky investors, but also as a hedge against the risk of
    inflation due to various fiscal policy approaches that governments are taking
    in order to rejuvenate the economy.

    the VIX has retraced about half of its September-November spike, and gold appears
    to have paused after retracing about 20% of its November-February move. The TED
    spread and the VIX look like old news at the moment, with the possibility that
    gold may be the best fear indicator for current market conditions.
