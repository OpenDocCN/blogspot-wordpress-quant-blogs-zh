    is not on par with what [BA](http://www.britishairways.com/) provides.¬† I can‚Äôt
    see my current flight details, or my up and coming flights, and forget about electronic
    boarding cards.¬† With regards to quality of services, I think BA and Virgin Atlantic
    could learn a lot from [Etihad](http://www.etihad.com) and [Emirates](http://www.emirates.com).

    kindly tell you that you can watch the films immediately as long as you ONLY use
    the Virgin Atlantic headsets.¬† Problem is that they only hand out the headsets
    once they have taken off ‚Äì total madness üò¶
