    interview with Paul Volcker who said that he felt so much under the microscope
    that when he went out to a restaurant, he felt compelled to say, "I'll have the
    steak, but that doesn't mean that I don't like the chicken or the lobster."

    stock and bond markets sold off. While the major equity averages rallied the next
    day to recover virtually all of their losses, the Treasury market remained mired
    in the red compared to pre-FOMC announcement levels as of the close on Thursday.

    Most of the analysis that I've read had a neutral or slightly dovish take to the
    FOMC statement and Yellen press conference. Here are some examples.

    Markets seem to have ignored the caveats. That is the danger of being too explicit
    when specificity isn’t called for. Bernanke made a similar mistake last summer
    in saying that “when asset purchases ultimately come to an end, the unemployment
    rate would likely be in the vicinity of 7 per cent” — only to walk it back shortly
    after. Don’t be surprised if Yellen also clarifies further what she meant by the
    “six months” comment, and soon.'

    interest rate outlook. Since last September investors had become remarkably secure
    in their belief that the Fed wouldn’t budge on interest rates until mid- to late-2015\.
    The Fed’s many reassurances since September formed and underpinned that conviction.
    Ms. Yellen and her colleagues have introduced a sliver of uncertainty around the
    edges of these calculations. Officials still don’t expect to move until next year.
    They still expect to move rates up very gradually once they start and to keep
    rates well below normal levels of 4% far into the future. But as they like to
    remind people from time to time, these decisions aren’t on a preset course.

    Yellen meant to send a strong signal of a shift in the reaction function. Second,
    while we agree that the most likely path for growth is a pickup to a 3%+ pace,
    the risk to this forecast is on the downside. Third, we expect a more gradual
    return to 2% inflation than the FOMC. Fourth, we see a significant risk that a
    tightening of financial conditions in the run-up to the first rate hike will delay
    the first hike, much as last summer''s "taper tantrum" delayed the actual move
