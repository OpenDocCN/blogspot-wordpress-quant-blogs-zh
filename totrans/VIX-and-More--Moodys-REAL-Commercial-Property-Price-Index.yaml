- en: 'Last week, in [Commercial Real Estate Problems Piling Up](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/04/commercial-real-estate-problems-piling.html),
    I opined that [commercial real estate](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/commercial%20real%20estate)
    is a likely candidate to usher in the next leg of the financial crisis. Since
    the [S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index](http://www2.standardandpoors.com/portal/site/sp/en/us/page.topic/indices_csmahp/0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0.html)
    gets so much publicity, I thought this would be a good opportunity to mention
    a commercial real estate index that deserves more attention: the [Moodys/REAL
    Commercial Property Price Index](http://web.mit.edu/cre/research/credl/rca.html).'

    slightly more than 20% since the October 2007 peak.

    has already been told. The rest of the real estate story – good or bad – likely
    lies on the commercial side.
