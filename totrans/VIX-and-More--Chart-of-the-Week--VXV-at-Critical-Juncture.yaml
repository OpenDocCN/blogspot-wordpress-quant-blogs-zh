    as a candidate for the Stock of the Week, but since there have been so many posts
    and charts about both subjects, I thought I might offer a slightly different twist.

- en: Yes, it is time for me to trumpet the importance of [VXV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXV)
    once again. For those who may have forgotten, VXV’s formal name is the CBOE S&P
    500 3-Month Volatility Index. The CBOE describes the index in detail [here](http://www.cboe.com/micro/vxv/3monthvix.pdf),
    but the key takeaway is that VXV is essentially a 93-day version of the 30-day
    VIX. In other words, whereas VIX looks out at just one month of potential volatility
    and disruptions to the financial markets, VXV has a time horizon of one quarter.
    This means, among other things, that while both capture the essence of the Q1
    earnings reporting season, VXV includes *three* FOMC meetings and three nonfarm
    payroll reports, among other things. And whereas there may be no significant developments
    regarding Greek debt restructuring, it is unlikely that this issue will not be
    addressed in the next three months.

    of long-term and [structural/systemic volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/structural%20volatility)
    than the VIX, which is better suited to measuring short-term [event volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/event%20volatility).

- en: Looking at a weekly chart of VXV since its October 2007 launch, one cannot help
    but notice a pattern of historical support in the 17.50 – 18.00 zone. Friday’s
    close took VXV down to 18.35\. A couple of closes below could signal not just
    a change in structural volatility and longer-term risk, but also the arrival of
    a new volatility regime.
