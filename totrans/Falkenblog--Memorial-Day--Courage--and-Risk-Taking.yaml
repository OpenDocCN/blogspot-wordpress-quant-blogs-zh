- en: I think we primarily celebrate military heroes out of a tradition of doing so,
    because in the past such people truly were responsible for our survival. For example,
    if the Mongol horde won the battle, they killed all the men and raped all the
    women. So guys willing to put their life on the line to prevent this were pretty
    important, and owed a debt of annual gratitude.

- en: But in modern conflict, it's not so obvious. The past 200 years of fighting
    seem pretty silly, as our old foes, Germans and Japanese, are so much just like
    us today its hard to think that even if they won they would have not turned out
    the same through some other means. The US Civil War killed a lot of people, but
    Brazil and Canada were able to move on from slavery without such a mess. And the
    Revolutionary war with Britain, seems a lot like an adolescent chaffing under
    the control of a parental unit (Tony Blair gave a speech in the US congress and
    made a joke about the War of 1812, funny because the cause of that war has zero
    resonance today, seemingly pointless).

  zh: 崇拜士兵提醒我们要庆祝勇气，但肉体上的勇气相对较容易受到尊敬，因为这是非常直观的。然而，我认为我们需要记住，大多数人面对的是知识上的勇气，而不是肉体上的勇气，就像今天大多数人从事的是知识上的工作，而不是肉体上的工作。
- en: There’s an important distinction between physical and intellectual courage.
    Physical courage is the ability to act despite the risk of pain, injury or death.
    Most ancient texts on courage are examples from male warrior culture. Old Testament
    heroes like Joshua and David and the warriors of Greek and Roman mythology demonstrated
    the heart and mind that led them to persist in the face of danger or hardship.
    Intellectual courage, in contrast, is mainly based on facing humiliation, the
    thought that one’s beliefs or actions might cause a loss of reputation or status,
    because rash risk-taking does lower one’s status. For an intellectual the risks
    and challenges of advocating courageous ideas is the likelihood of feeling or
    looking foolish, of not being accepted by colleagues and people one respects,
    and reputations have a lot of inertia.

  zh: 肉体上的勇气和知识上的勇气之间有一个重要的区别。肉体上的勇气是在痛苦、受伤或死亡的风险面前采取行动的能力。大多数关于勇气的古代文献都是来自男性战士文化。《旧约圣经》的英雄如约书亚和大卫以及希腊罗马神话中的战士展示了使他们在面对危险或困难时坚持不懈的勇气和心智。相比之下，知识上的勇气主要是基于面对羞辱，对于一个知识分子来说，冒险会降低他们的声望。知识上的勇气取决于提出勇敢的想法的风险和挑战，可能会感到或看起来愚蠢，没有得到同事和尊敬的人的认可，名誉具有很高的惯性。
- en: If you have objectively low alpha in what you are attempting, your willingness
    to attempt it will not be seen positively by your status group. They will see,
    based on their cues, you had no chance, and thus will be mocked for the obtuseness
    implied in such an objectively absurd form of risk-taking. To seriously try to
    dance with flair or wear a really eye-catching new outfit invites the scorn, the
    ridicule, of failing so bad, the joke is not the failure, but your mind-numbingly-clueless
    thought that you are John Travolta or Jennifer Lopez. And this holds for perverse
    persistence as well. An 18-year-old aspiring rock star is cool, a 43-year-old
    aspiring rock star is pathetic. Courage is therefore not viewed in isolation,
    because if it is rash or excessive it is considered merely foolhardy, not admirable.
    Physical courage perhaps is even more context dependent, as fighting for a dumb
    idea is courageous but shameful.

  zh: 如果你的尝试在客观上具有较低的主动收益，你尝试的意愿不会被你所在的地位群体所看好。他们会根据他们的暗示，在他们看来，你根本没有机会，因此会因为采取了如此客观荒谬的风险方式而被嘲笑出对该行为的愚蠢隐含的愚笨。真诚地试图带点风情跳舞或穿着一件真正抢眼的新衣服会招来失败的嘲笑、讥讽，笑话不是失败，而是你那麻木不仁的想法，认为自己是约翰·特拉沃尔塔或詹妮弗·洛佩兹。这也适用于错误的坚持。一个18岁的有抱负的摇滚音乐明星很酷，而一个43岁的有抱负的摇滚音乐明星则很可悲。因此，勇气不是孤立地被看待，因为如果它是轻率或过度的，被认为只是愚勇，而不是值得羡慕的。身体勇气，也许更加取决于背景，因为为了一个愚蠢的想法而战斗是勇敢的，但是令人羞耻的。

    time. My kids all learn about civil rights heroes as examples of courage, but
    it should be remembered that while Ruby Bridges and other people who fought for
    civil rights in the 50s and early 60s were courageous, supporting civil rights
    today is about one of the easiest things to do. It is easy to forget that Galileo's
    famous observation that all objects accelerate at the same speed was not so obvious.
    If you push something faster, it accelerates--a heavy weight pushes harder on
    your hand, ergo, it should push downward faster. Add to that the observation that
    leaves fall to the ground more slowly than rocks, and I could see why people would
    assume weight is positively correlated with acceleration. Around the same time,
    Tycho Brahe, the man whose measurements allowed Kepler to formulate his laws of
    motion, did not accept the heliocentric model of the solar system, in spite of
    his very good data and good natured persuasion from Kepler--isn't it obvious we
    are at rest?

    person will lessen his estimation of you, like those who believe in cold fusion
    or intelligent design. And it will only be respected, if you turn out to have
    been presciently correct. Of course, this is obviously true for investing, where
    those who called the internet boom in 1996, or bust in 2000, are considered courageous.

    making real breakthroughs, and it is only admirable in combination with other
    virtues, like prudence (ie, being right on scientific facts or prediction) and
    justice (being right on morality). If you broke conventional wisdom on something
    wrong, like those who fought for communism, or eliminated DDT from Africa, you
    were self-righteous, courageous, and also a fool whose actions created a lot of
    harm. We venerate physical courage of soldiers because, unlike intellectual courage,
    it is easier to measure, and generally presume it was for a righteous cause.
