    out of proportion... How about warriors who died on other sides, or in other wars?
    How about civilians who died or sacrificed in wars? How about those who prevented
    wars?

    because in the past such people truly were responsible for our survival. For example,
    if the Mongol horde won the battle, they killed all the men and raped all the
    women. So guys willing to put their life on the line to prevent this were pretty
    important, and owed a debt of annual gratitude.

    seem pretty silly, as our old foes, Germans and Japanese, are so much just like
    us today its hard to think that even if they won they would have not turned out
    the same through some other means. The US Civil War killed a lot of people, but
    Brazil and Canada were able to move on from slavery without such a mess. And the
    Revolutionary war with Britain, seems a lot like an adolescent chaffing under
    the control of a parental unit (Tony Blair gave a speech in the US congress and
    made a joke about the War of 1812, funny because the cause of that war has zero
    resonance today, seemingly pointless).

    somewhat easy to venerate because it is so intuitive. However, I think we need
    to remember most of us deal with intellectual, not physical, courage, in the same
    way most of us today are involved in intellectual, not physical, work.

- en: There’s an important distinction between physical and intellectual courage.
    Physical courage is the ability to act despite the risk of pain, injury or death.
    Most ancient texts on courage are examples from male warrior culture. Old Testament
    heroes like Joshua and David and the warriors of Greek and Roman mythology demonstrated
    the heart and mind that led them to persist in the face of danger or hardship.
    Intellectual courage, in contrast, is mainly based on facing humiliation, the
    thought that one’s beliefs or actions might cause a loss of reputation or status,
    because rash risk-taking does lower one’s status. For an intellectual the risks
    and challenges of advocating courageous ideas is the likelihood of feeling or
    looking foolish, of not being accepted by colleagues and people one respects,
    and reputations have a lot of inertia.

    to attempt it will not be seen positively by your status group. They will see,
    based on their cues, you had no chance, and thus will be mocked for the obtuseness
    implied in such an objectively absurd form of risk-taking. To seriously try to
    dance with flair or wear a really eye-catching new outfit invites the scorn, the
    ridicule, of failing so bad, the joke is not the failure, but your mind-numbingly-clueless
    thought that you are John Travolta or Jennifer Lopez. And this holds for perverse
    persistence as well. An 18-year-old aspiring rock star is cool, a 43-year-old
    aspiring rock star is pathetic. Courage is therefore not viewed in isolation,
    because if it is rash or excessive it is considered merely foolhardy, not admirable.
    Physical courage perhaps is even more context dependent, as fighting for a dumb
    idea is courageous but shameful.

- en: for those who were right, and were doing something that was unorthodox at the
    time. My kids all learn about civil rights heroes as examples of courage, but
    it should be remembered that while Ruby Bridges and other people who fought for
    civil rights in the 50s and early 60s were courageous, supporting civil rights
    today is about one of the easiest things to do. It is easy to forget that Galileo's
    famous observation that all objects accelerate at the same speed was not so obvious.
    If you push something faster, it accelerates--a heavy weight pushes harder on
    your hand, ergo, it should push downward faster. Add to that the observation that
    leaves fall to the ground more slowly than rocks, and I could see why people would
    assume weight is positively correlated with acceleration. Around the same time,
    Tycho Brahe, the man whose measurements allowed Kepler to formulate his laws of
    motion, did not accept the heliocentric model of the solar system, in spite of
    his very good data and good natured persuasion from Kepler--isn't it obvious we
    are at rest?

    person will lessen his estimation of you, like those who believe in cold fusion
    or intelligent design. And it will only be respected, if you turn out to have
    been presciently correct. Of course, this is obviously true for investing, where
    those who called the internet boom in 1996, or bust in 2000, are considered courageous.
    Those who were bearish in 1996, or bullish in 2000, however, are considered merely
    foolish.

    making real breakthroughs, and it is only admirable in combination with other
    virtues, like prudence (ie, being right on scientific facts or prediction) and
    justice (being right on morality). If you broke conventional wisdom on something
    wrong, like those who fought for communism, or eliminated DDT from Africa, you
    were self-righteous, courageous, and also a fool whose actions created a lot of
    harm. We venerate physical courage of soldiers because, unlike intellectual courage,
    it is easier to measure, and generally presume it was for a righteous cause.
