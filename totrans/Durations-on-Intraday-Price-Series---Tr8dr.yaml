    I intend to model quadratic variation in terms of multiple pairings of intensity
    (duration) and return level processes.   At a minimum want a pairing for “non-jump”
    related returns and a pairing for “jump” related returns.

    threshold.   We may further want to disregard price movements below a certain

    Towards this end my duration measurement function uses a threshold to determine
    whether a return is to be considered as an event or not.  In pseudocode:'
