    gold ETF's (GDX vs GLD), as well as between energy companies and oil ETF's (XLE
    vs USO). (See, for e.g.,

    why gold and oil may be cointegrated are very similar to that of bond yield and
    oil: as oil price rise a) the oil revenue is invested heavily in gold, therefore
    pushing up gold price; b) there is an upward pressure on inflation, which increases
    the appeal of gold as an inflation hedge.'

    spread certainly looks somewhat mean-reverting since the 90''s, it doesn''t pass
    the cointegration test. The reason may simply be that this spread mean-reverts
    at a glacial pace: I estimate that the half-life (see my explanation of this term'

    to convince ourselves of their cointegration. (My own data on crude oil and gold
    prices only go as far back as the 1990's. If any reader knows of historical data
    source that goes back further, please let me know.) If, however, one is willing
    to take their cointegration by faith despite the inadequate data, then one may
    believe that gold is currently (as of Feb 12, 2007) just slightly undervalued
    relative to oil (the spread is about $8). I certainly don't recommend entering
    into a position on either side at this point!
