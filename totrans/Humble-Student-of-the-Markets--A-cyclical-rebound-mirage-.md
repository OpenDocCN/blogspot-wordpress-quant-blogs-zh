# Humble Student of the Markets: A cyclical rebound mirage?

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2022/11/a-cyclical-rebound-mirage.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2022/11/a-cyclical-rebound-mirage.html#0001-01-01)

["Price leads fundamentals", or "Don't fight the Fed"?](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2022/08/20/price-leads-fundamentals-or-dont-fight-the-fed/)

A similar divide may be appearing again, albeit not as wide. Technical internals has been pointing to a shift in leadership to value and cyclical sectors, indicating the emergence of cyclical green shoots. Further analysis of technical internals, as well as the macro picture, indicate that hope of a cyclical rebound may be an illusion.

Here's why.
