- en: In conclusion, until these trade tensions are resolved, expect the market to
    remain range-bound and move in reaction to the latest headlines. This suggests
    that traders should adopt a position of “buy the dips” and “sell the rips”. If
    history is any guide, I expect the current rally to peter out some time next week,
    with the most probable peak occurring about mid-week.

    and the market appears to be stalling at resistance. Is this simply a test and
    pullback to test resistance, or something worse?
