    the idea that I view the current market environment as a "fat pitch". If we use
    the analogy of a card counter in black jack, I can only determine when I bet aggressively.
    I cannot guarantee that I will get a winning hand even though the cards should
    be in my favor. Nonetheless, I would always prefer to bet when the chance for
    strong gains is likely. This is just one aspect of the "fat pitch". The other
    aspect and it may be more important than all those potential gains is that a failed
    signal tends to portend a poor outcome for the markets. Based upon my data, I
    have clearly defined risk parameters, and this is what is so good about the "fat
    pitch" --possibility for strong gains plus the ability to define my risk.

    about entering a trade with “defined risk parameters” and that “a failed signal
    tends to portend a poor outcome for the markets.”

    bullish to bearish. The primary reason is that whereas in February, when the bulls
    were still in control of the tape, today the bears are in control. The change

    informed me that leverage is still on at hedge funds and major institutional long-only
    accounts are still positioned for a recovery and not a correction. As good traders
    know, overbought markets can get more overbought and oversold markets can get
    more oversold. If bearish momentum continues to carry the day, then there is still
    a lot of pent-up selling to be done.

    economists generally believe that markets are self-correcting (and therefore oversold
    bounces are more likely) because there are many independent market participants
    expressing their views. What if the views aren’t independent but self-reinforcing?

    your bullish or bearish views, I agree with the views of Technical Take (see above).
    This is an extremely volatile market and it's important to define your risk parameters.
