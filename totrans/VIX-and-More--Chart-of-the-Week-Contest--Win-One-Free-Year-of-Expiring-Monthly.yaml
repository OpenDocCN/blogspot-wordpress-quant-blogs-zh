    the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week)
    back in February that I have decided to make the contest a recurring feature on
    the blog. So this Sunday, I will be publishing a reader submission as the official
    *VIX and More* chart of the week. As a further enticement, I will also award a
    free one year subscription to [*Expiring Monthly: The Option Traders Journal*](http://www.expiringmonthly.com/)
    to the winner.'

    will give strong preference to ideas and graphics that are insightful, topical,
    creative and fresh. Extra points will also be given to provocative and/or humorous
    submissions. In terms of subject matter, I am open to anything that is at least
    loosely associated with investing and economics. Back in February, the majority
    of the submissions were related to the VIX, but given all the interesting developments
    in the markets in the last month or so, I would hope to see charts covering a
    broad range of ideas. All graphics should be submitted no later than 6:00 PT on
    Sunday, June 6^(th).**'
