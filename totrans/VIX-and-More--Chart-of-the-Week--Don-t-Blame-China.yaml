- en: Last week’s financial headlines were dominated by [Spain](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Spain)
    and [China](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/China). In the case of
    Spain, this was largely due to increased borrowing by Spanish banks from the European
    Central Bank. For China the culprit was Q1 GDP growth of only 8.1%, which was
    down from 8.9% in Q4 2011 and well short of the 9.0% whisper number that made
    the rounds in the day leading up to Friday’s announcement. In fact, once could
    certainly argue that it was China’s GDP whisper number that was the main catalyst
    for Thursday’s big rally that was essentially reversed on Friday.

  zh: 上周的财经头条被[西班牙](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Spain)和[中国](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/China)所主导。在西班牙的情况下，这主要是因为西班牙银行从欧洲中央银行增加了借款。对于中国，罪魁祸首是Q1
    GDP增长仅为8.1%，低于2011年Q4的8.9%，也远低于在周五宣布前一日流传的9.0%的预期数字。事实上，许多人可能会认为，正是中国的GDP预期数字成为了周四的大幅上涨的主要催化剂，而这一上涨在周五基本上被逆转。
- en: The [chart of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week)below
    shows the performance of SPY as well as country ETFs for Spain ([EWP](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EWP)),
    [Italy](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Italy) ([EWI](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EWI))
    and China ([FXI](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/FXI)) since stocks
    put in a top two weeks ago tomorrow. The chart shows that while SPY has been declining,
    country ETFs for Spain and Italy have been falling approximately three times as
    quickly as their American counterparts. And China? Well, don’t blame China for
    the woes in the U.S. stock market. While U.S. stocks have been selling off, the
    performance of the popular [iShares FTSE/Xinhua China 25 Index](http://www.ishares.com/product_info/fund/overview/FXI.htm),
    FXI, has managed to post a 0.9% gain.

  zh: 下方的[本周图表](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week)显示了SPY以及西班牙([EWP](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EWP)),
    [意大利](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Italy) ([EWI](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EWI))和中国([FXI](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/FXI))自两周前股票触顶以来的表现。图表显示，尽管SPY在下降，但西班牙和意大利的country
    ETFs下降的速度大约是美国同行的三倍。那中国呢？好吧，不要怪中国是美国股市困境的原因。在美国股市下跌的同时，流行的[iShares FTSE/Xinhua
    China 25 Index](http://www.ishares.com/product_info/fund/overview/FXI.htm), FXI的表现设法实现了0.9%的上涨。

    extremely popular feature in this space since its launch in 2008, as my posting
    had become sporadic. Going forward I hope to be able to continue my recent regular
    posting and make this a weekly feature that not only shines a light on key developments
    of the past week, but also has some archival value as well.]*'
