    in 2016.  Without thinking about it too much, I was fairly certain I was going
    to devote the column to the many threats that had the potential to spiral out
    of control during the course of the year, but before I had an opportunity to start
    translating my thoughts into writing, other pundits started weighing in with their
    predictions for 2016 and without exception, everyone who ventured a guess on the
    direction of volatility was adamant that volatility would be substantially higher
    in 2016 than 2015.

    all of the pundits agree that volatility will be up, making a bet on rising volatility
    one of the year’s most popular trading ideas.**But, as is the case with much of
    the investment landscape, when most of the pundits agree about how the future
    will unfold, it pays to investigate the contrarian point of view.**As to volatility,
    the contrarian perspective is particularly compelling for 2016 because volatility
    is notoriously hard to predict; investors have a habit of dramatically overestimating
    its future level; and, when it comes to forecasting the causes of volatility,
    “experts” and investors alike have a penchant for fighting the last war.”*'

    January was one of the worst first months on record, with the S&P 500 Index falling
    7.3% for the month.  The bearish trend continued into February, as fears related
    to China and crude oil had investors selling en masse.  By the time stocks found

    prediction was spot on and the rest of the pundits ended up on the wrong side

    perspective.  Genius?  Probably not, but definitely more right than wrong, despite
    my having to wear a dunce cap for the first two months of the year.

    herd mentality and crowded trades.  Additionally, there are also issues regarding
    how investors frame a problem or potential problem.  For example, when one expects
    an increase in volatility they are more likely to be overprepared for that development
    and/or overreact when there are initial signs of an increase in volatility.  Ironically,
    if investors load up on SPX puts or VIX calls, then this makes it much more difficult
    for panic to filter into the market.  This leads to a theme that has been repeated
    often in this space:  VIX spikes are notoriously difficult to predict and it is
    also more difficult to anticipate a change in volatility regimes than many believe.

    almost always overshoot realized volatility, which is why in the last 27 years
    only the extreme turmoil in 2008 saw realized volatility higher than the VIX over
    the course of a full year.
