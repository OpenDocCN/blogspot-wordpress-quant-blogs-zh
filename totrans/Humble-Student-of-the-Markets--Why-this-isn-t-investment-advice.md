# Humble Student of the Markets: Why this isn't investment advice

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2013/04/why-this-isnt-investment-advice.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2013/04/why-this-isnt-investment-advice.html#0001-01-01)

Recently, I have gotten a number of comments like this one from my post

[You just don't understand Europe](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2013/03/you-just-dont-understand-europe.html)

:

> Cam you were wrong about Europe outperformance relative to US in your prediction for 2013.I am European I know Europe. Don't make mistake of doubling up on your losses.

Some of my readers mistake this blog as investment advice. I draw everyone's attention to the disclaimer that is at the bottom of every blog post, which reads in part [emphasis added]:

 *> *None of the information or opinions expressed in this blog constitutes a solicitation for the purchase or sale of any security or other instrument. **Nothing in this article constitutes investment advice and any recommendations that may be contained herein have not been based upon a consideration of the investment objectives, financial situation or particular needs of any specific recipient.** **Any purchase or sale activity in any securities or other instrument should be based upon your own analysis and conclusions.** Past performance is not indicative of future results. Either Qwest or Mr. Hui may hold or control long or short positions in the securities or instruments mentioned.** **What is an investment process?**

You shouldn't use this blog for investment advice. Let me explain. Most investment processes consist of at least the following three steps:

1.  Decide on what to buy and sell.
2.  Decide on how much to buy and sell.
3.  Timing the trade.

As an investment manager, I would add a four step of "review and control", which consists of analyzing past decisions and understanding what went wrong and what went right in order to improve future decisions.

I write this blog as my way of thinking out loud and inviting feedback. Most of what I write relates to step 1\. There is little or no discussion of steps 2 or 3\. Even if we both agreed that security XYZ is a good idea, I have no idea about your circumstances or your portfolio. I can't tell you how much to buy or whether it is appropriate for you at all.

Moreover, if I advocate entering a position, don't be assured that I will write about my decision to exit the position. Consider this post where I wrote in early December about the market leadership of European stocks and homebuilders (see

[Some surprising market leaders](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2012/12/some-surprising-market-leaders.html)

). Even though I had identified European stocks as market leaders, it didn't mean that I don't have a risk control discipline. The chart below shows the relative performance of the ETFs for Euro STOXX 60 (FEZ) against MSCI All-Country World Index (ACWI):

When the relative trend break occurred in early February, we were out of the trade. I didn't write about it on this blog, nor did I feel any obligation to write about it on this blog.

You can see a similar pattern in the homebuilders of when we exited the position at the relative trend break.

**You get what you pay for**

The best way to use the content in this investment blog as a source for ideas. But understand that you get what you pay for - and it's not investment advice.

If you do want investment advice, then I need to have an up close and personal relationship with you, where I am getting paid a fee. If you believe, for example, that the fund that I manage is appropriate for you, then I will undergo the four steps that I outlined above.

Otherwise, use my ideas at your own peril.
