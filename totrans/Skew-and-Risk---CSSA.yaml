    sovereign defaults to bank failure to war in the Middle East. The ability to follow
    broad and protracted trends across global markets and commodities has never been
    more difficult. This explains the recent popularity of volatility index trading
    and also asset allocation methods that employ volatility management. The subject
    of managing tail risk by looking at “skew” is rarely discussed but remains an
    important complement to volatility.

    the calculations cited are often based on normal distributions which are not ideal
    for this type of measurement. Skew is simply the degree to which the average of
    the distribution is tilted from its midpoint (or median). When measuring skew
    it is best to look at returns versus prices.

- en: 'If the daily skew is positive, then the average of  daily returns is greater
    than the median of daily returns. This implies that there are probably positive
    outliers in the data–the “good” tail (95th percentile for example)  is often larger
    than the “bad” tail (the 5th percentile) . In the case that the skew is negative,
    the opposite is true: there are probably negative outliers in the data, and the
    “bad” tail is larger than the “good” tail.  ***Essentially, skew is a measure
    of the possibility of favorable or unfavorable surprises. ***This concept is different
    than just looking at a simple moving average of prices or the average of daily
    returns, because the skew can have a different sign than the measure of central
    tendency. The average can be positive, while the skew can be negative and vice
    versa. That is why the skew can carry vital information for traders– it can be
    an early warning, and sometimes even a better indicator of future returns than
    just a simple average.'

    in today’s environment that is especially critical. The combination of volatility-sizing
    with skew can be a powerful method for risk management. In a subsequent post,
    I will demonstrate some practical applications of these concepts.
