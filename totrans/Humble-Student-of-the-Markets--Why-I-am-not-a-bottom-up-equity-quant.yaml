- en: I spent close to two decades of my career building bottom-up equity quantitative
    models to pick stocks, in Canadian, US and international markets. I was asked
    why I don’t do that anymore.

- en: My flippant answer was:“Been there, done that.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: My longer answer was that the competitive advantage of doing bottom-up quantitative
    analysis is being eroded to such an extent that alphas are rapidly diminishing.

- en: Let me explain. Back in the 1970s and 1980s, the task of performing equity quantitative
    analysis required a large commitment by an investment organization. Sure, there
    were databases around, but the task of integrating them was a non-trivial task
    that required investment in staff and infrastructure.

    the fundamental database is identified by company (as multiple share classes are
    not uncommon for non-US companies)?

    etc. The investment organization quickly finds itself not in the investment business,
    but the database maintenance business.

    Research Systems](http://www.factset.com/) have revolutionized the business and
    dramatically lowered the barriers to entry to bottom-up equity quantitative analysis.
    Today, you can build an equity quantitative research capability by subscribing
    to these services.

- en: Moreover, a generation of quants has been [conditioned by the likes of Barra](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2008/04/have-we-quants-been-brainwashed-by.html)
    to decompose risk as industry plus a Fama-French like common factors such as Market
    Capitalization and Style (Value/Growth).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The implications of this analysis framework is that just as opera singers are
    genetically imprinted not to belt when they sing, bottom-up equity analysts are
    conditioned to believe that you shouldn’t try to forecast the returns to these
    risk factors. Instead, the appropriate way to forecast alpha is to forecast alpha
    based on residual risk, or stock pick after controlling for, at the very least,
    industry and sector risk.

- en: The combination of lower entry barriers and groupthink has led equity quants
    into a crowded trade. They all uses some form of multi-factor stock selection
    model, but the data comes from the same databases. The factors all appear to be
    uncorrelated but we saw [what happened in August 2007](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1288988).

- en: I recently attended a seminar put on by a risk model vendor and a respected
    equity quant manager. The equity manager put up an analysis showing various ways
    of integrating their forecast alphas with the risk models that they use. The most
    optimal technique for a long only portfolio, with a 2-2.5% forecast tracking error,
    resulted in an annual alpha of about 1.5% a year.

- en: 1.5% sounds pretty good.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, you have to consider that this is a forecast alpha from a model portfolio
    with no turnover costs. Once you throw in trading costs, the shortfall between
    the turnover of the forecast alpha and the actual portfolio, which could vary
    greatly, and even the fact that good managers with tight investment processes
    experience portfolio dispersion (difference in returns between accounts with similar
    mandates) of 2% or more, 1.5% doesn’t sound that good.

- en: So far my solution has been to do something that is truly queasy and nauseating
    to many equity quants. I have been using top-down investing and factor rotational
    approaches to quantitative investing. The approach disturbs quants because it's
    less disciplined, less risk controlled (according to the way they are trained)
    and appears to be so, well, ***empircally*** oriented.

- en: My approach is not the only answer but bottom-up equity quants need to find
    new sources of alpha.
