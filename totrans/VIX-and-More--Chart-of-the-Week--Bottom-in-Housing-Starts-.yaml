- en: Conventional wisdom dictates that it is way too early to even contemplate a
    bottom in [housing](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/housing), where
    prices presumably have another 10-20% to fall. In light of the February housing
    starts data released on Tuesday, I am wondering if we might be closer to a bottom
    in housing than many of the pundits believe.

- en: This week’s [chart of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week)
    tracks housing starts going back to the beginning of 1980 and shows the January
    2009 number as an all-time low. The February data, which is subject to future
    revisions, shows a 22.2% increase from the January low in combined single-family
    (+1.1%) and multi-family (+82.3%) housing starts.

    data point that suggests a possible stabilizing of housing prices, increase in
    demand or significant decrease in inventories could cause a rapid reevaluation
    of where the housing market stands and where it may be going in 2009.

    home sales and Wednesday’s February new home sales very closely to see what the
    numbers tell us.
