# VIX and More: VIX Likely Headed for Third Highest Close Ever

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/11/vix-likely-headed-for-third-highest.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/11/vix-likely-headed-for-third-highest.html#0001-01-01)

There is still an hour and a half left in the trading day, but it is beginning to look like the VIX will close over 70 for the first time this month and record its third highest close ever.

At 2:37 p.m. ET the VIX is at 73.62, well off of the record 80.06 close from October 27 and the second place 79.13 close of October 24 from the preceding Friday.

A lot can -- and usually does -- happen in the last half hour, but clearly the markets have a long way to go before fear and anxiety start to recede.

[Edit: the final number on the VIX is 74.26, though the index did touch 75.00 for a moment]
