    like Obama's plan, what are you going to do?" The cowed quasi-libertarian then
    notes her affinity for increases to unemployment insurance, because it seems rather
    non controversial.

    the question reflects two flawed assumptions. First, that attempting to help generally
    helps. Second, that the situation will not improve without top down policies from
    Washington. Even Marx stated we should not judge policies based on their intentions,
    and the batting average for government relief programs is well below the

    get more of it, so increasing unemployment benefits increases the amount of unemployment.
    There really is not another side to this, as in the more well-known minimum wage
    debate.

    out of 15 countries with an unemployment rate 120% of the US had relatively generous
    unemployment benefits. He notes that generous unemployment benefits decreases
    the willingness of the unemployed to find employment, and increasing the duration
    of the entitlement increases long-term unemployment. In sum, raise unemployment
    benefits, expect a higher unemployment rate.

  zh: 史蒂芬·尼克尔的研究发现，从1983年到1996年，对美国和欧洲的研究发现，在15个国家中，有8个国家的失业率是美国的120%，这些国家的失业救济相对较为慷慨。他指出，慷慨的失业救济减少了失业者寻找就业的意愿，并且延长了享受救济的期限，则会增加长期失业率。总而言之，提高失业救济，就意味着更高的失业率。
- en: Everything has costs and benefits. The benefits of increasing unemployment insurance
    is the increased income of those getting more benefits, and--though this is highly
    cynical--that those supporting such transfers win status or votes by signaling
    their compassion through their willingness to support redistribution (it is easy
    to win votes when a disproportionate amount of the wealth comes from a minority).
    The costs are delaying the millions of individual transitions needed in the economy,
    because recessions basically inform us that we need fewer people in some fields
    and companies and more in others. What should the unemployed do next? I don't
    know, and people in Washington don't know either, because it depends on the specific
    skills of those diverse unemployed individuals and what the market is paying for
    those skills, data that is not available to our politburo. Only individuals are
    in the best position to solve this problem, and giving them cash may actually
    not be in their best interest because it just delays inevitable hard choices.

  zh: 一切都有成本和收益。增加失业救济的好处在于那些获得更多救济金的人的收入增加，而且--尽管这是高度愤世嫉俗的--那些支持这种转移的人通过他们愿意支持重新分配来表示他们的同情心，从而赢得了地位或选票（当财富的绝大部分来自少数人时，很容易赢得选票）。成本在于延迟经济中数百万个个体转变所需的时间，因为衰退基本上告诉我们，我们需要更少的人在一些领域和公司工作，而在其他领域和公司则需要更多的人才。失业者接下来该怎么办？我不知道，华盛顿的人也不知道，因为这取决于这些不同失业个人的具体技能，以及市场对这些技能支付的数据，这些数据对我们的政治局不可得。只有个人才能最好地解决这个问题，并给他们现金可能实际上并不符合他们的最佳利益，因为这只是延迟了不可避免的艰难选择。
