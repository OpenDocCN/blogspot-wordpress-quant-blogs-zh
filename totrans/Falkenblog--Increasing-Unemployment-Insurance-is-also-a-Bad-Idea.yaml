    like Obama's plan, what are you going to do?" The cowed quasi-libertarian then
    notes her affinity for increases to unemployment insurance, because it seems rather
    non controversial.

    the question reflects two flawed assumptions. First, that attempting to help generally
    helps. Second, that the situation will not improve without top down policies from
    Washington. Even Marx stated we should not judge policies based on their intentions,
    and the batting average for government relief programs is well below the

    get more of it, so increasing unemployment benefits increases the amount of unemployment.
    There really is not another side to this, as in the more well-known minimum wage
    debate.

    out of 15 countries with an unemployment rate 120% of the US had relatively generous
    unemployment benefits. He notes that generous unemployment benefits decreases
    the willingness of the unemployed to find employment, and increasing the duration
    of the entitlement increases long-term unemployment. In sum, raise unemployment
    benefits, expect a higher unemployment rate.

    is the increased income of those getting more benefits, and--though this is highly
    cynical--that those supporting such transfers win status or votes by signaling
    their compassion through their willingness to support redistribution (it is easy
    to win votes when a disproportionate amount of the wealth comes from a minority).
    The costs are delaying the millions of individual transitions needed in the economy,
    because recessions basically inform us that we need fewer people in some fields
    and companies and more in others. What should the unemployed do next? I don't
    know, and people in Washington don't know either, because it depends on the specific
    skills of those diverse unemployed individuals and what the market is paying for
    those skills, data that is not available to our politburo. Only individuals are
    in the best position to solve this problem, and giving them cash may actually
    not be in their best interest because it just delays inevitable hard choices.
