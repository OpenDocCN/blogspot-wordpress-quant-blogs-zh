    that the markets were expecting a highly dovish message that any hint of a balanced
    statement would cause the markets to sell off. Indeed, stock prices duly tanked
    as the FOMC statement appeared to have "disappointed" the market with a statement
    that was not even more dovish.

    were already built into bond prices.

    investors have plowed back into that sector and have reloaded the carry trade
    which fears of taper had led them to regurgitate in the May/July period. So if
    there is even a hint that that Fed might taper in 2013 that sector and associated
    spread product is at great risk.

    the 2 year/5 year spread traded as wide as 134 basis points in early September
    when the market was at its worst levels (10s traded 3 percent then). That spread
    is now bank to 97 basis points as fear of tapering has receded rapidly.

    go long the bond market here. The momentum in high frequency economic releases
    have been tanking, as shown by this chart of the Citigroup US Economic Surprise
    Index - and that should be conducive to lower bond yields (and therefore higher

    nearing a key level of technical support from both a chart support viewpoint but
    also a 38% Fibonacci retracement level. Should yields breach the key 2.43-2.50
    level, there could be further downside to yields.

    the 30-year yield shows that a similar topping pattern, but it has not reached
    the 38% Fibonacci support level yet, indicating further near-term downside.

    yields and higher bond prices. From a technical perspective, there is a better
    upside opportunity in the long Treasury in this trade.
