    people, who merely have a lack of resources. Sociologist and economists have taken
    this tact for years, because it seems condescending to do otherwise. In the early

- en: It's as if no one ever tried modeling the poor as being resource constrained,
    but instead economists have always assumed they are stupid or lazy. Nothing could
    be further from the truth. Further, the idea of providing welfare to the poor
    to rectify the situation has been tried, and is still there, and you can see its
    results in most urban American cities. We don't expect responsibility and so we
    don't get it, as opposed to what Glenn states, which is that all we do is preach
    self-responsibility to these poor ciphers of social forces. I suppose, like international
    aid, he thinks a

- en: The purpose isn't to make us feel morally superior, but rather, to design more
    effective remedies, to help the poor be all they can be, which may not be equality.
    It would be nice to our egalitarian instincts if everyone latched onto some socioeconomic
    achievement as if they were shot out of a randomizer, but what if that's not possible?
    What does that imply for policy? Is does not imply ought, but it does constrain
    what is possible, and highlights what is futile. If we treat the poor like MIT
    undergrads without wealth, and they don't respond as such, this only helps those
    who selfishly or naively preen about their moral righteousness, and the journalists
    and policymakers who think this line of thinking is novel.

    它不意味着应该，但它限制了可能性，并突显了徒劳无功的东西。 如果我们像对待麻省理工学院的本科生一样对待穷人，他们不会像那样回应，这只会帮助那些自私地或天真地自夸自己的道德正义以及认为这种思路是新颖的记者和政策制定者。
