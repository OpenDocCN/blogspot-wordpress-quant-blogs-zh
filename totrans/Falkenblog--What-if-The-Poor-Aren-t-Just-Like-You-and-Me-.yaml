    people, who merely have a lack of resources. Sociologist and economists have taken
    this tact for years, because it seems condescending to do otherwise. In the early
    20th century,

    or whatever. The corollary seems to be the Axiom of Equality: every group (race,income,religion,language,age,sex)
    has the same distribution of every phenotype given the same environment (except
    sex organs and melanin content). Thus ,the homeless are just people without homes,
    the poor simply people without money. Indeed, many homeless and poor are this
    way.'

- en: It's as if no one ever tried modeling the poor as being resource constrained,
    but instead economists have always assumed they are stupid or lazy. Nothing could
    be further from the truth. Further, the idea of providing welfare to the poor
    to rectify the situation has been tried, and is still there, and you can see its
    results in most urban American cities. We don't expect responsibility and so we
    don't get it, as opposed to what Glenn states, which is that all we do is preach
    self-responsibility to these poor ciphers of social forces. I suppose, like international
    aid, he thinks a

    effective remedies, to help the poor be all they can be, which may not be equality.
    It would be nice to our egalitarian instincts if everyone latched onto some socioeconomic
    achievement as if they were shot out of a randomizer, but what if that's not possible?
    What does that imply for policy? Is does not imply ought, but it does constrain
    what is possible, and highlights what is futile. If we treat the poor like MIT
    undergrads without wealth, and they don't respond as such, this only helps those
    who selfishly or naively preen about their moral righteousness, and the journalists
    and policymakers who think this line of thinking is novel.
