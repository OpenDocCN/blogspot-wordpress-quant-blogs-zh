    of all trading days](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/10/more-thoughts-and-numbers-on-spx-vix.html)
    – and [close to 90%](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/04/divergence-history-and-tells.html)
    of the time when the SPX moves at least 1% – I watched with considerable interest
    when the VIX followed the SPX and the rest of the broad indices down during the
    first hour of trading.

- en: As I write this, the SPX is down 0.54%, up a little from the 0.87% loss that
    represents the low of the day.  As the chart below shows, however, the VIX has
    been down below yesterday’s 26.08 close for the entire trading day.  For a brief
    period from 10:15 to 10:25 a.m., a high volume selloff in Lehman Brothers ([LEH](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=leh))
    triggered considerable investor anxiety and pushed the VIX up while the SPX slid,
    but now that this episode appears to be in the rear view mirror, the VIX is once
    again moving down.

    VIX coincident with a sideways to down SPX, while unusual, is a continuation of
    yesterday's trend.

- en: A high level of anxiety about the markets (i.e., a formidable ‘wall of worry’)
    and some indications that market sentiment may have bottomed can provide a solid
    base from which the markets can rebound.  Little by little, the markets will strengthen
    each time that investors shrug off bad macroeconomic news or when panic fails
    to materialize following weakness in the likes Lehman Brothers and other financials
    that are currently operating under a dark cloud of anxiety.

    indications that the markets are putting in a bottom and are prepared to move
    higher before all the toxins have had an opportunity to work their way through
    the financial system.
