    government to use--and will that inevitably lead to higher inflation? ***No, that's
    not what is happening, and that will not happen.*** Monetizing the debt means
    using money creation as a permanent source of financing for government spending.
    ***In contrast, we are acquiring Treasury securities on the open market and only
    on a temporary basis, with the goal of supporting the economic recovery through
    lower interest rates. At the appropriate time, the Federal Reserve will gradually
    sell these securities or let them mature, as needed, to return its balance sheet
    to a more normal size.***

    but "temporarily" holding them. But how credible is that exit strategy? Does anyone
    really believe that the Fed will normalize its balance sheet in the next few years?

- en: One radical option which is now being discussed is to cancel (or, in polite
    language, “restructure”) part of the government debt that has been acquired by
    the central banks as a consequence of quantitative easing (QE). After all, the
    government and the central bank are both firmly within the public sector, so a
    consolidated public sector balance sheet would net this debt out entirely.
