- en: Whist in Sydney recently I went to the “Introduction to React Native” [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/future-mobile-apps/events/222472223/)
    at the News Corp offices.  Both presentations were good, but the demo at the end
    was enlightening, and force me to return to my hotel, complete the rebuilding
    of a completely broken OSX, and execute the Getting Started [guide](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#content)
    over on the React Native site.  React [Parts](http://react.parts/native-ios) was
    mentioned in the presentation as being the place to go for appropriate components
    – although the few components briefly scanned did appears to be missing [tests](http://simonsmith.io/unit-testing-react-components-without-a-dom/)
    😦

    around building native iOS components.  Android appears to be possible with React
    Native in the future, and one can only assume Apple Watch iOS apps will also be
    supported
