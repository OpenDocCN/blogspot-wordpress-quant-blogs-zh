- en: There are a number of places on the web that provide short interest.  For individual
    stocks, I am partial to the data at [ShortSqueeze.com](http://www.shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=c&submit=Short+Quote%99).  Those
    seeking a broad brush perspective on large short positions and recent changes
    will likely prefer the [short interest highlights](http://online.wsj.com/mdc/public/page/2_3030-shortint_hi_nasdaq-NASDAQ.html)
    from the Wall Street Journal.

- en: My own favorite is the [short interest filter](http://www.schaeffersresearch.com/streetools/filters/short_int.aspx)
    at SchaeffersResearch.com.  This tool allows users to input data in five fields
    (see graph below) and generate a list of stocks that meet the specified criteria.  I
    have created one such list below from the criteria specified in the fields below.

- en: Knowing the short interest and associated trends in a stock can arm individual
    investors with a sense of the collective hedge fund speculative opinion on a particular
    security.  In markets that are trending down, these are often the stocks that
    get the most severe [Whac-A-Mole](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whac-A-Mole) treatment.  On
    the other hand, when the markets have one of those inevitable +300 days, look
    for the biggest gainers to be from the list of most heavily shorted companies
    with the highest [short interest ratios](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortinterestratio.asp).
