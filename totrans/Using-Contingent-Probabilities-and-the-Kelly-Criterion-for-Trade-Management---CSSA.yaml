    the mean-variance utility framework of Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT). The high
    priests of modern finance have suppressed this practical decision tool to protect
    their own devices, which is good –because it gives you an edge on the competition.

    leaving the probability of going broke equal to zero. Initially, it was used by
    blackjack players to determine how much to bet when they counted cards. When the
    count was high, they would have a higher expectation and would bet more. But the
    amount to bet was critical, because in actuality, the edge that a card counter
    has is actually quite small. It can vary between 52/48  for the player to 55/45
    when the deck is loaded with tens and aces (depending on the # of decks, BJ odds
    etc). Ironically the odds in the stock market for daily follow through (betting
    on an up day after a down day and vice versa)  are nearly identical, while the
    payoff is much smaller than doubling your bet every day. The Kelly Criterion is
    as follows:'

    market is that it was designed assuming that if you lose the entire wager is lost.
    From this perspective, it can be applied directly to options, but it  must be
    modified for practical use. You can theoretically never lose all your money by
    investing in the S&P500 for the next day. Before i get into contingent probabilities,
    lets discuss how I like to do this modification. First i divide the market into
    two states: 1) a bull market 2) a bear market. I establish this by determining
    whether the 252-day average is rising, that is if the 252-day average of SPY prices
    is greater than the day before, we are in a bull market. If the average is falling
    we are in a bear market. I compute the average daily price return and the probability
    of winning versus losing for each state. Here are the results on the SPY for the
    last 4000 bars:'

    long term trend times the relative VIX (volatility index) level. This is designed
    to normalize our bets under the assumption of a long-term VIX of 20\. It also
    forces us to bet less in bear markets, because they are inherently more volatile.
    In October 2008 when the VIX was 80, you would be betting only 25% of your portfolio
    (20/80).  Essentially ***B*** prevents us from getting into trouble by 1) forcing
    us to bet with the long-term trend, and therefore avoiding the fat-tails 2) it
    normalizes our bet-sizing so that we can use the same “wager”  which minimizes
    the effects of any one bad bet.

- en: 'The formula in the MDVK can be explained as follows: 1/2 represents the fact
    that we are betting 50% of the normal kelly recommendation. This is due to the
    fact that the true probabilities in the stock market are unknown, whereas in poker
    or blackjack they are know with certainty. This prevents the problem of overbetting,
    and the use a 1/2 adjustments tends to be near optimal out of sample.  This system
    is very conservative, but it basically is designed to minimize bet sizes when
    strong edges are not present. Returning to the equation,the 100/(1-kelly) represents
    the fact that we need to  adjust the betting amount upwards given that we will
    not lose 100% of our wager in one bet. Note that the MDVK was adjusted, and the
    maximum allocation is 300%—which in my opinion should not be exceeded to avoid
    crippling the account via a rare event. In the above example, assuming no other
    information, the MDVK would be calculated as follows:'

    is a very conservative allocation, a full kelly would dicate being 94% invested,
    but that gives little leeway to increasing bet sizes under the prescence of strong 
    additional edges. This is the subject of enhancement using contingent analysis,
    and will be completed during the weekend.
