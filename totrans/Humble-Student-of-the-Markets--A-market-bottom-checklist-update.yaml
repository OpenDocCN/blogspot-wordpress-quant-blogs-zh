    have signaled extreme levels of bearishness seen at past market bottoms. However,
    some observers have played down the sentiment surveys because indications of positioning
    are inconsistent with extreme fear. As an example, funds are still pouring into
    the Cathie Wood''s Ark Investment ETFs even as the speculative growth vehicles
    tank. That''s not the sort of behavior seen at washout bottoms. On the other hand,
    I have received a flood of emails and other messages of concern about the stock
    market indicating growing fear and panic.'
