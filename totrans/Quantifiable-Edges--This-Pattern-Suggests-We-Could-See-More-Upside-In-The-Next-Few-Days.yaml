    short-term strength is unusually impressive, it can create a situation where that
    extreme strength will beget more strength. When the market leaves an unfilled
    up gap that is considered a sign of strength.  When it does it 2 days in a row
    and closes at a 50-day high, that can be considered exceptional strength. That
    is what happened on Friday, and it triggered the study below, which I last shared
    on the blog on 9/10/12\.  All stats are updated to present day.

    consistent that at least some follow through was achieved in the next few days.
