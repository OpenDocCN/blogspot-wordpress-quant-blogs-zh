    the form of a more hawkish Fed. Inflation is running hot. When the Fed was officially
    in the transitory camp earlier this year, inflation pressures were concentrated
    in only a few components such as used cars. Today, price increases are broadening
    and even core sticky price CPI (red line) is rising strongly. As a consequence,
    the Fed made its hawkish pivot and signaled that it is on pace to end its QE program
    by March 2022, even though inflation expectations (black line) remain well-anchored.
