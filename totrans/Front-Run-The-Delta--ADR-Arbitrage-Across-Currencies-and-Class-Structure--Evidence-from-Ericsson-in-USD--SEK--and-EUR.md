# Front-Run The Delta: ADR Arbitrage Across Currencies and Class Structure: Evidence from Ericsson in USD, SEK, and EUR

> 来源：[https://frontrunthedelta.blogspot.com/2012/01/adr-arbitrage-across-currencies-and.html#0001-01-01](https://frontrunthedelta.blogspot.com/2012/01/adr-arbitrage-across-currencies-and.html#0001-01-01)

Ericsson is currently dual listed in

[Stockholm in SEK](http://www.ericsson.com/thecompany/investors)

,

[New York in USD](http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/eric)

, and

[Frankfurt in EUR](http://deutsche-boerse.com/dbag/dispatch/en/isg/gdb_navigation/home?module=InOverview_Equi&wp=SE0000108656&foldertype=_Equi&488733800)

.  The SEK shares consist of A and B classes, while the USD and EUR listed shares are both equivalent to the SEK class B shares.  This is a basic ADR structure traded through 3 currency pairs and 2 different class structures.

As evidenced in the first chart below, at the time of the recording, the USD-listed ERIC shares were equivalent in price to the SEK-listed ERIC.B shares.  Note the ERCB shares correspond to the right axis and trade at a roughly 50% discount to USD shares.  The Class A SEK-denominated ERIC.A shares trade at a discount to their own and USD-listed B Class equivalents.

This study incorporated the cash markets for the EUR/USD, EUR/SEK, and

[USD/SEK](http://frontrunthedelta.blogspot.com/2011/09/triangular-arbitrage-during-interbank.html)

exchange rates.  The principles of

[triangular arbitrage](http://frontrunthedelta.blogspot.com/search/label/triangular%20arbitrage)

were incorporated to derive values across the structure.

The Currency Adjusted USD-value Shares:

The US-listed shares register a bid/ask as early as 3am CST and track the SEK-listed B shares.  

The Currency Adjusted Openings:

As is usually the case for these studies, the outright share prices correspond to the left axis, while the spread value corresponds to the right axis.

**USD-listed shares vs. SEK-listed A and B Class shares.**

**EUR-listed B Class shares vs. USD-listed B Class shares.**

**EUR-listed B Class shares vs. SEK-listed A and B Class shares.**

A closer look at the turbulence in the bid/ask of the EUR-listed ERCB shares.  I believe this is similar in nature to some of the research posted by

.

And in the closing 5 minutes, the SEK-listed ERIC.B shares experience some unusual turbulence.  I don't like to speculate because this could have happened for any number of reasons (data integrity, software integrity, etc.), but judging by the increase in the bid/ask spread of the ERCB shares (EUR-listed), the market maker appears to have known it was coming.

A closer look at the overall spreads during the 8:30-10:30am CST market overlap. Again, in order as before.

**USD-listed shares vs. SEK-listed A and B Class shares.**

**EUR-listed B Class shares vs. USD-listed B Class shares.**

**EUR-listed B Class shares vs. SEK-listed A and B Class shares.**
