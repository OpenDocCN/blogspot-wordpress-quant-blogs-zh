- en: As we near the end of the quarter I’ve begun to hear quite a bit about the “end-of-quarter
    markup” phenomenon. I’ve also received a few questions about it. The theory is
    that mutual funds and other large institutions tend to “mark up” the prices of
    securities at the end of each quarter so that their return numbers look better.
    I decided to take a look.

    each quarter going back to 1960\. Of the 186 quarter-ends over the period, 90
    have had a positive last day of quarter, 94 finished negative, and 2 were basically
    dead even. The average win was 0.065%. The average loss was 0.06%. The net average
    day was 0.001%. Not even as good as an average day over the period.

    up to the last day of the quarter (like now). For instance, 7 times the market
    sold off at least 2.5% in the last 3 days of the month. Five saw gains on the
    last day and two saw more losses. Unfortunately, the losses nearly eclipsed the
    gains. Lowering the requirement to a 1.5% selloff in the preceding 3 days gave
    18 trades. 9 winners and 9 losers. Net expectancy was slightly negative.

    just before the last day of the quarter. Twenty occurrences. 10 winners. 10 losers.
    Slight negative expectancy.

    these studies.

- en: No matter how I looked I was not able to find any evidence of an end of quarter
    mark-up in the index. Perhaps mark-ups occur in individual securities, but it’s
    not apparent in the general market.
