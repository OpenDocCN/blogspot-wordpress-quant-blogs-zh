## Big Data BNPP: Machine-Learning

Came across an interesting [presentation](http://www.qminitiative.org/UserFiles/files/S_Cl%C3%A9men%C3%A7on_ML.pdf) recently over on the [QMI](http://www.qminitiative.org/) site.  The resources slide offers a few interesting links.  The dependency across assets reminds me of paired stocks but more. Shame there is little data on the technology used, other than Matlab.

Statistical Learning Methods  for Big Data Analysis and  Predictive Algorithm Development offers a buzzword bingo [slide](http://sea.ucar.edu/sites/default/files/StatLearnBigData20130401.pdf) (7) on statistical learning.
