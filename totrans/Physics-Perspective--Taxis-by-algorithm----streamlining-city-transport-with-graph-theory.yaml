    show how the taxi system in NYC could be made roughly 40% more efficient (fewer
    miles driven, lots less pollution, etc) with a taxi sharing system that would
    help people coordinate their trips. Making it work requires data and algorithms;
    the 40% improvement could be achieved, in principle, while introducing no more
    than a 5 minute delay to any person's trip.
