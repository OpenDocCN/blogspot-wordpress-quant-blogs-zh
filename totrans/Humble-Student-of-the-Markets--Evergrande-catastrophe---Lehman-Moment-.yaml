- en: 13 years ago yesterday, Lehman Brothers fell into bankruptcy. Today, the world
    is watching China Evergrande collapse in a debt spiral. The overly indebted property
    developer told China's major banks that it won't be able to pay loan interest
    due Sept. 20\. The company has been swamped with protests from individuals who
    invested in its paper through wealth management products, its employees and suppliers
    who haven't been paid, and numerous buyers who paid deposits for properties that
    haven't been constructed.
