    ‘concrete shoes’ and will never be able to keep its head above water. Time and
    time again the financials look like those concrete shoes: financials plunge; the
    market follows.'

- en: In fact the performance of financials relative to the broader market has been
    weakening steadily since early October 2006, when the ratio of financials ([XLF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLF))
    to the S&P 500 index (SPX) peaked. The chart below tracks this ratio since the
    beginning of 2006 and shows how financials have pulled the broader market down.
    Additionally, the chart reveals that almost every temporary improvement in the
    ratio has been an excellent shorting opportunity.

    some tradeable though short-loved opportunities on the long side. This morning
    the XLF and the XLF:SPX ratio are once again making new lows. Eventually the ratio
    will find a bottom. If the patterns in this chart hold true to form, the bottom
    in the ratio will precede a bottom in the SPX.
