## Thought on Microsoft 64GB Surface Pro

I’ve been using one of the Microsoft 64GB [Surface](http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msuk/en_GB/pdp/productID.277069200) Pro’s for a few days now.  Its interesting how people have come over to have a look at the machine itself, and the keyboard (or Touch Cover as I should term it).  What follows is a few thoughts on the device:

*   Most people are stunned by the thickness of the Surface – way to thick.  Microsoft needs to get Surface 2 out the door, and resolve this.
*   Has somewhat of a problem getting the time correct on the Surface.  Although I told it I was in London, it didn’t seem convinced until I went deep into the control panel settings – time sync server
*   The continuous horizontal scroll left is nice
*   Trying to install FireFox via the browser choice was painful.  I seem to have got stuck in a loop when asked if I wanted to allow the application to make changes to my machine.  Second time around the FireFox install worked better.
*   Re-ordering tiles on Start via the swipe down is a pain sometimes
*   Office dropping to the desktop is just wrong!
*   Weather app is quite nice from a available data perspective.  Makes the iOS weather app look and feel old
