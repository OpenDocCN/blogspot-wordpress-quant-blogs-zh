    “[normalcy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalcy)” into one of my posts [again](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/08/normalcy-again-vwsi-at-4.html)
    and what better way to do that than by putting under the microscope one of my
    favorite overlooked indices: the [CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index](http://www.cboe.com/micro/vxv/),
    which I typically reference with the more pithy [VXV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXV)
    ticker symbol.'

    [discuss](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/12/thinking-about-vxv.html) this
    index back in 2007, talk about the merits of the [VIX:VXV ratio](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%3AVXV)
    (which is a great way for someone without [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures)
    quotes to keep on top of the VIX futures [term structure](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/term%20structure)),
    devote an entire Barron’s column to the subject ([Take a Longer View on Volatility](http://online.barrons.com/article/SB124648899704482887.html))
    and promote VXV as a better reflection of long-term and [structural/systemic volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/structural%20volatility)
    than the VIX, which is better suited to measuring short-term [event volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/event%20volatility).

    above its December lows, VXV has now moved below those lows and it plumbing levels
    that have not been seen since early August – and as VXV is a better gauge of structural
    and systemic risk than the VIX (not to mention largely untouched by the [holiday
    effect](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Holiday%20Effect)), I think
    this is an important development to watch.

    I penned [Chart of the Week: VXV and Systemic Failure](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/04/chart-of-week-vxv-and-systemic-failure.html). 
    At that time I concluded, “The key takeaway: systemic healing is continuing and
    the risk of systemic failure is diminishing.” Based on the VXV chart, it appears
    as if we are at a similar moment in time right now.'
