# Humble Student of the Markets: Another Omen warning

**Mid-week market update**: In case you missed it, the market recently flashed a Hindenburg Omen last week. The criteria for the Omen was succinctly explained by [David Keller](https://stockcharts.com/articles/mindfulinvestor/2022/01/hindenburg-omen-signals-downsi-601.html) as:

*   The market is in an established uptrend;
*   A sharp expansion in both new highs and new lows, indicating indecision; and
*   A momentum break.

To be sure, Hindenburg Omens aren't bearish until we see a cluster of Omen signals within a short period. Since last week's Omen was a singular event, we should only treat it as a warning and not an actionable signal.
