    outlook in Japan after its domestic asset bubbles popped in the early 1990s and
    that for the euro area in the present crisis. The performance of the Japanese
    economy 20 years ago was better than that of the euro area more recently. The
    Nikkei 225 peaked at the start of 1990\. GDP was 7 percent higher 4.5 years later,
    according to the IMF’s measure in constant prices.

    revenues and rising social security spending also contributed to the increase
    in the fiscal deficit in the early 1990s. To consolidate public finances, the
    government raised value-added taxes in 1997 with the onset of the Asian crisis,
    which some observers regard as having postponed the recovery.” Demographic similarities
    are striking as well.

    contrast in proposed response between the Draghi ECB and the Bernanke Fed, which

    directly by offering an implicit carrot and a stick. The carrot the ECB can offer
    is easy monetary policy should eurozone governments implement these policies.
    The stick is that, should member governments stray from the prescribed course,
    to leave them to the mercy of the bond market vigilantes.

    is to prod member governments to become more Austrian - lower deficits through
    "good austerity" and structural reforms at the microeconomic level so that it's
    easier to do business and be competitive. The Bernanke solution is for the Fed
