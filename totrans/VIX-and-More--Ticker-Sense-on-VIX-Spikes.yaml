    of the [four previous instances](http://tickersense.typepad.com/ticker_sense/2007/08/spike-in-the-vi.html)
    where the VIX has risen more than 100% in a three month period.

    the greater the rebound in this index during the following month, as shown in
    the following chart, which is courtesy of Birninyi Associates / Ticker Sense:'

- en: An even more interesting finding – and one consistent with the capitulation
    theory – is that in each of the five instances (assuming last week’s VIX spike
    will turn out to be the top this time around), the largest move in the VIX came
    during the last 20% of the VIX run-up period.
