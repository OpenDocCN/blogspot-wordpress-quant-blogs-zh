- en: Whilst on a flight recently I finally got around to [reading](http://www.amazon.com/Agile-Product-Management-Scrum-Development/dp/0321605780)
    “Agile Product Management with Scrum”.  As usual the book, like most good books,
    offers at least a few reminders and new thoughts on concepts that are key to get
    correct on projects.

- en: My main issue however is still that so many people involved in projects lack
    an understanding (and thus reading) in the reason for project failures (usually
    because they have no engineering interest).  This effectively leads to a high
    percentage of projects moving into an unacceptable risk area early on in a project,
    which only spirals causing teams and stakeholders to loose trust, focus and therefore
    inevitably money 😦

    all staff on some basic engineering principles, and the top 10 risks/issues that
    causes projects to fail.  Sticking your head in the sand on a project should not
    be accepted in this day and age!

    a slowdown in decision making, and a decrease in productivity and morale”.   Lack
    of engagement will always causes issues.  If you fail to engage, accept the consequences!

    Product (MVP): “The original iPhone shipped without many features that were standard
    on existing phones: copy and paste, the ability to send text messages to multiple
    recipients, and a software development kit, for instance. These limitations, though,
    did not hinder its success. “'

     Its key in my view to understand project engineering (as above), because without
    at least a basic understanding of software engineering, decision will be made
    that will inevitably mean money is wasted.

    of stakeholders who lack any engineering/agile knowledge. Ultimately the team
    will fail leading to morale issues, resignations, and effectively a broken product.

    bible.  All projects have similar but different issues.
