    the equal-weighted Continuous Commodity Index, which is in a minor downtrend.
    Though it doesn't seem disastrous and commodity prices have firmed somewhat in
    the past three weeks, the price action of the commodity complex is not exactly signaling
    a robust global recovery.

    is making new highs. My momentum and trend following models are telling to stay
    long. My relative strength models are telling me to rotate into defensive sectors
    like Utilities and Healthcare. When I net this all out, I wind up in a fairly
    neutral position.
