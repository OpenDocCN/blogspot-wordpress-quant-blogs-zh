- en: ': Not much has changed since my last post, so I just have a brief update during
    a thin and holiday-shortened week. The S&P 500 remains in a shallow upward channel
    while flashing a series of "good overbought" conditions during a seasonally positive
    period for equities. The index staged an upside breakout at the 3700 level. The
    breakout has held and the market gapped up on Monday. The bears need the index
    to retreat and fill in the gap as a minimum signal of market weakness.'
