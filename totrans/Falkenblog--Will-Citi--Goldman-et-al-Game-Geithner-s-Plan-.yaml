    this game. Enron could game California's energy market because they were the clear
    dominant player, and too few people were looking at it. Further, Enron was gaming
    the system so that those implementing the plan were making the money. Player A
    was making money for player A, as opposed to having player A make money for player
    B. Collusions, like secrets, are very hard to keep as the number of players goes
    from 1 to 5\. Ever try to keep a great secret with 5 of your best friends in school?

- en: Consider the scenario where the asset management arm of Citibank buys assets
    of JPMorgan, in an implicit quid-pro quo with JPMorgan's asset management group
    buying assets from Citibank. The criticism implies the asset management group
    is overpaying for these assets. The benefit of this collusion occurs at the Corporate
    Level, not to asset management, which expects to lose money. Thus, there would
    have to be discussions between the CEOs and their Asset Management chiefs on the
    'plan' with emphasis than this plan must be seen in the 'bigger picture'. Supposedly,
    the Asset Management players would be promised some kind of future cushy job instead
    of bonus payment. Further, this strategy would be risky because the banks with
    the targeted assets are not the majority of only players lined up to bid on these
    securities. If they are overbidding, Treasury officials should see a clear pattern
    (winning bid disproportionately from a bank-owned asset manager), and one would
    have to hope Treasury is too stupid to figure it out (probability between zero
    and 1).

  zh: 考虑这样一种情形，即花旗银行的资产管理部门购买了摩根大通的资产，并以摩根大通的资产管理集团购买花旗银行的资产为回报。批评意味着资产管理集团为这些资产支付了过高的价格。这种勾结的好处发生在公司层面，而不是资产管理方面，资产管理方面预计会亏损。因此，CEO和他们的资产管理主管之间必须要讨论这个“计划”，强调这个计划必须被看作是“大局”的一部分。据说，资产管理人员将被承诺某种未来的舒适工作，而不是奖金支付。而且，这种策略也是有风险的，因为拥有目标资产的银行不是唯一一家准备对这些证券进行竞标的银行。如果他们出价过高，财政部官员应该能够看出一个明显的模式（从银行旗下的资产管理公司中赢得的出价比例过高），并且人们不得不希望财政部太愚蠢无法了解（概率介于零和1之间）。
