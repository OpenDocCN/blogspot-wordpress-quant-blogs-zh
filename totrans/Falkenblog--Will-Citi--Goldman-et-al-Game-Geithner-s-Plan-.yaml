- en: ). The analogy to Enron is not applicable because there are more players to
    this game. Enron could game California's energy market because they were the clear
    dominant player, and too few people were looking at it. Further, Enron was gaming
    the system so that those implementing the plan were making the money. Player A
    was making money for player A, as opposed to having player A make money for player
    B. Collusions, like secrets, are very hard to keep as the number of players goes
    from 1 to 5\. Ever try to keep a great secret with 5 of your best friends in school?

- en: Consider the scenario where the asset management arm of Citibank buys assets
    of JPMorgan, in an implicit quid-pro quo with JPMorgan's asset management group
    buying assets from Citibank. The criticism implies the asset management group
    is overpaying for these assets. The benefit of this collusion occurs at the Corporate
    Level, not to asset management, which expects to lose money. Thus, there would
    have to be discussions between the CEOs and their Asset Management chiefs on the
    'plan' with emphasis than this plan must be seen in the 'bigger picture'. Supposedly,
    the Asset Management players would be promised some kind of future cushy job instead
    of bonus payment. Further, this strategy would be risky because the banks with
    the targeted assets are not the majority of only players lined up to bid on these
    securities. If they are overbidding, Treasury officials should see a clear pattern
    (winning bid disproportionately from a bank-owned asset manager), and one would
    have to hope Treasury is too stupid to figure it out (probability between zero
    and 1).

    conspiracy is crowded, convoluted, illegal, and uncertain. Would you play such
    a game?
