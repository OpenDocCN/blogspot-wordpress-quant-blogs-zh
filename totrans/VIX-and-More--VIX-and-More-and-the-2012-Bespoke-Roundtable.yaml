    about 2011 and 2012 as a part of [Bespoke Investment Group](http://www.bespokeinvest.com/)’s
    third annual Roundtable.

    do over the course of a four-week expiration cycle can be a humbling experience.
    Since I rarely focus the bulk of my thinking more than two or three expiration
    cycles into the future, I always embrace the process of what I have come to think
    of as Bespoke’s comprehensive 37 question “take-home final.” Of course you don’t
    have to have an opinion about every issue out there to be a successful investor,
    but being informed about as many issues as possible makes you better prepared
    when the next surprise hits. As I noted in [The Education of a Trader](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/09/education-of-trader.html),
    anyone who has ever uttered, “Do we have to know this for the test?” is not cut
    out for trading, as every day in the financial markets is an open book pop quiz.

- en: When it comes to formulating answers to these 37 questions, I tried to balance
    what I think are the most likely scenarios with more provocative comments about
    some low probability scenarios that I believe that a higher likelihood of coming
    to fruition than the rest of the crowd. The result is typically a patchwork of
    the unexciting and the outrageous. In 2012 it looks like I am leaning more toward
    the unexciting end of the scale, which is not difficult to do in a year in which
    the Mayan calendar [may be predicting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_phenomenon)
    the end of the world, while many pundits are calling for at a minimum the end
    of the euro zone as we know it. That being said, I do think I have some provocative
    things to say about a wide range of issues, from Apple ([AAPL](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/AAPL))
    vs. Google ([GOOG](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/GOOG)) to social
    networking and beyond.

    predictions for 2010 are [here](http://bespokepremium.com/roundtable/vixandmore/2010/).
    If I can locate a link to my (decidedly less impressive) 2011 predictions, I will
    post that here as well.
