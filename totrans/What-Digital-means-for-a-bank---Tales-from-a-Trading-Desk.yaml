- en: We’ve digitized our processes to make transactions clear and easy for our customers.
    We’ve invested heavily in channels and touchpoints with our customers, introducing
    mobile and other technologies so that we can offer our services 24/7, anytime,
    anywhere. We’ve invested in analytics and in getting a 360-degree view of customers
    to better empower them to make important decisions about their financial assets.

- en: Our HR processes weren’t fit for that purpose, so two years ago, we looked outside—specifically,
    at Netflix and what they were doing. We found the five-stage [Dreyfus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition#Dreyfus_Model)
    model,4 which is based on observable behaviors, not the number of diplomas you
    have. It measures how you acquire knowledge, how you apply it, and how you transfer
    it across teams and the organization. We defined our own five stages of IT-engineering
    performance. We involved the engineers themselves in this process. We asked them
    which areas of knowledge and which competencies they would expect themselves and
    their peers to have at various levels of maturity.

- en: one important initiative has been a new three-week onboarding program, also
    inspired by Zappos, that involves every employee spending at least one full week
    at the new Customer Loyalty Team operations call center taking customer calls.
    As they move around the key areas of the bank, new employees quickly establish
    their own informal networks and gain a deeper understanding of the business
