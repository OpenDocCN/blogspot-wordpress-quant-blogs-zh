- en: Early on in my forays into technical research, it was clear that no one simple
    indicator was adequate for all seasons. The first indicator that I introduced—the
    DV2—showed strong performance across the board on a variety of ETFs and stocks,
    but seemed to perform best during volatile conditions. This was true regardless
    of whether you looked at bull or bear markets. During quiet conditions where price
    moved higher, a binary (long below 50, short above 50) strategy often exited prematurely
    from trades, and made the dual mistake of going short well in advance of true
    short-term peaks. When you combine these muted gains per trade in this scenario
    with commissions, it cuts into the overall returns substantially. Two of our researchers
    addressed this problem independently in a novel way by utilizing different indicators
    that were ideal for these separate market conditions. David Abrams and Scott Walker,
    wrote an [innovative paper](http://www.daveab.com/mr_swing/) on a new quantitative
    system that David presented at the [NAAIM Uncommon Knowledge 2010 Conference](http://www.naaim.org/annualconference.aspx)
    in the Secret Sauce Trading Seminar.  This classic “out of the box” mentality
    is critical in order to create unique systems and portfolio management tools to
    gain an edge on the competition.

    topics you rarely see in published papers on trading systems.  It reveals advanced
    “underneath the hood” techniques in building a robust and adaptive trading system. 
    The paper also demonstrates how this system complements buy and hold and the longer-term
    trend following portfolios, like the Ivy Portfolio by providing counter-cyclical
    returns. This concept is important—because it highlights swing trading as a true
    diversifier and return-enhancer primarily because it harvests volatility efficiently
    in conditions that are often unfavorable for trend-following.

    portfolio of non-correlated components with a full cross-correlation matrix. 
    A set of long-only ETFs are held above the 10 month SMA for the basic long-term
    portfolio.  Then a conservative version of MR Swing is allocated to 20% of the
    portfolio.  The table below illustrates a key finding in the paper that adding
    in a 20% asset allocation of MR Swing to the portfolio further substantially increases
    the returns, while reducing the risk.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: (1)    ***Market-regime-switching*:** uses short-term mean reversion in the
    bear regime and intermediate term swing trading the bull regime.  This takes advantages
    of changes in market character based on the current regime state.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: (2)    ***Non-symmetrical trading algorithms****:* uses a blended approach instead
    of a single indicator.  MR swing employees the ValueChart for entries and the
    SVAPO for exits in swing trading.  It uses DV2 for mean reversion in the bear
    regime.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: (3)    ***Volatility adaptive metrics*:** every component is carefully chosen
    to robustly handle changes in market volatility.  A market regime trading channel
    is used to reduce whipsaws.  The DV2 normalizes price distributions using the
    CSS classic non-parametric PercentRank technique.  An adaptive standard deviation
    band is used for the volume and price oscillator SVAPO for swing trade exits. 
    Also, a dynamic volatility unit is built into the Value Chart entry method.

- en: (4)    ***Robustness to regime whipsaws:*** instead of trying to eliminate whipsaws
    in the regime model, MR Swing instead structures each component to be able to
    withstand whipsaws.  That means, an entry in the swing trading regime must be
    able to handle a change to the mean-reversion regime without causing the system
    to become unstable.  MR Swing is designed to address these cases and ensure robustness
    to changes in regime, including whipsaws.
