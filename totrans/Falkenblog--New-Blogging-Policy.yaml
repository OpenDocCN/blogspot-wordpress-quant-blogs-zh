    I'm now pretty ensconced in an interesting full time job working on quantitative
    issues related to equities and their options, but I know enough not to discuss
    it directly. I can't write much about what I work on most of the day, and my opportunity
    cost of blogging has made daily posting impractical.

    when I don't respond.
