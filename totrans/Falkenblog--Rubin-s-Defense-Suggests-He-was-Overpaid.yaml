    at Citi, I'm sure he's one of the better ones. But his

    these issues by the even less technical other board members?

    bought more and more residential mortgage backed CDOs during the housing bubble,
    about $54B worth of subprime-related securities on their balance sheet in September
    2007, which is especially risky considering their core business has about $300B
    in residential loans.

- en: Now, a $54B decision to purchase these securities is a conscious choice outside
    of a core business of the bank, which involves lending to home buyers via its
    branches. If this was outside of Rubin's scope, why did he pocket $115MM since
    1999 from Citi, excluding stock options? Why does one have to pay such vast sums
    to figureheads who by their own admission don't affect the company's balance sheet?
    Can I apply for such a job? I'll promise to be supportive, yet look pensive, during
    board meetings, and I will follow the 10/20/30 rule in my PowerPoint presentations
    (10 slides, 20 minutes, 30 point font). Most importantly, you need only pay me
    less than half, $50MM, for for all my non-effectual services.

    influencing regulation was worth it.
