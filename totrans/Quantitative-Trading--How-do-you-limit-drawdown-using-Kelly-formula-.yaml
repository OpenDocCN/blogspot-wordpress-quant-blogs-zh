    the probability of ruin. However, what Kelly formula wont' prevent is a deep drawdown,
    though we are assured that the drawdown won't be as much as 100%! This is unsatisfactory
    to many traders and especially fund managers, since a deep drawdown is psychologically
    painful and may cause you to panic and shut down a strategy prematurely.

- en: There is an easy way, though, that you can use Kelly formula to limit your drawdown
    to be much less than 100%. Suppose the optimal Kelly leverage of your strategy
    is determined to be K. And suppose you only allow a maximum drawdown (measured
    from the high watermark, as usual) to be D%. Then you can simply set aside D%
    of your initial total account equity for trading, and apply a leverage of K to
    this sub-account to determine your portfolio market value. The other 1-D% of the
    account will be sitting in cash. You can then be assured that you won't lose all
    of the equity of this sub-account, or equivalently, you won't suffer a drawdown
    of more than D% in your total account. If your trading strategy is profitable
    and the total account equity reaches a new high watermark, then you can reset
    your sub-account equity so that it is again D% of the total equity, moving some
    cash back to the "cash" account. Otherwise, you continue to keep the equity in
    the cash account separate from the equity of the trading sub-account.

    Indeed, some of you may be too nervous to use the full K as leverage, and prefer
    to use a leverage L smaller than K. (In fact, the common wisdom is that, due to
    estimation errors, it is never advisable to set L to be more than K/2,

    achieving maximum growth, the portfolio market value will be unresponsive to gains
    or losses and will remain relatively constant. Using the scheme I suggested above
    will cure this problem as well, because you can apply a higher leverage L_sub
    to the sub-account (e.g. use L_sub = L/D%) as long as L_sub < K, so that the portfolio
    market value is much more sensitive to your P&L while still ensuring the drawdown
    will not exceed D%.

    in hearing your experience and see if practice is as good as theory.
