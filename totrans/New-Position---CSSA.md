# New Position | CSSA

> 来源：[https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2012/09/20/new-position/#0001-01-01](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2012/09/20/new-position/#0001-01-01)

I recently joined a new firm- [Flexible Plan Investments](https://www.flexibleplan.com/public/home.aspx)– as the Vice President of Economic Research and Strategic Development. Flexible Plan was founded by Jerry Wagner, the co-founder of NAAIM and the creator of the [Wagner Award for Active Management](http://www.naaim.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/NAAIM-call-for-papers-13_draft1.pdf). Jerry is a pioneer in the industry for making absolute return strategies widely accessible to investment advisors in separately managed accounts. He has also been a major proponent of strategic diversification: combining a wide variety of uncorrelated strategies that are actively managed to achieve more stable returns across market cycles.  I am excited about the opportunity and  look forward to contributing on the research side. I will be more active on the blog going forward to share a lot of new ideas and directions for quantitative research.
