- en: Far from being a one-hit wonder, I [predicted](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/12/vix-and-more-and-2011-bespoke.html)
    just two weeks after it was launched (toward the end of 2010) that “TVIX will
    hit a tipping point and become the darling of day traders.” If anything, I am
    surprised that it took so long for TVIX to attract this much attention.

    not fully understand what factors are driving the price of TVIX. I have addressed
    some of these points over the course of the last week or so, but here are the
    four key drivers of the price of TVIX that every investor should understand:'

- en: '**Volatility** – this seems obvious, but in the short-term, the movements of
    the front month and second month [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures)
    explain almost all of the change in the price of TVIX. For day traders, TVIX becomes
    essentially a substitute for trading the VIX futures and with the exception of
    leverage, the other factors below are inconsequential.'

- en: '**Leverage** – another obvious factor, the 2x leverage in TVIX means that on
    average it moves about as quickly up and down in percentage terms as the VIX does
    and twice as quickly as a basket of front month and second month VIX futures.
    In the short-term, leverage means mostly that the moves in the underlying are
    exaggerated; in the long-term, leverage enhances volatility compounding and has
    a negative impact on price.'

- en: '**Contango** – thanks to the emergence of VIX ETPs as the cornerstone of volatility
    as an asset class, issues related to the VIX futures [term structure](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/term%20structure)
    in general and [contango](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/contango)
    and negative [roll yield](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/roll%20yield)
    in particular have become among the most frequently discussed issues in this space.
    Simply stated, the front month and second months of VIX futures are in contango
    more than 75% of the time, with the result being a *monthly* drag on TVIX’s price
    that exceeds the current *annual* yield on the 30-Year U.S. Treasury bond.'

- en: '**Volatility compounding** – the more volatility a leveraged security exhibits,
    the more that volatility will have a negative impact on performance over an extended
    period. The issue is the same as someone who owns a dress shop and marks the dress
    down 50% and then up 50% or reverses the chronology and marks the dress up 50%
    and then down 50%. Either way, the value of that dress declines by 25%. The same
    is true for leveraged ETPs and the degree of the price decay is a direct function
    of volatility.'

    as it can skirt the contango and volatility compounding issues in a compressed
    time frame. For buy and hold investors, however, contango plus volatility compounding
    is a recipe for big losses.

    who are long TVIX for extended periods will be subject to losses that are substantial
    and persistent, but there is always the chance of catching a brief move in which
    all four forces are aligned with the bulls and TVIX moves sharply higher, as was
    the case in August and September 2011\. Unfortunately, this is rarely the case.

    an investment in TVIX and do not fully understand each of the four issues above
    and their impact on investments in TVIX over the short-term and long-term time
    horizon, then it is probably time to stop trading and increase your knowledge
    base (hence the links below) before you learn some expensive lessons.
