- en: Well, the “HFT in my backyard’ series is a no-ending story, sellsally. By checking
    the Ofcom licences I realized a new competitor showed up **yesterday**. This new [licence](http://spectruminfo.ofcom.org.uk/spectrumInfo/licences?googloc=(51.15178610143037%2c+2.900390625)&unit=GHz&ne=(51.50874245880332%2c+3.4716796875)&service=Fixed+Links&code=301010&se=(50.792047064406866%2c+3.4716796875)&googoffset=39.6&nw=(51.50874245880332%2c+2.3291015625)&sw=(50.792047064406866%2c+2.3291015625)&groupKey=4&licenceNum=1027086&submit=Find%20licence)
    (1027086) was granted on February 18, 2015 to a Chicago firm named New Line Networks
    LLC. That’s interesting because this path (in the UK one Ofcom licence is for
    one path) goes from Manston (UK) to… the tall Houtem tower purchased by Jump Trading
    in Belgium – again, it’s about crossing the channel, and again it’s about Jump.

    a competitor to put dishes on this tower. The New Line Networks path, Houtem-Manston,
    is exactly the same as the Jump one. That’s interesting: the Houtem tower, which
    was the start of my investigation, seems to be a critical location now. Jump bought
    the tower for $5.000.000 in January 2013 in order to cross the channel by bypassing the
    Swingate towers where most of the other competitors are (that was a good move
    as with the Houtem tower they save some kilometers and given that the tower is
    really tall, they may have less problems with water reflection, etc.). What’s
    more, Jump resells bandwidth to Perseus and I know that one other competitor also
    leases the Jump microwave network to carry data between London and Frankfurt. That
    means a lot of HFT firms benefit from the Houtem tower now (Perseus’ clients,
    etc.). That could answer to one question I was wondering: why purchasing a tower
    for $5.000.000 since $5.000.000 is more or less the price you have to pay to build a
    whole microwave network between London and Frankfurt? Well, if Jump “leases” this
    tower (in different ways) to various HFT firms, the investment may be worth.'

    made public this [press release](http://news.kcg.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=105070&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=2016167)
    on February 12, 2015, a few days before the first New Line Networks licences appeared. “*KCG
    Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: KCG) announced today that its subsidiary, Geodesic Networks,
    LLC, and World Class Wireless, LLC have created a joint venture, New Line Networks
    LLC. New Line Networks will explore opportunities to leverage infrastructure investment,
    including re-selling network bandwidth to industry participants and third party
    vendors. Through this venture, New Line Networks will bring together complementary
    network and communication infrastructure while simultaneously providing additional
    data transmission bandwidth to the marketplace.*”'

    their best paths to create one most efficient/fastest network, and that’s intriguing.

    path through Manston is nearly a straight line…'

    a bulk of Ofcom licences to… [Communication Infrastructure UK](http://www.communicationinfrastructureltd.co.uk)
    (CIC) – a new surprise. I didn’t talk a lot about CIC before but the firm was
    one of the first to build a microwave network between New York and Chicago and
    after that they bought a lot of licences in France and in the UK. I didn’t talk
    about this network because it seems that CIC never installed dishes where they
    got licences (but I may be wrong). The more interesting is that CIC was purchased
    last year by Perseus – this public [data](https://www.aihitdata.com/company/01260007/COMMUNICATION-INFRASTRUCTURE-UK-LIMITED/history#main) tells
    us that that on March 3, 2014, Mr. Jock Percy was appointed as an executive of
    CIC, and Mr. Percy is the Perseus CEO. (One amazing detail: CIC had an Ofcom licence
    in Houtem **before** the tower was bought by Jump Trading). So… KCG bought the
    Latent licences, which are now a part of New Line Networks, and Perseus, who resells
    the Jump bandwidth, sold their CIC licences to New Line Networks, partially owned
    by Jump (hard to follow, isn’t it?). Here is the map of the old CIC paths now
    owned by New Line Networks:'

    for the same towers/paths. But we can see that the new firm bought the old Houtem-Manston
    path (meaning they have several licences in Houtem now) and another path to cross
    the Channel, from Calais (France) to Swingate (UK) – probably to go to Slough.
    What’s more, they also bought some licences involving towers needed to go to Cornwall,
    where the microwave networks meet the transatlantic cables to go to New Jersey
    and then to Chicago – after all, both Jump and KCG are Chicago firms. (By the
    way: the fact New Line bought licences to go to Cornwall may confirm that the
    new Hibernia cable, Project Express, whose landing station is not in Cornwall,
    may not be available to the HFT microwave competitors – at least for now).'

    who visit this blog know what is going on here. Two of the major (and historical)
    HFT firms from Chicago are working together to build a super-microwave network
    in Europe, joining their towers/licences and reselling all the stuff to customers
    who will always be slower than them. The KCG press release says that New Line
    will resell “*network bandwidth to industry participants and third party vendors… while
    simultaneously providing additional data transmission bandwidth to the marketplace*”.
    This is like a message. That means the McKay Brothers network, providing data
    for the parent company Quincy Data, may face a new and strong competitor. “HFT”
    is hard.

    we would have to add all the Getco/Global Colocation Services licences and above
    all the hundreds of Jump licences. All of that may give rise to a new mega-microwave
    network in Europe. There is a lot to say here – I think we can learn a lot from
    this new project. I’ll speculate on that in the very last part of this series,
