    different ways for signs of green shoots, brown shoots, bottoming, rebounding
    and backsliding. To make matters worse, there are headline numbers, data subsets
    which are ex-this and ex-that, month-over-month comparisons, year-over-year comparisons,
    and comparisons relative to consensus estimates – and depending on who you are
    listening to, there can even be multiple ‘consensus’ numbers.

    quick to distill each piece of new economic data into some essential graphics.
    Some of the best of these, like [Calculated Risk](http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/),
    [The Big Picture](http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/), etc. are widely known. Other
    blogs that rip apart the data and repackage the highlights graphically should
    probably be better know. Included among this group is [EconomPicData](http://econompicdata.blogspot.com/),
    which is responsible for the chart below.

    to get excited about the magnitude of improvement.
