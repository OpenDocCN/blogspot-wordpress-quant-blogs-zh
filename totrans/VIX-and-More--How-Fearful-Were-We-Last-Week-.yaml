    it be to have a bunch of VIX data lying around if you didn’t have an opportunity
    to force it to play

- en: So…with those two thoughts placed firmly tongue in cheek, I set out to find
    yet another way to show just how fearful the markets were – or were not – this
    past week. This time around I have plotted a diagonal black line that represents
    a best fit of all VIX and SPX daily changes since 1990\. Above and to the right
    of that line represents more fear per unit move in the SPX; below and to the left
    of that line represents more complacency per unit move in the SPX. The blue diamonds
    are the end of day plots for the changes in the VIX and SPX for last week

  zh: 所以……带着这两点想法，我再次出发，寻找另一种方式来展示市场过去一周是多么的恐慌——或者不是。这次，我绘制了一条代表所有VIX和SPX日常变化自1990年以来最佳拟合的斜线。在那天线上方且右侧代表SPX单位移动更多的恐惧；在那天线下方且左侧代表SPX单位移动更多的自满。上周末的蓝色钻石是VIX和SPX变化的日终图。
- en: A look at the graph shows a notable lack of fear from Monday through Thursday,
    with Friday’s market selloff generating a spike in the VIX that was out of proportion
    to a typical VIX move for a -2.56% drop in the SPX. Going forward, I will keep
    track of how much time the SPX-VIX relationship spends on the fear side of the
    best fit line and the magnitude of that divergence. Today, for instance, we are
    back on the complacency side of the line with the Dow down 91 points and the SPX
    off 8.5 points.

  zh: 图表的观察显示，从周一到周四市场明显缺乏恐慌情绪，而周五的市场抛售导致VIX的飙升与SPX通常的VIX变动不成比例。例如，今天，我们又回到了自满的一侧，道琼斯工业平均指数下跌91点，标普500指数下跌8.5点。
