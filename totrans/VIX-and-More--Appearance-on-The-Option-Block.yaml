- en: Yesterday I made a guest appearance on [The Option Block](http://www.theoptionsinsider.com/radio/?id=137),
    an [Options Insider Radio](http://www.theoptionsinsider.com/radio/) program hosted
    by Mark Longo of [The Options Insider](http://www.theoptionsinsider.com/). We
    talk a little bit about the history of the *VIX and More* blog, the VIX as a market
    timing indicator, the VIX as a hedging tool, [VIX options](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20options),
    [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures), [VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX),
    [VXZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXZ) and some related subjects.
