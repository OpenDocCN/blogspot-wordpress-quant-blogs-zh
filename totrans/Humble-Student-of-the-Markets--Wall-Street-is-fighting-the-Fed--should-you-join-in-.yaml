    Federal Reserve is nowhere close to ending its campaign of rate increases. While last

    market expectations. In the aftermath of the FOMC meeting and press conference,
    Fed Funds expectations barely budged. The terminal rate stayed the same at just
    under 5%, though the expected path of rate cuts was pushed out by a month from
    the September to the November meeting.
