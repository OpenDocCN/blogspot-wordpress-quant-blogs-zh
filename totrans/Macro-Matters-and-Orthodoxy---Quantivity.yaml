    as it was largely a waste of time: fancy theory lacking compelling evidence, amplified
    by no consensus within the field à la [saltwater versus freshwater](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saltwater_and_freshwater_economics).'

    the [great moderation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Moderation). In fact,
    traders took apparent pride in their ignorance of macro—except the [global macro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_macro)
    guys, obviously. Then, along came a credit crisis.

    macro perspective: a “top down” complement to calibrate “bottom up” quant models.
    Quantivity brought great humility to this effort, due to both intrinsic complexity
    and comparatively weaker background in macro.'

    addition alongside micro analysis. Two caveats are worth noting. First, confirmation
    bias is particularly dangerous with macro, and thus emphasis is placed on broadly
    considering diverse viewpoints. Second, these thoughts are posted with a bit of
    trepidation, given intense desire to avoid politics and policymaking.

    not a topic many folks enjoy reading at bedtime. Much more empirically challenging
    is the statistical rarity of credit crises; only twice in the past century: globally
    1927 – 1934 and in Japan 1989 – 2005.'

    climate, including *credit crisis*, *balance sheet recession*, and *liquidity
    trap*. Rajan presents a shockingly prescient perspective on the impact and dangers
    caused by financial development, equally applicable today as in 2005.

    make this call in *real-time* based on incomplete information, simultaneously
    understanding all three in sufficient confidence to risk capital.'

    for macro data. Given data, next is building intuition and understanding of dogmatic
    applicability via analysis and synthesis while seeking to minimize confirmation
    bias.
