    indicating that 2013 ended on a positive note. Second-half growth in real GDP
    — our broadest measure of overall economic activity — was stronger than we've
    seen in quite some time. ***While that figure was boosted significantly by inventory
    accumulation that is unlikely to persist***, there was some evidence of momentum
    that might carry forward.

    Movements in 10-year Treasury notes are telling the same story. Last summer, 10-year
    yields were rising because investors saw a tighter Fed. Now they’re falling. Investors
    seem to be reading a string of soft economic data – weaker car sales, a manufacturing
    slowdown, disappointing job growth – and concluding the economic coast is not
    as clear as it appeared just a few weeks ago.

    too easy. Indeed, we would hope that they would only be tapering in the context
    of a rising interest rate environment as it would suggest that market participants
    were anticipating higher growth and inflation. But the Fed doesn't see it that
    way. They see lower rates as a signal that policy is easier. And hence are not
    inclined to react to ease policy further by stopping the taper.

    be good news for emerging market investors as well, because tapering would be
    replaced by other forms of accommodation. When will Mr. Market take the view that
    an easier Fed is good news (as long as the economy doesn't keel over into recession)?
