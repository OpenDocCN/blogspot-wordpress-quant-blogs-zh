- en: Life is so much easier since Microsoft took over the MSDN Magazine and start
    publishing it on the web – I can access back issues easily, and I don’t have to
    wait for the slow airmail to reach London. This month’s magazine has a number
    of excellent articles. For a start there is [Matt Pietrek](http://blogs.msdn.com/matt_pietrek/)
    [X64 Primer](http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/06/05/x64/) – Matt always
    writes cool articles that allow software engineers to expand there knowledge of
    Windows development irrespective of how many years they’ve been developing software.
    Stephen Toub has a good article on [MDA’s](http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/06/05/BugBash/)
    – I can only hope that as per Stephen’s last paragraph, custom MDA’s will be supported
    in CLR 3.0\. I could be wrong, but I don’t think I’ve seen an MSDN magazine article
    from [Lutz Roeder](http://aisto.com/roeder/frontier/) – pretty sure if Lutz wrote
    one, it would be worth a read.
