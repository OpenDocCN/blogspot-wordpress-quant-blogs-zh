- en: banks should provide incentives that reward sales reps for shifting uneconomical
    trades and clients from voice to e-trading channels. Motivating the right sales
    behavior will free reps to deliver more valuable services, such as exploring the
    needs of clients, generating trading ideas, providing market commentary (or “color”),
    and offering counsel on complex trades. However, banks will need to attract, cultivate,
    and retain a new breed of sales talent, with the skills to meet the demands of
    a new era far removed from the old one, in which dealer inventory largely drove
    the sales function.
