    today – unless of course it’s [WM](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=wm).  With
    anxiety over [ABK](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=abk) and [MBI](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=mbi)
    seemingly on the back burner at the moment and [TMA](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=tma)
    and [LEH](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=leh) suddenly so yesterday, which
    financial stock is going to set the tone for the market?  My take is that since
    one tipping domino is unlikely to be contained, I am continuing to focus on the
    broad sector ETF, [XLF](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=xlf).

    of XLF showing price and implied volatility; in the interim, a great deal has
    changed, with the bears and the news flow dictating the action.  From a technical
    standpoint, just yesterday XLF took out the 52 week high (47.99) in implied volatility
    from November 8^(th) and the 52 week stock price low (24.11) from January 22^(nd).  The
    chart below zooms in on the last six months and shows that yesterday’s selloff
    generated a new stock price low of 23.50 and IV high of 54.52 – a fitting tribute
    to the eight year anniversary of the NASDAQ all-time high.

    the other financial headline makers, but XLF is an excellent proxy for the sector
    and a good way to keep focused on the forest instead of the trees.  Note also
    the action in the [XLF calls](http://www.888options.com/institutional/market/calls.jsp)
    for March, April and June, which shows some significant bets are being made that
    today’s XLF-led market bounce will not be a one day affair.  No matter how things
    play out, XLF should be an excellent tell.  I suggest you watch it as closely
    as you do the broader indices and keep an eye not just on the price, but also
    on the IV and put to call activity.
