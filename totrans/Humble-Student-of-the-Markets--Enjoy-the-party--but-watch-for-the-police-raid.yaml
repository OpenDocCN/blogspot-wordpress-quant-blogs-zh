    AQR would therefore set the stage for the announcement of some form of QE at the
    November ECB meeting. As it turned out, no major French or German bank failed
    the AQR and the problems banks that hadn`t addressed their balance sheet problems
    were relatively small and were concentrated in peripheral eurozone countries.

- en: Starting with the Ukrainian election, a victory for President Poroshenko’s moderate
    party should allow EU leaders to launch a genuine peace process that recognises
    the loss of Crimea as irreversible and acknowledges Russia’s vital interests in
    maintaining the military neutrality of its immediate neighbours. Once these basic
    conditions are satisfied, a rapprochement with Russia should become possible,
    allowing sanctions to be gradually dismantled or at least confirming that sanctions
    will expire by mid-2015, as currently legislated. Removing the threat of war or
    further sanctions in eastern Europe will have a major beneficial effect on businesses
    in Germany and Italy, which been hurt much more by the confrontation with Russia
    than European leaders expected.
