    trend and 2) countertrend. To be consistently successful, you have to be able
    to do both because both strategies have a notorious habit of going in and out
    of favor in an unpredictable and sudden manner.  We have examined numerous countertrend
    systems, and given the strong market rally  i think it is worthwhile taking a
    better look at trend systems. I have not had the time to test this idea yet, but
    i strongly believe that it will work well.'

    by Chuck LeBeau. But there are a few  differences:'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 1) ***it has a trigger***:  The entry is triggered by a new “n”-day high or
    low with a lookback of “k” days. That is, the stock or ETF has made a new 100-day
    high, and no new 100-day highs were achieved within a lookback of 20 days. My
    recommendations are for default n/k settings of  25/10, 50/15,  100/20 and 252/40\.
    This prevents whipsaws once the stop is triggered because re-entry is not permitted
    unless it newly satisfies either the long or short conditions.

- en: 2) ***it has an intial stop:*** this is suggested to be 1/2 the trailing stop.
    The default settings could be 2xATR (average true range) and 4x ATR. The trailing
    stop is triggered when the stock rises (or falls in the case of shorts) an amount
    equal to the intial stop. Thus if the stock goes up 2 ATR, the trailing stop is
    triggered, ensuring a maximum loss equal to the initial stop.

- en: '3) ***it has a variable trailing stop:*** Here is where it gets interesting–
    as the trend gets stronger, the stop gets tighter. Most of us (including myself) have
    experienced the pain of watching unrealized gains evaporate after a stock goes
    parabolic. Moving averages and other trailing stops cannot protect you from this
    because they do not adjust rapidly enough. Therefore i propose the following adjustment
    using a default 4xATR trailing stop:'

    this case) below the current level***'

- en: '***for shorts: DVT Trailing stop= (1-((1-RSI14)/100 or DVS reading)) x 2 x
    default ATR(4 in this case) above the current level***'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As a general preference i would choose the DVS (the stretch indicator) over
    the RSI14\. But to keep it simple if the RSI 14 is 70 then the DVT would be:    (1-
    70/100) x 2 x4= 2.4  So as the security gets stronger, the stop gets tighter—-theoretically
    preserving your gains more effectively.

    every day but could never decrease, and if you were short, it could never increase.
    As a final suggestion, i believe that the following settings are appropriate for
    various instruments:'

    20 day lookback. 4 ATR as a trailing stop, 2 ATR as an initial stop.'
