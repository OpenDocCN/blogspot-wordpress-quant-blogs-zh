- en: As this week is somewhat of a vacation for me, I had a rare day where I missed
    about 95% of the trading action and am only now checking the patient’s vital signs.
    On a down day like today, I expect to see some more bullish bias creep into some
    of my contrarian sentiment indicators; much to my surprise, today things actually
    look worse for the bulls in that regard.

- en: Now that it has been [more than two months](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/05/three-pivotal-sectors-financials.html)
    since I posted the chart below, I thought this evening might be a good time to
    update the three [sectors](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/sectors)
    I have been watching most closely since the March bottom. These '[indicator species](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/indicator%20species)'
    sectors are the financials ([XLF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLF)),
    homebuilders ([XHB](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XHB)), and consumer
    discretionary ([XLY](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLY)) stocks.  As
    the chart shows, the financials and homebuilders recently moved above their 50
    day simple moving average, only to fall sharply below that important technical
    level over the course of the past three days.

    I am likely to be skeptical of anything that has the appearance of a rally.
