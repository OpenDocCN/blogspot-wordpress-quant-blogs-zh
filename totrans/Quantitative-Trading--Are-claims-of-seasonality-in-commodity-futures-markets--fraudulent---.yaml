    normally go around challenging claims made by the United States government. But
    if this statement, which is basically the efficient market hypothesis, is generally
    true, then all of us traders should just pack up and go home. Now whether or not

    is it right for the government to state definitively that this hypothesis is true,
    and that all claims otherwise are "fraudulent"?
