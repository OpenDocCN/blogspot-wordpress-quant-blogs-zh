    Norway, Sweden and New Zealand. For several years following the global financial
    crisis, these five countries all shared a common theme—a multi-year housing boom,

    reversed course, be it slowing appreciation or outright decline. Moreover, this

    not occur given the otherwise strong economic growth backdrop in these countries.
    But we take a long-term view of house prices, and began highlighting affordability
    problems in these markets several years ago.
