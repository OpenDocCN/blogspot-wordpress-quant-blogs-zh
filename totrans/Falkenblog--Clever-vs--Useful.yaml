    MIT.

- en: went through a presentation to a full set of finance faculty, and at the end,
    asked if there were any questions. There were none. I thought, boy, this guy bombed.
    How wrong I was. He was the top guy on the market that year, having solved a complicated
    problem involving comparing individuals with different utility functions. Previously
    it was thought you could only explain the heterogeneity by having different coefficients
    in their functional form, but this guy compared a consumer/investor with a square
    root utility, to that of a consumer with logarithmic utility. I failed to see
    the significance, but then I realized that professors love this kind of thing.
    It was difficult math, and he derived a closed form solution!

    results are possible. He then asks how the results are qualitatively different
    from an economy with a CRRA representative agent.

    interesting differences found, or they would have been mentioned. I would call
    that a dead end. He just got a closed form, and everyone clapped. It reminds me
    of articles that show 'a rich class of models', as if interesting applications
    are left as an exercise for the reader.
