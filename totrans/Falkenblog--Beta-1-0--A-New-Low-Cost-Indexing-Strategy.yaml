    lower returns for highly volatile assets of all forms. In practice it's worse
    than raw data show, because highly volatile assets tend to have higher transaction
    costs because they are often less liquid, having a higher bid-ask spread and move
    more when you try to position into them.

    the high-flyers that have very poor returns, and they lower risk: win-win in return-volatility

    be sophisticated enough to see that the Sharpe ratio is the best metric for a
    broadly diversified equity portfolio.'

    such as any deviation from a benchmark such as the S&P500\. Around the year 2000
    I was trying to pitch a low volatility strategy, and running a small fund with
    my own money as a sideline to my day job as a quant and risk manager. I remember
    many saying to me that it all seemed fine, but it would have underperformed over
    the prior year, and no one wants to put money into a strategy that underpeformed
    recently. I thought it was irrational, but given the way money flows into funds--via
    relative performance--it was rational given their constraints. Alas, it did very
    well over the next two years. The key is, when you play the averages, using decades
    of data, you can't really market time as well; not everything has momentum.

    that like many people with a good new idea, my problem is not people stealing
    it, rather, shoving it down their throats. The idea that 'the CAPM' does not work,
    is pretty well established. Even the fact that higher volatility stocks underperform
    is now pretty universally acknowledged. The implication is therefore obvious (though

    that lower volatility stocks had higher returns than high volatility stocks, they
    figured I just made an error, and hoped I would disappear. My finding couldn't
    be true because rational investors should not allow it, 'the market' should have
    a dominant Sharpe ratio, and I did not identify it via generalized method of moments
    or Banach spaces. Just control for price, or size, and sort, and there it was.

    never 'risk adjusted' in any way. Someone who merely outperformed the S&P500 by
    2% a year, but never made the top 10% in any year, would probably lose his job
    the first year he underperformed, because he would never have one of those years

    this leads to benchmarking, and leads to an elimination of the risk premium. Add
    to this that there's a 'hope premium' in highly volatile assets, and high volatility
    stocks are basically suboptimal within a long-only portfolio.
