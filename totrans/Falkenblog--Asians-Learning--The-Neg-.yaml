- en: I recall one of the strangest conversations I had in the city. A woman came
    up to me at a party and said she had been moved by a piece of writing I had published.
    She confessed that prior to reading it, she had never wanted to talk to me, and
    had always been sure, on the basis of what she could see from across the room,
    that I was nobody worth talking to, that I was in fact someone to avoid.

    I was a person with great reserves of feeling and insight. She did not ask my
    forgiveness for this brutal misjudgment. Instead, what she wanted to know was—why
    had I kept that person she had glimpsed in my essay so well hidden? She confessed
    something of her own hidden sorrow: She had never been beautiful and had decided,
    early on, that it therefore fell to her to “love the world twice as hard.” Why
    hadn’t I done that?'

    he had needed to be more obstreperous I find rather interesting. Is it simply
    prudent to be less considerate of others? Is appearing aloof and disrespectful
    of others a smart tactic to make you more more powerful, more financially successful?

- en: The neg seems most likely to work on insecure, below-excellent, targets, which
    might be sufficient for a young man looking for sex, but not necessarily a good
    life strategy. Then again, most people meet their spouses in inauspicious scenarios,
    and just this weekend I learned of a woman whose first date with her now husband
    involved him getting into an almost fight with another man--clearly this display
    was impressive.

  zh: 看起来，否定似乎最有可能对那些不安全、不太出色的目标起作用，这对于一个寻找性的年轻人来说可能足够了，但不一定是一个好的生活策略。再说了，大多数人在不吉利的场景中遇到他们的配偶，就在这个周末，我听说了一个女人与她现在的丈夫的第一次约会涉及到他与另一个男人几乎打架——显然这种表现很令人印象深刻。
- en: But as for the woman taking her lack of beauty as a reason to love the world
    twice as much, I'm skeptical this is the optimal response. Rather, I think she
    should simply accept that unlike the Halle Barrys of the world, not everyone will
    appreciate her attractiveness, and not be discouraged by it. It seems a very Biblical
    assertion that the more you suffer the more you love the Creator who allows such
    suffering. Anyway, I like that the woman had a strategy that tried to compensate
    for her realistic constraints, but I think except in extreme circumstances, a
    person is never objectively ugly, but rather, merely not beautiful.

  zh: 但对于那个将自己缺乏美貌视为爱这个世界的理由的女人，我对这是否是最佳反应表示怀疑。相反，我认为她应该简单地接受，与世界上的哈莉·贝瑞（Halle Barry）不同，不是每个人都会欣赏她的吸引力，不因此而灰心丧气。这似乎是一个非常圣经式的断言，即你受苦越多，就会越爱那位允许这种苦难的造物主。无论如何，我喜欢那个女人有一个试图弥补她现实约束的策略，但我认为除非在极端情况下，一个人从来都不是客观丑陋的，而只是没有美丽而已。
- en: Most of us, including me, aren't beautiful like models and movie stars. We are
    a totality, usually sufficiently attractive to make our objective appearance irrelevant
    to whether a worthy evaluator considers us beautiful irrespective of our thoughts,
    behaviors, and manners. I think if my daughter becomes an 'unattractive' woman,
    I will still think of her as beautiful because I appreciate her essence. Her optimal
    strategy should not be to love more, but rather, be as attractive as possible--maximize
    her potential as a person--and find people who appreciate her.

  zh: 我们大多数人，包括我在内，不像模特和电影明星一样美丽。我们是一个整体，通常足够吸引人，使我们的客观外貌对于是否一个有价值的评估者认为我们美丽与否是无关的，无论我们的思想、行为和举止如何。我认为如果我的女儿成为一个“不吸引人”的女人，我仍然会认为她是美丽的，因为我欣赏她的本质。她的最佳策略不应该是更多地去爱，而是尽可能地有吸引力——尽可能地发挥她作为一个人的潜力——并找到欣赏她的人。
