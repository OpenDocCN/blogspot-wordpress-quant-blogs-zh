    up to me at a party and said she had been moved by a piece of writing I had published.
    She confessed that prior to reading it, she had never wanted to talk to me, and
    had always been sure, on the basis of what she could see from across the room,
    that I was nobody worth talking to, that I was in fact someone to avoid.

    I was a person with great reserves of feeling and insight. She did not ask my
    forgiveness for this brutal misjudgment. Instead, what she wanted to know was—why
    had I kept that person she had glimpsed in my essay so well hidden? She confessed
    something of her own hidden sorrow: She had never been beautiful and had decided,
    early on, that it therefore fell to her to “love the world twice as hard.” Why
    hadn’t I done that?'

    and giving paid advice on the tactic. The idea of a smart young man discovering
    he had needed to be more obstreperous I find rather interesting. Is it simply
    prudent to be less considerate of others? Is appearing aloof and disrespectful
    of others a smart tactic to make you more more powerful, more financially successful?
    This concept has been popularized in

    might be sufficient for a young man looking for sex, but not necessarily a good
    life strategy. Then again, most people meet their spouses in inauspicious scenarios,
    and just this weekend I learned of a woman whose first date with her now husband
    involved him getting into an almost fight with another man--clearly this display
    was impressive.

    twice as much, I'm skeptical this is the optimal response. Rather, I think she
    should simply accept that unlike the Halle Barrys of the world, not everyone will
    appreciate her attractiveness, and not be discouraged by it. It seems a very Biblical
    assertion that the more you suffer the more you love the Creator who allows such
    suffering. Anyway, I like that the woman had a strategy that tried to compensate
    for her realistic constraints, but I think except in extreme circumstances, a
    person is never objectively ugly, but rather, merely not beautiful.

    a totality, usually sufficiently attractive to make our objective appearance irrelevant
    to whether a worthy evaluator considers us beautiful irrespective of our thoughts,
    behaviors, and manners. I think if my daughter becomes an 'unattractive' woman,
    I will still think of her as beautiful because I appreciate her essence. Her optimal
    strategy should not be to love more, but rather, be as attractive as possible--maximize
    her potential as a person--and find people who appreciate her.
