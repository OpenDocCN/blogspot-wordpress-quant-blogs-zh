- en: As action in the [TVIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TVIX) heats
    up again today (up 15% on 21 million shares traded), I gave some thought to who
    might be trading what I called in this space over a year ago “day trading rocket
    fuel.”

- en: In the graphic below, it appears that TVIX is part of the arsenal of those who
    favor the high volatility products that are ideally suited to short-term trades.
    These include the [3x leveraged ETPs](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/triple%20ETFs)
    ([TNA](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TNA) and [TZA](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TZA)),
    the 2x leveraged ETP for silver ([AGQ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/AGQ))
    and a handful of futures products based on the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average
    and [crude oil](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/crude%20oil). Two
    high flying stocks are also on the list, Renren ([RENN](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/RENN))
    and BroadVision ([BVSN](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/BVSN)) – the
    latter of which just happens to be the first or second internet stock I ever purchased,
    some 16 years ago.

    typing this, there appeared to be another short squeeze in TVIX (see [VXX Options
    Calm After Second Highest Volume Day Ever](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2012/02/vxx-options-calm-after-second-highest.html)
    for details on the last one), though the markets seem to be settling back down
    once again.

- en: Finally, a quick reminder that today is the last trading day for VIX February
    options. VIX February futures can be traded through tomorrow’s pre-market session,
    which runs from 8:00 – 9:15 a.m. ET. Both products settle with a special opening
    quotation ([VIX SOQ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20SOQ)) at
    the beginning of tomorrow’s regular trading session.
