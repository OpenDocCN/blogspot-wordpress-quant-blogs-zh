- en: Last Wednesday, the NASDAQ-100 index ([NDX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/NDX)),
    which had been relatively weak compared to the SPX, put in a top and began to
    decline. The weakness in the NDX was one of the reasons I wondered aloud [SPX
    915 As a Top?](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/05/spx-915-as-top.html) – only
    to discover that while I had indeed found a top, it was in the NDX, not in the
    S&P 500.

  zh: 上周三，纳斯达克100指数（[NDX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/NDX)）相对于标普500指数表现较弱，触及高点并开始下跌。NDX的弱势是我公开质疑[SPX
    915 是否已到顶？](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/05/spx-915-as-top.html)的原因之一——结果发现我确实找到了一个顶部，但这个顶部在NDX，而不是标普500。
- en: On Thursday, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, also known as the [SOX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SOX),
    put in a top of its own before reversing hard and declining precipitously. The
    SOX ended the day down 5.6% and dragged down the NDX and the rest of the technology
    sector with it. Technology has been in a tailspin ever since the steep drop in
    the SOX.

  zh: 周四，费城半导体指数（也称[SOX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SOX)）在触及自身高点后逆转并急剧下跌。SOX当日收盘下跌5.6%，并拖累了NDX和整个科技板块。自SOX大幅下跌以来，科技股一直处于下滑状态。
- en: The banks were successful in keeping the broader markets in a bullish mode on
    Friday without the help of the SOX and technology (see [The Banks vs. Technology](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/05/banks-vs-technology.html)),
    but starting on Monday, the weakness in technology began to spread to other sectors,
    even the financials.

  zh: 银行在上周五成功地将市场保持在大牛市状态，没有SOX和科技股的帮助（参见[银行对比科技](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/05/banks-vs-technology.html)），但自周一以来，科技股的弱势开始蔓延到其他板块，甚至是金融股。
- en: The SOX has long been considered a leading indicator, not just for technology
    firms but also for the market in general. Semiconductors are early cycle technology
    stocks and an unhealthy semiconductor sector does not bode well for economic recovery.

  zh: 科技股的SOX指数长期以来被认为是领先指标，不仅对科技股，对整个市场也是如此。半导体股是早期周期的科技股，一个不健康的半导体行业对经济复苏并不利。
- en: Going forward, a healthy rally should include the participation of semiconductors,
    as measured by the SOX and ETFs such as [SMH](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SMH).
    In an ideal rally, semiconductors should show strong absolute gains and also outperform
    the SPX on a relative basis. Until we see more strength from semiconductors, I
    am likely to have a bearish bias.

  zh: 展望未来，健康的反弹应该包括半导体的参与，如SOX和ETF如[SMH](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SMH)所衡量。在理想的反弹中，半导体应显示出强劲的绝对收益，并在相对基础上超越标普500。除非我们看到半导体有更多的强势表现，否则我可能会有看跌倾向。
