- en: Last Wednesday, the NASDAQ-100 index ([NDX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/NDX)),
    which had been relatively weak compared to the SPX, put in a top and began to
    decline. The weakness in the NDX was one of the reasons I wondered aloud [SPX
    915 As a Top?](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/05/spx-915-as-top.html) – only
    to discover that while I had indeed found a top, it was in the NDX, not in the
    S&P 500.

    put in a top of its own before reversing hard and declining precipitously. The
    SOX ended the day down 5.6% and dragged down the NDX and the rest of the technology
    sector with it. Technology has been in a tailspin ever since the steep drop in
    the SOX.

    Friday without the help of the SOX and technology (see [The Banks vs. Technology](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/05/banks-vs-technology.html)),
    but starting on Monday, the weakness in technology began to spread to other sectors,
    even the financials.

    firms but also for the market in general. Semiconductors are early cycle technology
    stocks and an unhealthy semiconductor sector does not bode well for economic recovery.

- en: Going forward, a healthy rally should include the participation of semiconductors,
    as measured by the SOX and ETFs such as [SMH](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SMH).
    In an ideal rally, semiconductors should show strong absolute gains and also outperform
    the SPX on a relative basis. Until we see more strength from semiconductors, I
    am likely to have a bearish bias.
