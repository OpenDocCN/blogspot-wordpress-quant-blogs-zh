- en: Just a quick note to let those who are interested know that the [subscriber
    newsletter](http://vixandmoresubscriber.blogspot.com/) has received considerable
    reader feedback and made a number of changes in October. Perhaps the biggest change
    is to expand the scope of the newsletter (which already had a broader reach than
    this blog) to focus more on macroeconomic and fundamental issues, provide a stronger
    global perspective, and make an effort to highlight more high potential stocks
    and ETFs.

    the newsletter content each month and provides updates on several model portfolios
    the newsletter tracks, including a Stock of the Week selection that has a cumulative
    gain of 90% since the newsletter was launched on March 30, 2008.
