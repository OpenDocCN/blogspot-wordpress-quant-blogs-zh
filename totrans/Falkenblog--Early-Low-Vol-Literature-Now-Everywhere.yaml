    from confidentiality agreement that my old boss was using to keep me from starting
    a new low-vol fund.  It was easy for me to deflect the 'mean variance optimization'
    allegation by pointing to Nobel Prize winning research even a judge could apprehend,
    but the low volatility angle was a lot harder to prove, at least by the time I
    would run out of money. Not only was I too soon pitching this strategy on Wall

    would have made my life easier.  Yet, I think it's misleading to say low volatility
    investing was 'out there' in 1975 (Haugen and Heins).  As someone who worked every
    day on the issue of precedence for over a year, I can tell you it was hardly common
    knowledge or obvious that these early works implied low vol investing was a good
    idea, and so instead I was emphasizing my prior use (eg, my

      With hindsight, these findings obviously implied the superiority of low volatility
    investing, because they imply you get the same return for less volatility/beta.

    (1975), or Haugen and Baker (1991) forgets that this was just part of all those
    CAPM rejection pieces, which until 1992 everyone thought meant something quite
    different (swamped by value, size, or methodological issues).  Certainly not that
    low vol investing is attractive, which  to my knowledge was not mentioned until
