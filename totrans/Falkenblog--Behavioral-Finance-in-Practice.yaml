    anecdotally in the past. For example, the 3Com-Palm spinoff was an arbitrage,
    and I personally know people who arbitraged it. But it does not happen often enough
    to be interesting. The predictability of the aggregate dividend price ratio uses
    a 4 year horizon, so how many 4 year horizons do we have in the US? About 20 (80
    years divided by 4). That's hardly enough to draw strong conclusions. The index-add/delete
    strategy was over years ago. Is it really that strange to note that there are
    many ways to make money if you could go backtward in time?

    'overreaction' effect, even though these are contradictory. Further, no one has
    updated their 3 year mean reversion result. If you think contradictory empirical
    results are true, and no one publishes 3 year mean reversion follow-ups, chances
    are you did make a technical mistake (in their case, rebalancing daily returns
    for low-price stocks).

    I don't see how behavioral economics helps you exploit this. But my bottom line
    is that the rational market school tells you to be skeptical, to check things
    again and again. Behavioralism lends itself to seeing too many anomalies that
    are not, or no longer, there. The batting average of someone jumping into these
    strategies would be less than 50%. Many have a short time frame, so one taking
    advantage would have to be a full time short term trader to capture these, and
    you would have been let go long ago if these were pillars of your strategy.

    people to formalize this approach. Above is a utility graph from Harry Markowitz
    back in a 1952 JPE article, who was commenting on Milton Friedman and Savage''s
    analysis in this same vein. It has the essence of prospect theory: risk loving
    for losses, risk aversion for gains, for some arbitrary wealth point. The profession
    dropped this thread because it was too rich: allowing people to be risk averse
    or loving, ignoring or overweighting small probability events, is not a useful
    insight. I don''t know how many times I hear intellectual dilettantes note how
    Khaneman''s work is really exciting, which is odd given how old the double inflected
    utility function is. 50 years is a long time; it was not discovered when Kahneman
    won the Nobel prize in 2002.'
