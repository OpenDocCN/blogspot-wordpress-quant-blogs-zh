    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    can be characterized in a number of ways. Technicians would call my approach inter-market
    analysis. Fundamentally driven investors may regard me as a global macro or cross-asset
    analyst. That`s because all markets are inter-connected and to simply focus at
    any single stock, sector or market in isolation misses the big picture. Analyzing
    different components of the big picture also allows me to write about topics as
    diverse as the US equity market, the term structure of the VIX Index (see

    holds the key to the medium term outlook (6-12 months) for US equities. As the
    chart below shows, the Trade Weighted Dollar has seen a clear breach of an uptrend
    line, which has bullish implications for equity bulls.
