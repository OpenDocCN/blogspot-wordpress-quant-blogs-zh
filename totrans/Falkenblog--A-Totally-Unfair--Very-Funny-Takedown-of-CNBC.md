# Falkenblog: A Totally Unfair, Very Funny Takedown of CNBC

> 来源：[http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2009/03/totally-unfair-very-funny-takedown-of.html#0001-01-01](http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2009/03/totally-unfair-very-funny-takedown-of.html#0001-01-01)

That was unfair, because Stewart said Santinelli was on Wall Street, but he was in Chicago.

What was unfair? Santelli is a GOOPER shill who said not one word when Hankie Paulson turned over the keys to the U. S. Treasury to the likes of John Thain and Ken Lewis.

Santelli, Coulter, Limbaugh are GOOPER apologists who care not a whit about the truth.

For one, David Faber never said Merrill Lynch was going down. He said ML said ML was not going down.
