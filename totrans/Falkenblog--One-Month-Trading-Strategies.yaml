    does not significantly overlap with standard quant factors like ‘value’ because
    they involve different databases: minute or even tick data, level 2 quotes. They
    are less scalable and involve more trading, making them more the province of hedge
    funds than large institutional funds. Alternatively, super-short-term patterns
    can be subsumed within the tactics of an execution desk, where any alpha would
    be reflected in lower transaction costs.'

    that underlay the profitable ‘pairs-trading’ strategy that flourished in the 1990s.
    [Lo and Mackinlay](https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article-abstract/1/1/41/1601244)
    also noted this pattern in 1988, though their focus was testing random walks,
    so you had to read between the lines to see the implication. DE Shaw made a lot
    of money trading this strategy back then, so perhaps Bezos funded Amazon with
    that strategy. A popular version of this was pairs trading, where for example,
    one would buy Coke and sell Pepsi if Coke went down while Pepsi was flat. Pairs
    trading became much less profitable around 2003, right after the internet bubble
    burst. However, this is a great example of an academic paper that proved valuable
    for those discerning enough to see its real value (note that Lehmann’s straightforward
    strategy was never a highly popular academic paper).

    they did not tell anyone about it. They would tell interviewees they used neural
    nets, a concept like AI or machine-learning today: trendy and vague. I have witnessed
    this camouflage tactic firsthand several times, where a trader’s edge was *x*,
    but he would tell others something plausible unrelated to *x*. Invariably, the
    purported edge was more complicated and sophisticated than the real edge (e.g.,
    “I use a Kalman filter to estimate latent high-frequency factors that generate
    dynamic alphas” vs. “I buy 50 losers and sell 50 winners every Monday using last
    week’s industry-adjusted returns”).'

    about how well all of them do when combined. Below is a matrix of the correlation
    of the returns for these single strategies. You can see that by using an industry-adjusted
    return, the monthly mean-reversion signal becomes significantly negatively correlated
    with industry momentum. While I like the idea of reducing the direct offsetting
    effects (high industry returns —> go long; high returns —> go short), I am uncomfortable
    with how high the negative correlation is. In finance, large correlations among
    explanatory variables suggest redundancy and not efficient diversification.

    z-scores and adds them up. This ‘normalize and add’ approach is a robust way to
    create a multifactor model when you do not have a strong theory (e.g., Fama-French
    factors vs Black-Scholes). Robyn Dawes made a case for this technique [here](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/sds/docs/dawes/the-robust-beauty-of-improper-linear-models-in-decision-making.pdf).
    His paper was included in Kahneman, Slovic, and Tversky’s seminal [Judgment under
    Uncertainty](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/judgment-under-uncertainty/6F9E814794E08EC43D426E480A4B412C),
    a collection of essays on bias published in 1982\. In contrast, multivariate regression
    weights (coefficients) will be influenced by the covariances among the factors
    as well as the correlation with the explanatory variable. These anomalies are
    known only for their correlation with future returns, not their correlations with
    each other. Thus, excluding their correlation effects *ex ante* is an efficient
    way of avoiding overfitting, in the same way that a linear regression restricts
    but dominates most other techniques (simple is smart). The key is to normalize
    the significant predictors into comparable units (e.g., z-scores, percentiles)
    and add them up.

    applied the more sophisticated regression approach to weighting factors in the
    early 2000s, and it was a mess. This is why I do not consider Haugen the [OG](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=OG)
    of low vol investing. He was one of the first to note that low volatility was
    correlated with higher-than-average returns, but he buried that finding among
    a dozen other factors, each with several flavors. He sold my old firm Deephaven
    a set of 50 factors circa 2003 using rolling regressions, and the factor loading
    on low vol bounced from positive to negative; the model promoted historical returns
    of 20+% every year for the past 20 years, while never working while I saw it.

    and add’ approach is best for something like what Robeco does here, and in general
    one needs to be very thoughtful about restricting interaction effects (e.g., don’t
    just throw them into a machine learning algorithm).

    a zero return to handle this problem. This has the nice property of adjusting
    for the fact that some implementations have a lower turnover than others, so that
    aspect of the strategy is then included within the tests. The y-axis in the chart
    below represents the one-way transaction costs that would make the strategy generate
    a zero excess return. Combining signals almost doubles the returns, which makes
    sense. You should not expect an *n*-factor model to be *n* times better than a
    1-factor model.

    costs, more than it lowers the top-line returns. Thus, in the chart below, no
    single anomaly can overcome its transaction costs, but a multifactor approach
    can. Further, you can make straightforward adjustments to entry and exit rules
    that increase the net return even while decreasing the gross return (far right
    vs. middle columns).

    return to fall by half, suggesting the results were not driven by the short side.
    This is important because it is difficult to get a complete historical dataset
    of short borrow costs, and many objectively bad stocks cannot be shorted at any
    rate.

    chart below from the Hesten and Sadka (2006) paper on the monthly seasonal effect.
    This shows the average lagged regression weighting on prior monthly returns for
    a single stock. Note the pronounced 12-month spike, as if a stock has a particular
    best month that persists for 20 years. The stability of this effect over time
    looks too persistent to be true, suggesting a measurement issue more than a real
    return.

- en: Another problem in this literature is that presenting the ‘alphas’ or residuals
    to a factor portfolio is often better thought of as a reflection of a misspecified
    model as opposed to an excess return. Note that the largest factor in these models
    is the CAPM beta. We know that beta is at best uncorrelated with cross-sectional
    returns. Thus, you can easily generate a large ‘excess return’ merely by defining
    this term relative to a prediction everyone knows has a systematic bias (i.e.,
    high beta stocks should do better, but don’t). You could create a zero-beta portfolio,
    add it to a beta=1.0 portfolio and seemingly create a dominant portfolio, but
    that is not obvious. The time-varying idiosyncratic risk to these tilts does not
    diversify away and could reduce the Sharpe of a simple market portfolio.

    a paper by [Medhat and Schmeling (2021)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3150525).
    They found that monthly mean reversion only applies to low turnover stocks; for
    high turnover stocks, the effect is to find its opposite month-to-month momentum.
    I do not see that, but this highlights the many degrees of freedom in these studies.
    How do you define ‘excess’ returns? What is the size cut-off in your universe?
