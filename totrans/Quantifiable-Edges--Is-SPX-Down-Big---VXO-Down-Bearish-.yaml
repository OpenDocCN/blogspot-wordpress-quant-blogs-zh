- en: Interesting about today is that while the S&P dropped well over 2%, the VIX
    (and VXO) also dropped. Often traders will interpret this as bearish. The thought
    process is that when the VXO doesn’t drop with the market it suggests a possible
    complacency among traders. The theory is that this complacency may lead to further
    selling until participants become somewhat fearful again. At that point a rally
    will become more probable.

    no evidence to support the bearish case. For testing I looked at a 5-day divergence
    to measure the return in the VXO and S&P prior to triggering. Tonight I looked
    at a 1-day divergence.

    strongly bullish.

    I make every effort to test all of my trading and market bias ideas.
