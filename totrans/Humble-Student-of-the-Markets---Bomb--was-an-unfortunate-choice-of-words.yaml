    didn't mean a good old fashioned Keynesian stimulus program consisting of military
    spending. Nevertheless, that may be happening as a side-effect of China's economic
    ascendancy.

    it was inevitable that military tensions would rise between China and the US.
    If we assume that Chinese military were to spend a constant amount as a percentage
    of GDP, which is natural given that it does have strategic interests in the region.
    Just by virtual of its fast growth, China would be seen as threat to the US and
    other Asian countries one day. I further added that since my colleague was born
    in Mainland China, it may be uncomfortable for him and his family should that
    day arrive (even if he acquired American citizenship). He disagreed and pooh-poohed
    the idea that China and America should come into conflict.
