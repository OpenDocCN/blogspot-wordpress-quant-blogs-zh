    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    one of the biggest years on record for the amount of money raised in U.S.-listed
    IPOs. The total will reach $80 billion this year, double the yearly average since
    1999, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. predicted in November—an estimate that may prove
    low. And there’s no arguing that peaks in IPOs have occurred near major tops in
    the stock market and close to the onset of recessions. Both 1999 and 2007 were
    unusually strong years for IPOs that were swiftly followed by nasty bear markets
    in stocks and downturns in the economy.
