    and the [European sovereign debt crisis](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/European%20sovereign%20debt%20crisis)
    both declined over the course of the past week, as stocks made a concerted effort
    to establish a bottom, following an 8.9% decline in the S&P 500 index, according
    to the *VIX and More* weekly [fear poll](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Fear%20poll).

    to express concern about weak earnings and guidance going forward, with earnings

- en: The biggest changes in investor sentiment have come in the form of growing discontent
    with institutions such as central banks and governments and concerns that their
    intervention in economic matters will have more of a negative than positive effect.
    [Fears](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/fear) about excessive intervention
    on the part of central banks as well as more broadly with the role of governments
    and politicians were largely absent just two weeks ago. Taken together, this lack
    of trust with respect to the two influential policy-making institutions is now
    as big as concern as that of the fiscal cliff or the euro zone woes, as shown
    in the graphic below.

- en: The persistent Americentric bias is still apparent. This week, for example,
    8.5% more of the U.S. respondents cited the fiscal cliff as the top concern over
    the European sovereign debt crisis. For non-U.S. respondents, however, the European
    sovereign debt crisis outpolled the fiscal cliff by a margin of 3.2%.

- en: Also of note from a geographical perspective, U.S. respondents were 1.8% more
    likely than non-U.S. respondents to tab excessive central bank intervention as
    their top fear and 5.9% more likely to point to government and politicians as
    their biggest concern. In addition to placing higher emphasis on the European
    sovereign debt crisis, non-U.S. respondents also expressed much more concern about
    [China](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/China) and deflation.
