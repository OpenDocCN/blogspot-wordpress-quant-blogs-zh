- en: Keep in mind, Greece is not being bailed out. Greece's bondholders are being
    bailed out. Greece would rather default. Cleared of its debts, it would likely
    be able to borrow again soon.

- en: One would think that wise regulators would have required hefty capital against
    sovereign lending, or lending to other banks whose main investments are Greek
    debt. One would think that given a full year, those regulators would have at least
    increased the capital requirements for sovereign debt, run serious stress tests
    against sovereign default, or forced banks to buy credit-default swap insurance
    from counterparties other than Greek banks. But one would be wrong. (This is a
    sobering lesson for the U.S.'s plan under Dodd-Frank to trust that our wise regulators
    will spot all dangers, require adequate capital, and keep banks from getting into
    trouble.)

- en: Third, the European Central Bank (ECB) is now involved as well. It started buying
    secondary-market Greek debt last May. The ECB has now lent in excess of 80 billion
    euros to Greek banks, replacing private funding that has run away, and typically
    receiving Greek government debt as collateral.

- en: Under Basel II in December 2009, Greek government bonds, rated A-/A2, had the
    same 20 percent risk weight as AA/AAA asset-backed securities in the United States.
    It seemed like easy money, and banks levered it up. As usual, regulations did
    not alleviate the problem, rather, they encouraged it.
