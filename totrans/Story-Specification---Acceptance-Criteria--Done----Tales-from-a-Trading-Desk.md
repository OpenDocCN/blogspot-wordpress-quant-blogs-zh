## Story Specification – Acceptance Criteria “Done”

The Agilist off a few well define [requirements](http://theagilist.com/2014/03/10/503/) on testing, coupled with noting testing needs to execute with a “representative sample of actual production data:

*   Acceptance criteria are the definition of “done”
*   Passing tests are the measure of “done”
*   Regression tests are the measure of “still done”
