    me a little of politicians in the sense that I have seen a dramatic increase in
    both the polarization of ideas and the stridency of the tone in which various
    points of view are presented. To some extent, the two are related and the bifurcation
    is understandable. Strong macroeconomic winds are blowing and the range of possible
    outcomes now seemingly includes quite a few more extreme scenarios than it did
    just a few years ago. The move toward a more decentralized media has also probably
    reinforced this trend.

    partly explained by the nature of the institutions and political processes that
    tend to herd voters into opposing camps. In the investment world, the shrinking
    of the centrist philosophy is more difficult to understand. After all, if two
    equally extreme scenarios each have the same probabilities associated with them,
    then the mathematical expectation is zero and represents no change at all.

    to expect stocks to trend strongly in one direction or the other. The truth is
    that we haven’t seen a good sideways market in a long time and investors just
    don’t expect a trading range to develop any more. The centrists have either slowly
    gone broke or have been banished to Extremia (just west of Siberia, if I recall
    correctly.)

    my neck out and predict that SPX 666-1219 will likely define a trading range going
    forward, but perhaps more importantly, the tighter 1040-1219 range could also
    serve as a trading range for a surprisingly long period. Just because there are
    two large extremist camps doesn’t mean that both bulls and bears can’t be wrong.

    are likely to perform well, particularly if high volatility persists. This means
    [covered calls](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/covered%20calls) may
    soon be back in vogue, with more advanced traders looking at the likes of [straddles](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/straddle),
