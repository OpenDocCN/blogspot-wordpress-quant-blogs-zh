    all-time high. Moreover, the recent sideways consolidation has elevated the VIX
    Index to near its upper Bollinger Band. An upside breakout of the Bollinger Band
    would constitute an oversold reading for the stock market that carries with it
    the prospect of more price gains. The market is presenting investors with an unusual
    condition of a breakout test while exhibiting a near oversold condition.

    weakness ahead. Even though a melt-up into year-end remains my base case, investors
    need to practice some risk control in case the advance unravels.
