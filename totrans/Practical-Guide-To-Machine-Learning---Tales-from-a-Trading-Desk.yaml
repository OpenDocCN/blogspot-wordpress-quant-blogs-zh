- en: H2O has a number of useful white papers, some of which I’ve already blog links
    too.  “Practical [Guide](http://university.h2o.ai/business-101/downloads/practical-guide-to-machine-learning.pdf)
    To Machine Learning” dropped into my mail box this morning.  Although not new,
    the paper does remind us of the benefit of venturing down a machine learning road
    if you are willing to put in the time to understand your data, and figure out
    the algorithms (over 150 classification algorithms are available today) that can
    help answer the business questions.

    reduced costs or some other key business driver. Possible examples include (but
    are not limited to): detecting and preventing fraud; detecting security risks
    and threats; measuring credit and default risk; and other high-impact problems.
    If you can’t find problems like this in your business, you’re not looking hard
    enough; every business has opportunities to improve.'
