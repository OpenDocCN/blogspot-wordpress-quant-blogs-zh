    in her Congressional testimony that the neutral rate for Fed Funds is roughly
    the inflation rate, which is much lower than market expectations. In addition,
    she allowed that the Fed is likely to re-evaluate its tightening path in light
    of tame inflation figures.

    process closely before making a determination on further adjustments to the federal
    funds rate in light of the recent softness in core PCE (personal consumption expenditures)
    inflation...I will want to monitor inflation developments carefully, and to move
    cautiously on further increases in the federal funds rate, so as to help guide
    inflation back up around our symmetric target.

    low inflation releases may prompt a shallower path for rate hikes in 2017 and
    2018\. Brainard stated on Thursday, before the CPI release, "I don’t think anybody
    can give a fully satisfactory answer to why we’re seeing the inflation trajectory
    that we see today."

    falls substantially below 5%. The graph below depicts the unemployment rate (blue
    line, with the zero level set at 5%), with CPI (red line). The rise in inflation
    has been quite tame by historical standards, which is creating a dilemma for policy
    makers.

    a trade-off between inflation and unemployment. As the chart from this

    been flattening since 2000\. Falling unemployment should drive up wages, which
    is the price of labor, and put upward pressure on inflation. This time, the wage
    and inflation response has been muted.
