- en: The range over the last week has been extremely tight.  Every SPY close in the
    5 days since 8/7 has been within the daily range of that 8/7/12 bar.  It is said
    that consolidations are often resolved in the direction of the trend.  This guideline
    suggests that we’re more likely to see another leg up from here than a breakdown.
     The study below puts this to the test.

    the long side over the immediate 3-day period and they are even more impressive
    when looking out 8 to 10 days.
