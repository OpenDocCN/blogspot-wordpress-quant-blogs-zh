- en: The Fed's next meeting, June 19 and 20, could be too soon for conclusive decisions.
    Fed policy makers have many unanswered questions and have had trouble forming
    a consensus in the past. Top Fed officials have said that they would support new
    measures if they became convinced the U.S. wasn't making progress on bringing
    down unemployment. Recent disappointing employment reports have raised this possibility,
    but the data might be a temporary blip. Moreover, the Fed's options for more easing
    are sure to stir internal resistance at the central bank if they are considered.

    more strongly signaling a willingness to act later if the outlook more clearly
    worsens. Fed policy makers could take a small precautionary measure, like extending
    for a short period its "Operation Twist" program—in which the Fed is selling short-term
    securities and using the proceeds to buy long-term securities. Or, ***policy makers
    could take bolder action such as launching another large round of bond purchases
    if they become convinced of a significant slowdown.***
