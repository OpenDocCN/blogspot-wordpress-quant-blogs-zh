- en: For practical central bankers, among which I now count myself, Friedman and
    Schwartz's analysis leaves many lessons. What I take from their work is the idea
    that monetary forces, particularly if unleashed in a destabilizing direction,
    can be extremely powerful. The best thing that central bankers can do for the
    world is to avoid such crises by providing the economy with, in Milton Friedman's
    words, a "stable monetary background"--for example as reflected in low and stable
    inflation.

    easing this week by announcing a plan to buy at least $500 billion of long-term
    securities, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.

    it has been, but the Fed is now trying to fine tune the yield curve. Bernanke''s
    praise of Friedman''s work, which promoted stable monetary growth rates, remind
    me of Marx (Groucho, not Karl): "those are my principles. If you don''t like them,
    I have others." Here''s the monetary base, the only monetary aggregate the Fed
    has direct control over. We are in uncharted waters.'
