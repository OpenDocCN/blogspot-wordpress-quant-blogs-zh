Thanks to Steven Sears at [Barron’s](http://online.barrons.com/) for giving me an opportunity to contribute to his excellent options column, The Striking Price Daily, while he is on vacation.

It should surprise very few readers that I elected to write about a subject that has garnered a great deal of attention on this blog, the CBOE S&P 500 Three-Month Volatility Index. Of course we just call it [VXV](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXV) here. The Barron’s column, [Take a Longer View on Volatility](http://online.barrons.com/article/SB124648899704482887.html), is available to subscribers and non-subscribers alike.
