- en: Everybody loves trading or investing in ETPs. ETP is the acronym for exchange-traded
    products, which include both exchange-traded funds (ETF) and exchange-traded notes
    (ETN). They seem simple, transparent, easy to understand. But there are a few
    subtleties that you may not know about.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 1) The most popular ETN is VXX, the volatility index ETF. Unlike ETF, ETN is
    actually an
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*unsecured*'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: bond issued by the issuer. This means that the price of the ETN may not just
    depend on the underlying assets or index. It could potentially depend on the credit-worthiness
    of the issuer. Now VXX is issued by Barclays. You may think that Barclays is a
    big bank, Too Big To Fail, and you may be right. Nevertheless, nobody promises
    that its credit rating will never be downgraded. Trading the VX future, however,
    doesn't have that problem.

- en: 2) The ETP issuer, together with the "Authorized Participants"  (the market
    makers who can ask the issuer to issue more ETP shares or to redeem such shares
    for the underlying assets or cash), are supposed to keep the total market value
    of the ETP shares closely tracking the NAV of the underlying assets. However,
    there was one notable instance when the issuer deliberately not do so, resulting
    in big losses for some investors.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That was when the issuer of TVIX, the leveraged ETN that tracks 2x the daily
    returns of VXX, stopped all creation of new TVIX shares temporarily on February
    22, 2012 (see

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: ). That issuer is Credit Suisse, who might have found that the transaction costs
    of rebalancing this highly volatile ETN were becoming too high. Because of this
    stoppage, TVIX turned into a closed-end fund (temporarily), and its NAV diverged
    significantly from its market value. TVIX was trading at a premium of 90% relative
    to the underlying index. In other words, investors who bought TVIX in the stock
    market by the end of March were paying 90% more than they would have if they were
    able to buy the VIX index instead. Right after that, Credit Suisse announced they
    would resume the creation of TVIX shares. The TVIX market price immediately plummeted
    to its NAV per share, causing huge losses for those investors who bought just
    before the resumption.

    This is because various market makers including the Authorized Participants for
    DOG weren''t making markets at that time. But an equally important point to note
    is that at the end of the trading day, DOG did return 3.2%, almost exactly -1x
    the return of DIA (the ETF that tracks the Dow 30). So it functioned as advertised.
    Lesson learned: We aren''t supposed to use inverse ETFs for intraday nor long

    1 to December 31, 2013, tracking the same 24% drop in spot gold price. However,
    its NAV dropped 52%. Why? The Authorized Participants redeemed many GLD shares,
    causing the shares outstanding of GLD to decrease from 416 million to 266 million.
     Is that a problem? Not at all. An investor in that ETF only cares that she experienced
    the same return as spot gold, and not how much assets the ETF held. The author
    of that comment letter strangely wrote that "Investors wishing to participate
    in the gold market would not buy the GLD if they knew that a price decline in
    gold could result in twice as much underlying asset decline for the GLD." That,
    I believe, is nonsense.
