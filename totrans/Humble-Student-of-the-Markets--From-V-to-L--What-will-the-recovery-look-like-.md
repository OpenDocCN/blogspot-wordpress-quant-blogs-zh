# Humble Student of the Markets: From V to L: What will the recovery look like?

I suppose I should be used to it by now. Last week's initial jobless claims spiked to 6.6 million, and the March headline Non-Farm Payroll printed at a dismal -701K. The unemployment rate would have been even worse had the participation rate not fallen and depressed the size of the labor force. My desk has been flooded with bear porn.

Wall Street economists are racing to downgrade their Q2 GDP growth forecasts. Among many, Goldman Sachs last week reduced their already downbeat forecast to an annualized -34% from -24%, and unemployment to reach an astounding 15%.

Even more astonishing is the latest White House announced goal of reducing the number of COVID-19 deaths to a range of 100,000 to 240,000.

Rather than just wallow in more unnecessary bearishness, a more useful exercise is to consider how the economy might evolve from BC (Before Coronavirus) to AD (After the Disease). What will the recovery look like? There is a wide continuum of recovery shapes from V to L.
