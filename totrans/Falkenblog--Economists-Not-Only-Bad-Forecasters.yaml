    the accolades for astronauts and our space program as this was not only dangerous
    and difficult, but supposedly really important. It would supposedly help us manufacture
    drugs, create moon colonies, etc. The whole manned space flight program since
    Apollo has been a failure, producing absolutely zero new scientific theories or
    data.

    dividends, to science, to politics. It's easy with hindsight to see how irrational
    past beliefs were, and it would be interesting to know how much of conventional
