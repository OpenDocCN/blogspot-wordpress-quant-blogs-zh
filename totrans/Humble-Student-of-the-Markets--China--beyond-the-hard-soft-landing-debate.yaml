    deemed to be "systemically important" to growth. Insiders of that sector have
    made obscene profits from the growth. One day, we wake up and find that that sector
    has gotten in over the heads. The "logical" free-market solution is the let that
    sector go down and allow the economy to re-balance, but sector insiders have a
    cozy relationship with the government. If leading companies in that sector goes
