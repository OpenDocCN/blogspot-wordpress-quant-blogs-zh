- en: theory, is basically that the internet has made holding inventory less costly,
    so instead of having a couple of top brands, you can make more money catering
    to a large number of niche buyers. The example is iTunes, where much of their
    sales is in small bands. Narrowly-targeted goods and services can be as economically
    attractive as mainstream ones, so it's the long tail that we should care about.

- en: Some of the reasons for the popularity of the Long Tail were as interesting
    as the idea itself. For one, it flattered its readers, many of whom were in the
    tech industry, by suggesting (yet again) that the Internet was changing everything.
    What's more, since many in the tech elite have a contemptuous view of traditional
    cultural gatekeepers like record labels and movie studios, they were predisposed
    to appreciate anything that predicted an erosion of those institutions' cultural
    power.

    empirically, they are The Vanguard, and they will tell their colleagues, in all
    sincerity, 'this guy is a genius', because he is saying what they are doing is
    important.

    analysis. I was reading an awful business book, and it was blurbed by famous Nobel
    Prize Winner X. X remarked on what a beautiful and important book was in these
    covers, even though it was basically a taxonomy of ideas from the eighties, with
    tables of data from the past 10 years. Coincidentally, there was a 2-page, irrelevant,
    aside about the brilliance of X's work stuffed within the book. I wonder how many
    book blurbers are in tit-for-tat mode (either for gratuitous veneration within
    the book, or as payment for future blurbs from this publisher)?
