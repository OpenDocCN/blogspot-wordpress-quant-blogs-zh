- en: theory, is basically that the internet has made holding inventory less costly,
    so instead of having a couple of top brands, you can make more money catering
    to a large number of niche buyers. The example is iTunes, where much of their
    sales is in small bands. Narrowly-targeted goods and services can be as economically
    attractive as mainstream ones, so it's the long tail that we should care about.

  zh: 在这个理论中，基本上是因特网使持有库存成本更低，所以你可以赚更多的钱满足大量的利基买家，而不是只有几个顶级品牌。以iTunes为例，他们很大部分的销售在小乐队中。狭隘定位的商品和服务可以像主流商品一样经济吸引人，所以我们应该关注的是长尾。

- en: Some of the reasons for the popularity of the Long Tail were as interesting
    as the idea itself. For one, it flattered its readers, many of whom were in the
    tech industry, by suggesting (yet again) that the Internet was changing everything.
    What's more, since many in the tech elite have a contemptuous view of traditional
    cultural gatekeepers like record labels and movie studios, they were predisposed
    to appreciate anything that predicted an erosion of those institutions' cultural
    power.

  zh: “长尾”流行的原因之一非常有趣，正如这一想法本身。首先，它奉承了它的读者，很多人是科技行业的人，它再次暗示互联网正在改变一切。更重要的是，由于很多技术精英对传统文化守门人（如唱片公司和影片公司）持轻蔑的看法，他们是有偏见的，接受天然倾向于欣赏任何预示这些机构文化权力的削弱的东西。

- en: Many successful books are filled with disingenuous flattery disguised as thoughtful
    analysis. I was reading an awful business book, and it was blurbed by famous Nobel
    Prize Winner X. X remarked on what a beautiful and important book was in these
    covers, even though it was basically a taxonomy of ideas from the eighties, with
    tables of data from the past 10 years. Coincidentally, there was a 2-page, irrelevant,
    aside about the brilliance of X's work stuffed within the book. I wonder how many
    book blurbers are in tit-for-tat mode (either for gratuitous veneration within
    the book, or as payment for future blurbs from this publisher)?

    X 工作的优点。我想知道多少书的评语撰写者在进行互惠（要么为了书中肤浅的奉承，要么是作为对出版商未来给予好评的回报）？
