- en: This spreadsheet shows the implementation of the Minimum Correlation Algorithm
    (mincorr). The power function is a new parameter that regulates the weighting
    in the averaging process toward the most anti-correlated assets. Currently the
    default is “1” which is essentially a rank-weighted moving average of pair-wise
    correlations.  A value of “0” would imply equal weightings, values lower than
    1 would imply a balance between equal and rank weighting, while values higher
    than 1 would more heavily skew the rank-weighting. More spreadsheets and research
    will be available soon.
