    laws be they physical or those that govern society that provide order to our lives.
    Our notions of the world are neatly boxed by our own limited cognition and inability
    to conceptualize the abstract or unfamiliar. In the financial markets the pronounced
    quest for simplicity has left us with incomplete and inadequate models such as
    the CAPM, beta, mean-variance optimization and the EMH (efficient markets hypothesis).
    Mathematicians are the kings of deriving solutions to complex problems from simple
    abstractions, and this proved to be an irresistable panacea to institutions and
    investors desperate for guidance. Little did they know the destruction that naiive
    deductions borne from complex proofs could wreak on their fragile portfolios.

    laws” we might be able to peer at the workings of price movements as the bi-product
    of an aggregation of simple effects. Volatility ergo gravity, and other laws could
    neatly describe the landscape in which traders and investors operate. The “J and
    K” momentum effect, and the “Fama and French,” and many other “effects” discovered
    could be used as blocks to build a larger pyramid that describes precisely how
    the market works. In the quest to function like other branches of scientific academia,
    finance has created a crippling framework that requires a simple unified theory
    to organize the research. Since professors are no more righteous in defending
    their turf than the common man, we have spent years deeply entrenched in ludicrous
    theoretical debates that could never possibly describe something so complex as
    the stock market.  Followers of this research understand that the original troupe
    of the EMH brigade suppressed all dissenting studies from adding any perspective.
    Their actions taken in some cases to shun contradictory studies were so extreme
    that they shared more in common with radical religious or cult leaders. To say
    that these were true men of science–in the quest to find the truth– would be an
    insult to science itself.

    be a professor at an Ivy League school is to be an unquestionable authority on
    the subject matter of your specialty. Both your students and members of the industry
    put unquestioning faith in the set of principles and body of knowledge that you
    present.  Bring together a band of such individuals with mutual goals, and invariably
    “groupthink” will prevail. The truth is, after 10 years studying the markets,
    I look back on my days as an MBA and all of my formal training much like a man
    reflecting on his childhood: 1) the naiive simplicity of life that you were presented
    by your parents was designed to shield you from the ambiguities and uncertainty
    of being an adult 2) reality is a lot less orderly than you ever imagined. 3)
    there are no easy answers to seemingly simple questions–the rules to guide your
    life that your parents taught you rarely apply in every situation.  The markets
    are exactly the same– no simple guide will tell us what to do, and even the experienced
    professionals seem to be confounded by relationships or events that they never
    thought possible.'

    noise dominates the data that mysteriously eludes linear models such as regression.
    Ardent neural network fans will acknowledge the tremendous instability of turnkey
    applications to improve prediction within the data. What order truly lies beneath
    the noise in financial markets can only be uncovered by exploring all avenues
    without bias or prejudice. If we limit ourselves by the neccessity of explaining
    things in terms that are familiar than we will neccessarily constrict our ability
    to discover the truth. Our desire for simple rules for trading, and simple laws
    for describing our world come at the expense of the reality of what the market
    actually is—anything else is a childhood fairy tale.
