In the health care debate, many have noted the high level of administration expense, as there's the idea that without marketing expense, public healthcare will be cheaper.

Marketing has always seemed wasteful to those who are optimistic about government solutions, and indeed a big theme of

[John Kenneth Galbraith](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kenneth_Galbraith)

's oeuvre was that businesses waste money advertising. It seem that many think advertizements merely reallocate our expenditures in a zero-sum game of moving from Coke to Pepsi, Bud to Coors, without any real effects.

[The Effect of Advertising on the Price of Eyeglasses](http://bpp.wharton.upenn.edu/waldfogj/987/readings/benham.pdf)

It seems that without advertising, firms don't compete as much, leading to higher prices.
