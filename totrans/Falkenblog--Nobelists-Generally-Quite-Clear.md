A Nobel prize winning mind should at least have a good command of language, of seeing the major point, and making a clear argument. Thus, I appreciated this

in the University of Chicago paper between James Heckman, who won a Nobel for his econometric work, and John Cochrane, who is probably one of the 10 best (ie, most actively cited) finance professors alive. Heckman noted he was agreeable to suggestions they rename the proposed 'Milton Friedman Institute', which, if I were giving money, would be a deal breaker, because if you are that ashamed of the name 'Milton Friedman', then it is clear the funding will devolve into the standard littany of trendy academic pursuits, unrelated to Friedman. Secondly, Heckman suggested that the University President was moving the Friedman institute too quickly, presumably, dismissing all the leftists in the Chicago Academy who see 'free minds and free markets' as a codeword for fascism and repression.

You may have long, convoluted explanations, but that won’t do much good when this sort of thing gets out.

Heckman responded (via email)
