- en: In the Quebec case, the sovereigntist message was, "We can have our own country,
    our own culture and at the same time have the economic benefits of Canada as well."
    The reasoning went something like this. If Quebec were to separate, Canada would
    have no choice but to enter into some sort of economic association with Quebec,
    as the economies are so intricately connected with each other. Quebec would even
    use the Canadian Dollar as its currency (a bad idea given the eurozone experience
    of not having control of your own monetary policy, but they didn't know that then).
    Canada has always allowed dual citizenship, so Quebec citizens could retain their
    Canadian citizenship, so what's the big deal?

    there were two messages, one offering a carrot and the other a stick. There was
    the tough talk about the dire consequences of what happens if Quebec were to leave.
    You're either in or out. Don't expect a sweet deal, or any deal on economic association
    if you were to leave. For example, there was some dispute of how much of Canada's
    national debt Quebec were to assume if it were to become a separate country. I
    can recall that Diane Francis of the conservative National Post suggesting that
    Canada should unilaterally separate Government of Canada bonds and notes by a
    set amount and declare a portion to be Quebec's obligation.
