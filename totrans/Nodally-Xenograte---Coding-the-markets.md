## Nodally Xenograte

### April 10, 2014

Well, [xenograte](http://xenograte.com) from [nodally](http://nodally.com) sounds pretty cool: loosely coupled software components in the cloud. [Brad Cox’s dream of snap together building blocks](http://virtualschool.edu/cox/pub/PSIR/), finally realised. [Yahoo Pipes](http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/), anyone? I’ve even hacked around similarly motivated code myself, but never got so far of course. The problem with these new paradigms is that they ask you to throw away all your old software assets so you can rebuild them again in the new framework. A bit like media companies asking us to buy the same content over and over on different formats: LPs, tapes, CDs, audio DVDs, downloads, pono, VHS, DVD, bluray….  Why can’t someone find a way to breath fresh life into existing assets without reengineering them. Why not, indeed?
