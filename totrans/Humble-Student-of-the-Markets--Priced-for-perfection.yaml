    long research piece combined with a tactical trading commentary, which has at
    times been very long. As an experiment, I am splitting the two up. Please let
    me know if you prefer the format of two shorter posts, or a combined longer publication.

    which roughly matches the level last seen at the melt-up high of early 2018.

    biggest gap since early 2018 and on the longest win-streak since mid-2017, according
    to the sum of Citi’s economic surprise indices I compiled using Bloomberg. Geopolitical
    risk between the U.S. and China is fading, Brexit is on some path toward completion,
    a dropping dollar is providing relief to emerging economies, and the global banking
    system is still intact despite an unnerving foray into the land of negative interest
    rates. So stocks are rallying as things improve. It’s as simple as that.

    risk has compressed risk premiums, and conversely, boosted P/E ratios.
