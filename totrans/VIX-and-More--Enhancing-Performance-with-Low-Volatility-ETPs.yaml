    ETPs is one of the key revolutionary ideas to appear in the investment world in
    recent memory, I will have a great deal to say about this subject and the many
    tangential ideas that arise from it going forward.  After nine years focusing
    primarily on the VIX, volatility and related subjects, it is time to charge off
    in some new directions, starting with some that have a whiff of volatility and
    ETP innovation.

    ETPs with marginal liquidity, this list may not touch upon some of the many new
    and illiquid products that might be flying under the radar.
