    has found a rhythm and started delivering, is that the new member always find
    issue with the [SDLC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_development_life_cycle)
    that’s in place.  This isn’t surprising since the new team member is often unaware
    of the history of decisions due to not being told the full history of the project,
    or that the team has forgotten why certain things occurred a certain way.  This
    leads to a few thoughts:'

    opinions just for the “hell of it” is like throwing stones at a glasshouse.  If

    New team member’s trying to do “their thing”, be it coding [style](http://blog.smartbear.com/code-review/clashing-coding-styles-learning-to-work-with-a-growing-team-of-programmers/)
    or other, will cause friction with the existing team.  Working with the existing
    team is going to be far more productive in the short term, and will not alienate.
