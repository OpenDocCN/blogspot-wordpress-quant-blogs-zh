    However, the trade surplus has increased since the crisis.

    2.6 million. Meanwhile, domestic car sales collapsed from about 1.6 million before
    the bubble to around 900,000 now, although Spanish new car registrations are now
    growing by more than 20 per cent annually. More than 80 per cent of the cars currently

    cent of Spain’s GDP to foreigners. Now they send less than 1 per cent. Meanwhile,
    Spain’s banks still receive almost as much income from abroad, as a share of GDP,
    as they did before. The overall difference between payments to foreign holders
    of Spanish assets and income received by Spanish holders of foreign assets has
    shrunk by about 2 percentage points of GDP between the start of 2009 and the end
    of 2014.

    boom generally had falling sales, and had to respond by firing workers, cutting
    investment, and repaying their debts. (This is sort of similar to what other economists
