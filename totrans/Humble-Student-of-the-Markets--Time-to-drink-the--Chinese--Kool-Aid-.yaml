    measures several times in the past but then relaxed them as soon as the market
    felt the bite. The bottom line is that local governments, and Beijing through
    them, depend very much on property for fiscal revenues. And now, the market does
    not believe the government will cut off the hand that feeds it.

    another round of property inflation.*** Local governments have been using bank
    loans to resettle residents, and resettlement costs have skyrocketed since those
    being moved need enough compensation to buy properties at today''s prices. Unless
    property prices rise considerably, local governments will end up losing money,
    which they cannot afford.'

    last year. The overwhelming majority of end-user purchases probably came from
    resettled residents who used their compensation cash for down payments. Resettlement
    compensation is the biggest transfer of wealth from the government to the household
    sector since the privatization of low-cost public housing a decade ago. It is
    probably the most important government action supporting today's economy.

    is crossing below the 200-day moving average, a bearish technical sign. Traders
    should be extremely cautious near for any near-term weakness. Investors, on the
    other hand, may want to lighten up some positions but also watch the evolution
    of government policy to see if this is indeed a great buying opportunity.
