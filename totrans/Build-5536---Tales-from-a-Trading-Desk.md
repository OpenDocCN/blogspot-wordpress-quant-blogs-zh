## Build 5536

Didn’t work for me 😦 Anyone got any idea where the log file is so I can try and figure out why it failed to install on my Dell? The install on my HP portable was successful, but as usual Vista failed to detect the network cards 😦 Anyway, I’ve report the issues using the Microsoft Beta Client.
