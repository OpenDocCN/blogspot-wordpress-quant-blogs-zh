    model, with the general market index returns, the market-cap of the stock, and
    the book-to-price ratio as the only three factors driving returns. However, as
    I explained earlier, this factor model has a very long horizon. For the quantitative
    trader who needs to make money every month, the natural instinct is to look for
    a more “sophisticated” factor that works in the short term, or even to develop
    some kind of model that use different factors every month in response to “market
    condition”. Alas, other than hearsays and second-hand gossips, I have never witnessed
    an actual success of this approach in a hedge fund or proprietary trading group
    – at least a success that lasts for more than a year.'

    run by some of the most successful hedge funds today. However, there is a class
    of ETF (called “XTF”) marketed by PowerShares Capital Management that uses a similar
    factor approach for its stock selection criteria. According to media reports,
    each stock in these XTF’s is scored by 25 variables such as cash flow, earnings
    growth, price momentum, etc. This sounds like a classic factor model to me. This
    model is reportedly designed by the quantitative unit at American Stock Exchange.
    To find out if they have indeed discovered the holy grail of factor models, I
    looked at the performance of these XTF compared to their benchmarks.

    benchmark market index ETF’s, and finally the YTD differential returns up to December
    13, 2006\. (PJG and PJM have too short a history for this comparison.)

    To me, this is symptomatic of a factor model that does not have predictive power.
    (After all, if the differential returns are consistently negative, we could have
    long the ETF, short the XTF, and make consistent profits!) At the very least,
    this factor model may have a horizon much longer than what most traders would
    be interested in – in which case, why not just use the simple Fama-French model?'
