    securities, as accelerators in this financial crisis. I agree these are complex,
    as the derivatives involve a sequences of rules, creating a waterfall of cashflows
    during the life of the securities, and a sequence priority in the case of default.
    It is difficult to get data on the key variables needed to compute their value,
    which combined with the standard reporting of financial statements by banks, makes
    it anyone's guess whether the run on Bear was a mere liquidity event, or they
    were truly insolvent. In the average prospectus for a mortgage backed securities
    you have to carefully wade through legalese to the substantive language about
    how the security will evolve through time.

    of ethanol production in the US. What is the true economic viability of this approach
    to our energy concern? To do that, you need to know the costs of the inputs and
    compare them to the costs of the outputs, including the fixed costs involved in
    creating the capital necessary to produce and use this fuel source. There are
    a variety of governmental subsidies that make this exercise basically impossible.
    You have subsidies on corn via farm programs. You have tax breaks for ethanol
    producers, and those using machines that can use ethanol. You have mandates that
    impart an implicit subsidies, and an ethanol import tariffs that are an implicit
    subsidy. And you have tax breaks both for the R&D, and the capital investment
    into ethanol refineries. These occur at the Federal Government level via corporate
    tax breaks, breaks on investment in various facilities, Department of Energy and
    Agriculture grants, and their counterparts at the state level. How much does it
    cost to create a gallon of ethanol? Some even claim the increased price of corn
    from ethanol incentives saves money that would be spent via a competing government
    program, as

    of these ethanol subsidies. With all the subsidies, tarifs, and tax credits along
    the chain from farmland and inputs to the final sale at the pump, who knows?

    of costs to benefits, either encourage activity or squelches it. In government
    complexity prevents any such comparison, so that so many government programs persist
    indefinitely because such a day of reckoning never comes. The occasional financial
    crises of capitalism are not a bug, but a feature, because government programs
    never have crises, just continued missallocation of resources for generations.
    Be glad the stupid 'home ownership' policy has been stopped by this crisis, because
    that means it had a finite life. Public school education, Amtrak, all the meddling
    by our various government agencies just continues, without a crisis, and simply
    create more bloat and waste.

    I would ask: what is the cost--without government--of generating the same amount
    of energy via nuclear, solar, wind, gas, and ethanol? I keep hearing about how
    these alternatives to coal and gas are the future, but what is there current viability?
    Invariably, the proponents ignore the government''s action at some point in the
    process, but it is both ubiquitous and subtle, especially to the capital investment
    which for wind and solar is most of the cost and most of the pollution created
    in these alternatives.'
