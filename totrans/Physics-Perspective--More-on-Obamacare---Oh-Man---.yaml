    mostly know this; some things can be better organized by government. Why doesn't
    that message get out? Or don't economists really believe this? I can't tell.

    free; making a market for something often changes how we think about and value
    that thing, with huge implications for whether markets are beneficial or not.
    An important point he makes is that whether something should be left to the market
    IS NOT a question of economics; it always (or almost always) involves consideration
    of values far broader than economic efficiency and so goes way outside economists'
    claimed area of expertise.

    before reading Sandel's article, which is a little embarrassing, as I'm sure every
    graduate student in economics has read it as part of their ordinary training.
    I have a lot to learn. It is a fascinating book, a real classic, and suggests
    that some of our basic psychological and social behaviors must have long-term
    effects on our economic well being that the usual theories of markets completely
    miss. Kind of obvious when you say it like that, but this is economics.... people
    have tried very hard to deny the obvious.... Hirsch tried hard not to...
