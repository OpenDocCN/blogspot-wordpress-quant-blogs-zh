    embraced specific trading systems and investment disciplines. This is a cautionary
    tale of how systems fail.

- en: Lumber’s sensitivity to housing, a key source of domestic economic growth in
    the U.S., makes it a unique commodity as it pertains to macro fundamentals and
    risk-seeking behavior. On the opposite end of the spectrum is Gold, which is distinctive
    in that it historically exhibits safe-haven properties during periods of heightened
    volatility and stock market stress.

    the risk appetite of investors and the relative strength or weakness in economic
    conditions. When Lumber is leading Gold, volatility in equities tends to fall
    going forward. When Gold is leading Lumber, the opposite is true, and equity volatility
    tends to rise.

    risk appetite. The bottom panel of the accompanying chart shows the rolling correlation
    of the lumber/gold ratio (cyclical indicator) to the stock/bond ratio (risk appetite
    indicator). The lumber/gold ratio is rising, which is a buy signal for risky assets.

    a similar theme. The copper/gold ratio is telling a story of economic softness.
