    countries, four months ago, the issue de jour was [BRIC Update: China a Leader
    or an Outlier?](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/12/bric-update-china-leader-or-outlier.html)
    At that time, [China](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/China) was starting
    to move impressively off of an October bottom and [Russia](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Russia)
    was a notable laggard.'

    bottomed, it is Russia ([RSX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/RSX),
    red line) that has been the strongest performer, followed by India ([EPI](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EPI),
    blue line), with Brazil ([EWZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EWZ),
    gold line) and China ([FXI](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/FXI),
    black line) bringing up the rear.

    which is to determine how well the group as a whole is performing, if any particular
    country is separating itself from the pack, whether commodity producers or consumers
    are in favor, etc.

    Russia suffered disproportionately in the recent bear market. In the nine months
    from June 2008 to February 2009, the RSX Russian ETF lost more than 82% of its
    value. The last month, however, has seen some notable improvements. Russia’s [credit
    default swaps](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/credit%20default%20swaps),
    for instance, which reflect to the cost to insure the country’s debt, have improved
    from 694 to 412 in the last four weeks as the outlook for that country’s sovereign
    debt has improved dramatically.

    the relative performance of Russia and Brazil will say more about improvements
    in the commodities market as a whole than about the plight of a particular national
    economy.
