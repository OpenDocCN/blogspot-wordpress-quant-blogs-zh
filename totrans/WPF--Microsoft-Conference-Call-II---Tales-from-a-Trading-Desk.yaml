- en: I’ve just finished another conference call with a few members of the WPF team
    – Rob Relyea, Principal Architect for WPF and Kevin Gjerstad, Principal Group
    Program Manager for WPF. Thanks to Stevan Vidich, Industry Architect Microsoft
    Financial Services for setting up the Live Meeting sessions. Hopefully in the
    future I’ll be able to blog about some of the items that were discussed.
