    is at 116.40, up 7.5%.

- en: I continue to get quite a few questions about VXX, the [VIX ETN](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20ETN).
    The biggest issues, by far, seem to be around how well VXX tracks the VIX and
    how much juice to expect from VXX relative to the VIX.

- en: As best I can determine, when there are small day to day changes in the SPX,
    VXX should reflect, on average, approximately 35-40% of the daily change in the
    VIX. In more volatile markets, such as SPX daily changes of 3% or more, VXX should
    move, *on average*, about 55-60% as much as the VIX does. (Of course, on average,
    if you walk down the middle of a two way street you won’t get hit by oncoming
    traffic, but deviate to one side or the other even briefly…)
