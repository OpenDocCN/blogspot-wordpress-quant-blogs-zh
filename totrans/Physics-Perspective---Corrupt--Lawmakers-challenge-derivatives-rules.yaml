- en: The lawmakers, Republicans and Democrats alike, argue that some proposed rules
    could force Wall Street’s derivatives business overseas. They also say that regulators
    are ignoring a crucial exemption to the rules spelled out in the Dodd-Frank financial
    regulatory law.

- en: The law excused airlines, oil companies and other nonfinancial firms known as
    end-users from new restrictions, including a rule that derivatives must be cleared
    and traded on regulated exchanges. The firms use derivatives to hedge against
    unforeseen market changes, say a rise in fuel costs or interest rates, rather
    than to speculate.

    substantially increasing the cost of hedging for end-users, and needlessly tying
    up capital that would otherwise be used to create jobs and grow the economy,”

    the Senate Agriculture Committee, and Representative Frank D. Lucas, her Republican
    counterpart in the House, said in a letter this week to regulators.

    firms known as end-users" identifying those who have restrictions. Does anyone
    doubt that lawyers and accountants at Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and virtually every
    other big bank are working overtime right now deciding how they can turn the bank,
    or some subsidiary in the Cayman Islands, into an airline, oil company or other
    nonfinancial firm? I would bet they're just looking for a new pathway through
    which to route all their high risk stuff - and they've counseled the lawmakers
    on how they can best carve out some useful routes.

    take their financial engineering business overseas and blow up someone else's
    economy.
