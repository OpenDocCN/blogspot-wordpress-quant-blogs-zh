- en: There is little question that the stock market is wildly oversold. My intermediate
    term bottom spotting model has been flashing a buy signal for over a week. This
    signal is based on the combination of an oversold signal on the Zweig Breadth
    Thrust Indicators, and the NYSE McClellan Summation Index (NYSI) turning negative.
    In the past, this model has shown an uncanny ability to spot an intermediate bottom,
    but stock prices have continued to fall despite the buy signal.
