# Big Data – Where to start? | Tales from a Trading Desk

## Big Data – Where to start?

Information Week has an [interview](http://www.informationweek.com/big-data/news/big-data-analytics/big-data-faq-separating-signal-from-noise/240162766) with Phil Simon, author of Too Big to Ignore, which is worth a read.

“intuition” hasn’t been replaced is very apt.  I wonder how many people thought that creating big data sets would automatically mean AI would find all the patterns, and thus generate appropriate signals 🙂

Data Scientists – I can only imagine the contracting market explosion in London around this role.  Noise to signal.
