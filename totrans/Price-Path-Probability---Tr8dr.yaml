- en: I attended a quantitative algorithmic trading seminar 3 weeks ago where one
    presenter was discussing fill probability (in general terms). The presenter claimed
    that their model predicts the price path over the next few minutes to determine
    how best to read a VWAP strategy.

    possible to determine the probability of any given price path. If we can determine
    the probability of any given path through time from the current price to some
    final price in N seconds or minutes, we can compute the expected probability of
    going through a price level within some period of time.

    tree will simply be the sum of the probability of all sub-paths from Ts to Tn
    going through Pa. That part may be simple, but accurately determining the likely
    paths / probabilities is a hard research problem.

    look the more time it takes to compute a precise expectation. We must use a monte
    carlo analysis, sampling a calibrated timeseries equation, to approximate the
    expectation function.

    very hard research problem. Alas, if I told you my approach would have to kill
