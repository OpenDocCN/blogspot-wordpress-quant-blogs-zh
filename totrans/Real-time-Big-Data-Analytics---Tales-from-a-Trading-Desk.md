> 来源：[https://mdavey.wordpress.com/2013/11/26/real-time-big-data-analytics/#0001-01-01](https://mdavey.wordpress.com/2013/11/26/real-time-big-data-analytics/#0001-01-01)

## Real-time Big Data Analytics

David Smith’s “Real-time Big Data Analytics: From Deployment to Production” is worth a [watch](http://www.revolutionanalytics.com/webinars/real-time-big-data-analytics-deployment-production), with discussion on the four-layers of RTBDA technology stack and model development cycles:

*   Data
*   Analytics
*   Integration
*   Decision

May also be worth check out Revolution Analytics, and [RevoR](http://www.revolutionanalytics.com/high-performance-r).

Finally, Mike Ferguson offers a white [paper](http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?infotype=SA&subtype=WH&htmlfid=IML14333USEN), “Architecting a Big Data Platform for Analytics” prepared for IBM.
