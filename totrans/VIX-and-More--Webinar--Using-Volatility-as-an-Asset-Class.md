# VIX and More: Webinar: Using Volatility as an Asset Class

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2011/03/webinar-using-volatility-as-asset-class.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2011/03/webinar-using-volatility-as-asset-class.html#0001-01-01)

I recently participated in a webinar sponsored by [AdvisorOne](http://www.advisorone.com/) which tackled the subject of volatility as an asset class. Cliff Stanton of Prima Capital was the featured presenter and he presented the highlights from a white paper he authored, [Volatility as an Asset Class](http://www.primacapital.com/primasite/INFORMATION/WHITEPAPERS/tabid/217/Default.aspx). For those who are interested, I recommend clicking through the link above (free registration required) to review the white paper, which takes an in-depth look at the VIX over the course of 17 pages, from the index and its idiosyncrasies to the VIX futures and the first generation of VIX ETNs, [VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX) and [VXZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXZ).

As far as the VIX white paper is concerned, it would be a stretch for me to take issue with any of the analytical work or conclusions derived from the data. Instead, I chose to define the problem of volatility as an asset class more broadly and look at short volatility strategies, long-short strategies and VIX strategies that focus on the [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures) [term structure](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/term%20structure). In doing so, my comments build on my January 12^(th) Barron’s article, [Ways to Turn Volatility into an Asset Class](http://online.barrons.com/article/SB50001424052970204201404576077942647562616.html?mod=BOL_hps_dc) and make what I believe is a strong case for volatility products as an asset class.

Finally, since I have already gone out of my way to proclaim 2011 as the year volatility becomes a mainstream [asset class](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/asset%20class), I will have a lot more to say about this subject in the weeks and months ahead.
