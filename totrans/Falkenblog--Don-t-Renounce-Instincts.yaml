    a state of bliss that he no longer feels that he care more about his daughters
    than other children.  This he finds transcendent and logical.  I think it''s sad.
    As a child, I really liked the thought that my mom liked me more than others,
    and so unlike others really cared about my little travails. As a parent, I feel
    I need to protect and nurture my children because others won''t be nearly as attentive.
     It''s simply an evolutionary advantage to care more about one''s kids than others.
     It''s hard wired, and so I don''t feel one should be proud of losing this like
    losing one''s more irrational prejudices.  It''s good that we aren''t simply optimizing
    ''the collective'', but instead our kin, because remember: ants are not merely
    selfless, but genocidal and unempathetic.'

- en: (1944) tells the story of Larry Darrell, an American pilot traumatized by his
    experiences in World War I, who sets off in search of some transcendent meaning
    in his life. His rejection of conventional life and search for meaningful experience
    allows him to thrive while the more materialistic characters suffer reversals
    of fortune. When it ends all the characters are suffering for their foolish objectives
    in various ways whereas the protagonist achieves the total consciousness alluded
    to by Bill Murray's character in Caddyshack. The book ends noting that the lead
    character Larry achieves "happiness" as an itinerant worker, as if that is all
    one should want.

    self' via a renunciation of material rewards, and rather, an inner happiness one
    gets from getting high and listening to music.  He was born of the British gentry
    and so could take status for granted because back then one's class, especially
    in Britain, was not merely a function of one's wealth. I watched the 1984 version
    of

    or connections in America could simply enjoy his transcendent being without material
    success. To think that you can achieve bliss by being a monk doing manual labor
    your whole life is just as dumb as thinking that you can achieve greater glory
    just getting high everyday and listening to music.

    from an evolutionary perspective, because that way people are incented to interact
    and try to be helpful to others, create things others want, and receive material
    rewards for doing so.  Surely, a desire for status can go too far like any desire,
    but to presume you could be a content toll-booth operator  is naive.

    to think the good objective in life is losing one's attachment to things like
    popularity and success. This was really brought back to me reading the existentialists
    and noting how profoundly sad they all were (Schopenhauer, Nietzsche  Kierkegaard),
    because they were really lonely, they didn't have wives or children.  I remember
    reading Henry James telling his brother that his most singular attribute was his
    pronounced loneliness, which as a homosexual in that day must have been really
    tough. We have hard wiring that may not make sense from a logical perspective,
    but we shouldn't dismiss these desires simply because they aren't rational in
    a utilitarian perspective.
