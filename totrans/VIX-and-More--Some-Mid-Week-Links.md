A collection of recent posts that I am still chewing on, still chuckling about, or both:

*   [Ticker Sense](http://tickersense.typepad.com/ticker_sense/) on historical sector P/E ratios, in three parts ([part 1](http://tickersense.typepad.com/ticker_sense/2007/04/historical_sect.html), [part 2](http://tickersense.typepad.com/ticker_sense/2007/04/historical_sect_1.html), and [part 3](http://tickersense.typepad.com/ticker_sense/2007/04/historical_sect_2.html))

*   [Michael Maboussin](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search?q=mauboussin) on the [wisdom of crowds](http://abnormalreturns.com/2007/04/03/diversity-prediction-theorem/), courtesy of [AbnormalReturns](http://abnormalreturns.com/) [](http://abnormalreturns.com/) 
*   [HeadlineCharts](http://headlinecharts.blog.com/) on [new highs and lows, bullish percents, advances and declines, up and down volume, and more](http://headlinecharts.blog.com/1679316/) 
*   Chris Perunna and his [eponymous blog](http://www.chrisperruna.com/) with a different look at the [new high to new low ratio](http://www.chrisperruna.com/2007/04/03/new-highs-new-lows-and-industry-strength/) 
*   Declan Fallon and his [nearly eponymous blog](http://blog.fallondpicks.com/) with his [top ten dividend payers](http://blog.fallondpicks.com/2007/04/top-10-dividend-payers.html) 
*   [Brett Steenbarger](http://www.brettsteenbarger.com/) of [TraderFeed](http://traderfeed.blogspot.com/) with a [collection of links](http://traderfeed.blogspot.com/2007/04/trading-techniques-collection-of.html) on how to trade (one of these weeks I’m actually going to leave Brett of this list, just to show I can do it)

*   [Joshua Bell](http://www.joshuabell.com/) plays a [free concert](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/04/AR2007040401721.html?hpid=topnews) in the Washington DC Metro (tip of the hat to [uglychart.com](http://www.uglychart.com/2007/04/07/2627/))

*   uglychart again, this time on [Nicholas Darvas and less than full disclosure](http://www.uglychart.com/2007/04/11/nicolas-darvas-how-he-made-2000000-writing-a-book/) 
*   …and finally, to complete an uglychart hat trick (a *VIX and More* first,) [this universal stock market report](http://www.uglychart.com/2007/04/10/uglychartcom-daily-market-review-april-10-2007/), which recalls George Carlin’s [hippie dippie weatherman](http://www.georgecarlin.com/media/audio/fmton.html)
