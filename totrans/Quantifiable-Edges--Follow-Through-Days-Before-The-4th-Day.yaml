- en: So it appears that allowing FTD’s on day two did identify one additional rally.
    I looked to see when this additional “success” took place. It was July of 1973\.
    The total rally only lasted 3 weeks. The reason it was “successful” if you entered
    on the FTD on the 2nd day off the bottom was that the “success” target of a move
    of twice the size of the distance from the bottom to the FTD was more easily achieved.
    This “successful” July rally never even went on to break the swing highs of May.
    Not exactly the kind of winner most traders would be disappointed to miss out
    on. And while it met the test definition, when looking at a chart it likely isn’t
    a rally that most traders would even consider successful. Also note that shortening
    the requirement to 2 days from 4 days triggers 8 more losers.

  zh: 因此，允许第二天出现FTD似乎确实识别了一个额外的上涨。我查看了这个额外“成功”发生的时间。那是1973年7月。总的上涨只持续了3周。如果你在底部的FTD上进入，这个“成功”的目标是从底部到FTD的距离的两倍移动。这个“成功”的七月上涨甚至没有突破五月的摇摆高点。并不是大多数交易者会失望错过的赢家类型。虽然它符合测试的定义，但看图表时，它可能根本不是大多数交易者会考虑成功的上涨。还要注意，将要求从4天缩短到2天触发了8个更多的失败者。
- en: I don’t agree with many of IBD’s teachings on FTD’s, but in my eyes this particular
    rule (waiting until day 4) is a very good one. I personally wouldn’t ignore it
    and am a bit surprised that they did.
