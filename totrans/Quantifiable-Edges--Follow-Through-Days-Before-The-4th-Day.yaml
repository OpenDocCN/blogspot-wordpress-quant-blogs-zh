    Since it was only the 2nd day off the bottom this seemed odd to me. I’ve done

    evidence. From all appearances they have done very little actual research on their
    own indicator, and have never shared any verifiable results.

    should occur between the 4th and 10th day of the beginning of a rally. I examined

    claims. In fact, the small sample was much more reliable.

- en: from the January 14, 2008 study I adjusted the requirement from 4 days (standard)
    to 2 days (Wednesday’s “FTD”). Below is a quick comparison since 1970\. Again,
    refer to the original basic assumptions for definitions of success and failure
    of a FTD.

    I looked to see when this additional “success” took place. It was July of 1973\.
    The total rally only lasted 3 weeks. The reason it was “successful” if you entered
    on the FTD on the 2nd day off the bottom was that the “success” target of a move
    of twice the size of the distance from the bottom to the FTD was more easily achieved.
    This “successful” July rally never even went on to break the swing highs of May.
    Not exactly the kind of winner most traders would be disappointed to miss out
    on. And while it met the test definition, when looking at a chart it likely isn’t
    a rally that most traders would even consider successful. Also note that shortening
    the requirement to 2 days from 4 days triggers 8 more losers.

    rule (waiting until day 4) is a very good one. I personally wouldn’t ignore it
    and am a bit surprised that they did.
