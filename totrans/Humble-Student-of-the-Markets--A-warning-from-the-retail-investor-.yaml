    It seems that institutional investors have been consistent size sellers of equities;
    while hedge funds had been sellers since late last year but recently started to
    buy; and individual investors have been buying stocks like they were Black Friday
    door-crasher specials. Bear in mind that when institutions change direction, they
    move glacially but move tends to be long lasting, while hedge fund and retail
    investor money tends to be much more nimble.

    are only to the end of March and the April figures will not be updated for another
    week or so, the readings from IMX also confirms substantial net individual investor

    usually have marked very strong stock markets (think the past 12 months).  The
    catch is once margin debt is high and it ROLLS OVER, then you better start to
