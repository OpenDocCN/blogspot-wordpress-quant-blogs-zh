    contract**. To do so, we created a heatmap with **R**, using the **ggplot2** library.

- en: The original data were downloaded from the internet. They consisted on daily
    closing prices of the 1st nearby London ICE gasoil futures contract from April
    1981 to October 2013\. The monthly returns were computed as ![ln(close_{month}-close_{month-1})](img/149428b2d8340defee79b64b65dcb22c.png).

- en: The **R** code below is straightforward. It can easily be modified to suit specific
    needs and serve as a basis for more advanced graphs. We also show the result.
