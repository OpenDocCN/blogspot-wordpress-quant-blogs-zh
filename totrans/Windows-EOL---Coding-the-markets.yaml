- en: Could Windows die as an enterprise OS? Could it disappear in the same way as
    desktop  workstations from Sun, SGI & Next? Could it vanish from the datacentre
    just like Solaris?

- en: Twenty years ago Open Source advocates pushed the Linux desktop as a means to
    break Microsoft’s stranglehold on PC computing. At the same time Sun promoted
    Java applets as desktop OS agnostic. In reality it was the iPhone launch in 2007,
    and the rise of the smart phone that broke Microsoft’s dominance in the consumer
    space; Android & iOS are the leading phone and tablet OSes and have driven the
    shift from Windows being the primary GUI to HTML5\. But despite the primacy of
    the HTML5 GUI for new systems, Windows position on the corporate desktop still
    seems secure. Why?

- en: 'There are good reasons Windows persists in the business environment when it
    has receded in the consumer space: corporate knowledge workers need desktop computing,
    and Windows is still the best option: cheaper than MacOS, easier to use than Linux
    and more compatible with legacy apps than either. It’s still the best platform
    for running MS Office, naturally. But maybe [ReactOS](http://www.reactos.org)
    – an Open Source Windows clone, could eventually change that. With no license
    fee that makes it cheaper than Windows, so the question becomes: could ReactOS
    form the basis for a RedHat style play that would eliminate desktop Windows in
    the same way RedHat Enterprise Linux finished off Solaris? For that to be happen
    possible ReactOS would need to achieve higher levels of compatibility. Currently
    it can [run a lot of apps including Excel Viewer](https://www.reactos.org/gallery),
    but not Office itself. That could be addressed by industry consortia. How much
    do large enterprises spend on Windows licensing? Potentially, that cost could
    be taken out in favour of funding consortium efforts to raise ReactOS compatibility,
    package it for corporates and supply support.'

- en: It’s an intruiging prospect, but there are good reasons why it would be hard
    to execute. Firstly, the sheer technical difficulty of troubleshooting without
    source code access for MS Office, .Net and other legacy apps. Debugging is a hell
    of a lot easier with source code access. Secondly, Microsoft’s competitive response;
    they could drop the cost of Windows volume licensing to zero or near zero. And
    they could engineer Office and .Net for ReactOS incompatibility. However, both
    responses could invoke resistance from anti monopoly regulators.
