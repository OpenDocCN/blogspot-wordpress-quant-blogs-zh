- en: A desirable goal of relative strength investing or any type of portfolio algorithm
    would be to track the best stock/asset from a group of stocks/assets in hindsight.
    In other words, we wish to use an approach that can “follow the leader.” This
    goal is a close relative of universal portfolio algorithms (see Universal Portfolios
    [http://www.stanford.edu/~cover/portfolio-theory.html](http://www.stanford.edu/~cover/portfolio-theory.html)  that
    seek to track the best pair of  continuously rebalanced stocks/assets in hindsight.
    Typically a “follow the leader” (FTL) algorithm  is used for online optimization
    problems in a variety of fields as it has broad applicability and is superior
    to naaive weighting methodologies. While such algorithms typically use a reward
    and cost/penalty function to moderate the degree to which the leaders (or successful
    algorithms) are successful versus unsuccessful, in this post we will take a simplistic
    approach.

    have invested most of our money in such stocks by following their trends as they
    evolved? The answer to this question is that we must seek to track the winners
    not exclusively on a rolling window basis (like most RS strategies), but rather
    from the inception or start period of our backtest. Furthermore, we must continuously
    monitor the leaders and weight our portfolio according to their cumulative return.
    Finally, to ensure we don’t miss new leaders that start moving during other points
    in the backtest period, we must repeat this process with multiple start dates.
    The CSSA SFTL (“S” stands for simple) algorithm works as follows:'

- en: 4) Use a weighted moving average that weights the oldest periods more than recent
    periods to ensure that we give more weight to tracking the best asset as recorded
    since the beginning of the backtest. ie for this month’s period use a weighted
    average of each of the current weights for all of the recorded inception periods.
    This is the weight applied to each stock/asset. If one was invariant to the best
    asset by inception period, you could use a simple moving average that would not
    favor any one inception period.

    have chosen during the backtest while also providing the opportunity to track
    the best asset from a variety of inception periods. It is a fairly simple but
    stable FTL method that could be developed into something more powerful.
