    for the possibility that it is a valid one and should the Earth enter a cooling
    period, this would be bullish for energy demand and result in higher energy prices.

    back in early June comparing Bill Miller and Ken Heebner, I noted that Ken Heebner
    had a hot hand largely because of his overweight position in resources and underweight
    position in Financials. Moreover, Heebner does not hesitate to turn over his portfolio
    if he thinks that it is positioned improperly.

    Despite the recent rally in Financials and the air pocket hit by Energy, Heebner
    may have trimmed back some of his Energy overweight and is now adding back to
    his position.

    their peak, I believe that the near-term upside and downside price risks are far
    more balanced and would be inclined to be more constructive on the oil price.
    Does that mean that it can’t go down any more? Of course not, there remain substantial
    risks to buying here. However, if you are playing the odds then the probabilities
    are now tilting more in favor of the bulls.'
