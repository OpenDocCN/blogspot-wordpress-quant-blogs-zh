    their backtest performance, but also reduce the real costs of trading. The trend-follower
     will always pay more to enter a trade due to the increased slippage and market
    impact costs. A further “tax” in the modern era across all markets is the effect
    of short-term mean-reversion– as markets tend to follow through less often, a
    trend trade will often be triggered at a short-term high or low. This leads to
    poor entries that constrain the potential for the trade to make a profit. The
    obvious solution to this problem is to incorporate a short-term counter-trend/mean-reversion
    entry and exit within a given trend-following strategy. The key is to use an entry
    that occurs frequently enough to avoid missing trades and gets in as quickly as
    possible. For exits, it is important to have a quick and timely signal, and it
    is also critical to preserve the  nature of trend-following strategies which is
    to reduce tail risk. In other words, we do not want to create an exit into strength
    that may never be filled and leaving the trader faced with a significant drawdown.

    when combining it with a short-term moving average. The value of improving the
    performance of a short-term trend signal cannot be overstated because it allows
    you to better track the trend of the underlying with substantially less lag. As
    the SPY/S&P500 has become fundamentally mean-reverting since 1998, most traders
    have resorted to using longer-term moving averages and trend filters such as the
    200sma or a golden crossover. The problem is that in today’s market– that is rife
    with shocks and unpredictable rallies– the tail risk above the long-term moving
    average has gotten higher.  The cost of lag can mean a nasty drawdown, as has
    been experienced by most trend-followers this year.  If you can more accurately
    follow the short-term trend, you can reduce this risk substantially. Let’s take
    a look at the performance of a short-term trend strategy— buying when the close
    is above the 10-day simple moving average and selling when the close is below
    the sma. The “mean-reversion tax” is quite evident, and the actual trading costs
    with slippage and commission are not even factored in:'

    we will look at a short-term range mean-reversion indicator– the DVB, and set
    it to the shortest period for maximum response which is one period. The indicator
    is normalized so that the frequency of entry/exits is stable, and the DVB in contrast
    to say an RSI requires far less true mean- reversion to change values. In this
    case, we will use the bottom quartile for entry and the top quartile for exit.
    Thus the strategy would be to enter when both the close>10sma but only when DVB1<25,
    and the exit would occur when the close is <10sma but only when DVB1>75\.  Effectively
    we are buying into the first available weakness following a new short-term trend
    and selling into the first available strength once that trend has ended. Remarkably,
    this makes the losing strategy of following the 10sma into a winning proposition:[![](img/01957247d1a7511fdbccb58c30ec8b33.png
    "041")](https://cssanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/041.png)Clearly a substantial
    improvement– not sexy, but it gets the job done. What is most beneficial about
    this strategy is that it is very quick to catch rallies and exit into weakness
    while boosting the % winning trades to 41% from 33%, and boosting the average
    trade from -.09% to .73%. The difference in the two backtests would be even more
    extreme with real-world trading costs. But what about tail risk?  Lets take a
    closer look to see if that has increased:'

    no difference in terms of value at risk (the 5th percentile of daily returns),
    and the worst trade for counter-trend is marginally higher. Looking at the drawdowns,
    we see a much clearer difference– trend following is really risky when you get
    chopped around. The drawdown is almost 3x higher for the conventional strategy.
    This method is robust to moving average length, and appears to improve performance
    universally. While not shown here, even a 200sma strategy is substantially improved
    by such a minor change in entry and exit.'
