- en: It is possible to make minor adjustments to strategies that can both improve
    their backtest performance, but also reduce the real costs of trading. The trend-follower
     will always pay more to enter a trade due to the increased slippage and market
    impact costs. A further “tax” in the modern era across all markets is the effect
    of short-term mean-reversion– as markets tend to follow through less often, a
    trend trade will often be triggered at a short-term high or low. This leads to
    poor entries that constrain the potential for the trade to make a profit. The
    obvious solution to this problem is to incorporate a short-term counter-trend/mean-reversion
    entry and exit within a given trend-following strategy. The key is to use an entry
    that occurs frequently enough to avoid missing trades and gets in as quickly as
    possible. For exits, it is important to have a quick and timely signal, and it
    is also critical to preserve the  nature of trend-following strategies which is
    to reduce tail risk. In other words, we do not want to create an exit into strength
    that may never be filled and leaving the trader faced with a significant drawdown.

  zh: 有可能对策略进行微调，既能提高其回测表现，又能减少交易的实时成本。趋势跟随者由于增加的滑点和对市场影响的成本，始终会支付更高的入场费用。在现代时代，所有市场上的进一步“税收”是短期均值回归的影响——由于市场不再频繁地跟随，趋势交易往往在短期的高点或低点被触发。这导致了不佳的入场，限制了交易盈利的潜力。这个问题明显的解决方案是在给定的趋势跟随策略中纳入一个短期逆趋势/均值回归的入场和出场。关键是要使用一个足够频繁的发生入场，以避免错过交易并尽快进入。对于出场，快速和及时的信号很重要，同时保留趋势跟随策略的性质，即减少尾风险，也至关重要。换句话说，我们不想创建一个可能永远不会成交的强势出场，让交易者面临显著的回撤。
- en: 'The most significant impact of a counter-trend entry exit is typically found
    when combining it with a short-term moving average. The value of improving the
    performance of a short-term trend signal cannot be overstated because it allows
    you to better track the trend of the underlying with substantially less lag. As
    the SPY/S&P500 has become fundamentally mean-reverting since 1998, most traders
    have resorted to using longer-term moving averages and trend filters such as the
    200sma or a golden crossover. The problem is that in today’s market– that is rife
    with shocks and unpredictable rallies– the tail risk above the long-term moving
    average has gotten higher.  The cost of lag can mean a nasty drawdown, as has
    been experienced by most trend-followers this year.  If you can more accurately
    follow the short-term trend, you can reduce this risk substantially. Let’s take
    a look at the performance of a short-term trend strategy— buying when the close
    is above the 10-day simple moving average and selling when the close is below
    the sma. The “mean-reversion tax” is quite evident, and the actual trading costs
    with slippage and commission are not even factored in:'

  zh: 逆趋势入场退场最大的影响通常是在与短期移动平均结合时发现的。提高短期趋势信号性能的价值无法过分强调，因为它让你能更好地跟踪基础资产的趋势，同时滞后程度大幅降低。自1998年以来，SPY/S&P500已经基本呈现出均值回归的特征，大多数交易者已经转而使用较长周期的移动平均和趋势过滤器，如200周期移动平均或金叉。问题是，在当今市场——充斥着意外反弹的市场——长期移动平均以上的尾风险已经变得更高。滞后成本可能导致可怕的回撤，正如今年大多数趋势跟随者所经历的那样。如果你能更准确地跟随短期趋势，你可以大幅降低这种风险。让我们看看短期趋势策略的表现——当收盘价高于10日简单移动平均时买入，当收盘价低于sma时卖出。“均值回归税”非常明显，而且实际交易成本（包括滑点和佣金）甚至还没有考虑在内：

    we will look at a short-term range mean-reversion indicator– the DVB, and set
    it to the shortest period for maximum response which is one period. The indicator
    is normalized so that the frequency of entry/exits is stable, and the DVB in contrast
    to say an RSI requires far less true mean- reversion to change values. In this
    case, we will use the bottom quartile for entry and the top quartile for exit.
    Thus the strategy would be to enter when both the close>10sma but only when DVB1<25,
    and the exit would occur when the close is <10sma but only when DVB1>75\.  Effectively
    we are buying into the first available weakness following a new short-term trend
    and selling into the first available strength once that trend has ended. Remarkably,
    this makes the losing strategy of following the 10sma into a winning proposition:[![](img/01957247d1a7511fdbccb58c30ec8b33.png
    "041")](https://cssanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/041.png)Clearly a substantial
    improvement– not sexy, but it gets the job done. What is most beneficial about
    this strategy is that it is very quick to catch rallies and exit into weakness
    while boosting the % winning trades to 41% from 33%, and boosting the average
    trade from -.09% to .73%. The difference in the two backtests would be even more
    extreme with real-world trading costs. But what about tail risk?  Lets take a
    closer look to see if that has increased:'

  zh: 现在让我们看看同样的策略上的逆趋势重叠。在这种情况下，我们将研究一个短期范围均值回归指标——DVB，并将其设置为最大响应的最短周期，即一个周期。该指标进行了归一化处理，使得入口/出口的频率保持稳定，与RSI相比，DVB改变值所需的真正均值回归要少得多。在这种情况下，我们将使用四分之一最低值作为入口，四分之一最高值作为出口。因此，策略将是当收盘价>10sma但仅当DVB1<25时进入，而当收盘价<10sma但仅当DVB1>75时退出。有效地，我们在新的短期趋势出现的第一个弱点时买入，在该趋势结束时的第一个强度时卖出。令人惊讶的是，这使得跟随10sma的失败策略变得有盈利的可能性：[![](img/01957247d1a7511fdbccb58c30ec8b33.png
    "041")](https://cssanalytics.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/041.png)显然是一个显著的改进——不性感，但能完成工作。这种策略最有益的地方是，它非常快地抓住反弹并退出弱点，同时将盈利的交易比例从33%提高到41%，并将平均交易额从-0.09%提高到0.73%。两种回测之间的差异在现实世界的交易成本中会更加极端。但是关于尾风险呢？让我们仔细看看是否有所增加：

- en: '![](img/e5a34cf6535ba90c298efe851c770cfd.png "003")It seems like there is virtually
    no difference in terms of value at risk (the 5th percentile of daily returns),
    and the worst trade for counter-trend is marginally higher. Looking at the drawdowns,
    we see a much clearer difference– trend following is really risky when you get
    chopped around. The drawdown is almost 3x higher for the conventional strategy.
    This method is robust to moving average length, and appears to improve performance
    universally. While not shown here, even a 200sma strategy is substantially improved
    by such a minor change in entry and exit.'

  zh: '![](img/e5a34cf6535ba90c298efe851c770cfd.png "003")似乎在价值风险（每日回报的第五个百分位）方面几乎没有区别，逆趋势交易的最坏情况略高一些。观察回撤，我们发现趋势跟踪在震荡中真正具有风险，而传统策略的回撤几乎是三倍高。这种方法对移动平均线长度具有鲁棒性，并且似乎普遍提高性能。虽然这里没有展示，即使是200sma策略，通过入口和出口的微小变化也显著改善。'
