- en: This chart is very similar to the same quadrant when looking at the 200/50 test.
    Good follow through was seen when the market was near its highs up until about
    1988\. From 1988-2000 the edge was weaker. Post 2000 is has been non-existent.
    Even the latest bull market from 2003-2007 failed to make much headway when trading
    above these two lines. I noted a few weeks ago that bull market saw little in
    the way of enthusiasm near highs and this is more proof of that.

    this quadrant has generated some nice returns. The shape here is again somewhat
    reminiscent of the 200/50 chart of the same quadrant.

    least amount of time.

    historically – mostly as the market emerges from below. The last two bear markets
    have seen some steep losses from this area, though.

- en: During the 60’s and 70’s this quadrant consistently lost money. Since the mid-80's
    pullbacks into this quadrant have often been buying opportunities. It has suffered
    during the last 2 bear markets. This suggests you're beter of attempting longs
    in this quadrant during a bull market.

    moving average can be a difficult and dangerous endeavor. (See quadrants 3 & 4.)
