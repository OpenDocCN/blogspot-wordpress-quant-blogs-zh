    looked at the recent weakness in the [Dow Jones Transportation Average](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Transportation_Average)
    ([DJTA](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/DJTA)) and included a study
    of the performance of the index relative to the S&P 500 index.'

- en: The chart below, which plots each of the above sub-sector indices as a percentage
    of the DJTA shows that airlines have been the biggest laggard relative to the
    broader transportation average over the course of the past month, while railroads
    and truckers have also not been able to keep pace with the DJTA as of late. The
    relative strength in the transportation sector has come from the marine shippers
    – a point that is bolstered by the recent strength in the [Baltic Dry Index](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Baltic%20Dry%20Index)
    (not shown in the charts.)

    ETFs that are available are the popular Claymore/Delta Global Shipping ETF ([SEA](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SEA))
    and the less active Claymore/NYSE Arca Airline ([FAA](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/FAA)).
