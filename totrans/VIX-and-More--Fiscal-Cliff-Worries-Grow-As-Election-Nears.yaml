    topped the list of investor [fears](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/fear)
    about the stock market for the third week in a row, outpolling the [European sovereign
    debt crisis](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/European%20sovereign%20debt%20crisis),
    which finished a distant second, and U.S. elections, which edged out weak earnings
    for third place.

  zh: 对于美国[财政悬崖](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/fiscal%20cliff)结果的担忧第三次出现在投资者对股市[恐惧](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/fear)的列表首位，领先于排名第二的[欧洲主权债务危机](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/European%20sovereign%20debt%20crisis)和排名第三的美国选举，后者险胜业绩疲软。
- en: With 65% of responses coming from U.S. voters, the poll results were once again
    skewed toward an Americentric perspective. Three weeks into this poll, it appears
    as if geographical and temporal proximity are having a strong effect on respondents.
    For third week in a row, U.S., respondents were much more concerned about events
    in their own country. For example, the fiscal cliff outpolled the European sovereign
    debt crisis by 14.8% in the U.S., while non-U.S. respondents had these two issues
    deadlocked in a tie for first place. Similarly, 13.9% of U.S. respondents cited
    U.S. elections as their top worry, while just 5.3% of non-U.S. respondents placed
    U.S. elections at the top of the list.

  zh: 此次调查65%的回应来自美国选民，因此调查结果再次倾向于以美国为中心的视角。进行这项调查的三周后，似乎地理位置和时间上的接近对受访者产生了强烈影响。连续第三周，美国受访者对其国内事件更加担忧。例如，财政悬崖在美国的投票中领先于欧洲主权债务危机14.8%，而非美国受访者将这两个问题并列第一。同样，13.9%的美国受访者将美国选举列为他们最大的担忧，而只有5.3%的非美国受访者将美国选举列为首选。

- en: Not surprisingly, concerns about a weak earnings season fell sharply over the
    course of the past week, from 18.6% to 9.7%, as most of the critical earnings
    reports are already in the books and the potential for meaningful surprises has
    diminished substantially, as shown in the graphic below.

  zh: 毫不意外，对于一个疲弱财报季的担忧在过去的一周里急剧下降，从18.6%降至9.7%，因为大多数关键的财报报告已经发布，且如下图所示，产生实质性惊喜的可能性已经大幅降低。

- en: With most of the election uncertainty about to be resolved tomorrow, I anticipate
    that the fiscal cliff and the European sovereign debt crisis will once again separate
    from the pack in the next week. Whether this will place upward or downward pressure
    on the VIX remains to be seen.

  zh: 随着明天大多数选举不确定性即将得到解决，我预计财政悬崖和欧洲主权债务危机将在下周再次脱离行列。这将给VIX带来上升还是下降的压力还有待观察。
