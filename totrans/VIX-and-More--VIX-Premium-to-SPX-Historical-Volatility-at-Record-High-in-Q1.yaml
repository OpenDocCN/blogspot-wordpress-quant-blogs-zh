    Normal Range](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/09/vix-and-historical-volatility-settling.html),
    I presented an earlier version of the chart below to explain that in spite of
    the protestations of the time, the relationship between the VIX and [historical
    volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/historical%20volatility)
    (a.k.a. [realized volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/realized%20volatility))
    was actually right in line with historical norms.

    the VIX has been tracking at 177% of the 10-day historical volatility of the S&P
    500 index. This ratio is well above the long-term average of 129% and also above
    the record for a single year – 162% in 1995 – which was back in the time when
    the premium of the VIX over realized volatility in the SPX (“[volatility risk
    premium](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/volatility%20risk%20premium)”)
    was routinely much higher than it has been in recent years.

    of the SPX never crossed above 10.00\. Had the VIX volatility risk premium been
    at the typical historical level of 129%, the VIX would have been below 13.00 for
    this entire period.  Of course, the VIX *never* traded below 13.00 during this
    six-week period.  Instead, investors were unwilling to accept a VIX this low (i.e.,
    drop prices in SPX options) in spite of low realized volatility, which is part
    of the reason (perhaps along with [disaster imprinting](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/disaster%20imprinting)
    and related issues) why the volatility risk premium was at a record high during
    the first quarter.

    increase or the VIX will continue to fall so that the volatility risk premium
    approaches historical norms – and more likely that the future will combine elements
    of both scenarios.

    the volatility risk premium.
