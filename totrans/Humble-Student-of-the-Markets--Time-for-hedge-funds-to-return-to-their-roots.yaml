    William von Meuffling, Crispin Odey, Chris Hohn, even Jim Cramer when he was trading,
    all made out like bandits producing 20-50% returns on the short side in 2000-2002,
    many after having doubled their money by being long in 1999\. This made them look,
    if not like gods, then at least jolly clever and deserving of an investment. Hedge
    fund managers were smart, nimble, slightly less eminent versions of George Soros,
    milking the patsies in the long only community for vast profits. Hugh Hendry would
    come on CNBC Europe and wow us with his acumen and hibboleth-smashing iconoclasm;
    everyone was wrong! Only he could see the truth, it seemed. Chris Hohn would rarely
    have a down month, let alone a quarter, and at the end of the year give half his
    profits away to charity, that was how much he thought of the armani-wearing, white-toothed,
    fake-tanned, long only growth managers whose pockets he was picking. The successful
    hedgies ran maybe $1bn, most ran less, and Andor, the biggest long-short manager,
    ran about $6-7bn.

    indices of various flavors, consultants and HFoFs started pigeonholing everybody
    (once you were a convertible arb fund you had to stay a convertible arb fund,
    even if the opportunities went away), the guerilla got pinned down (not opportunistic)
    and that was the beginning of the end.

    class, unlike other alternatives like real estate. One of the key characteristics
    of an asset class is the ability for an investor to construct a low-cost passive
    index portfolio, with known component holdings and known weights. Hedge funds
    were originally marketed as pure alpha, or portable alpha vehicles with low correlations
    to the major asset classes. These are characteristics that you can’t pin down
    with an index.

    same problems that exist today existed then. Horrible returns, fund blowups –
    these aren’t new inventions. Hedge fund investors found out what they had wasn’t
    a contract with a hedge fund manager, but a call option on a management contract.
    When the incentive fees dried up, the manager packed up and went away.

    and reinvented itself. No doubt we are in for some version of that same story
    going forward.
