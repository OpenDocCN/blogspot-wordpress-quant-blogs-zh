    as counterparties, not computers. And by computers I mean any machine-assisted
    execution, not just HFTs but also the various sorts of execution algorithms. The
    HFTs will (probably) only be in the market when they think an order will make
    money and the execution algo’s are mainly used for moving large quantities of
    stock, so even if the algo isn’t particularly good at its job, it will still make
    for a pretty toxic counterparty. Humans on the other hand I’d expect to be rather
    imprecise with their chosen price (because it isn’t really worth their time),
    even more imprecise with the timing of their orders and cancellations (slowness
    and inattentiveness are part of being human), and be less likely to have plans
    to keep trading in the same direction (otherwise they’d have found somebody to
    help them get a good execution).

    term alpha start by thinking about how to maximize their chances of trading with
    humans. Probably the vast majority of manually submitted orders that ever trade
    are marketable – and first go to internalizers, wholesalers, and dark pools. Then,
    if nobody in those markets finds their terms favorable, they get sent on to the
    major exchanges. There, it’s extremely difficult to selectively trade with the
    small manual orders because of the competitive nature of the FIFO resting order
    queue – in order to pick out a higher proportion of favorable incoming orders,
    a trader has to have previously submitted their resting order before all the machines
    trying to do the same thing. Given how many fast and clever programs that are
    in the market, beating the best of them is very challenging.

    on resting manual orders. To try to identify these orders, we can just think about
    what they are not, HFTs. HFTs are known for their very high cancellation rates,
    meaning the vast majority of orders they send to market are canceled before they
    execute. The below chart from a recent ESMA report shows the order lifetime statistics
    of HFTs, investment banks, and other traders. Note that within 1 second of submission,
    over half of HFT orders have been canceled, but only around a quarter of non-HFTs
    have been. This chart comes from European data, but the general tendency should
    carry over to any market with a high HFT presence.

    at how the market price varies before and after orders of various ages execute,
    from the perspective of each order in question.

    from the perspective of the passive side of the trade. For example 30 seconds
    after a trade, the average Nasdaq order less than 100ms old has lost about 0.2
    cents (20mils) compared to the price of the most recent 100 shares traded. The
    average Nasdaq order greater than 1s old has lost about 0.5 cents by the same
    measure. Fees and rebates are excluded. Data does not include every exchange.
    Bottom panel: Shares traded on Nasdaq vs time from trade (including fiducial trade).
    Note: There is a shaded region 1 standard deviation wide (computed naively) around
    each line, that is too narrow to see. 1 “mil” = 0.01 cents per share.'

    algorithmic trading, a 1/4 cent difference – several times a typical HFT profit
    margin – is significant. It’s a pretty obvious phenomenon, too, and usually when
    an inefficiency is so evident the market will find a way to reduce it. One simple
    application I can imagine is that many liquidity-seeking execution algo’s could
    preferentially trade with older orders, potentially passing on a 1/4 cent cost
    savings to their customers. Of course that doesn’t mean it’s a big enough effect
    to form the basis of a profitable strategy all by itself, but as I’ll describe
    in the [next post](https://mechanicalmarkets.wordpress.com/2015/01/20/identifying-trader-type-pt-2/
    "Creating an HFT Strategy: Identifying Trader Type Pt. 2") it does not take all
    that much effort to make it into one.'
