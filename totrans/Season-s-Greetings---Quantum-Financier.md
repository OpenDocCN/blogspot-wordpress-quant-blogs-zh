During this holiday period, I want to thank you all very much for the support you have showed this nascent blog in 2010\. The good discussions I have had with reader in the comment section or via email made every minute of the adventure worth it. The good feedback I received exceeded every expectations I ever had for the blog and I hope that 2011 will be just as prosperous for the Quantum Financier blog.

Now to you that take time during this time of festivities to read this post, I wish the best for the holiday period and a very successful year trading and evolving with the markets in 2011.

Best,

QF
