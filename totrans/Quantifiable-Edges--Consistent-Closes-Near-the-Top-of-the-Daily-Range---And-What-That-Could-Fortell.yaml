     When the market consistently closes near the high of the day it suggests optimism
    on the part of traders. This end-of-day optimism is now at a level that suggests
    it is a bit overdone and there is a good chance of a pullback. The study below
    was last seen in the 7/5/12 blog and it exemplifies this concept. I have updated
    all of the statistics.

    the edge has been realized over the 1st 2 days.

- en: '*Note: To calculate the “8-day Average Closing % Range” I am simply measuring
    where in the daily range SPY closed each day. For instance if it traded at a low
    of $141.00 and a high of $142.00 and closed at $141.75, then it would have closed
    in the 75th percentile of the daily range. A close at $141.50 would have meant
    50%.**I then take a simple moving average of the last 8 days. If that average
    goes from below 75% (where it usually is) to above 75%, the study is triggered.*'
