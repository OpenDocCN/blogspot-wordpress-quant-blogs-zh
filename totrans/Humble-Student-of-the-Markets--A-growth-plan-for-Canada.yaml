    and stimulate growth. Call that Growth Plan 2.0\. (Incidentally, I believe that
    one of the failures of the Tory campaign is to properly explain why deficits matter.
    The Trudeau plan of borrowing when the market will lend you money at 2% or less
    to invest in growth producing infrastructure is arguably sound.) While Growth
    Plan 2.0 is certainly an improvement over 1.0, the Liberal approach is very Keynesian.
    Though it will undoubtedly provide a short-term boost, it doesn't address long-term
    productivity issues facing Canada.

- en: DARPA’s role is to spur innovation. And we do it by focused, short term efforts.
    We pick things that are not impossible, but also not very low risk. So we take
    very high risk gambles, and those risks have tremendous payoffs. So if we’re successful
    it means that these robots are actually going to be able to make a difference.
    In particular, in disaster scenarios making society more resilient. The lesson
    of the original challenge [DARPA Grand Challenge - driverless cars] is that persistence
    pays. It’s important if you know the technology is almost there and you can sort
    of see the light at the end of the tunnel, a little bit of persistence will pay
    off. What I’m hoping for in the trials is that some of the teams will score some
    points. I don’t think that any team is going to score all the points that there
    are. Maybe no teams will even score half the points that there are. But I think
    some teams will do moderately well. My expectation is that the robots are going
    to be slow. What we’re looking for right now is for the teams to just do as well
    as roughly that one year old child. If we can get there, then we think that we
    have good reason to believe that some of these teams with continued persistence
    for another year will actually be able to demonstrate robots that show the utility
    that these things might have in a real disaster scenario. DARPA is in the innovation
    business, not in the development business. So, what we do is we wait for technology
    to be almost ready for something big to happen, and then we add a focused effort
    to catalyze the something. It doesn’t mean that we take it all the way into a
    system that’s deployed or to the marketplace. We rely on the commercial sector
    to do that. But we provide the impetus, the extra push the technology needs to
    do that.

    challenge is to create clusters of expertise. There is no point in trying to re-create
    Silicon Valley in your own back yard, but you can focus on specific industries
    that are already clusters of expertise in your regions. Examples include autos
    in southern Ontario, aerospace in Quebec, oil service and exploration in Calgary,
    mining in British Columbia and so on.

    prizes aimed at specific problems in targeted industries, e.g. nano materials
    technology for the auto or aerospace industry, to encourage universities to take
    the lead in research. If a breakthrough were to occur, then the existing private-public
    partnership structures already in place at the universities can do the rest. Such
    an approach would be a low-cost way of encouraging innovation that highlight Canadian
    expertise.

    It would create an engineering industry and expertise in the region that would
