- en: I received an interesting note from Dr. Steven F. over the weekend who observed
    the SPY gap open put it above it’s upper Bollinger Band on the gap. For an index
    to gap open outside of its Bollinger Band, price will almost always need to be
    somewhat stretched already. It would seem logical that a gap up into an already
    short-term overbought condition would be a likely candidate for a reversal. I
    decided to test.

- en: The criteria was simple. A gap up over the upper Bollinger Band would signal
    a short entry. The trade would be exited near the close of the day. Looking back
    to 1998 in the SPY I was able to identify 79 such instances. There were 43 (54%)
    winners and 36 losers. The average winner made 0.56% and the average loser lost
    0.50%. The profit factor was a modest 1.34.

    Above the 200-day moving average there have been 62 instances of a gap up above
    the Bollinger Band. Shorting these and covering on the close resulted in 53% winners.
    Winners outsized losers by 0.57% to 0.38%. The profit factor was a decent 1.7\.

    There were 17 instances. Ten winners, but the average loss was 1.0% vs. an average
    gain of 0.5%. Overall a losing strategy below the 200ma.

- en: As with previous gap studies, it appears gaps up in long-term downtrends are
    dangerous to try and short. While it would've worked out on Friday, you always
    need to be wary of a short-covering rally or trend day up.
