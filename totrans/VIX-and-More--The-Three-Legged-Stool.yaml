    and fundamental issues, but this apparently escaped Salmon’s notice as well.

    exclusively with a fundamental approach – and I’m sure there are at least as many
    investors who have prospered mightily using only technical analysis.  Part of
    the reason investors gravitate to one approach or the other is that it fits their
    personality and provides a certain level of comfort.

    or technical analysis is one’s investment [time horizon](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/time%20horizon).  In
    a nutshell, the shorter the time horizon, the more important technical analysis
    becomes.  Find me a day trader, for instance, that invests primarily based on
    fundamental factors.  One the flip side, find me a chartist who is looking at
    monthly charts covering more than a decade who does not think it is important
    to be educated on some of the relevant fundamentals that are driving the long-term
    price action.

    of technical analysis and analysis of [market sentiment](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/sentiment)
    (which I consider to be tangential to TA), informed by a broad view of stock and
    industry fundamentals, in the context of a larger macroeconomic environment and
    interrelated global markets.  Ultimately, it’s a three-legged stool, with TA,
    market sentiment, and fundamental analysis providing a balanced perspective.

    surprise that my [subscriber newsletter](http://vixandmoresubscriber.blogspot.com/)
    covers a much broader range of topics than is generally touched upon in the blog.  The
    reasons for this are simple.  All the talking heads talk about macroeconomics
    and fundamentals all day long.  There are also a number of blogs and other web
    sites that spend a lot of time analyzing charts and other TA data.  I choose to
    focus on market sentiment on the blog because I don’t believe this subject gets
    nearly the attention it deserves.  Those who understand volatility, put to call
    ratios, market breadth data, and other related subjects and who can combine that
    information with a fundamental + technical approach have a much greater chance
    of success than those who ignore market sentiment.

    incorporate a broad range of themes, because I believe it is important to see
    the whole playing field and not to have any investing blind spots.  The approach
    seems to be working, as I have a 98% renewal rate and am in the process of writing
    a book on the subject, slated to be published by [Wiley Trading](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/Section/id-300231.html)
    in the first half of 2009.*
