    5.8 percentage points among the 15-24 year olds, by 3.5 points among the 25-34
    year olds and by 1.8 points in the 35-64 age range. Qualitatively, the profile

    rate among 15 to 24 year olds in the first quarter of 2012 was 8%; in Italy it
    was 34.2%, in Spain 50.7% and the euro area average was 21.9%. These trends reflect
    a fundamental question: they confirm the particular vulnerability of this essential
    part of our workforce. ***The unequal sharing of the “cost of flexibility”, only
    affecting young people, an eternal flexibility with no hope of stabilisation,
    leads among other things to companies not investing in young people, whose skills
    and talents often decline in jobs with low added value.*** The underuse of their
    resources reduces growth in various ways: it makes the creation of start-ups less
    likely – and they are on average more innovative than others – it causes a decline
    in skills in the long run, slowing down the assimilation of new technology and
    acting as a brake on efficient production processes. ***In addition to undermining
