    *The Registered I/O Networking Extensions, RIO, is a new API that has been added
    to Winsock to support high-speed networking for increased networking performance
    with lower latency and jitter. These extensions are targeted primarily for server
    applications and use pre-registered data buffers and completion queues to increase
    performance.*'
