- en: Yesterday’s post, [St. Louis Fed’s Financial Stress Index](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/09/st-louis-feds-financial-stress-index.html),
    generated a great deal of interest in what I like to call the [STLFSI](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/STLSFI).

    of the STLFSI and the VIX during the 2008 Financial Crisis and up through the
    present.

- en: The chart below zooms in on the previous 1993-2010 timeline and highlights the
    STLFSI and VIX since the beginning of 2007\. Keep in mind that the data is weekly
    (the STLFSI is only updated once per week) so some of the nuances are lost. Still,
    some conclusions are unavoidable. For instance, the STLFSI appears to have done
    a better job than the VIX of flagging the deteriorating economic situation from
    the end of 2007 to September 2008\. Additionally, the STLFSI indicates that extreme
    stress in the system in late 2008 persisted longer than the VIX would have investors
    believe. Finally – and perhaps most relevant to the current situation – the VIX
    has almost completely discounted the May 2010 volatility spike some four months
    later, whereas the STLFSI suggests that the events of May, which were highlighted
    by the [European sovereign debt crisis](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/European%20sovereign%20debt%20crisis),
    still cast a large shadow on the current state of the markets.

    indicator.
