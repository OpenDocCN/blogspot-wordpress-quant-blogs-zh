    your hand if you were following were watching the Bombay [Sensex](http://stockcharts.com/charts/gallery.html?%24bse)
    for clues about the future of the [Chinese market](http://stockcharts.com/charts/gallery.html?fxi)
    or were wise to the unwinding of the [Yen](http://stockcharts.com/charts/gallery.html?%24XJY)
    carry trade before it happened.  Maybe you were tipped off to the [subprime mortgage
    debacle](http://stockcharts.com/charts/gallery.html?new).  If so, you did a better
    job than most investors.'

    on the VIX would have guaranteed that you found yourself on the right side of
    the markets on 2/27, but it would have helped.  Careful study of the [equity put
    to call ratio](http://www.schaeffersresearch.com/streetools/market_tools/cboe_eqpcr.aspx)
    would also probably have helped.

    default swaps.  I know, I’m not a bond guy either, but keeping an eye on how the
    markets are pricing default risk (the spread versus the [US Treasury yield curve](http://stockcharts.com/charts/YieldCurve.html))
    is somewhat of a bond analog for how equity risk is priced in with the VIX.'

    bonds.  A [snapshot](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=%5EDJCDXH) of this index is
    available at [Yahoo](http://www.yahoo.com/), but much more information is available
    through [Markit](http://www.markit.com/information/affiliations/cdx.html) (click
    on the *Dow Jones CDX.NA.HY* link to pull up the graph below).  Note that in the
    high yield graph, the market discounted 1/3 of the risk premium from September
    to Feburary and is now going through wild gyrations in an effort to re-price the
    risk premium to better match current expectations.

- en: I should also note that while [StockCharts.com](http://stockcharts.com/) does
    not provide charts for the high yield credit default index, they do offer charts
    for a sister index, the [investment grade credit default index](http://stockcharts.com/charts/gallery.html?%24djcdxni),
    whose weekly chart I have included below.  The IG index chart suggests that the
    recent turmoil in the bond markets is less than what transpired during the May-July
    sell-off of last year and does little to reverse the 20 month trend of increasingly
    narrowing credit default spreads.

    to help call market tops and bottoms.  It can’t hurt to have several canaries,
    each with their own unique sensitivities.
