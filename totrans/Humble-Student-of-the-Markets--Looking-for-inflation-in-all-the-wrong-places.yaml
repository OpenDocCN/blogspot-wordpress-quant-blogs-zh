    of inflation, a voting bloc of hawks (Waller, Bostic, Barkin, and Bowman) on the
    FOMC may be a key obstacle to the market expectations of a June rate cut. Indeed,
    Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic reiterated his view last week of one rate
    cut in 2024 and the first cut should occur in Q4.

    FOMC. On one hand, Fed Chair Powell has said that January and February PCE reports
    represent a bumpy path to the Fed’s 2% inflation target, hawks such as Governor
    Waller have raised concerns about the persistence of inflation and asked, “What’s
    the hurry [to cut rates]?”

    cuts for 2024 in his dot plot projection, which is a surprise as he has been regarded
    as a dove. Moreover, he stated that if inflation continues to move sideways, it
    raised doubt as to whether the Fed should cut at all. Minneapolis Fed President
    Kashkari also revealed that he wrote down two rate cuts for 2024, and also openly
    wondered if the Fed needs to cut if progress on inflation stalls.

    three cuts this year?

- en: As a reminder, the Fed targets headline PCE as its main inflation metric. Both
    headline and core PCE rose in January and February after a series of tame readings
    in late 2023\. The key question that concerns Fed officials is the last mile inflation
    question. How persistent is inflation and what’s the path to the 2% target? Investors
    may gain some insights from the FOMC meeting minutes, which are due to be released
    in the coming week.
