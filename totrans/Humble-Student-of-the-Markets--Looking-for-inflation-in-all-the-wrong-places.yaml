- en: Last week, I suggested that even though Fed Chair Powell voiced a balanced view
    of inflation, a voting bloc of hawks (Waller, Bostic, Barkin, and Bowman) on the
    FOMC may be a key obstacle to the market expectations of a June rate cut. Indeed,
    Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic reiterated his view last week of one rate
    cut in 2024 and the first cut should occur in Q4.

  zh: 上周，我提到尽管美联储主席鲍威尔对通胀表达了平衡的观点，但FOMC中的鹰派投票集团（沃勒、博斯蒂克、巴克金和鲍曼）可能是市场预期6月降息的关键障碍。事实上，亚特兰大联储主席拉斐尔·博斯蒂克上周重申了他对2024年降息一次的看法，首次降息应在第四季度发生。
- en: Based on the speeches of Fed speakers, a divide of opinion is appearing in the
    FOMC. On one hand, Fed Chair Powell has said that January and February PCE reports
    represent a bumpy path to the Fed’s 2% inflation target, hawks such as Governor
    Waller have raised concerns about the persistence of inflation and asked, “What’s
    the hurry [to cut rates]?”

  zh: 根据美联储发言人的讲话，FOMC中出现了意见分歧。一方面，美联储主席鲍威尔表示，1月和2月的个人消费支出(PCE)报告代表了美联储2%通胀目标的一条崎岖道路，像州长沃勒这样的鹰派提出了关于通胀持续性的担忧，并问道，“急于降息有什么
    hurry？”
- en: As well, Chicago Fed President Goolsbee revealed that he wrote down two rate
    cuts for 2024 in his dot plot projection, which is a surprise as he has been regarded
    as a dove. Moreover, he stated that if inflation continues to move sideways, it
    raised doubt as to whether the Fed should cut at all. Minneapolis Fed President
    Kashkari also revealed that he wrote down two rate cuts for 2024, and also openly
    wondered if the Fed needs to cut if progress on inflation stalls.

  zh: 此外，芝加哥联储主席古尔斯比透露，他在点阵图预测中写下了两笔2024年的降息，这令人惊讶，因为他一直被视为鸽派。此外，他表示，如果通胀继续横盘整理，它使人们怀疑美联储是否应该降息。明尼阿波利斯联储主席卡什卡里也透露，他在2024年的降息记录上写下了两笔，并公开表示，如果通胀进展停滞，美联储是否需要降息。

- en: As a reminder, the Fed targets headline PCE as its main inflation metric. Both
    headline and core PCE rose in January and February after a series of tame readings
    in late 2023\. The key question that concerns Fed officials is the last mile inflation
    question. How persistent is inflation and what’s the path to the 2% target? Investors
    may gain some insights from the FOMC meeting minutes, which are due to be released
    in the coming week.

  zh: 作为提醒，美联储将 headline PCE视为主要通胀指标。在2023年底的一系列温和读数之后，1月和2月的headline和core PCE均有所上升。美联储官员关心的问题是最后的通胀里程。通胀有多持续，以及如何达到2%的目标？投资者可以从下周发布的FOMC会议纪要中获取一些洞察。
