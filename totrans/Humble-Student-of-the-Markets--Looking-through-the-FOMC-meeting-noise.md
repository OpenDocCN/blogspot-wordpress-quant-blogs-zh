**Mid-week market update**

: It is always to discern short-term market direction on the day of an FOMC meeting, but a number of trends have developed that can support a short-term risk-on tone.

The most notable is the possible change in leadership. For quite some time, the trends of US over global stocks, growth over value, and large caps over small caps have been the leadership in the past bull market. I am starting to see signs of possible reversals.

In the past, changes in market leadership have marked market bottoms, and the emergence of new bull markets. This interpretation comes with the important caveat that leadership changes are usually necessary, but not sufficient conditions for major bullish reversals.
