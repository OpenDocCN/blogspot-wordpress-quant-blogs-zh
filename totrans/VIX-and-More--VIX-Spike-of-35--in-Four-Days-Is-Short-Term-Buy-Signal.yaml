    spike in the VIX, today’s action seemed like a good excuse to revisit the idea
    of [VIX spikes](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20spikes) as contrarian
    bullish [mean reversion](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/mean%20reversion)
    buying opportunities.

- en: Today the VIX closed at 27.91, which is up 34.9% in the four trading days since
    Thursday’s close of 20.69\. Over the course of the 20 year history of the VIX,
    the volatility index has posted close-to-close four day gains of 35% on 42 occasions.
    If you strip out the consecutive instances of +35% days, this leaves 27 instances
    in which the VIX crossed above +35% in four days. I have reproduced the full table
    of these 27 instances below for several reasons. First, the key takeaway is that
    from a timing perspective, a long SPX position entered after a 35% spike will
    generally perform best over the course of a five day time horizon. In the graphic
    below, the 27 instances average a five day gain of 1.99% vs. a typical five day
    SPX return of 0.14%, for a 1.85% net differential. While the net differential
    peaks at five days, it is apparent in just one day and persists for at least fifty
    trading days.

    a few of the returns are at the tail end of the distribution and are highlighted
    in green and red. In particular, this contrarian long strategy did an excellent
    job of timing the bounces off of the lows during the [Asian financial crisis](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Asian%20financial%20crisis)
    in 1997, the [Russian financial crisis](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Russian%20financial%20crisis)
    and [Long-Term Capital Management](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Long%20Term%20Capital%20Management)
    crisis in 1998, the [9/11 World Trade Center attacks](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/9%2F11)
    in 2001, as well as the technology bottom following the [WorldCom](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/WorldCom)

    surprise that the four long signals from September and October 2008 turned out
    to be disasters in the 20-100 day time frame. Over the course of a 3-10 day time
    horizon, however, these were excellent short-term trading opportunities from the
    long side. I do wish to point out, however, that if one strips out the last four
    rows of the tables, suddenly the 100 day time frame has a return of 6.86%, which
    is 2 ½ times that of the baseline (“census”) return. The obvious conclusion is
    that the VIX spike buy signal is quite reliable for the short-term, but not as
    reliable for over longer time frames. This is the key take away from the table
    and the reason I included the full data set. The secondary conclusion is that
    VIX spikes are generally good long setups as well, but here the risk is that it
    precedes a once in a generation or two meltdown that erases a decade or more of
    returns.

    it is important to consider that all it takes is one rogue GDP number to throw
    a monkey wrench into an attractive set of statistics. Tomorrow should be interesting
    – and I expect the bulls will be putting a great deal of capital to work no matter
    how the GDP data falls.
