    or even about the indebtedness of the entire currency bloc. After all, Greece
    represents only 2.5 percent of the eurozone’s gross domestic product (GDP), and
    the bloc’s fiscal numbers are not that bad when looked at in the aggregate. Its
    overall deficit and debt figures are in a better shape than those of the United
    States — the U.S. budget deficit stood at 10.6 percent of GDP in 2010, compared
    to 6.4 percent for the European Union — yet the focus continues to be on Europe.

    history but in American history. This is the period between the successful Revolutionary
    War in 1783 and the ratification of the U.S. Constitution in 1788\. Within that
    five-year period, the United States was governed by a set of laws drawn up in
    the Articles of the Confederation. The country had no executive, no government,
    no real army and no foreign policy. States retained their own armies and many
    had minor coastal navies. They conducted foreign and trade policy independent
    of the wishes of the Continental Congress, a supranational body that had less
    power than even the European Parliament of today (this despite Article VI of the
    Articles of Confederation, which stipulated that states would not be able to conduct
    independent foreign policy without the consent of Congress). Congress was supposed
    to raise funds from the states to fund such things as a Continental Army, pay
    benefits to the veterans of the Revolutionary War and pay back loans that European
    powers gave Americans during the war against the British. States, however, refused
    to give Congress money, and there was nothing anybody could do about it. Congress
    was forced to print money, causing the Confederation’s currency to become worthless.

    led by Daniel Shays in 1787\. Shays’ Rebellion was, at its heart, an economic
    crisis. Burdened by European lenders calling for repayment of America’s war debt,
    the states’ economies collapsed and with them the livelihoods of many rural farmers,
    many of whom were veterans of the Revolutionary War who had been promised benefits.
    Austerity measures — often in the form of land confiscation — were imposed on
    the rural poor to pay off the European creditors. Shays’ Rebellion was put down
    without the help of the Continental Congress essentially by a local Massachusetts
    militia acting without any real federal oversight. The rebellion was defeated,
    but America’s impotence was apparent for all to see, both foreign and domestic.

- en: The current political and security architectures of Europe — the EU and NATO
    — were encouraged by the United States in order to unify the Continent so that
    it could present a somewhat united front against the Soviet Union. They did not
    grow organically out of the Continent. This is a problem because Moscow is no
    longer a threat for all European countries, Germany and France see Russia as a
    business partner and European states are facing their first true challenge to
    Continental governance, with fragmentation and suspicion returning in full force.
    Closer unification and the creation of some sort of United States of Europe seems
    like the obvious solution to the problems posed by the eurozone sovereign debt
    crisis — ***although the eurozone’s problems are many and not easily solved just
    by integration, and Europe’s geography and history favor fragmentation***.

    decided "never again". In the 200 years preceding that war, Europe had been wracked
    by conflict (WW II, WW I, Franco-Prussian War, Napoleonic Wars) and the main source
    of conflict was between France and Germany, or the Germanic states before their
    unification. When Western Europe said "never again", they devised a solution that
    bound the French and the Germans so tightly that the devastation of war on the
    European Continent would be stifled, hopefully forever. That solution was the
    EC, which became the EEC and now the EU.
