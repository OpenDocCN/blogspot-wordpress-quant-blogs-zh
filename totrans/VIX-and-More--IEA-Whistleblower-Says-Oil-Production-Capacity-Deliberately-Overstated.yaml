    concerned about [Peak Oil](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Peak%20Oil)
    long before I took on the VIX a pet project. Now that I occasionally find myself
    as an unofficial source of all things VIX and volatility, it seems I am also perpetually
    on the lookout for storm clouds on the horizon.

    Oil. In [Key Oil Figures Were Distorted by U.S. Pressure, Says Whistleblower](http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/nov/09/peak-oil-international-energy-agency),
    Terry Macalister reports that the International Energy Agency (IEA) has been deliberately
    publishing overly optimistic oil production capacity data, largely due to arm
    twisting by the U.S. government. Macalister quotes two different unnamed IEA sources,
    including one who assesses the situation as follows:'

    a day by 2030 although it was forced to reduce this gradually to 116m and then
    105m last year. The 120m figure always was nonsense but even today''s number is
    much higher than can be justified and the IEA knows this. Many inside the organization
    believe that maintaining oil supplies at even 90m to 95m barrels a day would be
    impossible but there are fears that panic could spread on the financial markets
    if the figures were brought down further. And the Americans fear the end of oil
    supremacy because it would threaten their power over access to oil resources.”*'

    which it was “imperative not to anger the Americans.” Speaking about the current
    state of oil production, he added, “We have [already] entered the ''peak oil''
    zone. I think that the situation is really bad.”'

    question here is whether the quotes from above are the complete truth or merely
    mostly truthful. If I were looking to predict future disaster scenarios, Peak
    Oil would be near the top of my list. The question here is not if, but when –
    and what sort of ugly political and economic consequences will be intertwined
    with Peak Oil.

    but a slow-motion train wreck is hardly an improvement – and often turns out to
    be more painful to watch.
