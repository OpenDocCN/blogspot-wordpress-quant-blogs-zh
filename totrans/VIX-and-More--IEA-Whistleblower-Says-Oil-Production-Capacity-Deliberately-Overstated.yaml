    concerned about [Peak Oil](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Peak%20Oil)
    long before I took on the VIX a pet project. Now that I occasionally find myself
    as an unofficial source of all things VIX and volatility, it seems I am also perpetually
    on the lookout for storm clouds on the horizon.

    Oil. In [Key Oil Figures Were Distorted by U.S. Pressure, Says Whistleblower](http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/nov/09/peak-oil-international-energy-agency),
    Terry Macalister reports that the International Energy Agency (IEA) has been deliberately
    publishing overly optimistic oil production capacity data, largely due to arm
    twisting by the U.S. government. Macalister quotes two different unnamed IEA sources,
    including one who assesses the situation as follows:'

  zh: 根据[卫报](http://www.guardian.co.uk/)的报道，一个确定无疑的赌注是石油顶峰。在[关键的石油数据被美国压力扭曲，吹哨人说法](http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/nov/09/peak-oil-international-energy-agency)中，特里·麦克阿里斯特报道，由于美国政府的施压，国际能源署(IEA)故意发布了过于乐观的石油生产能力数据。麦克阿里斯特引用了两个不同且未具名的IEA消息来源，包括一个评估情况如下的人：
- en: '*“The IEA in 2005 was predicting oil supplies could rise as high as 120m barrels
    a day by 2030 although it was forced to reduce this gradually to 116m and then
    105m last year. The 120m figure always was nonsense but even today''s number is
    much higher than can be justified and the IEA knows this. Many inside the organization
    believe that maintaining oil supplies at even 90m to 95m barrels a day would be
    impossible but there are fears that panic could spread on the financial markets
    if the figures were brought down further. And the Americans fear the end of oil
    supremacy because it would threaten their power over access to oil resources.”*'

  zh: '*“IEA在2005年预测，到2030年，石油供应量可能会达到每天1.2亿桶，尽管它被迫逐渐将这一数字从1.16亿桶降至去年的1.05亿桶。这个1.2亿桶的数字一直都是胡说，但即使今天的数字也比可以证明的数字高得多，IEA也知道这一点。该组织内部许多人认为，即使将石油供应量维持在每天9000万至9500万桶也将是不可能的，但人们担心，如果进一步降低数字，金融市场可能会出现恐慌。而美国人担心石油霸权的结束，因为这会威胁到他们对获取石油资源权力的控制。”*'
- en: '*A second IEA source attributes much of the unrealistic data to a culture in
    which it was “imperative not to anger the Americans.” Speaking about the current
    state of oil production, he added, “We have [already] entered the ''peak oil''
    zone. I think that the situation is really bad.”'

- en: Now I take everything I read with a grain of salt, but I think the important
    question here is whether the quotes from above are the complete truth or merely
    mostly truthful. If I were looking to predict future disaster scenarios, Peak
    Oil would be near the top of my list. The question here is not if, but when –
    and what sort of ugly political and economic consequences will be intertwined
    with Peak Oil.

  zh: 现在我对所读的一切都持有一丝怀疑，但我想这里的重要问题是，上述引语是完整的真相，还是仅仅是大部分真相。如果我在寻找预测未来的灾难场景，石油顶峰会是我名单上的头号人物。这里的问题不是是否，而是何时——以及与石油顶峰交织在一起的政治和经济后果会有多丑陋。
