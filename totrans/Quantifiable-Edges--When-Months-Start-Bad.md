# Quantifiable Edges: When Months Start Bad

After shooting higher to begin the month the previous few months, the market decided to throw a curveball in June. These first two days have been a fairly rough start. I decided to see how SPY has historically reacted when the month got off to a bad start. For purposes of the test I shall define “bad start” as a down close the first 2 days and a loss of at least 1.5% over those two days.

Going back to 1993 I found 14 occurrences. Here are their stats over the next week:

Also notable is the fact that all 14 closed higher than the trigger day at some point over the next week.

Tough to put too much stock in a seasonal-type study like this one. (They are my least favorite from a trading perspective.) Still, combined with some other positives I’m seeing, such as

and last week’s

[volume study](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2008/05/volume-pattern-that-makes-huge.html)

, I’m inclined to believe we may see some upside sometime in the next few days.
