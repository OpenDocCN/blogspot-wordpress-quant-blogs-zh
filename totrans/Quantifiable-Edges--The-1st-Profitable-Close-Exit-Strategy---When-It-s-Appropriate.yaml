    close” exit. For many traders, a “first profitable close” exit may seem like nothing
    more than a ploy to inflate the winning % of the system and not an appropriate
    exit technique to put into practice.

    is appropriate and effective. “2 Days In Chop” is one of those cases. Recall the
    premise of the system was based on taking advantage of the extremely choppy market
    conditions that had been identified. It’s those choppy conditions that make the
    1st Profitable Close strategy viable.

    back and forth, the expectation is for that chop to persist. This would suggest
    a move in the direction of the trade is more likely to be reversed than to follow
    through. So with a system like “2 Days in Chop”, the expectation flips as soon
    as the trade becomes profitable. Since a reversal is more likely than continued
    follow through the correct play is to take the quick profit.

    / mean reverting system in a choppy environment. In a different environment, or
    if trading a breakout system, an exit strategy that looks for quick profits would
    be a disaster.

    would include using a short term oscillator and waiting for that oscillator to
    revert back to a neutral state, or using a short-term moving average (such as
    a 5-day) and then exiting the trade on a cross of the moving average.
