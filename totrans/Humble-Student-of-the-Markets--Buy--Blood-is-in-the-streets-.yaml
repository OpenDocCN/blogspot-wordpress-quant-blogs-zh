- en: The Trend Model is an asset allocation model which applies trend following principles
    based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. In essence, it seeks
    to answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish)
    or contraction (bearish)?"

- en: Well, the stock market certain took a fright last week! At this point, we have
    to ask ourselves the question of how worried should we be about the market outlook.

    you need the money next month, next quarter or next year? If you need the money
    in such a short period, then did your asset allocation reflect those circumstances?
    I would contend that as your anxiety level should be falling as your time horizon
    lengthens.
