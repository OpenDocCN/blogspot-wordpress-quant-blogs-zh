    (one measure I use is granger based).   I was interested in knowing to what extent
    if  A ↔ B ↔ C implies a weak A ↔ C, where am using ” ↔” to indicate granger causes
    in either or both directions.

    very rough analog to observe the falloff in correlation as one progresses farther
    along the relationship path.   So if one has a graph of “directs” from A with
    associated correlations to A, what are the correlations of  the directs directs
    back to A, and so on:'

    prove anything directly about causality, but seems to imply that  transitivity
    is limited or near non-existant or at least falls off very quickly.
