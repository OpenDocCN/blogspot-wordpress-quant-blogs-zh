    to hear any chatter about the VIX ETN, [VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX).
    Though admittedly not as sexy or as volatile as its index counterpart, VXX still
    managed to fall over 40% from its February high on the way to making a new all-time
    intraday low of 71.96 today, before rallying late in the session to finish the
    day with a gain of 1.32% and a close of 77.38.

- en: What really got my attention, however, was today’s new record volume of 825,338
    shares. Since VXX is less than four months old, traders are still getting up to
    speed on some of the [VXX’s idiosyncrasies](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/04/lost-in-translation-vxx-and-vxz.html).
    Given that VXX cannot be shorted (at least in my accounts), there was very little
    in the way of speculative interest in this product while volatility was cratering
    over the course of the past 2 ½ months.

- en: The key takeaway, however, is that today there was a record number of bets on
    volatility using VXX. I suspect I am not the only one who thinks we probably just
    saw a [VIX bottom](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/05/where-will-vix-bottom.html).

- en: Today may also have been the first indication that VXX has the potential to
    be a superb speculative vehicle in addition to a hedging tool. With an average
    intraday range of almost 5% and daily change approaching 3%, VXX could even join
    the ranks of the triple ETFs as a preferred day trading vehicle. The VIX still
    has a long way to go before it becomes a staple of the trading community, but
    today was definitely a big step in that direction.
