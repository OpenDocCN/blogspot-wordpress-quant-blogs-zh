    If the American capitalists want to make more money, they still have to invest
    in new technology, and they still need an increasingly educated workforce. But
    now, because of globalization, they can get that workforce anywhere in the world.
    You can think of this as arbitrage: China doesn’t have that many college graduates
    as a proportion of its population, but they come cheaper than American college
    grads. Or you can think of it as free riding: if China (or Korea, or India, or
    Brazil, or anywhere else) is willing for whatever reason to invest in increasing
    the number of domestic college graduates, the American capitalists can simply
    expand their operations over there and save themselves the trouble and expense
    of investing in the American educational system. (And for China, the returns on
    investment in education might be higher than the returns for America, because
    the marginal productivity of new investments in education is probably higher.)
