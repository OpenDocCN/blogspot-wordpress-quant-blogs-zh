    blog was InterOil ([IOC](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/IOC)). The
    stock was trading just over 22 when I [highlighted it](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/07/individual-stock-volatility-interoil.html)
    back in July 2007, but what got my attention was that it had stratospheric [implied
    volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/implied%20volatility)
    (IV) and [historical volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/historical%20volatility)
    (HV) readings that were both above 150\. “This is a keg of dynamite,” I proclaimed
    at the time, in what was probably an understatement. Within a month of my post,
    IOC traded as high as 42.00 and as low as 18.37 as speculation raged on the nature
    and extent of IOC’s oil and gas exploration efforts in Papua New Guinea. In 2008,
    the battle between bulls and bears continued in earnest with implied volatility
    in triple digits for most of the year and the financial crisis pushing the stock
    down as low as 8.90 after a pop to 41.62 earlier in the year.

    consecutive world record natural gas discoveries were logged and high profile
    investors such as George Soros and T. Boone Pickens took large positions in the
    company. With the story slowly unfolding, the stock ran all the way up to the
    70s and made a high of 84.05 at the beginning of the current month.

    coming out of Papua New Guinea, the stock continues to be a Rorschach test of
    sorts, trading on pure investor emotion and momentum a good deal of the time.

- en: The chart below, courtesy of [Livevol](http://www.livevol.com/), captures two
    years of the stock price history (top chart, with 50 day moving average in red
    and 200 day moving average in purple), as well as two years of 20 day historical
    volatility (blue) and 30 day implied volatility (red). There are quite a few interesting
    data points on this chart. One that I find particularly interesting is that IV
    has remained relatively flat since June 2009, even though the stock tripled from
    that level. The last month or so has seen a steady uptick in both IV and HV, perhaps
    foreshadowing the recent 26% drop and perhaps indicating that even more fireworks
    lie ahead. Historically, IOC’s HV has had trouble topping its IV, but one big
    news item can change that picture in a hurry.
