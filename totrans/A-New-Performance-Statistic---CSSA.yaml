    had a very good idea for a performance metric. The following was take from the

- en: “hi , you just inspired me to create a new metric DVFE based on the fractal
    efficiency of the equity curve. perfect efficiency would imply that the curve
    had no wasted movement, and although short-term profit spikes would be somewhat
    penalized (nonetheless this is desirable as a profit spike is generally transient
    and the result of an extreme market regime)–typical upside movement would not
    be penalized. to calculate this metric one would have to use a continuous equity
    curve and a fixed bet methodology to avoid a lognormal curve that would distort
    results.An adjustment is also made for the number of trades which is useful to
    help avoid rewarding strategies with very few trades.

  zh: “嗨，你刚刚激发了我创造一个基于权益曲线的分形效率的新指标DVFE的灵感。完美的效率意味着曲线没有浪费的运动，尽管短期利润暴涨会受到一定程度的惩罚（尽管这是可取的，因为利润暴涨通常是短暂的，是极端市场环境的结果），但典型的上行运动不会受到惩罚。要计算这个指标，必须使用连续的权益曲线和固定的投注方法，以避免会扭曲结果的对数正态曲线。还对交易数量进行了调整，这对于避免奖励交易次数很少的策略是有用的。

- en: This new performance statistic helps overcome many of the drawbacks of the DVR
    which can penalize upside volatility. Theoretically, the DVFE says that if something
    is going up 100% in a perfect straight line, that is more desirable than something
    that is going up 10% in a perfect straight line. This makes logical sense…..though
    I would always look at the DVR as well since upside volatility is a useful indicator
    of how much something could fall when a strategy or stock breaks down. There is
    little question that proportionately the stock that goes up 100% in a straight
    line will likely fall farther and faster than the stock that is going up 10% in
    a straight line.

  zh: 这个新的绩效统计法有助于克服DVR的许多缺点，后者可能会惩罚上行波动。理论上，DVFE表示，如果某样东西以完美的直线上升100%，那比以完美的直线上升10%更可取。这是合乎逻辑的……虽然我总是会关注DVR，因为上行波动是一个很有用的指标，用来衡量策略或股票出现问题时可能下跌的程度。毫无疑问，以完美的直线上升100%的股票很可能比以完美的直线上升10%的股票更快更远地下跌。
