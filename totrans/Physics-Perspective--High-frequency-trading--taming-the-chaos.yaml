    attention to some very good points made in a recent speech by Andrew Haldane of
    the Bank of England. For anyone interested in further details, you can read the

- en: I may not get around to writing a detailed analysis of the third part, which
    focuses on possible regulatory measures to lessen the chance of catastrophic Flash
    Crash type events in the future. But the ideas raised in this part are fairly
    standard -- a speed limit on trading, rules which would force market makers to
    participate even in volatile times (as was formerly the case for market makers)
    and so on. I think the most interesting part by far is the analysis of the recent
    increase in the frequency of abrupt market jumps (fat-tail events) over very short
    times, and of the risks facing market makers and how they respond as volatility
    increases. I think this should all help to frame the debate over HFT -- which
    seems extremely volatile itself -- in somewhat more scientific terms.
