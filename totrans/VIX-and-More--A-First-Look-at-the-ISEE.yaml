    and while the [ISE web site](http://www.iseoptions.com/marketplace/statistics/sentiment_index.asp)
    has a nice little [graph of the ISEE](http://i104.photobucket.com/albums/m163/bl82/ISEE031607.gif)
    going back a year, it is probably not sufficient to answer even the more casual
    questions about the usefulness of the index.  Fortunately, the ISE has data going
    back to October 2002 available to download so that you can conduct your own analysis…or
    you can just keep reading.

    of put to call ratios to help call market turns.  If you want to do some research
    on this indicator, a good place to start would be [Bill Rempel](http://www.billakanodoodahs.com/)’s
    “[The Significance of the Equity Put to Call Ratio](http://www.marketthoughts.com/z20050728.html)”
    commentary at [MarketThoughts.com](http://www.marketthoughts.com/index.html).

    sentiment indicator and suggest that a good place to do so is the [SchaeffersResearch.com](http://www.schaeffersresearch.com/)
    page that graphs the [CBOE equity (non-index) put to call ratio](http://www.schaeffersresearch.com/streetools/market_tools/cboe_eqpcr.aspx).  You
    can create your own CBOE put to call charts at [Stockcharts.com](http://stockcharts.com/)
    using [$CPCE](http://stockcharts.com/charts/gallery.html?%24cpce) as the equity
    put to call ticker, [$CPCI](http://stockcharts.com/charts/gallery.html?%24cpci)
    for the index put to call ticker, and [$CPC](http://stockcharts.com/charts/gallery.html?%24cpc)
    for the total equity + index data.

    and puts in which a customer is opening a position through the ISE itself.  For
    more details and a testimonial of sorts I recommend a [Wall Street Journal article](http://www.iseoptions.com/market_data/ISEE_WSJ_110705.pdf)
    by Mohammed Hadi.

    going back to 2002.  They show a mean of 154, with obvious extreme readings falling
    conveniently at round numbers: below 100 and above 200.  As a contrarian indicator,
    a reading of 100 or below is a good cutoff for overly bearish sentiment and a
    high likelihood of a bullish move ahead; 200 signals extreme bullishness and an
    increased chance of a bearish turn in the markets in the near future.  In many
    respects, a high ISEE number is a lot like a low VIX number and vice-versa.'

    that I will come back to regularly in this space, but for now I have posted a
    graph of the SPX and the 10 day SMA of the ISEE for the period 10/1/02 to 3/19/07.  Note
    that the four largest spikes in the ISEE all preceded significant moves down in
    the SPX; also, low ISEE readings frequently marked the beginning of bullish moves.

    last thought:  the lowest 10 day SMA ever recorded for the ISEE was an 87.00 last
    Thursday.'
