# hacking NASDAQ @ 500 FPS: Looking for a Trading Crew

> 来源：[http://hackingnasdaq.blogspot.com/2012/05/looking-for-trading-crew.html#0001-01-01](http://hackingnasdaq.blogspot.com/2012/05/looking-for-trading-crew.html#0001-01-01)

Have met quite a few people over the last 9 months from a wide cross-section of the trading eco-system. From stressed traders, to hardcore techies, to hardcore WOW players looking to reduce latency! Yet at this point in time, I need more experience/mentors/infrastructure to accelerate my progress.

Looking for a lean and mean group (or individual) that`s cool with remote and wants my trading to be successful.

What can I offer?

- 100% dedicated self starter, "gets shit done", no supervision needed

- Full front to back UHF/HF strategy life cycle

*   Idea
*   Research
*   Backtest
*   Implementation
*   Trading

- Code almost anything

*   CPU codez  (assembler/C/C++/scripting)
*   GPU codez (CUDA/OpenCL/DirectX/OpenGL)
*   FPGA codez (Verilog)
*   Anything Embedded ...fixed point eh?
*   Anything Network Layer1 - Layer7
*   Anything high performance

- Maintain/hack/own anything with electricity

*   Network Infrastructure (cisco/arista config)
*   Server Infrastructure (linux anything)
*   Trading Systems (Front/Back/Middle)
*   Historical System (Market Data/BackTest/Analysis)
*   Strategies (Trade/Research/Tweek)
*   Playstation3 (Design/Build/Deploy/Config/Hack)
*   Coffee Pot (Order/Ack/Fill/Cancel/Panic)
*   etc etc .. 

I learn like a sponge, work like a dog and looking for a group to trade with long term.

NOTE: Can only do remote or remote+travel
