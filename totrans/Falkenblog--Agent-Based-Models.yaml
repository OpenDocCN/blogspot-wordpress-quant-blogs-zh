    regulators works with the Fed, the IMF, and the whole kitchen sink of regulatory
    bodies out there. He seemed like a veteran speaker, and made an interesting analogy
    between investment markets and warfare, in that the only thing that maintains
    is the competition, not the means.

    Bookstaber said these are better than value-at-risk (VAR) involves agent based
    models, because ''anything that works is obsolete.'' Clearly this is an exageration
    (I hope).'

    demand, and that demand decreases in price, mixed with a variety of exogenous
    assumptions such as that noise trade demand is 'weakly mean-reverting', and informed
    demand is a stepwise linear function of the asset price and some constant. This
    is all like Stephen Wolfram's

    vaguely like some asset time series, which given the number of parameters (20+)
    and rules is rather simple. What this implies about the current state of Bank
    of America is anyone's guess. A complex financial company will have hundreds of
    very different assets, each with their own underwriting criteria, loss curves,
    recovery rates, and then several different types of liabilities. VAR isn't relevant
    here, but neither are agent based models.

    and input-output matrices. These generated a lot of excitement, Nobel prizes,
    but were ultimately useless for predicting anything except tenure decisions. VAR
    is a very useful tool, mainly in making sure crazy rogue traders aren't operating,
    but mark-to-market books are not the essence of banking. When I was head of capital
    allocations at KeyCorp, our VAR risk was about 1% of our total economic risk capital,
    almost nothing. Surely it's higher for the money center banks, but it's still
    small compared to their balance sheets that aren't being churned.

    me as a monumental waste of time, up there with the idea that neural nets can
    discover interesting (as opposed to merely true) theorems. On the other hand,
    they are going to do something, and irrelevant is merely a waste of their time
    and money.

    something they simply have to maintain given the contagion risk. Why not keep
    it simple, and just say, you pay an asset tax for every dollar over $100B? Then
    you don't even have to force anything, just collect the extra revenue on the big,
    fat companies that probably would be worth more to their investors (as opposed
    to CEOs) if they were smaller too. Remember, Bob Rubin

    but we all know the Treasury will be there if they collapse. If all the banks
    were smaller, we wouldn't be so afraid of contagion risk (who cares if KeyCorp
    fails?). Banks would be better incented to be prudent investors, and do things

    Further, this way we can focus on what's really important, like which Boston-based
    financial conglomerate will win the Barney Frank sweepstakes this November and
    snag the Dodd-Frank author to their executive committee, winning them a 10 year
    regulatory pass and signaling to everyone on Capital Hill how the game is played.
