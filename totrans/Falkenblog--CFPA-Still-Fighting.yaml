    covered by existing agencies. I'm all for replacing old objectives with new ones,
    but no one is proposing shutting down the old agencies, just adding this new one.
    Thus, the picture below is misleading, because it is merely adding another set
    of lines the the spaghetti graph at the bottom. I have found merely one 'dotted
    line' reporting function to be a disaster within large organizations, and with
    our financial regulation just about every law has multiple agencies enforcing
    it, leading to everyone and no one being in charge.
