- en: While I tend to shy away from talking too much about intraday moves in the VIX,
    today has been an unusual day in the VIX.

- en: First, for most Fridays and particularly before long weekends, you should expect
    the VIX to be (a little more than 1.0%) lower than usual due to what I refer to
    as [calendar reversion](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/calendar%20reversion),
    when options are repriced with the assumption of lower volatility in advance of
    several non-trading days.

    green.

- en: What is particularly interesting, however, is how the VIX has surged since about
    1:00 p.m. ET. In the one minute intraday chart below, note the steady rise in
    the VIX over the course of the last hour or so, while the SPX has essentially
    moved sideways.

- en: The action in the VIX could portend a rocky last hour or two or perhaps indicate
    that traders are becoming more concerned about holding long positions over the
    holiday weekend. Keep an eye on the VIX – and the weakness in real estate ([IYR](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/IYR))
    and financials ([XLF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/XLF)).
