# Timely Portfolio: Life on the Big International Frontier

> 来源：[http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2012/10/life-on-big-international-frontier.html#0001-01-01](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2012/10/life-on-big-international-frontier.html#0001-01-01)

Although I have used the [Kenneth French data library extensively](http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html) in [various posts](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/search/label/french), I have not yet used the international data sets paired with the wonderful paper.

> Eugene F. Fama and Kenneth R. French (2012) "Size, Value, and Momentum in International Stock Returns", *Critical Finance Review*

To rectify this home bias, let’s generate some efficient frontiers for the biggest cap stocks by geographic region to see how the frontiers have evolved over the last 20 years.

Eventually, I would like to think through some other methods of comparing risk, return, and weights across multiple frontiers.
