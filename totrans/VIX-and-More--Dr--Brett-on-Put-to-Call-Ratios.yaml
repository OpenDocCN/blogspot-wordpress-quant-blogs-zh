    like [Brett Steenbarger](http://www.brettsteenbarger.com/) saved me a post on
    the [abnormally low put to call ratios](http://traderfeed.blogspot.com/2007/03/bearish-equity-put-call-ratio-what-to.html).

    [SentimenTrader.com](http://www.sentimentrader.com/) apparently has a more in-depth
    discussion of the put to call issue.  I should add that I am not a subscriber
    to SentimenTrader, but have had it on my To Do list for a couple of months.

    [link to the ISEE](http://www.iseoptions.com/marketplace/statistics/sentiment_index.asp)
    at the upper right hand corner of this blog last week.  The ISEE is a sentiment
    index (in this case, a ratio of call to put options, multiplied by 100) compiled
    by the [International Securities Exchange](http://www.iseoptions.com/about/company/company_history.asp)
    or ISE.  In some respects, it is similar to the [put to call ratios at the CBOE](http://www.cboe.com/data/IntraDayVol.aspx),
    but without the heavy institutional action in the indices that tends to dominate
    the activity on the CBOE.

    low readings, including consecutive all-time lows (data go back to 2002) in the
    10 day SMA last Wednesday and Thursday.
