# VIX and More: More Turkey Anyone?

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/11/more-turkey-anyone.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/11/more-turkey-anyone.html#0001-01-01)

It is the last week in November, so naturally all our thoughts are turning to the BCS and Turkey ([TUR](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TUR)). Here I mean not Barclays and the bird, but the [Bowl Championship Series](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowl_Championship_Series) possibilities and the [emerging market](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/emerging%20markets).

As the chart below shows, anyone who has focused on Turkey not just as a seasonal play but a long-term holding has been nicely rewarded over the course of the past year, as Turkey has outperformed broader emerging markets ETFs like [EEM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EEM) by 5x. As captured in the chart, over the past month or so the performance advantage of TUR has begun to narrow. This could mean it is time to take profits and it could also spur the enterprising investor to go back for a second helping. Either way, I suggest that as 2011 approaches, investors make sure to look at emerging markets at least as a portfolio side dish, if not at a main course.
