- en: An accumulating body of empirical research has found positive gross excess returns
    from exposure to factors (or risk premia) such as Value, Momentum, Low Size (small
    firms), and Low Volatility stocks. The studies show that these factors historically
    have improved return-to-risk ratios. Today, interest in risk premia (also known
    as smart beta or alternative beta) has been widespread across the institutional
    investor community.

    returns only come from risk (in theory). But then, they also 'improve return-to-risk
    ratios', because, as we all know, these factors aren't risk in any obvious way,
    so strangely they all have 'excess return' premia. Indeed, 'value and size were
    initially thought to be due to distress risk, which would show up only episodically.
     Alas, 'quality' is basically an metric of anti-distress, and this generates a
    return premium, which MSCI occasionally calls a 'risk premium'...so basically
    whatever asset outperforms over the next 20 year period will

    current financial academics and their coterie.  They still say interesting things
    on occasion, so it doesn't render them useless, but it definitely impairs their
    ability to see and interpret reality.
