- en: Since the dawn of VIX data, which extends back to 1990, the VIX has shown a
    tendency to move in cycles of 2-4 years that I refer to as [VIX macro cycles](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20macro%20cycles).

- en: The chart below shows six distinct VIX macro cycle periods of declining, rising
    or flat volatility. For now I have assigned a letter to each period, but at some
    point I may go back and name each of them, describe the various influences on
    volatility during the period and set about establishing a fundamental and technical
    basis for classification.

    2007 to November 2008 as the official endpoints of the most recent period of rising
    volatility. As of December, we are in a new VIX macro cycle. While the first few
    months of this new volatility era showed a dramatic decline in volatility, I suspect
    that volatility will flatten out relatively soon, as was the case when the volatility
    spikes of 1994 and 1998 ushered in a period of relatively flat volatility.

- en: Note from past volatility spikes that the initial snap back to lower levels
    of volatility typically last from 4-6 months after peak volatility. If this pattern
    were to be repeated once again, then I would expect volatility to put in a new
    bottom in no more than the next 2-3 weeks.

- en: Guessing where volatility will find a new plateau is not easy, but for now I
    am establishing a provisional bottom of 30\. Ultimately, I would not be surprised
    if I move the bottom down to somewhere in the 25-27 range, but there is a lot
    of work to be done before that much fear and volatility can be driven from the
    collective investor psyche and markets are able to establish a degree of comfort
    with the various financial and economic institutions that will shape the major
    events and policies of the next few years.
