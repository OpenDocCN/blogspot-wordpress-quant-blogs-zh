# Humble Student of the Markets: September uncertainties

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2017/09/september-uncertainties.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2017/09/september-uncertainties.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models**

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post,

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The

**Trend Model**

is an asset allocation model which applies trend following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or contraction (bearish)?"

My inner trader uses the

**trading component**

of the Trend Model to look for changes in the direction of the main Trend Model signal. A bullish Trend Model signal that gets less bullish is a trading "sell" signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading "buy" signal. The history of actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of the trading model are shown by the arrows in the chart below. Past trading of the trading model has shown turnover rates of about 200% per month.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Buy equities*
*   Trend Model signal: Neutral*
*   Trading model: Bearish*

** The performance chart and model readings have been delayed by a week out of respect to our paying subscribers.* **Update schedule**

: I generally update model readings on my

on weekends and tweet mid-week observations at @humblestudent. Subscribers will also receive email notices of any changes in my trading portfolio.

**September headwinds and tailwinds**

Welcome to September. Looking forward, this month is known to be seasonally bearish. Jeff Hirsch of

[Trader`s Almanac](http://jeffhirsch.tumblr.com/post/164571206193/september-worst-month-of-the-year)

found that September was the worst month of the year, based on seasonal factors.

Ryan Detrick of

[LPL Financial Research](https://lplresearch.com/2017/08/31/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-september-but-were-afraid-to-ask/)

further dissected past September seasonality. While while returns have been negative, he found a silver lining. When the SPX is trading above its 200 dma, which it is today, the market has seen positive average returns, though the percentage positive is still below 50% at 47.9%.

That said, investors face a sea of uncertainty as we head into September. I have never known the market to perform well under conditions of high uncertainty, but consider the hurdles ahead:

*   Legislative uncertainty over the debt ceiling and tax reform
*   Geopolitical uncertainty over North Korea
*   Uncertainty over Fed actions

Can stock prices climb the proverbial wall of worry in September, or will it retreat and test its correction lows seen in August?
