    — and stocks with the lowest risk produced the highest returns.” In other words,
    he says, “the risk/return ratio was upside down ... the payoff to risk is consistently
    negative over the 45-year period of this study.”

    still is a risk premium! This inconsistency is necessary because they can''t wean
    themselves from the utility theory that leads inexorably to the risk premium.
    That is, as long as utility is an increasing function of wealth, at a decreasing
    rate, you get a risk premium! So, they basically all have this localized risk
    loving, but global risk aversion. To paraphrase Benjamin Franklin, such a utility
    function is ''so convenient a thing since it enables one to find or make a reason
    for everything one has a mind to do.'''
