    financial instability that benefit the best connected, and consistently easy credit

    ago we have basically flat earnings-a fully employed male today earns on average
    about $800 less, adjusted for inflation- than a fully employed male earned a generation
    ago. The only way that houses could increase or families could increase their
    household income was to put a second earner into the workforce, and, of course
    that’s now flattened out because there aren’t any more people to put into the
    workforce. So you’ve got, effectively, flat income in this time period with rising
    core expenses; housing; health insurance; child care; transportation, now that
    it takes two cars to get everywhere, two jobs to support; and taxes, because you’ve
    got two people in the workforce and we have a somewhat progressive taxation system.
    So that families are spending a lot more on what you describe as the basic nut.

    as a people, what can we do to support the middle class. You know that’s what
    FHA was to help people get into homes, right? VA, GI loans on education, we looked
    at policies, like whether or not they strengthen and support the middle class.

    class instead became like a resource to be pulled from, and you know, they became
    the turkey at the Thanksgiving dinner. Who could who could carve off a piece?
    Who can get this little piece? Who could make a profit from this piece and that
    piece or squeeze down on the wages? And the middle class has gotten shakier and
    shakier, hollowed out.

    what makes us who we are***. It affects the poor. A strong and vital middle class
    is a middle class that can offer a helping hand to the poor. A strong and vital
    middle class is a middle class that has room, is creating new jobs to basically
    to suck the poor up out of poverty and into middle class positions. ***The middle
    class is what gives us political stability.*** It’s what gives us an America that’s
    all bought into the whole process that what we do is not just about a handful
    of folks at the top who profit from it. We all profit from it, and that’s why
    we work, and that’s why we vote, and that’s why we accept that the outcome of
    elections. And that’s why we’re safe to walk our streets, because we have a middle
    class for which this ultimately works, this country.
