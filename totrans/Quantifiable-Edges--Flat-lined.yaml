- en: After shooting up 3.5% last Tuesday the S&P 500 has flat-lined. The chart might
    make you think there was a takeover announced last Tuesday morning of all 500
    components. Volume has dropped each day as well.

- en: I looked back over the last 30 years for similar price action. The only other
    time the market followed a gain of 3% or more with 3 consecutive closes within
    0.25% of the close of the 3% day was December 3, 1982\. By lowering the requirement
    of the surge day from 3% to 0.75% I was able to get a larger sample size. A summary
    of those instances is in the table below.

    appears to be a slight upside edge when this occurs.

    the coiling action to occur above the 10-day moving average.

- en: Again, slightly better than random over the 1st three days. Nothing to exciting
    here, but another small hint at higher prices.
