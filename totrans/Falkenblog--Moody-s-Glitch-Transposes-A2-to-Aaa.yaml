    anyway? Is it better, or worse, than A1? Aaa? When John Moody left S&P to start
    his own firm, he had to create a new scale, so S&P kept the more intuitive AAA,
    AA+ scale while Moody came up with his wicked nomenclature.

    in their computer code. 'Several' means 'more than 3, but not many'. Let's say
    5\. So five notches lower is A2\. Nice, as Borat would say.

    Even in 2005, these things had AAA ratings but 200 basis point spreads to Treasuries,
    while regular AAA debt had only a 20 basis point spread. Great opportunity, you
    might ask? Well, no. Moody's rates things based on an expected loss methodology.
    It puts collateral through scenarios, and notes the various trigger points that
    cause structures to collapse, in calculating the expected loss of various senior
    notes from these pools of collateral. That is, the expected loss on a AAA rated
    note on a pool of B rated credit is highly nonlinear, accounting for the fact
    that AAA pieces often have zero losses until several barriers are breached.

- en: But Moody's is consistent, and so, the expected loss on these AAA rated senior
    pieces should be the same as the expected losses on all AAA rated debt, if they
    ran their models correctly. Now, one can imagine the market, due to illiquidity,
    might gives these things a 20 or 40 basis point premium, but 200? That's the market
    saying 'your models are wrong', which was, in effect, the absence of S&P and Fitch
    also said.

    4.9%). So being off by several notches is material, because it goes from a 'notch'
    to a 'grade', which is discernible intuitively.

    would be not to. But this would leave one pretty catatonic. We rely on things
    everyday we don't understand, like how an airplane flies, or how my prescription
    drugs work, or even how my brain tells me to do something. And so we rely a lot
    of brand names and the reputation for integrity and thoroughness they represent.
    Thus, a hit like this should be very costly to Moody's, but that suggests the
    solution is endogenous, in that it should be in Moody's self-interest to correct
    this error.
