    ET, then ticked down to 30.00 just after the close and inched back up to 30.24
    by the time the index trading session closed at 4:15 p.m.

    Friday just before Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy.

    days. This far surpasses the previous record of 49 days in a row from 1998 as
    well as the 47 day string of 30+ closes from 2002.

- en: About the only useful historical comparison for extended volatility comes from
    [1987](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/1987)-1988, where data reconstructed
    for the [VXO](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXO) (‘original VIX’
    calculations) show that the ‘original VIX’ would have remained above the 30 level
    for 86 consecutive days – about half of the current period of heightened volatility.

- en: To put the 30 level in the VIX in a different perspective, it may be helpful
    to consider that from March 2003 to August 2007, the VIX did not close above 30
    at all. From April 2003 to August 2007, the VIX failed to even reach the 30 level
    on an intraday basis.

    mark for the VIX for an entire calendar year. The low VIX for 2001? Just 18.74.

    tomorrow.
