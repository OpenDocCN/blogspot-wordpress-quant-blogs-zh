    of 40% of pretax income for housing related costs. Of course, the homeowner has
    the "flexibility" of paying more than the minimum interest payment each month
    in order to reduce principal. This financing "innovation" not only gets around
    the federal government's rules around mortgages, but creates a entire new profit
    opportunity for lenders.

- en: For lenders, the HELOC business offers some degree of protection because the
    lines are secured (depends on your loan-to-asset ratio and how "real" your asset
    estimates are), floating rate (offloads interest rate risk to the borrower) and
    because of the demand loan nature of the credit line (just don't shout fire in
    a crowded theatre). Should the Canadian RE market tank, what happens to these
    "lucrative" lines of businesses and the "geniuses" who allowed the lending institution
    to plunge headlong into HELOCs?

  zh: 对于贷款人来说，HELOC（家庭净值资金信贷账户）业务相对来说有一定的保护，因为这些信用额度是有担保的（取决于您的贷款资产比率以及您的资产估值有多“真实”），是浮动利率的（将利率风险转嫁给借款人），并且由于信用额度的需求贷款性质（只是不要在拥挤的剧院里大声喊火）。加拿大房地产市场一旦崩盘，那么这些“利润丰厚”的业务和那些允许放贷机构全力进军HELOC的“天才”会发生什么？
