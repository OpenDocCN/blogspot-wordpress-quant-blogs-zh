    Who in their right mind would say OK, Yes, then, when told they are about to paste
    4000 records say 'no'? Why not simply ask us 100 times if we are sure, because,
    you never know, and it's all about protecting the user from himself. I spend more
    time trying to disable Microsoft protection, than fighting unauthorized users
    or viruses.
