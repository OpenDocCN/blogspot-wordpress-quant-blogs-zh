    leverage Finite State Machines (FSM) and Event Sourcing to solve various financial
    problems.¬† It‚Äôs thus nice to read what other people are doing in a similar space.¬†
    Although old, Ruminations of a Programmer, has an interesting read on the use
    of Akka coupled with Event Sourcing and FSM.¬† What‚Äôs even better is that the [posting](http://debasishg.blogspot.co.uk/2012/01/event-sourcing-akka-fsms-and-functional.html)
    provides an example from a Trade perspective üôÇ¬† Debasish has a [presentation](http://phillyemergingtech.com/2012/system/presentations/debasish_ghosh-phillyete-12.pdf)
    from the Emerging Technologies For The Enterprise [conference](http://phillyemergingtech.com/2012/sessions/building-applications-with-functional-domain-models-event-sourcing-and-actors)
    that provides further reading.

    solution to the problem of¬† globally distributed events.¬† Leveraging the [command-model](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html)

    achieved over a reliable transport.
