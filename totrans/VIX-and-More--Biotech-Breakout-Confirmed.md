> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/07/biotech-breakout-confirmed.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/07/biotech-breakout-confirmed.html#0001-01-01)

Further to my [Biotech on a Tear](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/07/biotech-on-tear.html) post earlier this week, today’s action confirms that [biotechnology](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/biotech) stocks are officially breaking out.  The chart below is a weekly chart of [IBB](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/IBB), the most active of the biotechnology ETFs.  It shows the ferocity of the biotech move over the course of the past month, even in the face of recent [disappointing news on the Alzheimer’s front](http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/elan-wyeth-sink-alzheimers-study/story.aspx?guid=%7BE71A1E1E%2D2DA5%2D4BFC%2DB09E%2DEE38964D9AB9%7D&siteid=yhoof) that battered Elan ([ELN](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=eln)) and Wyeth ([WYE](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=wye)).

Factoring in today’s 3% gain, IBB is set to close at a level not seen since the end of 2001.  Note also that the candlestick patterns for the previous highs made in 2004, 2006, and 2007 all show a significant reversal pattern during the week in which those highs were made.  With one more day in the week and a large buffer, the current chart pattern is likely to print a bullish pattern for the full week, in addition to the new high.

If you want to see what is hot in the biotech world, the sortable [biomedical sector list](http://www2.barchart.com/sectors.asp?sort=3&sec=medical%7E-%7Ebiomedical.sec&level=2&title=) at [Barchart.com](http://www2.barchart.com/) is a good place to start.
