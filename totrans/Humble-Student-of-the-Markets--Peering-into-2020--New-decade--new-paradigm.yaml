    contraction (bearish)?"

    last 15 years (blackline). Not only is the NDX dominating the market, the NDX
    has also been steadily beating the equal-weighted NDX (green line), indicating
    that large caps within that index have outperformed small caps. The bottom panel
    also shows the relative performance of large cap technology (black line) and small
    cap technology (green line) against their respective indices. Both have led the
    market in the past decade.
