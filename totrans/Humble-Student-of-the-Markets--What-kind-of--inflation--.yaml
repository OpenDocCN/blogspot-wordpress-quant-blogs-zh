    too much debt, massive wealth destruction, a weak American consumer and high unemployment,
    which restrains labor’s bargaining power, makes a case for a re-run of the Japanese
    Lost Decade experience highly likely. In the face of these deflationary pressures,
    the classic macroeconomic solutions of fiscal and monetary stimulus are not going

    in that the US and global economies remain weak, and inflation doesn’t really
    show up very much in the official statistics watched by central bankers. Moreover,
    competitive quantitative easing by world central banks may not, in the short run,
    show up in the currency markets at all and the downside in the US Dollar may be
