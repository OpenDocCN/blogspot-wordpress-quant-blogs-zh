    The initial comment was deleted, but reaction comments, almost all rebuking the
    comment, stayed on the website. Someone at Fox News, reading the comments on the
    deleted comment, assumed that it was a legitimate meme though it was merely proffered
    by a lone commenter. Somehow this made it to Fox News anchor E.D. Hill, who noted
    on air that some 'in the media' considered the fist bump a terrorist fist jab,
    though she was the first to bring this to the attention of the world. Then people
    reacted to her reaction, and the idea that 'some people' consider this a 'terrorist
    fist jab' was born.
