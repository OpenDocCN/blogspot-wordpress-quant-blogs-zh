    sectors, countries or regions, or market factors. The charts are organized into
    four quadrants. The typical group rotation pattern occurs in a clockwise fashion.
    Leading groups (top right) deteriorate to weakening groups (bottom right), which
    then rotates to lagging groups (bottom left), which changes to improving groups
    (top left), and finally completes the cycle by improving to leading groups (top
    right) again.

    and they are located in the bottom half of the chart. By contrast, value styles
    such as dividend growth, high quality, large cap value are ascendant.

    sectors, such as technology, communication services, and consumer discretionary
    stocks are in the bottom half, indicating weakness. By contrast, defensive sectors
    such as healthcare, utilities and consumer staples are strong.

    not unusual to see defensive sectors become the sector leaders during a market
    pullback. Once the bulls regain their footing, the high beta sectors can regain
    their footing and lead the market upwards again. On the other hand, the emergence
    of defensive and value leadership can be a signal of a regime shift where the
    bears are slowly taking control of the tape.
