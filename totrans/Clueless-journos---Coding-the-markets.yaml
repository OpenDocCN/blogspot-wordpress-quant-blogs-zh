    really need pointing out. Anyone with two brain cells to rub together will figure
    it out like this: read a newspaper article on your specialist subject, notice
    that the author has failed to do even the most basic research and ask the most
    obvious questions, then realise that the same must apply to pretty much everything
    else in the paper.'

    Hilton](http://www.gordonpoole.com/speakers/AnthonyHilton.htm) commented on 'Big
    banks deadly game'. He mentions Enron, points out that they had a dealing room,
    and then asserts that we're now surrounded by Enrons, in the shape of the global
    investment banks, which of course, all have dealing rooms. He goes on to say "the
    big banks make between half and three quarters of their profit from dealing, and
    that no one from the outside can tell how they do it, or what their business really
    is".

    to [Taleb](http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/). So let's spell it out for Hilton,
    since he seems not to understand what a dealer is, depsite his long and distinguished
    journalisic career. A dealer offers liquidity to the market by quoting prices
    to buy and sell a range of financial instruments in trades up to a certain size.
    I work for a dealer that supplies liquidity to the European government bond markets,
    among others. By standing ready to buy or sell EuroGovies in large amounts, my
    employer makes it possible for pension funds and insurers to take or unwind positions
    in EuroGovies at any time. They also make it possible for European governments
    to conduct treasury operations smoothly – for instance borrowing to finance government
    spending by issuing new debt. Dealers play a critical role in the smooth running
    of market economies.

    traders. No doubt he's confused about a lot else too.
