    of the Subscriber Letter. March was a terrific month for the Letter.

    Subscriber Letter. This is simply a listing of trade ideas. Past performance is
    not necessarily indicative of future results. March may turn out to be the best
    month ever.

    position in the same security on at the same time. If the method calls for scaling
    in, it is most commonly done in up to 3 parts.

- en: Subscribers also receive intraday updates on many open trade ideas. The intraday
    updates are not reflected in the overall statistics. For instance, I sent out
    an update on the XLV and PPH trades above on the morning of 3/7 when they gapped
    up. It indicated that certain targets had been reached and traders could consider
    exiting these trades prior to the Monday open when the “official” exit prices
    would be determined. Both trades were profitable at the time of the update. A
    similar scenario occurred with a few stock trades during March as well, where
    late-day selloffs and gaps down caused hits to the official stats, while many
    subscribers were able to fare much better.
