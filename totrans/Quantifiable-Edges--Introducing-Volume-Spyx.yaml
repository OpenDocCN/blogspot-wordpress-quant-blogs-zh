- en: Over the Summer I developed a volume-based indicator that I decided to call
    Volume Spyx. I have been watching it closely ever since and have posted several
    studies to the subscriber letters associated with Volume Spyx. Essentially, it
    looks at an array of securities and compares their volume. Spyx readings are calculated
    for the NYSE (and compared to the S&P 500) and for the Nasdaq. I primarily use
    it on daily charts, but weekly have also tested well, and there even seems to
    be some edge using intraday bars. What I found is that in general, high Volume
    Spyx readings suggest a bullish bias and low Volume Spyx readings suggest underperformance
    or a bearish bias.

- en: While volume Spyx can be used to help establish a trading bias on its own, Spyx
    tend to show larger edges when used in conjunction with price movement or other
    indicators. Below is a study from last night’s Subscriber Letter which demonstrates
    how I might use Volume Spyx in my analysis.

    is especially true when they occur on an up day. There have only been 2 instances
    where the S&P 500 Volume Spyx has come in under 40 and the market has gained 5%.
    Therefore I loosened the parameters to a 3% gain.* [![](img/2ce3ad0c847b95541ee1771fd1daaf44.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiz0-S0DMsKQb_kKvQmRYbFIBU5lD9KqwsaEBzsOxI5DVUKwzsJqavy9bvMow20ua0Pfi86QaRhLRmq6qEa2J0XBDK-aqF8jlT6aYPJKwTvl9PyGWnUBx4cQBP63Yo7s6N1nVeH979Akrw/s1600-h/2008-11-25+vol+spyx+study.PNG)*Still
    the number of instances is low, but a low Volume Spyx combined with a price spike
    higher has been a bad combination. Below are the 7 instances and their 2-day returns:*
