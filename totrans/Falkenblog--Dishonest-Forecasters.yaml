    'complex-systems theory' can predict prices seems like a neat trick. His website
    notes a lot of press coverage, including Nature and the Wall Street Journal. Wikipedia
    states that 'complex systems theory' is "used as a broad term encompassing a research
    approach to problems in many diverse disciplines including anthropology, artificial
    intelligence, artificial life, chemistry, computer science, economics, evolutionary
    computation, earthquake prediction, meteorology, molecular biology, neuroscience,
    physics, psychology and sociology." A theory of everything indeed.

- en: A professor forwarded me some econophysics paper he co-authored that he thought
    was a paradigm shifter. It was basically some model that generated chaos, with
    some positive feedback loops, and I asked about some technical portion of it,
    he replied he didn't know about that, but his physics co-author did. This suggested
    to me the mechanism itself was not important, but rather, it generated the right
    big-picture pattern. How naive. If I want to generate a model of the stock market,
    I could rationalize a model of geometric brownian motion, with some Poisson jump
    process, perhaps some auto-regressive volatility, and say that looks like the
    S&P500, but that's hardly a model, just a description. It doesn't predict anymore
    than the rand() function predicts lottery numbers (they look like lottery numbers--very
    random!).

    Prior to the 1990 recession, it was generating a lot of buzz, because it used
    a Kalman filter, just like real rocket scientists, and seemed obviously better
    than the simple sum of ten correlates with business cycles. Yet the model failed
    to predict the 1990-1991 recession, and an updated version of the model then failed
    to predict the 2001 recession. Each time, however, Stock and Watson were very
    honest and clear about the degree it failed and why (see

    forecasters. Further, reading this research, I feel I learned something, which
    I never have done from the econophysicists (other than they don't realize that
    perfect competition, or Gaussian distributions are not necessary assumptions to
    most economic theories, see
