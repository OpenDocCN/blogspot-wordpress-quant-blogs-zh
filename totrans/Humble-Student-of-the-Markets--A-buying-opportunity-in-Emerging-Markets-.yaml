    equity market. Technically speaking, the accompanying chart of the iShare MSCI
    Emerging Markets ETF (EEM) relative to the S&P 500 shows they are currently undergoing
    a high level consolidation but the relative uptrend remains intact.

    market-like stocks than the consensus. These are all encouraging signs for emerging
    market equities. There is no doubt that these stocks tend to more volatile than
    US equities and are at risk of underperforming should the US go into a deeper
    or more prolonged slowdown than expected. However, I would give the emerging markets
    the benefit of the doubt but enter the trade with a fairly tight stop. Should
    the relative chart of EEM vs. SPX break its relative support line, that would
    be the signal to get out.
