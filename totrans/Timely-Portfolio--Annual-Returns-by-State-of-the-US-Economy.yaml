- en: Sometimes it is fun to just look at annual returns, especially as the financial
    world has shifted its focus to microseconds in a world of inconceivable macro
    imbalances.  [St. Louis Fed (USREC)](http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2) offers
    a binary state of the economy with 1=recession and 0=expansion, but we all must
    remember that the assignment of the beginning and end dates of recessions occurs
    with a 1 to 2 year lag, so we cannot use them for real-time trading even at a
    monthly level.  However, we might be able to examine equity returns on a yearly
    level given the state of the economy in the previous year.  With a little ggplot2,
    I think a lot of folks might be surprised at a simple look at annual Dow Jones
    Industrial returns since 1921\. In and around recessions, the market is either
    really right or really wrong.  Then in the last chart, my thought is that stocks
    will not be cheap again until we see a recession that lasts greater than 1 year.

    [The Strategic and Tactical Value of Commodity Futures in the March/April 2006
    Financial Analysts Journal](http://www.cfapubs.org/doi/abs/10.2469/faj.v62.n2.4084)
    that shows the following graph, which I have unfortunately not been able to replicate.
