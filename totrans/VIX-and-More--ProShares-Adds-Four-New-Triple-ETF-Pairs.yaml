    the first batch of [triple ETFs](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/triple%20ETFs)
    back in November 2008, I may have been the first person to openly champion them,
    even going way out on a limb with [Prediction: Direxion Triple ETFs Will Revolutionize

    investors and eventually prompted regulators to step in, with FINRA [increasing
    margin requirements for triple ETFs](http://www.finra.org/web/groups/industry/@ip/@reg/@notice/documents/notices/p119906.pdf)
    on December 1, 2009.

    investor discontent, with trading volumes recently having picked up again after
    [signs of a plateau](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2010/01/triple-etf-options-landscape-one-month.html).

    another vote of confidence today, as ProShares [launched eight new triple ETFs](http://www.proshares.com/resources/news/proshares_launches_daily_3x_etfs.html).
    ProShares, which launched their first two triple ETFs ([UPRO](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/UPRO)
    and [SPXU](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SPXU)) in June of last
    year, is now back with a broader line of index offerings. New today are two pairs
    which cover new ground and two that closely overlap with existing Direxion triple
    ETFs. The pair that interests me the most are those which track the NASDAQ-100
    index ([NDX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/NDX)): [TQQQ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TQQQ)
    is the new +3x ETF for the NDX; [SQQQ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SQQQ)
    is the new -3x ETF. Also breaking new ground are a pair linked to the Dow Jones
    Industrial Average: [UDOW](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/UDOW) is
    the +3x ETF; and [SDOW](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SDOW) is the
    -3x variant.'

    For the S&P MidCap 400 index, ProShares is offering [UMDD](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/UMDD)
    (+3x) and [SMDD](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SMDD) (-3x). The
    risk here is that these two offerings may be too similar to the Direxion [MWJ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/MWJ)
    and [MWN](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/MWN), which are based on
    the Russell Midcap index. An even larger overlap problem is likely with the new
    ProShares Russell 2000 index ETFs, which include [URTY](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/URTY)
    (+3x) and [SRTY](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SRTY) (-3x). Here
    there is very little to distinguish these ETFs from the popular Direxion [TNA](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TNA)
    and [TZA](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TZA) ETFs.

- en: In a market where a first mover advantage is often decisive, ProShares faces
    an uphill battle, but already UPRO and SPXU have been widely accepted and there
    is no reason to believe TQQQ/SQQQ and UDOW/SDOQ will not enjoy similar success.
    The prognosis for the new mid-cap and small cap ETFs, however, is not as favorable.
