    a number and make it an important support and resistance level. Sometimes these
    lines in the sand are ephemeral and sometimes they persist for extended periods.

    in the SPX trading range I talked about in [Strangle Pong](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/10/strangle-pong.html)
    and two subsequent posts (see links below.)

    once again. In the chart below, 1070 acts as critical support for awhile on February
    4^(th), then as resistance on the 8^(th). Yesterday and today, 1070 was a pivot
    point of sorts, acting as both support and resistance. With 1070 just above today’s
    close and the futures currently pointing to a bullish start to tomorrow’s session,
    I will be watching closely to see how the SPX acts while crossing above or below
    the 1070 level.
