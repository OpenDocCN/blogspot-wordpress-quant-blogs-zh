- en: '**Mid-week market update**: The [“three white soldiers” candlestick pattern](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/three_white_soldiers.asp)
    is made up of three long white candles, and typically occurs after a falling price
    trend. It is indicative of strong price momentum after a price reversal. This
    pattern is evident in the weekly S&P 500 chart shown below.  Usually, the market
    consolidates sideways after the “three white soldiers”, but the market has continued
    to advance on the back of the strength of the recent breadth thrust signals. As
    well, the index faces initial resistance at about 4600, which should be overwhelmed
    in light of a combination of strong price momentum and the lack of volume resistance
    (see side bars).'
