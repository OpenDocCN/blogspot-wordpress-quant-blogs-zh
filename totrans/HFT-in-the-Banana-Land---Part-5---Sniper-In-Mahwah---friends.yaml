    here is episode 5\. A lot of things has happened around the banana land since
    January 2016\. Two months after [episode 3](https://sniperinmahwah.wordpress.com/2016/02/12/hft-in-the-banana-land-part-iii/) was
    posted, a new event occured in Richborough as another HFT-related company, New
    Line Networks (or NLN, a telco joint venture between HFT firms Jump Trading and
    KCG ex-Getco) filed an application to build another giant (305-meter) mast close
    to the Vigilant one. NLN filed the application on May 4 2016, four months after
    Vigilant arrived in the banana and. A lot has been said in newspaper about the
    frontral competition between two HFT-related firms in this quiet corner of the
    United Kingdom, so let’s do it will be as brief as possible. The two applications
    will be examined today at 6pm by the Dover District Council during the Planning Committee
    meeting, in Dover, where I just arrived.

- en: Vigilant was the first firm to apply for a 325-meter mast in the so-called “banana
    land” of Richborough. The firm from Montreal decided to erect this tower there
    because the banana land is close to the straight line joining Slough and Richborouch
    (cf. the previous episodes). The Vigilant mast would be erected very close to
    the cooling towers of old the Richborough Power station (the towers were demolished
    in 2012 but in the picture below you can see them, with the Richborough Roman
    fort on the foreground). It seems Vigilant choose this area because it’s still
    industrial, meaning the firm tried to mitigate the impact of the mast on the landscape
    (old big towers replaced by one very thin tower – quite cleaver).

    that would be erected in King Ends Farm (KEF), which is located at 1 kilometer
    from the old power station. That means two HFT firms want to erect two quasi-identical
    towers in the exact same area (one giant mast seemed a crazy project, two giant
    masts is obviously too much).

    to defend their projects (and to attack the competitor) – a one-year battle, or
    so. The most interesting is the way the local residents/politicians/authorities/institutions
    have been thinking about the giant towers, and as expected most of the residents
    don’t want them in their backyards. There are a lot of interesting (sometimes
    fun) comments, such as: “*Such a mast would be an eyesore*”, “*HFTs are parasite,
    leading to flash crashes*”, and “*there is also concern over the visual impact
    of such a large structure given the proximity of Richborough Roman Fort as well
    as possible future adverse implications if Manston was to resume as an airport*” and
    so on. At the end, the Vigilant application received 124 public comments (Objections:
    101; Supporting: 21), and NLN 202 comments (Objections: 182; Supporting: 14).
    (At some point I send an ironic comment about the NLN mast, when it showed up
    in March 2016, I just wrote “*I love you!*” and you know what? NLN decided that
    it was a “supporting comment”! Very funny.)'

    The local parishes were asked to adopt a position too, some objected, other supported
    (but the ones who support also say: “*However, the Dover District Council would
    urge any businesses planning to build telecommunication masts to work together,
    thus reducing the total number of masts*”. Note that if this is the Dover District
    Council (DDC) councillors who will decide tonight about the mast(s), and they
    do not have to follow the opinions of the parish councils. Also, a lot of “institutions”
    (Historic England, Natural England, etc.) wrote comments too, saying that, for
    instance, the construction of the mast would affect a local plant named *Lotus
    corniculatus*. There are also some issues about the Richborough Roman Fort (“*The
    Environmental Statement identifies a potential significant effect on tourists
    and visitors to Richborough Roman Fort*”), other issues about the possible reopening
    of the Manston airport (the masts would hinder the pilots), other issues about
    the new National Grid project named Nemo (cf. previous episodes), etc., etc. In
    short, both the firms had to file a lot of documents to comply with the demands
    – for instance, on June 9, 2016, Vigilant filed dozens of new documents, answering
    to the first comments/questions, which was a considerable work, and they did it
    well – kudos.

    community: broadcasting equipments for Academy FM; broadband connection to the
    Phoenix Centre; educational support for at the Sandwich Technology School; a £100,000
    financial support to enhance the visitor experiences at the Roman Fort (in fact,
    the Roman Fort officials does not want any mast around the fort, but if the DDC
    allows one mast, they will take the money). Vigilant states than a minimum of
    £2 million would be “transferred” to the local community “for the life time of
    the project”, *i.e.* 20 years. That means £8333,33 a month, and that’s not that
    much if you think about it – of course, I assume the firms will also have to pay
    rents to the owners of spots where they seek to erect the masts – I found no data
    about that – but compare £8333,33 a month for a giant mast with the €20,000 (Vigilant)
    and the €40,000 (NLN) will pay per month in Oostduinerke, Belgium, to put dishes
    on an existing building. (If you want to know more about the economic benefits

    Vigilant sent a document to the DDC where they criticize the NLN mast, saying
    that NLN forget to propose aviation warning lights on their mast (in case the
    Manston airport reopens), that the location choose by NLN is not good for the
    migratory birds, that the NLN mast would be close to the Richborough Roman Fort,
    and bla bla bla. That’s the game: as we can expect that two quasi-identical masts
    would not be allowed in the exact same area, the better project is expected to win,

    to decide if, as a competitor said, “*looking at a 320m mast for 20 years is worth
    helping a trading firm gain 5 microseconds*”. Tough question. Let’s over simplify
    and say that the total cost of a mast in the banana land would be £5-6 millions
    (construction, community outreach and goodies, dishes, legal stuff, etc.); that
    would mean saving *one millionth of a second* costs ± £1 million. That’s a lot
    of money for such a short period of time… or not – it depends on the money you

    Richborough is refused by the DDC councillors tonight. It’s certainly more difficult
    (technically speaking) to cross the Channel with two small towers (that’s the
    reason Vigilant wanted a 5m extension to the tower) compared to the 322-meter
    mast they hope in Richborough, but at least they can be sure that the residents won’t
    complain, and nobody will ask for *Lotus corniculatus’ *opinion there. Tilmanstone
    is not as close to the straight line as Richborough is, but compared to the Dunkerque/Doudekerque-Swingate
    path Vigilant built to cross the Channel, it’s a little bit better (are they saving
    1 microsecond? or half a microsecond?). Looks like a consolation prize if the
    mast in Richborough is refused.

    dishes (after all, most of the competitors cross the Channel with smaller towers, except
    for NLN who has the 243-meter tower in Houtem); that’s said, NLN also says they
    are ready to extend their mast so that it would be 325-meter too. However, the
    argument about McKay Brothers is a bit facetious : 1/ if the Ofcom licence asked
    by McKay is indeed for a path from the NLN mast in Kind Ends Farm to Oostduinkerke,
    the licence can easily be changed to accomodate the Vigilant mast, and 2/ saying
    that both McKay and Latent want to put their dishes at 250 meters is a bit excessive
    because when operators ask for an Ofcom licence, the exact location of the dishes
    on a mast are most of the time approximative until the dishes are physically installed.'

    NLN submitted to the DDC is a 40-page (!) document defending their mast in Kings
    End Farm and the way they would create a “Community Interest Company” (CIC), a is
    a limited company which is created for community benefit.

- en: I came from Brussels to Dover first by car (so I visited for the last time the
    HFT towers in Flanders, including the Houtem tower where all this story started),
    then I took a ferry from Calais to Dover and I arrived at the Ramada hotel which
    is near the DDC offices where the meeting will start in 45 minutes. This is the
    only hotel in the surrounding area, so I guess other people involved in the HFT
    world are there too. Perhaps I’m surrounded by an army of HFTs, who knows? Now
    it’s time to walk to the DDC offices. I’ll try to live-tweet the meeting if I
    can.
