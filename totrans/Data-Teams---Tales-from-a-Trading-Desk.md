## Data Teams

Another interesting read over at [Monzo](https://monzo.com/blog/2016/11/30/laying-the-foundation-for-a-data-team/) – Laying the Foundation for a Data Team.  Hard not to agree with the “Three core principles” listed: Autonomy, Cutting-edge managed analytics infrastructure and Automation.   I’m always impressed with the ideals people come up with when given autonomy over data and thought 🙂  Automation and infrastructure (via code) are I think key to any software project, not just data 🙂

[Kafka](https://monzo.com/blog/2016/09/19/building-a-modern-bank-backend/) – enough said 🙂  Isn’t is in all data solutions ?  “[ETL Is Dead](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/etl-streams), Long Live Streams” discusses Kafka nicely 🙂
