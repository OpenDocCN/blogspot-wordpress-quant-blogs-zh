- en: The rocket-fueled rally continues this morning, with today’s rally marked by
    very strong breadth and advancing volume ahead of declining volume by more than
    10-1 as I write this.

    retreating and we will have some semblance of a top. With SPX 1000 just around
    the corner, tomorrow the last trading day of the month and a number of overbought
    signals being pushed to extremes, today or tomorrow looks like a good place for
    any bears left alive to make their stand.

- en: The chart below shows that since the March lows, five of the major indices have
    rallied from 43% (Dow Jones Industrial Average) to 64% (Russell 2000 small cap
    index).

- en: In addition to being a nice round number and source of psychological support
    and resistance, SPX 1000 also marks exactly a 50% rally from the March bottom.
    If the bears cannot keep the SPX under 1010, then there is very little in the
    way of resistance on the way up to 1050.
