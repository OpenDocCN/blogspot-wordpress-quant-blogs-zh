- en: While it was not a big bounce, the fact that Portfolio A1 bounced 1% more than
    the benchmark S&P 500 index did last week has to be considered a good sign.  After
    49 weeks, the portfolio’s 6.4% gain still compares quite favorably to the 8.6%
    loss in the SPX over the same period.

    led the way with an 8.6% gain for the week, after taking the fertilizer baton
    from previous portfolio anchor, [The Mosaic Company (MOS)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=mos).

- en: The 2008 year to date numbers (through Friday) show that Portfolio A1 has fallen
    faster than the SPX – -12.8% vs. -8.7% – with the superior cumulative performance
    numbers for the portfolio largely a reflection of a superb fourth quarter in 2007.  Some
    may see this as a possible anomaly, but this portfolio is set up to ‘fish for
    whales,’ a theme I will expound upon in the future.
