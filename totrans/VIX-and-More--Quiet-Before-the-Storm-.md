# VIX and More: Quiet Before the Storm?

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/10/quiet-before-storm.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/10/quiet-before-storm.html#0001-01-01)

Though the most recent installment was published last Friday, I would be remiss in not highlighting the work done by Fred Ruffy at [Optionetics.com](http://www.optionetics.com/images/optionetics.gif). Fred authors a weekly [Sentiment Journal](http://www.optionetics.com/search.asp?keyword=sentiment+journal) that covers many of the issues I touch on here, with a mixture of charts, tables and text in an effort to summarize the week that was and provide some insights into the coming week.

Ruffy's most recent entry bears the title [Quiet Before the Storm?](http://www.optionetics.com/market/articles/article.asp?id=18172) He looks at much of the same data that interests me and we reach many of the same conclusions, mostly cautionary, about the current state of the markets. For the record, even with today's continued market strength, I find myself net short the markets (and long volatility) for the first time in 2007.

Finally, for those who may be interested, Fred also fields questions at Optionetics on their [Ask Fred Ruffy](http://www.optionetics.com/bbs/forum.asp?forum_id=39&forum_title=Ask+Fred+Ruffy) discussion board.
