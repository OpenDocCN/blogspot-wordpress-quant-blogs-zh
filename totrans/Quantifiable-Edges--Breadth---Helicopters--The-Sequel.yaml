    In my post I indicated that this didn’t sway me from treating them the same as
    I had previously.

  zh: 所以六七月间的抛售抹去了两个拥有“完美”记录的广度指标。在我的帖子中我表示，这并没有让我改变之前对待它们的方式。
- en: I should mention that I am neither surprised nor concerned that they both “failed”
    at the same time. For the most part they both measure the same thing – breadth.
    One looks at broad market advance/decline breadth while the other looks at how
    broad extreme selling is in a select list of securities. Still, they’re both looking
    at breadth. There is no question that it became extremely negative in June. And
    rather than being accompanied by the sharp bounce that has been customary for
    the last 25 years, the market continued to slide.

  zh: 我应该提到，我对它们同时“失败”并不感到惊讶，也不担心。大部分时候它们都衡量的是同样的事物——广度。一个观察的是广泛市场 advance/decline
    广度，而另一个观察的是在精选证券列表中广度极端卖出情况。尽管如此，它们都在观察广度。毫无疑问，六月份广度变得极其负面。而这一次，并没有像过去25年习惯的剧烈反弹，市场继续下滑。
- en: One notable about both of the indicators discussed in yesterday’s post is that
    their history was somewhat limited. The McClellan data I used only went back to
    1986 and the CBI data back to 1995\. Under most circumstances, if I get enough
    instances that the results appear notable, I’m more than comfortable only going
    back this far.

  zh: 关于昨天帖子中讨论的两个指标的一个显著特点是，它们的历史是相当有限的。我使用的麦克里兰数据只追溯到1986年，CBI数据追溯到1995年。在大多数情况下，如果我找到足够多的实例，结果看起来值得注意，我完全满意只追溯到这么远。

- en: '*“I go back to the Crash of ’87 for a few reasons. First, it was the last time
    that strong negative breadth readings, such as the % below 40ma and the 10-day
    Advance/Decline EMA led to further selling, and in a big way. Second, it led to
    changes in the way the market is governed and monitored. Some changes, such as
    the implementation of* [*trading curbs*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trading_curb)*,
    are well documented. Others, such as the* [*President’s Working Group*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_Group_on_Financial_Markets)*,
    are clouded in mystery. Whatever the reason, breadth extremes as we’ve seen recently
    have consistently marked buying opportunities over the last 20+ years.”*'

- en: My inclination is that we are not going to revert to a 70’s – type market where
    selling just begets more selling. For the market to change the way it has behaved
    for the last 20+ years would take a substantial change in dynamics. Has such a
    change occurred? Difficult to know, but I don’t think so. No uptick rule? Double-short
    ETF’s? The ability of retail traders to easily trade baskets of commodities via
    ETF’s? These are all relatively recent developments and they have changed market
    dynamics in some way. Enough to cause fairly reliable overbought/oversold breadth
    indicators to become obsolete? I don’t believe so and like I said yesterday, I’m
    currently just looking at it as a losing episode.

  zh: 我的看法是我们不会回归到70年代类型的市场，在那个市场中，卖出只会导致更多的卖出。市场要改变过去20年+的行为方式，需要巨大的动态变化。这样的变化发生了吗？很难说，但我不这么认为。没有上涨规则？双倍空头ETF？零售交易者通过ETF轻松交易大宗商品的能力？这些都是相对较新的发展，它们以某种方式改变了市场动态。足以使广度指标过时吗？我不这么认为，而且我昨天说过，我现在只是把它看作是一个失败的案例。
- en: So why did it happen? I don’t know. One observation I would make is that since
    the Crash of ’87, the government seems to have taken a greater interest in the
    equity markets. For instance over the past few years there have been several times
    when the market appears on the precipice of something awful and the Fed arrives
    with an announcement that seems to spark a rally. This occurred in March. It occurred
    in January. It occurred last August. It occurred March of 2007\. It occurred in
    June 2006\. Those are a few I can recall off the top of my head. Each time the
    market turned seemingly because of a rate cut, or a bail out, or an expansion
    of the use of the discount window, or something.

  zh: 那么这是为什么发生的呢？我不知道。我会观察到的一个现象是，自1987年股市崩盘以来，政府似乎对股市更加感兴趣。例如，过去几年市场多次处于悬崖边缘，美联储带着似乎引发反弹的声明出现。这发生在三月份。在一月份。去年八月份。2007年3月份。2006年6月份。这些是我能立刻想起的几次。每次市场似乎都是因为利率削减、救助或贴现窗口的扩展而扭转。
- en: During the recent selloff the Fed has been caught between a rock and a hard
    place. Whereas under other circumstances they MAY have stepped in sooner with
    some announcement that could help spark at least a short-covering rally, this
    time the anouncement didn’t come. The double-edged sword of inflation and recession
    was threatening and there wasn’t much they were willing to do. Also, the nature
    of the selloff was not crash-like. There was little panic. The mood was dour as
    seen by investment and consumer sentiment surveys, but not outright panic as could
    be evidenced by the VIX. While not immediately hailed, a temporary enforcement
    of short selling rules in certain financial stocks MAY have helped the recent
    bounce.

  zh: 在最近的抛售期间，美联储陷入了进退两难的境地。在其他情况下，他们可能更早地发表某些声明来帮助引发至少是一次短期回补反弹，但这次声明没有到来。通胀和衰退的双刃剑威胁着，他们愿意采取的行动并不多。此外，这次抛售的性质并不是类似于崩盘。没有多少恐慌。从投资和消费者情绪调查来看，情绪是悲观的，但VIX显示并没有出现恐慌。虽然不是立即得到认可，但在某些金融股票中暂时执行卖空规则可能有助于最近的弹升。
- en: Perhaps stagflation will become a real problem. Perhaps the Fed will continually
    find itself handcuffed or the government will decide it will no longer considers
    the equity markets an important consideration in constructing policy. Perhaps
    the introduction of double-short ETF’s, commodity and currency ETF’s, no uptick
    rule and other things are changing the dynamics of the market in such a way that
    certain indicators, such as some of the breadth measures I use, will no longer
    be effective. I don’t believe that to be true, though and at this point I’m betting
    against all of that. I will continue to run studies and construct systems in the
    same manner I did before the latest meltdown.

  zh: 也许滞胀将成为一个真正的问题。也许美联储会不断发现自己受限，或者政府决定不再将股市作为制定政策的重要考虑因素。也许双倍做空ETF、商品和货币ETF、取消上涨规则和其他因素正在以某种方式改变市场的动态，以至于某些指标，如我所使用的广度测量工具，将不再有效。虽然我不认为这是真的，但在此时我却在对这些因素下注。我会继续进行研究，并以与最新崩盘之前相同的方式构建系统。
