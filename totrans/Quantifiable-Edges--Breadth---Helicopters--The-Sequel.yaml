    points. I don’t care to get into a lengthy debate and couldn’t possibly address
    all the issues that were raised, but I thought I would offer a few comments for
    further clarification on my thinking. I’ll also touch on a few of the issues discussed
    in the comments section. Anyone who hasn’t read yesterday’s post or some of the
    comments people made following may want to check that out before continuing.

    In my post I indicated that this didn’t sway me from treating them the same as
    I had previously.

- en: I should mention that I am neither surprised nor concerned that they both “failed”
    at the same time. For the most part they both measure the same thing – breadth.
    One looks at broad market advance/decline breadth while the other looks at how
    broad extreme selling is in a select list of securities. Still, they’re both looking
    at breadth. There is no question that it became extremely negative in June. And
    rather than being accompanied by the sharp bounce that has been customary for
    the last 25 years, the market continued to slide.

- en: One notable about both of the indicators discussed in yesterday’s post is that
    their history was somewhat limited. The McClellan data I used only went back to
    1986 and the CBI data back to 1995\. Under most circumstances, if I get enough
    instances that the results appear notable, I’m more than comfortable only going
    back this far.

    understand is that prior to that the market did behave differently in many ways.

    that strong negative breadth readings, such as the % below 40ma and the 10-day
    Advance/Decline EMA led to further selling, and in a big way. Second, it led to
    changes in the way the market is governed and monitored. Some changes, such as
    the implementation of* [*trading curbs*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trading_curb)*,
    are well documented. Others, such as the* [*President’s Working Group*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_Group_on_Financial_Markets)*,
    are clouded in mystery. Whatever the reason, breadth extremes as we’ve seen recently
    have consistently marked buying opportunities over the last 20+ years.”*'

    such as we were hitting in late June have normally provided traders an edge over
    the last 20 years. Prior to that, expectations were negative to flat.

    getting was the persistence of the downtrend. Whereas in the past 20 years oversold
    was met with buying and violent short-covering rallies, it just wasn’t happening
    in June and early July. I first discussed this in my

    environment or was the selloff just an anomaly? Will breadth indicators remain
    useful?

- en: My inclination is that we are not going to revert to a 70’s – type market where
    selling just begets more selling. For the market to change the way it has behaved
    for the last 20+ years would take a substantial change in dynamics. Has such a
    change occurred? Difficult to know, but I don’t think so. No uptick rule? Double-short
    ETF’s? The ability of retail traders to easily trade baskets of commodities via
    ETF’s? These are all relatively recent developments and they have changed market
    dynamics in some way. Enough to cause fairly reliable overbought/oversold breadth
    indicators to become obsolete? I don’t believe so and like I said yesterday, I’m
    currently just looking at it as a losing episode.

- en: So why did it happen? I don’t know. One observation I would make is that since
    the Crash of ’87, the government seems to have taken a greater interest in the
    equity markets. For instance over the past few years there have been several times
    when the market appears on the precipice of something awful and the Fed arrives
    with an announcement that seems to spark a rally. This occurred in March. It occurred
    in January. It occurred last August. It occurred March of 2007\. It occurred in
    June 2006\. Those are a few I can recall off the top of my head. Each time the
    market turned seemingly because of a rate cut, or a bail out, or an expansion
    of the use of the discount window, or something.

- en: During the recent selloff the Fed has been caught between a rock and a hard
    place. Whereas under other circumstances they MAY have stepped in sooner with
    some announcement that could help spark at least a short-covering rally, this
    time the anouncement didn’t come. The double-edged sword of inflation and recession
    was threatening and there wasn’t much they were willing to do. Also, the nature
    of the selloff was not crash-like. There was little panic. The mood was dour as
    seen by investment and consumer sentiment surveys, but not outright panic as could
    be evidenced by the VIX. While not immediately hailed, a temporary enforcement
    of short selling rules in certain financial stocks MAY have helped the recent
    bounce.

    find itself handcuffed or the government will decide it will no longer considers
    the equity markets an important consideration in constructing policy. Perhaps
    the introduction of double-short ETF’s, commodity and currency ETF’s, no uptick
    rule and other things are changing the dynamics of the market in such a way that
    certain indicators, such as some of the breadth measures I use, will no longer
    be effective. I don’t believe that to be true, though and at this point I’m betting
    against all of that. I will continue to run studies and construct systems in the
    same manner I did before the latest meltdown.
