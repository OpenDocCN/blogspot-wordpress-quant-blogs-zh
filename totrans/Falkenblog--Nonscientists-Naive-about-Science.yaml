- en: In all these cases, science mainly is about explanation, not prediction, and
    practitioners exhibit much more precision and confidence than is objectively warranted.
    Even in cases where there is prediction, like Global Warming, this is not a falsifiable
    prediction. There are not unambiguous Global Warming forecasts with standard errors,
    such that in one's lifetime any Global Warming advocate could be proven wrong.
    If the world shows no trend in temperatures, it will simply be seen as temporary.

  zh: 在所有这些案例中，科学主要是关于解释，而不是预测，实践者表现出比客观上理所当然更多的精确和自信。即使在有预测的情况下，比如全球变暖，这并不是一个可验证的预测。没有明确的全球变暖预测及标准误差，以至于在一个人的一生中任何一名全球变暖的支持者都可能被证明是错误的。如果世界的温度没有趋势，那将被简单地视为暂时的。在主要科学争论中没有明确的测试。
- en: So, when some journalists talks about how horrible it is that politicians, or
    voters, do not understand science, which their rigorous falsification of hypotheses,
    I say, gimme a break. The biggest scientific debates are not about testing a definitive
    hypothesis, they are more often about coming up with more evidence for a meta-view
    about some bigger truth, hardly much different than our quaint medieval ancestors.
    The big ideas are fun to think about, and I have opinions on them, but I'm not
    naive enough to think these debates are subject to the ideals of THE scientific
    method, where only objective, rational empiricism is involved. Tests that don't
    go our way are dismissed, tests that favor our predisposition are emphasized.

  zh: 所以，当一些记者谈论政治家或选民不懂得科学、对假设的严格反证时，我只能说，算了吧。最大的科学争论不是关于检验一个明确假设，而更多是为了为某个更大的真相提供更多证据，这与我们古老的中世纪祖先的想法几乎没有什么不同。大的观点是有趣的，我对此也有自己的看法，但我并不天真到认为这些辩论受到了唯一正确的科学方法的理想主义影响，那里只是涉及到客观、理性的经验论。结果不符合我们的预期的测试会被忽略，支持我们偏见的测试则会被强调。
- en: If you don't think that is true, think about how many Keynesian economists became
    supply-siders over their career or supply-siders who became Keynesians. Think
    about the market efficiency debate, where irrationalists (eg, Thaler, Shleifer,
    Stiglitz) are against those who see the markets as rational (eg, Fama, Cochrane,
    and French). I would estimate less than 5% of economists change sides over their
    working lives. Yet, they are all scientists, use logic, examine data, publish
    in peer-reviewed journals, understand statistics, and generally think they have
    good faith trying to understand the world as it is. The data seem rather unconvincing
    to diametric views on the big ideas within any field.

    5% 的经济学家在他们的职业生涯中改变立场。然而，他们都是科学家，使用逻辑，研究数据，发表同行评审的期刊，了解统计学，通常认为自己是在努力诚实地理解世界。在任何领域内，数据似乎都对于关于大的观点有截然相反的观点缺乏说服力。

    argue your case, but in real-time any big debate necessarily will have ambiguous
    facts for the simple reason that if the data were definitive there would not be
    a debate. Further, important matters necessarily have a debate, because there
    if there's no debate one takes it for granted, as opposed to seeing it as something
    noble to fight for. In this cynical view of the world, it is best to have common
    sense, which Einstein said 'is nothing more than a deposit of prejudices laid

  zh: 有事实支持会更有利，因为这样在辩论时会更容易证明自己的立场。但是在现实中，任何重大辩论必然会有模棱两可的事实，因为如果数据能够明确无误，就不会有辩论了。此外，重大问题必然会引起辩论，因为如果没有辩论，人们会觉得理所当然，而不会把它视为值得为之奋斗的高尚事业。在这种对世界的愤世嫉俗的看法下，最好还是具备常识，爱因斯坦说的“不过是十八岁之前形成的偏见的堆砌”。
