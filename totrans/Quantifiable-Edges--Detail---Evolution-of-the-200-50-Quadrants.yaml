    S&P when it was in a certain quadrant. I’ve also changed the test to buy $100k
    worth of the cash index rather than 1 share. This effectively gives us percentage
    returns. It also changes the end results slightly so you’ll need to be aware of
    the differences.

    drawdowns and has had some nice upside participation. I find it interesting that
    it peaked in 2000, though. The most recent bull market of 2003-2007 failed to
    see much headway at all when the market was above these two lines. I would classify
    it as a weak bull. It was extremely rotational and saw little in the way of buying
    enthusiasm when the market began hitting new highs. While I observed these characteristics
    at the time, this is the first time I’ve viewed it in this manner.

    of the 80’s began. During the 60’s stocks spun their wheels in this area and during
    the 70’s they lost money. The total gains are not as large here as in Quadrant
    1 when looking at percentage gains. Yesterday they were larger when looking at
    point gains. That’s due to the fact that this quadrant did its losing early on
    when the points were low and its winning more recently when the points were high.
    Thus the point gains were a bit exaggerated.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The exaggeration is not a bad thing. In fact, using points rather than %’s basically
    front weights more recent developments. Think of it as an Exponential Moving Average
    vs. a Simple Moving Average. The gains since 1980 have been much greater per day
    in here than in Quadrant 1\. The total percent gained is almost the same over
    that time and the market has spent over 3 times the amount of time in quadrant
    1 vs. quadrant 2\. (55% vs. 16% since 1980) Again, Quadrant 2 outperforms Quadrant
    1 although its not as obvious just from the graph. Short-term pullbacks in long-term
    uptrends have made for good buying opportunities.

    from a bear and beginning a new bull some gains are to be found here. I also broke
    this down by where the quadrant was entered – did it come from 1 or 4? Not surprisingly
    almost all gains were realized when this quadrant was entered from Quadrant 4
    and moving up.
  prefs: []

    market has spent 23% of its time.

    Other than that it was not a place you wanted to bet on the long side. When the
    market enters this quadrant from above it’s probably best to adjust your strategy
    and trade in bear market mode.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A big take-away is that the market evolves over time. Sometimes this is missed
    when looking only at tables. Sometimes equity curves are able to capture this
    well. By understanding how the market has reacted in the past, especially the
    more recent past, we can better adapt our trading to take advantage of its movements.
