    to hold its gains and finished the last few days beneath a key technical resistance

    staged a mild rally on the news and then sold off. The Dow rallied to kiss the
    13K level and wound up roughly flat on the day. Does this sound like a market
    where the bulls are in control or does it sound like they're exhausted?

    something like this (Note: Wild ass guessing to follow). Markets kiss 13,000,
    pullback and consolidate. But they are not overbought sufficiently for anything
    more serious than a modest retracement, and so they continue higher for several
    months, until the % of stocks over 200 day MA is near 90% (they are at 75% today).
    That takes us somewhere between March and June. The next sell off begins, lopping
    25% or so off of the SPX. The Federal Reserve waits until after the November election
    to introduce QE3, and the cycle starts anew.'

    grind upward. After that, we'll have to watch how events unfold.
