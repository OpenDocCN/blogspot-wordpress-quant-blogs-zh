    Several assume that the market, or the government, should merely add equity. This
    is often conflated with 'nationalization', but really we are not contemplating
    the US government actually buying and running banks prospectively. They are really
    considering various ways of become silent partners.

    regulators, and debt holders, are unhappy with this state of affairs. In this
    case, the optimal thing to do is merely let the market recapitalize. Equity owners
    are unwilling to lose the franchise value of the bank, say from brand name and
    existing customer relationships. So, they are willing to appease regulators and
    debtholders by accept dilution to maintain the little value they have. One might
    facilitate this via the Meltzer plan, of having the government match fund equity
    investors. The bottom line is that equity owners, that is, those who direct management,
    will agree to this remedy.

    1.1 units) via write-downs so that the bank is insolvent, its debts are worth
    more than the assets. In this case, the government may wish to make the debt holders
    whole to retain the franchise value of the bank. Equity owners are wiped out,
    however. That is, all they need do here, is put in 0.1 units, and then equity
    owners are willing to add the other unit. This cost of 0.1 units, is less than
    if they acquired the bank, and sold off the pieces. There is a significant going
    concern value that is preserved if the failed bank is sold to another bank, the
    main way a bank is recapitalized, compared to if the bank is merely liquidated
    by the government. These losses are twofold. First, there is the value loss from
    exiting customer relations that are now reassigned, and brand value of the bank
    (really, capitalized future customer relationships. Secondly, the government is
    probably a less efficient in liquidating assets than the private sector because
    they do not have an incentive to merely maximize the return on the bank assets.
    These costs are large and significant, and was documented in examining the S&L
    crisis in the late 1980''s (see'

    be greater than any gain from maintaining the franchise value, or avoiding the
    extra costs of relative government inefficiency. If the government burns, say,
    1 unit of franchise value, and also 1 unit via their incompetence, this is 2 units,
    still better to wipe out the bank and sell it off as opposed to paying debt owners
    5 units to save the 2\. The optimal action if for the bank to be simply acquired

    latter scenario resulted in several billions of US liability in the S&L crisis,
    as several banks found that changing the rules on bank goodwill merely destroyed
    an accounting contrivance, in the process creating a bank that violated the regulatory
    requirements and destroyed the bank's franchise value because by law it had to
    be taken over, even though equity and debt owners were willing to operate the
    bank. Destroying a bank's franchise value in such a manner destroys real value,
    and the courts agreed with this. It is not the legal liability I am concerned
    with, rather, the suboptimality of destroying bank value, from the relative inefficiency
    of government bureaucrats or the franchise value loss.

- en: A zombie bank is like scenario 3 where the bank is not shut down by the government.
    The government keeps it alive, via forcing debtholders to renegotiate their terms,
    but the bank is insolvent no new equity owners are forthcoming. The bank owners,
    afraid of losing the option value of their ownership, merely wait for inflation
    to make the nominal value of assets rise above the value of the debt, but if inflation
    remains low, this may take a long time. Interestingly, in these situations, the
    small amount of equity does not generate the inordinate risk taking from taking
    advantage of the 'heads I win, tails the government loses' approach to the bank,
    but rather, a timid owner waiting for nominal prices to make the bank solvent.

  zh: 僵尸银行就像场景3一样，政府没有关闭银行。政府通过强迫债权人重新协商条款来维持银行的生存，但由于没有新的股权所有者，银行资不抵债。银行拥有者害怕失去所有权的期权价值，只是等待通货膨胀使资产的名义价值上升超过债务价值，但如果通货膨胀保持低位，这可能需要很长时间。有趣的是，在这种情况下，少量股本并没有因为利用“正面我赢，反面政府输”对银行采取不适当风险而产生过多风险，而是因为害怕等待名义价格使银行偿债。
- en: The key is that for solvent banks one might think match funding equity infusions
    is worthwhile, and indeed it seems reasonable to assume that such an investment
    will be ok, because investors are also investing new capital on equal terms. But
    for insolvent banks, the only way to get the capital ratios back to solvency involves
    government injections, not mere match funding. No equity owner will take scenario
    3 back to solvency, because investing 5 units to bring it back to normal, would
    be a transfer of 4 units to the debt owners, meaning, new investors would add
    5 units to get 1 unit of bank ownership, a poor investment relative to buying
    stock in a solvent bank, of which there are many.
