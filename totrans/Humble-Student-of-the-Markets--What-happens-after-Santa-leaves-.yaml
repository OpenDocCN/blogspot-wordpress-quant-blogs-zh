    action is suggestive of economic weakness. Such signals have the potential to
    spook the global growth outlook once the seasonal rally peters out. In fact, it
    is only the combination of the short-term seasonal pattern and the recent oversold
    readings that have kept the Trend Model from moving to a more cautious reading.

    candidate, former European commissioner Stavros Dimas. Another 135 voted “present”
    while five were absent. The result was far short of the 200 votes required in
    the first round, a target that the government is also certain to miss in next
    week’s second round. However, ahead of the critical third vote on December 29
    when the threshold drops to 180, the government had hoped to gain between 161
    and 165 in the first round in a bid to build momentum for the votes to come.

    Greater China. The Shanghai Composite (top panel) has begun to pause from its
    recent rally as it appears that the parabolic rise is accounted mainly by speculative
    activity in the wake of the Shanghai-HK link-up.By contrast, the other regional
    stock markets of China's major Asian trading partners (middle panels) have not
    confirmed the strength in Chinese stocks as they have all broken their uptrends.
    In addition, the AUDCAD currency cross (bottom panel), which is important as both
    Australia and Canada are resource economies but Australia is more sensitive to
    Chinese growth, is tanking. These are all signs that the market is concerned about
    slowing Chinese growth.

    can de-couple and continue to strengthen in the face of rising global worries.
    In other words, is the current US market rally just a seasonal snap-back rally

    that the Santa Claus rally can continue into year-end and beyond is the nature
    of the market leadership during this period. Will relative strength led by the
    recent high-beta leadership, such as biotechs and semiconductors, which would
    be a sign of continued market strength, or down-and-out groups such as small caps
    and energy, which are the most likely tax-loss selling candidates and whose rallies
    would likely peter out soon?

    groups like energy and small caps start to show relative strength, then the Santa
    Claus rally is most likely to be short-lived and traders should be wary of a post-New
    Year hangover. If, on the other hand, we see continued strength from leading groups
    like the biotechs and semiconductors, then the bull run is far more likely to
    continue.
