# VIX and More: Thanks to All

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/06/thanks-to-all.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/06/thanks-to-all.html#0001-01-01)

Thank you to all who weighed in on [my mother’s passing](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/06/for-my-mother.html).  It is comforting to know that people who I have never met, who live on several continents, and who pray in many different languages all have my family in their thoughts.

A special mention for [Trading Goddess](http://tradinggoddess.blogspot.com/): keep those postcards coming and let your heart be your guide.

It may just be a coincidence, but it seems as if whenever family matters pull me away from the blog, the VIX, like an unsupervised child, starts acting up.  It started on my birthday, [February 27^(th)](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/02/birthday-party.html), and has carried over to this week. Since I have been largely tuned out of the markets for most of the recent action, this seems like a good time to highlight the work of some of my favorite bloggers who have been talking up the VIX in the last day or two:

I will probably be back posting on a regular basis again next week.  In the meantime, be sure to hug someone special and let them know you much you love them.
