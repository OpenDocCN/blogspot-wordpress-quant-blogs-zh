    many questions along the lines of “what does the VIX think about…?” that I hope
    I can be excused for an occasional anthropomorphic slip of the keyboard.

    at the moment, with large commercial banks across the globe breaking down and
    starting to pull the major indices with them. Momentum is decidedly in the bearish
    camp and while today’s volume was of the fair to middling variety, we appear to
    be as close as one or two trading days away from the type of meltdown that could
    make November a fond memory.

    envelopes](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/moving%20average%20envelopes)
    to bracket a [10 day simple moving average](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/10%20day%20SMA).
    The VIX closed 23.3% above the 10 day SMA, clearly at overbought levels, but as
    September and October showed, this is no guarantee we have hit a reversal point.

    measures for the SPX. This too suggests an extremely extended VIX, with 10, 20
    and 30 day historical volatility currently all residing in the 33-37 range.

    which considers some elements that are analogous to the VIX [term structure](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/term%20structure),
    is more neutral, with a slightly bullish reading of 1.032.

    situation I struggled to find analogous data. Only two periods come close to matching
    the present: October 2007, just when the markets were putting in a top; and July
    1993, when the markets were slowly running out of steam, prior the bearish 1994
    that preceded the great bullish leg from 1995-1999.'

- en: All things considered, my best guess is that the VIX is soon to begin suffering
    from oxygen deprivation and is not likely to climb much higher than the current
    altitude, providing some relief to the markets and keeping the SPX above the 770
    level – perhaps even establishing 800 as the new SPX floor. The large pool of
    cash on the sidelines is sure to be tempted at current levels, but will not likely
    chase equities until there are some more convincing signs of a bottom forming.
    The next week or two could well determine whether the balance of the first half
    of 2009 is bullish or bearish.
