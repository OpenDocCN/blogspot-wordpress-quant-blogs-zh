- en: Above are some credits trading well above what is implied by their actual default
    probabilities. If happy days are here again, these are good buys. But know that
    since 1950, if you look at the 20 days closest to the 3.6% jump we had yesterday,
    the future 12 month return on the index was only slightly greater than its average
    over the period. In other word's, one datapoint, a big day, doesn't say so much.
