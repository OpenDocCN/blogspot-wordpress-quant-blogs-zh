    aimed at greater transparency. With a clearing house turning each match into two
    trades, exchanges remove counterparty risk. Tradeable prices can be observed intra
    and end of day, removing the mark to model problem. Outstanding interest in any
    contract is generally published too. Quite complex structures can be built with
    exchange traded contracts – see LIFFE ETO strategies.

    risks ?  What kind of participation should there be in any new exchanges ?  What
    kind of future does Prime Brokerage DMA have ?
