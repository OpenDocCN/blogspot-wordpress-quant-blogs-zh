- en: Our electronic trading system consists of more than 500K lines of C++. There's
    some Java and C# in there too. We have 50 traders using that system to autoquote,
    place and pull orders, autonegotiate RFQs and STP their trades for a dozen ECNs.
    Last year we did 23 releases to the trading floor.

- en: Developers who come from an ISV or shrink wrap background are often completely
    confounded by the way development and deployment works in wholesale banking. They're
    used to long development and release cycles, measured in months and years. They
    think that since our systems are used to trade billions of Euros of bonds, swaps,
    futures and options every day, they must have massively heavyweight QA processes,
    like the [shuttle software](http://www.fastcompany.com/online/06/writestuff.html).

    different from vendorware…

    often tolerate flakiness to get to the business opportunity quicker.

    being cross platform, or which service pack the users are running. We have a single,
    well managed, target infrastructure.

- en: We have the luxury of a dedicated test and release team. There's no way our
    users will test software, they're too busy trading !  Our testers often save us
    developers from getting the hairdryer treatment from a trader by picking up bugs
    before deployment. God bless 'em.

- en: So in many ways developing trading systems is like the new world of web application
    deployment. Paul Graham was [ahead of the game as usual](http://www.paulgraham.com/road.html)
    on this. And like Paul Graham says, we're in very close touch with our users on
    the trading floor. They're quick to let us know when we get it wrong!
