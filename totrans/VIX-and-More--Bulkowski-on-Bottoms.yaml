    I am in my second year of blogging, I have yet to make a reference to Thomas Bulkowski’s
    excellent [Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns](http://www.amazon.com/Encyclopedia-Chart-Patterns-Wiley-Trading/dp/0471668265).  As
    the title suggests, this is more of a reference book than a page turner, yet it
    is an invaluable tool for anyone who is interested in stock charts, whether they
    would classify themselves as a novice or an expert.'

    whether the recent lows are likely to result in a bottom, and what to expect going
    forward if this bottom holds or if it fails.  Bulkowski’s work is an excellent
    place to start, where you can brush up on a wide range of bottoms he has classified
    and analyzed from a trading perspective, including the classic [Head-and-Shoulders
    Bottoms](http://thepatternsite.com/hsb.html), as well as some of the more esoteric
    Bulkowski favorites, such as [Horn Bottoms](http://thepatternsite.com/hornb.html),
    [Pipe Bottoms](http://thepatternsite.com/pipeb.html), [Bump-and-Run Reversal Bottoms](http://thepatternsite.com/barrb.html),
    and a variety of [double bottom chart patterns](http://thepatternsite.com/chartpatterns.html).

    looking at his work and thinking about how one might go about challenging some
    of his thinking will more than compensate most traders for the expense of the
    book.  In the end, I find that there is a fair amount that can be swallowed whole
    and I cannot help but marvel at the meticulous rigor of Bulkowski’s approach,
    a process that hearkens back to my discussion earlier this week about [what makes
    an expert trader](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/01/expert-traders.html).

    he has written (a fourth, [Encyclopedia of Candlestick Charts](http://www.amazon.com/Encyclopedia-Candlestick-Charts-Wiley-Trading/dp/0470182016/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1201804158&sr=1-3)
    is due out in the first week of March), Bulkowski maintains a web site, [The Pattern
    Site](http://thepatternsite.com/), that offers a high level view of his thinking,
    at no charge.

    ready to call a bottom, but the events of the last 48 hours have me thinking that
    the likelihood we are forming a bottom is much higher than most pundits think.
