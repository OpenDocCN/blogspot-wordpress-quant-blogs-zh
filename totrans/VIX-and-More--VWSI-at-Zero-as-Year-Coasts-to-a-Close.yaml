    79%.  Of course, in the absence of a [VIX ETF](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20ETF)
    (or ETN), it was almost impossible for volatility aficionados to capture that
    79% gain.

    week the VIX gained 2.27 points (12.3%) to bring the index to a level just 0.17
    below the 10 day simple moving average and 0.93 below the 20 day SMA.  Partly
    because of this, the VWSI is back at zero and indicating no directional bias for
    the beginning of 2008.

    markets, Barry Ritholtz at [The Big Picture](http://bigpicture.typepad.com/) sums
    up the week that was and the week that will be in his [New Year’s Linkfest](http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2007/12/new-years-linkf.html).

    ask whether the 79% gain in the VIX in 2007 marks the beginning of a [new volatility
    macro cycle](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20macro%20cycles).  In
    spite of the historical precedent, I am on the record as saying that the [most
    likely volatility scenario](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/12/was-2007-beginning-of-new-era-in.html)
    for 2008 is a VIX in the low to mid-20s.

- en: '*****Wine pairing:***  For a VWSI of zero, I began the year recommending some
    [Rhone blends](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Rhone%20blend) and
    later expanded the category to include any [expensive blend](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/inexpensive%20blend).  For
    2007, I will close out the year with my two favorite inexpensive blends: the $8
    Oakley Five Reds (the 2003 vintage is a blend of 41% syrah, 27% zinfandel, 22%
    petite sirah, 10% [alicante bouschet](http://www.winepros.org/wine101/grape_profiles/alicante.htm),
    and 1% mourvedre from [Cline Cellars](http://www.clinecellars.com/)); and the
    2005 vintage of The Hermit Crab from [D’Arenberg](http://www.blogger.com/70%25%20viognier%20and%2030%25%20marsanne),
    a delicious $13 blend of 70% viognier and 30% marsanne.**'
