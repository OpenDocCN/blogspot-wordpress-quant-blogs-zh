    of inflationary expectations. If inflationary expectations rise, then it would
    take a lot of tightening (e.g. Volcker’s painful and tight policies of the early
    1980’s) to get them back down again.

    to rise, then we may be witnessing a sea change in expectations and market tone.
    In such a case, we can expect further downside in the equity and commodity markets.
