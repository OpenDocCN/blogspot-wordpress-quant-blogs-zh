    a certain stock exhibits a true (geometric) random walk, by which I mean there
    is a 50-50 chance that the stock is going up 1% or down 1% every minute. If you
    buy this stock, are you most likely, in the long run, to make money, lose money,
    or be flat?*'

- en: '*Most traders will blurt out the answer “Flat!”, and that is wrong. The correct
    answer is you will lose money, at the rate of 0.5% every minute! That is because
    for a geometric random walk, the average compounded rate of return is not the
    short-term (or one-period) return *m* (1% here), but is *m – s²/2*, where *s*
    (also 1% here) is the standard deviation of the short-term return. This is consistent
    with the fact that the geometric mean of a set of numbers is always smaller than
    the arithmetic mean (unless the numbers are identical, in which case the two means
    are the same). When we assume, as I did, that the arithmetic mean of the returns
    is zero, the geometric mean, which gives the average compounded rate of return,
    must be negative.*'

    In a previous article (“[How much leverage should you use](http://epchan.blogspot.com/2006/10/how-much-leverage-should-you-use.html)?”),
    I described a scheme to maximize the long-run growth rate of a given investment
    strategy (*i.e.*, a strategy with a fixed *m* and *s*) by leveraging. However,
    often we are faced with a choice of different strategies with different expected
    returns and risk. How do we choose between them? Many traders think that we should
    pick the one with the highest Sharpe ratio. This is reasonable if a trader fix
    each of his or her bet to have a constant size. But if you are a trader interested
    in maximizing long-run wealth (like the Kelly investor I mentioned in the previous
    article), the bet size should always be proportional to the compounded return.
    Maximizing Sharpe ratio does not guarantee maximal growth for multi-period returns.
    Maximizing *m – s²/2* does.*'
