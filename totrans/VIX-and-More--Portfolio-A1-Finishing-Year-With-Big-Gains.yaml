    suddenly turned out to be a very successful one, thanks to what is shaping up
    as a very strong finish.  Essentially even on the year at Thanksgiving, Portfolio
    A1 is now up 19.3% just two weeks later, putting a lot of space between the portfolio
    and the benchmark S&P 500 index, which is now showing a 3.4% gain since the portfolio’s
    February 16^(th) inception.

    and a resurgent [DryShips (DRYS)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=drys) have
    helped, the 121% gain in [Mosaic (MOS)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=mos),
    added to the portfolio in mid-August, is the primary reason that the portfolio
    has made such impressive recent gains.

    reverse my previous thinking and continue to highlight it here past the end of
    the year, rather than start a new portfolio from scratch.
