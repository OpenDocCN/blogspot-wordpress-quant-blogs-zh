- en: Most of the buzz in the financial blogosphere has been focused on the actions
    of the Federal Reserve. As a result of Ben Bernanke's announcement of potentially
    unlimited expansion of the Fed's balance sheet, stock prices surged last week.

  zh: 金融博客圈的大部分讨论都集中在美联储的行动上。由于本·伯南克宣布美联储可能会无限制地扩大其资产负债表，上周股价飙升。
- en: Let's step back for a moment and consider the following two relative return
    charts, which are relative to ACWI, the MSCI All-Country World Index ETF. I have
    deliberate removed the labels. Which would you rather own, this one?

  zh: 让我们退后一步，考虑以下两个相对回报图表，它们都是相对于ACWI，即MSCI全球国家指数ETF。我故意去掉了标签。你更愿意拥有哪一个，这张？

- en: I won't keep you in suspense. The first chart is the ratio of FEZ, the ETF representing
    the Euro STOXX 50, against ACWI and the second chart is the ratio of SPY, representing
    American equities, against ACWI. (All are US-listed ETFs denominated in USD, so
    there is no currency effects.)

  zh: 我不会让你悬念。第一张图表是FEZ，代表欧元STOXX 50的ETF与ACWI的比率，第二张图表是SPY，代表美国股市的比率与ACWI。（所有这些都是以美元计价的美国上市ETF，所以没有汇率影响。）
- en: Technically speaking, the rally in the past few weeks has been unusual. Despite
    all the hoopla about the actions of the Fed, it has been European equities that
    have begun to bottom and started to become the leadership. US equities have begun
    to weaken against global equities and started to lag. What's more unusual is emerging
    market equities, which has normally been thought of as a high-beta play, have
    not performed well.

  zh: 从技术上讲，过去几周的上涨行情是不寻常的。尽管所有关于美联储行动的喧嚣，但它一直是欧洲股市开始触底并开始成为领导力量。美国股市相对于全球股市开始疲软并开始落后。更不寻常的是，通常被认为是高贝塔值的新兴市场股市表现不佳。
- en: American investors shouldn't be overly focused on just their own market and
    look for emerging leadership across the Atlantic. To be sure, there are sectors
    like the Homebuilders that remain leaders, as shown by the relative chart below.
    But this is a relatively small weight in the US market and this industry cannot
    be expected to carry the entire US market with it.

  zh: 美国投资者不应该只关注他们自己的市场，并在大西洋彼岸寻找新兴的领导力量。当然，像住宅建筑商这样的板块仍然是领导者，如下面的相对图表所示。但这个在美国市场中的权重相对较小，这个行业不可能带动整个美国市场。
- en: When I look at the heavyweight cyclically oriented sectors, such as Industrials
    (XLI) against ACWI, they appear to have broken down through a relative support
    level - which is not a sign of a healthy market.

  zh: 当我查看重量级的周期性行业，如工业（XLI）对ACWI时，它们似乎已经突破了相对支撑位 - 这不是一个健康市场的迹象。
- en: The same goes for Consumer Discretionary stocks (XLY) against ACWI. XLY has
    formed a similar pattern as SPY of breaking down through a relative uptrend line.

  zh: 对于消费品非必需品股票（XLY）对ACWI也是如此。XLY形成了与SPY类似的模式，即突破相对上升趋势线。
- en: Putting it all together, these charts suggest that global investors are far
    more worried about the fiscal cliff than any eurozone financial crisis. Given
    the giant party being thrown by the Fed and ECB, it seems that people are having
    a better time in Europe than America.

  zh: 将所有信息综合起来，这些图表表明，全球投资者对财政悬崖的担忧远超过对欧元区任何金融危机的担忧。考虑到美联储和欧洲央行正在举行一场盛大的派对，似乎人们在欧洲的时光比在美国要愉快得多。
