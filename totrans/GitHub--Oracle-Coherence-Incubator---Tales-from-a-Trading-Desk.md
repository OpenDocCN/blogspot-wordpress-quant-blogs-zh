# GitHub: Oracle Coherence Incubator | Tales from a Trading Desk

> 来源：[https://mdavey.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/github-oracle-coherence-incubator/#0001-01-01](https://mdavey.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/github-oracle-coherence-incubator/#0001-01-01)

## GitHub: Oracle Coherence Incubator

Brian Oliver notes that Oracle Coherence Incubator 11 is [release](http://brianoliver.wordpress.com/2013/02/26/coherence-incubator-11-released/) – fully Maven’s and [github’d](http://coherence-community.github.com/coherence-incubator/11.0.0/) 🙂  Possibly of interest, the event distribution [pattern:](http://coherence-community.github.com/coherence-incubator/11.0.0/eventdistributionpattern/index.html)

> The purpose of this pattern is to provide an extensible, high-performance, highly-available, general purpose scalable framework to distribute application events occurring in one Coherence Cluster to one or more possibly distributed Coherence Clusters, Caches or other Devices

The [processing](http://coherence-community.github.com/coherence-incubator/11.0.0/processingpattern/index.html) pattern may also be of interesting:

> The Processing Pattern provides a simple mechanism to perform distributed grid computing operations with Coherence. It is structured as an extensible cluster-based processing engine, capable of accepting, dispatching and executing a variety of workloads, the types of which may be customized by developers.
> 
> Unlike the traditional hub-and-spoke / master-worker / broker-agent, the Processing Pattern avoids the classic “single-point-of-failure”, “single-point-of-dispatch”, “single-point-of-contention” problems by managing and distributing the core state across a Coherence Data Grid.
