    is in the tank. It seems that much of this negative outlook has been discounted
    by the market. While the stock fell initially, it rallied to finish positively

    are not seeing gangbusters growth, but there is no indication that the economy
    is keeling over into recession either. The preliminary scorecard from the current
    Earnings Season is telling a similar story. The earnings beat rate is roughly
    in line with the historical average, although the sales beat rate has been somewhat
    disappointing.

    is localized - for now. Barring further weakness in commodity prices and the other
    indicators that I mentioned, the implication is that US stock market action will
    be choppy because of the uncertainty caused by commodity weakness and Earnings
    Season, but any downside will be limited. As the point and figure chart of the
    SPX below shows, the S+P 500 remains in an uptrend and I am inclined to give the
    bull case the benefit of the doubt for now.
