    exist within asset classes they do exist across assets, with the signature example
    of cash, bonds, and equities. Yet, the premium dfrom cash to bonds is more like
    a cash premium, easily explained by the transaction benefits of cash, as opposed
    to any 'risk premium' in bonds. After all, you can pay for most things in cash,
    and that property is worth something. The equity premium of stocks over bonds,
    however, has for decades seemed like obvious proof of 'the risk premium'.

    much less than the S&P500\. But even without that, consider what the equity return
    premium is. It should be a payment for risk, where risk is a covariance with something
    that proxies the happiness of investors.'

    short beta 1.5 stocks, the beta of that portfolio is about -1.0 (find such portfolios

    seems insanely cheap insurance. Basically for this modest fee, you can add it
    to the S&P500 and presto! Beta for your equity investing is now basically zero
    for only a 1% a year! Most of the 'Equity Premium' can be captured by adding this
    costless -1 beta hedge to the S&P500.

    S&P500 itself. What risk factor would this be? The fact that it can only exist
    as a subtle and obscure latent factor makes it inconsistent because it is also
    so vivid it generates a ubiquitous and omnipresent price impact. It's not as absurd
    as a theory based on wanting to kill your father and have sex with your mother,
    but it's up there.
