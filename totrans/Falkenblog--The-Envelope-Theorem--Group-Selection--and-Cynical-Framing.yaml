    important in explaining human behavior. I don't think it explains everything,
    but a lot. Steven Pinker just wrote an

    human soldiers need a lot of prodding to kill themselves for the commonweal. Kin
    selection and reciprocal altruism, for Pinker, are sufficient to explain the superficial
    altruism one sees in society  In the comments section Herb Gintis replies, and
    he's an economist with a long interest in this debate; he favors the importance
    of group selection.

    sure for most instincts, one can rationalize them with selfish and groupish incentives.
     I think a key proof would involve showing  that if you are competing with other
    individuals, it is not an equilibrium for there to be no coalitions; a coalition
    would outperform those not acting in concert, the way a collusion in Texas hold
    'em can dominate non-colluding players.  Thus, it should be hard wired to collude
    because it is a dominant strategy if no one else is doing it, and perhaps even
    if everyone is doing it.

    cynical focus.  First, he says to drop the 'group' prefix because it seems to
    support some 'vague and misguided ideas' that Dennet does not like.  As Jonathan
    Haidt emphasizes patriotism and religiosity of group selection, one can presume
    that's what Dennet is afraid of there.  He then suggests adding the word 'design'
     into the selfish selection mechanism because the 'intelligent design' community
    has stumbled upon a good description of how biologic systems appear (ie, like
    they are designed, as admitted by Dawkins and Pinker), and he hates 'Intelligent
    Design'.

    focusing on higher truths as opposed to discussing ideas at hand, and that is
    a path to cynicism and nihilism. I agree that the big picture matters and very
    occasionally one has to be insincere or misleading to help a higher goal (eg,
    not overly criticizing your leaders when fighting Nazis and the battle is in doubt).
     But  if you make them your primary focus you have simply become a shill for whatever
    big idea you chose years ago.

    levies a health care tax on all citizens, with exemptions for those with health
    care. The mandate wasn't called a tax, but because money is fungible, it is economically
    equivalent to a tax, and so it could be metaphorically considered a tax -- but
