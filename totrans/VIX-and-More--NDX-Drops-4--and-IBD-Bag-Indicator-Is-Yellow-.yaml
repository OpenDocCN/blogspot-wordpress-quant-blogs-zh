    little bit about the [mean reverting](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/mean%20reversion)
    bounce associated with a 3% one day drop in the SPX in [VIX Spikes and SPX Drops
    Are Not Necessarily Two Sides of the Same Coin](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/06/vix-spikes-and-spx-drops-are-not.html).'

- en: Yesterday, we had a 4% drop in the NASDAQ-100 ([NDX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/NDX))
    and, not surprisingly, the 33 year historical record of 4% drops in the NDX suggests
    that a bounce is again likely to follow yesterday’s pain.  What I found particularly
    interesting is that the bounce following a 4% NDX drop has a lifespan of only
    a month or so before any incremental gains revert back to the historical norm.  In
    fact, the maximum post-bounce advantage peaks at about ten trading days, then
    slowly starts to erode.  Looking at data from all 108 of those 4% drops, average
    performance begins to drop after the tenth day and is decidedly bearish during
    the period of 2-6 months after that 4% drop.

    of 4% drops in the NDX that occurred during the 2000-2003 period (accounting for
    75% of all 4% drops during the 33 year period under study), which lends a bearish
    cast to the data.

- en: So what about the IBD bag?  Well…someone decided to start me on a trial subscription
    to [Investor’s Business Daily](http://www.investors.com/) about a week or two
    ago.  I scanned the paper for the first few days and noted with a smile that it
    came wrapped in a green plastic bag.  Yesterday the paper arrived in a yellow
    bag and I wondered if this was some sort of signal from [Bill O’Neil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_O%27Neil)
    or God or perhaps both.  Of course, the markets proceeded to plummet on that yellow
    bag day.  So today I look outside in eager anticipation to see what color the
    bag is and it’s yellow again.  This time the markets are only down about 0.7%,
    but the day is young.  I wonder what it means when the paper arrives in a red
    bag?
