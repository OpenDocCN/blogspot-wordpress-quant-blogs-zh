## PDC 2007: Nothing to Say

Well it appears the [PDC](http://blogs.msdn.com/lokeuei/archive/2007/05/24/pdc-rescheduled.aspx) is off this year.

Scoble has a [view](http://scobleizer.com/2007/05/24/microsoft-cancels-pdc/).  Maybe [MIX](http://www.microsoft.com/events/mix/default.mspx) is the new PDC 🙂  Generally agree with Scoble regards the last few PDC’s, you just have to look at what happened with [WinFS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WinFS) and Vista.  I’m surprised that Microsoft has nothing to talked about regards .NET Framework 4.0, given that Orcas is in beta 1\. The thought of [OSX](http://www.apple.com/macosx/) driving the Windows architecture is somewhat amusing.  Maybe Microsoft should just announce Visual Studio for OSX 😉 and drop Windows Vista completely.
