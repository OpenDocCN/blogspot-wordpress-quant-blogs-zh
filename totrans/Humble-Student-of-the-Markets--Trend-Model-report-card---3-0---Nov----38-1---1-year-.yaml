    asset allocation, model which uses trend following techniques as applied to commodity
    and global stock market prices to generates a composite Risk-On/Risk-Off signal
    (risk-on, risk-off or neutral). I have begun updating readers on the Trend Model
    signals on a weekly basis (for the last weekly comment, see

    the SP 500\. You can think of the blue up arrows, which occurred when the trend
    signal changed from negative to positive, as buy signals and the red down arrows,
    which occurred when the trend signal changed from positive to negative, as sell
    signals.

    interesting, there is no substitute for actual performance. As a proof of concept,
    I started to manage a small account that traded long, inverse and leveraged ETFs
    on the major US market averages and, on occasion, sector and industry ETFs. Trading
    decisions were based on Trend Model signals combined with some short-term sentiment
    indicators. The inception date of the account was September 30, 2013 and the chart
    below represents an interim report card of that account.

    is intended to be an absolute return vehicle. While I do show the SPY total return,
    which includes re-invested dividends, for illustrative purposes, the SP 500 is
    not an appropriate benchmark for measuring the performance of this modeling technique.

- en: To be sure, the Trend Model has benefited from an extremely favorable environment
    as the stock market has more or less risen in a straight line with very few hiccups.
    Under more normal market conditions, where the market can be expected to regularly
    correct 10% or more and move in a more choppy manner, this strategy is unlikely
    to perform as well in sideways and volatile environments. That`s why I had hoped
    to see greater market volatility in order to stress test this model.

    past 13 month of its young life, my best wild-eyed guess of a more reasonable

    instead of the astounding 35-40% experienced so far.
