# Quantifiable Edges: Clusters of large low-volume selloffs

Last August I looked at clusters of large low-volume selloffs. While the S&P hasn’t quite met the parameters

[laid out in that blog post](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2008/08/another-large-low-volume-drop-massive.html)

, it has met the loosened requirements which were looked at in the 8/1/08 Subscriber Letter.

[The Quantifinder](http://www.quantifiableedges.com/quantifinderinfo.html)

picked up on this last night and I thought it was worth another look. The basic concept is as follows. Strong moves down often lead to bounces. When you have a series of them occur on low volume then you may have favorable risk/reward on the long side.

There appeared to be an upside edge when I ran this test last summer and there still appears to be one.
