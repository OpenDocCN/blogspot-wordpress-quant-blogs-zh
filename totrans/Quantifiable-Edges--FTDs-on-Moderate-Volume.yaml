- en: Total NYSE volume was down slightly but Nasdaq volume rose on Tuesday.  Using
    the original 1% gain rules that we used to create our Follow Through Day (FTD)
    database, this meant Tuesday did see a FTD in the Nasdaq.  But what happens when
    volume rises to trigger a FTD, but it is still light?  This is one concept I looked
    at in last night’s subscriber letter.  To answer this question I looked at all
    FTDs where volume came in below its 10ma.

- en: The inclinations over the 1st few days here appear moderately bearish.  The
    stat at the bottom is interesting, and suggests the rally attempts often fail
    when FTDs don’t come on strong volume. And for those that may be curious, the
    success rate rises to 56% when volume comes in above its 10ma.
