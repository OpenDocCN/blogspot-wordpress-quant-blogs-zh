# Magmasystems Blog: Is Oracle a Threat to Java

[Oracle sues Google](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2010/08/oracle-sues-google-over-use-of-java-in-android-sdk.ars)

over the use of Java.

I really don't follow what is happening in the Java community. But, any IT woker on Wall Street knows that there are an awful lot of trading systems whose server-side processing is written in Java. Many of those system rely on open-source efforts that may eventually come under fire by Oracle.

Will this also affect alternate Java VM implementations that are used in trading systems?
