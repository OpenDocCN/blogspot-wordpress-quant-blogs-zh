- en: With all the turmoil in Europe, I thought it would be interesting to check on
    some of the single country ETFs for those nations which have been closest to the
    sovereign debt crisis. The chart below, courtesy of [ETFreplay.com](http://etfreplay.com/),
    captures the year-to-date price movements and (historical) volatility for the
    likes of [Germany](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Germany), France,
    [Italy](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Italy) and [Spain](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Spain).

- en: Not surprisingly, Germany has held up the best and Spain has been the worst
    performer in 2010\. France, which had been tracking fairly close to Germany, has
    fallen into second as the country’s bank exposure to Greece has saddled France
    with additional risk. Italy, which has been on the periphery of the contagion
    concerns, has fared only slightly better than Spain and has actually been the
    worst performer of the four during the last month and a half as the crisis has
    deepened.

    performance in these countries, as the largest moves have been negative ones.
