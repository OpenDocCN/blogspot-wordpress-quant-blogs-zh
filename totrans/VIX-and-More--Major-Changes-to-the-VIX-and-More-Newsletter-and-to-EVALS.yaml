- en: Back in July I moved the publication of the VIX and More newsletter from Sundays
    to Wednesdays, due to subscriber feedback. At the time I also dramatically changed
    the focus of the newsletter content, again based on subscriber feedback, placing
    an increased emphasis on the analysis of [VIX ETPs](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20ETN)
    and ideas about how to trade them.

    so that it now focuses almost exclusively as a model portfolio for VIX ETPs.

    more tightly and also have EVALS complement and extend the analysis found in the
    newsletter.
