- en: In looking back at 2009, investors who were fortunate enough to [time the March
    bottom](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/03/spx-at-687-intermediate-bottom.html)
    have been able to take advantage of most or all of 68% gain in the S&P 500 index
    since that bottom. While stocks have been on a tear for the past 9 ½ months, I
    would hazard to guess that quite a few investors do not realize that for the most
    part, junk bonds have performed as well as equities during this period.

    below, I show the almost identical performance of SPY (SPDR S&P 500 ETF) and [JNK](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/JNK),
    a junk bond ETF formally known as the SPDR Barclays Capital High Yield Bond ETF
    ([holdings](https://www.spdrs.com/product/fund.seam?ticker=JNK)). Amazingly, since
    the March 9^(th) bottom in stocks, JNK has matched SPY step for step – and with
    less volatility.

    ETFs such as JNK and [HYG](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/HYG) will
    keep pace with stocks going forward. At the very least, these ETFs offer investors
    some portfolio diversification and less volatility – even though these are an
    extremely risky asset class.
