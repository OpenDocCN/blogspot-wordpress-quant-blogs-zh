    is struggling with technical resistance and has underperformed gold (again). What
    happened to the story about a better leverage to the gold price?

- en: . Gold stocks are underperforming because their cost of production is going
    up, which creates a headwind for earnings - a driver of stock price. Yes, the
    value of what they have in the ground has gone up, but so has the cost of what
    it costs to take it out of the ground.

    gold with a $600 strike will give you a projected gain of about 300%. If you change
    the strike to $900, the projected gain is about 550%.

    and their resultant pattern of disappointing leverage, gains are likely to be
    200% or less. An investor would be taking on more volatility risk but at the price
    of little or no incremental gain.

    stocks.
