    (hey, it’s better than a house full of cats…) that no person in their right mind
    should ever bother with, but every now and then one speaks to me in a convincingly
    enough fashion that I keep going back to it.

- en: So here I am with the VIX:SDS ratio chart again.  Alan Greenspan says that the
    holy grail of market forecasting is a [fear vs. euphoria indicator](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/09/test.html).  Frankly,
    this one is good enough for me – at least for the moment.  Given that the [SDS
    ETF](http://www.proshares.com/funds/sds) has only been around since [July 2006](http://seekingalpha.com/article/13368-shorts-rejoice-double-inverse-etfs-to-begin-trading-thursday),
    there is little in the way of historical information with which to do some backtesting,
    but I like how the VIX:SDS ratio has been acting during the recent market action.  The
    ratio may not be a perfect way to decompose the fear and volatility components
    of the VIX, but it certainly offers a fair share of clues.  One way to look at
    the current reading, for instance, would be to interpret only a small fear premium
    built into the ratio vis-à-vis the more ‘normal’ sentiment expressed by the 100
    day SMA.
