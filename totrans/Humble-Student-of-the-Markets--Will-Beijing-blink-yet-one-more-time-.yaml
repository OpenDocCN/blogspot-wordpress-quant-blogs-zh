    high of 94 basis points over similar contracts based on repurchase agreements,

    the situation in China now and that in the U.S. before the 2008 financial crisis,
    when traders gauged lending appetite by monitoring the difference between the
    London Interbank Borrowing Rate and the overnight indexed swap. Premier Li Keqiang’s
    efforts to curb leverage in the world’s second-largest economy by driving up borrowing
    costs need to be handled carefully to avoid wrecking confidence in the financial
    system, according to Nomura Holdings Inc.

    the past few weeks. Sure, inter-bank rates and corporate bond yields have significantly
    increased over the past year. But if you include things such as central bank injections
    into the inter-bank market and unsterilised foreign exchange purchases – where
    the central bank buys foreign currency to maintain the partial dollar peg – it’s
    clear there’s been no net tightening at all.

    be enough to put that to bed. January lending was the highest in four years. More
    worryingly, total societal financing – a broad measure of credit including shadow
    financing – increased to 2.58 trillion yuan, smashing analyst estimates of 1.9
    trillion yuan. China remains addicted to credit despite the racheting up of rates.

    accelerate structural reforms laid out late last year 3) lower Beijing’s bottom
