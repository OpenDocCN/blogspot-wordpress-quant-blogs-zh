# VIX and More: Looking at Coronavirus Cases per Million, by Country

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2020/03/looking-at-coronavirus-cases-per.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2020/03/looking-at-coronavirus-cases-per.html#0001-01-01)

The graphic below highlights the countries which have been hit hardest on a per capita basis.

Using this criterion,

[Iceland](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Iceland)

is the country where the coronavirus is most prevalent, followed by

[Italy](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Italy)

,

[South Korea](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/South%20Korea)

,

[Iran](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Iran)

,

[China](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/China)

and

[Switzerland](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Switzerland)

.

These six countries stand out as having passed an inflection point.

Given the data out of Western Europe in the past 48 hours, it appears as if

[Spain](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Spain)

,

[Sweden](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Sweden)

,

[France](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/France)

and

[Denmark](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Denmark)

are not far behind.

The U.S. currently ranks 41

^(st)

in terms of cases per million, with just 1/100

^(th)

of the penetration in Iceland.

Assuming the distribution of new cases continues to trace a parabolic path, being able to reasonably estimate the terminal penetration rate – which will no doubt vary by country – could help to set expectations about the progress and timeline of new cases.

Finally, to follow up on yesterday’s post, I am now dating the first day of 100 new cases in the U.S. at March 7

^(th)

.

Using the 8-14 day window for 100 new cases to peak new cases means the U.S. could see peak new cases in the March 15

^(th)

– March 22

^(nd)

time frame, with an outside shot of the peak extending out to March 29

^(th)

.

Of course, this projection are merely an extrapolation from the experience in other countries and will be largely dependent upon the rate at which testing is ramped up in the U.S.
