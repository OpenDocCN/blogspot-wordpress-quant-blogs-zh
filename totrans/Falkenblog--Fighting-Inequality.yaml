    and libraries. Spending on these items, per capita, has risen over time. It seems
    indefensible to assert that the problem is a lack of money, given we spent half
    as much 50 years ago, failing districts like Los Angeles and Washington DC have
    some of the highest per pupil spending, I don't see how money is the problem.

    ergo, less inequality creates prosperity. It''s a pretext because I think the
    main reason most liberals want to tax the rich more and have bureaucrats spend
    it is simply to bring the wealthy down a notch, why they really don''t care that
    historically spending on education doesn''t increase learning: that''s not the

    we don''t expel troublemakers, we don''t fail under-performing kids, we don''t
    encourage specialized advanced curriculum. The result are schools teaching to
    the lowest common denominator, and classes distracted with behavioral issues that
    overwhelm any potential for learning. Any parent with the wherewithal moves to
    districts where such anarchy has a lower level of dysfunction, and leaves this
    mess for those unable to move, so these inner city schools become extremely dysfunctional.
    Kids at poor schools realize diplomas from such institutions don''t mean anything,
    and drop out more frequently, lowering their ultimate human capital acquisition.'

    treating unequals the same in the school. The failure of public schools is lamented
    as a result of inadequate funding, which is totally orthogonal to the drivers
    of their poor performance.

- en: What makes private institutions excellent is that they have the right to exclude
    those who ruin it for everyone. They require an investment by their consumers
    so they don't take these things for granted, but rather respect their access.
     This should give those at the bottom an incentive to do well, and a place to
    go if they do well. In contrast, by making all their public opportunities non-exclusive
    regardless of behavior, everything is lessened and individuals have less incentive
    to become better persons to get access to these better things, and also ruin it
    for everyone else. My city library is way station for noisy kids, so I never hang
    out there.

- en: Most liberal think prioritizing equality in education, crime, and parks, is
    an obvious way to increase our wealth, which not coincidentally takes the rich
    down a notch, unaware that these same policies just make inequality not as much
    within schools as between them. Forcing everyone to have the same public school/library/healthcare
    will merely create a two tier systems and raises costs for everyone. There are
    lots of things we can do to help our infrastructure and public objectives right
    now, but they aren't nearly as popular because they don't take power away from
    the rich and give it to bureaucrats (eg, allow nurses to distribute penicillin,
    allow power plants to invest in the best technology, don't force refineries to
    use ethanol, give students education vouchers). The failure of past government
    policies is a poor reason for a larger government.
