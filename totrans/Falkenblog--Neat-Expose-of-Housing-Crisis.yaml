    was a train wreck waiting to happen. In 2000 the Head of Fannie Mae bragged about
    pledging $1 trillion in capital to 'underserved' populations. in 2004 Bush promoted
    a Zero Down Payment Program, designed to help minorities who often couldn't afford
    down payments. The US Department of Housing and Urban Development put pressure
    on lenders to purchase home loans for 'low-income and minority' families. Groups
    like ACORN would demand loans to poor areas, and via the Community Reinvestment
    Act, these shakedowns would work (Obama is a

    back in 1992, based on the simple fact that blacks have fewer homes than whites.
    That article has been widely criticized but it was the right message and the right
    time, and regardless of quality has been used to buttress an agenda (criticisms
    are ''details''). The article was not so important in itself because something
    like it was inevitable given the zeitgeist considered this a cheap and easy fix:
    give poor minority groups homes via mortgages. It wouldn''t cost the government
    a dime. The problem of giving people homes who could not afford them would only
    be exposed when the collateral prices fell, but it is interesting how long this
    can take. In effect, this cake took 15 years to bake, and critics who might have
    pointed out the problem in 1993, by 2006 would have been ''proven wrong'' (back
    in the nineties advocates of giving the poor loans via special treatment was considered
    empirically refuted).'

    the underwriting criteria, like credit history and employment, this gap narrowed,
    but was not eliminated. But he did not control for everything a bank looks at,
    so, if you have 7 criteria, and look at 4, and find this does not cover the gap,
    maybe, just maybe, the other three criteria are not neutral? Nope. Clear evidence
    lenders hate disadvantaged minorities more than they like profits. Later, more
    indepth studies by the Fed found no evidence of discrimination, especially when
    one looks at defaults, as opposed to rejections(eg, Berkovec et al, Review of
    Economics and Statistics, 1994). But the politics were obvious. Unlike the 1992
    research finding discrimination, however, the avalanche of latter null results
    by Fed researchers were always accompanied by strong wording that the results
    were too preliminary for any action (eg, slowing or stopping their aggressive
    lending programs targeted at minorities and minority communities). The Fed commissioned
    a set of special pieces on the 'debate', with the clear implication that 'experts
    disagree', and so best to assume from a policy perspective that racial discrimination
    is real. The Fed was defensive about their research that banks did not discriminate.
    One government official prominently noted that as the loan application view is
    more agreeable to the view this is discrimination, then
