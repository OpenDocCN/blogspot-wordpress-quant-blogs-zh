    must admit that when [Milton Friedman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Friedman)
    died last November, it was the first time that I stopped to think about the [money
    supply](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_supply) in several years.  Of course,
    I hadn’t really given any thought at all to the VIX at that time and starting
    a blog was just about the furthest thing from my mind...'

    there was a constant drone about how global liquidity had all but snuffed out
    volatility; and with some [interesting comments](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/04/when-is-echo-volatility-safely-behind.html)
    cropping up on *VIX and More* this morning (thanks to 'F'), it seems like time
    I turned at least some attention to the subject, even if I do so with a substantial
    knowledge deficit.

    dedicated entirely to global liquidity issues and I have spent a little time in
    the past hour or two reading up on the [US money supply](http://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/fedpoint/fed49.html).  For
    those in need of a quick refresher on the money supply, [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_supply)
    has a good overview and Anna Schwartz has an excellent [article and links](http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/MoneySupply.html).
    Quicken has a [Money Supply for Dummies](http://www.quicken.com/cms/viewers/article/investments/5271)
    quickie for those without ego issues and The [Ludwig von Mises](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_von_Mises)
    Institute has an [interesting perspective](http://www.mises.org/story/1956).

    and the VIX from 1990 to the present.  It doesn’t tell me much, but I include
    the graph here for those who may be interested.

    chart of the (reverse engineered) M3 money supply measure and have included it
    below.  More analysis is needed, but the eye can discern some sort of inverse
    correlation between M3 and the VIX during the past four years.

    now I encourage any lurking monetarists and others with thoughts on liquidity
    and volatility to chime in.
