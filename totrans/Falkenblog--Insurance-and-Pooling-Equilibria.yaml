    equilibria', cases where different types of applicants get into a pool, eventually
    pushing out the 'better' or 'lower cost' people who don't want to subsidize the
    other group. For example, due to

    that markets were inefficient because of this problem. In practice, government
    encourages pooling equilibrium where it was never a problem before by preventing

    creates something pretty simple, as if you can imagine what would happen to insurance
    if it could not price based on risk and allowed people to opt out: healthy people
    would leave in droves, which is why Obama-care made insurance mandatory. Think
    about the lawsuits on disparate impact for mortgage lending in the 1990s, where
    whites were rejected less often than blacks, and this was presumed discriminatory

    literature is so starkly in contrast to not just his politics but his obsession,
    which is increasing the size and scope of government which prioritizes preventing
    firms from rationally discriminating. Remember that in Stiglitz's model, like
    everything else in this literature (he didn't invent it), failure to discriminate
    types somewhat known by participants is what causes all the problems, the 'bad
    equilibria.' I guess that highlights no one takes these models very seriously--change
    one assumption here or there, different result.
