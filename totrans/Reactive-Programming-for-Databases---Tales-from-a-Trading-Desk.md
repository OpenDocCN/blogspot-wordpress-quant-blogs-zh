## Reactive Programming for Databases

Slashdot has an interesting [article](http://slashdot.org/topic/bi/why-reactive-programming-for-databases-is-awesome/) by Val Huber.  Espresso Logic web site [provides](http://www.espressologic.com/) more detail on Reactive Service for SQL Data, which primarily creates REST API’s over [databases](http://www.espressologic.com/tour/), with the REST API injected into the path to the database, and thus offering the [reactive](http://www.espressologic.com/reactive-programming-database-logic/) layer.  No surprise to find [JavaScript](http://docs.espressologic.com/docs/tutorial) as the language of choice for the business logic (reactive layer).  Architecture overview available [here.](http://docs.espressologic.com/docs/architecture)

> Expose your enterprise data as RESTful APIs to customers and partners with complete row and field-level security – no programming
