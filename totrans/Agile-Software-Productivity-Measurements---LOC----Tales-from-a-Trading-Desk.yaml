- en: One of the historical ways of measure software productivity is to look at the
    Lines of Code ([LOC](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?LinesOfCode)) produced be day/week/iteration. 
    Looking at software productivity from a agile perspective, we have the velocity
    and burndown from a team perspective, which over time provides a view of the story
    points that are achievable from a delivery perspective per iteration (sprint).

    of the delivered story – clearly there is an implication due to the order of the
    backlog, and the fact that it went through the process.

    cycle changes (wording, acceptance criteria, defects, business value) in a consistent
    manner, then we could identify the productivity of the story from conception to
    delivery, coupled with the various silo’s the story went though in terms of bugs
    generated per story, change request on the story, etc.

    iteration that when released to production, provide little business value, compared
    to delivery 3 story points because the other 7 story points where deemed irrelevant
    to develop because further analysis identify zero ROI, but the 3 story points
    delivered to product provided a 10% increase in business value?\
