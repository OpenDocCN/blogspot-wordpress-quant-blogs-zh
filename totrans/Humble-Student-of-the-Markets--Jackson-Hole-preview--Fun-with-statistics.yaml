    expectations had tracked each other well but started to diverge in the mid 1990's.

    paper co-authored by Yellen’s husband, Nobel prize-winner George Akerlof, who
    wrote that “when inflation is low, it may be at most a marginal factor in wage
    and price decisions, and decision-makers may ignore it entirely.”

    is likely to tilt towards a take-it-slow view on raising interest rates. However,
    I would argue that this analytical framework is highly sensitive to how the Fed
    picks its input variables. One wrong move could result in a policy error of major
    proportions.
