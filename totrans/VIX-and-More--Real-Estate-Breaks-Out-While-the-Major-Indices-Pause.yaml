- en: A wave of buying in the last ten minutes pushed the major indices to small gains
    today, following a day of lackluster trading. Stocks caught a bid early in the
    session following the announcement of a 3.6% increase in pending home sales for
    the month of June. While the broad indices bounced around near the unchanged mark
    all day, [real estate](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/real%20estate)
    was strong throughout the day, with [IYR](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/IYR),
    the popular real estate ETF, gaining 4.8% on the day.
