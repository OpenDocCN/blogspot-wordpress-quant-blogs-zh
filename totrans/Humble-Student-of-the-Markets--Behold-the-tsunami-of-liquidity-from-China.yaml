    measuring the Vancouver-Victoria premium. Vancouver has seen three waves of Chinese
    money coming in over the past few decades. First, there was a wave of Taiwanese
    immigration in the late 1980s. Ahead of the 1997 British handover of Hong Kong
    to China, there was an additional flood of money flooding into the Vancouver property
    market. Today, we are seeing the effects of Mainland Chinese funds flooding into
    Vancouver, as per the comments from real estate agents in the story quoted above.

    to Victoria. A correction could see prices plunge further as downturns often overshoot
    the fair value estimate. Both the Taiwan and Hong Kong buying episodes saw prices
    rise to a premium and a correction afterwards. Does this mean that Vancouver property
    prices are on the verge of collapse?
