    last four years, though they have somewhat moderated their underweight. By contrast,
    consensus mutual funds have moved to a slight overweight in the sector.

    tend to trade at about book value. Today, most are trading at 1.6 to 1.7 times
    book. JPM and C moved to a price/book of 1 in the recent turmoil, but they are
    financial conglomerates and not pure brokers.

    Under SFAS 157, it is appropriate for you to consider actual market prices, or
    observable inputs, even when the market is less liquid than historical market
    volumes, ***unless those prices are the result of a forced liquidation or distress
    sale***. Only when actual market prices, or relevant observable inputs, are not
    available is it appropriate for you to use unobservable inputs which reflect your
    assumptions of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability."'

    ransparency. The whole reason to require banks to mark their assets to market
    price rather than mark to model was to provide shareholders and other lenders
    transparency as to the real capital assets of a bank or company. Second, can a
    forced liquidation or distress sale be from a margin call? Obviousy [sic] the
    answer is yes. but as Barry Ritholtz points out, this opens the door for some
    rather blatant potential manipulation. If a bank makes a margin call to hedge
    funds or their clients to make the last price of a similar derivative on their
    own books look like a forced liquidation, do they then get to not have to value
    the paper at its market price? Is this not an incentive to make margin calls?
    One price for my customers and a different one for the shareholders? If a hedge
    fund was forced to sell assets and then they find out that the investment bank
    is valuing them differently on their books than the price at which they were forced
    to sell, there will be some very upset managers and investors. Cue the lawyers.
