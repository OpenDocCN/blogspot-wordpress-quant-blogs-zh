    constructive on the stock market's outlook for several reasons. First, the market
    sold off on the open, but rallied into the close - a positive sign.

    the negative news. Consider this chart of the relative performance of small caps
    against the large caps indicating that the risk-on trade may not be done yet.

- en: As the chart from UBS strategist Jonathan Golub shows, the classic defensive
    sectors, such as health care and consumer staples, led the way during the first
    three months of the year, while some of the more cyclical sectors, such as energy
    and tech, lagged near the bottom of the pack.

    Value stocks have been outperforming Growth stocks since last June. The chart

    of sectors that have been outperforming, such as Financials and Utilities and

    such as the cyclically sensitive Industrials and Technology.

    at MSCI Barra indicated to me that their factor analysis shows the performance
    of Value factors like Book to Price and Dividend yield to be outperforming as
    well. That outperformance was net of industry effects.
