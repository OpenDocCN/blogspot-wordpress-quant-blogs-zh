    constructive on the stock market's outlook for several reasons. First, the market
    sold off on the open, but rallied into the close - a positive sign.

    the negative news. Consider this chart of the relative performance of small caps
    against the large caps indicating that the risk-on trade may not be done yet.

    sectors, such as health care and consumer staples, led the way during the first

    of sectors that have been outperforming, such as Financials and Utilities and
    the Russell 1000 Growth Index is overweight the sectors that have been lagging,
    such as the cyclically sensitive Industrials and Technology.

    at MSCI Barra indicated to me that their factor analysis shows the performance
    of Value factors like Book to Price and Dividend yield to be outperforming as
    well. That outperformance was net of industry effects.
