    am looking ahead to next week’s FOMC meeting, where the Fed will be more interested
    in economic data rather than corporate earnings.

- en: The chart shows that manufacturing and employment are no longer providing positive
    surprises relative to expectations, while data related to the consumer reflect
    consumer activity that is plodding at best. Housing and construction data, which
    had been a source of positive surprises in 2010, has shown some recent strength,
    but it is too early to consider this development any sort of new trend.

    much less in the way of positive surprises than 2010 – at least in the first four
    months.
