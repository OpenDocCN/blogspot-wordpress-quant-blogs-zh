    AI, realise they often don’t have a big data issue, they have a data quality issue, which
    is probably coupled to data holes within the corporate data set.  This is driven
    by a number of issues, including:'

    recruitment.  Using a secondary copy of the SoT can often lead to “issues”

- en: Context around data changes in the SoT.  Specifically, who changed what, when,
    and ideally why.  “Why” can be difficult in certain instances, but ideally would
    provide some context on the path that lead to a data change e.g phone call from
    a client requesting an amendment to a trade

    then its going to help considerably if the input data leverages a taxonomy to
    reduce the surface area of data.

     Further, if you are using ELK or similar as a data source for AI models, its
    will not be uncommon to find that application development didn’t consider the
    logs during development 😦  In this scenario, I’d advise mandating ELK to development
    teams 🙂  At a minimum, this will aid the reduction of support tickets as support
    staff will at least have meaningful log files to work with 🙂
