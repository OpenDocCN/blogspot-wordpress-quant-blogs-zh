    neither do I for the most part, but I’m quickly coming around to futures as a
    useful tool for getting a better handle on how investors are thinking about and
    betting on the future.

    offer one chart, which comes courtesy of the [CFE](http://cfe.cboe.com/default.aspx).  I
    will skip the commentary, other than to translate the obvious into some numbers:  when
    the VIX jumped 64% from February 26^(th) to February 27^(th), the nearest futures,
    the [March ’07 VIX](http://cfe.cboe.com/Publish/ScheduledTask/MktData/datahouse/CFE_H07_VX.csv),
    moved less than half as much in percentage terms.  Looking further out, the [August
    ’07 VIX](http://cfe.cboe.com/Publish/ScheduledTask/MktData/datahouse/CFE_Q07_VX.csv)
    futures moved about *one tenth* of the VIX index, while the [November ’07 VIX](http://cfe.cboe.com/Publish/ScheduledTask/MktData/datahouse/CFE_X07_VX.csv)
    futures moved about *one* *thirtieth* as much as the VIX did.'
