    I think economists use the concept of efficiency in a slapdash manner. I think
    they make a fetish of rigorous mathematics even when they gain no insight from
    it; it's too often imported as a tool to impress others, rather than as a legitimate
    means to understanding (see the absurd Appendices of

    I think economists (most of them) don''t make use of enough modern mathematics
    from dynamical systems theory.'

    values, even while mistakenly and dangerously believing otherwise (as a result
    of their training). I think the modelling assumption of rational expectations,
    for agents dealing with anything but the simplest environments, is just a silly
    idea. I would go so far as to say that I think many economists don't appreciate
    basic elements of scientific method, preferring the logical beauty (?) of deductive
    theories to empirically relevant ones. Etc. Read almost anything I've written
    on this blog for similarly critical opinions.

    some of it even beautiful. And I think economists themselves should do a better
    job standing up for it. Some very prominent and well known economists are giving
    the field a bad name. Let me explain.
