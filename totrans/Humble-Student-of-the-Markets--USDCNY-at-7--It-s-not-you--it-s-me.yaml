    the rate of 7 to 1 to the USD. The move was positioned as retaliation for Trump`s
    new tariffs. In addition, China has halted all purchase of American agricultural
    goods.

    chart below of the Chinese yuan ETF shows that it had been unusually strong compared
    to the trade weighted dollar. Viewed in this context, the PBOC devaluation in
    2015 was fully justified. Today's fall is reflective a decision by the PBOC to
    stop leaning against the market winds.
