    for decades it seems, and she''s a pretty solid author in this field. Indeed,
    as de Prado is associated with the Tudor Hedge fund, and they are OK with him
    publishing this, that highlights this information is not valuable in and of itself.
    But, lots of useful tools are not obviously translatable into money, so this is
    not a big knock.'

    which are assumed to when the price of a trade is greater than or equal to the
    last trade price, Vs, or Volume of Sells, otherwise. Thus, the greater the imbalance
    of buys vs sells in the past, say, 10000 shares traded, the greater this metric.
    These all occur within the past V shares traded in any bucket. n is the number
    of number of buckets in the sample. Thus, the estimation is in transaction space,
    not time space, which the authors assert is more stable and meaningful.

    that as the log of the VPIN goes up, the dispersion of price moves increases.
    It's not a perfect relationship, but nothing important is.

- en: The point is that in fast moving markets, one needs something a little better
    than simple historical moving averages of daily closing prices. This is better,
    and extending the idea of 'volume time' vs. 'chronological time' is an intriguing
    direction. But one can also look at bid-ask spreads directly, or the VIX futures,
    or its etf, the VXX, and combinations, to gauge intraday volatility as well. Further,
    one can better estimate 'buy volume' using the transaction price relative to the
    then extant bid-ask spread, rather than if the price was weakly increasing, though
    this then involves syncing the trade information with quote information, and for
    academics such data are often hard to come by (further, quote information is often
    10 times as large).

  zh: 在快速变动的市场中，人们需要的不仅仅是简单的历史日收盘价的移动平均值。这种方法更好，将'成交量时间'与'历史时间'的概念延伸开来是一个有趣的方向。而人们也可以直接观察买卖价差，或者观察VIX期货，或者它的交易所交易基金VXX，以及这些指标的组合，来评估盘中波动性。另外，人们可以更好地估计'买入量'，使用的是交易价格相对于当时的买卖价差，而不是价格是否有弱涨，尽管这会涉及将交易信息与报价信息同步，对于学术界来说这些数据往往难以获得（此外，报价信息往往是交易信息的十倍）。
