## HFT Architecture

Following on from the recent Dark Pools posting, [ACMQ](http://queue.acm.org/index.cfm) offers a few HFT [articles](http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?ref=rss&id=2536492) that provide some insight from the perspective of feed handlers, gateways, ticket plants and the order book queues.  One-pass algorithms are also discussed in this [article](http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2534976).
