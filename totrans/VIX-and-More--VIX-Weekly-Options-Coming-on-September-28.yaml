    that it will begin trading [weekly options](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/weekly)
    on VIX futures as of Tuesday, September 28\. Please note that unlike standard
    monthly [VIX options](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20options)
    which expire on Wednesdays, the weekly VIX options will expire on Fridays, as
    is the case with other weekly options. Also, settlement for weekly options will
    feature physical settlement - one futures contract for each expiring options contract.
    [Thanks to Chris McKhann for highlighting this important clarification.]

- en: With the addition of weeklys to the VIX options stable, the proliferation of
    tradable VIX products has the potential to overwhelm and confuse investors. For
    example, in just three weeks we will have VIX futures options and [VXX options](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX%20options)
    expiring on the same date. The former will trade off of the [VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures);
    the latter is based on iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN ([VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX)),
    which is a weighted portfolio of front month and second month VIX futures.

    trades, including a VXX-VIX options pair that has the potential to be able to
    isolate the [contango](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/contango) and
    [backwardation](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/backwardation) components
    of VXX using VIX options with an identical expiration date.
