    of things, perhaps foremost for his assertion in the 1960s of the Efficient Markets
    Hypothesis. A million people (

    for a half-century of detailed empirical studies of financial markets. Way back
    in 1963, in fact, it was Fama who took pains in his very first published paper
    to bring attention to the work of Benoit Mandelbrot on what we now call "fat tails"
    in the distribution of financial returns. I may have known this before, but I
    had forgotten and only relearned it when watching

    clear description of Mandelbrot's empirical studies on price movements in commodities
    markets, showing a preponderance of large, abrupt movements -- far more than would
    be expected by the Gaussian or normal statistics assumed at the time. He explored
    Mandelbrot's hypothesis that the true empirical distributions might be fit by
    "Stable Paretian" distributions, which we today call "Stable Levy" distributions,
    for which statistical measures of fluctuations, such as the mean square variance,
    may be formally infinite. All of this 48 years ago.

- en: How did Fama know about Mandelbrot so early on, when the rest of the economics
    profession took so long to take notice (and in many cases still haven't)? It turns
    out that Mandebrot visited Chicago for several months in 1963 and he and Fama
    spent much time discussing the former's empirical work. As Fama says in the interview,
    he's always been convinced that a lot of research depends on serendipity. Good
    example.

    Stable Levy distributions aren't in fact adequate for describing the empirical
    distribution of market returns. If we define the return R(t) over some time interval
    t as the logarithm of the ratio of prices, s(t)/s(0) -- this makes the return
    be centered roughly about zero -- then the distribution of R has been found in
    all markets studied to have power law tails with P(R) inversely proportional to
    R raised to a power α = 4, at least approximately. See

    another matter. Fama clearly saw the deep importance of the power law deviation
    from Gaussian regularity, noting that it implies a market with much more unruly
    fluctuations than one would expect in a Gaussian world. As he put it,
