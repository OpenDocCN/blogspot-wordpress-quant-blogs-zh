    by Butler, Philbrick and Gordillo this summer: [Adaptive Asset Allocation](http://www.macquarieprivatewealth.ca/dafiles/Internet/mgl/ca/en/advice/specialist/darwin/documents/darwin-adaptive-asset-allocation.pdf
    "Adaptive Asset Allocation PDF"). One of the core principles of  AAA is that portfolio
    allocation should be dynamic versus strategic– in other words, an investor’s portfolio
    composition should adapt over time to respond to changes in both the expected
    return of different asset classes and also the overall risk of the portfolio.
     This theoretically ensures that investors can adequately grow and preserve their
    capital and withdraw to meet liabilities through different economic regimes (deflation,
    inflation, and many other variants).'

- en: The alluring promise of AAA rests upon the ability to dynamically adjust to
    different economic conditions. In a world where assets compete for capital, the
     best way to forecast economic conditions is to observe the relative pricing of
    the most liquid securities across markets.  The time series of major asset classes
    represent observed variables that allow investors to detect changes in the economy.
    Equity markets give us the ability to observe expected business conditions, commodities
    give us the ability to observe expected changes in inflation, while bonds give
    us the ability to observe expected changes in interest rates. Real Estate is a
    market that provides insight into all three factors, and is a direct measure of
    consumer purchasing power.  Observing world equity markets can tell us how business
    conditions are evolving globally.  These asset classes are akin to a diverse ecosystem
    where different species thrive at different times due to changes in the environment.
     If we can detect shifts in the system, we can understand in a probabilistic sense
    which species will do the best across a range of likely scenarios.  By analyzing
    the financial network of asset classes,  it is possible to express our views more
    concisely through a portfolio allocation across assets that maximizes the chance
    of being right while minimizing the cost of being wrong.

- en: The analysis of major assets classes through time series data requires integrating
    historical returns, correlations and measurements of volatility to create an efficient
    portfolio allocation. The goal of this framework is to dynamically identify the
    best performing asset classes and to manage risk at the portfolio level. The paper
    presents an example of a strategy (not the actual proprietary strategy) that effectively
    integrates these three variables into simple  and robust framework. The logic
    for this example is very straightforward yet powerful in its simplicity and is
    validated by academic research. Momentum is chosen as the method to integrate
    expected returns information since the rank of historical returns (versus the
    raw return) represents a robust method of dynamically identifying  which assets
    will perform the best in the near future (2 weeks to 3 months). It is currently
    well-accepted by even the greatest skeptics that momentum is a powerful and reliable
    anomaly.  Minimum-variance optimization (MVO) is chosen as the method to manage
    risk at the portfolio level. It is well-accepted that MVO is effective at managing
    portfolio risk because it minimizes variance as a function of both  asset cross-correlations
    and volatilities. Since MVO does not use expected returns and instead relies on
    the highly forecastable elements of volatility and correlation, it is considerably
    more robust  to estimation error than classic mean-variance optimization and performs
    better out of sample in terms of  ex-post sharpe than all other existing conventional
    portfolio algorithms. Besides the theoretical appeal of MVO, these claims have
    also been validated by numerous academic studies.

- en: The test presented in the paper uses a 6-month parameter (120-day) for momentum
    that selects the top 50% of asset classes and uses a weighted version of minimum-variance
    with an approximate lookback of 20 days to calculate portfolio allocations. The
    holding period for rebalancing was monthly. The obvious question is whether this
    particular combination of momentum and minimum-variance parameters were “lucky”
    and whether this represents a particular case of data snooping.  The charts below
    summarize backtests that were run from 1995 to 2012 using the assets provided
    in the whitepaper with different momentum (ROC) and minimum-variance (MINVAR)
    parameters. What is clear from the tables is that the performance in absolute
    (CAGR) and risk-adjusted terms (Gross Sharpe) is very consistent across parameters.
    While performance is more sensitive to the momentum parameters than minimum-variance,
    both are very stable. It is quite rare in system development to see this type
    of consistency. When the average performance is very close to the optimal performance
    and the standard deviation of performance is low, the chance of regret by selecting
    any pair of parameters is also quite low. Of course, one can avoid this pitfall
    by simply investing  in the pool of all possible combinations.  The methodology
    of this toy strategy can be vastly improved to increase risk-adjusted returns
    and robustness, but that is perhaps a subject for another post.
