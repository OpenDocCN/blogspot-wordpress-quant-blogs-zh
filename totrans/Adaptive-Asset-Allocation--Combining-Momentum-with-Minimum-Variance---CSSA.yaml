- en: 'The concept of Adaptive Asset Allocation (AAA) was presented in a whitepaper
    by Butler, Philbrick and Gordillo this summer: [Adaptive Asset Allocation](http://www.macquarieprivatewealth.ca/dafiles/Internet/mgl/ca/en/advice/specialist/darwin/documents/darwin-adaptive-asset-allocation.pdf
    "Adaptive Asset Allocation PDF"). One of the core principles of  AAA is that portfolio
    allocation should be dynamic versus strategic– in other words, an investor’s portfolio
    composition should adapt over time to respond to changes in both the expected
    return of different asset classes and also the overall risk of the portfolio.
     This theoretically ensures that investors can adequately grow and preserve their
    capital and withdraw to meet liabilities through different economic regimes (deflation,
    inflation, and many other variants).'

- en: The alluring promise of AAA rests upon the ability to dynamically adjust to
    different economic conditions. In a world where assets compete for capital, the
     best way to forecast economic conditions is to observe the relative pricing of
    the most liquid securities across markets.  The time series of major asset classes
    represent observed variables that allow investors to detect changes in the economy.
    Equity markets give us the ability to observe expected business conditions, commodities
    give us the ability to observe expected changes in inflation, while bonds give
    us the ability to observe expected changes in interest rates. Real Estate is a
    market that provides insight into all three factors, and is a direct measure of
    consumer purchasing power.  Observing world equity markets can tell us how business
    conditions are evolving globally.  These asset classes are akin to a diverse ecosystem
    where different species thrive at different times due to changes in the environment.
     If we can detect shifts in the system, we can understand in a probabilistic sense
    which species will do the best across a range of likely scenarios.  By analyzing
    the financial network of asset classes,  it is possible to express our views more
    concisely through a portfolio allocation across assets that maximizes the chance
    of being right while minimizing the cost of being wrong.

- en: The analysis of major assets classes through time series data requires integrating
    historical returns, correlations and measurements of volatility to create an efficient
    portfolio allocation. The goal of this framework is to dynamically identify the
    best performing asset classes and to manage risk at the portfolio level. The paper
    presents an example of a strategy (not the actual proprietary strategy) that effectively
    integrates these three variables into simple  and robust framework. The logic
    for this example is very straightforward yet powerful in its simplicity and is
    validated by academic research. Momentum is chosen as the method to integrate
    expected returns information since the rank of historical returns (versus the
    raw return) represents a robust method of dynamically identifying  which assets
    will perform the best in the near future (2 weeks to 3 months). It is currently
    well-accepted by even the greatest skeptics that momentum is a powerful and reliable
    anomaly.  Minimum-variance optimization (MVO) is chosen as the method to manage
    risk at the portfolio level. It is well-accepted that MVO is effective at managing
    portfolio risk because it minimizes variance as a function of both  asset cross-correlations
    and volatilities. Since MVO does not use expected returns and instead relies on
    the highly forecastable elements of volatility and correlation, it is considerably
    more robust  to estimation error than classic mean-variance optimization and performs
    better out of sample in terms of  ex-post sharpe than all other existing conventional
    portfolio algorithms. Besides the theoretical appeal of MVO, these claims have
    also been validated by numerous academic studies.

  zh: 对主要资产类别进行的时间序列数据分析需要整合历史回报、相关性和波动率的测量，以创建有效的投资组合配置。这个框架的目标是动态识别表现最佳的资产类别，并在投资组合层面管理风险。本文提供了一个策略示例（不是实际的专有策略），有效地将这三个变量整合到一个简单而健壮的框架中。这个示例的逻辑非常直观，但在其简单性方面非常强大，并且经过了学术研究的验证。动量被选择作为整合预期回报信息的方法，因为历史回报的排名（与原始回报相比）代表了一种动态识别未来表现最佳的资产的强大方法（2周到3个月）。即使是最大的怀疑者现在也普遍认为，动量是一种强大而可靠的异常。最小方差优化（MVO）被选择作为在投资组合层面管理风险的方法。广泛认为，MVO在管理投资组合风险方面是有效的，因为它将方差最小化为资产交叉相关性和波动性的函数。由于MVO不使用预期回报，而是依赖于高度可预测的波动性和相关性元素，因此它对估计误差的鲁棒性要比经典的均值-方差优化更高，并且在样本外的ex-post夏普方面表现比所有其他现有的传统投资组合算法更好。除了MVO的理论吸引力之外，这些说法也得到了许多学术研究的验证。
- en: The test presented in the paper uses a 6-month parameter (120-day) for momentum
    that selects the top 50% of asset classes and uses a weighted version of minimum-variance
    with an approximate lookback of 20 days to calculate portfolio allocations. The
    holding period for rebalancing was monthly. The obvious question is whether this
    particular combination of momentum and minimum-variance parameters were “lucky”
    and whether this represents a particular case of data snooping.  The charts below
    summarize backtests that were run from 1995 to 2012 using the assets provided
    in the whitepaper with different momentum (ROC) and minimum-variance (MINVAR)
    parameters. What is clear from the tables is that the performance in absolute
    (CAGR) and risk-adjusted terms (Gross Sharpe) is very consistent across parameters.
    While performance is more sensitive to the momentum parameters than minimum-variance,
    both are very stable. It is quite rare in system development to see this type
    of consistency. When the average performance is very close to the optimal performance
    and the standard deviation of performance is low, the chance of regret by selecting
    any pair of parameters is also quite low. Of course, one can avoid this pitfall
    by simply investing  in the pool of all possible combinations.  The methodology
    of this toy strategy can be vastly improved to increase risk-adjusted returns
    and robustness, but that is perhaps a subject for another post.

  zh: 本文所述的测试在论文中使用了一个为期 6 个月（120 天）的动量参数，选择了排名前 50% 的资产类别，并使用了一个大约为 20 天的加权最小方差版本来计算投资组合配置。重新平衡的持有期为每月一次。显而易见的问题是，这种动量和最小方差参数的特定组合是否“幸运”，以及这是否代表了特定的数据挖掘案例。下面的图表总结了从
    1995 年到 2012 年使用白皮书中提供的资产运行的不同动量（ROC）和最小方差（MINVAR）参数的回测。从表格中可以清楚地看出，无论是在绝对表现（CAGR）还是风险调整后的术语（Gross
    Sharpe）方面，性能都非常一致。虽然性能对动量参数比最小方差参数更敏感，但两者都非常稳定。在系统开发中看到这种一致性是相当罕见的。当平均性能非常接近最佳性能且性能的标准偏差很低时，选择任何一对参数的遗憾几率也相当低。当然，可以通过简单地投资于所有可能组合的池来避免这种陷阱。这种玩具策略的方法可以大大改进，以增加风险调整后的回报和鲁棒性，但这可能是另一篇文章的主题。
