    of rational expectations (RE) are things of elegance and beauty, somewhat akin
    to the pretty face you see below. This is especially their view in the light of
    two decades of research looking at learning as a foundation for macroeconomics
    -- something economists refer to as the "learning literature." You'll hear it
    said that these studies have shown that most of the RE conclusions also follow
    from much more plausible assumptions about how people form expectations and adjust
    them over time by learning and adapting. Sounds really impressive.

    models if you suppose that agents' expectations aren't formed rationally but rather
    on the basis of some learning algorithm. The paper shows that learning algorithms
    of a certain kind lead to the same equilibrium outcome as the rational expectations
    viewpoint. This IS interesting and seems very impressive. However, I'm not sure
    it's as interesting as it seems at first.

    Most of the models studied in the paper, if I understand correctly, suppose that
    agents in the market already know *the right mathematical form* they should use
    to form expectations about prices in the future. All they lack is knowledge of
    the values of some parameters in the equation. This is a little like assuming
    that people who start out trying to learn the equations for, say, electricity
    and magnetism, already know the right form of Maxwell's equations, with all the
    right space and time derivatives, though they are ignorant of the correct coefficients.
    The paper shows that, given this assumption in which the form of the expectations
    equation is already known, agents soon evolve to the correct rational expectations
    solution. In this sense, rational expectations emerges from adaptive behaviour.

    plausible, it seems to me, would be to assume that people start out with not much
    knowledge at all of how future prices will most likely be linked by inflation
    to current prices, make guesses with all kinds of crazy ideas, and learn by trial
    and error. Given the difficulty of this problem, and the lack even among economists
    themselves of great predictive success, this would seem more reasonable. However,
    it is also likely to lead to far more complexity in the economy itself, because
    a broader class of expectations will lead to a broader class of dynamics for future
    prices. In this sense, the models in this paper assume away any kind of complexity
    from a diversity of views.

    clearly. They state in fact that they assume that people in their economy form
    views on likely future prices in the same way modern econometricians do (i.e.
    using the very same mathematical models). So the gist seems to be that in a world
    in which all people think like economists and use the equations of modern econometrics
    to form their expectations, then, even if they start out with some of the coefficients
    "mis-specified," their ability to learn to use the right coefficients can drive
    the economy to a rational expectations equilibrium. Does this tell us much?
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: My view is that NO, it doesn't tell us much. It's as if the point of the learning
    literature hasn't really been to explore what might happen in macroeconomics if
    people form expectations in psychologically realistic ways, but to see how far
    one can go in relaxing the assumptions of RE while STILL getting the same conclusions.
    Of course there's nothing wrong with that as an intellectual exercise, but it
    hardly a full bore effort to understand economic reality. It's more an exercise
    in theory preservation, examining the kinds of rhetoric RE theorists might be
    able to use to defend the continued use of their favorite ideas. "Yes, if we use
    the word 'learning' in a very special way, we can say that RE theories are fully
    consistent with human learning!"

    repeating this idea that the learning literature shows that it's OK to use RE
    when in fact it does nothing of the sort. You often find this kind of argument
    when economists smack down their critics, implying that those critics "just don't

    and adjusted, I would look to the large mainstream literature on learning, to
    which Professor Syll does not refer. (Key figures in developing this literature
    included Tom Sargent, Albert Marcet, George Evans and Seppo Honkapohja: [here](http://economics.uoregon.edu/papers/UO-2005-2_Evans_Sargent_Interview.pdf)
    is a nice interview involving three of them.) Macroeconomic ideas derived from
    rational expectations models should always be re-examined within realistic learning
    environments, as in this [paper](http://pages.uoregon.edu/gevans/LTexpDyPol15september2012.pdf)
    by Benhabib, Evans and Honkapohja for example. No doubt that literature may benefit
    from additional insights that behavioural economics and others can bring. **However
    it is worth noting that a key organising device for much of the learning literature
    is the extent to which learning converges towards rational expectations.** However
    most of the time macroeconomists want to focus on something else, and so we need
    a simpler framework. In practice that seems to me to involve a binary choice.
    Either we assume that agents are very naive, and adopt something very simple like
    adaptive expectations (inflation tomorrow will be based on current and past inflation),
    or we assume rational expectations. My suspicion is that heterodox economists,
    when they do practical macroeconomics, adopt the assumption that expectations
    are naive, if they exist at all (e.g. [here](http://www.levyinstitute.org/pubs/wp_494.pdf)).
    So I want to explain why, most of the time, this is the wrong choice. My argument
    here is similar but complementary to a recent [piece](http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2013/11/05/How-Economists-Can-Tame-Irrational-Exuberance)
    by Mark Thoma on rational expectations.'

    a binary choice. After all, there is a huge range of alternatives between simple
    naive expectations and RE and this is precisely the range inhabited by real people.
    So why not look there? Why not actually look to the psychology literature on how
    people learn and use some ideas from that? Or, why not do some experiments and
    see how people form expectations in plausible economic environments, then build
    theories in that way?

    did, briefly, is to run experiments with volunteers who had to make predictions
    of inflation (and sometimes also the output gap) in a laboratory economy. The
    economy was simple: the volunteers'' expectations fed into determining the economic
    future outcomes for inflation etc. by a simple low dimensional set of equations
    known perfectly to the experimenters, but NOT known by the volunteers. So the
    dynamics of the economy here were made artificially simple, and hence easier to
    learn than they would be in a real economy; but the volunteers weren''t given
    any crutch to help them learn, such as full knowledge of the form of the equations.
    They had to, gasp, learn on their own! In a series of experiments, Assenza and
    colleagues then measured what happened in the economy -- did it settle into an
    equilibrium, did is oscillate, etc. -- and also could closely study how people
    formed expectations and whether their expectations converged to some homogeneous
    form or stayed heterogeneous. Did they eventually converge to rational expectations?
    Umm, NO.'

    expectations, their interactions and the aggregate behavior they co-create within
    a New Keynesian macroeconomic setup and we fit a heterogeneous expectations switching
    model to the experimental data. A novel feature of our experimental design is
    that realizations of aggregate variables depend on individual forecasts of two
    different variables, the output gap and inflation. We find that individuals tend
    to base their predictions on past observations, following simple forecasting heuristics,
    and individual learning takes the form of switching from one heuristic to another.
    We propose a simple model of evolutionary selection among forecasting rules based
    on past performance in order to explain individual forecasting behavior as well
    as the different aggregate outcomes observed in the laboratory experiments, namely
    convergence to some equilibrium level, persistent oscillatory behavior and oscillatory
    convergence. Our model is the first to describe aggregate behavior in a stylized
    macro economy as well as individual micro behavior of heterogeneous expectations
    about two different variables. A distinguishing feature of our heterogeneous expectations
    model is that evolutionary selection may lead to different dominating forecasting
    rules for different variables within the same economy, for example a weak trend
    following rule dominates inflation forecasting while adaptive expectations dominate
    output forecasting (see Figs. 9(c) and 9(d)).

    in this economy, including persistent oscillations in inflation and economic output
    without any equilibrium, or extended periods of recession driven by several distinct
    groups clinging to very different expectations of the future. Relaxing the assumption
    of rational expectations turns out not to be a minor thing at all. Include realistic
    learning behavior in your models, and you get a realistically complex economy

    like that observed in this experimental economy was in simulations in which agents
    formed their expectations through an evolutionary process, selecting from a set
    of heuristics and choosing whichever one happened to be working well in the recent
    past. This builds on earlier work of William Brock and Cars Hommes, the latter

    Economists are no longer stuck with their RE straitjacket, but can readily begin
