- en: I got a Ph.D. in theoretical physics, studying the transition from quantum to
    classical mechanics. I always had intended to become a professor but the idea
    became less appealing once I saw what they did all day. At this time Nick Leeson
    was making news by blowing up Barings Bank and I thought I could do that. I mean
    trade derivatives not blowing up a bank (although I could probably manage that
    as well).

    blow up a bank (尽管我也能很好地管理那件事)。

- en: The world of derivatives and trading in general is now so much more visible
    than it was and there are now far better ways to prepare. When I started, physics
    Ph.D.s were hired only because they were smart and numerate and could pick things
    up on their own. My first trading firm had no training program. You just had to
    figure stuff out on your own. Now there are many good MFE courses or you could
    do a financial economics Ph.D.

  zh: 现在，衍生品和交易的世界比过去更加透明，也有更好的准备方法。当我开始的时候，物理学的博士们之所以被雇佣，只是因为他们很聪明，擅长数字，并且能够自学。我的第一家交易公司没有培训计划。你只能自己解决问题。现在有許多很好的MFE课程，或者你可以攻读金融经济学博士学位。
- en: Further, it would very much depend on exactly what kind of physics had been
    studied. I did a lot of classical mechanics which is really geometry. This kind
    of "pure" theory isn't nearly as useful as a background heavy with stats or simulation.

- en: Trading costs. Most option trading ideas are still built on the Black-Scholes-Merton
    framework and the idea of dynamic hedging (albeit heavily modified). Most pro
    firms have stat arb like execution methods to reduce the effective bid-ask they
    pay in the underlying. They also pay practically no ticket charges and probably
    get rebates. Even then, their average profit per option trade is very small and
    has been steadily decreasing.

  zh: 交易成本。大多数期权交易想法仍然建立在布莱克-斯科尔斯-默顿框架之上，以及动态对冲（尽管已经被大大修改）。大多数专业公司采用统计对冲执行方法，以降低他们在基础资产上支付的有效买卖价差。他们还几乎不需要支付任何交易费用，可能还会获得退款。即便如此，他们每笔期权交易的平均利润非常小，并且一直在稳步下降。
- en: Further, a lot of positional option trading relies on a large universe of possible
    trades to consider. This means a trader needs good scanning software to find trades,
    and a decent risk system because she will tend to have hundreds of positions on
    at one time. This is all expensive as well.

- en: Retail traders can't play this game at all. They have to look for situations

- en: I actually think the distinction between trading and investing is fairly meaningless.
    The only difference seems to be the time scale and this is very dependent on the
    person involved as well, with long-term meaning anything form months to inter-generational.
    All I've ever done as a trader is to look for meaningful edges and I found a lot
    of these in options. But I've never found anything as persistent as the stock
    factors. There is over a hundred years of statistical evidence, studies in many
    countries and economic and behavioral reasons for their existence. They present
    some of the best edges I have ever found. That should be appealing to any trader
    or investor.

  zh: 实际上，我认为交易与投资之间的区别相当无关紧要。唯一的区别似乎是时间尺度，这也取决于涉及的人，长期意味着从几个月到跨代。我作为交易者所做的所有事情就是寻找有意义的边缘，我在期权中找到了很多这样的边缘。但我从未找到过像股票因素那样持久的。有超过一百年的统计证据，研究涉及许多国家以及经济和行为原因。它们是我找到的最好的边缘之一。这对任何交易者或投资者都应该是吸引人的。
