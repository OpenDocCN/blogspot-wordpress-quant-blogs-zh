    near certainty. CANSLIM traders will be watchful to see if the Fed can help to
    produce a Follow Through Day. The S&P 500 is already up over 7% off the lows hit
    last week. I therefore thought tonight would be a good time to post the 3rd part
    in my series on IBD Follow Through Days: Do Follow Through Days Frequently Miss
    Too Much of the Move or do They Signal Early Enough to Capture a Sizable Portion
    of the Rally?'

  zh: 由于美联储明天将召开会议，另一个波动的日子（下午2:15之后）似乎是确定的。CANSLIM交易者将密切关注美联储是否能够帮助产生一个跟随日。标普500指数已经从上周的低点上涨了超过7%。因此，我认为今晚是发布我关于IBD跟随日系列的第三部分的好时机：跟随日是否经常错过大部分行情或它们是否足够早地发出信号以捕捉行情的大部分？

    I first split all the 1% Follow Through Days into two groups – winners and losers.
    The test I used was the exact test described in part 1 using 1% Follow Through
    Days after an 8% market decline. I then measured how far from the bottom the market
    closed at on the follow through day. I am using the 1% Follow Through Day in this
    test rather than the 1.7% that IBD currently recommends due to the fact that

    Day closed, it seemed to have no affect on success or failure. For both winners
    and losers the average Follow Through Day closed about 5.2% higher than the recent
    low.

- en: I then decided to examine just the Follow Through Days that worked to see how
    much the market typically gained on a bull move between December 1971 and now.
    The average bull move over the period was about 28.8%. This includes some fantastic
    moves such as the 64% market rise from 10/1990 to 2/1994\. Of the 35 “successful”
    Follow Through Days, 25 (71%) of them saw the market gain at least another 10%
    before correcting again.

    entire remaining portion of the move. If you assume the Follow Through Day gets
    you into a move 5.2% from the bottom and you will end up or missing out on the
    top third of the move, then on average each successful Follow Through Day would
    lead to a gain of nearly 14%.

- en: Since 55% of Follow Through Days are “successful”, the expected value of buying
    the S&P 500 at the close of a follow through day with the above assumptions is
    ((0.55) * 14%) – ((0.45) * 5.6%) = 5.18%. The nicely positive expected value indicates
    the Follow Through Day is capable of catching enough of the move to make it worthwhile.

  zh: 由于有55%的跟势交易日是“成功的”，按照上述假设，在跟势交易日收盘时购买标普500的预期收益是(0.55 * 14%) – (0.45 * 5.6%)
    = 5.18%。这个正面的预期值表明，跟势交易日能够抓住足够的行情变动，使其值得一试。
- en: An important point that I neglected in calculating these numbers is that most
    traders that use Follow Through Days don’t simply trade indices. Stock selection
    and timing are important components of CANSLIM. Should their stock selection and
    timing be better than the market on average, then they could see gains many times
    greater than the expected 5.2%.

  zh: 我在计算这些数字时忽略了一个重要的点，那就是大多数使用跟势交易日的交易者并不仅仅交易指数。股票选择和时机是CANSLIM的重要组成部分。如果他们的股票选择和时机比市场平均水平要好，那么他们可能会看到比预期5.2%还要高的许多倍的收益。
- en: So in summary - here’s the good news. If this is a real bull rally there should
    be plenty of room left to make money even if a big Follow Through Day occurs soon.
    The bad news is this really isn’t an endorsement of Follow Through Days. It’s
    more an exercise in risk/reward analysis. And while the 5.2% that’s being given
    up on average around the market bottom pales in comparison to the potential gains,
    5.2% is still more than S&P returned in total in two of the last three years.
    It’s not a trivial amount. Fortunately, as I’ve demonstrated in the last few weeks,
    alternate methods can help capture a good portion of that 5.2%. Still, for traders
    without better methods of identifying market bottoms, the IBD Follow Through Day
    seems to give a decent chance of capturing a good portion of a rally.

  zh: 所以总结一下——这是好消息。如果这是一个真正的牛市反弹，即使很快就会出现一个大的跟势交易日，也还有足够的空间赚钱。坏消息是，这并不是对跟势交易日的背书。这更多的是一个风险/收益分析的练习。虽然市场上平均放弃的5.2%与潜在收益相比显得微不足道，但5.2%仍然超过了标普在过去三年中的总回报中的两年。这不是一个小数目。幸运的是，如我在过去几周所展示的，替代方法可以帮助捕捉到那5.2%的大部分。然而，对于没有更好方法识别市场底部交易者来说，IBD跟势交易日似乎提供了一个不错的机会，以捕捉反弹的大部分。
