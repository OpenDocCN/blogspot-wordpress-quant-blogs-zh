    near certainty. CANSLIM traders will be watchful to see if the Fed can help to
    produce a Follow Through Day. The S&P 500 is already up over 7% off the lows hit
    last week. I therefore thought tonight would be a good time to post the 3rd part
    in my series on IBD Follow Through Days: Do Follow Through Days Frequently Miss
    Too Much of the Move or do They Signal Early Enough to Capture a Sizable Portion
    of the Rally?'

    I first split all the 1% Follow Through Days into two groups – winners and losers.
    The test I used was the exact test described in part 1 using 1% Follow Through
    Days after an 8% market decline. I then measured how far from the bottom the market
    closed at on the follow through day. I am using the 1% Follow Through Day in this
    test rather than the 1.7% that IBD currently recommends due to the fact that

    Day closed, it seemed to have no affect on success or failure. For both winners
    and losers the average Follow Through Day closed about 5.2% higher than the recent
    low.

    much the market typically gained on a bull move between December 1971 and now.
    The average bull move over the period was about 28.8%. This includes some fantastic
    moves such as the 64% market rise from 10/1990 to 2/1994\. Of the 35 “successful”
    Follow Through Days, 25 (71%) of them saw the market gain at least another 10%
    before correcting again.

    entire remaining portion of the move. If you assume the Follow Through Day gets
    you into a move 5.2% from the bottom and you will end up or missing out on the
    top third of the move, then on average each successful Follow Through Day would
    lead to a gain of nearly 14%.

    Through Day would be about 5.6%

- en: Since 55% of Follow Through Days are “successful”, the expected value of buying
    the S&P 500 at the close of a follow through day with the above assumptions is
    ((0.55) * 14%) – ((0.45) * 5.6%) = 5.18%. The nicely positive expected value indicates
    the Follow Through Day is capable of catching enough of the move to make it worthwhile.

    traders that use Follow Through Days don’t simply trade indices. Stock selection
    and timing are important components of CANSLIM. Should their stock selection and
    timing be better than the market on average, then they could see gains many times
    greater than the expected 5.2%.

- en: So in summary - here’s the good news. If this is a real bull rally there should
    be plenty of room left to make money even if a big Follow Through Day occurs soon.
    The bad news is this really isn’t an endorsement of Follow Through Days. It’s
    more an exercise in risk/reward analysis. And while the 5.2% that’s being given
    up on average around the market bottom pales in comparison to the potential gains,
    5.2% is still more than S&P returned in total in two of the last three years.
    It’s not a trivial amount. Fortunately, as I’ve demonstrated in the last few weeks,
    alternate methods can help capture a good portion of that 5.2%. Still, for traders
    without better methods of identifying market bottoms, the IBD Follow Through Day
    seems to give a decent chance of capturing a good portion of a rally.
