    I expanded on the use of customized moving averages which are reverse engineered
    so as to neatly circumscribe past price action.

    fits prior pullbacks, as is the case with an 85 day moving average and the price
    action in the SPX since last May.

    Pitchfork](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Andrews%20Pitchfork) neatly
    captures the price action during the same period and also identifies a price channel
    and a trend line that have been critical support and resistance levels during
    the past eight months.

- en: In the chart below, you can see that the Andrews Pitchfork (named for Alan Andrews)
    is created by starting with a pivot point (I used a May 2009 cycle low) and then
    projecting a line between that pivot point and the midpoint of the next cycle
    high and low (here I used the largest pullback to date, the June-July 2009 9.1%
    selloff). That line, the middle of the three parallel blue lines, is what Andrews
    called a median line. The flanking parallel lines (“tines”) are created by projecting
    the distance between the cycle highs and lows forward in time. The result establishes
    a trend channel and median lines.

- en: Note that all three of the lines in the Andrews Pitchfork have been significant
    support or resistance levels in the past eight months. The pitchfork shows that
    through the end of October, the SPX moved in a narrow range between the median
    line and the upper tine, with the upper tine acting as channel resistance. Since
    crossing below the median line in December, the SPX hovered just below the median
    until the markets sold off last week, at which point the SPX moved sharply down
    to the lower tine. So far the lower tine has held up as support, which has served
    to reinforce the value of the pitchfork constructed off of the May-July price
    action.

    slowed and started to reverse in the past week or so. One more sharp break and
    a close below SPX 1090 is likely to signal an end to the current bullish trend
    – at least in Andrews Pitchfork terms.
