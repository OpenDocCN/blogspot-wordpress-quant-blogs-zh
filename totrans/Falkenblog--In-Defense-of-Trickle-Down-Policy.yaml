- en: I was able to go to [college in the 1930s] because . . . The state of New Jersey
    at that time offered scholarships on a competitive basis. Had a series of exams,
    and the people who succeeded in those exams and who could demonstrate financial
    need received free tuition at Rutgers . . . The tragedy is that the state of New
    Jersey in their new incarnation now has a similar program, but the qualification
    for getting a scholarship is below average academic quality . . . It typifies
    what's happened in our society. Instead of emphasizing strengthening the opportunities
    open to the able, we have tended increasingly to shift into a state of victims
    in which the emphasis is on raising the people at the bottom. Now, no social progress
    has ever come from the bottom up. It's always come from the top small number pulling
    up the society as a whole and raising it.

- en: ', which has a nice timeline of the mortgage crisis, how it started with such
    good intentions, and many little milestones. Reversing the rewards structure to
    help those at the bottom hurts incentives, and doesn''t help those at the bottom
    any more than my kid''s ''participation trophies'' help them gain self-esteem.
    It just encourages ever more intrusive policy on the theory that it merely wasn''t
    sufficient.'
