    expiration week.  Of course, not all volume is created equal.

    is double inverse ETFs, which include the [UltraShort](http://www.proshares.com/funds?products=98616&fundType=)
    ETFs pioneered by [ProShares](http://www.proshares.com/). The double inverse ETFs
    are an attractive set of investment vehicles for speculative bears to place their
    bets, because the oversized payoff if they are correct.

    the double inverse ETF for the NASDAQ-100 index (NDX).  The QID has captured the
    imagination of many retail investors who are not particularly comfortable going
    short, but have no qualms about making a bearish investment by going long an inverse
    ETF.  Volume patterns in this ETF demonstrate that the QID can be an effective
    contrarian indicator.  Take the chart below, for example, where a 5 day EMA of
    the volume has been a good indicator of tops in the NDX (the gray area chart on
    the top) when it rises above the 45-50 million share level.

    in market sentiment. I will be sharing some of my thinking in this area in the
    weeks and months ahead.
