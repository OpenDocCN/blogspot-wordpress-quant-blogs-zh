    Ratio) is a function of his selection skill (Information Coefficient) and the
    number of opportunities (N) he has.

    nodded sagely. They may have even tried to apply it in their working lives. Let's
    look at some of the underlying assumptions behind this model and understand how
    a blind application of this work may lead to suboptimal results.

- en: '**What do you mean by IC?** Most quants think they know how to measure IC,
    at least mathematically. However, the Information Coefficient for any selection
    process will vary according to time horizon. Is your IC the same for 1 day as
    for 1 month or 1 year? If you assume a flat IC for any time horizon and not incorporate
    trading cost assumptions this model will generate portfolio turnover that is uncontrollably
    high. Grinold in his later works elaborated on this turnover issue (see Grinold
    and Stuckelman, 1993; also Grinold and Kahn, 1995).'

    If you are running a 100 stock portfolio does that mean that the number of independent
    opportunities, or ideas, is 100? What if you were picking stocks based on some
    fundamental criteria (e.g. low P/E) or macro theme (e.g. rising inflationary expectations).
    Is N equal to 1, 100 or somewhere in between?'

    Supposing a gambler overheard underworld types fixing a horse race on the telephone,
    but there was noise on the line. What should the gambler bet given this knowledge
    and the level of noise (= probability of correct information) on the line? This
    discussion could then be generalized to a treatise on information content, signal-to-noise
    ratio, etc.
