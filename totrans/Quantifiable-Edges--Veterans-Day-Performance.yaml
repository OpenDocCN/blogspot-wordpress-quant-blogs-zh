- en: Veterans Day is one of the few US holidays when the bond market is closed and
    the stock market is open. Columbus Day is another. But while Columbus Day has
    exhibited some quantifiable edges, Veterans Day has not. Veterans Day is celebrated
    on November 11th (or the closest weekday to November 11th) each year. For a brief
    period from 1971 – 1977 it was celebrated on the 4th Friday of October. Below
    is a profit curve that shows how Veterans Day has performed over the years.

    the curve topped out in 1992\. Since then it has been mostly lower. Happy Veterans
    Day and thanks to all veterans!
