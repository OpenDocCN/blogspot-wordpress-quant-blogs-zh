- en: The financial markets sold off early Monday on the news of the weekend bailout
    of Cyprus, but while the risks of a financial meltdown, while real, they are overly
    exaggerated. As I write these words, US equities have recovered most of their
    losses and shrugged off the Cyprus news.

- en: To explain what happened, Cypriot banks got in over the heads with too much
    Greek debt and had to be rescued. The EU stepped in with a €10 billion rescue
    package, but with the conditionality that the government impose a 6.75% one-time
    levy on bank deposits under €100,000 and 10% for deposits over €100,000\. The
    deal has yet to be ratified by the Cypriot parliament. If it isn’t, banks in Cyprus
    are certain to collapse and there are

    happen in Cyprus, it could happen elsewhere. What if Portugal, Spain or Ireland
    had to get bailed out, would depositor funds be at risk there too? What’s to stop
    the Portuguese, Spanish and Irish from pulling their euros out of their banks
    and putting into Deutschebank in Frankfurt, thus sparking an enormous bank run
    and threatening the health of the European banking system?

    Some countries impose daily withdrawal limits, ostensibly as a measure against
    money laundering. Nor is it easy to open a bank account in a foreign country.
    In many cases, you need to have residency. You may need to travel there in person,
    and you need to speak the local language – or at least English.

    it takes” to save the eurozone. However, he has also made it clear that rescues
    come at a price. The Cypriot rescue conforms with the EU and ECB principle of
    the imposition of “conditionality” on rescues. In the case of Cyprus, the banks
    had insufficient equity to withstand the shock of a write-down of Greek debt and
    it didn’t have enough senior bond holders to cushion the pain without rendering
    the banking system insolvent. The only ones left to take the hit were the depositors.
    It didn’t hurt politically that Cyprus was known as an offshore banking haven,
    mainly for Russian oligarchs. So it was easy for Angela Merkel to sell a bailout
    involving shared pain to the German people.

    will conform to a different template of conditionality other than the imposition
    of a tax on bank deposits. For example, the ECB has made it clear that it will
    backstop Spain, but on condition that the government undertake structural reforms
    and austerity. In the case of Spain, Rajoy has yet to swallow the bitter pill
    that comes with an OMT bailout.

    the Cypriot parliament will approve the rescue package and approval isn’t fully
    assured. If the deal were not to be ratified, it would likely introduce a new
    element of risk to the eurozone banking system and possible contagion into the
    global banking system. In that case, all bets are all.

    diverging from Germany and France needs to take steps to align itself with Germany
    and the core eurozone economies. While the EU can rescue Greek and Cyprus, France
    is at the heart of the EU and much too big to save.
