    the markets should be asking themselves how the current subprime mortgage mess
    compares with the [Long-Term Capital Management](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-Term_Capital_Management)
    failure of nine years ago.

    The Rise and Fall of Long-Term Capital Management](http://www.amazon.com/When-Genius-Failed-Long-Term-Management/dp/0375758259),
    it isn’t too late to do so.  Among the events that Lowenstein recounts is the
    merciless squeezing of LTCM’s positions by Goldman, Salomon and others, activities
    that may have strong parallels to some of what is going on behind the scenes right
    now.'

    triggered by the failure of LTCM to what we have seen in the last two months.  Keep
    in mind that according to Lowenstein, LTCM’s capital peaked in April 1998, as
    shown in the graphic below from [Siddharth Prabhu](http://www.econ.duke.edu/dje/2001/prabhu.pdf),
    who utilizes Lowenstein’s data.

- en: As the graph of VIX and SPX from 1998 toward the bottom demonstrates, LTCM’s
    small losses from April to July have very little impact on the markets, but as
    the losses grow (and the [Russian financial crisis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_financial_crisis)
    widens), the VIX nearly triples over the course of two months, while the S&P 500
    loses approximately 20%.  For more historical context, note that by the end of
    the year the SPX had recovered all of those losses and moved higher, while the
    VIX returned almost to the pre-crisis lows.

- en: How does the current situation stack up?  Looking at the chart at the bottom,
    once again, the VIX has almost tripled in two months (doubled in one month), while
    the SPX has lost closer to 10% of its value.  For comparative purposes, this means
    more fear in the current situation, with less in the way of financial losses –
    at least at this stage.

    in the books, you would think that those who are in a position to avert another
    similar crisis would be in a better position to do so.  Keep an eye on the comparisons
    to 1998 going forward and don’t be so quick to conclude that this time it will
    be worse than it was nine years ago.
