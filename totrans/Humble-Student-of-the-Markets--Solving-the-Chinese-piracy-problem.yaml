- en: There has been a lot of hand wringing over the years about the problem of counterfeiting
    and copyright piracy in China. The Chinese, it is said, have no respect for intellectual
    property and will copy anything. Many have advocated tough solutions to deal with
    the piracy problem.

  zh: 赵宏伟在2010年写了这些话：
- en: Back when I was a private equity professional investing in China, I’d say that
    9 out of every 10 opportunities I saw involved what I would call “commodity” manufacturers
    — factories that churned out a standardized, low value-add product that virtually
    anyone could make, and competed solely on price. Even though they accounted for
    a big chunk of China’s productive capacity, and often were making good money,
    we did everything we could to avoid such investments. We figured that, whether
    in one year or ten, these companies would inevitably lose their purely cost-based
    competitive advantage as China’s economy developed. They represented China’s past,
    not its future.

  zh: 当我是一名在中国进行私募股权投资的专业人士时，我会说我所看到的每一个机会中有9个涉及到我所说的“商品”制造商——工厂生产标准化、低增值的产品，几乎任何人都能制造，仅仅依靠价格竞争。尽管它们占据了我国生产能力的一大块，并且通常能赚取丰厚的利润，但我们尽一切可能避免这类投资。我们认为，无论是一年还是十年，随着中国经济的发展，这些公司迟早会失去它们基于成本的竞争优势。它们代表了中国过去，而不是未来。

  zh: 换句话说，中国公司被商品化的制造商，竞争的是它们的低成本生产商地位。新一代的公司正在向价值链上游移动：
- en: 'At least one out of every ten Chinese companies we looked at, though, had more
    promise. Either they were making something unique, or they were doing something
    markedly better than their competitors: achieving higher quality, reaching more
    markets, building a brand name, etc. Often their costs were higher. Among other
    things, they had to hire better, more expensive employees, not just in production,
    but in sales, marketing, and customer service. They had to invest in training
    and sometimes even in partnerships with local schools to ensure a steady stream
    of qualified workers as they expanded. Like any investment, it was a risk, but
    it had the potential to pay off by setting them apart from the low-cost, low value-add
    pack. These are the companies we were betting would own the future.'

  zh: 然而，我们研究的每十家中国公司中至少有一家更有前途。要么他们制造的东西独一无二，要么他们做的事情比竞争对手做得好得多：质量更高，市场更广，品牌知名度更高等等。通常他们的成本更高。在生产之外，他们不得不雇佣更好、更昂贵的员工，不仅在销售、营销和客户服务方面。他们必须投资于培训，有时甚至与当地学校建立合作伙伴关系，以确保在扩张过程中有合格工人的稳定流动。像任何投资一样，都有风险，但它有可能通过使它们脱离低成本、低增值的群体而获得回报。这些是我们押注将拥有未来的公司。

    sneer, you can’t flaunt it...

  zh: 造假者不再受欢迎。不久前，中国消费者还为造假者节省他们的钱而鼓掌。现在他们鄙视他们。如果这是假的，富有的阶层会嘲笑，你不能炫耀它...
- en: Still, as China grows richer, life is growing harder for fakers. A recent study
    of China’s luxury market by Bain, a consultancy, concludes that “demand for counterfeit
    products is decreasing fast.” McKinsey, another consultancy, found that the proportion
    of consumers who said they were willing to buy fake jewellery dropped from 31%
    in 2008 to 12% last year. This is good news for all brands, not just the blingy
    ones. “Consumers are looking for the real thing, and they are increasingly willing
    and able to afford it,” say the authors.

  zh: 尽管如此，随着中国变得更加富裕，假冒伪劣商品的生活变得更加艰难。 咨询公司贝恩最近对中国奢侈品市场的一项研究得出结论：“对假冒产品的需求正在迅速减少。”
    另一家咨询公司麦肯锡发现，自2008年以来，表示愿意购买假珠宝的消费者比例从31%下降到去年的12%。 这对所有品牌都是好消息，而不仅仅是那些闪亮的品牌。“消费者正在寻找真实的东西，并且他们越来越愿意并且有能力负担得起，”作者说道。

  zh: 这是因为中国人已经向价值链上游迁移：
- en: Another reason why fakers are under pressure is that Chinese firms now have
    intellectual property of their own to protect. Brands such as Lenovo (a computer
    firm) and Haier (a maker of everything from fridges to air-conditioners) are highly
    valuable and therefore worth defending. The more Chinese innovators gripe about
    fakery, the more strictly the government enforces the law. It just announced that
    it aims to stamp out counterfeit software in government offices by the end of
    this year.

  zh: 另一个压力加大的原因是中国企业现在有了自己的知识产权需要保护。 联想（一家计算机公司）和海尔（从冰箱到空调等各种产品的制造商）等品牌价值极高，因此值得保护。
    中国创新者越是抱怨仿冒行为，政府就越是严格执行法律。 它刚刚宣布，到今年年底，将旨在在政府办公室消灭盗版软件。
- en: The Chinese are on a well trodden path followed by other Asian economies that
    have migrated up the value chain, such as Japan (those of us old enough still
    remember the ridicule of the cheap Japanese imports from the 1960's), South Korea,
    Taiwan, etc. The latest five year plan calls for more balanced growth and high
    value-added exports. While the jury is out on the first objective, they seem to
    be fulfilling at least on the second part.

    最新的五年计划呼吁实现更加平衡的增长和高附加值出口。 尽管对第一个目标的评判尚未定论，但至少在第二个目标上似乎是在实现。
