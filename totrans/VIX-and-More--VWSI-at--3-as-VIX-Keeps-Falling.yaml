- en: The VIX fell 3.26 (12.7%) to end the week at 22.45, the lowest end of the week
    close for 2008 so far. Last week's move brings the drop in the VIX to 8.71 points
    or 28% over the past three weeks and brings the index to a level about 8.9% the
    10 day SMA and 15.3% below the 20 day SMA.

    has only ticked up from +1 to +3 in the past week (but up from -4 three weeks
    ago), suggesting a most likely scenario of only a mild increase in volatility
    over the next week or two.

- en: With all the recent attention being given to the VIX and the [200 day SMA](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/200%20day%20SMA)
    (currently at 22.90), I thought I should weigh in by expanding upon some comments
    I have made previously. Specifically, it is my opinion that technical analysis
    does not work well with a derivative in which one cannot trade the underlying.
    Part of my thinking is that there is no such thing as support for the VIX at the
    200d SMA (or any moving average) because one cannot trade the VIX directly when
    it hits a support (or resistance) point. In a more general sense, many TA techniques
    are on shaky ground with derivatives in which the underlying is not traded, so
    I am skeptical about the value of technical analysis of the VIX.

- en: That being said, if enough people use the VIX as a market timing tool, some
    of the market's response to important TA VIX signals can filter down to the VIX
    itself and have somewhat of a reinforcing effect. I suspect that the effect, if
    any, is quite small.

- en: Those who want to eyeball the significance of the 200d SMA are encouraged to
    look at a chart of the VIX with the 200d SMA going back 5 years or more. The only
    time that the 200d SMA appears to have served as even minor support or resistance
    was in July 2006 -- and that looks more like a small coincidence on the long-term
    chart than solid technical support. For the most part, the 200d SMA has been irrelevant
    throughout the history of the VIX -- and there is no reason to think that fact
    should change in the present environment.
