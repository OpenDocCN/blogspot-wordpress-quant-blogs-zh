    last traded over 1200\. From that point, it only took six more trading days before
    the SPX closed under 1000\. From that point forward, the SPX flirted with the
    1000 level for about a month, before plunging to a low close of 752 in November
    and ultimately a bottom closing low of 676 in March.

    [200 day simple moving average](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/200%20day%20SMA)
    for the SPX is in the process of dropping those last few closing values in the
    1000-1200 range over the course of the next week or so. This means, among other
    things, that the 200 day moving average is going to start forming a rounded bottom
    next week and should only drop another five points or so to 869\.

    beginning of September. At that point, it should start rising at a rate of about
    two points per week.

    (about 6.6%) since July 2007\.
