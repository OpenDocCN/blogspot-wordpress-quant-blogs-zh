    Case in point, calling a scrum [daily](http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/daily-scrum/)
    meeting a scrum when its not actually a scrum is just silly – if its a status
    or team meeting, call it that.

    on the big data that appropriately references SynerScope, with an appropriate
    screen shot off the web site showing the User Experience offered to help identify
    patterns from data.  Its unfortunate that the [case](http://www.synerscope.com/case-studies/)
    studies on SynerScope’s web site cover the usual suspects. What would be more
    interesting is if anyone is using SynerScope to look at all clients trading activity
    to identify trends 🙂  Further, given the [FlashBoys](http://www.amazon.com/Flash-Boys-Wall-Street-Revolt/dp/0393244660),
    one can only image SynerScope would in interesting from a HFT perspective 😉
