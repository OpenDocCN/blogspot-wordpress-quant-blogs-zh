    It took a few years, but it's finally happened. As China's economic outlook and

- en: To be sure, the news out of China is grim. A series of "common prosperity" crackdowns,
    financial restructuring, and a slowing economy have combined to tank Asia's stock
    markets. The relative performance of the markets of China and her major Asian
    trading partners against the MSCI All-Country World Index (ACWI) has been weak.
    With the exception of Taiwan, all have broken key relative support levels indicating
    relative underperformance against global equities.
