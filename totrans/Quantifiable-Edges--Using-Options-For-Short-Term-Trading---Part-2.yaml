    Today I will expand on that with some rules I follow and other thoughts. If you
    didn’t catch last week’s post,

    in for a number of days, rather than weeks or months, I frequently trade deep
    in the money options rather than the stock or ETF. The reasons and a general methodology
    were outlined last week. Below are some more specifics for you to consider along
    with answers to a few questions I received:'

- en: I especially like stocks in the $40-$80 range. – The spread on many deep options
    is $0.10\. Sometimes you’ll find something appropriate with a $0.05 spread, but
    not always. In many cases you can assume you will lose at least most of the spread
    on the trade. If I’m looking for a 2-3% move I don’t want to give away $0.10-$0.15
    on a $15 stock. Doing that may destroy my edge. With low priced stocks I normally
    just buy the stock.

    More than $0.15 or $0.20 and I begin to lose some interest. In low-volatility
    environments this is easily accomplished. During panic situations when the VIX
    spikes you’ll be hard pressed to find anything trading without a decent amount
    of premium.

- en: – The contracts are generally monthly. My trades average about 1 week. Two weeks
    to expiration is the sweet spot. Less than one week and I’m normally looking out
    to the next month (which means additional premium). Three weeks or longer and
    your going to have to pay for some time value. If the trade works quickly then
    you may be able to sell the option with time value left in it. There will be some
    erosion, though.

    Basically, I want the price to move up very close to the same amount as the stock
    price.

    normally not trading a size larger than I would trade if I owned the stock anyway.
    Therefore, taking delivery of the stock is an option. If it is index shares that
    I’m leveraged with, then I need to roll them out to the next month.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Rolling out to the next month adds some cost. First, you have basic transaction
    costs since you are selling your options and buying others. Frequently more significant
    is the premium cost. You are selling an option with 0 premium and buying one with
    some premium. To help reduce the amount of premium the roll will cost you, a spread
    trade normally helps. Rather than entering a sell for X contracts and then a buy
    for X contracts, put it in as a spread trade. Even though the option may trade
    with a $0.10 spread, you can enter spread trades to the penny.

    position you could consider moving to a lower strike price (assuming long call).
    Two things will happen when your stock price rapidly approaches your strike price.
    1) Premium may get built into the option since you are now near or at the money
    rather than deep into it. 2) The increase in premium will also mean a decrease
    in delta. So when the stock does bounce your option initially may go up $0.75
    for every dollar rather than the $0.95 for every dollar that it would have when
    you bought it.

- en: 'Therefore, one strategy to consider would be to sell the now “near the money”
    option you hold and buy a deep one. This accomplishes two things: 1) You are able
    to make money on the premium that was just built up and 2) You own an option with
    a higher delta that will rise faster than your original option.'

- en: Of course there is a big disadvantage to doing this, and that is that you are
    now laying out more capital. Part of the reason for using options is to control
    risk. Swapping out for deeper ones when the trade goes against you increases your
    initial risk, so it’s something that needs to be carefully thought through before
    doing it.

    include: 1) They can be traded in the same account as stocks. No need to segregate
    to a futures account. 2) In low volatility environments, you can actually get
    more leveraged than with futures.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A big disadvantage rears its head in high volatility environments. When the
    market sells off hard and volatility spikes, even fairly deep index options carry
    a decent amount of premium. With futures this is not as much of an issue.
