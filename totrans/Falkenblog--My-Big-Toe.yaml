    unconscious things like plants and rocks, and these effects need to be incorporated
    into the environment.  Things that don’t affect a consciousness still have real
    effects that we see later, and if the world is simulated precisely because it’s
    too complicated to calculate the emergent property ex ante, then one needs to
    run the simulation for these effects all the time anyway, not just when a conscious
    agent looks.  Consciousness seems like an arbitrary way to dictate the nature
    of what actually happens in a simulation, as if the simulators are monitoring
    conscious agents and their peripherals, which seems implausible.

    they wouldn''t be playing games, they’d be trying to figure out how to kill themselves

     Avatars in a sim might consider their programmers gods.  In both cases, these
    gods are not omnipotent nor omniscient, exactly why they appreciate their creations.
    Even if god were as in the Bible, I can't imagine he's truly omnipotent because
    in such cases he would have no reason to create the Earth or people, because he
    would know what would happen--he could figure everything out-- making the exercise
    uninteresting, uninformative, pointless.

    things interact over time that keeping track of all those point objects would
    require a great deal of information, indeed,  the information needed if we didn't
    have wave-particle duality would overtax our simulators.  Luckily, the interaction
    of wave functions for these particles greatly compresses the amount of information
    needed to

    these particles, it completely captures their interaction.  The set of all possible
    wave functions at any given time forms a vector space, which means that it is
    possible to add different waves like how you can combine Gaussian distributions
    into a single Gaussian distribution and ignore all the ones that came before.
     When there are many particles there is only one wave function, not a separate
    wave function for each particle.

    an aspect of their simulation, our reality. For example, as we move forward it
    time, having electrons exist as a constant probability mass as opposed to moving
    about is both consistent with all its potential interactions and uses a lot less
    memory.

    are watching or not, the compression is built into nature as a way to save on
    electricity, as opposed to caring about whether clever scientists are watching

    another reason to suspect we are in a simulation. If we are in a simulation, it's
    interesting to think why this is amusing or informative to a really smart being.
