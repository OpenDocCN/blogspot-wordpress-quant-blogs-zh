# Humble Student of the Markets: The more things change...

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2020/10/the-more-things-change.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2020/10/the-more-things-change.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models**

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post,

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The

**Trend Asset Allocation Model**

is an asset allocation model which applies trend following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or contraction (bearish)?"

My inner trader uses a

**trading model**

, which is a blend of price momentum (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa). Subscribers receive real-time alerts of model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of the those email alerts are updated weekly

. The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that began in March 2016 is shown below.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Sell equities*
*   Trend Model signal: Bearish*
*   Trading model: Bearish*

**Plus ça change...**

The market was subjected to an unexpected shock late Thursday when President Trump announced that he had been diagnosed with a COVID-19 infection. What was unusual was the behavior of many market internals - they stayed the same.

*Plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose*. The more things change, the more they stay the same.

In light of this development, Trump is forced to quarantine and his campaign activities are suspended or curtailed. This creates a headwind for his electoral chances about a month ahead of the election. The betting odds on a Trump victory fell in the betting markets, but the overall Republican odds of a victory was steady as the odds on the Pence contract rose.  *Plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose*. 

Equally puzzling was the behavior of risk. Prior to the news, the option market was discounting heightened odds of a disputed election. Average option implied volatility (IV) spiked just ahead of the November 3 election, and they remained elevated until mid-December. The shape of the implied volatility curve stayed the same after the news. *Plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose*.

The technical behavior of the market was also relatively steady. Both the S&P 500 and NASDAQ 100 rallied last week and regained their respective 50 day moving average (dma) levels. Both indices remained range-bound for the week, bounded by a band of upside resistance and downside support.
