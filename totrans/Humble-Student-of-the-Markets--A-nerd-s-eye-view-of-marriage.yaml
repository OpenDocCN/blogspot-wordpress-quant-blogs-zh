    as a solitary occupant of the same property. But both of you probably enjoy the
    benefits of more than half a house. If a couple owns one car, similarly, both
    have more than half a car. Even food is semi-rival, as the classic "You gonna
    eat that?" question proves.

    apartment and 12% for a three-bedroom apartment, according to real-estate website
    Trulia, which analyzed its nationwide rental listings. Jed Kolko, chief economist
    at Trulia, compared apartments in the same building—instead of the median rents
    for apartments in the same or even a nearby neighborhood—to make sure the comparisons
    were apples to apples. (By moving into a one-bedroom apartment, they obviously
    save 50% of the monthly rent.) “It might not be the romantic discussion you expected,”
    Kolko says, “but these savings could make the proposal a little more compelling.”

    analytical approach could be used to model the behavior of roommates. What is
    different is that roommates are generally not committed to staying together for
    an indefinite period of time.

    capital expenditures, such as a washing machine, under some sort of formal financial
    arrangement (I buy it, you pay me your half when you leave), but what roommates
    would agree to buy a long-lived asset like a house and correspondingly assume
    a long-lived liability like a mortgage together (not to mention other commitments
    with long time horizons like bringing up children)?

    I have been married to Mrs. Humble Student of the Markets for nearly two decades
    and we have known each other for about three decades. I can attest to that I consider
    myself fortunate to have been with her for all this time and derived  a great
    deal of benefit during this period.
