    not all about the financial system. It's not about GM or Chrysler. Go back to
    the writings of Michael Porter and consider what are America’s competitive advantages?

    by invading a populous emerging market country and then forcing everyone at gunpoint
    to buy American cars. There is one problem, though. As demonstrated by the Iraqi

    benefit of soaking up pockets of U.S. unemployment.
