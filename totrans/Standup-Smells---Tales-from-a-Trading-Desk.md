## Standup Smells

Badly run [standup’s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_meeting) are painful to watch, and even more painful to participate in.  [Gordon](http://techportal.inviqa.com/2012/04/02/agile-smells/) [amongst](http://agilepainrelief.com/notesfromatooluser/2010/04/pathologies-of-the-daily-scrum-or-standup.html) [others](http://scrumcrazy.wordpress.com/2010/09/18/bad-smells-of-the-daily-scrum/), offers a few [bad](http://www.tech-zone.org/memorias/2012/alba_lopez_2012_doc.pdf) standup smells.

Unfortunately, its often the case that not everyone in the team is aware of the reason and benefit of a standup;  Standup’s are run with the aim of the team collectively being aware of what each team member is doing, and how they are progressing towards the goal – being DONE on all stories for the sprint.

Memory problem/ramble/turn up-talk-loose-interest show a lack of respect for the team, and a lack of commitment to the sprint.

Here are a few additional bad smells:

*   No Wall – Standup’s without a wall of sprint cards are the first bad smell in my view.
*   Late – Where people don’t turn up on time for the standup – lack of commitment, and respect to other team members.
*   What Story? – Speaker fails to recall what story they are working on, but does recall what area of the code they are working in.  Classic sign of code scope-creep.  The smell in itself will often lead to a failed sprint.
*   Where’s the burndown? – During a scrum I would expect the team to be clear on where they are for the overall sprint.
