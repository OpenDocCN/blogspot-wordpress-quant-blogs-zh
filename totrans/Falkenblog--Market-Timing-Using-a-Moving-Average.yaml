    the index was above its 10 month moving average, went to T-bills otherwise, where
    'the market' is the value-weighted US composite. The arithmetic return was slightly
    higher simply always being long (10.7% vs. 10.0%), but given the volatility of
    the long-only rule was 50% higher, its geometric return was about the same (9.3%
    vs. 9.2%). The Sharpe ratio using this index data suggests the market timing rule
    significantly helps one's investment, taking it from 0.30 to 0.46 in this 1926-2008
    period.

    a 6-month moving average, or an 18-month moving average.

    markets: 29-33, 73-75, 2000-02, and 2007-08\. Perhaps in a simple moving average
    rule is a wise investment strategy. I would want to look at international data
    to become more certain, but it''s interesting.'
