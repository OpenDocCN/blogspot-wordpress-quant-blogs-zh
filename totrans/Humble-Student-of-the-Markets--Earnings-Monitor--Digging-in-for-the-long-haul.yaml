    With 90% of the index having reported, this will be the final earnings monitor

    forward 12-month estimate fell -0.64% last week (vs. -1.4% the previous week),
    and -20.0% since downgrades began nine weeks ago. The EPS and sales beat rates
    were both below their 5-year historical averages.
