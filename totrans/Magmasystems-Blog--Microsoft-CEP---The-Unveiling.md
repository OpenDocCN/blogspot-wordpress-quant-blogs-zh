# Magmasystems Blog: Microsoft CEP - The Unveiling

> 来源：[http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2009/05/microsoft-cep-unveiling.html#0001-01-01](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2009/05/microsoft-cep-unveiling.html#0001-01-01)

This announcement is from the Microsoft TechEd site. If you attend this talk, please let me know your impressions. I have been under NDA about this for several months, so I have not blogged at all about the new Microsoft CEP product.

(I guess that the CEP team dropped the code-name and is calling this the All Data Platform ?)

DAT309 Low-Latency Data and Event Processing with Microsoft SQL Server

Presenter: Torsten Grabs

Tue 5/12 | 4:30 PM-5:45 PM | Room 151

While typical relational database applications are query-driven, event-driven applications have become increasingly important. Event-driven applications are characterized by high event data rates, standing queries, and millisecond latency requirements that make it impractical to persist the data in a database before it is processed. These requirements are shared by various scenarios across verticals such as manufacturing, oil and gas, power utilities, financial services as well as IT and data center monitoring. In this session we explore technology from the Microsoft SQL Server flight of products that covers these scenarios and addresses those requirements. The session discusses use cases in depth and explains how key components of the Microsoft All Data Platform can be used to build domain-specific solutions. As part of the session, we also go over various deployment alternatives and key dates of the product roadmap.
