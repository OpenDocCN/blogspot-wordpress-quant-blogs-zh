    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    in the direction of the main Trend Model signal. A bullish Trend Model signal
    that gets less bullish is a trading "sell" signal. Conversely, a bearish Trend
    Model signal that gets less bearish is a trading "buy" signal. The history of
    actual out-of-sample (not backtested) signals of the trading model are shown by
    the arrows in the chart below. The turnover rate of the trading model is high,
    and it has varied between 150% to 200% per month.

    for the next 12 months remains neutral, at the current pace of deterioration,
    they would become sufficiently negative to flash a recession warning later this
    year. This would indicate that a recession would occur in Q4 2019\. As stock prices
    tend to be forward looking, the combination of bearish technical readings and
    weakness in long leading indicators suggest that a market top is forming about
    now.
