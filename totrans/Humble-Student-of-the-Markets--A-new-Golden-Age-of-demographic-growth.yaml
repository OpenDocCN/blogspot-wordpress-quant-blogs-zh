    They found that P/E ratios were correlated to the ratio of middle-aged people
    to young adults, otherwise known as the MY ratio. When MY rises, the market P/E
    will tend to rise and when it falls, P/Es tend to fall.

    fall in P/E ratios with a long-term bottom in stock prices forming about 2018,
    or eight years from now.

    are very favorable to apartment renting. And so of course these days, the multi-family
    housing sector has been leading the way. And you hear all these stories about
    how people aren't into homeownership anymore. But the demographics that are currently
    favorable to apartments will turn into demographics favorable to homeownership,
    as the cohort gets older, moves into higher paying jobs, and wants more space
    for those new babies.

    will drive a bull market in housing, as well as the stock market. It`s nice to
    get confirmation of my demographically driven analysis from an well-respected
    source.
