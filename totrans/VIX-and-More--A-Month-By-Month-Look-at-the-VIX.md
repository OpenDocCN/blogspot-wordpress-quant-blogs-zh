I’ll cut to the chase and put the graph of the monthly closes (with all values normalized to a monthly mean of 100) in the VIX first:

*   We are currently in the middle of the November-March doldrums
*   March-June and June-September are the two monthly volatility trends to keep an eye on
*   From a “sell in May and go away” perspective, the May-August period has included the VIX high month only twice, but the low VIX month ten out of seventeen years
