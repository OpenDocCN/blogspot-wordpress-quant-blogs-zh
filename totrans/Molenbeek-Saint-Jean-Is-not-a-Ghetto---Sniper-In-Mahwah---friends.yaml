    the nature of exchanges and high-frequency trading. But for once I publish here
    today a quite personal take on Molenbeek-Saint-Jean, the now infamous city of
    Brussels where a lot of the Paris terrorists came from. Some of them were my direct
    neighbors. As an anthropologist, even if I didn’t work on my own city, I have
    been living in one of this Molenbeek* *neighborhood* *for seven years, and I have
    observed how the* *place* *have changed. I think intellectuals have a main duty
    –  inform people. Given what was written about Molenbeek the last ten days, I
    could not stay quiet. This post is not an attempt to understand the incomprehensible;
    this is just my point of view on Molenbeek-Saint-Jean. This op-ed was published
    in French by [Le Monde](http://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2015/11/23/molenbeek-saint-jean-n-est-pas-un-ghetto_4815791_3232.html) and
    I put on this blog a corrected [version](https://sniperinmahwah.wordpress.com/2015/11/24/molenbeek-saint-jean-nest-pas-un-ghetto/)*;
    *both versions were visited by more than 5,000 readers each. I thank you a lot
    all the readers who wrote me “Thank you for this text”. That’s the proofs words
    and long-read are helpful. Also, I thank you a lot my friend and translator Jean-François
    Caro who quickly translated my text in English – Jef, I owe you more than a couple
    of Belgian beers for that! If some misprints remain, they are all mines. Comments
    are possible, even if I don’t have the energy anymore to engage in a debate. Now
    it’s time to rest a little, after the last ten days of darkness.]*'

- en: We should first provide some context. Contrary to what several media outlets
    asserted, Molenbeek is not a “suburb.” “Brussels” refers to one of the three Belgian
    Regions; it is composed of 19 *communes* or boroughs, among which “Brussels City”
    and Molenbeek. Even though an undeniable physical, social and symbolic boundary
    is traced by a canal running between the two boroughs, the center of “Brussels
    City” is only a 15-minute walk – or three subway stops – away from where I live.
    It therefore seems that “suburb” is shamefully employed to evoke those Île-de-France
    cities remote from the center of Paris where a Muslim community increasingly plagued
    by poverty – and thus by radicalism – allegedly resides. Molenbeek is not a suburb,
    and, just like the entire Brussels region, it is composed of highly disparate
    micro-neighborhoods. There are several Molenbeeks, and it is essential to take
    this disparity into account.

  zh: 我们首先应该提供一些背景。与一些媒体机构的说法相反，多尔贝克不是一个“郊区”。“布鲁塞尔”指的是比利时三个地区之一；它由19个市镇或区组成，其中包括“布鲁塞尔市”和多尔贝克。尽管一条运河在两个区之间划定了明显的物理、社会和象征界限，但“布鲁塞尔市”的中心只离我住处15分钟步行路程——或者三个地铁站点。因此，“郊区”这个词似乎被羞愧地用来唤起那些远离巴黎中心的法兰西岛城市，那里有一个日益贫困——因此也日益激进——的穆斯林社区。多尔贝克不是一个郊区，而且，与整个布鲁塞尔地区一样，它由高度不同的微型社区组成。有几个多尔贝克，因此务必考虑这种差异。
- en: 'What does one of these now internationally scrutinized Molenbeek neighborhoods
    look like? The answer is simple: most streets are lined with typical Brussels
    brick-houses, with the exception of a few “council estate”-styled buildings that
    blend into the surroundings. Without going back on the long and fascinating history
    of the borough (which sheltered exiled Parisian Communards in the 1870s, at a
    time when its flourishing industry earned it the nickname of “Little Manchester”),
    Molenbeek includes today several micro-neighborhoods composed for 80% of Belgian
    inhabitants belonging to a Muslim community that has major ties with Morocco,
    and among which a particularly high number of (sometimes very young) men or women
    have embraced the Jihadi cause in Syria. That said, the few statistic figures
    available show that while one half of the Belgians who left for Syria come from
    the Brussels region, the other half comes from Flanders, especially Vilvoorde
    and Antwerp – where in the latter city the Sharia4Belgium Salafist proselytes
    were identified as the main recruiters of Belgian jihadists by the Belgian authorities.
    The issue of Islamism extends beyond the limits of Molenbeek. The press has qualified
    the borough – or at least a number of its (micro-)neighborhoods – as a “ghetto.”
    In spite of my doubts regarding the true meaning of the term (unless, following
    Max Weber, we define it as an “excluding closure”), the wealthy borough of Uccle,
    brimming with French tax exiles, is to me far more “ghetto-ized” than my own borough,
    a place characterized by its diversity, where more than 100 nationalities live
    without the slightest inter-community tension.'

  zh: 这些如今受到国际关注的多尔贝克街区之一是什么样子呢？答案很简单：大多数街道两旁都是典型的布鲁塞尔砖房，有几栋“公屋”风格的建筑融入了周围环境。不必回顾这个区漫长而迷人的历史（该区在19世纪70年代庇护了流亡的巴黎公社成员，当时其繁荣的工业使它获得了“小曼彻斯特”的昵称），多尔贝克今天包括几个由80%的比利时居民组成的微型社区，他们属于一个与摩洛哥有重大联系的穆斯林社区，其中许多（有时非常年轻的）男性和女性在叙利亚接受了圣战事业。话说回来，现有的少数统计数据显示，尽管前往叙利亚的比利时人一半来自布鲁塞尔地区，另一半来自弗拉芒区，尤其是维尔沃德和安特卫普——在后者的城市，比利时当局认为“沙里亚4比利时”的萨拉菲斯特传教士是招募比利时圣战者的主要人物。伊斯兰主义问题超出了多尔贝克的界限。媒体将这个区——或者至少是其中的一些（微型）社区——称为“贫民窟”。尽管我对这个词语真正含义表示怀疑（除非，像马克斯·韦伯那样，我们将其定义为“排外的封闭”），但我认为，充满法国避税者的乌克勒区比我自己的区更“贫民窟化”，我所在的区以其多样性著称，在那里超过100个国籍的人居住在一起，没有一丝社区间的紧张气氛。

    who left his parents shaken with incomprehension. He was taken to Syria by his
    older brother, Adbelhamid Abaaoud, one of the main alleged backers of the recent
    Paris attacks, who died in Saint-Denis. Younès went to school at several hundred
    yards from where I live, and I have often thought that I may have crossed his
    path at some point. Maybe he was that kid who looked up from his portable PlayStation
    and smiled at me as he walked in my street, ten feet behind his mother covered
    in black from head to toes, hands included, herself walking ten feet behind a

    who were only wearing a simple headscarf a couple of years ago now wear the hijab.
    Nowadays, it is not unusual to see 5-year old girls walking in the street wearing
    a beautiful, coloured hijab –while this was far less frequent, and even nonexistent,
    a couple of years ago. Despite being banned from the public space, the niqab is
    quite visible in front of the closest school from where I live. In the old local
    post office, it is not unusual to hear religious chants playing on cell phones
    (I once asked a woman to mute the sound, arguing that she shouldn’t impose me
    prayers from a religion that was not mine; she immediately complied, but I could
    tell by the look in her eyes that she felt it was an odd demand). It is not unusual,
    either, to find flyers stacked on bakery counters advertising one Muslim event
    or the other, adorned with the faces of foreign preachers who, it turns out after
    a brief Internet search, appear in videos where they call for “burning the Jews.”
    Let’s not forget the sinister-looking bearded proselytes who move in groups of
    three, going from door to door or lecturing young people hanging out in the street.
    In early 2015, a war photographer and anthropologist decided to leave Molenbeek,
    explaining his decision as follows: “[Here] everything has gone grey, everything
    reeks of pessimism. The radicalism and the gloom that have taken hold of my neighborhood
    have thrown me in a depression. I find it terrible that certain people have tried
    to convert me to Islam in the street.” While no-one has ever tried to convert
    me, I sadly share the same conclusions regarding this greyness and pessimism (even
    though greyness has more to do with Brussels – if not Belgium – than with Molenbeek
    itself: after all, Brussels is not Marseille). Perhaps what the photographer called
    “greyness” also referred to the filth that litters certain streets that have become
    genuine open-air garbage dumps with smashed sidewalks where the trash sometimes
    lies for weeks before the borough collection service ends up cleaning it (which
    at times lead to infinitely sad scenes, such as when Romani come to pick up the
    what little reusable waste is left by their neighbors, followed by Eastern-European
    immigrants looking for metal – there are the poor, the poorer, then the even poorer).'

    certain people have tried to convert me to Islam in the street.” 虽然没有人曾试图在街上向我传教，但我悲哀地得出了与这种灰暗和悲观相同的结论（尽管这种灰暗与布鲁塞尔——甚至整个比利时——的关系更大，而不是莫伦贝克：毕竟，布鲁塞尔不是马赛）。摄影师所说的“灰暗”也许也指的是某些街道上的脏乱，这些街道已经变成了真正的露天垃圾场，破碎的人行道上的垃圾有时会躺上几周，直到市容整洁部门最终清理掉（有时这会导致无比悲伤的场景，比如罗姆人过来捡拾邻居们留下的少量可回收垃圾，然后是东欧移民寻找金属——有穷人、更穷的人，还有更更穷的人）。

    is undeniable, and gets increasingly apparent. Some people logically turn toward
    the neighborhood’s main mosque, one of the most attended in the entire Brussels

    discourses (a practicing Morrocan man, who was my neighbor for several weeks,
    went there once: he came back horrified after hearing a violent rant against women).
    Despite claiming the contrary, this mosque had trained a great number of preachers
    who then embraced Salafism and left for Syria, sometimes seizing the opportunity
    to take local youth with them. A politician formerly part of the Molenbeek borough
    council, told me once that the mosque had been watched by intelligence services
    for years – but apparently their action was inefficient, as until very recently,
    a number of youth attending the place decided to “fight for the jihad.” (Since
    Friday, November 13th, the mosque’s home page has displayed a clear message forcefully
    condemning the Paris attacks; it was much appreciated, but it would be even more
    so if the Friday prayer was also open for non-Muslim people). One could also mention
    the more-or-less official mosques that pass for non-profit associations but turn
    out to organize meetings in obscure garages aiming at making disenfranchised young

    took place in front of Molebeek’s borough hall last Wednesday, a mosque official
    told me that he had repeatedly asked a number of Sharia4Belgium “representatives”
    from Antwerp to “clear off,” before reporting their presence to the police; another
    religious official claimed that some of the bearded proselytes pacing up and down

    “离开”，然后向警方报告他们的存在；另一位宗教官员声称，一些留着胡子的传教士在街上走来走去，他们是从英格兰来招募“新鲜血液”的。一切远比我们想象的要复杂，再次这些问题超越了莫伦贝克区本身。

    boroughs. In seven years, I was never once assaulted. Here, no cars are set on
    fire during New Year’s Eve; never have Molebeek or Brussels been the theatre of
    riots like Clichy-sous-Bois in 2005; even in the most difficult neighborhoods,
    the police rarely get stones thrown at them, while such a thing is extremely frequent
    in many Parisian suburbs. In terms of “communautarian attitudes,” the situation
    is far worse in some French suburbs than in Molenbeek. There is no such thing
    as a “Molenbeekistan,” contrary to what certain media outlets claim (even though,
    as this has been a known fact for years, there are urban areas where gunrunning
    and radical discourses go hand in hand, as is also the case in Anderlecht). In
    Molenbeek, “feelings of insecurity” stem more from cars driving up one-way streets
    in the wrong direction (a widespread local tendency) or going too fast (the street
    with the highest accident rate in Brussels is located in Molenbeek), from these
    grocery stores that barely hide their drug-selling activities, from the filth
    that plagues some of its streets. It is the various forms of diffuse, daily incivilities
    (among many others) that give birth to these “feelings of insecurity.” One could
    argue that borough agents indeed patrol in the street – some of whom have clearly
    been hired because of their Arabic-Muslim origins (in a way not dissimilar from
    the “older brothers” policy implemented in some French neighbourhoods) –, yet
    I was confused to see three of these agents walking in the street, shaking hands

  zh: Mollebek是比利时第二穷的区（不幸的记录属于另一个——而且远小——的布鲁塞尔市政府：圣若瑟 ten Noode，距离欧洲区仅一步之遥）；该区的某些社区在布鲁塞尔人口最密集的地区之一，大家庭构成了家庭的重要部分，自2000年代以来，穆斯林社区居住的社区的全球人口急剧增加（出生率在近几年大幅上升，是布鲁塞尔地区最高的）；年轻人（15-24岁）占总人口的比率特别高；死亡率高于区域平均水平，报告健康状况不佳的居民比例也高于区域平均水平；平均收入率低于全国平均水平，尤其是在人口最密集的地区，社会福利补助的数量大大超出了比例；因此，平均失业率自然高于区域平均水平，每两个年轻人中就有一个失业，这可能是因为参加普通教育的年轻人比例远低于区域平均水平。Mollebek居民的51%不需要支付所得税，每名居民的平均收入为每月€1.100，*57%的人口生活在贫困线以下*。
- en: 'Molenbeek is a poverty-stricken borough where more than one out of two inhabitants
    is just trying to survive, especially among the younger, under-educated population
    that becomes an easy prey for the bearded recruiters touring the streets. Beyond
    Molenbeek, and because, sadly, the journalist seldom report it, let us remind
    that within the capital of Europe, Brussels as a region, *a third of the population
    lives below the poverty line*, an edifying figure when, besides, it is known for
    fact that Brussels generates more wealth than the two other Belgian regions (it
    would be interesting to know if there is a relation between this figure and the
    recent statistics published by the International Organization for Migration revealing
    that 62% of the Brussels region population were foreign-born or coming from families
    that immigrated here, “which makes it the second-ranking city in that respect”).
    Thus Brussels is a highly contrasted region: in Molenbeek, the average monthly
    income per inhabitant is €776, that is, 4 times fewer than the single residence
    allowance given to a European commissioner, and 26 times fewer than his or her
    own income. (Let us add for the record that the European Union agents are exempted
    from the personal income tax that every taxable Belgian has to pay. In other words,
    a low-income Molenbeek resident paying this tax represents a more important source
    of funding for public infrastructures in Brussels than the European civil servants
    who thus benefit from them without paying this tax while earning considerably
    higher salaries – but so be it.)'

- en: 'Molenbeek is thus plagued by poverty. Few journalists point out that a couple
    of months ago, the borough was on the verge of bankruptcy (which once again gave
    a number of politicians the opportunity to stigmatize it even more): the reasons
    have been the increasing number of residents unable to pay taxes while mechanically
    needing more public resources (social welfare, etc.), combined with their impoverishment
    (the average income in Molenbeek has decreased by 5% over the last ten years),
    logically leading to a decrease of tax revenues; in parallel, according to a borough
    councilman who publicly spoke about this near-bankruptcy, the middle class (that
    is, the taxpaying class) is slowly disappearing: “The lack of cleanliness, of
    (quality) schooling, of decent, affordable housing and of pleasant public spaces,
    combined with feelings of insecurity, are the main causes of the middle class’
    departure from Molenbeek, especially young families.” It is hard to admit it,
    but Molenbeek’s downward spiral continues – it is a mechanic process. All of this
    therefore contributes, in certain neighborhoods, to turn this social and intellectual
    deprivation into a fertile ground for recruiters promoting an abject ideology.
    What future prospects, given its financial and social state of dilapidation, can
    this borough offer to a population on its way to pauperisation? How to fix a social

  zh: 因此，莫伦贝克深受贫困之苦。很少有记者指出，几个月前，这个区差点破产（这再次给许多政治家提供了进一步污名化该地区的机会）：原因是越来越多的居民无力支付税款，同时机械地需要更多的公共资源（如社会福利等），加上他们的贫困（过去十年间，莫伦贝克的平均收入下降了5%），逻辑上导致了税收收入的减少；与此同时，据一位公开谈论这次濒临破产的区议员说，中产阶级（即纳税阶级）正在慢慢消失：“清洁、（优质）教育、体面的、负担得起的住房和愉快的公共空间的缺乏，加上不安全感，是中产阶级离开莫伦贝克的主要原因，特别是年轻家庭。”虽然难以承认，但莫伦贝克的螺旋式下降仍在继续——这是一个机械过程。因此，所有这些因素都为招募宣传恶劣意识形态的招募者提供了一定的社会和智力剥夺的土壤。鉴于其财务和社会状况的破败，这个区能为正在走向贫困化的

    manages to accomplish a significant fieldwork on a shoestring, using subsidized
    contracts. After the Paris attacks, Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel announced

    of what has been done in the past.” Dear Mr Prime Minister, I thank you for publicly
    acknowledging the “laxity” of the public authorities in my borough; however, this
    is absolutely not an apology. We are collectively – the people of Molenbeek as
    much as of Paris – paying the “bill” (an odd term to describe the victims of an

    related to education, prevention, police and justice for too long.

    When the journalist asks Marcel Piccard, the then-mayor of Molenbeek, what he

    nursery and school construction plan has ever been anticipated? A new contemporary
    art museum will soon open on the banks of the canal that separates Molenbeek from
    Brussels. There is no doubt that this site will favour the rampant gentrification

    activities for school groups will surely be beneficial for certain children. However,
    we do not need a museum in Molenbeek; we need schools that provide a degree of

    here is not only “greyness.” There is, in Molenbeek, a small Bataclan of sorts

    various other places (such as the Musée de la Fonderie or the Molenbeek Centre
    for Cultures and Social Cohesion, managed by the borough administration). Molenbeek
    is not the “complete wilderness” that media outlets sometimes allude to, yet it
    is saddening to note that for the most part, these places are rarely attended
    by the inhabitants themselves (or at least by those living in the most communautarian
    neighborhoods). This is once again an educational issue: how can the cultural
    infrastructures of Molenbeek be attended by the borough’s residents when half
    of its population is just trying to survive and a third suffers from illiteracy?
    Associations such as Bonnevie, La Rue or Foyer also accomplish valuable fieldwork;
    without Foyer, Mrs Laanan would never have been able to take literacy courses,
    and her daughter Fadila would probably never have become minister of Culture,
    Communications, Public Health and Equal Opportunity. As I am writing this, Foyer

    feminine company (partner or sister) in order to avoid inappropriate looks; going
    to a “typical Brussels brewery” means “finding oneself around mostly older white
    people”; and going to a café where customers speak only Russian or Romanian doesn’t
    help exchanges. Here, people run into each other on the street, greet one another,
    sometimes exchange a few words in grocery stores, but essentially, we don’t talk
    and rarely laugh together. Simply because the places where one could do that are
    almost inexistent. Here, in these “sensitive neighborhoods,” it is virtually impossible
    to find a place such as La Belle Équipe, this Parisian café targeted by my neighbors
    that was owned by a *Jewish man* and a *Muslim woman* – it is unconceivable.

  zh: 值得注意的是，这些年轻的邻居们前往的地方恰恰在莫伦贝克不存在，或者非常稀少，这让人印象深刻，或许也不那么令人惊讶。这种“共性”的缺失非常清楚地是导致莫伦贝克困难区域不断下降的原因。可以肯定的是，我们可以在茶馆、几家具有布鲁塞尔风格的啤酒厂和由来自东欧的人们经营的酒吧之间进行选择。但去茶馆意味着没有女性陪伴（伴侣或姐妹）以避免不适当的目光；去“典型的布鲁塞尔啤酒厂”意味着“发现自己周围大多是年纪较大的白人”；而去只说俄语或罗马尼亚语的咖啡馆不利于交流。在这里，人们在街上偶遇，互相问候，有时在杂货店交换几句话，但本质上，我们并不交谈，很少一起笑。仅仅是因为可以这样做的地方几乎不存在。在这里，在这些“敏感街区”，几乎找不到像La
    Belle Équipe这样的地方，这家巴黎咖啡馆被我的邻居们target，由一名*犹太男子*和一名*穆斯林女性*经营——这是不可想象的。
- en: At the heart of a crumbling Europe, and at a time when barbed-wire fences start
    reappearing, at the heart of this capital of Europe where a third of the population
    live in destitution, at the heart of a borough from the capital city of Europe
    where dozens of thousands of people struggle to only survive, recovering the “common”
    in local, everyday terms is, beyond the political answers to the current disaster,
    a citizen’s project that everyone – Muslims, Jews, non-religious people, or anything
    else – will need to carry out together. Now the ball is in my Muslim neighbors’
    court. Maybe one day, even in a long time, I will sit in a neighborhood café owned
    by a Jewish man and spend some time with young Younès, who, if he ever comes back
    from Syria, won’t be that young anymore and who, if he is not entirely brainwashed
    by barbarism, will have some things to teach me about human madness.

  zh: 在一个日益衰败的欧洲中心，当电网篱笆开始重新出现时，在这个三分之一人口生活在贫困中的欧洲首都中心，在这个数以万计的人为生存而挣扎的欧洲首都区中心，恢复当地日常生活中的“共性”，超越对当前灾难的政治回答，是每个人都需要共同进行的公民项目——无论是穆斯林、犹太人、无神论者，还是其他人。现在球到了我的穆斯林邻居手里。也许有一天，甚至是很久以后，我会在一家由犹太人经营的社区咖啡馆里坐下，和年轻的Younès度过一些时间，如果他有一天从叙利亚回来，他不再那么年轻了，如果他没有完全被野蛮主义洗脑，他会有关于人类疯狂的一些东西教给我。
