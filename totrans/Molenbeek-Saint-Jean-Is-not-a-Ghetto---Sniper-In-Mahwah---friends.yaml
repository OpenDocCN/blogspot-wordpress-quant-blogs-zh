    the nature of exchanges and high-frequency trading. But for once I publish here
    today a quite personal take on Molenbeek-Saint-Jean, the now infamous city of
    Brussels where a lot of the Paris terrorists came from. Some of them were my direct
    neighbors. As an anthropologist, even if I didn’t work on my own city, I have
    been living in one of this Molenbeek* *neighborhood* *for seven years, and I have
    observed how the* *place* *have changed. I think intellectuals have a main duty
    –  inform people. Given what was written about Molenbeek the last ten days, I
    could not stay quiet. This post is not an attempt to understand the incomprehensible;
    this is just my point of view on Molenbeek-Saint-Jean. This op-ed was published
    in French by [Le Monde](http://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2015/11/23/molenbeek-saint-jean-n-est-pas-un-ghetto_4815791_3232.html) and
    I put on this blog a corrected [version](https://sniperinmahwah.wordpress.com/2015/11/24/molenbeek-saint-jean-nest-pas-un-ghetto/)*;
    *both versions were visited by more than 5,000 readers each. I thank you a lot
    all the readers who wrote me “Thank you for this text”. That’s the proofs words
    and long-read are helpful. Also, I thank you a lot my friend and translator Jean-François
    Caro who quickly translated my text in English – Jef, I owe you more than a couple
    of Belgian beers for that! If some misprints remain, they are all mines. Comments
    are possible, even if I don’t have the energy anymore to engage in a debate. Now
    it’s time to rest a little, after the last ten days of darkness.]*'

    some won’t be surprised to learn that a certain number of the terrorists who have
    spread death in Paris lived in my borough. The list of people from Molenbeek involved
    in international terrorist affairs is alas too long now – from Dahmane Abd al-Sattar,
    involved in Commander Massoud’s assassination in 2001, to Salah Abdeslam, held
    today to be among the principal culprits of the recent Parisian attacks, to a
    good dozen other individuals. Living and working in Molebeek-Saint-Jean, in the
    heart of one of the neighborhoods considered as the “Belgian hub for international
    Islamist terrorism,” a several dozens of meters from the apartment of one of those
    presumed responsible for the Parisian abominations, it is difficult not to write
    these few lines.

    asserted, Molenbeek is not a “suburb.” “Brussels” refers to one of the three Belgian
    Regions; it is composed of 19 *communes* or boroughs, among which “Brussels City”
    and Molenbeek. Even though an undeniable physical, social and symbolic boundary
    is traced by a canal running between the two boroughs, the center of “Brussels
    City” is only a 15-minute walk – or three subway stops – away from where I live.
    It therefore seems that “suburb” is shamefully employed to evoke those Île-de-France
    cities remote from the center of Paris where a Muslim community increasingly plagued
    by poverty – and thus by radicalism – allegedly resides. Molenbeek is not a suburb,
    and, just like the entire Brussels region, it is composed of highly disparate
    micro-neighborhoods. There are several Molenbeeks, and it is essential to take
    this disparity into account.

    look like? The answer is simple: most streets are lined with typical Brussels
    brick-houses, with the exception of a few “council estate”-styled buildings that
    blend into the surroundings. Without going back on the long and fascinating history
    of the borough (which sheltered exiled Parisian Communards in the 1870s, at a
    time when its flourishing industry earned it the nickname of “Little Manchester”),
    Molenbeek includes today several micro-neighborhoods composed for 80% of Belgian
    inhabitants belonging to a Muslim community that has major ties with Morocco,
    and among which a particularly high number of (sometimes very young) men or women
    have embraced the Jihadi cause in Syria. That said, the few statistic figures
    available show that while one half of the Belgians who left for Syria come from
    the Brussels region, the other half comes from Flanders, especially Vilvoorde
    and Antwerp – where in the latter city the Sharia4Belgium Salafist proselytes
    were identified as the main recruiters of Belgian jihadists by the Belgian authorities.
    The issue of Islamism extends beyond the limits of Molenbeek. The press has qualified
    the borough – or at least a number of its (micro-)neighborhoods – as a “ghetto.”
    In spite of my doubts regarding the true meaning of the term (unless, following
    Max Weber, we define it as an “excluding closure”), the wealthy borough of Uccle,
    brimming with French tax exiles, is to me far more “ghetto-ized” than my own borough,
    a place characterized by its diversity, where more than 100 nationalities live
    without the slightest inter-community tension.'

    who left his parents shaken with incomprehension. He was taken to Syria by his
    older brother, Adbelhamid Abaaoud, one of the main alleged backers of the recent
    Paris attacks, who died in Saint-Denis. Younès went to school at several hundred
    yards from where I live, and I have often thought that I may have crossed his
    path at some point. Maybe he was that kid who looked up from his portable PlayStation
    and smiled at me as he walked in my street, ten feet behind his mother covered
    in black from head to toes, hands included, herself walking ten feet behind a
    husband absorbed in prayer. It would be dishonest not to write that since several

    Nowadays, it is not unusual to see 5-year old girls walking in the street wearing
    a beautiful, coloured hijab –while this was far less frequent, and even nonexistent,
    a couple of years ago. Despite being banned from the public space, the niqab is
    quite visible in front of the closest school from where I live. In the old local
    post office, it is not unusual to hear religious chants playing on cell phones
    (I once asked a woman to mute the sound, arguing that she shouldn’t impose me
    prayers from a religion that was not mine; she immediately complied, but I could
    tell by the look in her eyes that she felt it was an odd demand). It is not unusual,
    either, to find flyers stacked on bakery counters advertising one Muslim event
    or the other, adorned with the faces of foreign preachers who, it turns out after
    a brief Internet search, appear in videos where they call for “burning the Jews.”
    Let’s not forget the sinister-looking bearded proselytes who move in groups of
    three, going from door to door or lecturing young people hanging out in the street.
    In early 2015, a war photographer and anthropologist decided to leave Molenbeek,
    explaining his decision as follows: “[Here] everything has gone grey, everything
    reeks of pessimism. The radicalism and the gloom that have taken hold of my neighborhood
    have thrown me in a depression. I find it terrible that certain people have tried
    to convert me to Islam in the street.” While no-one has ever tried to convert
    me, I sadly share the same conclusions regarding this greyness and pessimism (even
    though greyness has more to do with Brussels – if not Belgium – than with Molenbeek
    itself: after all, Brussels is not Marseille). Perhaps what the photographer called
    “greyness” also referred to the filth that litters certain streets that have become
    genuine open-air garbage dumps with smashed sidewalks where the trash sometimes
    lies for weeks before the borough collection service ends up cleaning it (which
    at times lead to infinitely sad scenes, such as when Romani come to pick up the
    what little reusable waste is left by their neighbors, followed by Eastern-European
    immigrants looking for metal – there are the poor, the poorer, then the even poorer).'

    discourses (a practicing Morrocan man, who was my neighbor for several weeks,
    went there once: he came back horrified after hearing a violent rant against women).
    Despite claiming the contrary, this mosque had trained a great number of preachers
    who then embraced Salafism and left for Syria, sometimes seizing the opportunity
    to take local youth with them. A politician formerly part of the Molenbeek borough
    council, told me once that the mosque had been watched by intelligence services
    for years – but apparently their action was inefficient, as until very recently,
    a number of youth attending the place decided to “fight for the jihad.” (Since
    Friday, November 13th, the mosque’s home page has displayed a clear message forcefully
    condemning the Paris attacks; it was much appreciated, but it would be even more
    so if the Friday prayer was also open for non-Muslim people). One could also mention
    the more-or-less official mosques that pass for non-profit associations but turn
    out to organize meetings in obscure garages aiming at making disenfranchised young

    heated debates on the state of Islam in Belgium – according to Brussels minister
    Rachid Madrane, “the original sin for Belgium was to give Saudi Arabia the keys
    to Islam in 1973.” During the civil gathering in homage to the Paris victims that
    took place in front of Molebeek’s borough hall last Wednesday, a mosque official
    told me that he had repeatedly asked a number of Sharia4Belgium “representatives”
    from Antwerp to “clear off,” before reporting their presence to the police; another
    religious official claimed that some of the bearded proselytes pacing up and down
    the streets travelled from England to recruit “fresh fodder.” Everything is far
    more complex than what we imagine, and once again these issues extend beyond the

    terrace of a café in Paris. This goes far beyond religion, despite the involvement

    closed by administrative decision in early November on the grounds of “drug trafficking.”
    Every local knows that many cafés or grocery stores – where only a couple of Coke
    bottles sit on the shelves next to three crisp packets – are in fact drug-dealing
    spots. The nice kebab-shop owner from down my street was unfortunately replaced
    for several months by such a café, where young bearded men smoked cannabis on

    religion and of the drug-selling cafés, Molenbeek is not more dangerous than other
    boroughs. In seven years, I was never once assaulted. Here, no cars are set on
    fire during New Year’s Eve; never have Molebeek or Brussels been the theatre of
    riots like Clichy-sous-Bois in 2005; even in the most difficult neighborhoods,
    the police rarely get stones thrown at them, while such a thing is extremely frequent
    in many Parisian suburbs. In terms of “communautarian attitudes,” the situation
    is far worse in some French suburbs than in Molenbeek. There is no such thing
    as a “Molenbeekistan,” contrary to what certain media outlets claim (even though,
    as this has been a known fact for years, there are urban areas where gunrunning
    and radical discourses go hand in hand, as is also the case in Anderlecht). In
    Molenbeek, “feelings of insecurity” stem more from cars driving up one-way streets
    in the wrong direction (a widespread local tendency) or going too fast (the street
    with the highest accident rate in Brussels is located in Molenbeek), from these
    grocery stores that barely hide their drug-selling activities, from the filth
    that plagues some of its streets. It is the various forms of diffuse, daily incivilities
    (among many others) that give birth to these “feelings of insecurity.” One could
    argue that borough agents indeed patrol in the street – some of whom have clearly
    been hired because of their Arabic-Muslim origins (in a way not dissimilar from
    the “older brothers” policy implemented in some French neighbourhoods) –, yet
    I was confused to see three of these agents walking in the street, shaking hands
    with notorious local drug dealers while speaking in Arabic, before peacefully
    moving on?

    income per inhabitant is €776, that is, 4 times fewer than the single residence
    allowance given to a European commissioner, and 26 times fewer than his or her
    own income. (Let us add for the record that the European Union agents are exempted
    from the personal income tax that every taxable Belgian has to pay. In other words,
    a low-income Molenbeek resident paying this tax represents a more important source
    of funding for public infrastructures in Brussels than the European civil servants
    who thus benefit from them without paying this tax while earning considerably
    higher salaries – but so be it.)'

    of months ago, the borough was on the verge of bankruptcy (which once again gave
    a number of politicians the opportunity to stigmatize it even more): the reasons
    have been the increasing number of residents unable to pay taxes while mechanically
    needing more public resources (social welfare, etc.), combined with their impoverishment
    (the average income in Molenbeek has decreased by 5% over the last ten years),
    logically leading to a decrease of tax revenues; in parallel, according to a borough
    councilman who publicly spoke about this near-bankruptcy, the middle class (that
    is, the taxpaying class) is slowly disappearing: “The lack of cleanliness, of
    (quality) schooling, of decent, affordable housing and of pleasant public spaces,
    combined with feelings of insecurity, are the main causes of the middle class’
    departure from Molenbeek, especially young families.” It is hard to admit it,
    but Molenbeek’s downward spiral continues – it is a mechanic process. All of this
    therefore contributes, in certain neighborhoods, to turn this social and intellectual
    deprivation into a fertile ground for recruiters promoting an abject ideology.

    home, where a major police operation took place. Journalists and passers-by were
    gathered at both ends of the street that was barricaded by the police. I spent
    two hours there. There was nothing to see but a lot to hear: journalists were
    interviewing young people and locals were speaking with each other. I talked to
    several neighbors about the stigmatization of the borough that has been rampant
    since a number of years because of radicalism, about the filthy streets, about
    the fact a perfectly trilingual neighbor (Arabic, French, Dutch) finally got a
    job because he had removed his Molenbeek address from his resumé, and so on. There
    was no tension, but many discussions.'

- en: 'That same night, during the 7:30pm news broadcast, La Une – the main French-speaking
    public TV channel – reported on the operation, claiming that “the entire neighborhood
    was shutdown,” which was untrue: only one street and one intersection were concerned,
    and one could perfectly move around them, which I did when I had to meet the Brussels
    correspondent for the *Financial Times* (the only journalist – alas – who contacted
    me after I had invited the media to do so on via social networks if they wished
    to hear an “insider’s point of view”). The neighborhood had nothing to do with
    the “no-go zone” described on television. More pathetic still, the journalist
    mentioned the state of “severe tension” that weighed on the theatre of operations.
    This is pure disinformation: there was no tension whatsoever, everyone exchanged
    their thoughts without the slightest confrontational tone, even when people disagreed
    (I had such a disagreement, and quite a strong one, with a young man who knew
    Salah Abdeslam well, calling him a “pretentious muppet,” yet things never came
    to a head).'

- en: Molenbeek has been pilloried in a large part of the Western world, rightly or
    wrongly, and what we residents of Molenbeek need is that journalist do their job
    more seriously instead of crushing us down some more. A technician from French
    channel TF1, who had covered the violence riots in Clichy-sous-Bois in 2005, told
    me he was extremely surprise by the kindness of Molenbeek inhabitants during interviews,
    compared to the aggressiveness of certain “Parisian *banlieusards*.” What he had
    learned about the borough, through the media, provided him with a disastrous image,
    so much that he seemed glad to observe that he had been given a fallacious representation
    – proof, if we ever needed one, that the media are responsible for this. On Wednesday
    night, during the civil gathering in homage for the victims, a journalist for
    the BBC facing the camera declared that “there were only white people here,” which
    was obviously false – excluding the hundreds of journalists, a good 2.000 of the
    inhabitants that came together that night belonged to the “Muslim community.”
    Denying its presence to the world during this gathering is disgustingly vile toward
    Muslims.

- en: '3/ Beyond endemic poverty and the weight of religion, my neighborhood mainly
    suffers from one thing: the near total lack of “common.” I can cross the canal
    in five minutes by bike and join my friends for a drink near this waterway that
    separates me from the true diversity of thought, but there is no café like Le
    Carillon, Le Petit Cambodge, Le Café Bonne Bière, La Belle Équipe or Le Comptoir
    Voltaire in my own micro-neighborhood, these Parisian places of encounter and
    of merriment, where people from every origin and of every political or religious
    conviction got together around a drink before dying under bullets shot by my neighbors.'

- en: It is striking, though maybe not all that surprising, to note that these young
    neighbors went to spread death in gathering places that precisely do not exist
    in Molenbeek, or are so rare. This lack of “common” is very clearly what increasingly
    drives down the difficult areas of Molenbeek. To be sure, we may choose between
    tea salons, a few typical Brussels-style breweries, and bars frequently owned
    by people from Eastern Europe. But to go to a tea salon means to go there without
    feminine company (partner or sister) in order to avoid inappropriate looks; going
    to a “typical Brussels brewery” means “finding oneself around mostly older white
    people”; and going to a café where customers speak only Russian or Romanian doesn’t
    help exchanges. Here, people run into each other on the street, greet one another,
    sometimes exchange a few words in grocery stores, but essentially, we don’t talk
    and rarely laugh together. Simply because the places where one could do that are
    almost inexistent. Here, in these “sensitive neighborhoods,” it is virtually impossible
    to find a place such as La Belle Équipe, this Parisian café targeted by my neighbors
    that was owned by a *Jewish man* and a *Muslim woman* – it is unconceivable.

- en: At the heart of a crumbling Europe, and at a time when barbed-wire fences start
    reappearing, at the heart of this capital of Europe where a third of the population
    live in destitution, at the heart of a borough from the capital city of Europe
    where dozens of thousands of people struggle to only survive, recovering the “common”
    in local, everyday terms is, beyond the political answers to the current disaster,
    a citizen’s project that everyone – Muslims, Jews, non-religious people, or anything
    else – will need to carry out together. Now the ball is in my Muslim neighbors’
    court. Maybe one day, even in a long time, I will sit in a neighborhood café owned
    by a Jewish man and spend some time with young Younès, who, if he ever comes back
    from Syria, won’t be that young anymore and who, if he is not entirely brainwashed
    by barbarism, will have some things to teach me about human madness.
