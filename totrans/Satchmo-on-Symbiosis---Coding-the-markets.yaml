- en: I’m going a little bit off topic here, as this post has no trading or finance
    content. However, it’s good to share, and hopefully this will help anyone out
    there struggling with a [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) based web dev
    stack on a [Bytemark](http://www.bytemark.co.uk) [Symbiosis](http://www.bytemark.co.uk/hosting/symbiosis)
    host. I’m using [Satchmo](http://www.satchmoproject.com/) for an ecommerce site.
    But a lot of the detail will be applicable to any Django based web site. If you’re
    hosting plain old HTML, or PHP, then Symbiosis is fine and dandy. If you want
    to get Satchmo or Django running you’ve got a bit more work to do as Symbiosis
    is Bytemark’s own Debian Lenny distro with Python 2.5 and no GCC. The ecommerce
    site I’m deploying has been developed with Python 2.7.2, Django 1.3.1 and Satchmo
    0.9.2\. So I needed to build up the whole thing from scratch, starting with an
    apt-get for GCC and a Python 2.7.2 source build. Here’s the recipe I followed.
    Note that I’m omitting all the directory tree specific cds, gunzips and ‘tar xvf’s
    from the commands, but leaving in all the fiddly cmd line options that can take
    ages to figure out…
