    1](http://timelyportfolio.blogspot.com/2011/04/bond-market-as-casino-game-part-1.html),

    returns to build our skills in the lattice R package and help visualize the unbelievable
    run of U.S. bonds ([Calmar Ratio 1.37 over the past 20 years](Bonds%20Tumble%20and%20Questions%20Start%20Getting%20Asked)).
