- en: Kafka’s [design](http://incubator.apache.org/kafka/design.html) page provides
    a few use cases, around “activity streams”.  Of interesting is the list of companies
    [mentioned](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Powered+By) that
    are using Kafka – in particular [Metamarkets](http://metamx.com/), a company I
    have blogged about before in the big data analysis space.

    of the site. Activity data is things like page views, information about what content
    was shown, searches, etc. This kind of thing is usually handled by logging the
    activity out to some kind of file and then periodically aggregating these files
    for analysis

    product that are commercially available from various vendors e.g. B2BITS with
    its [FIX](http://qwtradingsystem.com/documents/QWFIX/main/Getting%20Started/Features%20Tour/QWFIX%20RTAnalyzer/1.FIXMessageMonitoring.htm)

- en: Further, assuming you now have this data, it maybe interesting to “count” FIX
    messages, which [possibly](http://www.slideshare.net/dave_revell/nearrealtime-analytics-with-kafka-and-hbase#)
    leads us to [data cube](https://github.com/urbanairship/datacube) (backed by HBase).
