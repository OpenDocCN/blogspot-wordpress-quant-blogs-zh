    people tried to guess the weight of an ox. To Galton's surprise, the average of
    all the guesses was 1,197 lbs. The actual weight came in at 1,198 lbs. Other studies
    have confirmed that a diverse crowd is better at estimates than any single expert.

    gain a consistent edge. Technical analysis is one way of listening to the markets,
    and applying its message to understand what the market is discounting.
