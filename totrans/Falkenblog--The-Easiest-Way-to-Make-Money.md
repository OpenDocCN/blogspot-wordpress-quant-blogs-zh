Former UBS banker Bradley Birkenfeld won $104m for exposing the giant Swiss bank’s efforts—illegal in America but not in its home country—to help American taxpayers hide money in offshore accounts. I think the take-away is that any organization involved in large-scale illegalities should realize that the incentive to turn over insider evidence is huge now, and this should dissuade law-breaking of this scale, which is a good thing. However, a huge organization will necessarily have many gray areas because bidding is strategic, and so could always be seen as conspiratorial by some, or have disparate impact. Thus, this probably massively increases the amount of bureaucracy that already weakens these companies.

His phone has rung incessantly since the settlement.

Writing complex legislation has its advantages.
