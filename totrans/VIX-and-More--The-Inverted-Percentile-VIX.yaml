    of the VIX, one of the most obvious is an issue of orientation: for the most part,
    the VIX moves in the opposite direction of stocks. Frankly, it is difficult to
    appreciate some of the nuances of an upside-down world unless you spend a lot
    of time hanging upside down looking out at the world, like a bat.'

    back in August 2007\. At that time, the VIX had just spiked into the mid-20s only
    two months after having traded in the 12s. The chart below is an updated version
    of the inverted VIX over the course of the past year and demonstrates that for
    the most part, the SPX and the inverted VIX track fairly closely, though there
    are times, such as just prior to the [fiscal cliff](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/fiscal%20cliff)
    denouement, when the VIX sometimes strikes out on its own path.

    June 2007 – and once again investors are grappling for the proper context. Let
    me throw a new concept into the mix that may help: the [inverted percentile VIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/inverted%20percentile%20VIX),
    a distant cousin of the inverted VIX. The way to think about the inverted percentile
    VIX is in terms of the lifetime of VIX values, in which a VIX of 12.50 is in the
    12.2 percentile. The inverse of that is the 87.8 percentile, which corresponds
    with a VIX of 28.67\. Now I am guessing that for most investors a VIX of 12.50
    *feels* much lower than a VIX of 28.67 feels high. Statistically they are almost
    identical in terms of being outliers, so if a 28.67 VIX doesn’t sound like a scary
    high number, then a VIX of 12.50 should not sound like a scary low number that
    is reflecting too much complacency.'

    or, failing that, take advantage of the relatively low VIX by buying some VIX
    calls so as to profit when the rest of the world comes to the realization that
    a VIX in the 12s is making them too nervous. Keep in mind, however, that current
    10-day [historical volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/historical%20volatility)
    of the SPX is in the 5s, so that number would have to double just to be able to
    support the current level of the VIX going forward.
