    the relative performance of the Russell 2000 small cap stocks against the large

    below shows two measures of the risk-on/risk-off trade. The first is the Tiffany/WalMart
    pair (in black) and the second is the Consumer Discretionary/Consumer Staple pair
    (in purple). Both are turning down, indicating that bullish enthusiasm is softening.

    of European small caps to European large caps to the US chart above. This spells

    shows that Greek stocks rallied through a relative downtrend line and they appear
    to be staging a relative bottom against eurozone stocks. The short term picture,
    shown by the red arrow, is equally encouraging as Greek stocks continue to outperform
    in the last few months.

    chart of the relative performance of European financials relative to the market.
    The technical pattern is similar to the ones seen for the relative performance
    of other eurozone peripheral markets. Financials have rallied out of a relative
    downtrend and their performance is starting to turn up.

    against the SPX. Sure, they bottomed and rallied out of a relative downtrend line
    and started to outperform. But why is their relative performance starting to roll
    over again?

    for their equity commitments as both the short and longer term picture are supportive
    of further gains. There is the caveat, however, that European equities have rallied
    a lot and they may be no longer be cheap.

    2011, as I noted yesterday, needs to show some signs of life. That, in turn, requires
    that European economic indicators show that the region’s economy hasn’t just bottomed,
    but is actually recovering. The latest batch of these indicators does show a recovery,
    but a slow-paced one that may already have been discounted by the rebound in valuation
    multiples.
