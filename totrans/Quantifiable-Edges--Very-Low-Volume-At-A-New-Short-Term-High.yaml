    much as normal but blog posts tend to suffer. I’m back and will have a couple
    of posts this week and then get back to the 3 or so per week starting next week.

- en: Very light volume at new highs as we saw on Friday often indicates a rally is
    running out of buyers. Frequently such light volume is followed by a pullback
    in the next few days. There were several studies that appeared in the Quantifinder
    Friday that demonstrated this point. I’ve chosen one that was also in the Subscriber
    Letter to highlight below.  Blog readers last saw this study on April 5, 2011.

- en: This study looks back to the inception of the SPY in 1993. The numbers above
    look fairly compelling. I also found the edge to be quite steady over the tested
    period. Of course with the gap down in the futures, much of the downside edge
    may be realized quicker than usual today. It’s possible it won’t persist for as
    long. Nonetheless, as I’ve shown many times before, [volume does matter](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/search/label/volume)
    and traders should pay attention to it.
