In a seminal

[amicus curiae](http://www.venganza.org/about/open-letter/)

to the Kansas City Council in their Intelligent Design debate, along with introducing the

[Flying Spaghetti Monster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Spaghetti_Monster)

to ethnocentric atheists, Billy Henderson

[introduced the famous 'pirate effect'](http://www.venganza.org/about/open-letter/)

, which showed conclusively that the number of pirates is inversely related to mean global temperature: hotter earth, fewer pirates.

The

[recent pirate attacks](http://voanews.com/english/2008-11-25-voa60.cfm)

, such as the takeover of a $100MM supertanker well off the coast of Kenya, should therefore come as no surprise. As shown below in a chart of monthly satellite recordings from 2003-8, world temperatures have fallen drastically in the past year.

As sure as night follows the day, pirate attacks increased sharply.

It would be a mistake in logical inference of the first order, however, to blame 'global cooling' per se, because we all know that

[global cooling is a direct consequence of global warming](http://www.dinosauria.com/jdp/news/freeze.html)

, via interactions implied by climate models.
