    a way to hedge my portfolio using options ought to be second nature by now. In
    fact, I have always placed more emphasis on offense than defense, not because
    I underestimate the importance of risk management, but because I generally find
    the opportunity cost of portfolio protection to be too high. I am sure this will
    sound like heresy to some, but the truth is that I never want to pay the full
    price for portfolio protection, so my efforts at hedging my portfolio have always
    emphasized finding the narrowest possible hedge for my needs and limiting the
    cost of that hedge as much as possible. In a nutshell, my approach is to try to
    figure out where the best place is to cut the corners and shave the odds, without
    significantly increasing my exposure. An academic may refer to this as creating
    a bespoke or customized hedge. I prefer to think in lay terms of cheating the
    odds. With the above in mind, the balance of this article attempts to explain
    how I look at constructing custom partial hedges.

    protection provides insurance against losses for a fixed percentage of each dollar
    lost

- en: The common theme in each of the above three hedging strategy approaches is that
    an investor chooses partial protection rather than full protection, based on an
    assessment of the extent to which he or she finds losses to be an acceptable risk
    and at what losses must be hedged in order to preserve trading capital.

    normally associated with the insurance industry in order help clarify some important
    concepts. Specifically, I use the term deductible to describe the portion of a
    portfolio that is unhedged and thus 100% at risk. As Figure 1 below shows, in
    the case of a Disaster Protection Hedge, the deductible amount is equal to the
    first 20% of the losses that are unhedged, before the insurance threshold is triggered.
    In options parlance, the example in Figure 1 would be equivalent to holding a
    long position in SPY at 130 and having the position hedged with long SPY 104 puts,
    as 104 = 130 * 80%.

    disastrous fall in stocks, such as the experience in 2008, in reality a 100-year
    flood does not happen very often and can be an expensive hedge to maintain on
    a daily basis. For this reason, I like the idea of what I call a Gap Protection
    Hedge. As shown in Figure 2 below, an investor might think that it is unlikely
    stocks will decline 20% or more, so he or she might prefer to remain unprotected
    for a 10% drop (i.e., a 10% deductible), yet be hedged dollar for dollar for any
    loss from 10% up to 20%. The maximum benefit of this hedge is capped at 20%, so
    once losses begin to exceed 20%, the investor is fully exposed to any incremental
    losses. In the options world, this type of protection would be similar to holding
    a long position in SPY at 130, with a hedge consisting of long SPY 117 puts and
    an equal amount of short SPY 104 puts.

- en: While I find it helpful to think about hedged in terms of deductible thresholds
    and maximum benefits caps, proportional protection has the benefit of simplicity.
    In insurance terms, this is similar in some respects to a co-pay. As illustrated
    in Figure 3 below, there is no deductible or cap with proportional protection
    and the insurance coverage begins with the first dollar lost. This example shows
    how 50% proportional protection looks in graphical form. Here a 20% drop in the
    stock market only translates into a 10% loss due to the partial offset of the
    hedge. In the example below, the options equivalent for this strategy would be
    a position of 1000 shares of SPY that are hedged by 5 at-the-money puts. Of course,
    as the contract multiplier for SPY options is 100 shares, one can fully hedge
    1000 shares with 10 puts, meaning that 5 puts would represent a 50% hedge.

    hedging strategies mentioned above, the real fun begins when you consider these
    hedges as building blocks which allow an investor to design custom hedges.

- en: For example, let us assume one is comfortable with accepting the first 10% drawdown
    as a cost of doing business and is willing to remain unhedged for the first 10%
    of portfolio losses. At some point, an investor will likely want a hedge to begin
    to offset some portion of incremental losses, yet might still think protection
    is too expensive to warrant being fully covered at a pullback of 10% or 20%. This
    investor might also think that stocks are unlikely to fall more than 30%, yet
    may not want his or her portfolio to suffer losses in excess of 20%.

- en: One way to structure a hedge that meets all these requirements would be to buy
    gap protection for stock market losses from 10% to 20%, have proportional protection
    of 50% to cover losses from 20% to 30% and rely on disaster insurance in the event
    losses exceed 30%. Here the total maximum loss is 20% (the first 10% and 50% of
    the next 20%) and the hedge is structured in such a way that the investor pays
    nothing for the most expensive insurance (the first 10%), gets a discount on the
    next most expensive insurance (the proportional insurance for the next 20%) and
    only pays full price for the most unlikely events, where the markets fall more
    than 30%.

    put more faith in their trading skills than their hedging skills. Like any high
    wire-act, however, successful traders need a safety net to allow them to perform
    complex and dangerous maneuvers.

    and potential maximum drawdowns have many ways in which to structure hedges to
    limit their risk. This article highlights three different approaches to structuring
    partial hedges for the purpose of maximizing portfolio protection while minimizing
    the cost of these hedges as well as the magnitude of certain types of risk. By
    combining these different partial hedging strategies, traders can customize their
    risk exposure to match individual needs and ensure that appropriate hedges can
    be constructed in a manner that is as cost efficient as possible.
