- en: powerful trading desk head treats regulators and risk managers, whith duplicity
    and contempt. Not at this level, and not that everyone is a fraud like Madoff,
    but truly independent risk managers are considered lightweights, and eager to
    join those they are policing. In UBS's Report to Shareholders, they noted their
    Internal Audit group did 250 reviews a year. With that many reviews, the analysis
    is pretty superficial. It's a mismatch.

    should not be trusted, because it is simply too calculating, as if they know they
    are regularly committing crimes. A phone conversation can always be disavowed,
    you just say you were talking about last weekend's bar mitzvah.

    he executes, you know, a huge percentage of the industry''s orders [...] We make

    was--see if they get any bites, if not, move on. He reminded the risk manager
    that SEC personnel were young guys looking to get jobs at hedge funds as compliance
    officers, making them eager to accept anything they said.
