    of different approaches that range from theoretical like Mean-Variance to heuristic
    like Minimum Correlation or even “tactical strategies.” Another challenge is defining
    an appropriate asset class universe which can lead to insidious biases that even
    experienced practitioners can fail to grasp or appreciate. Reducing dimensionality
    and the number of assumptions is the ultimate goal. The simplest way to manage
    a portfolio is to revert to a CAPM world where there is a market portfolio and
    you can leverage or hold cash to meet your risk tolerance requirements. But this
    method also requires one to define a “market portfolio” which in theory can be
    defined as the market-cap weighted mix of investable asset classes, but in practice
    is elusive to define and also determine on a real-time basis. What we really want
    is a sense of what drives systematic risk across a range of asset classes and
    to identify a portfolio that best represents that systematic risk (offense), and
    a portfolio that is inversely correlated to that systematic risk (defense). A
    parsimonious way to make that determination is to use Principal Component Analysis
    (PCA) by isolating the PC1 or first principal component portfolio that explains
    most of the variation across a broad set of asset classes. In most cases, the
    first principal component will explain between 60-70% of the variation across
    asset classes and represents a core systematic risk factor. If we take a large
    basket of core asset classes we can use PCA to identify this PC1 portfolio over
    the period from 1995-2018 using ETFs with index extensions. In this case we used
    the R code provided by Jim Picerno’s excellent new book [Quantitative Investment
    Portfolio Analytics in R](http://www.capitalspectator.com/excerpt-part-ii-quantitative-investment-portfolio-analytics-in-r/).

    weights are in Emerging Markets, Nasdaq/Technology,  and Small Cap (Offense).
    Asset classes with negative weights have an inverse relationship to this core
    systematic risk factor, and the lowest are Long-Term Treasurys followed by Intermediate
    Treasurys, Inflation-Protected Treasurys, the Aggregate Bond Index and Short-Term
    Treasurys  (Defense).  Effectively the  “Offense” portfolio is positively tilted
    toward the most aggressive asset classes that likely perform the best during a
    bull market, while the “Defense” portfolio is positively tilted toward the most
    defensive asset classes that likely perform the best in a bear markets. With one
    calculation we have mathematically separated the asset classes into two broad
    groups/dimensions which can be used to create a wide variety of different simple
    asset allocation schemes. In a subsequent post we will show some examples of how
    this can be done.'

  zh: 可以看出，这个PC1投资组合具有很强的直观合理性：权重最高的是新兴市场、纳斯达克/科技以及小盘股（进攻型）。具有负权重的资产类别与这一核心系统性风险因素呈反向关系，权重最低的依次是长期国债、中期国债、通胀保护国债、综合债券指数和短期国债（防御型）。实际上，“进攻”组合倾向于配置最具攻击性的资产类别，这些资产类别在牛市中可能表现最佳；而“防御”组合则倾向于配置最具防御性的资产类别，这些资产类别在熊市中可能表现最佳。通过一次计算，我们已将资产类别数学上划分为两大类/维度，可用于构建多种不同的简单资产配置方案。在后续的文章中，我们将展示一些如何实现这一点的示例。
