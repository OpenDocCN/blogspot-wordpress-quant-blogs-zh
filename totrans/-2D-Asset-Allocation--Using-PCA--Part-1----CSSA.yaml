- en: Asset allocation is a complex problem that can be solved using endless variations
    of different approaches that range from theoretical like Mean-Variance to heuristic
    like Minimum Correlation or even “tactical strategies.” Another challenge is defining
    an appropriate asset class universe which can lead to insidious biases that even
    experienced practitioners can fail to grasp or appreciate. Reducing dimensionality
    and the number of assumptions is the ultimate goal. The simplest way to manage
    a portfolio is to revert to a CAPM world where there is a market portfolio and
    you can leverage or hold cash to meet your risk tolerance requirements. But this
    method also requires one to define a “market portfolio” which in theory can be
    defined as the market-cap weighted mix of investable asset classes, but in practice
    is elusive to define and also determine on a real-time basis. What we really want
    is a sense of what drives systematic risk across a range of asset classes and
    to identify a portfolio that best represents that systematic risk (offense), and
    a portfolio that is inversely correlated to that systematic risk (defense). A
    parsimonious way to make that determination is to use Principal Component Analysis
    (PCA) by isolating the PC1 or first principal component portfolio that explains
    most of the variation across a broad set of asset classes. In most cases, the
    first principal component will explain between 60-70% of the variation across
    asset classes and represents a core systematic risk factor. If we take a large
    basket of core asset classes we can use PCA to identify this PC1 portfolio over
    the period from 1995-2018 using ETFs with index extensions. In this case we used
    the R code provided by Jim Picerno’s excellent new book [Quantitative Investment
    Portfolio Analytics in R](http://www.capitalspectator.com/excerpt-part-ii-quantitative-investment-portfolio-analytics-in-r/).

    weights are in Emerging Markets, Nasdaq/Technology,  and Small Cap (Offense).
    Asset classes with negative weights have an inverse relationship to this core
    systematic risk factor, and the lowest are Long-Term Treasurys followed by Intermediate
    Treasurys, Inflation-Protected Treasurys, the Aggregate Bond Index and Short-Term
    Treasurys  (Defense).  Effectively the  “Offense” portfolio is positively tilted
    toward the most aggressive asset classes that likely perform the best during a
    bull market, while the “Defense” portfolio is positively tilted toward the most
    defensive asset classes that likely perform the best in a bear markets. With one
    calculation we have mathematically separated the asset classes into two broad
    groups/dimensions which can be used to create a wide variety of different simple
    asset allocation schemes. In a subsequent post we will show some examples of how
    this can be done.'
