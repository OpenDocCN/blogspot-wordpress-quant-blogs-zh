    I first posted a slightly different version of the chart below on the blog. The
    chart turned out to be a surprise hit, so this time around I am updating the data
    (a proprietary methodology in which I evaluate the performance of key economic

    index as a beige area graphic.

    and consumer data continue to drag down the economic recovery. Manufacturing,
    which was an area of strength early in the year, has more recently become a source
    of weakness. In terms of strength, I continue to be surprised that the aggregated

    numbers are better than consensus estimates.
