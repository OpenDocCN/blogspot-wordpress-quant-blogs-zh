    the New York market began in the red, but recovered to be positive for the day.

    base case scenario is the melt-up is not over. The geopolitical shock represents
    a welcome test for both the bulls and the bears. Watch for a minor pause in the
    market, followed by further gains marked by negative divergences and an inverting
    VIX term structure. Those will be the signals for traders to sell. Assuming our
    bullish thesis is intact, the market is sufficiently oversold levels for prices
    to bounce.
