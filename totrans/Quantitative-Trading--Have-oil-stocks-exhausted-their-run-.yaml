- en: Floyd Norris, the chief financial correspondent of The New York Times, suggested
    in his [blog](http://norris.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/26/the-beginning-of-the-end-for-high-oil-prices/)
    today that we are looking at "The Beginning of the End for High Oil Prices". What
    is the basis of his optimism? He argued that oil stocks have been lagging oil
    prices lately, and therefore equity investors must believe that high oil prices
    are causing demand destruction which will eventually reduce oil prices and oil
    companies earnings.
