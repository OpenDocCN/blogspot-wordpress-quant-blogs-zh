# TimeSeries AggregatoR – TSAR | Tales from a Trading Desk

## TimeSeries AggregatoR – TSAR

InfoQ’s [presentation](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/tsar) “TSAR: How to Count Tens of Billions of Daily Events in Real Time Using Open Source Technologies” is worth viewing if you have time.  Apart from the beer trending (24:10), I’d be interested in knowing if anyone in capital markets has looked at user TSAR to understand customer trends, order trends, etc.
