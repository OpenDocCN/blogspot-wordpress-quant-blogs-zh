    speculative activity into risky assets. The [Inflation-Deflation Timer Model](http://www.qwestfunds.com/publications/newsletters_pdf/newsletter_november_2009.pdf)
    uses commodity prices as the canaries in the mine and those canaries are chirping
    quite happily. These readings indicate the "inflation" or high beta trade of commodities,
    commodity producers and emerging market equities. A tour around the world of global
    equities confirm the uptrend. Virtually all developed markets are either in constructive
    uptrends or have broken out to new recovery highs.'

    concerned about excessive bullishness in investor surveys, as well as option sentiment
    readings. Given the strong momentum exhibited by global markets, this suggests
    that any weakness should be viewed as corrections and opportunities to deploy
    new cash rather than an intermediate term top.'

    defaults loom. European sovereign risks could sink the banking system. China could
    miscalculate and tighten itself into a hard landing. For the time being, however,
    any problem is more likely to manifest itself in the 2H.'

    long risky assets but maintain an appropriate risk control discipline in order
    to allow winners to run and limit downside losses.
