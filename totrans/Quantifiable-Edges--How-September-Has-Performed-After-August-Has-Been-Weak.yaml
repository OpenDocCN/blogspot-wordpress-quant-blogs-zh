    stock market. But with August performing so poorly I wondered how that might affect
    September’s performance. The SPX finished August down 4.7%. Below I conducted
    a study showing how September has performed following August returns worse than
    X%.

    into September on a bad note in the past has not alleviated any risk. The worse
    August was the worse September was. Below I’ve listed the 7 instances where, like
    now, August finished down over 4%.

    saw September swoons of over 8%. While not statistically significant, I do think
    this is worth considering.
