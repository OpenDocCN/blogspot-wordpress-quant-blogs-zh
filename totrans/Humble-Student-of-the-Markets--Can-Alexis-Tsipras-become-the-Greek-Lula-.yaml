    reforms could have a big impact. Contrary to its image in Europe, Greece has already
    made moves in this direction: between 2013 and 2014, it jumped a hundred and eleven
    places in the World Bank’s “ease of starting a business” index. And reform doesn’t
    mean Greece needs to abandon the things that make it distinctive. In fact, in
    the case of exports, the country has important assets that it hasn’t taken full
    advantage of. Greek olive oil is often described as the best in the world. Yet
    sixty per cent of Greek oil is sold in bulk to Italy, which then resells it at
    a hefty markup. Greece should be processing and selling that oil itself, and similar
    stories could be told about feta cheese and yogurt; a 2012 McKinsey study suggested
    that food products could add billions to Greece’s G.D.P. Similarly, tourism, though
    it already accounts for eighteen per cent of G.D.P., has a lot more potential.
    Most tourists in Greece are Greek themselves, a sign that the country could do
    a much better job of tapping the booming global tourism market. Doing so would
    require major investments in improving ports and airports, and in marketing. But
    the upside could be huge. Greece also needs to stem its current brain drain. It
    produces a large number of scientists and engineers, but it spends little on research
    and development, so talent migrates abroad. And there are other ways that Greece
    could capitalize on its climate and its educated workforce; as Galbraith suggests,
    it’s an ideal location for research centers and branches of foreign universities.'

    ordinary citizens, since the economy’s myriad rules and regulations serve mainly
    to protect the wealthy and those lucky enough to have won a sinecure. But that’s
