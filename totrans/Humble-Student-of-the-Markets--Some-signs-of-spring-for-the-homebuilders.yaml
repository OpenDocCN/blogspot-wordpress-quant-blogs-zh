    Though these signs do not mean that housing prices don’t overshoot on the downside,

- en: Kellner's views are confirmed by the market action of the homebuilders. The
    chart below shows the relative returns of the Homebuilder SPDRs compared to the
    S&P 500\. The Homebuilders have broken out of a relative downtrend relative to
    the market and they are now in a basing period. I would expect the group to stay
    in this trading range some time before breaking out on the upside.

    be another indicator the bull is ready for a sustainable run to the upside.
