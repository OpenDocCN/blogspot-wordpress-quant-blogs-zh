    I noted that the 2315 level for the NASDAQ Composite Index had figured prominently
    in several important gaps and served as a critical support and resistance level
    for the index going back to mid-January.'

    move up or down – these important support and resistance levels end up being revisited
    on a quite a few occasions and ultimately prove to be an important measuring stick
    for the strength of subsequent market action.

- en: Looking at the three month chart (with 60 minute bars) below, in the past two
    months the 2315 level has played an important role in two new gaps, one from the
    end of February and another at the beginning of April.  The end of February gap
    down served as a ceiling for price action for almost a month, while the April
    1^(st) gap up has been the floor for price movements over the course of the past
    two weeks.  Today’s sharp drop tested the gap and the corresponding 2315 level.  So
    far, that test of support has held.  As long as 2315 continues to hold, the markets
    should continue to consolidate and move up from current levels, but should 2315
    be breached – and the gap down to 2290 be closed – expect emboldened shorts and
    panicky longs to put the 2155 low back in to play.
