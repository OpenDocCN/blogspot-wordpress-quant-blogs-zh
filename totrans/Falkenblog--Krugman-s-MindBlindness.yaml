    have expected is that opponents would listen, even a bit, to what proponents were
    saying.

    listening! If they listened, they would hear the truth, come around to his way
    of thinking, and the world would be as Keynes envisaged in

    Milton Friedman either, as his career ascended almost step-by-step with an increase
    in the size of government and the amount of regulation. I don't think many legislators
    do what Noam Chomsky wants either (anarcho-socialism).

    economics, what happens to wages, profits, production, with lots of little examples.
    No socialist mentions these arguments or examples anymore because they are so
    blatantly irrelevant, and rather talk endlessly about alienation, or vague notions
    like philosophical materialism. Marx was wrong whenever he was specific (eg, the
    falling rate of profits, business cycles becoming broader across industries, the
    state whithering aways under communism), but as Marx wrote such obscure long twaddle,
    despots of all types could simply point to Marx as proving their side was the
    vanguard of history, and few debaters could on the spot know how to respond to
    the specious argument taken from Marx's

    to do, which is why for many decades Marx was considered the greatest intellectual
    in history (after the fall of the USSR, this now seems absurd, but that's hindsight).

    choose certain policies, rather, they help people rationalize their prejudices.
    Just break out of your intellectual echo chamber long enough to realize that emphatic
    reassertion is not argument, and if fiscal stimulus was the no-brainer you thought
    it was, it would have clearer empirical support.
