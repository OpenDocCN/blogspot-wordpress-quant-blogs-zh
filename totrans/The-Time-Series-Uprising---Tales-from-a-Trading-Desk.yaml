- en: Ben over on O’Reilly has an interesting [article](http://strata.oreilly.com/2013/04/the-re-emergence-of-time-series.html)
    on time-services databases.  Historically [OneTick](http://www.onetick.com/web1/onetick_accelerator.php)
    and [kdb](http://kx.com/kdb-plus-tick.php) have been the database’s of choice
    in financial services.

    at least move past v1.0, but doesn’t have a streaming API – something that kdb
    has.'

- en: Time [series](http://www.scidb.org/HTMLmanual/13.6/scidb_ug/ch01.html) and spatial
    grids may be represented in relations, but only at a severe cost in both space
    and processing time. SciDB will be organized around multidimensional array storage,
    a generalization of relational tables that can provide orders of magnitude better
    performance.

    web site, none are from the financial domain – either due to confidentiality,
    or because it doesn’t align with financial problems.

- en: TempoDB offer a list of customers already using the product.  REST appears to
    be the “API” of choice.  Curious to see TempoDB available on [Heroku](https://addons.heroku.com/tempodb). 
    Shame no sample visualization’s are [offered](https://www.tempo-db.com/features/#Visualization)
    😦

    offering flexible, time-based facts, supporting queries and joins, with elastic
    scalability, and ACID transactions.
