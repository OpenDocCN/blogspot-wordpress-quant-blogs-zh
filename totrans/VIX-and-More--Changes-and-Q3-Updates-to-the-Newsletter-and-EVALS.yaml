    and [EVALS](http://vixandmoreevals.blogspot.com/) (ETF Volatility Analysis Long/Short
    trading system) as a distant sideshow to the center stage occupied by the blog.
    That being said, potential subscribers have asked for at least quarterly updates
    which explain what it going on in the newsletter, discuss the [Stock of the Week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/stock%20of%20the%20week)
    (SOTW) and talk a little about the performance of the model portfolios and other
    issues of interest.
