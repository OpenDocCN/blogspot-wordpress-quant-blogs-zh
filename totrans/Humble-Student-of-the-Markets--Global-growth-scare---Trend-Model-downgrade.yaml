    the reasoning behind my downgrade were different from Goldman's. Even though the
    absolute level of the signal remains "risk-on", the weaknesses led to a directional
    change which amounted to a trading downgrade. As the chart below of real-time
    (not back-tested) past trading upgrades and downgrades show, they have had a reasonable
    track of signaling short-term stock market movements.

    Despite the better PMI releases coming out of China last week, commodity prices
    are weakening. The chart below of the CRB Index shows that commodity prices violated
    its 50 day moving average (dma) in early July and they are showing a general topping
    pattern. Longer term, however, the trend remains positive as the CRB Index is
    holding up above its 200 dma.
