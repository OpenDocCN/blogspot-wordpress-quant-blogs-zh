    the reasoning behind my downgrade were different from Goldman's. Even though the
    absolute level of the signal remains "risk-on", the weaknesses led to a directional
    change which amounted to a trading downgrade. As the chart below of real-time
    (not back-tested) past trading upgrades and downgrades show, they have had a reasonable
    track of signaling short-term stock market movements.
