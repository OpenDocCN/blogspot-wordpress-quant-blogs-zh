- en: I have received so many emails about my [Stock of the Week ‘Sequential Portfolio’](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/stock%20of%20the%20week)
    that I have decided to start discussing this subject on a regular basis on the
    [*VIX and More* Subscriber Newsletter Blog](http://vixandmoresubscriber.blogspot.com/).
    For the record, the subscriber blog is open to all readers and does not require
    a subscription to access. In fact the main purpose of the subscriber blog is to
    provide highlights and selected updates from the [subscriber newsletter](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/subscriber%20newsletter)
    for the benefit of the general public.

    the Week (SOTW) selections and how I track the results, as well as to provide
    an archived list of all the SOTW picks going back to the launch of the newsletter.

    subscriber blog at [Stock of the Week ‘Sequential Portfolio’ Up 466% Since 3/30/08
    Launch](http://vixandmoresubscriber.blogspot.com/2009/09/stock-of-week-sequential-portfolio-up.html).
