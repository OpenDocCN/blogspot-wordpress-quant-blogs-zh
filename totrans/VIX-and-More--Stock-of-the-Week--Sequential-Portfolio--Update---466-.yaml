    that I have decided to start discussing this subject on a regular basis on the
    [*VIX and More* Subscriber Newsletter Blog](http://vixandmoresubscriber.blogspot.com/).
    For the record, the subscriber blog is open to all readers and does not require
    a subscription to access. In fact the main purpose of the subscriber blog is to
    provide highlights and selected updates from the [subscriber newsletter](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/subscriber%20newsletter)
    for the benefit of the general public.
