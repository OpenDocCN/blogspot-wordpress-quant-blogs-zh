    The story of hedge fund investing has been to look for a pure alpha stream, however

    2% and 20% with a lockup. In the gaming business, the lockup remains. However,
    there are significant overhead cost to keep the lights on in a gaming operation.
    However an investor can gain some of the benefits of economies of scale if there
    are such a venture can achieve sufficient size.
