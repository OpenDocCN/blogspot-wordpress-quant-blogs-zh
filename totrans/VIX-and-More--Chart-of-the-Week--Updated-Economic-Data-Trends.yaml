    I was pleasantly surprised by the positive reception to my chart of how various
    components of economic activity have been tracking against expectations for 2010\.
    As a result, I expect to periodically update a version of this chart for the blog.

- en: This week’s [chart of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week)
    is one such update, selected partly because the last several weeks suggest a possible
    reversal in the negative trend of economic data relative to expectations for [employment](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/nonfarm%20payrolls)

    Income, Personal Spending, etc.)

    broken, there is at best marginal evidence to support the idea of a bullish uptrend
    in the data. Starting tomorrow with the [retail sales](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/retail%20sales)
    numbers, this week should go a long way toward answering some of the questions
    about what the data say about the state of economic activity in the United States.
