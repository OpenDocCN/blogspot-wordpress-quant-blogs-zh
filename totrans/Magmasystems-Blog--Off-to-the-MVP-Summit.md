See some of you at the Microsoft MVP Summit starting on Monday evening?

What's important to me is to see Microsoft's directions on Capital Markets. I would liek to see a cohensive story on:

- Grid computing (Windows CCS and possible synergies with Digipede)

- Quasi-realtime Analysis Services, with associated WPF visualizations

- Support for parallel constructs in C#/NET (Microsoft Research Accelerator for GPUs)

- Any forward movement for Complex Event Processing
