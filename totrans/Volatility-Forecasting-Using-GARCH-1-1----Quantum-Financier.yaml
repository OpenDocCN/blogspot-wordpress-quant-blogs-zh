    volatility. There is several ways to just that; this very topic is the subject
    of a lot of research in finance. Different models to model volatility are available
    and they range from both ends of the complexity spectrum. I am going to be using
    what I think is one of the most popular: the GARCH(1,1). Just as a side note however,
    I don’t think it is the best model to use, but I do think that the simplicity
    of it makes it very attractive. For the more sophisticated quant crowd, in the
    GARCH family, the EGARCH seems to better forecast market volatility than its counterparts.
    I will not go into to much detail on the GARCH process (ie this is not meant to
    be an introduction post), if you would like to hear more about it, please let
    me know in the comment section.'

    21 day standard deviation with the residuals at the bottom. Results have been
    created using the tseries and quantmod libraries for R.

    the conditional normality assumption does not seem to be violated (using Jarque
    Bera and Box-Ljung tests). Regardless of the textbook testing, eyeballing the
    chart, we see that the model is fairly good at predicting SPY’s volatility. Now
    that we have the model in place, the next post should be on how to use a similar
    model on volatility of volatility once it has been stripped of its correlation
    with the actual volatility to see if we can improve our trading results and especially
    our regime switching strategies.
