    brokerage back in December 2005, I was one of the first to sign on. The promise
    was an [inexpensive commission structure](http://www.tradeking.com/p/home/tradeking/about/commissionsfees.tmpl),
    some [innovative tools](http://www.tradeking.com/p/home/tradeking/tour/tools/tools.tmpl)
    and an emphasis on [integrating social media](http://community.tradeking.com/)
    themes into the online experience. In the almost four years since it was launched,
    TradeKing still differentiates their services along the original three themes
    and has made increasingly larger overtures to options traders, including a strong
    [educational](http://www.tradeking.com/p/home/tradeking/education/home.tmpl) component.

    automatically logs me off. As an active trader, unless I can leave my browser
    window open for a full trading session without having to worry about being timed
    out just before I want to make an important trade, then I am going to be an intermittent
    customer at best.

    but mouse-based. This is undoubtedly attractive for the security conscious trader,
    but not for those who wish to automate the login process and/or never be automatically
    logged off in the first place.

    be nice if customers could elect the level of security that is appropriate for
    their account.

    tomorrow morning. Still, the Options Scanner runs in real time and may be able
    to identify a high potential buy-write opportunity after the open.

    more TradeKing tools and graphics into the blog.

    for TradeKing. On the contrary, my intent is to rotate through some of the main
    options brokers (thinkorswim, optionsXpress, OptionsHouse and TradeMonster) in
    order to highlight what I consider to be some of the better features, etc. and
    give people a feel for some of what is available from each of these brokers. That
    being said, TradeKing does advertise on the blog from time to time, but so also
    do all the other brokers listed above, save thinkorswim.]'
