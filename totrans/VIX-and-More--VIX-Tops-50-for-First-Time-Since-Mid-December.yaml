    this morning, the VIX has [spiked](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20spikes)
    all the way to 51.03, up 17.9% so far today and up 32.3% from just six sessions
    ago.

- en: Since the large gap down at the open, today’s action has been more of a slow
    grind than a sharp panic, suggesting that there could be a fair distance still
    to the down side. SPX support may come in the 820-830 range, but if those levels
    fail to hold, the possibility of a drop back down to 740 suddenly looms large.
