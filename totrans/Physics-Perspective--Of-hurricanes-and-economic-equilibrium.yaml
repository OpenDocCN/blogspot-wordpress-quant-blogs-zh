    EMH displays its greatest power, as it makes specific predictions which generaly
    turn out to be true. In the case of the "anomaly" identified by Lo, for example,
    the EMH enthusiast would point out that this particular predictability has disappeared
    over the past 20 years just as the EMH would predict. By 1997, other researchers
    revisiting the phenomenon needed high frequency data even to find it at the level
    of minute-by-minute returns on the New York Stock Exchange. By 2005, when physicists
    Bence Toth and Janos Kertesz [looked at the effect again](http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0506071),
    they found it had completely vanished. Conclusion: not only is the EMH safe from
    the criticism, it''s a shining example of a theory which makes accurate predictions
    -- and as every economist knows, this is the sole measure by which to judge the
    value of a theory, as Milton Friedman argued in his famous 1966 essay [The Methodology

  zh: EMH捍卫者甚至可以声称，这种洞察力正是EMH展示其最大力量的地方，因为它做出了具体的预测，而这些预测通常被证明是正确的。例如，在Lo所识别的“异常”的情况下，EMH热情者会指出，这种特定的可预测性在过去20年中已经消失，正如EMH所预测的那样。到1997年，其他研究人员在重新研究这一现象时，甚至需要高频数据才能在纽约证券交易所的分钟回报水平上找到它。到2005年，当物理学家Bence
    Toth和Janos Kertesz[再次研究这种效应](http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0506071)时，他们发现它已经完全消失了。结论是：EMH不仅免受批评，而且是一个准确预测的典范——正如每一位经济学家所知，这是衡量理论价值的唯一标准，正如米尔顿·弗里德曼在他1966年著名的论文《正统经济学的
    methodology》中论证的那样。

- en: Suppose that some atmospheric theorists developed the Efficient Atmospheres
    Hypothesis (EAH) which asserts that planetary atmospheres in general -- and the
    Earth's, in particular -- are always in a state very close to equilibrium with
    the air resting in a calm state of repose. Given the total amount of air, its
    density and the force of gravity, the theorists have even been able to predict
    the air pressure at sea level and how it should fall off with altitude. The EAH
    works pretty well in explaining some of the most basic aspects of the atmosphere.
    But the theory also makes a more controversial claim -- that, in fact, the air
    pressure at any two places in the atmosphere (at the same altitude)  should always
    be identical, or at least very nearly the same. After all, the EAH theorists argue,
    if there were pressure differences, they would create winds carrying air and energy
    from the higher pressure zone toward the lower pressure zone. That flow of air
    would lower the pressure in the former place and raise it in the latter, eventually
    bringing those two pressures back into balance.

  zh: 设想一些大气理论家提出了一个有效大气假说（EAH），该假说认为，行星大气（尤其是地球大气）总是处于与静止的空气平衡非常接近的状态。考虑到空气的总量、密度和重力，这些理论家甚至能够预测海平面上的气压以及随高度降低的情况。EAH在解释大气的某些基本方面方面效果很好。但该理论还提出了一个更具争议性的主张——实际上，大气中任何两地的气压（在同一高度）应该总是相同的，或者至少非常接近。毕竟，EAH理论家认为，如果有压力差异，它们会创造风，将空气和能量从高压区带到低压区。这种空气流动会降低前者的压力，提高后者的压力，最终使这两个压力达到平衡。

- en: Now, critics of EAH might say this is crazy. After all, we observe winds all
    the time, and sometimes great storms. Just last week high winds from hurricane
    Irene caused massive flooding up and down the eastern US. Isn't this obvious disproof
    of the EAH? On the contrary, the EAH theorists might respond, these observations
    actually provide further evidence for the theory. OK, they concede, the atmosphere
    does sometimes depart a little from perfect equilibrium, but the hurricane is
    clear evidence of how normal economic forces drive the system back into equilibrium.
    After all, if you look at the data on the hurricane after it passed by the US,
    you'll see that the immense pressure differences within it were slowly eroded
    away as the hurricane dissipated energy through its winds. Eventually Irene petered
    out altogether as the atmosphere was restored to equilibrium. This is simply another
    victory for the EAH; indeed, it predicted just this ultimate fate for such a disturbance.

- en: In the setting of atmospheric physics, of course, no one would take the EAH
    seriously. It's obviously crazy to claim that the gradual disappearance of Irene
    was evidence for the "increasing efficiency" of the atmosphere, or (equivalently)
    for its return to the equilibrium state. Irene was one very much out-of-equilibrium
    disturbance, but it's disappearance says nothing about whether the atmosphere
    as a whole has become closer to equilibrium. As Irene disappeared, hundreds of
    other storms, and perhaps other proto-hurricanes, were being stirred up elsewhere
    on the planet. Storms are always fading away and others are always growing in
    the great chaotic maelstrom of the atmosphere, and all of this reflects its condition
    as a system driven out of equilibrium by energy from the Sun. To show that the
    atmosphere was actually moving closer to equilibrium over time would require some
    global study of storms and winds and air pressure differences to see if they were
    in some general sense progressively getting smaller. What happens to one storm
    is actually quite irrelevant.

  zh: 在气象物理学的背景下，当然，没有人会认真对待EAH。声称伊莲娜的逐渐消失是大气“效率增加”的证据，或（等效地）是大气回归平衡状态的证据，显然是疯狂的。伊莲娜是一个非常远离平衡的干扰，但它的消失并不能说明整个大气是否变得更接近平衡。当伊莲娜消失时，全球其他地方正在酝酿着数百场其他风暴，或许还有其他飓风前兆。风暴总是在消退，其他风暴总是在大气混乱的漩涡中增长，这一切都反映了它作为一个由太阳能量推动出平衡的系统状态。要证明大气实际上是在随时间变得更接近平衡，将需要对风暴、风和气压差异进行一些全球研究，以看看它们是否在某种一般意义上逐渐变小。一个风暴的命运实际上是非常无关紧要的。

    many arguments about market efficiency based on the EMH. In [a talk](http://ineteconomics.org/video/conference-kings/efficient-market-theory-jeremy-siegel)
    from several years ago, soon after the crisis, Jeremy Siegel of the University
    of Pennsylvania addressed the question of whether the crisis had shown the EMH
    to be false. The EMH asserts, of course, that markets work very efficiently to
    exploit the wisdom of crowds to funnel savings into investments giving the best
    long run returns (rather than, say, fueling a financial bubble based around mortgages
    bundled opaquely into crappy CDOs). But no, he asserted, the financial crisis
    hadn't shown anything to be wrong with the EMH, indeed it offered further evidence
    for the EMH because (I'm paraphrasing from memory) "everything that happened did
    so for sound economic reasons." In other words, when people finally understood
    the true nature of those CDOs, their values plummeted, just as the EMH would predict.
