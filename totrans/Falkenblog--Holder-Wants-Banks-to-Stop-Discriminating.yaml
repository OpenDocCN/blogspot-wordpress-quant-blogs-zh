    at Fannie Mae? How could any investor doubt loan criteria vetted by the historically
    low-risk Fannie Mae? They didn't. It didn't cause the crisis, but it was a leading
    cause.

    to see any large organization not in violation.

- en: As part of settlement deals, prosecutors have required banks to sign "nondisclosure
    agreements" barring them from talking about the methods used to allege discrimination.
    Bank lawyers contend the prosecutors are trying to hide the shaky legal grounds
    on which the cases are built. "It's horrible what they're doing at the civil rights
    division," said Reginald Brown, a partner at Wilmer Hale in Washington, who has
    represented banks in connection to recent race-bias investigations. "They don't
    have any proof, just theories."

    of any settlement with them, that you won't disclose what their theories were.
    That's because their theories are loopy and wouldn't stand the light of day."

    application outcomes is enough to prove racial discrimination — even if no intent
    exists on the part of loan officers to contrast based on the color of applicants,
    and even legitimate business factors — such as credit scores and down payments
    — help explain disparities in loan outcomes between white and black applicants.

    is, he said, bankers discriminate "with a smile" and "fine print." He said this
    kind of racism, though more subtle, is "every bit as destructive as the cross
    burned in a neighborhood."
