    pace of asset purchases should not be interpreted as the beginning of a predetermined
    course for raising the federal funds rate from its current level. Those participants
    stressed that the Committee's assessment regarding the appropriate timing of an
    increase in the target range for the federal funds rate was separate from its
    current deliberations on asset purchases and would be subject to the higher standard,
    as laid out in the Committee's outcome-based guidance on the federal funds rate.

    Average Inflation Targeting (FAIT) framework, it also depends on the Powell Fed's
    newfound focus on inequality and employment. How does the Fed define full employment?
    In particular, a comparison of the US prime-age employment to population (EPOP)
    to Canada's is a laboratory in monetary and government policies in light of the
    similarities in age (though not race) demographics. Canadian prime-age EPOP has
    been higher than the US in the last two expansion cycles and it recovered faster
    from the pandemic when compared to each country's respective 2019 peaks.
