- en: In this market, I find it hard to think of any stock as ‘running strong’ unless
    they are in the precious metals business, but strong can also be a relative term.

    interest – over the course of the past few weeks and months. Four which stand
    out from the past are the so-called [Four Horsemen of Technology](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/10/four-generals-will-tell-story.html):
    Research in Motion ([RIMM](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=rimm)); Amazon
    ([AMZN](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=amzn)); Google ([GOOG](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=goog));
    and Apple ([AAPL](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=aapl)).'

    earnings surprise, with the most recent surprise coming with Google yesterday
    afternoon. Had it not been for the Steve Jobs health issue, all four stocks would
    be crushing the S&P 500 index over the course of the past two months highlighted
    in the chart below. In fact, even with the Jobs issue, Apple is relatively even
    with the broad market index.

    in the next bull leg. My guess is that the next group of leaders will include
    one or more of these tech titans.
