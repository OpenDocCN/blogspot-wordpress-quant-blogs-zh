- en: You'd think that by now we'd have a pretty good empirical understanding of how
    economies grow, i.e. what the normal pattern of growth is through time. We've
    been studying economies for a couple of centuries, and have had reasonably good
    numbers of the (crude) measure of GDP for half a century. In economics -- and
    among the financial media generally -- it's almost beyond question that the normal
    pattern of economic growth is exponential growth. Indeed, almost no one ever supposes
    it might be different; we only debate how fast or slow recent exponential growth
    has been.

    18 mature economies from 1960 onwards. They find that the best fit to the data
    isn't exponential at all, but linear, suggesting that if growth was ever exponential
    (in young economies), it isn't  like that any more.

    a handful of (mostly) German economists have been pointing to this evidence for
    nearly twenty years.

    people themselves, cells, bacterial colonies, trees and anything else alive --
    turn out to have natural stages of growth, with fast growth eventually slowing
    toward something more gradual and, eventually, stopping altogether (which wouldn't
    imply the end of change, just some kind of balance). Current ideas in economics
    might need considerable re-thinking, of course.
