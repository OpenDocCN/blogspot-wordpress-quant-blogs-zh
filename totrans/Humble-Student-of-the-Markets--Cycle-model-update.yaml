    a reader noted that the chart that I showed spanned five years, which represented
    a bull market. As such the "buy" signals represented by the 20-week cycle was
    tested on a market that had an upward bias.

    lines represent supposed 21-week cycle bottoms. The blue arrows represent "good"
    buy signals, where the market was higher 4-6 weeks later; and the "red" arrows
    represent "bad" buy signals, where the market fell 4-6 weeks later.

    the devastating 2007-2009 bear market. What's more, this was able to identify
    short-term bottoms in the waterfall decline of 2008 and therefore these results
    make the 20-week signal intriguing as a timing tool.

    ultimate bottom in 2009 all together.

    been somewhat skeptical of the cycle approach to technical analysis, but this
    chart has changed my mind. My preliminary conclusion is that it may be useful
    and deserves a place in the toolkit of a technical analyst.
