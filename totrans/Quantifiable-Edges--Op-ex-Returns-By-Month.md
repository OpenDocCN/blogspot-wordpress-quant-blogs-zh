# Quantifiable Edges: Op-ex Returns By Month

> 来源：[http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2011/03/op-ex-returns-by-month.html#0001-01-01](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/2011/03/op-ex-returns-by-month.html#0001-01-01)

About a year ago I showed a table on the blog that broke down op-ex week by month. Op-ex week in general is normally pretty bullish. March, April, and December it has been especially so. S&P 500 options began trading in mid-1983\. The table below is an updated version of the one I produced last year. It goes back to 1984\. I excluded op-ex week of September 2001 due to the extreme (and horrific) circumstances.

While December has been more reliable, total gains have been the largest during March op-ex.
