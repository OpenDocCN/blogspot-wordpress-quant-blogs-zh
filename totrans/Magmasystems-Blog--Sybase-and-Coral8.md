# Magmasystems Blog: Sybase and Coral8

> 来源：[http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2009/03/sybase-and-coral8.html#0001-01-01](http://magmasystems.blogspot.com/2009/03/sybase-and-coral8.html#0001-01-01)

A very curious situation between

Sybase

RAP and Coral8.....

I ran into Ivy

Schmerken

the other day. She has been an editor and writer at Wall Street and Technology for over 20 years, and I used to read here articles when I started on Wall Street back in 1986.

She told me that she had just written an article on the new

Sybase

RAP "

CEP

" product, and asked me what I thought of it. I said, "I know all about it. They licensed the Coral8 engine, and that's how they are doing the

CEP

part of things." I thought it was public knowledge on Wall Street that

Sybase

RAP was using Coral8, but I guess that

Sybase

didn't think so, as they never disclosed this fact to Ivy in her interview.

Ivy followed up on this fact with the people from

Sybase

, and then it came out that

Sybase

was using Coral8 under the hood. Ivy's news story was then picked up by other news sources like

Finextra

, and all of a sudden, it was out that

Sybase

was using Coral8.

This prompted an interesting

[post](http://blog.aleri.com/aleri-coral8-engine-everywhere/2009/03/17/)

from John

Morrell

of

Coraleri

that was posted on the

Coraleri

blog.

I am frankly puzzled why

Sybase

did not disclose the Coral8 partnership up front. Surely they realize that most of Wall Street (at least the people who care about

CEP

) knew about the partnership. I was told about this by

Sybase

themselves. Wombat used Coral8 under the hood in their Acumen product, and in fact, it was Wombat's strong endorsement of Coral8 that helped us in our choice of

CEP

engines.

I would have thought that it would be to

Sybase's

benefit that they tout the fact that a tried and tested

CEP

engine was at the heart of their new offering. Can anyone shed some insight on the thought process here?
