- en: 'of a "Wheel of Fortune" puzzle ever, a Manhattan editor Caitlin Burke nailed
    a staggeringly long answer with just one letter for a clue. The show has you spin
    a wheel that generates prizes for each letter guessed, and usually you wait until
    the phrase is mostly done, such as "Risky Stocks are Crappy Passive In-estments".
    But when she was staring at the highly ambiguous 27-letter phrase "-''-- --- -
    ---- ---L--- ----- ----", she risked her chance at winning by guessing: "I''ve
    Got a Good Feeling About This". She won a Caribbean vacation worth about $6,500
    with that guess. She finished the game with a total of $53,618.'

    Learning about how she did it is interesting. First, she played the game at home
    a lot with her family, and was relatively good at it. This is also evidenced by
    her total winnings, which show she did not merely get lucky. Second, she identified
    the "-'--" as "I've", because that is the most common three letter contraction
    that starts a sentence. Lastly, her ringtone for her boyfriend is "I've got a
    Feeling" by the Black Eyed Peas, so a close phrase was in her short term memory.
    Put that all together, and her guess seems reasonable, without that information,
    it seems like magic.

    of many models--Black-Scholes, special relativity, the law of gravitation--you'll
    find similar properties. What seems like magic is a pretty straightforward synthesis
    of some well-known information, applied by someone who is smart but not superhuman.
