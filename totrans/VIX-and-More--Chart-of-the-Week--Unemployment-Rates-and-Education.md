# VIX and More: Chart of the Week: Unemployment Rates and Education

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/11/chart-of-week-unemployment-rates-and.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/11/chart-of-week-unemployment-rates-and.html#0001-01-01)

While I have a bias in favor of using home grown charts for my [chart of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week), this week one chart in particular stuck in my head, the chart below from [EconomPic Data](http://econompicdata.blogspot.com/) that compares recent changes in the relative level of unemployment to the overall [unemployment rate](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/unemployment%20rate).

It may take a moment for readers to get their bearings on this graph, but in essence it shows that one’s level of education has increasingly become a factor in the likelihood of being unemployed. A decade or so ago, the unemployment rate for someone with less than a high school degree (dark blue line) was about 2% higher than the average for the population, while the unemployment rate for those with a bachelor’s degree or higher was about 2% lower than the average for all workers. By 2009, the gap had tripled to the point that less than a high school degree translated into a 6% higher unemployment rate and at the same time a bachelor’s degree or higher now meant about a 6% lower unemployment rate.

Not surprisingly, data shows that educational levels are highly correlated to income levels and rates of unemployment. While these facts should not come as a surprise to anyone, they certainly explain some of the recent income inequality data and should also have interesting political, social and other repercussions going forward.
