# VIX and More: VXX Is Trading; No Sign of VXY Yet

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/01/vxx-is-trading-no-sign-of-vxy-yet.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/01/vxx-is-trading-no-sign-of-vxy-yet.html#0001-01-01)

Of the two new [VIX ETNs](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20ETN), I see that [VXX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXX) is trading this morning, but I have not seen any activity in [VXY](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXY), perhaps because it is not yet trading. [Edit: a commenter noted that the correct ticker for the 5 month VIX ETN is [VXZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXZ), not VXY]

VXX opened at 100.11 and is currently trading at 101.49.

Some brokers are picking up the VXX ticker today and some appear to not yet have it in their system. The graphic below is from optionsXpress. The [NYSE](http://www.nyse.com/about/listed/lcddata.html?ticker=VXX) and [Yahoo Finance](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=VXX) are among those web sites that already have VXX information available.
