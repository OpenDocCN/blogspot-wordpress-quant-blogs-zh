- en: attending a college with higher SAT scores clearly lowered the wages of women

- en: the finding that the average SAT score of the highest ranked school that rejected
    a student is a much stronger predictor of that student’s subsequent earnings than
    the average SAT score of the school the student actually attended should give
    pause to those who interpret conventional regression-based estimates of the effect
    of college characteristics as causal effects of the colleges themselves. ..
