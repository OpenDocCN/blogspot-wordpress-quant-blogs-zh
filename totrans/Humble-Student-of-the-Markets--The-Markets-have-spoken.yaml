    effective again. ***Stock prices rose and long-term interest rates fell when investors
    began to anticipate the most recent action.*** Easier financial conditions will
    promote economic growth. For example, lower mortgage rates will make housing more
    affordable and allow more homeowners to refinance. Lower corporate bond rates
    will encourage investment. And ***higher stock prices will boost consumer wealth
    and help increase confidence***, which can also spur spending. Increased spending
    will lead to higher incomes and profits that, in a virtuous circle, will further
    support economic expansion.
