    newest wonder material is graphene, made of two-dimensional sheets of carbon just
    one atom thick. The 2010 Nobel Prize in physics was awarded for its discovery.

    in a very easy one-step process from ordinary coal. A quantum dot is like an artificial
    atom, and can be engineered to absorb/emit light at precise frequencies. Isn''t
    it ironic that the cheap stuff we''re burning all over the globe just for crude
    energy may be a great source for one of the most amazing materials we''ve ever
    discovered? Here''s the abstract of the paper:'

- en: Coal is the most abundant and readily combustible energy resource being used
    worldwide. However, its structural characteristic creates a perception that coal
    is only useful for producing energy via burning. Here we report a facile approach
    to synthesize tunable graphene quantum dots from various types of coal, and establish
    that the unique coal structure has an advantage over pure *sp*²-carbon allotropes
    for producing quantum dots. The crystalline within the coal structure is easier
    to oxidatively displace than when pure *sp*²-carbon structures are used, resulting
    in nanometre-sized graphene quantum dots with amorphous addends on the edges.
    The synthesized graphene quantum dots, produced in up to 20% isolated yield from
    coal, are soluble and fluorescent in aqueous solution, providing promise for applications
    in areas such as bioimaging, biomedicine, photovoltaics and optoelectronics, in
    addition to being inexpensive additives for structural composites.
