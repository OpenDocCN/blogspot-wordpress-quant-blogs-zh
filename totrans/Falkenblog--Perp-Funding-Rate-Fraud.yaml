- en: Supposedly, perp funding rates enable a futures/swap market to equilibrate at
    a spot price without delivery, so the market is a perpetual swap, hereafter denoted
    as a 'perp.' This mechanism is superficially like the basis in futures markets
    but ultimately profoundly different in theory and practice. The fact people are
    satisfied with this flawed but plausible feedback control system story implies
    some necessary detail is involved to see why it does not work. The basic disconnect
    is that the best predictor of the funding rate is not the current perp/spot price
    ratio but a moving average of the funding rate. Yet, if that is so, why is the
    perp/spot ratio purportedly defining the funding rate that is equilibrating the
    market?

- en: As a practical matter, the perp premium does not equilibrate supply and demand
    on perp markets; the spot price is sufficient for that job. The primary reason
    perp markets track spot markets can be explained as a [Schelling point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_point_(game_theory))
    or [correlated equilibrium](http://www.millenniumpost.in/sundaypost/beacon/the-ace-game-theorists-453467).
    The perp premium does not determine the funding rate but is determined by a funding
    rate decision made by insider market makers specific to each exchange. The exchange
    controls these insiders to various degrees in general. As tens of billions of
    dollars are currently outstanding on Defi perp exchanges and multiples more on
    centralized exchanges, the economic significance of this charade is immense, even
    if your typical perp trader seems blissfully indifferent.

    spot via a funding rate mechanism. When the perpetual contract's price exceeds
    the spot price, the standard story is that this implies more long than short demand.
    To equilibrate the market, the long traders pay short traders a fee proportional
    to this price premium. Crypto funding rates prevent continuing divergence in the
    price of both markets. The funding rate at BitMex is applied every 8 hours to
    every position that is active at that time. The 8-hour window is now a convention
    for quoting, though today's funding rate applications are sometimes hourly or

    (1965)](https://investmenttheory.org/uploads/3/4/8/2/34825752/paulsamuelson-proof.pdf)
    proved that if you know demand will be higher tomorrow, that gets reflected in
    the price today, not in future or expected spot prices. This reasoning is the
    basis for the random walk assumption, which is an excellent general first-order
    approximation to any asset price time series despite its criticisms. Nonetheless,
    one must admit the special case for crypto: there are unprecedented regulatory
    restrictions on owning or leveraging crypto. Thus, it is possible that in bull
    markets like late 2017 and early 2021, the extra demand constrained by regulators
    pushed up the leveraged perp price, and longs were willing to pay a funding rate
    for access they could not get anywhere else.'

    costs, dividends and option value are irrelevant for crypto. The risk premium
    would only imply a negative funding rate, as the only demographic with a natural
    position to hedge are those long, such as miners or dapps that need crypto to
    function. US interest rates are a couple of percentage points, but it is not obvious
    that stablecoins should be assumed to have this interest rate, in that you cannot
    directly buy a US Treasury with a stablecoin. That leaves the sentiment theory,

    long gold compare the cost of paying storage and interest on a long position vs.
    the funding rate; those short gold futures take delivery if they feel the funding

    If the market price closed at 100.00, and the funding rate was determined to be

    the past several years, that is a significant funding rate. Yet 0.03% is below
    the precision of any estimate of 'true value,' or a transaction cost. The average
    transaction costs for the most liquid US equities, which are more efficient than
    any crypto market, are estimated at least 0.1% (see [here](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3229719)).
    It is unlikely crypto prices have lower transaction costs, especially given explicit
    fees start at around 0.1%. Gemini trade data show a 0.15% standard deviation in
    the price from one trade to the next. A one-way trading fee of 0.2% means the
    price must deviate by at least 0.2% from its ‘true’ price before an arb would
    transact, giving the perp market price a 0.2% zone of indeterminably. Yet, with
    all this uncertainty, we expect the market to determine the funding rate with
    precision orders of magnitude more precise than these limits.

  zh: 在加密永续合约中，模态每日资金费率和永续合约溢价为 0.03%，年化为高达 11%。考虑到过去几年利率几乎为零，这是一个显著的资金费率。然而，0.03%
    低于任何“真实价值”的估计或交易成本的精度。对于最流动的美国股票，其平均交易成本至少为 0.1%（参见 [这里](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3229719)）。鉴于明确的费用起点约为
    0.1%，加密价格不太可能具有更低的交易成本。Gemini 的交易数据显示，从一次交易到下一次的价格标准偏差为 0.15%。一种单向交易费用为 0.2%，这意味着价格必须偏离其“真实”价格至少
    0.2% 才能进行套利交易，这使得永续期货市场价格具有 0.2% 的不确定性区间。然而，尽管存在所有这些不确定性，我们预期市场将以比这些限制精度更高几个数量级的精度确定资金费率。

    always reflects both the basis and the spot price. However, as the perp premium
    is applied continuously, its magnitude is irrelevant to any trading decision.
    Consider the perp trader who sees the perp price at a 0.0685% premium to the spot,
    implying a rich 25% funding rate for the short. The problem is not only that such
    a premium is below the asset price Plank length, but also that the perp premium
    at the time of her trade does not determine the funding rate she will receive.
    Instead, this premium is the average over the time she holds her position. Given
    the next tick will move the perp price by 0.1%, a 0.06% current perp premium has
    little forward-looking value. Perp premiums implying insanely large funding rates
    are insufficient for motivating initiating a position because the information
    content of a current perp premium is so low (especially compared to a simple moving
    average of past funding rates).

    0.0685%，意味着卖空者有 25% 的高资金费率。问题不仅在于这种溢价低于资产价格普朗克长度，还在于她交易时的永续合约溢价并不确定她将获得的资金费率。相反，这个溢价是她持有头寸的时间的平均值。鉴于下一个跳跃会使永续合约价格上涨
    0.1%，当前永续合约溢价 0.06% 具有较低的前瞻价值。暗示着极端大资金费率的永续合约溢价不足以激励开立头寸，因为当前永续合约溢价的信息内容很低（特别是与过去资金费率的简单移动平均相比）。
- en: Arbitrage is much simpler in deliverable futures markets. A futures trader locks
    in a cumulative funding rate at the time of a trade. The funding rate implied
    from the basis of a future is a cumulative rate over many days, generating a target
    return above transaction costs. Monthly or quarterly delivery implying a 11% annualized
    funding rate will show up as a hefty 1% or 3% premium to the spot price, not a
    0.03% premium. Given identical daily funding rates, true arbitrage, profits without

    value. Linking the perp and spot price (aka the ‘mark’ price and the ‘index’ price)
    to get a premium will depend on several unmentioned rules. Given each trade tick
    bounces around by 0.15%, any perp premium they generate given these degrees of
    freedom will have a standard error of at least 0.05%, giving them the freedom

    book or high-speed access unavailable to retail traders. In general, we should
    expect crypto perp market makers to be net flat but short perps because it is
    much easier to be long outside your perp market than to be short. For example,
    if Binance's market markets were net long perps, they would have to trust another
    exchange like FTX for their short positions, and regulators would then have a
    choke point along the route such a position is maintained. In contrast, if Binance
    market makers were short perps, they could just own crypto on the blockchain and
    be hedged. The net result would be that in addition to standard market maker profitability
    from the spread and fees, they get an additional 10% funding rate from their natural
    short perp position within their riskless crypto position. It’s ridiculous that
    customers accept this as the status quo default funding rate.

    arbitrage, and the law of iterated expectations, imply current sentiment is reflected
