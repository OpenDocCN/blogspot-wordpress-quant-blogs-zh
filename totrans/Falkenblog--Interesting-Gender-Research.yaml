    are the ones with the widest range of options, and therefore that their behavior
    more closely reflects each sex's actual preferences. The corollary is that because
    less attractive individuals have fewer options, they are under more pressure to
    compromise and thus their behavior more closely matches the opposite sex's preferences.

    better-looking a woman, the fewer. Good-looking men are more likely to have had
    sex soon after meeting a partner; good-looking women, less likely. Good-looking
    women are likelier to describe their relationships as "committed"; good-looking
    men, less likely.

- en: Very physically attractive women are more likely to form exclusive relationships
    than to form purely sexual relationships; they are also less likely to have sexual
    intercourse within the ﬁrst week of meeting a partner. Presumably, this difference
    arises because more physically attractive women use their greater power in the
    partner market to control outcomes within their relationships. For women, the
    number of sexual partners decreases with increasing physical attractiveness, whereas
    for men, the number of sexual partners increases with increasing physical attractiveness.

    It's interesting to consider why high status academics recommend such behavior.
