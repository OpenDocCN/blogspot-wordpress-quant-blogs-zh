- en: It seems that, lately, every blog posting I make on CEP generates further blog
    postings from the vendors and the subject-matter experts in the CEP space. It's
    great to see the CEP blogs become more active, so that I can tap into the collective
    wisdom of people like Tim, Marco, Mark, etc.

    Goldman, Lehman, Merrill, etc who wonder about the same things that I do? Or,
    do these people mainly purchase the pre-packaged algo trading packages that the
    vendors have to offer.

- en: One thing that was very interesting was the copy of the Aite Group report on
    Complex Event Processing that somebody had forwarded to me. It seems that most
    of the CEP companies number their customers in the dozens, rather than the hundreds
    or thousands. It seems that we are either at the very beginning of the explosive
    group that Aite predicts, or not many companies are finding a use for CEP, relying
    instead on their legacy apps to deal with streaming events. Certainly, in my own
    company, we have hand-written code for the various algo and HFT trading systems,
    code that I am sure the developers have profiled the hell out of in order to get
    the max performance. We would be hard pressed to replace this code with a generic
    CEP system.
