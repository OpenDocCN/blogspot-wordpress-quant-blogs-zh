    what intend to explore.

- en: I come from a comp sci / physics background, getting my first exposure to computers
    back in 1979 as a kid when I took a course at a college with a program for gifted
    youth. I was hooked from that point on. I went on to specialize in parallel processing
    and algorithms, which landed me my first job doing applied parallel processing
    research on Wall Street in the early 90’s.

    developer, architect, etc. in NY, Tokyo, and London. In the 80s and early 90s,
    technology was just becoming indispensable to the trading desks, and so there
    was plenty to do, plenty of technology to invent as we went along.

    new technologies (parallel processing, visualization), quantitative libraries
    (for pricing derivatives), etc. That was all fun until it became a commodity and
    the business of IT on Wall Street started changing, bringing in a wider variety
    of programmers (basically the full bell curve rather than the tail) and associated
    management structure.

    of electronic execution platforms for anything but the equities market (and I
    was focused on Fixed Income and FX).

    back in 2004 to focus on automated trading strategies. And so begins my blog …
