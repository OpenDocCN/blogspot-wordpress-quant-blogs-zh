    prices seems to focus primarily on energy and metals, with agricultural commodities
    often overlooked, at least in the United States.

    is intended to underscore the inflationary trend in agricultural commodities and
    ‘softs’ (which generally refer to sugar, coffee and cocoa) as reflected in the
    United Nations World Food Price Index. As the chart below shows, world food prices
    hit a new high in December, after jumping more than 54% from a February 2009 low.
    The new high in the index eclipses the old high from June 2008.

    which is up 51% in just four months and is up a staggering 239% over the course
    of the past two years to a new all-time high. Meat prices are also at new highs,
    but while the sugar price index currently stands at 398.4, meat has only risen
    to 142.2\. Note that all index values reflect a baseline of 100 that is derived
    from the 2002-2004 average prices.

- en: Commodities prices have both economic and political implications. The economic
    implications are particularly severe for emerging markets in which food costs
    represent a disproportionately high percentage of the typical household budget.
    Here the incremental increase in food prices can have a disastrous impact on the
    family cost structure. There are also some countries where the possibility of
    food riots and related civil unrest has the potential to destabilize those who
    are in power and in some cases perhaps even thrust the political system into chaos.

- en: So far rising food prices have triggered only a mild backlash here and there,
    but should prices continue to rise at the current rate of more than 20% per year,
    it is not possible to rule out catastrophic consequences across the globe.
