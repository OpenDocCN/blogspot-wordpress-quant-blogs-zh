    and earnings (courtesy of a big [SAP](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/SAP)
    earnings miss) caused the VIX to jump 17.8% today.  How much of that was related
    to the election?  Well…the 9-day [VIX9D](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX9D)
    spiked 47.8% today, now that the election is within the 9-day measurement window
    for the first time.  The bottom line is that election uncertainty and anticipated
    volatility is currently a huge factor in the mindset of the investor.

    and what happens after the election.  If you know anything about what happens
    to the VIX around [FOMC announcement days](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Fed%20Days),
    you will find considerable similarities when it comes to elections.  Specifically,
    the VIX responds to the upcoming [event risk](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/event%20volatility)
    by increasing steadily into the event, dropping sharply on the day of the event
    and declining even more as the event recedes in the rear-view mirror.

    all elections are unique in their own way and yet the same general principles
    apply.

    with the exception of 2008, which just happened to fall at the height of the Great
    Recession, so the 2008 data is excluded, as it would otherwise skew the results.
