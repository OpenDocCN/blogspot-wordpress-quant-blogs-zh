- en: Just finished reading Jonathan Knee’s [The Accidental Investment Banker](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Accidental-Investment-Banker-Inside-Transformed/dp/0812978048).
    He tells the story of his M&A career at Goldman’s and Morgan Stanley. There’s
    a good mix of industry history, explanation of M&A, and amusing anecdote. Several
    newsworthy principals figure, including John Thain. Since I’ve spent my banking
    career working on FI & FX systems I learned a lot about the M&A and IPO businesses.
    Recommended.
