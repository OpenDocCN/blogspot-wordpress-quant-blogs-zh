    who say that since the Advance-Decline line continues to make new highs, the bull
    remains alive and stock prices are likely to continue to grind higher.

    of breadth deterioration before corrections. In particular, the A-D Line gave
    no warning in the correction of 2011\. It did move sideways while the SPX rise
    in the first correction of 2012, but gave no warning in the second correction
    of 2012.

- en: Here is another way of thinking about breadth. Since breadth is designed to
    measure whether the generals (large caps) are leading the market or if the troops
    (broader market) are leading the market, then the easy way is to analyze the relative
    performance of an equal-weighted index against the cap-weighted index. If the
    equal-weighted index is outperforming and the market is rising, then the troops
    are leading the charge, which is bullish. On the other hand, if the cap weighted
    index is outperforming, then it is a sign of narrowing leadership, which can be
    a warning sign of deteriorating breadth.

    cap weighted SPX (shown in purple). In the period leading up to the corrections
    of 2011 and 2012, the shaded areas show periods when the equal vs. cap weighted
    ratios deteriorated before the actual correction. The lead times lasted anywhere
    from four weeks to nine weeks. To be sure, this measure of breadth did not warn
    of trouble during the second corrective period of 2012 - in fact, it was rising.

    Should it be construed as a warning?

- en: Now consider this chart of the equal vs. cap weighted NASDAQ 100\. The pattern
    was the same as the equal vs. cap weighted SPX chart. We saw the same kind of
    breadth deterioration in 2011 and 2012 just before market weakness set in. Now
    even as the NDX is rallying, this breadth indicator is falling - a negative divergence.

    are flashing warning signals. Don`t say that you were not warned.
