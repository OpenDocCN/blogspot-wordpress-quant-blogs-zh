    past few days to the effect that right now is an excellent time to initiate new
    long positions on VIX options. I am still not sure what is behind most of this
    thinking, but it seems as if quite a few investors are excited about the VIX breakout,
    some have adopted a Roubiniesque pervasive pessimism and others clearly are still
    operating under the shadow of the 2008 volatility spikes.

    of 50% is a good time to get long the VIX, my response is that your ship has already
    sailed.

    solar stock](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/04/chinese-solar-stocks-on-rise.html),
    a rising VIX seems to be attracting the momentum crowd. Betting that a 50% rise
    in the VIX is just the beginning of a larger move is a sucker’s bet. In the event
    that readers find the data in the two studies linked at the bottom of this post
    not to be sufficiently compelling, I have added a new study that looks at what
    happens to the VIX following the first time it spikes high enough to close above
    30\. Not surprisingly, it is yet another example of [mean reversion](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/mean%20reversion)
    at work.

    an initial close above 30\. Of the 51 instances the VIX closed above 30 without
    having closed above 30 in the previous session, 18 times the VIX closed below
    30 on the next day and an additional 12 instances reflect the VIX closing below
    30 two days hence. This means that 59% of the time the VIX has surrendered the
    full distance of the close above 30 as well as some additional territory in just
    two days. Looking out four days, the VIX has already closed below 30 some 75%
    of the time, as is shown by the dotted red line.

    days later, the remaining 15.7% of the instances can make or break a trader. Six
    times (11.8%) the VIX has remained above the 30 level for at least 23 consecutive
    days following the first close above 30\. This is slightly more than one full
    options cycle. Prior to October 2008, traders who were short VIX calls could reasonably
    expect that the VIX was not going to spike any higher than 45, which was the [all-time
    record in the VIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/09/top-five-vix-spikes.html)
    at that time. Now that we have had front row seats to witness the VIX spike above
    80 on two separate occasions, I suspect investors overestimate the likelihood
    of a VIX spike of this magnitude happening again. Short of another acute systemic
    threat, I would be quite surprised to see the VIX rising over the 45 level.

    such as [bear call spreads](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/bear%20call%20spread)
    on the VIX. Long positions in VIX calls are not just low probability plays, but
    they are very expensive as well. I don’t mind, however, if speculators are eager
    to gobble these up, as I am glad to have a ready audience to buy some VIX calls.
