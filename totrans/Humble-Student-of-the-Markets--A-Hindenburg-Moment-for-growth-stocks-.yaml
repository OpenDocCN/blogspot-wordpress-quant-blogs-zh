    growth stocks. Worries came to a head when the Semiconductors Index rallied through
    and reversed though an upward trending relative performance channel, indicating
    a possible blow-off top. Beneath the hood, however, market internals are signaling
    breadth deterioration for NASDAQ stocks that warn of an impending corrective downdraft.

    Miekka to spot major market tops, though it purportedly only has many false positives
    and a success rate of 25%. The indicator looks for the combination of an increasingly
    bifurcated market, as measured by breadth divergences, and a downside momentum
    break from an uptrend.
