## Electronic trading job market

### January 29, 2008

[Mostly reports the death of electronic trading](http://mostly.wordpress.com/2008/01/26/etrading-is-dead/). Interesting follow up comments. The names mentioned as laid off are ecommerce/esales people. I know I’m hiring, but then I’m etrading software development, not marketing and sales. However, in my current hiring round I am seeing CVs from front office developers laid off in November and December 2007\. But I haven’t yet seen a CV from a rates etrading developer made redundant.
