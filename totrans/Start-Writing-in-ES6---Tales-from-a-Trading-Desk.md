## Start Writing in ES6

Good advice [from](https://www.airpair.com/angularjs/posts/preparing-for-the-future-of-angularjs) “Preparing for the future of AngularJS”, even if you have no interest in [Angular](http://blog.mgechev.com/2015/04/06/angular2-first-impressions/) 2.0\.  My current transpiler of choice is [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for no reason other than a colleague recommended it.  There are others, so [choose](https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler) and [play](http://es6-features.org/#GeneratorFunctionIteratorProtocol).

As more of an FYI, Babel also has experimental [support](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/experimental/) for ES7 proposals.
