    library for quantitative finance. In this post, I’m going to show you how to start
    using QuantLib in your own programs.  I won’t assume any specialized financial
    knowledge.  I do expect, however, that you know C++ and are at least familiar
    with some of the more common Boost C++ library components, such as shared pointers.
     Also, I’ve chosen to structure my code examples as Boost unit test cases rather
    than individual test programs. See the Boost Test Library at [http://www.boost.org](http://www.boost.org)
    for more information.

    value of money’ so that’s where we will begin as well.  The concept of the ‘time
    value of money’ alludes to the fact that money is worth more now than it will
    be in the future.  If a person is to be deprived of the utility of his money now,
    in the present, the borrower must compensate him until the loan is repaid, in
    the future.  This leads to several important and closely related concepts, the
    ‘future value’ of money, the ‘present value’ of money and interest rates.

- en: 'Taken in the context of what we’ve just learned about the time value of money,
    the interest rate is the compensation earned by the lender on the amount of money
    loaned, called the principal.  The principal plus the interest payment due at
    the maturity of the loan is the future value of the loan. Conversely, subtract
    the interest on the loan from the loan repayment to arrive at the loan’s present
    value, which in the case of a loan, is the same as the principal.  In simple mathematical
    terms where FV = Future Value, PV = Present Value, R = interest rate, and P =
    principal:'

- en: Calculating and manipulating present values, future values and rates of interest
    turns out to be fundamental to much of the field of finance and financial mathematics.
     So let’s see how QuantLib can be applied to these concepts. Take a look at the
    code below. It shows how to calculate the forward value of a loan, the amount
    due when the loan matures.
