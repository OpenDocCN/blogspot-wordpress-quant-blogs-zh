    much as long as you owned the property. When you sell it, it resets. While the
    hope was this would help little old ladies from getting pushed out of their houses,
    and keep government spending in check, the net result is that with inflation you
    now have many places where people are living in million dollar homes and paying
    taxes as if it were only a $100 home. Looking at it differently, they are spending
    10x as much as their neighbor on taxes.

  zh: 第13提案于1978年颁布的一项州法，规定只要你拥有某个物业，就不会让财产税上涨。当你出售它，税收将重新计算。希望是帮助老太太们不要被赶出房子，并控制政府开支，但最终结果是，由于通货膨胀，现在有许多地方的居民居住在百万美元的房屋中，但只需缴纳一百美元的税款。换个角度看，他们的税收要比邻居高10倍。

    to implement constraints on spending, and now it's a mess because it creates a
    very powerful lock-in effect on current property owners. But it has little to
    do with California's downward spiral, a state that used to be the most educated,
    prosperous, and beautiful place on the planet, is now near the bottom of state
    achievement, and their public places (airports, beach bathrooms) are poorly maintained,
