    much as long as you owned the property. When you sell it, it resets. While the
    hope was this would help little old ladies from getting pushed out of their houses,
    and keep government spending in check, the net result is that with inflation you
    now have many places where people are living in million dollar homes and paying
    taxes as if it were only a $100 home. Looking at it differently, they are spending
    10x as much as their neighbor on taxes.

    care enough to spend government money on them. That point was made yesterday by

    which at the time in California was very good, because the cuts that would come
    to education through the good graces of Proposition 13 had not yet trickled down
    to affect me.

    to implement constraints on spending, and now it's a mess because it creates a
    very powerful lock-in effect on current property owners. But it has little to
    do with California's downward spiral, a state that used to be the most educated,
    prosperous, and beautiful place on the planet, is now near the bottom of state
    achievement, and their public places (airports, beach bathrooms) are poorly maintained,
    like the bankrupt state they are.
