- en: '![](img/5832035228cc124597439153d312f70b.png)A number of readers have wondered
    whether the recent lack of volatility in the VIX in the face of a strong market
    downturn indicates that the VIX is losing some of its relevance.  This is a fair
    question.'

- en: As the graphic to the right indicates, not only is the implied volatility and
    historical volatility of the VIX currently hovering near 52 week lows – when clearly
    investor fear is not similarly lax – but since about mid-November or thereabouts,
    the volume of VIX options traded has dropped dramatically as well.  In fact, with
    the benefit of hindsight, it appears that the popularity of VIX options surged
    from May through November of 2007, only to have recently returned to the levels
    that preceded the anxiety over the subprime problems and all the dominoes since
    uncovered that appear to have been within tipping range.

    starts dropping below historical levels, it is possible that we may have a situation
    in which, as [I described previously](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2008/01/volatility-rip.html),
    the less the VIX moves, the less valuable (reliable) it becomes as a highly leveraged
    hedge against long market positions.

- en: One of the theories about the lack of action in the VIX is that those who are
    looking for another way to have a highly leveraged hedge have flocked to the inverse
    and double inverse ETFs.  Did anything happen in November that might support that
    theory?  Well, lo and behold, it turns out that the most popular of the double
    inverse ETFs, the [QID](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/QID), just
    happened to start trading options in November.  Coincidence?  I suspect not.  While
    the volume of QID options relative to VIX options is rather small, clearly the
    game has changed.

    but don’t be surprised if you see me posting about the QID more often.  After
    all, as the chart on the bottom shows, QID volume (and on balance volume) has
    demonstrated considerable predictive potential over the past year.
