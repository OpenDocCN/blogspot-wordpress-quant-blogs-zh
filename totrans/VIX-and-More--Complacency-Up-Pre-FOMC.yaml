    but here the indicator adds a little color to the story.

- en: The [VIX:SDS ratio](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%3ASDS) is
    something I [introduced last August](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/08/fear-vs-volatility.html).  In
    essence, it plots the VIX against the 2x inverse ETF of the SPX to help determine
    to what extent the VIX is just moving in the opposite direction of the SPX and
    to what extent there is an emotional component – either fear or complacency –
    in addition to the normal negative correlation.

    since September, but has been drifting steadily lower since the markets bottomed
    in March.  More importantly, the current VIX:SDS ratio is also approaching levels
    not sustained since July, when the credit crisis had not yet begun to unfold.  Also
    of interest is the 0.05 differential between the 10 day and 100 day simple moving
    averages, reflecting that current levels of complacency are the highest in relative
    terms since the launch of the SDS ETF in July 2006.

    caution.
