    followed by a decline of at least 20%. I identified two indicators that I found
    especially useful in determining when conditions may be ripe for a possible top.
    I recently updated the QE Study of Tops, and received a lot of positive feedback
    on it. A primary reason that I was inspired to update the study is that one of
    the indicators is currently flashing a warning sign. So I decided I would also
    make the study available to non-subscribers for a small fee.

    it and don't feel it was worth the $5.99, then simply send me a note explaining
    why (relatively nicely), and I will refund your money.
