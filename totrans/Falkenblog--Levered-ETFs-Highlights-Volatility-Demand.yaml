    Bond Futures ETN (JGBT), and the 3x Inverse Japanese Government Bond Futures ETN
    (JGBD). Government bonds are typically considered low risk, but to generate sufficient
    demand, it appears you need to lever them so they have high enough risk to warrant
    interest.  I suspect that in 10 years, everything will have a 2x and 3x derivative
    that's tradable on liquid exchanges.

- en: Now, one reason for the demand is that accounts like 401ks discourage leverage,
    so the leverage is implicit in the ETF, and not explicit.  This is a big problem
    with leverage limits because leverage can always be gamed in this way, and there
    is no simple solution.

    and so demand increases with higher volatility.  Now, in most formulations, risky
    asset demand is determined something like this.'

    the variance (denominator) by X

    I think part of it is a quantum effect, where investors are not interested in
    something until it can generate a sufficient threshold return.  That is, most
    investors basically have 'null' for their Japanese bond exposure.  A significant
    number of investors would put down $1000 if they had a chance to make $200, but
    many fewer are interested in putting down $1000 to make $100\.  Sure, they could
    always lever positions themselves but that's another level of complication, creating
    all sorts of operational risk such as issues about taxation and margin calls.
