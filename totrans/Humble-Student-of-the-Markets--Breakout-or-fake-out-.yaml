    represent consolidation and indecision. Breakouts from triangles are considered
    significant as they tend to forecast the next major direction of the underlying
    index or stock.

    but the market rallied anyhow. More importantly for technicians, the S&P 500 staged
    an upside breakout from a triangular pattern.

    it needs more time. This is probably still a bear market rally. We are likely
    still in a basing/consolidation/trading range period until this summer. The S&P
    500 has seen resistance at the 900-920 level and it will likely pause there again
    in this rally before come back down to test the old lows set in November 2008.
