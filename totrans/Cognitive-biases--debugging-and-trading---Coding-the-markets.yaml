    Of course, the field of [behavioural finance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioural_finance)
    is all about how cognitive bias causes real market participants to behave differently
    than the rational actors of the [efficent market hypothesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient_markets).
    Overcoming cognitive bias is a big part in becoming a good trader; Nierderhoffer
    and Taleb have both commented at length in their books about the psychology of
    overcoming biases to execute their trading strategies.

- en: Cognitive biases are a large factor in debugging exercises too. Having written
    some code, it can be very hard to see why it doesn’t do what’s intended. When
    debugging I often exhort myself to “listen to the system.” Cognitive bias can
    blind one to the content of error messages. Forcing oneself to read them word
    by word can direct attention to a cause or symptom.
