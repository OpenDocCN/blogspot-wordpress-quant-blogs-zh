    range from the nature of geometric compounding, convexity in high beta stocks,
    some strange manifestation of risk, or the fact that investors prefer sexy stocks
    for lots of reasons (principal-agent problems,  overconfidence, winners curse).
    Now, the latter theories are most plausible to me, but they also require something
    else, because if a fraction of irrational investors buy something, that only affects
    equilibrium prices if other rational agents are constrained in some way (or, less
    plausibly, that everyone is irrational). Given most investors allocated only 50%
    or so of their liquid wealth to stocks, I find it implausible they are constrained
    in their equity allocations--they can invest more directly.

    this point, because they basically cut the equity premium in half just by adding
    geometric averaging and survivorship bias, and I knew that was only a part of
    the adjustment menu. The relative risk theory only makes sense if the equity premium
    is zero, which previously was inconceivable, but after DMS cut it in half that

    and realistic standard errors are about 4%, no one thinks it is zero. I asserted
    it was zero previously because it seemed possible, and solved many other problems
    (eg, the missing risk premium everywhere else). Now I'm thinking I made an error.
    The equity risk premium is positive, close to the 3.5% most others believe. They
    key is that this return is not a scalar, but rather an array. Like 'the tax rate',
    it isn't one thing, and the various rates make up a subtle equilibrium between
    various interested parties, with the returns being a function of the ignorance,
    impatience, and size of the investor constituency.

    the return to an average or marginal investor, merely the non-representative efficient
    one. Several issues create a wedge between the raw index return one sees in index
    time series and the returns flowing to average investors. Thus, a modest equity
    premium to the indices is consistent with my overall hypothesis.

    equity returns over a hundred years are not positively related to economic growth,
    so it is not as if the economy is a representative firm and a risk averse individual
    is choosing how much wealth to allocate to a stochastic investment; rather, the

    from December 31, 2000, through December 31, 2010, by 6 percent annually. Fund
    complexes and the Investment Company Institute were very loathe to present this
    information because it highlighted that they are severely overrepresenting investor
    returns by using simple indexes, ignoring the many slips between cup and lip in
    the investment process. Luckily for the investing community, individual investors
    accommodate this misrepresentation, as even highly educated investors overestimate
    their personal returns by this order of magnitude (i.e., 6 percent annualized
    return). This is probably due to simple cognitive dissonance, as investors are
    mentally distressed by the conflict between a good self-image and empirical evidence
    of poor trading tactics. To reduce the discomfort, investors adjust their memory
    about that evidence and those choices. This is then selectively reinforced by
    noticing the returns of just their good performing stocks and mutual funds in
    the portfolio and not the poor ones because ex-post awareness these were mistakes
    rather than legitimate data.

    is a rather important, and unremarked, fact. The actual net returns to average

    to the competition from electronic trading, discount brokerages, the deregulation
    of commissions in 1975, and the reintroduction of odd-eighths quotes on the Nasdaq
    in the 1990s, trading costs were certainly much higher, yet most researchers look
    merely at the top line of the indexes as these costs were irrelevant, and top
    line pre-1975 returns are the same to investors as they are subsequently. If average
    investors are looking at their returns after fees and taxes, these costs should
    be highly relevant, but instead they are routinely ignored. This highlights a
    very strange incuriosity with net returns to investors. Consider the following
    items that subtract from top line returns, independent of the issues about geometric

    to Las Vegas left them flat or up a little. The equity risk premium can be thought
    of as a very subtle equilibrium, where the efficient investor who makes a 3% premium
    is the loss-leader to equity issuers, and the average investor more than makes
    up for this ‘expense’ to the insiders. Though an efficient investor may be able
    to invest in efficient passive funds and capture much of the equity premium, such
    an investor is the exception in the same way that your average blackjack player
    loses considerably more per hand than your robot optimizer. That is, just as most
    hedge fund profits go to hedge fund owners, most outside equity investment goes
    to insiders—brokers, management, initial equity owners—via the persistent mistakes
    and carelessness of your average investor. Equity returns are not simply a stochastic
    process that a singular representative investor chooses, but rather a complex
    set of returns depending on the strategy and tactics used by heterogeneous investors,
