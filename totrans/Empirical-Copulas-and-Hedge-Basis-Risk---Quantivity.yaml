    and corresponding [empirical proxy quantiles](https://quantivity.wordpress.com/2011/10/03/empirical-quantiles-proxy-cross-hedging-selection)
    share an implicit dependence on the *joint covariation* between underlying and
    proxy hedge. Of particular interest is understanding the dynamics of *basis risk*
    under extreme scenarios (both up and down), which are driven by time-varying stochastic
    joint covariation.

- en: This post quantifies and visualizes such joint covariation and basis risk via
    [copulas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copula_%28probability_theory%29), including
    modeling and empirically fitting both marginal and joint distributions using fat-tailed
    [student-t](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-distribution) distributions.
    Copulas exploit multidimensional sample ranking, and thus are thematically similar
    to empirical quantiles. This analysis also seeks to exemplify practical use of
    R for copula analysis.
