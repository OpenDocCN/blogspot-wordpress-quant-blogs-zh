    line making money, is usually too embarrassed by the straightforward nature of
    their advantage to admit it, so they have to point out some nuance that makes
    absolutely no difference. Thus, every market maker, making money off order flow,
    will swear they are adding value 'reading the tape' or trading like a turtle,
    or some other such nonsense. Finance is probably the worst, because there's so
    little alpha and so much branding and 'sticky money', that truth-telling is a
    strictly dominated strategy. If you ask your average financial executive to explain
    what he does, chances are he won't tell you even if he knows. Further, many are
    actually clueless. They don't know their job is to provide the appearance of a
    method to the whims of the main decision-maker, that they fit the right diversity
    box, or their husband is a senator. Admitting the truth would be too depressing,
    and the mind is very good at protecting its self image.

    of a Jim Cramer. I like McDonald''s: it''s clean, I like the burgers and fries,
    my kids enjoy their play areas and have a fairly nutritious lunch (hamburger with
    apple slices and milk). But their burgers tend to lose adult taste tests against
    Burger King. Why? McDonald''s burgers are primarily loaded with ketchup, which
    appeals to kids, where BK has more mayo, which appeals to adults. The solution
    might seem easy, add an option to replace ketchup with mayo. But that would make
    the burger choice seem much less alpha-like. A burger chain has a reputation,
    and they carefully project one of having super quality and care, or something
    outside the box like a square shape, or flame broiling. Heaven forbid they state,
    these are hamburgers, not steak. They are cooked by people who have trouble remembering
    to wash their hands after using the bathroom (thus the prominent signs), let alone
    the ordinal ranking of rare, medium, and well-done. A multinational corporation
    can''t produce a medium rare burger without generating a class action E. coli
    lawsuit, and a well-done piece of ground beef is about as nuanced (yet still enjoyable),
    as an ice-cold light beer.'

    the market. A thriving industry goes on, acting as if they have alpha in every
    'buy' recommendation, every burger. Thus, the newest McDonald's creation are their

    'secret sauce' in the adult burger battle, they emphasize the Angus dimension,
    and then overload the key ingredient. I prefer the more predictable double quarter

  zh: 蛋黄酱。实际上，太多了。因此，尽管他们知道这是成人汉堡争夺战中的真正“秘密酱汁”，他们强调安格斯牛肉，然后过多地添加了关键成分。我更喜欢更可预测的双份四分之一磅汉堡，不加酸黄瓜。
