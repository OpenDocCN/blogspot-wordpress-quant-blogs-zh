    included *VIX and More* as one of their [Top 100 Day Trading Blogs](http://www.currencytrading.net/2007/top-100-day-trading-blogs),
    is out with a new list of note:  [50 Places to Discover News Before It Goes Mainstream](http://www.currencytrading.net/2007/50-places-to-discover-financial-news-before-it-goes-mainstream/),
    authored by Heather Johnson.  It is a list well worth checking out, regardless
    of whether or not you follow the currency markets.'

- en: On the same subject, when you think of the information lifecycle in terms of
    the graphic below from [Monitor110](http://www.monitor110.com/), consider how
    important it is for your news sources to include blogs that give you new ideas
    to think about, long before they find their way into the mainstream media.  That
    is part of the reason why I have a “Blogs I Frequent” list on the right hand column
    of the blog.  If you haven’t checked that list lately, now might be a good time
    to revisit it, as in the past month or two I have added several excellent blogs
    featuring ~~cutting~~ bleeding edge thinking.
