- en: Yesterday I noted my Capitulative Breadth Indicator (CBI) spiked above 10 up
    to 12\. On Tuesday the number reached even higher to 18\. Eighteen is an extreme
    reading that has only been reached during 5 other periods since 1995.

- en: Before I show those dates I want to mention another breadth indicator I look
    at which also measures oversold breadth. Worden Bros. T2114 and T2116 measure
    the % of stocks trading 1 and 2 standard deviations below their 40-day moving
    average. Both are in extreme territory at the current time. T2114 (1 standard
    deviation stretch) is reading almost 87% currently. Data is available back to
    1986\. Since then there have only been 6 other periods where similar levels were
    reached.

    that resulted in sharp rebounds.
