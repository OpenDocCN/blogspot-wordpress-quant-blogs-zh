theorizing is the essence of thought, as we observe the world through a perceived sequence of patterns, and we use these theories to guide our thoughts and behavior. An ideology is a set of ideas that constitutes one's goals, expectations, and actions. Alan Greenspan

when asked if he was driven by

ideology

when he was at the Fed:

> Well, remember that what an ideology is, is a conceptual framework with the way people deal with reality. Everyone has one. You have to — to exist, you need an ideology. The question is whether it is accurate or not.

that Maoist communists were probably the largest

[cargo cult](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult)

the world has ever seen. They chose to mimick a few random characteristics of advanced economies, no matter how many lives it cost, specifically, steel. Since modern countries have lots of steel and backwards countries have none, the Communists strove to make a big pile of steel - or at least something that vaguely looked like steel.

> the result was a system where hundreds of millions of peasants were forced to throw their perfectly serviceable iron utensils and tools into backyard furnaces to make worthless pseudo-steel sludge. Who needs knives? Modern countries have steel!

It's easy with hindsight to see these were truly misguided beliefs, focused on a correlate, not a cause, of their ultimate objective: prosperity. Yet this error underlies most wrong beliefs, as you only see correlations and infer causation based on a theory, which often is a riff on an ideology.

There's nothing wrong with estimating something based on correlates as long as you realize you are doing just that, but after a while these correlates become not merely correlated attributes, but necessary and sufficient conditions, leading to what ex-post seems like extreme naiveté. This is especially true when the idea has a large constituency, as with the idea that owning a home has myriad benefits: closer communities, an incentive-compatible savings vehicle, etc. While true at some level, special interests then use these as levers to promote self-interested and unsustainable programs because their base assumption—housing prices do not decline nationwide, housing is associated with all sorts of good socio-economic outcomes—is taken as a given, and implies the optimality of what they are proposing.

Currently the education establishment in the US currently encourages mindless credentialism based on the logic that education is correlated with expertise, so many teachers have advanced degrees in education with the pretext of having greater expertise while in practice merely producing barriers of entry to competitors. Currently many regulators are focused on leverage limits, which makes sense at some level, but if it becomes a centerpiece of financial reform it will be easily gamed and give people a false sense of comfort (strangely, while everyone agrees Value-at-Risk can be misleading and is a poor target, leverage is much more misleading but seems like a prudent pillar of reform). Currently many stupid ideas and practices are driven by Cargo Cult thinking.

I'm fascinated by epistemology because so many people talk about modern science as if it somehow is immune to cargo cult thinking. I have seen first-hand how experts focus on attributes of ideas correlated with truth, as opposed to truth itself. Consider Robert E. Lucas's

[Island Model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas-Islands_model)

of business cycles. No one thinks that is relevant to explaining business cycles anymore, and while at the time was very plausible, it was an intellectual waste of resources on the order of Pets.com. Greg Mankiw is mainly known for his

[new-Keynesian menu-cost model](http://www.jstor.org/pss/1885395)

, which no one thinks has much relevance anymore, but it's his signature intellectual achievement, what gives his opinion gravitas. Romer's

[growth model](http://www.jstor.org/pss/1833190)

, Krugman's

[international trade model](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6V6D-45DJ12M-4W&_user=10&_coverDate=11/30/1979&_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_orig=search&_origin=search&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_searchStrId=1648745715&_rerunOrigin=scholar.google&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=e6ea719d985ebbf11092adb2444a27cf&searchtype=a)

, none of these are useful in explaining anything more than the stylized facts they were created to explain. But they have attributes just like theories of physics, with theorems and the use of logic applied to assumptions. They are considered top rate science, not because they lead to greater predictability or better policies, but rather like steel to Maoists, they contain something their objective contains, rigor, which--hopefully--will ultimately yield the economic truths we seek.
