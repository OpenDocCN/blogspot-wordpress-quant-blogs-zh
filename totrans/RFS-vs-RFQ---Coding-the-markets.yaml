    rather than the RFQ model used by Bloomberg, TradeWeb & BondVision. RFS is preferred
    because “the banks feel this is the fairest method for both sides of the market”.
    One can’t help suspecting a degree of self interest on the part of dealers in
    opting for RFS – surely it can’t all be for the benefit of the buy side ?'

- en: 'With an RFQ, a client is offered a firm, executable price that is good for
    the “wire time”: three seconds in the case of Bloomberg. If the client clicks
    hit/lift during the wire time, the trade is done at that price – no ifs and buts.
    With RFS, the client clicks on a price, which then goes back to the dealer for
    a last look. The dealer may reject the trade at that point. Does that favour the
    client or the dealer ?'
