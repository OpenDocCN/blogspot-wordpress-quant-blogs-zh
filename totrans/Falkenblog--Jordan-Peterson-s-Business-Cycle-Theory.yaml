    The world appears to us not in the form of objects, but rather things with an
    inherent valence or meaning according to how well they help us thrive. Thus, a
    cliff-edge does not represent a mere vertical descent, but rather, physical danger.

    and it is not obvious in which direction to adjust the lens. It is difficult for
    people to improvise solutions to their problems, as failure cascades through a
    complex system. In such a scenario, the first response is to freeze, as rats will
    freeze initially when moved to a new cage, because all they know is that their
    current environment is unmapped. Gradually, they begin to sniff around for predators,
    food, and other rats. Once they perceive that the danger is diminished sufficiently,

    each recession? Why do industry-specific problems spread into disparate sectors
    such as consumer, electronics, housing, etc.? Using the Peterson theory, when
    something sufficiently anomalous happens, investors see chaos because it portends
    a major epistemic flaw in their maps. Thus, it is best to wait and see where their
    maps are wrong before investing more. Finding a new paradigm takes time. One rarely
    understands an anomaly fully, even in hindsight. Even today’s economists disagree
    about the essential cause of the Great Depression of 1929, or the more modest
    1990 recession.

    better. In an effort to help solve the problem, the government instituted many
    new rules that made it easier for delinquent homeowners to remain in their houses
    without paying, and required a costly legal process for lenders to evict anyone
    (foreclosure now averages over 600 days). Further, the government filed numerous
    lawsuits that punished banks for making the same loans it had encouraged previously,
    but such is politics. Thus, mortgages went from a 90% to a 20% recovery rate assumption,
    and half of total bank profits in this recovery went to pay fines, so that banks
    have had one of the weakest post-trough recoveries of any expansion. This has
    contributed to our anemic expansion, and highlights that one also must foresee
    the clumsy government response to any anomaly, which makes the problem much more
    intractable.
