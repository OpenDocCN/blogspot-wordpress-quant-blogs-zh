    attempting to replicate the ever-popular [Percentile Channel Tactical Strategy](https://cssanalytics.wordpress.com/2015/02/08/a-simple-tactical-asset-allocation-portfolio-with-percentile-channels-for-dummies/
    "A “Simple” Tactical Asset Allocation Portfolio with Percentile Channels (for
    Dummies)"). The results are similar but not exactly in line- which may have to
    do with the percentile function as Ilya has pointed out in the comments. In either
    case, the general spirit remains the same and readers are encouraged to take a
    look at his analysis of the strategy.

    (CVaR) which is a calculation frequently used in risk management. The general
    idea is that you are trying to capture the expectation beyond a certain tail of
    the distribution. The CVaR is preferred to the value at risk because it more comprehensive
    than looking a just one value. Likewise, Percentile Channels are similar to value
    at risk in that context as well as traditional Donchian Channels which only look
    at one reference price. Perhaps a logical improvement would be like CVaR to use
    the average of the prices above a certain percentile threshold. This is more like
    calculating the **expected** upper or lower bound for prices. Furthermore to account
    for the fact that recent data is progressively more important than older data,
    we can weight such prices accordingly.In theory, the most important prices are
    at the extremes and should also be weighted as such. So Conditional Percentile
    Channels is simply a twist on Percentile Channels incorporating these two ideas.
    Here is how it would be calculated:'

- en: 'Basically you select a threshold like .75 and .25, and then you weight the
    prices that are above those thresholds according to both position in time (like
    a weighted moving average) and distance to max or min. This gives you a more accurate
    expected upper or lower bound for support and resistance (at least in theory).
    I know I am going to regret this, but using the same strategy ie- Percentile Channel
    Tactical Strategy in the last few posts- I substituted in the Conditional Percentile
    Channels using the same threshold of .75 and .25\. All other parameters are identical.
    Here is how that looks:'

- en: Looks like a slight improvement over the original strategy in both returns and
    risk-adjusted returns. In general, I just like the concept better since it condenses
    more information about support/resistance than either Donchian Channels or Percentile
    Channels. It also represents a good complement to moving averages which capture
    central tendency rather than price movement at the extremes. So there you have
    it- yet another twist on using channels.

  zh: 看起来在收益和风险调整后的收益方面略有改善。总的来说，我更喜欢这个概念，因为它比唐奇安通道或百分位通道更多地概括了关于支撑/阻力的信息。它也是对移动平均线的一个很好的补充，后者捕捉了中心趋势，而不是价格在极端情况下的波动。所以你看，这又是对使用通道的另一种变化。
