    on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    have been on the mark. Three weeks ago, I raised the possibility of a volatility
    storm (see

    probability of a correction, and one-third probability of a melt-up, but I am
    keeping an open mind as to the ultimate outcome". Two weeks ago, I turned more
    definitive about rising volatility and called for a volatility storm (see

    in the financial press. Bloomberg highlighted that the one and three month spread
    in the MOVE Index, which measures bond market volatility, is spiking.

    equity market volatility over the election window is sky high compared to past
    realized returns of election results.

    death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Should the election results
    be contested and wind up in the Supreme Court, the odds of a 4-4 deadlocked decision
    just rose with Ginburg's death, in which case the lower court's decision would
    stand. This raises the odds of judicial and constitutional chaos. Imagine different
    states with wildly inconsistent decisions on balloting. The Supreme Court nomination
    fight also raises the political resolve of both sides in Congress. Don't expect
    any stimulus bill before the election, and even a Continuing Resolution to fund
    the federal government beyond September 30 is in jeopardy. Watch for implied volatility
    to rise in the coming week.
