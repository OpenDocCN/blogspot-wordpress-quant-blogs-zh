    Iben drew a comparison between one of the finest contrarian investors of all time,
    the late John Templeton, dove into a battered Japanese stock market in the 1960s
    (when stocks were trading at low single digit PE ratios) and the opportunity Iben
    sees today in Russia.

    the wrong question…. The right question is: Where is the outlook the most miserable?”'

    The market cap is immense. They earn a lot of money even after, as my friend (inaudible)
    even after stealing they earn a lot of money. They pay a 5 percent dividend. As
    recently as 2006, the stock changed hands at 10 times the estimated earnings.
    So now it’s at 2.5\. And why is that? Well, because people know that there will
    be even more extreme and costly sanctions imposed on Russia. They know that something
    terrible is going to happen with the Ukraine election in a couple of weeks. And
    well it might. There is certitude about outcomes that is notable given that so
    few people saw the current set of outcomes approaching some months ago. So in
    addition to the epigram that good things happen to cheap stocks, I will offer
    this epigram. This too will pass.

    to be trying to make a bottom. Even though the eruption of the latest round of
    geopolitical tensions, RSX failed to make a lower low. The relative performance
    chart of RSX to ACWI (MSCI All-Country World Index ETF) in the bottom panel shows
    that RSX remains in a relative downtrend, though it does seem to be finding relative
    support - which is positive.

    International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) because the company’s business will
    be replaced by technology such as cloud computing.

    Jeff Bezos. Amazon’s Web Services division, whose server farms generate the processing
    power the retailer sells to heavy corporate data users on the cheap, “is killing
    it,” he said. IBM should be investing in its business and taking on the “challenge
    of the Amazons of the world” instead of doing share buybacks, according to Druckenmiller.

    as a pair trade, I chose to interpret it that way and the pair chart is shown
    below. At the time of the article, the pair trade was somewhat extended in favor
    of AMZN. Since then, the pair has come back down to earth a bit and current levels
    could serve as a good entry point.

    the semiconductor stocks. As the chart below of the relative performance of SOX
    to SPX shows, the semiconductor stocks have been displaying leadership qualities
    for all of 2014\. The recent retreat, which was due to the minor pullback that
    we saw in the last couple of weeks, shows the group to have come down to a reasonable
    long entry point for traders to want to play the momentum game.

    ideas encompassing different investment themes, different time horizons and different
    levels of risk. Not all ideas are suitable for everyone. While I have no positions
    in any of these trades at the moment, I could initiate a position at any time.
    Further, I know nothing about your portfolio or your risk tolerance. Do your own
    due diligence before putting on any of these positions.
