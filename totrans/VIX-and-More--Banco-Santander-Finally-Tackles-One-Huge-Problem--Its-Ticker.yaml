- en: With [Spain](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Spain) firmly in the
    crosshairs of Act N+1 of the [European sovereign debt crisis](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/European%20sovereign%20debt%20crisis),
    it was with great comfort that I noted yesterday’s [announcement](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/banco-santander-changes-nyse-ticker-123900425.html)
    from Spain’s largest and most important bank, Banco Santander ([STD](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/STD)),
    that the company was finally addressing what I considered to be a seriously overlooked
    problem, its ticker symbol. After kicking the can down the road for what must
    have been countless meetings and conference calls, the marketing and PR people
    can finally claim a small victory now that Banco Santander has indicated it will
    change the NYSE ticker symbol of its American Depositary Shares from “STD” to
    “SAN” effective at the commencement of trading on June 14, 2012.

    largest bank, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria ([BBVA](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/BBVA)),
    both of which have a more liquid options market than that of Spain’s ETF, [EWP](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EWP).

    ramping up in STD over the course of the last two weeks or so. The lower chart,
    however, puts recent options activity in the context of the August-October peak
    in the sovereign debt crisis, with a graphic that dates from July 1, 2011 and
    shows peak put activity (28.791 contracts per day) and implied volatility (111)
    dating from the week of August 4 – August 11, 2012.

    with potential land mines, still pales in comparison to the challenges on the
    horizon six months ago.

    Santander and Spain as a whole, but at least it might cut down on the snickers…
