    pullback table to help put the current pullback in perspective. Whether the current
    market action is best described as a pullback, correction or even bear market,
    I am happy to oblige.

    S&P 500 Index pullbacks from all-time highs and only those that go back to the
    March 2009 bottom. (Due to the all-time high requirement, I count back to the
    May 20^(th) intraday high of 2134.72, even though almost all of the damage has
    been done in the past three days.) In terms of defining the minimum pullback for
    the table, here 2.75% seems to be a natural cutoff, but I am more apt to include
    smaller numbers if it took a relatively large number of days to arrive at the
    bottom. Of course the current move does more than just squeak in: it is now the
    third largest in terms of magnitude at 12.5% and second longest from peak to trough,
    at 66 days.'

    during the decline, while the #2 pullback (17.1% in 2010) coincided with a maximum
    VIX of 48.20\. The current pullback falls into the #3 slot, while the #4 pullback
    (10.9% in 2012) saw a maximum VIX of only 26.71\. For the record, today’s VIX
    intraday high of 53.29 is the highest VIX on record outside of the 2008-2009 financial
    crisis, with data going back to 1990.'

    it is clear that concerns about slowing growth in [China](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/China)
    is the main source of investor anxiety.  Investors are clearly uneasy about various
    sub-plots related to the real level of China’s GDP, the impact of slowing Chinese
    growth on [commodities](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/commodities)
    and related markets, speculative excess and bubbles in China’s domestic stock
    market ([ASHR](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/ASHR)) and real estate
    market ([TAO](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TAO)) or broader concerns
    about the ability of the Chinese government to manage the economic transition
    from infrastructure-driven growth to growth based on domestic consumption.

    and [currencies](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/currencies). Only
    recently has the selling and higher volatility spilled over into Chinese equities
    and [emerging markets](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/emerging%20markets)
    as a whole. In fact, emerging markets have suffered greatly as of late, with the
    popular [EEM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EEM) ETF plummeting
    during the last two weeks and now down 32% from its April high. At the same time,
    the [VXEEM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXEEM) emerging markets
    volatility index soared to record of 111.39 on an intraday basis today, crushing
    the previous all-time high of 86.44.

    a bottom and have no assurance that the current bottom will hold. Most likely
    it will be tested again in the next day or two and traders will take their cues
    based on how well SPX 1867 holds up as support.
