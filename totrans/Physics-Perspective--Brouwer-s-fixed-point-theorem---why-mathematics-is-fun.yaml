- en: I'm not going to post very frequently on Brouwer's fixed point theorem, but
    I had to look into it a little today. A version of it was famously used by Ken
    Arrow and Gerard Debreu in their 1954 proof that general equilibrium models in
    economics (models of a certain kind which require about 13 assumptions to define)
    do indeed have an equilibrium set of prices which makes supply equal demand for
    all goods. There's a nice review article on that

    say, including both the interior and the boundary) and map it into itself in some
    smooth and continuous way, there has to be one point which stays fixed, i.e. is
    mapped into itself. This has some interesting and counter-intuitive implications,
    as some contributor to Wikipedia has pointed out:'

    of graph paper of equal size with coordinate systems on them, lay one flat on
    the table and crumple up (without ripping or tearing) the other one and place
    it, in any fashion, on top of the first so that the crumpled paper does not reach
    outside the flat one. There will then be at least one point of the crumpled sheet
    that lies directly above its corresponding point (i.e. the point with the same
    coordinates) of the flat sheet. This is a consequence of the *n* = 2 case of Brouwer''s
    theorem applied to the continuous map that assigns to the coordinates of every
    point of the crumpled sheet the coordinates of the point of the flat sheet immediately
    beneath it.'

    laid out on a table inside that country. There will always be a "You are Here"
    point on the map which represents that same point in the country.'

    works if one considers a smooth mapping of a set into itself. This is very important.

- en: Indeed, go to the Wikipedia page for Brouwer's theorem and in addition to the
    examples I mentioned above, they also give a three dimensional example -- the
    liquid in a cup. Stir that liquid, they suggest, and -- since the initial volume
    of liquid simply gets mapped into the same volume, with elements rearranged --
    there must be one point somewhere which has not moved. But this is a mistake unless
    you carry out the stirring with extreme care -- or use a high viscosity liquid
    such as oil or glycerine.

    which eddies create smaller eddies and you quickly get discontinuities in the
    flow down to the smallest molecular scales. In this case -- the ordinary case
    -- the mapping from the liquid's initial position to its later position is NOT
    smooth, and the theorem doesn't apply.
