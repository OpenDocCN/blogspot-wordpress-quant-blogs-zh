    countries was a little over eight months ago, in [Russia Leading the BRIC Rally](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/04/russia-leading-bric-rally.html).
    At that time, the bounce off of the March lows was barely a month old and [Russia](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Russia)
    ([RSX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/RSX)) was leading the way,
    followed closely by [India](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/India)
    ([EPI](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EPI)), with [Brazil](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Brazil)
    ([EWZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EWZ)) and [China](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/China)
    ([FXI](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/FXI)) not rallying quite as
    sharply.

    look a little tired. For all the talk of a Chinese bubble, FXI, the most popular
    Chinese ETF, is a distant fourth and falling farther behind the other BRIC ETFs
    with each passing week. Since the end of October, the top performers have been
    India and Brazil. In fact the top India ETF (EPI) is now 21% higher than it was
    the day before the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, while the Brazil ETF is 29% higher
    than its was trading just before the Lehman debacle.

    the top performer. I would not be surprised to see Brazil eclipse the bunch, followed
    by India and a resurgent China. One thing is certain: if investors can predict
    the plight of the BRIC ETFs in 2010, quite a few of the other pieces of the investment
    puzzle will magically begin fall into place.'
