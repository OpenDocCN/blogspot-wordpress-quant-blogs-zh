    tests and the like, my thoughts have wandered to the next U.S. elections, which
    are barely three months away.

- en: While there are a number of key questions that will be strongly influenced by
    the composition of Congress following the November elections, the fundamental
    question is which party will hold the majority of seats in the House of Representatives
    when voters have a chance to voice their opinions.

    the election, [RealClearPolitics.com](http://realclearpolitics.com/) is a great
    place to start. Those like me who are more interested in assigning probabilities
    to the overall outcome may prefer to keep an eye on [Intrade.com](http://www.intrade.com/),
    the [prediction market](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction_markets) site.

- en: One of the more active contracts at Intrade is based on whether the Republicans
    will wrest control of the House from the Democrats in November. The [chart of
    the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week)
    below is structured to pay off on the basis of that outcome. The chart shows that
    the collective wisdom of the crowds put the odds (contract price roughly matches
    the odds of an event happening, just as the delta of an option roughly matches
    the probability of finishing in the money at expiration) of a Republican victory
    in the area of 15% at the time President Obama was sworn in back in January 2009\.
    The odds moved over 50% for good about a month ago and currently stand at 55.1%.

- en: With many political and economic issues of great importance facing the U.S.
    in the next year or two, the composition of the U.S. House of Representatives
    will have a great deal to say not just about fiscal policy, but about a broad
    range of influences across the financial landscape.

    Rutgers will join Big 10 Conference or Rod Blagojevich will plead guilty or be
    found guilty of corruption, then Intrade is a good spot to do that too…
