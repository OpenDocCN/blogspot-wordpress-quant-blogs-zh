    should help the metals and be an even bigger tonic for mining shares. If the economy
    slips back into a funk, then a new round of policy responses (that we cannot afford)
    will gush forth, harming the dollar and thus helping the metals. The only way
    precious metals could really get hurt is for Bernanke and his central banking
    colleagues around the world to guide the global economy to a perfect, soft, noninflationary
    landing. If you think Bernanke and his buddies can usher in a painless return
    to the Goldilocks era, then avoid precious metals. Stocks, bonds, commodities,
    and the precious metals can all – in the short run – benefit from the liquidity
    provided by overly easy monetary policies. The recent positive correlations among
    these asset classes may be sending just such a message. Eventually, however, the
    asset classes will have to part ways. I think the central bankers will find a
    way to overstay their welcome, leaving the only monetary asset they can’t print
    as the asset of choice.
