Remember my post,

[Opportunity from Brexit turmoil](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2018/02/22/opportunity-from-brexit-turmoil/)

? I suggested on February 22, 2018 that we were seeing a setup for a long trade in UK equities. Brexit political chaos was reaching a crescendo, and there was a chance that we may see another referendum where the Remainers could prevail.

Since then, while there is no news of a second referendum, Business Insider reported that

[Theresa May may resign if she loses a vote on leaving the customs union after Brexit](http://www.businessinsider.com/theresa-may-could-resign-if-she-loses-a-vote-on-leaving-the-customs-union-after-brexit-2018-4)

. The FTSE 100 (top panel) has steadied, and rallied through resistance and a downside gap from early February. In addition, UK equities have turned up relative to global equities (bottom panel) and begun to outperform.

We may be seeing a similar buying opportunity in the eurozone.
