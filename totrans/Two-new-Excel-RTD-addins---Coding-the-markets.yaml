- en: I’ve been doing a lot of Excel RTD addin coding recently, as I’ve been adding
    RTD support to [SpreadServe](http://www.spreadserve.com). As part of that work
    I’ve developed two new addins, both of which I’ve posted on [github](http://github.com).
    Of course, both addins work in Excel and SpreadServe. The first, [SSAddin](https://github.com/SpreadServe/SSAddin),
    supports [quandl.com](http://quandl.com) queries and Unix cron style timer events
    on background threads. Both these things can be done with VBA of course, and that’s
    how quandl’s [existing Excel addin](https://www.quandl.com/tools/excel) does it.
    However, SSAddin gives you the means to achieve automated, scheduled downloads
    from quandl with no Visual Basic and no manual keystrokes into a GUI. The second
    addin, [kkaddin](https://github.com/osullivj/kkaddin), is based on [Kenny Kerr](http://kennykerr.ca/)‘s
    example [C# RTD code](http://weblogs.asp.net/kennykerr/Rtd3). While I was researching
    RTD I read Kenny’s excellent material on the topic. John Greenan also has [some
    quality content on his blog](http://blog.alignment-systems.com/2014/05/excel-rtd-server-implementation-in.html)
    too. However, I wasn’t able to find a single, simple, download with C# boilerplate
    code that would build and run; so that’s what kkaddin addresses.
