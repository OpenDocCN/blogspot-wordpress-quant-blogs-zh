    market and their relative uptrend remains intact. There is no hint that a correction
    has begun.

    remain robust, the shares of commodity producers continue to lag. This is curious
    when resource stocks represent the most cyclically sensitive sectors of the stock
    market.

    Gold is an alternate currency and should be a beneficiary under a scenario where
    global central banks engage in competitive devaluation. However, the price of
    gold is fallen so much that a dark cross, or

    bullion. I have been a long advocate that gold bulls should hold bullion rather
    than the shares (see

    price of gold charted on a weekly basis. I have further overlaid a 14-week RSI
    on the top panel. Note that weekly RSI is now below 30 indicating an oversold
    reading. Past oversold readings have marked points where gold stocks have outperformed
    gold. In addition, the HUI/gold ratio is nearing the bottom of 2008, when investors
    dumped gold stocks in a bout of panic selling.

    Mining stocks are also approaching a key relative support level marked by the

    constructive relative performance pattern. The chart below of the relative performance
    of this sector indicate that energy stocks have rallied through a relative downtrend
    line, i.e. they've stopped underperforming and a reversal may be close at hand.

    accumulating positions in energy and mining. My inner trader, on the other hand,
    wants to dip his toe in the energy sector, play the golds for a bounce and wait
    for the relative reversal in mining before committing funds.
