    momentum, is it too late to chase this rally?

- en: The key short-term technical indicators that I am watching are the relative
    strength of small and mid-cap stocks relative to their large cap counterparts.
    Small and mid caps have been on a tear against large cap stocks. Technicians interpret
    small cap strength as positive breadth - the broader based the advance, the more
    bullish momentum there is.

    ETF (IWM) against the SPX (SPY) shows that small caps are testing a key relative
    resistance level.

    and I-told-you-so disposition of the bulls is soaring, and overconfidence is rampant.
    And the timbre and tone of Slope is changing as well. In my own self, I have sense
    a deep and persistent disturbance – and despair – which just tells me what this
    market has done to me. And looking at stuff like Tesla – hell, yeah, it’s a great
    car, but Jesus Christ, this stock chart is just comic.

    throes of this disgusting insanity. The bad news is that we’re not just a few
    points away; ***I think we’re going to enter the final orgiastic bullish spasm
    which snuffs out the bears once and for all.*** And then all holy hell is going
    to break loose. I only hope we’re all still here to enjoy the fun, because witnessing
    worldwide financial mayhem, at long last, would put a twinkle in my eye.

    Since I am not a subscribe I have no direct knowledge of his target, but based
    on an eyeball estimate of his analog charts, it is suggestive of a Russell 2000
    target in the 1100-1120 area.

    just talking about charts; I’ve always been strong with analogs. That’s probably
    why, as a kid, my IQ tests were so misleadingly high; they rely a lot of analogies,
    and I was amazing at them, so people were led to believe I was really smart. Ha!

    in both mid and small caps stocks, it suggests that the risk/reward ratio for
    the higher beta small and mid-cap stock averages are on borrowed time. If small
    and mid-caps do fail at these key relative resistance levels, then the stock market
    will be said to be suffering from bad breadth - and another technical underpinning
    of this rally will have been removed.
