- en: In our last episode, Marc was left without a company to market his famed Unix-based
    word processor, WPScribe. The company who was in charge of marketing it had blown
    the company's monetary resources on the excesses of the mid-80's.

    (and, also, a spreadsheet for Unix, WPSpread), he loved ready through line upon
    line of the Unix kernel.

- en: A small but growing company based on Long Island came a callin' .. their name
    was Computer Associates. Fresh off their buyout of SuperCalc, they were trying
    to come up with a window and application management system for all of their future
    applications. You see, CA envisioned themselves at the time as a software development
    company, even though very few things (if any) were developed by them. Marc was
    interested in the notion of working on this project, but he would have to do it
    all on the IBM PC and MS-DOS! (By the way, the window manager project was cancelled
    on the day that Microsoft announced Windows...)

    to DOS. However, there was no marketing organization set up to sell the beast.
    At the time, a movement called Shareware had just gotten underway, and had some
    momentum. So, Marc decided to release the word processor as a shareware product,
    selling it for $35 a copy and renaming it "New York Word" (to give it sort of
    an urban feel).

- en: The word processor did very well in the shareware marketplace, selling several
    thousand copies. The initial price was $35, but Marc, who was now doing Windows
    consulting on Wall Street, tried to dissuade people from buying it by raising
    the price to $47\. That only convinced people that the product was now $12 better
    than it was before.

- en: The largest shareware distributor at the time was an organization called PC-SIG.
    They decided to embark on a big marketing campaign by highlighting several shareware
    program. The gist of the ads was to draw a characterture of the author of the
    program, write a little blurb, and show off the ad in magazines like PC Magazine
    and PC World. So, if you have old copies around, you can find a drawing of Marc
    with an elongated face and a lot more hair than he has now!

- en: Now that Marc had a word processor, he needed a nice text editor to go along
    with it. So, New York Word was stripped down, several programmer-friendly features
    were added, and since Marc was into compilers, he put together a C-like macro
    language with which you could program the editor. The editor was called ME, short
    for Magma Editor. The unique thing about this editor was that it came with full
    source code, the first commercial text editor to be marketed that way. Advertisements
    in magazines like Dr. Dobbs Journal and Computer Languages followed, and the editor
    was launched to an unsuspecting public.

- en: So now, Magma Systems was born. It consisted of Marc doing his Goldman Sachs
    gig during the day, and packing boxes full of editors and word processors at night.
    And, occasionally fielding the tech support call from Europe at 3AM in the morning...
    people who had no idea that the clocks were different when you crossed over the
    Atlantic.
