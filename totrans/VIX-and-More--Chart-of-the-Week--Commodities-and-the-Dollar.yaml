- en: One of the market-moving stories of the week was a decision by Standard & Poor’s
    to lower their outlook for AAA-rated sovereign debt of the United Kingdom from
    stable to negative. This action caused ripples in the [currency](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/currencies)
    markets, with the [dollar](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/dollar)
    coming under pressure after investors such as Bill Gross of PIMCO expressed concerns
    about the mounting U.S. deficit and potential future risk to the AAA credit rating
    for U.S. debt.

    [commodities](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/commodities) were up
    sharply, partly because commodities are seen as an effective hedge against inflation.

    below, I have captured a chart of the Rogers International Commodity Total Return
    Index ETF ([RJI](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/RJI)) versus the
    U.S. dollar. The chart shows that commodities formed a bottom in mid-February
    and have recently attracted buying in higher volumes.

- en: Shortly after commodities bottomed, the dollar peaked and has experienced several
    sharp moves down. The drop in the dollar has helped to lift prices of dollar-denominated
    commodities and pushed money toward commodities as a potential inflationary hedge.
    During the course of the past three months, commodities have had two up trending
    periods, each of which was followed by a consolidation period. With the dollar
    breaking down and in danger of testing the December support level, commodities
    could be preparing for another upward leg soon.
