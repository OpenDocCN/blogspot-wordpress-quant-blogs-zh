    VXAPL in your database)* shows that VXAPL has tended to remain in the mid-30s,
    but has ranged between the high teens to the high 50s in the first 17 months of
    its life.

    futures on the emerging markets volatility index ([VXEEM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXEEM))
    in December 2011 and followed up by [launching options on VXEEM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2012/01/cboe-adds-options-to-emerging-markets.html)
    at the end of January. The CFE also launched futures based on [VXEWZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXEWZ)
    (CBOE Brazil ETF Volatility Index, which is based on [EWZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/EWZ))
    on February 21 and added options to VXEWZ on March 6.

    golden era of shrink-wrapped volatility indices, which can serve as a product
    platform for futures, options and even exchange-traded products. If you think
    VIX-based ETPs are fun, just wait until a VXAPL-based ETP is rolled out. Of course,
    if there is not enough demand for the futures and options, some of these ETPs
    may never see the light of day, so early adopters, don’t shy about hitting some
    of those bids.

    Case for Selling Apple Puts](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2012/04/case-for-selling-apple-puts.html)
    than on any other post in the history of VIX and More. To all those who wrote,
    including those who elected to sell Apple ([AAPL](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/AAPL))
    puts, the current environment may be suitable for a revisiting this trading strategy.
