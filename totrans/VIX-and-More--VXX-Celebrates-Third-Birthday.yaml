    was worth mentioning.

- en: Known formally as the iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN, VXX was launched
    three years ago today, alongside of its sibling, the iPath S&P 500 VIX Mid-Term
    Futures ETN, [VXZ](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VXZ). Together
    these were the first VIX-based exchange traded product to be hit the market.

    of VXX ([VIX futures](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20futures),
    [contango](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/contango), [roll yield](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/roll%20yield),
    etc.) and the underlying causes of the persistent underperformance of VXX.

- en: To bring the accounting up to date, VXX was down 68.4% in its first year, then
    lost 74.6% in its second year. During its third year of trading, VXX fared much
    better, but still managed to decline 18.6%. Of course there were pockets of excellent
    performance (notably a 66.4% jump in August, as the graphic below outlines), but
    over the course of a full year, the roll yield drag was more than the volatility
    spikes were able to overcome. In fact, VXX is now down 94% from its split-adjusted
    launch price.

- en: Even with the above facts, it is still possible to trade VXX successfully from
    the long side, particularly if one keeps the holding periods as brief as possible
    and/or pays close attention to the VIX futures [term structure](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/term%20structurehttp:/vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/term%20structure).
