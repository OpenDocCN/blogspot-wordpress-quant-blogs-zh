    its implications for stocks and the like. I even came up with a plot that I called
    a “[fearogram](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/fearogram)” to map
    how changes in the VIX relative to the SPX compared with historical norms and
    recently dove into the subject of [VIX convexity](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20convexity)
    and the movements of the VIX relative to the SPX in a June 2011 [Expiring Monthly](http://www.expiringmonthly.com/)
    article, VIX Convexity.

    to the upside than the SPX has to the downside, given the historical rule of thumb
    that for every 1% change in the SPX the VIX moves approximately 4% in the opposite
    direction. For instance, from August 3 to August 8 the SPX lost 11% over the course
    of three trading days. During the same period the VIX more than doubled, gaining
    105%, considerably more than the 44% or so one would have expected. One could
    argue that much of the move in the VIX over and above the anticipated 44% gain
    represented fear and irrationality flooding into the markets.

    about 11.8%, close to half of the anticipated -4x move.

    falling almost half as fast it has over the course of its history. That, in a
    nutshell, is the fear in the market. Another way of looking at the stubbornly
    high VIX is that investors do not believe the current rally is likely to be sustained,
    so options sellers are not marking down options prices with any sense of urgency,
    estimating that continued high implied volatility will persist.
