    this ETN right from the start. Less than one week after XIV was launched, I shared
    my thoughts about XIV in the [Bespoke Investment Group](http://www.bespokeinvest.com/)’s
    [second annual roundtable](http://bespokepremium.com/roundtable/). When asked

    months was not a fluke. Sure XIV is an extremely volatile security that will experience
    sharp drawdowns on a regular basis, but for the patient investor who is able to
    steer clear of margin issues, XIV can be an excellent way to spice up one’s portfolio
