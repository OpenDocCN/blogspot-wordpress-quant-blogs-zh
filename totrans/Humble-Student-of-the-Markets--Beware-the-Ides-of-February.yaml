    I continue to believe that we are in for a short-term rally to be followed by
    a decline which will test the November lows. In this, I agree with

    remain tepidly positive for a few more weeks, but that we will ultimately observe
    another frightening leg down in the first part of next year – possibly to re-test
    the November lows, possibly to new lows, depending on the evolution of economic
    conditions. The problem isn't that stocks are expensive – they're not. The problem
    is that the U.S. economy will probably not see the beginnings of a recovery until
    the second half of 2009, and while we've seen a good deal of fear, the stock market
    tends to go through a great deal of sideways action after panics like we've observed.
    It's likely that stocks will trade in a very wide 25-35% range for months.

    that the market is undergoing a basing period, these kinds of basing periods can
    involve range-bound markets with explosive rallies and sharp declines. Here are
    some bearish indications for traders, which should banish any thoughts of sustainability
    when viewing this period of strength.

    weeks ago, while watching CNBC as the market rallied off the November lows, I
    was struck by the number of people trying to call THE BOTTOM here. Add to that
    the rash of articles that came out about that time with the same sentiment (see
    examples [here](http://clusterstock.alleyinsider.com/2008/12/admit-it-youre-worried-you-missed-the-bottom)
    and [here](http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/Is-over/story.aspx?guid=%7B93DFA91C%2D801F%2D42E9%2DBA92%2D80D2D427D1DA%7D))

    brand of radical transformation from Barack Obama are likely to be disappointed.
    Obama’s cabinet appointments have shown that he is, at best, bent on evolutionary
    rather than revolutionary change. The finance posts were filled mostly by people
    who were prominent in the former Clinton Administration. The appointment of Gates
    at Defense is nothing more than a signal of “steady as she goes”. Soon after the
    Inauguration, any market expectations that the miracle worker St Barack of Chicago
    would fix everything could very well come down to earth.'
