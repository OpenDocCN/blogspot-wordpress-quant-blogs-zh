- en: My guess, and it's only a guess, is that the general tenor of the market may
    remain tepidly positive for a few more weeks, but that we will ultimately observe
    another frightening leg down in the first part of next year – possibly to re-test
    the November lows, possibly to new lows, depending on the evolution of economic
    conditions. The problem isn't that stocks are expensive – they're not. The problem
    is that the U.S. economy will probably not see the beginnings of a recovery until
    the second half of 2009, and while we've seen a good deal of fear, the stock market
    tends to go through a great deal of sideways action after panics like we've observed.
    It's likely that stocks will trade in a very wide 25-35% range for months.

  zh: 我猜测，这只是一个猜测，市场的大致趋势可能会再保持几周的温和上涨，但最终我们会在明年年初看到另一轮令人恐惧的下跌——可能会重新测试11月的低点，也可能出现新低，这取决于经济状况的发展。问题不在于股票太贵——它们并不贵。问题在于，美国经济可能要到2009年下半年才能看到复苏的迹象，而且尽管我们已经看到了很多恐惧，但股市在像我们观察到的恐慌之后往往会有很多横盘整理。股票可能会在很宽的25-35%范围内交易数月。

    brand of radical transformation from Barack Obama are likely to be disappointed.
    Obama’s cabinet appointments have shown that he is, at best, bent on evolutionary
    rather than revolutionary change. The finance posts were filled mostly by people
    who were prominent in the former Clinton Administration. The appointment of Gates
    at Defense is nothing more than a signal of “steady as she goes”. Soon after the
    Inauguration, any market expectations that the miracle worker St Barack of Chicago
    would fix everything could very well come down to earth.'
