    - Sheila Bair: ""I fear that the litigation generated by this issue could ultimately
    be very damaging to our housing markets if it ends up unduly prolonging those
    foreclosures that are necessary and justified. The regrettable truth is that many
    of the properties currently in the foreclosure process are either vacant or occupied
    by borrowers who simply cannot make even a significantly reduced payment and have
    been in arrears for an extended time."'

    College graduates no owe $850 billion in student loans versus the $828 billion
    consumers owe credit card companies. This number is staggering. We’ll have to
    look it up, but it seems like this is the first time in history, given the short
    history of student loans, that credit card debt is less than student loan debt
    in the United States.

    want to watch the number of defaults on student debt. ***Student debt is the only
    debt in our legal system that cannot be ‘forgiven’ during a personal bankruptcy.***
    We could seriously find a generation without a job, without capabilities to pay
    the debt, and with no choice but to be servants to the banks to some degree. Although
    a “Lost Generation” is very unlikely, it is still a very small possibility. Secondly,
    we want to watch the employment rate. If employment does not improve, all of these
    new graduates will face uncertain futures moving forward. Some schools require
    students to take out six figures of debt which they could be paying on until the
    day they die. This grim future could be a reality for many. Could Sallie Mae (SLM)
    be the new owner of a slave generation induced by student debt?

    order of $100 billion. While that is a big number, it's not the kind of world
    ending figure that took down Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers. $100 billion is
    roughly the total market capitalization of Citigroup, or about 10% of the BKX.

    drag on economic growth and consumer spending, does not have the size to spark
    another Lehman-like crisis. (Note that the entire student loan market is $850
