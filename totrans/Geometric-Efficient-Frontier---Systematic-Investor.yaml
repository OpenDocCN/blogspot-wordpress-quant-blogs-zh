    Does the expected rate of return shown on the mean-variance efficient frontier
    paints the full picture? If investor’s investment horizon is longer than one period,
    for example 5 years, than the true measure of portfolio performance is [Geometric
    return](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_of_return), which is always less then
    or equal to the [Arithmetic return](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_of_return)
    plotted on the Y axis of the mean-variance efficient frontier.

    frontier and has the maximum Geometric mean at 21.6% risk level. All portfolios
    with risk greater than 21.6% are not efficient for investor with multi-period
    investment horizon.

    construction methods outlined on page 14\. The A(0,1) and A(1,1) geometric efficient
    frontiers are constructed from the classical Markowitz efficient frontier which
    use the arithmetic means as inputs. To compute portfolio geometric means I use
    the above approximation.

    classical Markowitz efficient frontier which use the individual pseudo-arithmetic
    means as inputs. I.e. I first convert individual geometric means to the pseudo-arithmetic
    means and use them later in the optimization. To compute portfolio geometric means
    I use the above approximation, same as for A(0,1) and A(1,1).

    donlp2 routine developed and copyright by [Prof. Dr. Peter Spellucci](http://www.mathematik.tu-darmstadt.de/fbereiche/numerik/staff/spellucci/spellucci.html).
    Following code might not properly execute on your computer because Rdonlp2 is
    only available for R version 2.9 or below.
