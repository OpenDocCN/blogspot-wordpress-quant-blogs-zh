- en: When I left my position as Technical Director of a new division of SGP in March
    2002, I knew that the market was starting to turn bad for consultants. Even the
    ones who were "known quantities" out there. I left SGP because I wanted to fulfill
    a dream and persue a master's degree in Percussion Performance. I had never had
    any downtime since graduating college and the pull of music was becoming stronger.

    9), I got a call from an old colleague of mine who was forming a new company and
    wanted me to be CTO of it. This position carried me until the summer of 2003,
    when we sold the company to our biggest competitor.

- en: During this time, I heard all sorts of horror stories about the consulting market.
    Nobody could find a job anywhere! At the apex of this madness, the New York Times
    magazine ran a story about a former high-flyer in the Internet world who was working
    at The Gap, selling jeans and trying to eke out a living. After we sold the company,
    I had about 2 months where I experienced the depths of the consulting marketplace.
    People with 10 years of heavy C++ were being offered $35 an hour, and were happy
    to take it!
