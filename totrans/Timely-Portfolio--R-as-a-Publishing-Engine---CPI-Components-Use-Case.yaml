- en: R was certainly not designed to be a publishing engine, but in my workflow,
    R is the primary method of content creation.  With that in mind, I have been thinking
    about a very different use case of rCharts in which we might want to include inflexible
    and not really reusable custom javascript components in our document.  As a quick
    example after updating my CPI component graph using d3.js and angular, I want
    to plug it into a document and really only need to modify a couple of parameters. 
    While someone might want to use this for different data, I doubt it.

- en: rCharts seamless integration with knitr/slidify/Rpres makes this very easy. 
    I just wonder how popular this will become.
