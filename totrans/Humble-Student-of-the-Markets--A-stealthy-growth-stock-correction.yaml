    the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time
    horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to
    answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or
    contraction (bearish)?"

    between one and two standard deviations below their 50[-day moving averages] where
    buyers usually enter,” said technical analyst Andrew Adams in a Wednesday note
    for Saut Strategy. “I don’t think the market needs to go down any more, so a bounce
    attempt should occur given all the nearby support levels.”

    market down with them, then maybe the 3,980-4,000 zone in the S&P 500 will be
    retested after all,” Adams wrote. The S&P 500 finished at 4,167.59 on Wednesday,
    1% off a record close of 4,211.47 set on April 29.

    6%, but given the damage seen in other parts of the market could lead to “some
    huge losses” elsewhere, he said. “I’d rather avoid that, so for now I think we
    can use yesterday’s lows as a test to see if that represented a selling climax
    in much of the market.”

    (dma) after being rejected twice at resistance. More worrisome is the breach of
    the relative support zone of NDX compared to the S&P 500 and ARKK to the S&P 500\.
    Market internals such as the percentage of NASDAQ 100 stocks above their 50 dma
    is not oversold enough to signal a durable bottom.
