- en: Factor returns should reflect risk, in that they have traditionally been interpreted
    as proxies for some kind of risk not measured by beta. The idea is that perhaps
    what people really care about is whether there will be another oil shock, and
    nothing matters as much. Stocks that have a high dependence on cheap oil would
    have more risk than other stocks. In the early 1980s, this was a common hypothesis,
    though later people would add things like consumption growth and inflation.

- en: Remember that our conception of risk comes from the idea that as utility functions
    are concave (have decreasing marginal utility), the higher the expected variance
    in our wealth, the lower the expected utility. Thus, $1 for certain tomorrow is
    worth more than a payoff with equal probabilities for {$0.50, $1.50}. Because
    of decreasing marginal utility, one enjoys an extra 50 cents less than one suffers
    from the 50 cent deficit, so you have to bribe people to make them indifferent
    to such an alternative, what is called the risk premium.

    did not simply jump on this assumption blindly because it was convenient, as there
    was a lot of focus on the best distributional assumption for asset returns.  I
    took the weekly returns and normalized them by a rolling volatility forecast to
    capture the heteroskedasticity (otherwise the tails are much fatter). While these
    deviations from normality are statistically significant, they aren't large. You
    can see the weekly returns are too frequent at the bottom, offset by the extra
    number of slightly-above-average returns.

    All you have to do is increase a person's risk aversion so that they 'feel' the
    downside risk more strongly, and you capture the effects of fat declines just
    as you would with some mixed distribution with more parameters. The costs are
    low, but the benefits are large. Normal distributions are additive (one normal
    plus another is still normally distributed), which makes statistics a lot easier.
    A mere 2 parameters describe the entire distribution (all the higher moments are
    linear functions of the mean and variance). Further, when x is normally distributed,

- en: As a practical matter, most metrics of risk are correlated. Beta and portfolio
    volatility have incredibly high correlations, so much so they are almost redundant.
    Minimizing beta or vol is basically the same thing.  The correlation between portfolio
    volatility and the maximum drawdown is not as high, but still highly significant.
    To the degree risk is the expected worst-case scenario, volatility/beta should
    capture a good deal of this.

    portfolios, there is nothing close to a strong correlation. Indeed, the correlation

    from several regions. For these, I normalized by subtracting the region-specific
    volatility and average returns, so that factor performance is comparable.  While
    risk is no longer negatively correlated with returns, the correlation is weak.

    if in equilibrium investors have to be indifferent, perhaps the extra 2% earned
    by high dividend stocks is compensated by the higher tax rate. Transaction costs
    could be another issue, especially for small-cap stocks, in that it may cost one
    a couple of percent more to get in and out of these positions, which would not
    be reflected in end-of-day returns but would your for small-cap investor. Such
    explanations have nothing to do with risk.'

    (supposedly) fly into flames kamikaze-style, as they are hard-wired to fly towards
    the moon to get their bearings. Clearly, this isn''t good for the moths, but rather,
    a rule-of-thumb that does not extrapolate well, especially after man discovered
    fire. Perhaps our monkey brains have similar lacunae. For example, many remember
    dating someone crazy because she was super hot, not because men like crazy girls,
    but rather, crazy girls do hot things that cause men''s limbic system to shut
    down the cerebral cortex (this is now a meme, but young fools will only learn
    by experience). Similarly, investors could be attracted to risk, not directly,
    but rather, the fact that risky stocks have attractive attributes like stories
    about transforming the workplace, or they have pot-smoking CEOs, or that they
    specifically focus more on marketing to investors as opposed to consumers.'

    to biases, these suboptimal decision-makers are a poor explanation for equilibrium
    asset prices; their bad decision-making is mainly evinced by excessive trading.
    It doesn't take many smart traders to figure out that if they steel themselves
    against those risky-stock promoters they can make large risk-adjusted returns.
    It's not complicated, you don't have to tie yourself against a mast like Odysseus,
    just don't listen to conference calls or watch CNBC, and instead just crunch datasets
    where all you know about ABC corp are its objective metrics.  Then buy the wallflower
    stocks and sell the crazy/hot ones. Arbitrageurs should counteract behavior biases
    in asset markets with free entry.

- en: Biases, departures from normality, and new factors don't explain why anything
    reasonably correlated with something related to wealth volatility has no correlation
    with average returns. This leaves the utility function. With relative risk, there
    should be no risk premium just as there isn't one. This makes factor investing
    much less attractive because, without the risk adjustment that accentuates the
    alpha, you just have the potential for making 2% extra but have to take on more
    risk to do so (by deviating from the market, creating benchmark risk).  It's not
    like there are $20 bills lying on the floor, but rather, a bunch of change in
    a fountain, and you can grab a handful if you don't mind getting soaking wet and
    mean looks.
