    on S&P500 performance](http://www.bsam.com/2016/02/22/volatility-futures-and-sp500-performance/)
    recently on our blog for Blue Sky Asset Management. We will be dedicating a section
    of the blog specifically for more technical articles. This is the first of many
    that we have planned in the coming months so stay tuned for more  geeky quant
    goodness!
