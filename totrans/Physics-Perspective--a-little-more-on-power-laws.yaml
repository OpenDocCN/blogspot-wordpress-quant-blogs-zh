- en: I actually agree with these statements. Let me try to clarify. In my post I
    said, referring to the fat tails in returns and 1/t decay of volatility correlations,
    that  "None of these patterns can be explained by anything in the standard economic
    theories of markets (the EMH etc)." The key word is of course "explained."
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The EMH has so much flexibility and is so loosely linked to real data that it
    is indeed consistent with these observations, as Ivansml (Mark) and James rightly
    point out. I think it is probably consistent with any conceivable time series
    of prices. But "being consistent with" isn't a very strong claim, especially if
    the consistency comes from making further subsidiary assumptions about how these
    fat tails might come from fluctuations in fundamental values. This seems like
    a "just so" story (even if the idea that fluctuations in fundamental values could
    have fat tails is not at all preposterous).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The point I wanted to make is that nothing (that I know of) in traditional economics/finance
    (i.e. coming out of the EMH paradigm) gives a natural and convincing explanation
    of these statistical regularities. Such an explanation would start from simple
    well accepted facts about the behaviour of individuals, firms, etc., market structures
    and so on, and then demonstrate how -- because of certain logical consequences
    following from these facts and their interactions -- we should actually expect
    to find just these kinds of power laws, with the same exponents, etc., and in
    many different markets. Reading such an explanation, you would say "Oh, now I
    see where it comes from and how it works!"

    market movements as having inherently collective origins, i.e. as reflecting large
    avalanches of trading behaviour coming out of the interactions of market participants.

    learning dynamics in a financial setting. While agent-based markets have many
    goals, I see their first scientific use as a tool for understanding the dynamics
    in relatively traditional economic models. It is these models for which economists
    often invoke the heroic assumption of convergence to rational expectations equilibrium
    where agents’ beliefs and behavior have converged to a self-consistent world view.
    Obviously, this would be a nice place to get to, but the dynamics of this journey
    are rarely spelled out. Given that financial markets appear to thrive on diverse
    opinions and behavior, a first level test of rational expectations from a heterogeneous
    learning perspective was always needed.'

    emergence of power law distributions for returns, and also long-term correlations
    in volatility. These appear to be linked to various kinds of interactions between
    participants. Essentially, the market is an ecology of interacting trading strategies,
    and it has naturally rich dynamics as new strategies invade and old strategies,
    which had been successful, fall into disuse. The market never settles into an
    equilibrium, but has continuous ongoing fluctuations.

    explanatory mechanisms, which need to be tested in detail. Just because these
    mechanisms CAN produce the right numbers doesn't mean this is really how it works

    (cumulative) distribution of returns which links it to the known power law distribution
    of the wealth of investors (and hence the size of the trades they can make). This
    model sees large movements as arising in the large actions of very wealthy market
    participants. However, this is more than merely attributing the effect to unknown
    fat tails in fundamentals, as would be the case with EMH based explanations. It
    starts with empirical observations of tail behaviour in several market quantities
    and argues that these together imply what we see for market returns.

    this in some detail soon. But I hope this explains a little why I don't find the
    EMH based ideas very interesting. Being consistent with these statistical regularities
    is not as interesting as suggesting clear paths by which they arise.

- en: Of course, I might make one other point too, and maybe this is, deep down, what
    I find most empty about the EMH paradigm. It essentially assumes away any dynamics
    in the market. Fundamentals get changed by external forces and the theory supposes
    that this great complex mass of heterogenous humanity which is the market responds
    instantaneously to find the new equilibrium which incorporates all information
    correctly. So, it treats the non-market part of the world -- the weather, politics,
    business, technology and so on -- as a rich thing with potentially complicated
    dynamics. Then it treats the market as a really simply dynamical thing which just
    gets driven in slave fashion by the outside. This to me seems perversely unnatural
    and impossible to take seriously. But it is indeed very difficult to rule out
    with hard data. The idea can always be contorted to remain consistent with observations.

    for market returns. This is indeed a tentative stylized fact which seems to hold
    with appreciable accuracy in many markets, but there may well be markets in which
    it doesn't hold (or periods in which the exponent changes). Finding such deviations 
    would be very interesting as it might offer further clues as to the mechanism
    behind this phenomenon.

    the problem:'

- en: 1\. Mandelbrot in the early 1960s showed that market returns had fat tails;
    he conjectured that they fit the so-called Stable Paretian (now called Stable
    Levy) distributions which have power law tails. These have the nice property (like
    the Gaussian) that the composition of the returns for longer intervals, built
    up from component Stable Paretian distributions, also has the same form. The market
    looks the same at different time scales.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 2\. However, Mandelbrot noted in that same paper a shortcoming of his proposal.
    You can't think of returns as being independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)
    over different time intervals because the volatility clusters -- high volatility
    predicts more to follow, and vice versa. We don't just have an i.i.d. process.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 3\. Lots of people documented volatility clustering over the next few decades,
    and in the 1980s Robert Engle and others introduced ARCH/GARCH and all that --
    simple time series models able to reproduce the realistic properties of financial
    times, including volatility clustering.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 4\. But today I found several papers from the 1990s (and later) still discussing
    the Stable Paretian distribution as a plausible model for financial time series.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: My question is simply -- why was anyone even 20 years ago still writing about
    the Stable Paretian distribution when the reality of volatility clustering was
    so well known? My understanding is that this distribution was proposed as a way
    to save the i.i.d. property (by showing that such a process can still create market
    fluctuations having similar character on all time scales). But volatility clustering
    is enough on its own to rule out any i.i.d. process.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Of course, the Stable Paretian business has by now been completely ruled out
    by empirical work establishing the value of the exponent for returns, which is
    too large to be consistent with such distributions. I just can't see why it wasn't
    relegated to the history books long before.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The only possibility, it just dawns on me, is that people may have thought that
    some minor variation of the original Mandelbrot view might work best. That is,
    let the distribution over any interval be Stable Paretian, but let the parameters
    vary a little from one moment to the next. You give up the i.i.d. but might still
    get some kind of nice stability properties as short intervals get put together
    into longer ones. You could put Mandelbrot's distribution into ARCH/GARCH rather
    than the Gaussian. But this is only a guess. Does anyone know?
