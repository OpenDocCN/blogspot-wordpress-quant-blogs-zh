# VIX and More: VWSI Ends Volatile Week at -1

> 来源：[http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/09/vwsi-ends-volatile-week-at-1.html#0001-01-01](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/09/vwsi-ends-volatile-week-at-1.html#0001-01-01)

Another volatile week is in the books, with no signs of volatility coming to an end.  While the NASDAQ and VXN took [center stage at the volatility circus](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/09/volatility-index-comparison.html) this week, the VIX managed a weekly gain of 2.85 or 12.2% to end the week at 26.23 – still the third highest end of week close since April 2003.

With back to back 12+% weekly gains in the VIX, the VWSI has slid from +2 to -1 over the past two weeks.  These are still largely neutral readings; I do not consider the VWSI to generate tradeable signals unless readings reach at least +3 or -3.

Just for fun, here are a few VIX simple moving averages:

*   10 days:  23.96
*   20 days:  25.96
*   50 days:  21.30
*   100 days:  17.61
*   200 days:  14.89
*   500 days:  13.66
*   1000 days:  14.28

If you consider that the mean VIX reading for the full 17+ years of VIX data currently stands at 18.92, then any mean reverting activity related to the numbers above is likely to involve a declining VIX.  The trick, of course, is to get the time frame right.

*(Note that in the above temperature gauge, the "bullish" and "bearish" labels apply to the VIX, not to the broader markets, which are usually negatively correlated with the VIX.)*

 ***Wine pairing:*

For a VWSI of -1 I recommend a

[pinot noir](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinot_noir)

, probably my favorite of the lighter red varietals.

Perhaps the most overlooked of the locations that produce superb

<state st="on">California</state>

pinot noir is

[Anderson Valley](http://www.avwines.com/)

, a

[diagonal finger](http://www.andersonvalleychamber.com/map.html)

that extends from northern

<place st="on"><city st="on">Sonoma</city></place>

to the Mendocino coast.

The climate in Anderson Valley is such that it seems everyone is able to make top-notch pinots, but my three favorite producers are

[Londer Vineyards](http://www.londervineyards.com/londer/index.jsp)

,

[Goldeneye](http://www.goldeneyewinery.com/)

(I believe this winery is still on the selling block; be sure to try their second label,

[Migration](http://www.migrationwine.com/)

, as well), and

[Esterlina Vineyards](http://www.esterlinavineyards.com/mm5/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&Store_Code=Esterlina&Category_Code=RED)

.

For some other suggestions on the pinot noir front, I have another blog with links to a dozen of my favorite producers: [Zin and Pinot](http://zinandpinot.blogspot.com/).  The content on that blog has been intermittent as of late, but as the markets get back toward some sort of ‘normal,’ I hope to remedy this.**
