    the context of a deeper correction. The rally duly arrived. One of the main events
    was the earnings report from Nvidia, which blew the doors off Street expectations
    both on sales and earnings. The market reacted with Nvidia failing to hold its
    overnight gains. More importantly, the Semiconductor Index weakened below a key
    relative support level.
