As the American elections approach their final denouement in two weeks, it's time to look ahead to a number of political dark clouds forming in Europe.

 recently highlighted research from Barclay's showing the collapse in support of establishment parties around the world.

The support for anti-establishment and protest parties and candidates have been on the rise - and these individuals represent threats to upset the current political status quo. After the US election in November, we have to look forward to the Italian referendum on December 4, the start of Brexit negotiations in early/mid 2017, the French election, and the German election. All of these events have the potential to tear Europe apart.

I believe that fears over the political disintegration in Europe may be overblown. Arguably, we could be seeing a near-term peak in the support of the protest vote in 2016 and 2017.
