## Race to the Bottom

Interesting read over on Wired, “Raging Bulls: How Wall Street Got Addicted to Light-Speed [Trading](http://www.wired.com/business/2012/08/ff_wallstreet_trading/all/)“.  Nice comparison of the express lane between NY and Chicago.  Brief reference to the BATS IPO issue – more details [here](http://www.nanex.net/aqck/2970.html).
