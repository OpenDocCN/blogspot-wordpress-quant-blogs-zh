- en: hosted a must-read debate for investors between Michael Pettis and Eswar Prasad
    about the outlook for China. Regular readers of this blog will be familiar to
    the work of Michael Pettis, to which I mainly subscribe. To paraphrase Pettis,
    he believes that China's growth strategy of credit driven export and infrastructure
    based growth, which depends on financial repression for cheap capital, is reaching
    an era of increasingly diminishing returns. In the wake of the global financial
    crisis of 2008, China embarked on a round hyper credit fueled infrastructure growth
    which created an enormous credit and property bubble. Beijing recognizes the risks
    and has begun to re-focus the source of growth toward the domestic consumer. Pettis
    believes that this transformation will move the Chinese economy towards a much
    slower growth rate over the next decade.

    His conclusion is based on the observation that the Chinese leadership is doing
    all the right things to transform and reform the economy. China's leadership has
    faced growth scares before and they have a history of adroitly managing the situation
    before. The naysayers are wrong and there will be no crisis or any dramatic slowdown.
