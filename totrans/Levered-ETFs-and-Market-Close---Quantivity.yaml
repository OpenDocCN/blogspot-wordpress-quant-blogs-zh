    a research article entitled [“The Dynamics of Leveraged and Inverse Exchange-Traded
    Funds”](http://www.barclaysglobal.com/secure/repository/publications/usa/ResearchPapers/Leveraged_ETF.pdf).
    This article models and analyzes numerous dynamics of levered ETF, for which traders
    may be unaware: daily returns, return divergence, path dependency, tracking errors
    vs underlying, rebalancing, and hedging.'

    hypothesis: *side effects of levered ETF will influence behavior of quantitative
    strategies which do not trade the corresponding ETFs*. To use a [quantum mechanics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics)
    analogy: levered ETFs will have [action at a distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_at_a_distance_(physics))
    effect on wholly-unrelated strategies.'

    as extant funds promise a multiple of the underlying *daily* return. The following
    quote from the article sums up the hedging argument (p. 9):'

- en: Hedging demand provides an additional momentum effect to same-day returns that
    increases the price pressure effect of any signed order inbalance regardless of
    its source…The presence of the hedge induces serial correlation in returns because
    the previous period’s hedge is linearly related to the previous return. Thus,
    hedging flows in leveraged and inverse ETFs can exacerbate same-day volatility,
    add momentum effects, and induce serial correlation in returns.

    be magnified by leveraged ETF hedging. While readers may be inclined to dismiss
    this effect as inconsequential, the impact is unexpectedly *massive* (p. 11 and
    Table 5):'

    of about 17%, while a 5% move is associated with demands equal to 50% of the close.

- en: Since we are essentially computing a weighted average, the market-on-close demand
    in value terms is just a linear function of return. However, the demand as a fraction
    of closing volume is a non-linear function of return because the re-balancing
    demand is added to the denominator too.

    and more levered and ultra short products gain traction, we would expect this
    slope to steepen” (p. 11). In other words, this effect will only become more dominant
    as these ETFs gain further traction.

    strategies. The crux is closing prices: many strategies depend upon closing prices,
    whether directly or indirect. Examples range from the well-documented overnight
    effect (*e.g.* [Goldman](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aXhs9g9il2rk))
    to the myriad close-to-close strategies. In this vein, authors calculate numerous
    regressions based upon rebalancing flows. The effects are equally interesting:'

    25%) of the day’s volume and hence of the day’s return as implied by the estimates.
    The estimate of β [2] suggests that after controlling for the day’s return movement,
    $1 billion of re-balancing flow adds 0.54% to the closing period’s return

    the authors evaluate the relationship between rebalancing flows and closing period
    volatility. Predictably, the result is “greater imbalances add to closing volatility”
    (p. 13).

    to the increasing instabilities observed over the past few months. Finally, rebalancing
    and hedging flows beg for strategies to exploit “predictable and concentrated
    trading activity near the market closes” (p. 22).
