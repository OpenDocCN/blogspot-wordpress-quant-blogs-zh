    statement and subsequent Bernanke press conference, it seems that the end of QE2
    is baked into the cake. The question is more one of what happens to ZIRP?

    is evident that one of the purposes of QE2 is to push up the prices of risky assets.

- en: In our view, quantitative easing has been a reckless policy, not only because
    it has fueled what Dallas Fed president Richard Fisher calls "extraordinary speculative
    activity," but because aside from a burst of short-term optimism, the historical
    evidence is clear that fluctuations in stock prices have very little impact on
    real spending (the so-called wealth effect is on the order of 0.03-0.05% for every
    1% change in stock prices). People consume off of perceived permanent income,
    not off of fluctuations in the prices of volatile assets. Now, it's true that
    QE2 has probably been good for a fraction of 1% in additional GDP, which should
    be sustained over a period of a year or two, and though we haven't observed real
    activity or actual industrial production that matches the optimism of survey-based
    measures such as the ISM indices, it's clear that some pent-up demand was released.
    Still, the links between monetary base expansion, stock values, and GDP growth
    are tenuous at best. ***The most predictable outcome was commodity hoarding, where
    our expectations have been fully realized, with awful consequences for the world's
    poor, not to mention for geopolitical stability***.

    whether the Fed might decide at that meeting to terminate the policy of QE2 early,
    that debate is actually moot. By the time the Fed meets later this month, QE2
    will already be at least 85% complete.

    haven't keeled over yet, the combination of bearish signals from my secondary
    indicators and the prospect of the end of the Fed's QE2 purchases are setting
    the climate for substantial downside in asset prices.
