# Fix WPF! | Tales from a Trading Desk

## Fix WPF!

Thanks to a colleague for pointing me at this [site](http://fixwpf.org/).

> FIXWPF.org is realistic in our thinking that Microsoft is unlikely to actually fix WPF as we know it today. It’s quite clear by Microsoft’s actions that technology bets like HTML5 or Silverlight are more likely to be the end result for desktop development.
