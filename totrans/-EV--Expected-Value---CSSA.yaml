  zh: 每个严肃的扑克玩家都知道一个计算，因为它对决策至关重要，那就是EV或期望值。其对交易的应用显而易见（尽管金融市场中的肥尾效应使得真正估计EV变得困难）：

  zh: 关于EV，有几个相关的原则：
- en: 1) The outcome of any hand was considered irrelevant since a pro tries to maximize
    their long-term expected EV over time. You can have a 90% chance of winning with
    the odds being known with complete certainty and still lose multiple times in
    a row due to bad luck. This is something that you learn to deal with as a necessary
    part of winning. The best way to handle this is not to change your strategy to
    micro-manage your current equity, but rather to focus on maximizing long-term
    EV and not worrying about outcomes. The same applies to traders– there is no point
    worrying about any one trade, you focus on making the right decision and then
    you have to execute from start to finish. You have zero control beyond that point.

  zh: 1) 任何一手牌的结果都被视为无关紧要，因为专业人士试图在长期内最大化其期望EV。即使你有90%的胜算，且胜负已知，仍可能因运气不佳而连续输掉多次。这是作为赢家的必经之路。应对这种情况的最佳方式不是微观管理当前的权益，而是专注于最大化长期EV，不担忧结果。交易者亦是如此——担心任何一笔交易都无济于事，关键在于做出正确决策并从始至终执行。除此之外，你无能为力。
- en: 2) EV will converge to fair value as a consequence of the law of large numbers–however
    this may take 30-50 situations even with a fixed 52-card deck. In contrast, the
    population mean of a trading strategy is not truly known with a high degree of
    certainty, so you require a larger sample to converge upon fair value assuming
    you have correctly estimated the mean. This requires that you do random sampling
    and track new samples versus the sampling distribution to ensure that you have
    the right EV estimate as well as the standard deviation of EV.

  zh: 2) 由于大数定律，EV将趋向于公平价值——但这可能需要30-50个情况，即使使用固定的52张牌。相比之下，交易策略的总体均值并不真正为人所知，具有高度的确定性，因此你需要更大的样本量来趋近于公平价值，假设你已正确估计了均值。这要求你进行随机抽样，并跟踪新样本与抽样分布的对比，以确保你拥有正确的EV估计以及EV的标准差。
- en: 3)  The best players estimate EV as being conditional upon a wide variety of
    contingencies–sort of like what Rob Hanna does at Quantifiable Edges [http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/).
    This conditional estimate is as much an art as a science, which is why Rob also
    tends to assess things on a case by case basis. The essence of  a good EV estimate
    is that you in most cases take the baseline/base case estimate and only adjust
    it based on very strong mitigating factors–perhaps you are  drawing to hit a flush
    or a straight, and are offered slightly negative EV to see the last card. In most
    cases this would be a fold, but against a very bad player in No-Limit holdem,
    this is a high EV situation because you will probably get paid a large sum if
    you are fortunate enough to complete the hand. Thus this is sort of like a situation
    where you have “option value.”

  zh: 3) 顶尖玩家将EV估计为依赖于多种条件的条件值——类似于Rob Hanna在Quantifiable Edges所做的[http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/)。这种条件估计既是艺术也是科学，这也是为什么Rob倾向于逐案评估。一个好的EV估计的核心在于，大多数情况下你采用基准/基本情况估计，并仅在有强有力的缓解因素时进行调整——也许你正在尝试完成同花或顺子，并且被提供略微负的EV以看到最后一张牌。在大多数情况下，这将是弃牌，但在无限制德州扑克中面对一个非常弱的玩家时，这是一个高EV的情况，因为如果你幸运地完成了手牌，你可能会获得一大笔钱。因此，这有点像一个具有“期权价值”的情况。
- en: 'Suggested EV applications: EV can be used in conjunction with Monte Carlo simulation
    to create out of sample equity curves that are more realistic than backtests.
     This is because a data history is just a consummation of one possible outcome
    among many, and tommorow’s market will only echo the past. The order with which
    trades occurred, and the degree to which there were lucky trades or unlucky trades
    shapes the unique pattern exhibited in the past. EV can also be computed more
    accurately by adjusting the base case EV for the type of regime/environment that
    tends to affect the value the most. As such you can create simulations of what
    you can expect depending on the market environment.   Since EV is still ephemeral
    given the nature of financial markets distributions there are many possible avenues
    to pursue a more robust approach.    This is a formula from quantum physics called
    the relativistic Breit- Wigner distribution which is  a more appropriate version
    of the Cauchy distribution which is normally used to handle “fat tails.” There
    are some interesting properties/applications for the serious nerds out there to
    explore.      ![ f(E) \sim \frac{1}{\left(E^2-M^2\right)^2+M^2\Gamma^2}. \!](img/32c71491ba5a7c4bed22f01a0db8e4ba.png)'

  zh: 建议的电动汽车应用：电动汽车可与蒙特卡洛模拟结合使用，以创建比回测更真实的样本外权益曲线。这是因为数据历史只是众多可能结果中的一个实现，而明天的市场只会回响过去。交易发生的顺序以及幸运交易或不幸交易的程度塑造了过去展现的独特模式。通过调整基准情况下的电动汽车价值，以适应最常影响价值的制度/环境类型，可以更准确地计算电动汽车。因此，您可以根据市场环境创建您可以预期的模拟。鉴于金融市场分布的性质，电动汽车仍然是短暂的，因此有许多可能的途径来追求更稳健的方法。这是一个来自量子物理学的公式，称为相对论布赖特-维格纳分布，它是通常用于处理“肥尾”的柯西分布的更适当版本。对于那些认真的极客来说，有一些有趣的特性/应用值得探索。![
