    is crucial to making decisions,  and that is the EV or expected value. The applications

    preclude true estimation of EV):'

- en: 1) The outcome of any hand was considered irrelevant since a pro tries to maximize
    their long-term expected EV over time. You can have a 90% chance of winning with
    the odds being known with complete certainty and still lose multiple times in
    a row due to bad luck. This is something that you learn to deal with as a necessary
    part of winning. The best way to handle this is not to change your strategy to
    micro-manage your current equity, but rather to focus on maximizing long-term
    EV and not worrying about outcomes. The same applies to traders– there is no point
    worrying about any one trade, you focus on making the right decision and then
    you have to execute from start to finish. You have zero control beyond that point.

- en: 2) EV will converge to fair value as a consequence of the law of large numbers–however
    this may take 30-50 situations even with a fixed 52-card deck. In contrast, the
    population mean of a trading strategy is not truly known with a high degree of
    certainty, so you require a larger sample to converge upon fair value assuming
    you have correctly estimated the mean. This requires that you do random sampling
    and track new samples versus the sampling distribution to ensure that you have
    the right EV estimate as well as the standard deviation of EV.

- en: 3)  The best players estimate EV as being conditional upon a wide variety of
    contingencies–sort of like what Rob Hanna does at Quantifiable Edges [http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/](http://quantifiableedges.blogspot.com/).
    This conditional estimate is as much an art as a science, which is why Rob also
    tends to assess things on a case by case basis. The essence of  a good EV estimate
    is that you in most cases take the baseline/base case estimate and only adjust
    it based on very strong mitigating factors–perhaps you are  drawing to hit a flush
    or a straight, and are offered slightly negative EV to see the last card. In most
    cases this would be a fold, but against a very bad player in No-Limit holdem,
    this is a high EV situation because you will probably get paid a large sum if
    you are fortunate enough to complete the hand. Thus this is sort of like a situation
    where you have “option value.”

- en: 'Suggested EV applications: EV can be used in conjunction with Monte Carlo simulation
    to create out of sample equity curves that are more realistic than backtests.
     This is because a data history is just a consummation of one possible outcome
    among many, and tommorow’s market will only echo the past. The order with which
    trades occurred, and the degree to which there were lucky trades or unlucky trades
    shapes the unique pattern exhibited in the past. EV can also be computed more
    accurately by adjusting the base case EV for the type of regime/environment that
    tends to affect the value the most. As such you can create simulations of what
    you can expect depending on the market environment.   Since EV is still ephemeral
    given the nature of financial markets distributions there are many possible avenues
    to pursue a more robust approach.    This is a formula from quantum physics called
    the relativistic Breit- Wigner distribution which is  a more appropriate version
    of the Cauchy distribution which is normally used to handle “fat tails.” There
    are some interesting properties/applications for the serious nerds out there to
    explore.      ![ f(E) \sim \frac{1}{\left(E^2-M^2\right)^2+M^2\Gamma^2}. \!](img/32c71491ba5a7c4bed22f01a0db8e4ba.png)'
