- en: If you use Coral8 on Windows, and you use Powershell for other development and
    admin tasks, you may be interested in the powershell navigation provider and cmdlets
    which I've uploaded to [http://code.google.com/p/coral8shell/](http://www.linkedin.com/redirect?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcode%2Egoogle%2Ecom%2Fp%2Fcoral8shell%2F&urlhash=x4Zq&_t=disc_detail_link)
    The nav provider supports basic cd and ls commands for workspaces, applications,
    and streams. For admin tasks, the following cmdlets have been created Get-C8Status,
    Get-C8App, Add-C8App, Remove-C8App, Start-C8App, Stop-C8App
