    from 1950\. I use market cap to GDP as a proxy for the market Price to Sales ratio.
    Many investors look at P/E ratios, but P/Es can be volatile since P/E = P/(Sales
    x Net Margin) and net margins can be volatile depending on where you are in the
    economic cycle, but Price to Sales is a far more stable ratio for evaluating long-term
    market valuations.

    market cap to GDP ratio. The equity market then topped out went sideways and entered
    a secular bear market, which coincided with a corrective phase in the market cap
    to GDP ratio, until that "valuation" metric returned to more realistic levels.

    of work to buy the SPX as a measure of the differential between the returns to
    labor and capital. Just like the Market Cap to GDP chart, this relationship remains
    stretched in favor of equity.

    time around the end of this decade given the current trajectory of adjustments.
    These conclusions are in accordance with the views of David Rosenberg and Ken
    Rogoff.

    strategist first and a quant second. There are different tools for different seasons.

- en: In secular bull markets, such as the one we experienced in the 1980's and 1990's,
    buy-and-hold was a great strategy for portfolio construction. Stocks went up.
    To control risk, you just added some bonds to control volatility and voila, a
    portfolio that balanced risk and return. To raise expected returns, you raise
    the equity weight at the cost of greater risk. To lower risk, you raise the bond
    weight at the cost of lower expected returns.

    are likely to see flat but volatile returns. Raising the equity component in a
    balanced portfolio just raises volatility, but does not significantly increase
    returns. Under these conditions, investors need to use dynamic asset allocation
    techniques such as the
