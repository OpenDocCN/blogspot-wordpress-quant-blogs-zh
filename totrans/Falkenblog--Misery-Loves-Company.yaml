    paying their mortgages, as if they are somehow the victim in this mortgage crisis.
    The mortgage crisis has certainly generated a lot of damage, but those who bought
    houses with teaser rates with little money down are hardly victims (Michael Moore
    compares them to rape victims), but rather, scammers looking for a free lunch
    (buying a home with little money down is an underpriced option on home values).

    paying his mortgage, and when a bank can actually take possession of the property.
    The average time over all states in 478, and the latest activity to help the non-paying
    renters will probably boost that further.

    victims of the USS Cole that were killed by Al Quada got about $0.4MM, and those
    who were killed idiosyncratically generally received nothing. The key to being
    a successful victim is to be a victim others can empathize with.

    from my former employer, a very (~100x more) rich guy. While I was in my career
    time out I spoke with a state legislator about state law, noting that unlike other
    states a party did not have to specify the intellectual property in question when
    alleging a violation of said property. Now, any proposed legislation would not
    affect me, but I thought the status quo was unjust. The law made confidentiality
    agreements perpetual non-competes for litigious parties with sufficient means

    anyone cares about''. True enough. Who cares about a hedge fund employee getting
    screwed? When my lawyer told the judge the allegations against me were costly
    and prevented my ability to work she said "Can''t he golf?", and the courtroom
    laughed. Sympathy is for the historically disadvantaged, the poor, and people
    aligned with such groups, and sympathy often leads to specific redress if not
    subsidy.'

    a boatload of money, because it has to come from somewhere else. Thus, you have
    the Laffer curve of redistribution where if you suffer a bizarre injustice or
    injury, you get no money or sympathy, and if everyone suffers an injury, you have
    to suck it up (though, like our '

    party was negligent or malicious, whereas injury is just random bad luck. From
    a societal point of view it makes a difference because we ought to compensate
    victims of injustice and they get to take the moral high ground, while victims
    of bad luck just get put into standard welfare programs. In practice, the difference
    is whether one side's affiliation can provide useful indirect support as a PR
    prop or voting block, or whether one party himself can provide useful direct support.
    The facts in disputes are pretty messy, requiring more effort than most are willing
    to apply, but the benefits are usually straightforward, and you can predict interested
    people's inference of messy facts pretty well based on which inference offers
    them greater benefits.

    power and profit grabs. Prior default curves for mortgage cohorts are now totally
    irrelevant because there is now little stigma for defaulting on a mortgage--rather
    the opposite--and you get to live rent free for a longer time if you stop paying.
    Pre-2006 was a different world for mortgage behavior. Such expropriations are
    not free, however, they get built into current prices and contracts, and so make
    things much worse because sellers and lenders rationally anticipate lower recovery
    rates and higher default rates. The current housing morass will not get better
    until government stops 'helping'.
