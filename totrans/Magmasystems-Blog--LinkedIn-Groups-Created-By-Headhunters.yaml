- en: I have noticed that Headhunters who operate in a particular space in Capital
    Markets or have a job opening in a certain area will create LinkedIn groups for
    the sole purpose of identifying candidates. I never join groups that have been
    created by a headhunter unless they are personally recommended to me.

    be diluted by recruiters who misuse the service.
