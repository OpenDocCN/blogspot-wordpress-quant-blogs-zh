    6-9 months, this graphic does not support that idea. Instead, it will be interesting

    seat and to some extent, the increase in stock prices has had a positive effect
    on the economic data. For the better part of January, there was a substantial
    divergence (see dotted red box in graphic below) between stocks and economic data,
    with stocks in a marked uptrend, while economic data were falling short of consensus
    expectations on a regular basis.

    data and [ISM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/ISM) services index
    marked a turning point in the performance of economic data relative to expectations,
    yet it is also clear that the data trend still lags the stock price trend by a
    significant margin.

    and [employment](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/employment) have
    been the economic underpinnings of a rise in stocks. This time around the employment
    data seem to be moving in the right direction, but manufacturing has had trouble
    living up to expectations – at least for the past two months.
