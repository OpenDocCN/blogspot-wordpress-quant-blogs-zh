    skittish and news-dependent behavior. During good times, the market is not highly
    news-driven. People are more comfortable holding overnight or over the weekend
    and are not as reactive. It’s during downtrends and near bottoms that market reactions
    to company and economic news and reports become more volatile. I decided to run
    some tests using the average absolute gap.

    A large gap up is just as “reactive” as a large gap down. The 10-day average absolute
    gap is currently about 3 times as large as the 100-day average absolute gap. It
    peaked at nearly 3.5 times on the 19th. The only other time since the inception
    of the SPY that this ratio has been this high is after 9/11/2001\. The study below
    looks at 20-day performance after different multiples have been achieved.
