    the more interesting questions going into 2017.  Should the VIX be higher or lower
    in the context of a Trump Administration relative to the Obama Administration?

    advantage of stock data prior to the 1950s, one has to make use of the DJIA rather
    than S&P averages.  While VIX data is even more interesting, the VIX was not launched
    until Bill Clinton’s inauguration and historically reconstructed data from the
    CBOE only extends back to George H. W. Bush’s presidential term.

    Herbert Hoover’s historical volatility of 42.87 more than double that of the runner-up,
    Franklin Delano Roosevelt who posted a historical volatility of 20.88.  The only
    other president to top the 20 level in terms of historical volatility was George
    W. Bush at 20.28.  At the other end of the spectrum, the least volatile presidency
    was that of Lyndon B. Johnson, where HV averaged an amazingly low 9.12.  Following
    LBJ on the low end are Dwight Eisenhower at 10.70 and Harry Truman at 12.20.

    is the exception) have seen middling volatility, with Barack Obama 6^(th) of 14
    as of today’s data, while Bill Clinton is 7^(th) and George H. W. Bush in 8^(th)

    life or not, I am obliged to observe that since the LBJ presidency there is a
    pattern of higher highs and higher lows.  Could volatility by presidential term
    be trending up?  I am certainly not ready to go that far.

    (combining data from Bill Clinton and George H. W. Bush) indicates that a middle-of-the-road
    presidency can expect historical volatility of 14.65 and a VIX of 18.91.  As far
    as the VIX is concerned, the 18.91 number aligns nicely with current
