    the VIX and More Pullback Table to reflect today’s selloff. The table shows that
    the peak to trough drop of 67.98 points (6.2%) in the SPX has exceeded the 2009
    average of 5.8%.

    low of 1037\. Today the SPX has been as low as 1033.38.

    level should the 1034 mark fail to hold. In the meantime, brave souls who heed
    the [VIX spike history](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/10/vix-spike-of-35-in-four-days-is-short.html)
    or the [strangle pong](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/10/strangle-pong.html)
    strategy should have a long bias going forward.
