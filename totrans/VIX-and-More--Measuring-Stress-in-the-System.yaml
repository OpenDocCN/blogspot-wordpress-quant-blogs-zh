    anxiety and stress in the financial markets…but not always the best one.

- en: Back in [early March 2007](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/03/credit-default-swap-canary.html),
    I suggested [credit default swaps](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/credit%20default%20swaps)
    – and particularly the [Markit](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Markit)
    indices – as a way to monitor how the markets are pricing in the risk of defaults.  Another
    common way to monitor default risk is to look at the yield spread between corporate
    bonds of various rating categories versus the (presumably) riskless US Treasury
    debt of comparable maturity.

    rates.  LIBOR (formally the London Interbank Offered Rate) is essentially the
    established rate at which banks lend to each other.  Normally LIBOR rates track
    the Fed Funds rates fairly closely, but lately the LIBOR rates have remained elevated
    even as the Fed has acted to cut rates and attempted to inject liquidity into
    the system.  If you want to get a sense of how effective the Fed has been in easing
    tight credit, LIBOR rates (and the "[TED spread](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TED%20spread),"
    which is the difference between LIBOR and the Fed Funds rate) are a good place
    to start.  As the chart below shows, even though LIBOR rates may have topped a
    month ago, they remain quite elevated when compared to the August-December period.'

    a good place to start is Michael Shedlock’s  [Failures of the Term Auction Facility](http://globaleconomicanalysis.blogspot.com/2008/04/failures-of-term-auction-facility.html)
    – which is decidedly not for the faint of heart.
