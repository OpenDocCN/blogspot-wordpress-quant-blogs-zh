    2002, there have been eight occasions when the percentage of S&P 500 above their
    50 dma has surged from below 15% to over 90% in a brief period. That latest episode
    occurred when stock prices soared off the bottom in October 2023\. These price
    surges were usually resolved in either a short-term consolidation or setback,
    but the S&P 500 was invariably higher a year later with a 100% success rate.

    and strong breakout formations. The scan isn’t meant to create a complete list
    of stocks with bullish technical outlooks.

    a weekly chart of the stock in the top panel, and the relative performance of
    the stock against the S&P 500 in the bottom panel. U chose the weekly chart as
    a way of filtering out the noise from daily price movements and better show the
    intermediate price trend. Ideally, both should be either in uptrends or breaking
    out on both an absolute and relative basis.'

- en: I found at least 29 charts with bullish technical patterns, none of which should
    be considered to be buy recommendations without further individual fundamental
    due diligence. Taken together, I came away with a stronger conviction of intermediate
    bullishness for the stock market, sector and industries. As well, this bottom-up
    analysis also pointed to bullish macro conclusions about the economy.
