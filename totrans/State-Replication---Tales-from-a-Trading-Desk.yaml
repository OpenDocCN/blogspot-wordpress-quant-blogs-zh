- en: A colleague pointed me at a few interesting articles ([Replicant](http://hackingdistributed.com/2013/12/26/introducing-replicant/))
    centred around state replication. For a long time I’ve been interested in state
    replication – I’ve blogged here and there about it over the years. The ability
    for each replicate to accept change, and propagate change to all replicas ensuring
    consistency is an interesting problem to solve. Such solutions off interesting
    scalability options in distributed applications.
