    to code. The other barrier is having sufficient theoretical and empirical knowledge.
    Getting a degree in finance can help with the latter, and a computer science degree
    can help with the former but if you want to be able to do both you often have
    to start from scratch which can be very intimidating. I recently took the [Momentum
    Trading Strategies Course](https://quantra.quantinsti.com/course/momentum-trading-strategies?utm_source=david_varadi&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=mts_course)
    by Quantra which is unique because ***it teaches you both the background theory
    and empirical research as well as how to code examples in Python***– currently
    the most popular language for algorithmic traders. Given that my coding skills
    are limited to using Microsoft Excel, this course was especially useful and I
    even learned a few new things on the research side. **Readers interested in enrolling
    in the course can follow this [link](https://quantra.quantinsti.com/course/momentum-trading-strategies?utm_source=david_varadi&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=mts_course)

- en: First I have to say that this is a really comprehensive course with very slick
    technology for the e-learning community. The course took me a couple days to complete
    which was longer than I expected but it also went into far greater depth than
    I expected as well. To get the most out of the course you should also read the
    recommended research articles and also work on coding the examples.

    but gradually builds and gets more advanced with each segment. The topics covered
    early on include answering what momentum is and why it exists as an anomaly. By
    the time you get to the fifth section you are being introduced to Python and how
    to work with commands and loading in data for analysis. You then cover more advanced
    topics like how to use the Hurst Exponent to cross-sectional arbitrage strategies
    in futures that exploit roll returns.

    momentum is neatly summarized and the course also covers important topics like
    Momentum Crashes and risk management. Each segment has examples linked to using
    Python. There are also multiple choice questions that are there to test your memory
    and comprehension of the material. As you reach the end of the course you are
    introduced to even more practical topics like how to automate trading strategies
    and link to broker APIs.

    alternative that both students and traders/investors need to make their dreams
    of having their own automated strategy a reality. In subsequent posts I plan to
    continue to share my learning journey by trying new courses and will provide readers
    again with a review. Hats off to the team at [QuantInsti](https://www.quantinsti.com/?utm_source=david_varadi&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=CSSA)
    for being an innovator in this space.
