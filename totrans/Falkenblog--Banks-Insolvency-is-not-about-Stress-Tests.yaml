    banks are near insolvent. They pulled in a credit firm, CreditSights, to generate
    the stress test. They produced some really large losses, like which generates
    some really large numbers, like $119B for Wells Fargo, which isn't inconceivable
    given they have about $1.3 Terabucks on their balance sheet.

    say someone is "dead" if they are dead assuming they were run over by a bus. Further,
    without any details on the stress test, you might as well say "I pulled this number
    out of a monkey's butt--but I can still give you three significant digits!"

    losses in the stress tests. Break them out by product type to sufficient level
    of granularity (eg, a subprime loan where the owner has no equity is different
    than a conforming mortgage where the owner has a 50% equity stake). Without such
    additional information, their numbers are meaningless.
