    antenna heading. Walk away from the antenna site along this line, pausing every
    500 feet or so. Make sure you’re still on the heading line and take a picture
    of the antenna with your cell phone. Back at home, get the GPS coordinates of
    the pictures and plot them with GoogleEarth to get the heading line. It only takes
    a few points to establish a line.

- en: '**Bookmarks:** These posts contain well over 100 links that I curated from
    probably more than 1,000 web pages reviewed in pulling this material together.
    I had to set aside my old bad habits of piling up browser windows, each with countless
    tabs. Given many simultaneous lines of investigation and countless tangents, the
    old way just didn’t scale. Find a way to organize bookmarks and sync them across
    devices. Maybe [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/) if you don’t like the services
    provided by your browser?'

    them. I use the key combination `Command-Control-Shift-4` on my Mac to begin selecting
    an interesting screenshot area. I paste that into `Preview` and annotate it there.
    I think 10.14 has something even better in the offing.'

    gone to a lot of effort to obscure ownership of their shortwave trading assets,
    so I haven’t talked much about ownership. Yet reporters have combed through public
    records and figured it out in [some](https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/telecom/wireless/wall-street-tries-shortwave-radio-to-make-highfrequency-trades-across-the-atlantic)
    [cases](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-18/hft-traders-dust-off-19th-century-tool-in-search-of-market-edge).
    They don’t tell you how they did it, but [Matt Hurd has shown how he connected
    the dots](https://meanderful.blogspot.com/2018/06/shortwave-trading-who-is-that-in-bob.html)
    on his excellent [Meanderful blog](https://meanderful.blogspot.com/).'

- en: '**Latest Imagery:** Watch out for the Google Earth checkbox in the lower-left
    hand corner under `Layers` for `3D Buildings`. It does make the buildings look
    better in some places, but it can have the side effect of hiding more recent imagery
    that doesn’t have the 3D info. I recommend running without `3D Buildings` checked.'

    had been granted for an [antenna site in Alpine, New Jersey](https://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?params=40_57_40.4_N_73_55_24_w).
    Construction had been approved for nearly a year with no activity when I checked
    it. A drone would be a good way to check the site. The local police knew I was
    looking around because I left my car parked where it could be seen from the main
    road.[![](img/511090187e3e6868d337f84bc1d35bfc.png)](https://sniperinmahwah.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/capture-d_ecc81cran-2018-07-16-acc80-20-51-39.png)'

    transmitting from Aurora, Illinois and Secaucus, New Jersey. The [Anchorage antenna
    site](https://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?params=61_6_13_N_149_40_18_w)
    would be very near the shortest path between CME and Tokyo. The shortwave antenna
    heading would be pointing at Tokyo. That’s a pretty good pile of circumstantial
    evidence that shortwave trading is planned for the site. I couldn’t find pictures
    of anything that had been built there when I looked around with Google Street
    View.'

    advantage when transmitting, compared to the more rural sites chosen to minimize
    receiving noise. The existing tower had two cellular carriers and no shortwave
    when I visited on April 11, 2018.'
