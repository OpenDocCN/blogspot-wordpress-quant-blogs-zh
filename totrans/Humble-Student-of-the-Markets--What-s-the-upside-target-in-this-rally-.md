# Humble Student of the Markets: What's the upside target in this rally?

**Mid-week market update:**

As the major US equity indices reach fresh all-time highs, it is time to ponder the question of how far the current upleg is likely to carry us. While technical analysts have several techniques available at their fingertips, I rely mostly on the venerable

[point and figure charting system](http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?st=point+and+figure&id=chart_school:chart_analysis:pnf_charts:pnf_basics)

 (click link for primer), which was first used in the late 19th Century, to determine upside targets.

Using the point and figure charting tool at stockcharts, I get an upside target of 2549 for the SPX with a traditional box size and 3 point reversal.

If I vary the parameters to a 1% box size and a 3 point reversal, the upside target is 2524\. The difference seems to be the width of the consolidation pattern and the site of the upside breakout.

Is the target 2524 or 2549? What gives?
