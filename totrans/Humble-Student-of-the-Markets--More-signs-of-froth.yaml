    great-rotation inspired selloff (they''re not really that worried about a shift

    gems for our international strategy. Another sleeper out there is segments of
    Africa where private equity is finding a home and even more liquid capital inflows
    into equities are rising to levels not seen in two years - to little fanfare,
    the frontier markets are up 8% so far this year, outpacing both the developed
    world and the traditional emerging market universe. See *[Investors Scramble for
    Africa](//www.blogger.com/)* on page 19 of the FT.

    or that Kenya is up 46% (in USD terms)? Does anyone even know where these countries
    are on a map? Ghana has been a real hotspot for money inflows and its market has
    rallied 18%. Of course, liquidity is low in these markets and volatility high,
    but by all accounts, forward and trailing P/E ratios are among the lowest in the
    world and the FT article cites a nice 6% dividend yield to boost.
