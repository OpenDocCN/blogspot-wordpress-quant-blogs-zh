Mitch Cherniak poses a question that I posed a few weeks ago about "compensating events".

Mitch seems to be involved in that same project that produced Streambase. I am not sure if Cherniak is involved with Streambase in any way, but it would be interesting in the Streambase folks have thought about this same topic.
