    relative to expectations – at least in the 2 ½ years I have been collecting this
    data and putting it through my proprietary analytics.

    and general economic data that coincided with bearish downturns in stocks. So
    far in 2012, the disappointments in manufacturing and general economic data have
    not been able to put a dent in the stock market rally. My sense is that this data
    and the stock market will be moving in the same direction within the next month.
    Whether that means an uptick in the data or a downtick in stocks remains to be
    seen.”*'

    report, [ISM](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/ISM) manufacturing index
    and construction numbers, it is clear that the weakness is no longer confined
    to manufacturing and housing, but has also dragged down employment and well as
    consumer spending and confidence.

    the beginning of 2010 across all categories.  For the record, the only other time
    there was a week in which data was this poor relative to expectations was in the
    middle of February 2011, at which point the data was pulling back from an all-time
    high, about 2 ½ months before data and equities topped and began their swoon.

    for the last six months or so stocks have been more correlated with employment
    data than with any other measure of economic activity.
