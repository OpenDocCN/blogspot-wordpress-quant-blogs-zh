    investors pay for better long-term performance. But a recent analysis by Oxford
    Economics found that the average S&P 500 pullback during non-recessionary periods
    is -15.4% and -36% during recessions.

    for the S&P 500 was about -10%. If there is no recession, the downside risk is
    relatively limited. However, Fed Funds futures expect five quarter-point rate
    hikes in 2022, with some strategists calling for as many as seven. The current
    rate of expected tightening will push the 2s10s yield curve to invert in late
    2022 or early 2023, which would be a recession signal. Markets look ahead 6-18
    months. A 2023 recession translates into an equity bear market in 2022\. Suddenly,
    the recent -10% S&P 500 decline could become a prelude to a vicious bear market.

    of the G7 central banks except for the BoJ turning hawkish, can the Fed rescue
    the stock market from the 1982 analogue by engineering a soft landing?
