    the short-term (one month) [VIX ETN](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/VIX%20ETN),
    was an immediate success, at least as judged by the volume of trading, which exceeded
    100,000 in each of the first eight sessions. Interest in VXX seemed to wane for
    awhile, then suddenly surged last Wednesday, as I reported in [VXX Sets New Volume
    Record](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2009/03/vxx-sets-new-volume-record.html).

    share day, VXX now can claim four consecutive days of new volume records, surpassing
    the old record (dotted green line) that was established on the second day of trading.

    indicator with the passage of time. Volume climaxes should provide some insight
    into the mindset of the retail trader and provide some contrarian signals at sentiment
    extremes.”*'

- en: I have no way of knowing whether the recent surge in volume is the result of
    bearish directional plays (i.e., bearish on stocks, bullish on volatility) on
    increased hedging activity. My hunch continues to be that the bulk of VXX trading
    is largely directional speculation and may provide to be a contrarian signal.
    They again, VXX traders may ultimately prove to be part of the smart money crowd.
