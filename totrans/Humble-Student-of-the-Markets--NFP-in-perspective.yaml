- en: The chart shows that the current and previous cycles show similar technical
    patterns. The relative performance of the index first breaks the relative downtrend
    line and spends some time basing before starting new relative uptrends. Currently,
    the index appears to be in a basing period, indicating that the employment situation
    has stabilized. It may be too early to be postulating a new uptrend.

    don’t get too excited over a single number.
