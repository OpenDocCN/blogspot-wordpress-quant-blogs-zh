    that the intercept is the riskfree rate and the coefficient on beta is the expected
    market return in excess of the risk-free rate, E(RM) - Rf. The regressions consistently
    find that the intercept is greater than the average risk-free rate (typically
    proxied as the return on a one-month Treasury bill), and the coefficient on beta
    is less than the average excess market return (proxied as the average return on
    a portfolio of U.S. common stocks minus the Treasury bill rate). This is true
    in the early tests, such as Douglas (1968), Black, Jensen and Scholes (1972),
    Miller and Scholes (1972), Blume and Friend (1973), and Fama and MacBeth (1973),
    as well as in more recent cross-section regression tests, like Fama and French
    (1992).

    confirmed in time series tests, such as Friend and Blume (1970), Black, Jensen,
    and Scholes (1972), and Stambaugh (1982). The intercepts in time series regressions
    of excess asset returns on the excess market return are positive for assets with
    low betas and negative for assets with high betas.

    it supposedly was.  Rather, we emphasized that you could not reject the CAPM if
    you threw the kitchen sink of uncertainties and refinements in there. This kind
    of historical revisionism, common among stock prognosticators and consultants,
    is really misleading because it makes it seem that a bunch of really smart experts
    are never really wrong about something right in the middle of their bailiwick.
