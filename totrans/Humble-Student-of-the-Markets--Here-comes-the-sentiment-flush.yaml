    (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold
    extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa). Subscribers receive
    real-time alerts of model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of the email
    alerts is updated weekly [here](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/trading-track-record/).
    The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that
    began in March 2016 is shown below.

    November. The violation resolved with the index is testing initial support at
    the 50 dma at about 5110\. Secondary support can be found at the upside gap in
    the wake of the last NVIDIA earnings report at roughly 5000 and strong support
    at the breakout level at about 4800.

    which is a tactical sell signal, but hasn’t quite yet reached an oversold level.
    I am inclined to look for an oversold reading before turning more constructive
    on stock prices after a major trend break.
