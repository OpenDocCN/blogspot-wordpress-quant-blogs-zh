- en: After 2 ½ hours of trading in today’s regular session, it looks as if the market
    is starting to get a handle on what sort of premium is appropriate for the VelocityShares
    Daily 2x VIX Short-Term ETNs ([TVIX](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/TVIX)).

    that Credit Suisse ([CS](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/CS)) suspended
    creation units in TVIX due to “internal limits on the size of the ETNs.” Today
    it is possible to track the impact of that decision on shares of TVIX relative
    to its [intraday indicative value](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/intraday%20indicative%20value)
    and/or relative to a similar ETF, [UVXY](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/UVXY).

    of TVIX-TVIX.IV shows the difference between TVIX relative to its indicative value.
    Note that this difference was as high as 1.04 points (6.0%) earlier in today’s
    session and has fallen as low as 2.3% in the last few minutes.

    just look at today’s percentage change in TVIX minus the change in UVXY to get
    a sense of the new TVIX premium.

    anticipation of a possible short squeeze in TVIX.

- en: Anyone who had a position in TVIX coming into today’s session has clearly been
    impacted by the imbalance between supply and demand. Going forward, the appropriate
    question for new longs or shorts is whether the current TVIX premium level will
    increase, decrease or remain the same. Before anyone jumps to conclusions based
    on a couple of hours of trading, it would be helpful to see what happens to the
    TVIX-TVIX.IV relationship during the next big VIX spike. I would certainly not
    assume that the current premium is appropriate for all market conditions.
