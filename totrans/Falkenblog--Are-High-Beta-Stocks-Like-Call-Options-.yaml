    high beta stocks makes perfect sense. Their idea is that high beta stocks actually
    are leverage with a put option, because unlike a levered fund where you can lose
    2 times your investment (200%), a beta=2 portfolio can only lose 100%. In their

    in an important way from explicit borrowing. Investors should prefer this kind
    of leverage, and, in an efficiently priced market, they will accept a lower return
    for it. As we will show, the performance of high beta is not a product of excessive
    demand, but rather a reasonable and rational consequence of the fact that it provides
    a convex payoff to the market.

    people intuit, the other the technical metric in financial theory that generates
    a return premium. The risk that generates a risk premium is solely a function
    of expected covariance with some risk factor. Convexity just means the average
    expected risk in the future is nonlinear, but there's still a simple linear function
    of this expected covariance that should relate to the expected return. Convex
    payouts in options may seem less risky, and indeed are often sold via the pitch
    that they have 'limited downside.' If losing 100% is risk reduction for you, your
    broker probably has you on speed dial.

    not because of a 'risk premium' in the technical sense. That is, the 'option premium'
    above the 'intrinsic value' is purely a risk neutral expected value. The convexity
    in payoffs should show up in the expected returns, which should show in average
    returns over a large enough sample. As the authors note, high beta stocks under
    perform historically in the US and internationally, so it is implausible to say
    this is simple a 'peso problem' of having a small sample.

    being levered 2 times where you can lose 200%, in practice this convexity is quite
    small. Above is their empirical estimation of the convexity in high beta equities.
    While there is a little convexity, it is quite small, not significantly different
    than zero (ie, it's pretty linear). It's implausible to think this minor amount
    of curvature is practically important.

    in down markets than in up moves. True enough, but this highlights having a good
    conditional beta forecast that recognizes this. By now everyone should know that
    in highly volatile times like 2008, stocks tend to decline and correlations increase,
    compressing the cross-section of beta (lowering high betas and increasing low
    betas). In practice, you want a bayesian adjustment or shrinkage parameter to
    your beta estimation that recognizes this (more shrinkage in bull or declining
    volatility estimation periods).

    The low return to high beta stocks is still a puzzle to standard theory because
    these stock returns include the convex payout, and this should show up in the
    average returns of stocks that implicitly include them. Not only is the convexity
    slight, high beta equities have lower than average returns historically.
