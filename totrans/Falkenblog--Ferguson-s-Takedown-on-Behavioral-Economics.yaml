    then begs the question as to why we think some subset of intellectuals or regulators

- en: Thaler, in a recent interview, said, “If there’s a regulatory philosophy in
    behavioral economics, it’s that we should recognize that people in the economy
    are human and that there are people out there trying to take advantage of them.”
    In this sense, behavioral economics is just conventional 1960s liberalism—and
    conventional 1960s economics, too—that assumes the free market itself is a kind
    of unending con game, with the smart guys exploiting the saps. As an advocate
    for the market’s hapless victims, the government has the responsibility to undo
    the con, a task that will require only the smartest administrators operating according
    to only the latest scientific research and making the most exquisite moral judgments.

    It is less helpful to the rest of us, because it runs counter to every intuition
    a person has about himself. Nobody sees himself always as a boob, constantly misunderstanding
    his place in the world and the effect he has upon it. Surely the behavioral economists
    don’t see themselves that way. Only rational people can police the irrationality
    of others according to the principles of an advanced scientific discipline. If
    the behavioralists were boobs too, their entire edifice would collapse from its
    own contradictions. Somebody’s got to be smart enough to see how silly the rest
    of us are.
