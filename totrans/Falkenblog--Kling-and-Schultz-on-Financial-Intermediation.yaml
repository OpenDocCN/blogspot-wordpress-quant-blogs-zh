- en: In the last section of the book, however, I found their general description
    of finance to have a misleading emphasis. There was an exposition where assets
    have risk characteristics that are obscured as they are passed up a food chain,
    until finally there is greater liquidity, but less information available. Risk
    is transferred, but because of the lack of transparency, it actually increases.

- en: Clearly, there is transferral of risk in finance, but I think this is not the
    essence of finance. Finance is intermediation, taking money from savers and giving
    to people who want to use that money. They, in turn, promise to pay it back. The
    process generates prices that act as signals to inform those borrowers and savers
    how best to borrow or save.

    clearing, originating, servicing, and warehousing. These specializations make
    for different focus by various firms, so that things important to one set of financial
    institutions are often irrelevant for another, and ''risk'' means different things
    to different parties, because the risk they retain have different characteristics.'

    It involves marketing, designing products with attractive features, and doing
    the initial credit evaluation of the borrower and collateral check (underwriting).Risks
    here involve making 'innovations' to the product that are material, while assuming
    they are not. As it takes several months for a bad loan to reveal itself, this
    is why banking is very different than market making, one should have seen several
    lending cycles to appreciate the importance of various traditions.

    so one is left with various exposures to systematic risks: credit cards, housing,
    banking in general, etc. The ultimate risks due to broad covariance with ''the
    market'', of course, do not disappear, which is the basis of portfolio theory,
    that only these risks are ''priced'' in the sense that one expects a premium for
    their discomfort. Alas, that theory fails empirically, in that no one has been
    able to find a general covariance that explains the relative returns of assets

- en: These 5 attributes of finance are complements, and so many firms have overlapping
    functions. Yet, some specialize, and so investment companies often are merely
    in the process of warehousing, buying equities or debt and bundling them into
    portfolios. As the ultimate owners, these warehousers hold most of the value of
    the investment, yet, some of the value must be apportioned to each, necessary
    part of the financial process, and so servicers, clearing firms, market makers,
    and originators receive some of the money, often a fixed transaction cost. It
    is wise to keep originators honest, and servicers diligent, by having them retain
    some of the residual risk of any investment.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This does not contradict the idea of financial intermediation as risk transfer,
    yet it highlights the fact that the basic risks that are kept away from the warehousing
    are generally those that are presumed to disappear. A good originator, or servicer,
    monitors and manages his task so that an investor can assume his asset has a certain
    expected return and variance and covariance.
