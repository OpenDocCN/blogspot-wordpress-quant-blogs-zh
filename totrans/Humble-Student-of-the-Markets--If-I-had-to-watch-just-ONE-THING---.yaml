    to keep your eye on the ball and not to get overly distracted. If I had to just
    had to watch just one thing, it would be how forward 12-month EPS are evolving.

    In that context, the current market weakness makes sense because what`s really
    bothering the market is a lack of growth. If the growth outlook were to improve,
    stock prices would stabilize and start rising again.

    as a way of bolstering the bear case, this analysis from Ed Yardeni shows that

    forward 12-month EPS, which is far more stable.

    an aggregate forward 12-month EPS, you can get it from Factset. Unfortunately,
    Factset only updates their estimates weekly on Fridays. If you are impatient,
    there are a number of ways of monitoring how growth expectations are changing
    in real-time.
