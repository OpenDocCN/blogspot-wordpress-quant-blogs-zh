    would think that a nice 2.2% gain ([thank you GSIC](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/04/cnbc-million-dollar-portfolio-challenge_26.html))
    in addition to maxing out on the $3000 ‘bonus bucks’ trivia winnings would have
    served me well on a day in which the markets were essentially flat.  That was
    not the case yesterday, as the [AMZN](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=amzn&hl=en)
    bus rolled past me – just like the [BIDU](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=bidu&hl=en)
    bus has done today – and I ended up dropping 20 places to #1280.  One of these
    days, I need to catch a ride on that bus…'

    to these gains, my portfolio was up to $1.73 million coming in to the trading
    day, still good enough to keep me in the top 0.1% of the [1,382,297 contestants](http://www.cnbc.com/id/18349108).  It
    looks like I could be moving up a little today, perhaps even in to the top 1000,
    as I have all my chips on [NetLogic Microsystems (NETL)](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=netl&hl=en),
    whose [positive earnings report](http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/070426/20070426006121.html?.v=1)
    has the stock up 7% at the moment, down from a 14% advance earlier this morning.'

- en: On the horn front, if old mono recordings of [Dennis Brain](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/04/cnbc-million-dollar-portfolio-challenge_26.html)
    are not your thing, try the more modern recordings of [Barry Tuckwell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Tuckwell).  As
    luck would have it, he is responsible for what may be the second best recording
    of the [Mozart Horn Concertos](http://www.amazon.com/Mozart-Horn-Concertos-Nos-1-4/dp/B00005RD9N),
    but one that benefits from 1990 recording technology. In addition to the Mozart
    works, there are [many other](http://www.amazon.com/s/103-0088821-7291048?ie=UTF8&search-alias=classical&keywords=Barry%20Tuckwell)
    excellent Tuckwell recordings to choose from, including [The Art of Barry Tuckwell](http://www.amazon.com/Art-Barry-Tuckwell-Ludwig-Beethoven/dp/B000E5L8AC/ref=sr_1_1/103-0088821-7291048?ie=UTF8&s=music&amp;qid=1177693486&sr=1-1),
    which is pictured at the right.
