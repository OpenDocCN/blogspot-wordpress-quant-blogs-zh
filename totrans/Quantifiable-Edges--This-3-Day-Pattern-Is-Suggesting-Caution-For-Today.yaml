    a 50-day high, then an inside day, and then another 50-day high.  Below I have

- en: Risk/reward here heavily favors the short side. The average drawdown is slightly
    over 4 times the size the average run-up. Also notable is that every instance
    saw drawdown of at least 0.35% the next day, but only 1 of the 15 instances saw
    run-up of at least 0.35%. Traders may want to take this into consideration for
    the upcoming day.
