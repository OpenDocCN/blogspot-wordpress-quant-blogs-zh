- en: The result is today’s chronological oddity in which I use this space to pull
    from my personal archives some of the computer hardware and software that still
    generate nostalgic smiles more than 15 years after I first used them.  All examples
    date (I believe) from before the 1992 launch of [Windows 3.1](http://www.computerhope.com/win3x.htm)
    that essentially ended the DOS/keyboard era of personal computing.

    – disk compression technology that turned a 10 MB hard drive into a 20 MB one.  Stac
    was one of many innovative small software companies that Microsoft out-marketed
    and eventually made irrelevant via operating system bloat.  Bonus points if you
    have ever heard of Squish Disk or used it to stretch the capacity of 720k floppies.'

    pure joy of solving your problems and getting you up and running.  Hard to imagine
    in the current environment…  Key components were Unerase and Disk Doctor

    years later I have owned approximately 25 laptops and zero (count ‘em) desktops.  Despite
    the 768k [RAM disk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAM_disk), this was so technologically
    backward, even for its time, that it forced you to learn all sorts of innovative
    workarounds.  Fortunately, very limited technology is a great way to develop and
