    Risk Measures, and Portfolio Construction. I will use simple and naive historical

- en: To create [efficient frontier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient_frontier),
    I will consider portfolios with allocations to any asset class ranging between
    0% and 80% and total portfolio weight equal to 100%. (I limited the maximum allocation
    to any asset class to 80%, just as an example)

- en: The Transition Map displays portfolio weights as we move along the efficient
    frontier. I display portfolio risk along the X axis, and portfolio weights along
    the Y axis. The width of the slice represents the portfolio weight for the given
    risk level. For example, in the above Transition Map plot, the allocation to Gold
    (GLD – gray) was about 20% at the lower risk level and steadily grew to 80% at
    the higher risk level. Similarly, the allocation to Bonds (TLT – pink) was about
    50% at the lower risk level and steadily shrank to 0% at the higher risk level.

- en: Finally I want to go over logic of “portopt” function that creates efficient
    frontier for us. The first step to create efficient frontier is to find the top,right
    (maximum return portfolio) and bottom,left (minimum risk portfolio). Next, I divide
    the return space between minimum risk portfolio and maximum return portfolio into
    nportfolios equally spaced points. For each point, I find minimum risk portfolio
    with additional constraint that portfolio return has to be equal target return
    for this point. The last step is to compute returns and risks for portfolio on
    efficient frontier.
