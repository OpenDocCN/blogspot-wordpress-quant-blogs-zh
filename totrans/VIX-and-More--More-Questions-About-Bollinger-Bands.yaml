    triggered several questions from readers about the nature of the [Bollinger Bands](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Bollinger%20bands)
    data and the usefulness of these bands to traders.

- en: One reader asked whether I intended to say that the two standard deviations
    should contain 95.45%. While this is what would expect from a Gaussian or [normal
    distribution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution), the distribution
    of stock prices does not follow a normal distribution. In fact, they tend to have
    fat tails or what statisticians call positive [kurtosis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurtosis).

    John Bollinger talks about the extensive research he did which demonstrated that
    Bollinger Bands do not capture as much of the data as would be expected from statistics
    associated with a normal distribution.

- en: '*There are two possible reasons why we don''t get as high as a level of containment
    as we would expect -- near 95 percent with 2 standard deviation bands. First,
    we are using the population calculation, which results in slightly tighter bands
    than the sample calculation. Second, the distribution of stock prices is not normal
    -- there are more observations at the extremes than one would expect -- so there
    are more data points outside the bands too. There are undoubtedly more factors,
    but these appear to be the main ones.”*'

- en: '*“I''ve never understood the value of Bollinger bands. They don''t provide
    a measure of volatility since as the chart gets more volatile the bands expand.
    One might look at the width of the band to estimate volatility. But that seems
    like a very imprecise measure. It doesn''t really stand out. A graph of historical
    volatility would be much more useful.'

    again, as the item moves farther from the mean, the bands expand. There are many
    instances in which the chart touched the extreme of the band only to continue
    on farther -- with the band following along.”*

- en: While not trying to sound like an apologist for Bollinger Bands, it is important
    to note that these are one way of measuring [historical volatility](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/historical%20volatility)
    (albeit not the standard approach) and they have the benefit of providing a visual
    shorthand for those who wish to eyeball the ebb and flow of relative volatility.

- en: In fact, [Bollinger Band width](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Bollinger%20band%20width)
    is a way to measure one type of historical volatility statistically rather than
    to rely on a chart and I have used this measure on the blog (see link above for
    examples) on several occasions to measure volatility.

- en: Regarding predictive value of Bollinger Bands, I find that they can be a useful
    indicator – notably with the VIX – and increase in their predictive the more standard
    deviations the VIX is from the mean. While October and November 2008 were not
    good times to employ this strategy, for the most part, I believe Bollinger Bands
    usually provide some helpful information about the likelihood of mean reversion.

- en: Finally, there are some traders who prefer to play the volatility trend instead
    of using a mean reversion approach. Volatility trend traders might do something
    opening and maintaining long positions when a stock is trading between +1.0 and
    +2.0 standard deviations above the mean and closing those positions when the Bollinger
    Band lines are violated.

    own book on the subject (see above) is a probably the last word on the matter.
    Readers are also encouraged to check out a three-part series on three important
    parameters of Bollinger Bands that I posted a little over a year ago:'
