    burst.

- en: I suppose he is referring to the 2005 revision to Irrational Exuberance, where
    he has a chapter on housing. A bunch of information, and concern, but no real
    call that housing was ready to decline. Lots of qualifiers.

- en: The bubble in housing prices that began in the late 1990s shows signs of slowing
    down in some cities. But it is not at all clear when it will be over. Slowdowns
    can be reversed, and prices can take off again...

- en: In cities where prices have gotten so high that many people cannot afford to
    live there, the price increases may start to slowdown, and then to fall. At the
    same time, it is likely the boom will continue for quite a while in other cities.

    over the next year, and some may go bankrupt.
