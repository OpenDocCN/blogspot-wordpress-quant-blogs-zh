    we introduced the S&P500 Economic Forecasting Model which seeks to predict the
    chances of a moderate or large drawdown over the next 90 days. The model considers
    a large range of different macroeconomic variables and their derivatives to assess
    the likelihood of a given event. What the model can do is identify when there
    are signs of economic weakness that may or may not be reflected in the current
    market price. What the model cannot do is identify sentiment, liquidity, or news
    driven corrections (ie the Donald Trump effect). Currently the model is waiting
    on several new pieces of data before making a new prediction. The table below
    shows the model predictions using “point-in-time” data as of the first day of
    the respective month. Here is the current and historical output:'

- en: The most recent prediction which was made as of the beginning of March shows
    that the model does not expect a moderate to large correction through the end
    of May. The direction of the market is expected to be sideways or flat. So from
    a macroeconomic perspective it seems as if the economy is healthy for the time
    being. Absent any major news events or tweets and the economy is likely to keep
    chugging along and the stock market will probably remain in a trading range before
    climbing higher. If you look at the historical predictions they have been fairly
    accurate in recent times and provide some guidance of when it might be worthwhile
    buying on weakness (during December 2018) by looking at both the chance of a drawdown
    and the predicted market direction. While the model was created without running
    backtests, we will show some applications of using the signals for timing the
    S&P500.
