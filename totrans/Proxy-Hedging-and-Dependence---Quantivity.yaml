    senior folks from numerous big banks reduced it to correlation: hedge using an
    instrument whose correlation is close to -1\. This perspective matches the popular
    practitioner literature, such as recently published text [Hedging Market Exposures](http://books.google.com/books?id=CpSv76NCmJcC)
    (Bychuk and Haughey, 2011). Moreover, this perspective is at the heart of much
    of the research literature, going back to original definition of optimal hedge
    ratio ![\hat{\beta}](img/bf55cafee1613728641a3fb0910e4efd.png) (*e.g.* [Hull](http://books.google.com/books?id=sEmQZoHoJCcC),
