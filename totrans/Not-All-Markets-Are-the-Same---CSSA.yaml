- en: The search for robust systems  is the focus of serious research for system developers
    and academics. Defining robustness is a dicey semantic discussion, but for this
    post we will define it as a measure the ability of a variable or system to perform
    well across either a spectrum of uncorrelated markets and/or across time through
    different regimes. There is a tremendous amount of intellectual appeal and academic
    support for this concept. If forced to make a choice, I would say that this is
    the easiest way to ensure that a system will function well out of sample.

    across multiple markets and stocks, I can honestly say that there are truly a
    great deal of idiosyncracies in how different vehicles behave. Gold does not behave
    like the S&P500—it never has, and the differences are substantial. Oil does not
    behave like Gold or the S&P500, again substantial differences. This brings the
    interesting conclusion that if such large markets can behave so differently despite
    sharing common sources of investment flows, it stands to reason that smaller markets
    or individual stocks may have even more divergent behavior. In fact this is actually
    true—the stock market is like a great rainforest of different species in this
    respect. Smaller cap stocks have such unique and bizarre behavior that it is unfair
    to even place them in a sector or category.

    searching for robust effects across stocks or markets is actually caused by real
    systematic differences between markets, and therefore many ideas that we discard
    would in fact show significant promise after controlling for it. In fact, I am
    told by a friend in the drug business that this is a serious issue with clinical
    trials because many different types of people respond poorly to drugs that work
    on most of the population. Thus if representative samples are not chosen for trials,
    a valuable drug can be rejected because of patient side effects that were not
    systematic but rather idiosyncratic. 2) Instead of searching for something that
    works on everything all the time, you can find a style that suits you and simply
    trade that on stocks that you find predictable–or use a systematic method that
    can identify such stocks/markets.

- en: The **Livermore Index** is but one simple example—it is NOT just a list of high
    momentum stocks, ***it is also a list of stocks that have a historical tendency
    to trend in a meaningful way***.  That is the secret sauce–not the relative strength
    algorithm which is elegant but ultimately fairly simple. In fact if you were to
    test DV2 or RSI2 on the top 10 Livermore stocks, you will find that you lose money
    over a 10 year period!   Surprisingly this same factor works across global markets
    and stocks—–it is a universal factor used to identify a very specific idiosyncracy.
    This means that if you wanted to trade these stocks using a 5-day or 10-day breakout,
    that would be a winning system. If you have a trend trader mentality then this
    is your dream situation in an increasing mean-reversion dominated marketplace.
    Heck even a 1-day breakout on these stocks is highly profitable with an exit on
    the first down day.

    ***If in a large index like the Nasdaq 100 we can identify the stocks most likely
    to follow through then we should be able to identify the stocks most likely to
    mean-revert. Therefore, given knowledge of the the current relative proportion
    of stocks that follow through that have risen/fallen today and the relative proportion
    of mean-reverting stocks that have risen/fallen today—we can predict more accurately
     whether the index itself is likely to follow through or mean revert. If we can
    do this for the Nasdaq 100, we can do this for any aggregate index whether it
    is the S&P500 or ANY sector or country ETF.***'

- en: This my friends, is the next generation of breadth research—the old generation
    is indirect and often multicollinear with measures of  the index movement in isolation.
    That is not to say that breadth measures are not reliable—because they actually
    do a better job of predicting market turns at extremes. It is to say that on a
    day to day basis—breadth is not that accurate *after controlling for index effects*,
    and it has nothing to do with the concept or variable itself. It has to do with
    the noise embedded in the effects I just mentioned. It has to do with the fact
    that not all stocks or markets are the same.
