- en: The search for robust systems  is the focus of serious research for system developers
    and academics. Defining robustness is a dicey semantic discussion, but for this
    post we will define it as a measure the ability of a variable or system to perform
    well across either a spectrum of uncorrelated markets and/or across time through
    different regimes. There is a tremendous amount of intellectual appeal and academic
    support for this concept. If forced to make a choice, I would say that this is
    the easiest way to ensure that a system will function well out of sample.

  zh: 寻找健壮系统是系统开发者和学者们认真研究的焦点。定义健壮性是一场充满风险的语义讨论，但在这篇文章中，我们将把它定义为衡量一个变量或系统在非相关市场光谱上表现良好，或在不同制度下随时间表现良好的能力。这个概念有着巨大的智力吸引力和学术支持。如果被迫做出选择，我会说这是确保系统样本外表现良好的最简单方法。
- en: BUT……the truth is, not all markets are the same. After a great deal of research
    across multiple markets and stocks, I can honestly say that there are truly a
    great deal of idiosyncracies in how different vehicles behave. Gold does not behave
    like the S&P500—it never has, and the differences are substantial. Oil does not
    behave like Gold or the S&P500, again substantial differences. This brings the
    interesting conclusion that if such large markets can behave so differently despite
    sharing common sources of investment flows, it stands to reason that smaller markets
    or individual stocks may have even more divergent behavior. In fact this is actually
    true—the stock market is like a great rainforest of different species in this
    respect. Smaller cap stocks have such unique and bizarre behavior that it is unfair
    to even place them in a sector or category.

  zh: 但是……真相是，并非所有市场都相同。在对多个市场和股票进行了大量研究之后，我可以诚实地告诉你，不同工具的行为方式确实存在许多独特性。黄金不像标普500——它从未像过，差异是巨大的。石油不像黄金或标普500，同样差异显著。这带来了一个有趣的结论，如果如此大的市场能够在共享的共同投资流动源的情况下行为如此不同，那么小型市场或个别股票可能有更加分歧的行为。实际上确实如此——在这一点上，股市就像一个巨大的雨林，里面有不同的物种。小市值股票有如此独特和奇怪的行为，以至于甚至不公平地将它们归入某个部门或类别。
- en: This has some interesting implications– 1) a lot of the “noise” we see when
    searching for robust effects across stocks or markets is actually caused by real
    systematic differences between markets, and therefore many ideas that we discard
    would in fact show significant promise after controlling for it. In fact, I am
    told by a friend in the drug business that this is a serious issue with clinical
    trials because many different types of people respond poorly to drugs that work
    on most of the population. Thus if representative samples are not chosen for trials,
    a valuable drug can be rejected because of patient side effects that were not
    systematic but rather idiosyncratic. 2) Instead of searching for something that
    works on everything all the time, you can find a style that suits you and simply
    trade that on stocks that you find predictable–or use a systematic method that
    can identify such stocks/markets.

  zh: 这有一些有趣的含义——1)当我们寻找在股票或市场之间持久的健壮效应时，我们看到的“噪音”实际上是由市场之间的真实系统差异引起的，因此许多我们丢弃的想法实际上在控制这些差异后会有显著的潜力。事实上，我的一位在药物行业的的朋友告诉我，这是临床试验的一个严重问题，因为许多不同类型的人对作用于大多数人口的药物反应不佳。因此，如果未选择代表性的样本进行试验，一种有价值的药物可能会因为患者的非系统性副作用而被拒绝。2)与其寻找一直对所有事物都有效的东西，你可以找到一种适合你的风格，仅仅在你觉得可预测的股票上交易——或者使用可以识别这类股票/市场的系统方法。
- en: The **Livermore Index** is but one simple example—it is NOT just a list of high
    momentum stocks, ***it is also a list of stocks that have a historical tendency
    to trend in a meaningful way***.  That is the secret sauce–not the relative strength
    algorithm which is elegant but ultimately fairly simple. In fact if you were to
    test DV2 or RSI2 on the top 10 Livermore stocks, you will find that you lose money
    over a 10 year period!   Surprisingly this same factor works across global markets
    and stocks—–it is a universal factor used to identify a very specific idiosyncracy.
    This means that if you wanted to trade these stocks using a 5-day or 10-day breakout,
    that would be a winning system. If you have a trend trader mentality then this
    is your dream situation in an increasing mean-reversion dominated marketplace.
    Heck even a 1-day breakout on these stocks is highly profitable with an exit on
    the first down day.

  zh: '** Livermore指数**只是一个简单的例子——它不仅仅是高动量股票的列表，**它同时也是一份历史上倾向于以有意义的方式波动的股票的列表**。这就是秘密所在——而不是那个优雅但最终相对简单的相对强度算法。事实上，如果你要对DV2或RSI2在
    Livermore排名前10的股票上进行测试，你会发现你在10年的时间里会亏损！令人惊讶的是，这个相同的因素在全球市场和股票上都有效——它是一个用于识别一个非常特定的特质的普遍因素。这意味着，如果你想要使用5天或10天突破来交易这些股票，那将是一个赢利系统。如果你有一个趋势交易的心态，那么在
    increasingly mean-reversion主导的市场中，这就是你梦寐以求的情况。即使这些股票的1天突破也是非常盈利的，在第一天下跌时退出。'
- en: 'Now here is where it gets interesting and a little bit like a puzzle in astrophysics:
    ***If in a large index like the Nasdaq 100 we can identify the stocks most likely
    to follow through then we should be able to identify the stocks most likely to
    mean-revert. Therefore, given knowledge of the the current relative proportion
    of stocks that follow through that have risen/fallen today and the relative proportion
    of mean-reverting stocks that have risen/fallen today—we can predict more accurately
     whether the index itself is likely to follow through or mean revert. If we can
    do this for the Nasdaq 100, we can do this for any aggregate index whether it
    is the S&P500 or ANY sector or country ETF.***'

  zh: 现在让我们来谈谈这个话题，它有点像天体物理学中的谜题：**如果在像纳斯达克100这样的大型指数中我们可以识别出最可能持续的股票，那么我们应该能够识别出最可能均值回归的股票。因此，在了解了今天上涨/下跌的股票中跟随股票的比例和今天上涨/下跌的均值回归股票的比例之后——我们可以更准确地预测指数本身是可能持续还是均值回归。如果我们能够对纳斯达克100做到这一点，我们就可以对任何聚合指数做到这一点，无论是标普500还是任何板块或国家ETF。**
- en: This my friends, is the next generation of breadth research—the old generation
    is indirect and often multicollinear with measures of  the index movement in isolation.
    That is not to say that breadth measures are not reliable—because they actually
    do a better job of predicting market turns at extremes. It is to say that on a
    day to day basis—breadth is not that accurate *after controlling for index effects*,
    and it has nothing to do with the concept or variable itself. It has to do with
    the noise embedded in the effects I just mentioned. It has to do with the fact
    that not all stocks or markets are the same.

  zh: 朋友们，这就是下一代宽度研究的诞生——上一代研究是间接的，通常与指数运动的孤立测量多相关。这并不是说宽度测量不可靠——因为它们实际上在预测市场在极端情况下的转变方面做得更好。这是说，在每天的基础上——宽度在**控制指数效应**之后并不是那么准确，这与概念或变量本身无关。这与我刚才提到的效应中嵌入的噪音有关。这与所有股票或市场都不是一样的的事实有关。
