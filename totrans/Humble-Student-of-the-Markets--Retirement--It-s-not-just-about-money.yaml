    is). However, neo-classical economists have tended to focus on wealth creation
    as a source of growth for an economy. As good quantitative analysts know, optimizing
    a system based on a single factor can lead to unforeseen results (and possible
    policy mistakes).

    families is the problem of instilling proper values in their children and how
    to teach them the value of a dollar. We saw that in spades during the dot com
    era when 20-somethings and 30-somethings working stiffs became multi-millionaires
    overnight. What message are you sending the kids when you can hop on the private
    jet and fly to St. Moritz for Spring Break? Do you let each of your children bring
    a friend along? What message does it send to your kids' friends and your neighbors?

    physically taxing, retirement is not something we tend to embrace. But most people
    are not so lucky. Even if they like their jobs it, the work may be too physically
    demanding to continue into old age. A colleague of mine was often told by his
    father, “Get an education so you can get a job where you use your brain; it’s
    the best insurance against getting injured.”

- en: As we live progressively longer we must also rethink our retirement expectations.
    Retiring at the same age that your parents did, or earlier, can no longer be the
    expectation, or at least not at the rate we are saving. True, working to age 70
    will be tough or impossible for some people and it is expensive for employers.
    Meanwhile, part of the justification for a later retirement age is longer life
    expectancy, but low income people who worked in hard labour often die younger.
    In principle we could index the normal retirement age to different demographic
    life expectancy—so people will have different ages when they can collect full
    Social Security. But politically that would be a mess, especially because mortality
    rates are so race-specific. That's why retirement may need to come to mean something
    different than it currently does. Retirement may not be an abrupt exit from the
    labour force, but a slow phase out starting with part-time work.
