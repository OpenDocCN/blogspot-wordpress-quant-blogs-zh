    requirements are heavy C#/WinForms experience, architectural skills, and a small
    understanding of finance. In my old job, I probably interviewed at least 100 people
    for 2 similar positions, and we could not get a decent hit. The client ended up
    hiring a .NET superstar away from one of the Wall Street brokerage houses.
