- en: 'Nick Maouis, the founder of Amaranth, claims that the 6-billion dollar loss
    that his fund suffers is due to a “highly improbable” event in the natural gas
    market. Some analysts have thrown doubts on this claim. To see how improbable
    this loss is, let’s take a quick look at the historical performance of this trade
    since 2000\. This is not only of forensic (and perhaps legal) interest: if Mr.
    Maouis’ claim were true, it would have furnished us a glimpse of a potentially
    highly profitable trading strategy.'

- en: The bet that Amaranth and its head trader Brian Hunter made is that the March-over-April
    spread in natural gas futures will increase in value throughout the year prior
    to the contract expiration. Unfortunately for their investors, the spread decreases
    rather than increases in September, resulting in a $6 billion drop in value. We
    don’t know the exact time when Amaranth bought this spread. However, it is likely
    that they have started buying in April of this year. April is the time when the
    nation’s natural gas storage inventory coming out of the winter is known and thus
    provides a foundation to bet on next winter’s natural gas sufficiency. I plotted
    below the profit-or-loss of buying this spread (long one March contract of the
    following year, and short one April contract) in April and exiting the position
    at the end of September every year since 2000\. (Click on the graph twice to make
    it bigger.)

    that this trade was very profitable is 2005: it made more than $16,000 profit
    per pair of contracts. This is consistent with a Wall Street Journal report that
    Mr. Hunter made $1 billion for Amaranth in 2005\. That was indeed due to an improbable
    event last year: Hurricane Katrina.'

- en: Note also from the 2006 graph that, consistent with news reports, the trade
    was actually quite profitable up till the beginning of September. This paper profit
    may not be easily realized by Mr. Hunter though, since a lot of it may be due
    to his aggressively increasing his position and driving up the market.

- en: Now there can be several objections to my analysis. You might think that if
    we hold on to this spread position longer, say till December, it would have been
    more profitable historically. My research shows otherwise. Holding till December
    would have resulted in losing 4 out of the previous 5 years, losing even in 2005\.
    You might also argue that this is an extremely simplistic version of Mr. Hunter’s
    strategy. No doubt Mr. Hunter used various complex options strategies, continuously
    adjusted with various fundamental factors such as weather prediction and natural
    gas inventory reports as inputs. However, from a risk management point of view,
    the portfolio that Mr. Hunter owns seems highly correlated to a plain vanilla
    spread position that I described. The fact that this plain vanilla position loses
    money half the time historically would not have been reassuring.

    that do have a much better profit consistency.
