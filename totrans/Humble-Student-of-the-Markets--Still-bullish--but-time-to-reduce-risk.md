# Humble Student of the Markets: Still bullish, but time to reduce risk

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2019/02/still-bullish-but-time-to-reduce-risk.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2019/02/still-bullish-but-time-to-reduce-risk.html#0001-01-01)

**Preface: Explaining our market timing models**

We maintain several market timing models, each with differing time horizons. The "

**Ultimate Market Timing Model**

" is a long-term market timing model based on the research outlined in our post,

[Building the ultimate market timing model](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2016/01/26/building-the-ultimate-market-timing-model/)

. This model tends to generate only a handful of signals each decade.

The

**Trend Model**

is an asset allocation model which applies trend following principles based on the inputs of global stock and commodity price. This model has a shorter time horizon and tends to turn over about 4-6 times a year. In essence, it seeks to answer the question, "Is the trend in the global economy expansion (bullish) or contraction (bearish)?"

My inner trader uses a

**trading model**

, which is a blend of price momentum (is the Trend Model becoming more bullish, or bearish?) and overbought/oversold extremes (don't buy if the trend is overbought, and vice versa). Subscribers receive real-time alerts of model changes, and a hypothetical trading record of the those email alerts are updated weekly

[here](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/trading-track-record/)

. The hypothetical trading record of the trading model of the real-time alerts that began in March 2016 is shown below.

The latest signals of each model are as follows:

*   Ultimate market timing model: Sell equities*
*   Trend Model signal: Neutral*
*   Trading model: Bullish*

.

**Take some chips off the table**

Don't get me wrong. I haven't turned bearish. The US equity market is no longer wildly cheap. The current forward P/E is now 16.2, which is between its 5-year average of 16.4 and 10-year average of 14.6\. It is a far cry from the sub-14 multiple seen at the December lows.

When I turned bullish in mid-January 2019 (see

[A rare "what's my credit card limit" buy signal](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2019/01/07/a-rare-what-my-credit-card-limit-buy-signal/)

and 

[Ursus Interruptus](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2019/01/13/ursus-interruptus/)

), my model portfolio became overweight equities in the snapback rally. Its equity weight would have drifted to either the top or above its asset allocation range. Now that the market is no longer cheap, it is time to trim equity weights back to a more neutral position.

This is not a bearish call. The US stock market is not going to crash, and it should be higher a year from now. This is just a call to reduce risk, and near-term risk levels are rising. Looking to the next few months, a number of risks have appeared.

*   Rising financial stress
*   Weak market internals and negative divergences
*   US-China trade deal blowback
*   USD strength is a threat to stock prices

**A Special Announcement**

We told you so. We told you the market was going down.

Here is the track of

***Humble Student of the Markets***

, where we are neither perma-bulls nor perma-bears. Most recently, we have been correctly bullish since the correction of 2015, and turned cautious in August 2018 (see

[Market top ahead? My inner investor turns cautious,](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.com/2018/08/05/major-top-ahead-my-inner-investor-turns-cautious/)

August 5, 2018).

We were also timely at the 2009 bottom. We issued a call to buy beaten up low-priced stocks with high insider buying a week before the ultimate bottom (see

[Phoenix rising?](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2009/02/phoenix-rising.html)

 February 24, 2009).

***The out-of-sample record of our model trading portfolio in 2018 was up 42.9%***

. For more details, see our weekly updates
