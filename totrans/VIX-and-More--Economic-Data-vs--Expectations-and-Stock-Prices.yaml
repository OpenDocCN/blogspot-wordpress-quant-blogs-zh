- en: For the last year I have been posting charts of the trends in various economic
    data reports versus consensus expectations. The last time around, in [Continued
    Lackluster Data vs. Expectations](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2011/04/continued-lackluster-economic-data-vs.html),
    I commented that the April data indicated “manufacturing and employment are no
    longer providing positive surprises relative to expectations, while data related
    to the consumer reflect consumer activity that is plodding at best.”

    missing expectations over the course of the last four weeks. In fact, the four
    weeks leading up to tomorrow’s employment report is the worst four week stretch
    relative to expectations since I began tabulating the data in this format at the
    beginning of 2010.

    not to break out the data into five groups (manufacturing/general, housing/construction,
    employment, consumer and prices/inflation) as I have done in the past. Instead,
    the chart below shows just the aggregate data relative to expectations plotted
    against the SPX on a weekly basis, going back to the beginning of 2010.

    correlated over the course of the past 1 ½ years, with a very minor lag time,
    if any. Not surprisingly, the recent data trend has been down sharply. It remains
    to be seen whether this is a temporary hiccup as the full extent of the Japan
    disruption is revealed or whether the global economy now has some large structural
    headwinds. Certainly the recent decoupling of data and stocks is unusual – and
    may come to a head tomorrow morning.
