**Mid-week market update**

: Last weekend, I wrote that while I was intermediate term bullish, I expected some equity market weakness early in the week. The hourly RSI-5 had exceeded 90, which is an extremely overbought reading, which was not sustainable. Even during the January melt-up, such episodes resolved themselves with either a pullback or sideways consolidation. The downside risk is the 50 day moving average (dma) and the gap that was created when the market rallied on March 9, 2018.

Now that the market has declined to test the 50 dma, and the gap is filled, what now?
