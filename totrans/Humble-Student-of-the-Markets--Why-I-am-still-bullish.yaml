    is not last summer but late October. And because, near the end of December, the
    Dow averages rose above their late-October highs, both Schannep and Moroney believe
    that the Dow Theory is solidly in the bullish camp — notwithstanding where the
    Dow transports might be relative to their July high.

    in an intermediate bull phase. During this consolidation period, doubts will appear
    about the legitimacy of the bull leg, as they are now. My view is that the next
    major move is up, but I am watching and open to the possibility that I am wrong
    and a correction can run deeper than I expect.
