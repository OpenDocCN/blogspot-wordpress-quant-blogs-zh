    [chart of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week).
    There was the rally in the [euro](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/euro),
    some positive debt offerings in [Spain](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Spain),
    new highs in [gold](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/gold), [BP](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/BP)’s
    $20 billion escrow fund, etc. On the volatility front, the last week was the first
    time ever that the VIX fell more than 15% in consecutive weeks.

    the most compelling was the course the United States Golfing Association assembled
    this week at [Pebble Beach](http://www.pebblebeach.com/) to test the world’s best
    golfers in the world for the [U.S. Open](http://www.usopen.com/en_US/index.html)
    championship.

    difficult greens and the U.S. Open’s notoriously long and unforgiving rough were
    such that not one of the 156 golfers was able to break par. In keeping with tradition,
    the U.S. Open course was set up to extract the maximum penalty for any missed
    shot.

    golfer was able to make, but by how well he was able to avoid trouble. The scorecards
    of the top three finishers tell the story and together comprise this week’s chart
    of the week. In the end, the winner, [Graeme McDowell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graeme_McDowell),
    persevered by not allowing the course to bully him into anything worse than a
    bogey. Runner-up [Gregory Havret](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%A9gory_Havret)
    had only one double bogey on his scorecard, but it was just enough to keep him
    one stroke back from McDowell. Third place finisher [Ernie Els](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernie_Els),
    who plays with the demeanor of someone who is always unflappable, ended up with
    two double bogeys and finished two strokes back. In the end, it was the disastrous
    double bogeys – and one’s ability to avoid them – that spelled the difference.

- en: The reason the Pebble Beach odyssey stuck in my mind is that it reminded me
    that traders should approach trading the way they would approach a golf course
    like Pebble Beach. The goal should be to play for pars and look to capitalize
    on any birdie opportunities that arise. To the extent possible, this means keeping
    the ball away from hazards and obstacles, as well as avoiding low percentage plays.
    It also means not compounding small mistakes by pressing and trying to make up
    lost shots in a hurry. Impulsive play is almost always penalized; patience and
    discipline are the only way to survive.

    than to hit it 300 yards and not control where it is going. Consistency, precision,
    patience and opportunistic aggression. That is the recipe for winning golf and
    winning trading – at Pebble Beach or in your own back yard.
