- en: I was pulled in quite a few different directions when considering this week’s
    [chart of the week](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week).
    There was the rally in the [euro](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/euro),
    some positive debt offerings in [Spain](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Spain),
    new highs in [gold](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/gold), [BP](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/BP)’s
    $20 billion escrow fund, etc. On the volatility front, the last week was the first
    time ever that the VIX fell more than 15% in consecutive weeks.

  zh: 在考虑这周的[图表](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/chart%20of%20the%20week)时，我被迫关注了许多不同的方向。欧元[反弹](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/euro)，西班牙[国债](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/Spain)的积极发行，黄金[创新高](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/gold)，[BP](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/BP)的200亿美元托管基金等。在波动性方面，上周是VIX连续几周下跌超过15%的第一次。
- en: Of all the things that stuck in my mind this week, however, the one I found
    the most compelling was the course the United States Golfing Association assembled
    this week at [Pebble Beach](http://www.pebblebeach.com/) to test the world’s best
    golfers in the world for the [U.S. Open](http://www.usopen.com/en_US/index.html)
    championship.

  zh: 然而，在我脑海中留下最深印象的，是本周美国高尔夫协会在[Pebble Beach](http://www.pebblebeach.com/)组织的课程，用以测试世界上最好的高尔夫球手参加[美国公开赛](http://www.usopen.com/en_US/index.html)冠军赛。
- en: While this was a relatively short course, the challenges posed by natural obstacles,
    difficult greens and the U.S. Open’s notoriously long and unforgiving rough were
    such that not one of the 156 golfers was able to break par. In keeping with tradition,
    the U.S. Open course was set up to extract the maximum penalty for any missed
    shot.

  zh: 虽然这是一个相对较短的球场，但自然障碍、难缠的果岭以及美国公开赛臭名昭著的长草区的挑战如此之大，以至于没有一名156名高尔夫球手能够打破标准杆。按照传统，美国公开赛的球场被设置为对任何失球进行最大惩罚。
- en: In fact, as I see it, the championship was decided not by how many birdies a
    golfer was able to make, but by how well he was able to avoid trouble. The scorecards
    of the top three finishers tell the story and together comprise this week’s chart
    of the week. In the end, the winner, [Graeme McDowell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graeme_McDowell),
    persevered by not allowing the course to bully him into anything worse than a
    bogey. Runner-up [Gregory Havret](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%A9gory_Havret)
    had only one double bogey on his scorecard, but it was just enough to keep him
    one stroke back from McDowell. Third place finisher [Ernie Els](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernie_Els),
    who plays with the demeanor of someone who is always unflappable, ended up with
    two double bogeys and finished two strokes back. In the end, it was the disastrous
    double bogeys – and one’s ability to avoid them – that spelled the difference.

  zh: 实际上，在我看来，比赛的胜负并不在于高尔夫球手能做出多少小鸟球，而在于他如何能够有效地避开麻烦。前三名完成者的计分卡讲述了故事，并共同构成了这周的图表。最后，冠军[Graeme
    McDowell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graeme_McDowell)坚持不懈，不让球场将他逼得比柏忌更差。亚军[Gregory
    Havret](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%A9gory_Havret)的计分卡上只有一个双柏忌，但这足以让他比McDowell少一杆。季军[Ernie
    Els](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernie_Els)，一个总是从容不迫的人，最终有两个双柏忌，比McDowell多两杆。最后，灾难性的双柏忌——以及避免它们的能力——决定了胜负。
- en: The reason the Pebble Beach odyssey stuck in my mind is that it reminded me
    that traders should approach trading the way they would approach a golf course
    like Pebble Beach. The goal should be to play for pars and look to capitalize
    on any birdie opportunities that arise. To the extent possible, this means keeping
    the ball away from hazards and obstacles, as well as avoiding low percentage plays.
    It also means not compounding small mistakes by pressing and trying to make up
    lost shots in a hurry. Impulsive play is almost always penalized; patience and
    discipline are the only way to survive.

  zh: Pebble Beach奥德赛之所以留在我的脑海中，是因为它让我意识到交易者应该像对待Pebble Beach这样的高尔夫球场一样对待交易。目标应该是以标准杆为目标，并寻求利用任何出现的小鸟球机会。尽可能地这意味着让球远离危险和障碍，以及避免低概率的打法。这也意味着不要通过急于追分来加剧小错误，冲动的打法几乎总是受到惩罚；耐心和纪律是生存的唯一途径。
- en: In golf and in trading, it is better to be able to drive the ball into the fairway
    than to hit it 300 yards and not control where it is going. Consistency, precision,
    patience and opportunistic aggression. That is the recipe for winning golf and
    winning trading – at Pebble Beach or in your own back yard.

  zh: 在高尔夫和交易中，能将球打入球道比把它打300码远但不控制球的去向要好。稳定性、精确性、耐心和机会主义的进攻性。这是在Pebble Beach获胜或在你自家的后院获胜的高尔夫和交易秘诀。
