    "What Factors Drive the Performance of Momentum Strategies? (Part 1)") of the
    series we introduced a three-factor model that decomposes momentum profitability
    and how that can be translated into a momentum score for an asset universe. In
    this post we will show how momentum strategies can be profitable even under the
    conditions where the market is efficient and time series performance is not predictable.

    series predictability (T) 2) dispersion in mean returns (D) and 3) the existence
    of lead/lag relationships (L). The score is computed by adding T and D and subtracting
    out the value of L. More formally, we would take the average auto-covariance across
    time series, the variance in cross-sectional mean returns and the average cross-serial
    auto-covariance between asset returns.'

    should follow a random walk and hence should not be predictable using past prices
    (or any form of technical analysis). The next period price in this context is
    a function of the current price plus a random distribution output with a mean
    and error term. Whether this theory is in fact true based upon the empirical evidence
    is not a subject that I will address in this article. Instead, what I personally
    found more interesting was to determine whether the presence of an efficient market
    would still permit a momentum strategy to be successful. The answer boils down
    to the formula that de-composes momentum profitability:'

    expect profits to a momentum strategy as long as there is dispersion in the asset
    means– in other words, we would require that the asset means be heterogeneous
    to some degree to capture momentum profits. Technically another requirement is
    that the asset means are fairly stationary– in other words they can drift over
    time but their means stay approximately the same. However, from a practical perspective
    many risk premiums are fairly stable over long periods of time (ie the return
    to investing in the stock market for example). Hence the existence of variation
    in asset returns alone can support the existence of momentum profits even if the
    market was considered to be efficient. This helps reconcile why Eugene Fama- the
    father of the Efficient Markets Hypothesis- can still claim that momentum is the
    “premier anomaly” and still not technically be a hypocrite (even though it sounds
    that way to many industry practitioners).

    momentum score using the formula presented above than a sector equity universe.
    This was demonstrated to be primarily due to the fact that the dispersion in asset
    means is much higher in an asset class universe than a sector universe. To add
    further to this result, we would expect that the mean returns for asset classes
    will be more stationary than the means for sectors or individual stocks since
    they reflect broad risk premiums rather than idiosyncratic or specific risk. As
    markets become more efficient over time and all assets become more unpredictable,
    the importance of cross-sectional dispersion in the means (and also mean stationarity)
    become essential to preserving momentum profits. The implication for investors
    is that the safest way to profit from a momentum strategy is to employ tactical
    asset allocation on an asset class universe in order to achieve greater consistency
    in returns over time.
