    field of expertise. I remember a sexuality professor arguing that all people are
    inherently bi-sexual to a significant degree. I thought, this may be her preference,
    but most of us are pretty hard wired towards a particular gender, and if she was
    a sex expert, she should know that. Obviously, she was projecting her vision of
    a societal nirvana, guilt-free sex with everyone. The list of such inanities is
    really quite long. Most nutritionists believed that a diet rich in fat is a major
    contributor to obesity, a finding now trumped by the initially derided Atkin’s
    claim that carbohydrates are more fat inducing; the American Medical Association
    declared that steroids had no affect on athletic performance; or finally that
    in the 1970s psychologists thought young delinquents had too little self-esteem,
    and now they think they have too much.

    a highly scientific rationale for their belief, and deflect criticism from 'conventional
    wisdom' because most people with mere common sense do not follow the academic
    protocol of the field that sets the standard for accepted expert opinion.

    long endure; but false views, if supported by some evidence, do little harm, as
    every one takes a salutary pleasure in proving their falseness.
