- en: The first day of a bounce can sometimes be a good indication of whether that
    bounce is likely to succeed or roll over. I recently showed an example of how
    a weak bounce (price-wise) can suggest a downside edge.

    about 90% of total NYSE volume during Tuesday’s selloff, today’s bounce higher
    only rebounded with about 56% up volume. I performed a study which looked at other
    times the market dropped at least 2% on over 85% down volume on day 1 and then
    rose on under 60% up volume on day 2.

    There was no discernable edge over this period of time, either. From 2001 through
    today it has triggered 14 times and consistently predicted downside. Below are
    some statistics on those instances:'
