    the New York Times reports that the tests were designed in part to "restore confidence
    in the overall health of the European financial system." This sounds a little

    by a European government, which is the single greatest risk facing the European
    banking sector at present,” Marie Diron, an economist who advises the consulting
    firm Ernst & Young, wrote in a note. “The publication of these results will not
    assuage investors’ fears over the resilience of the E.U. banking sector,” she
    wrote, referring to the European Union.
