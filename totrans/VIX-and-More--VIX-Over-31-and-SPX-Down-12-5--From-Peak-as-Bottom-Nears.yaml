- en: Calling [bottoms in the stock market](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/market%20bottoms)
    is part art and part science, but with the VIX closing over 31 today (up 35.4%
    to a close of 31.66) and the S&P 500 index having fallen 12.5% peak to trough
    from its early May high, the markets are likely nearing a bottom. Given that the
    SPX closed right at 1200, just above the intraday low, it is unreasonable to expect
    that a bottom is already in the books, but with today’s plunge, the process of
    finding a bottom has already begun.

  zh: 在股票市场中寻找底部是部分艺术和部分科学，但随着VIX今天收盘超过31（上涨35.4%，收于31.66），标普500指数从五月初的高点下跌了12.5%，市场可能正在接近底部。考虑到SPX收于1200点，仅略高于当日低点，期望底部已经确定是不合理的，但是随着今天的暴跌，寻找底部的过程已经开始。

    seem to be at least one step ahead of the European Central Bank and there are
    widespread signs that economic growth is slowing across the globe, but a number
    of market sentiment indicators and technical factors suggest that the selloff
    in the past week has been overdone and way too emotional, perhaps with a healthy
    dose of forced selling in the mix. For some perspective, ask yourself just how
    bad tomorrow’s jobs number will have to be to prevent at least a relief rally
    from starting tomorrow.

  zh: 当然，欧洲主权债务危机的问题似乎至少比欧洲央行领先一步，全球经济增长放缓的迹象普遍存在，但是许多市场情绪指标和技术因素表明，过去一周的抛售已经夸张并且过于情绪化，也许其中有一些迫使抛售的元素。为了获得一些透视，问问自己明天的就业数据将有多糟糕，以阻止至少明天开始的一场宽慰性反弹。
- en: As the table of SPX pullbacks below illustrates, the current selloff is the
    second sharpest in terms of magnitude since the bull market began in March 2009\.
    It is now the longest in terms of duration, spanning 66 trading days since the
    high of SPX 1370.

  zh: 正如下表所示，SPX回撤的表现，当前的抛售是自2009年3月牛市开始以来在幅度上第二大的。从持续时间上来看，这是历时最长的，自SPX 1370的高点以来已经持续了66个交易日。
- en: Those who want to initiate new long positions in this environment may wish to
    limit risk by using options (long calls, bull call spreads, bull put spreads,
    etc.), but the time has come for the contrarian in the asbestos suit to start
    at least nibbling on the long side. Those with a more cautious demeanor may prefer
    to wait for some better evidence of a technical bottom and perhaps even a confirmation
    of that bottom, but while buying at current prices may risk being a little early,
    there is also a good chance that today’s sale prices will not be around for long.

  zh: 那些希望在这种环境下建立新的多头头寸的人可能希望通过使用期权（多头期权、牛市买入价差、牛市卖出价差等）来限制风险，但现在是穿防护服的反向投资者开始至少在多头方向上稍作涉足的时候了。那些更加谨慎的人可能更愿意等待一些更好的技术底部迹象，甚至是该底部的确认，但是虽然以当前价格购买可能有些早，但今天的优惠价格也有很大可能不会持续太久。
