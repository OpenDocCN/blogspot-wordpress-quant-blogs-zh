- en: Calling [bottoms in the stock market](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/search/label/market%20bottoms)
    is part art and part science, but with the VIX closing over 31 today (up 35.4%
    to a close of 31.66) and the S&P 500 index having fallen 12.5% peak to trough
    from its early May high, the markets are likely nearing a bottom. Given that the
    SPX closed right at 1200, just above the intraday low, it is unreasonable to expect
    that a bottom is already in the books, but with today’s plunge, the process of
    finding a bottom has already begun.

    seem to be at least one step ahead of the European Central Bank and there are
    widespread signs that economic growth is slowing across the globe, but a number
    of market sentiment indicators and technical factors suggest that the selloff
    in the past week has been overdone and way too emotional, perhaps with a healthy
    dose of forced selling in the mix. For some perspective, ask yourself just how
    bad tomorrow’s jobs number will have to be to prevent at least a relief rally
    from starting tomorrow.

- en: As the table of SPX pullbacks below illustrates, the current selloff is the
    second sharpest in terms of magnitude since the bull market began in March 2009\.
    It is now the longest in terms of duration, spanning 66 trading days since the
    high of SPX 1370.

    limit risk by using options (long calls, bull call spreads, bull put spreads,
    etc.), but the time has come for the contrarian in the asbestos suit to start
    at least nibbling on the long side. Those with a more cautious demeanor may prefer
    to wait for some better evidence of a technical bottom and perhaps even a confirmation
    of that bottom, but while buying at current prices may risk being a little early,
    there is also a good chance that today’s sale prices will not be around for long.

    a personal note, this blog has been quiet for a while as family matters, a vacation
    and three new computers have competed for my attention. With volatility back on
    the front page, I will be posting again on a daily basis (at least) in order to
    offer my perspective on the current spike in volatility, some of its causes and
    the implications for trading.]*  ****Disclosure(s):** none**'
