- en: A desirable feature of a money manager is that when pairing the money manager
    and signal together, we have a return distribution with positive skew and very
    limited negative tails. ¬† We can even have a signal with < 50% wins, but because
    of the generated bias in + returns / ‚Äì returns, have an overall positive equity
    curve. ¬† Of course I would advocate for much a much higher win ratio than 50%

- en: I take the approach of having a trading signal that scales between [-1,1] or
    [0,1] on a continuous basis. ¬† In my trading systems the money manager not only
    works as a risk manager, but also decides how to scale the signal into a desired
    position.

    position from 0 to $5 million (if the signal reaches full power at 1). ¬†The 0

    ¬† Without regulation of how we map the signal to position size, the up and down
    dips in the signal would imply thrashing in and out of position, which would be
    costly.

    make it effective, one needs to be clever about deciding on whether a negative
    movement is a sign to get out or a transient movement. ¬† One can use a combination
    of signal, smoothed series, and aspects of order book and trade data to have a
    better read on this.
