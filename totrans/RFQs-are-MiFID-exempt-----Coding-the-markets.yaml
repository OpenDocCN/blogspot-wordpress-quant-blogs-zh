- en: “The benchmarking proposal could also create a dysfunctional market structure,
    says Liba. By promoting the use of e-trading systems to obtain the price data
    required for delivering and monitoring best execution, the proposal fails to recognise
    the importance of a voice market in the price formation process. This could lead
    to a distortion in the market in favour of dealing via an electronic “request
    for quote” model in an MTF market, which would not be required to deliver best
    execution under MiFID”

    line. Most RFQs are multi dealer, so the competition and price transparency keeps
    dealers honest online. But which price source would be used: [Bloomberg ](http://www.bloomberg.com)?
