    of economists, would have the Committee increase its medium-term inflation goals
    above levels consistent with price stability. ***I see no support for this option
    on the FOMC***. Conceivably, such a step might make sense in a situation in which
    a prolonged period of deflation had greatly weakened the confidence of the public
    in the ability of the central bank to achieve price stability, so that drastic
    measures were required to shift expectations. Also, in such a situation, higher
    inflation for a time, by compensating for the prior period of deflation, could
    help return the price level to what was expected by people who signed long-term
    contracts, such as debt contracts, before the deflation began.

    from the sorry history of continental Europe, where fat benefits and rigid firing
    rules dulled labour-market efficiency. That experience mostly offers pointers
    to what not to do, from adding to employers’ regulatory burdens to letting the
    long-term jobless shift to the disability rolls.

    could make unemployment worse. But two avenues seem worth pursuing. The first
    is a more determined effort to help those trapped in “negative equity” to restructure
    the mortgages on their homes—an area where the Obama administration has been notably
    timid. The dire figures for house sales during July, released this week, show
    how urgent this is. Legal changes, such as a revision to the bankruptcy code that
    allowed judges to reduce mortgage debt, could help. The second line of attack
    is to overhaul schemes that help workers retrain and encourage them to search
    for work. That need not mean more spending (though America does spend a lot less
    than other rich countries on such “active” labour-market policies). The bigger
    problem is that existing schemes are fragmented and often ineffective.
