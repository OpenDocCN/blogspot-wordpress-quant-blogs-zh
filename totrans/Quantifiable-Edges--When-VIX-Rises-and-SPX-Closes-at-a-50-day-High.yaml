- en: There were a few studies related to VIX action that appeared in the Quantifinder
    yesterday afternoon. This particular study looks at large mid-week rises in the
    VIX during times the SPX is closing at a 50-day high. All results are updated.

- en: New readers may wonder why I use a day-of-week filter with this study. The VIX
    has a natural tendency to fall on Fridays and rise on Mondays. Because of this
    I typically separate out those days from the rest of the week when conducting
    VIX-based studies. Implications of the rising VIX and 50-day SPX high appear to
    be moderately bearish over the next few days, suggesting a pullback.
