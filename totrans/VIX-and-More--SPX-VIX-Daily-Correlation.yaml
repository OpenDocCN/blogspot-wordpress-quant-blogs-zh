- en: Yesterday I offered up [some numbers](http://vixandmore.blogspot.com/2007/10/more-thoughts-and-numbers-on-spx-vix.html)
    to help describe the relationship between daily moves in the SPX and the VIX.  I
    hear quite a few observers comment along the lines of “the SPX was up(down) X%
    and yet the VIX was only down(up) Y%.”  Typically, the next action is to wonder
    aloud whether the corresponding VIX movement is ‘normal’ and whether any divergences
    might provide clues about the future direction of the markets.

    two ways to look at this.  The graph below plots daily percentage changes in the
    VIX against daily percentage changes in the SPX.  From the graphic, you can see
    that the relationship between the two is fairly linear for a SPX moving +/- 1.5%
    in a day.  Once the SPX moves outside of those bounds, however, the equations
    get a little messier.  Part of this, of course, is the accelerating fear factor
    that comes with extreme market moves.

    the typical VIX movement versus the SPX movement.  Readers are encouraged to ignore
    the valley around the zero (where strange things happen when you try to divide
    by zero) and focus instead on the fairly predictable ratio of the VIX to SPX that
    varies from about -2.5x to about -5.0x, depending upon the daily change in the
    SPX.

    provide reliable clues about the future direction of the market, I am going to
    address this more difficult question over the course of the lifetime of this blog.  I
    will offer this though: if I think I can simplify the answer in one concise post,
    I will do the best I can to communicate my thinking here.'
