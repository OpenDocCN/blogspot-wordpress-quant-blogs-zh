- en: recently wrote a terrific piece about the level of complacency in the current
    bout of stock market weakness. The SPX had fallen over 9% in two weeks, but the
    VIX Index was barely challenging its December highs and it was nowhere near the
    highs set during the August/September selloff.

    not respond in a corresponding fashion foreshadowed further stock market weakness.

- en: The Trifecta Bottom Model has been uncanny in spotting bottoms in the last three
    years. The chart below shows the record of this model in the last year, where
    the blue vertical lines indicate that two of the three components have been triggered
    (Exacta signal) and the red line indicates that all three were triggered. All
    marked short-term bottoms. The latest bout of stock market weakness saw TRIN hit
    a high of 1.97 (not quite 2.0) and the OBOS reach a low of 0.52 (not quite 0.5).
    Are these readings close enough to trigger a buy signal?
