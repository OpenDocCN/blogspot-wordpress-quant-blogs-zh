    action is strongly suggesting a strong short-term bounce should be at hand. Below
    is a short excerpt from Sunday night’s Subscriber Letter which puts some of my
    thoughts on these extremes into context.

- en: '*What needs to be kept in mind is that the price action over the last week
    has been more severe than at any time other than 1987 and then back to the 1930’s.
    In other words, while extreme readings in breadth, volatility, price, and volume
    indicators of this magnitude have almost always led to short-term upside over
    the periods tested, the current situation is far beyond most everything tested.
    Measures need to be taken to control risk. Tight stops are a possibility, but
    difficult to implement with such extreme volatility. I’m controlling risk by scaling
    in with reduced position size.*'
