# Magmasystems Blog: Cloudy Thinking

One of the things that has been on my

mind

recently is how to represent the "event cloud".

One of the

buzzphrases

that comes out of the

CEP

movement is the term "event cloud". This is the huge amalgamation of all of the events that flows through your event processing system.

This week, I had the opportunity to talk with Mary Knox of the

Gartner

Group. Mary follows the world of

CEP

. Just like many of the executives at the various

CEP

companies have told me, Mary confirms that many companies in finance are using

CEP

for simple streams of processing .... a small

algo

trading system here, a pricing engine there, a portfolio analysis system in another place. Most shops seem to be "under-utilizing" their

CEP

engines. Our effort is probably one of the few out there that will really attempt to poke holes in the hype surrounding

CEP

.... either our application will validate the hype, or all of the

CEP

engines will flame out in a blaze of glory.

Mary has not heard of too many financial companies who are implementing the event cloud, so I wonder if we are

breaking

new ground in that area. We know what an event cloud is and what it is supposed to do, but how do we actually implement the event cloud in a system like Coral8 or

Streambase

? Are relational tables/windows the best way to represent the cloud? And, what about hierarchies of events that are derived from other events? How can be best represent that complex graph of inter-relationships with

SQL

-

ish

windows?

Is anyone out there doing similar work with the cloud?
