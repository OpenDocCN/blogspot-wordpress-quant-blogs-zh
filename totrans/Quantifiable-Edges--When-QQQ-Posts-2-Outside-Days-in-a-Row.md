# Quantifiable Edges: When QQQ Posts 2 Outside Days in a Row

Tuesday marked the 2nd day in a row where the QQQ made a lower low and a higher high.  Days that do this are often referred to as “outside days” because they trade outside the range of the previous day.  When QQQ has posted back to back outside days in the past, it has often been followed by a short-term rally.  I last showed this in the 11/10/10 blog.  I posted a link to that blog via

yesterday afternoon.  I have updated the stats table below.

Results still appear strongly positive.
