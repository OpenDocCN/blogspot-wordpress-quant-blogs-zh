# Humble Student of the Markets: Time to buy gold and commodity stocks?

> 来源：[https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2013/02/time-to-buy-gold-and-commodity-stocks.html#0001-01-01](https://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2013/02/time-to-buy-gold-and-commodity-stocks.html#0001-01-01)

Last week, I wrote that traders looking for a correction should closely monitor the behavior of cyclical stocks (see

[Correction? Watch the cyclicals!](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2013/02/correction-watch-cyclicals.html)

). So far, cyclical stocks remain in a relative uptrend when compared to the market and their relative uptrend remains intact. There is no hint that a correction has begun.

What I do find unusual is that while the relative performance of cyclical stocks remain robust, the shares of commodity producers continue to lag. This is curious when resource stocks represent the most cyclically sensitive sectors of the stock market.

In addition, the price of gold is deflating despite the talk of currency wars. Gold is an alternate currency and should be a beneficiary under a scenario where global central banks engage in competitive devaluation. However, the price of gold is fallen so much that a dark cross, or

[death cross](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deathcross.asp#axzz2L8T3ecxi)

, is rapidly approaching.

**Commodity producers washed out**

In the past few months, gold stock investors have fared worse than holders of bullion. I have been a long advocate that gold bulls should hold bullion rather than the shares (see

[Where is the leverage to gold?](http://humblestudentofthemarkets.blogspot.com/2013/01/where-is-leverage-to-gold.html)

as one of many examples of previous posts on this topic). However, we may be approaching a point where traders could tactically favor gold stocks over bullion.

The graph below show the ratio of the Amex Gold Bugs Index (HUI) against the price of gold charted on a weekly basis. I have further overlaid a 14-week RSI on the top panel. Note that weekly RSI is now below 30 indicating an oversold reading. Past oversold readings have marked points where gold stocks have outperformed gold. In addition, the HUI/gold ratio is nearing the bottom of 2008, when investors dumped gold stocks in a bout of panic selling.

An analysis of the relative performance mining stocks show a similar pattern. Mining stocks are also approaching a key relative support level marked by the 2008 panic bottom.

These charts suggest to me that mining stocks are getting washed out and they are poised for a reversal in the months ahead.

Within the resource and commodity producing sector, energy stocks show a more constructive relative performance pattern. The chart below of the relative performance of this sector indicate that energy stocks have rallied through a relative downtrend line, i.e. they've stopped underperforming and a reversal may be close at hand.

Based on this analysis, my inner investor tells me that it is time to start accumulating positions in energy and mining. My inner trader, on the other hand, wants to dip his toe in the energy sector, play the golds for a bounce and wait for the relative reversal in mining before committing funds.
