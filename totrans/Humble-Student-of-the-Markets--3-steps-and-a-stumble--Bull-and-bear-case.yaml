    widely telegraphing their intentions. This morning's release of February CPI tells
    the story. Headline CPI is near a 5-year high. Though core CPI (ex-food and energy)
    edged down, the latest reading of 2.2% is above the Fed's 2% targeted inflation
    rate.

    when the Federal Reserve is tightening credit, Edson Gould, a legendary technical
    analyst from the 1930s through the 1970s, developed a simple rule about Federal
    Reserve policy that has an excellent record of foretelling a stock market decline.
    The rules states that "whenever the Federal Reserve raises either the federal
    funds target rate, margin requirements, or reserve requirements three consecutive
    times without a decline, the stock market is likely to suffer a substantial, perhaps
    serious, setback" (Schade, 2004). This simple rule is still relevants. Although
    it tends to lead a market top, it is something that should not be disregarded.

    the current economic cycle is elongated and shallow compared to past recoveries,
    and therefore it would be premature to worry about Fed actions to cool down the
    economy just yet.
