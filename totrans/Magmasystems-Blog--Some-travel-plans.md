# Magmasystems Blog: Some travel plans

I'll be at Microsoft in Redmond on January 25, 26 and 27\. If any of the Microsofties who read this blog would like to talk to me about capital markets, please send me an email.

From February 11 to 15th, I will be in Paris to see the 3-nights of concerts by Magma to celebrate their 40th anniversary. I don't even want to think about work and capital markets during those 5 days ... I will be searching for a bar that serves Absynthe, so if you have any recommendations, please let me know.
