    a little at the link between socioeconomic inequality and crime. That there is
    such a link has been established rather convincingly by statistical analyses across
    many nations spanning decades. This was all laid out convincingly in the 2009
    book

    that deserve some discussion. One is an idea in criminology known as "routine
    activity theory" which has increasingly become a branch of applied computational
    social science. In effect, it views crime as a kind of natural social chemistry
    taking place between potential offenders and targets, and has a good track record
    in accounting for empirical patterns of crimes of all kinds by considering simple
    factors such as patterns of human movement on streets, of street lighting, of
    building architecture and so on. It more or less gives up on thinking about the
    deep psychology of crime and its motivation. In general, this perspective asserts,
    you tend to get more crime where you have more targets coming together more frequently
    with more potential offenders, just as you get more chemical reactions whenever
    potential reactant molecules come into contact more frequently. I've written about
    this a little before in

    that factors such as poverty and social inequality don't matter in crime, as the
    theory doesn't explicitly consider such factors. This is a serious misunderstanding.
    After all, the theory focuses on the factors that bring together

    give a person the motivation to commit crime in the first place. Here the analogy
    to chemistry is again constructive, I think. In chemistry, reactants coming together
    isn't enough. They generally need sufficient energy (or a catalyst) to help them
    overcome an energy barrier (caused by repulsive forces between molecules) before
    they can react. It's entirely plausible to think of prevailing social norms as
    a kind of energy barrier to the commission of crimes, as these forces tend to
    persuade people to avoid crime. In general, we should expect high levels of trust
    and strong social norms to suppress and discourage crime, much as a lowering the
    temperature of a chemical solution makes reactions go more slowly. (Low temperature
    increases the effective size of energy barriers to reaction, which must be overcome
    by collisions between molecules; these are stronger at higher temperatures.)

    quite well with the existence of larger social factors that influence overall
    probabilities of crime. The factors considered in the theory can determine detailed
    patterns of crime, even as the larger global factors influence overall rates.
    The work considered by Wilkinson and Pickett strongly suggests that social inequality
    is one of the most important global factors encouraging crime (and other measures
    of social dysfunction).

    high levels of inequality in the first place. On the drivers of inequality, of
    course, there is a huge literature in social science and economics and I don't
    pretend to be an expert on it. However, there is an interesting perspective motivated
    by physics that I think should be much more widely known.

- en: from several years ago by Jean-Philippe Bouchaud and Marc Mezard analyses a
    very simple model of an economy and shows that a high level of economic inequality
    is a more or less generic and unavoidable outcome. It is something to be expected
    on mathematical grounds alone. The basic idea is to model an economy as a system
    in which wealth flows around among people by two fundamentally different processes.
    First, it flows between individuals when they make exchanges or trades, through
    contracts, employment, sales and so on. Second, wealth also accrues to individuals
    (or departs from them) on account of investments in instruments yielding uncertain
    returns. Importantly, the second factor contributes an element to individual wealth
    that involves a random multiplicative factor -- random because investments are
    uncertain, and multiplicative because, quite sensibly, the wealthier invest more
    than the poorer, and typically more in direct proportion to their wealth. The
    poor partake very weakly in this multiplicative channel to wealth growth, while
    the wealthy participate progressively more strongly.

- en: Bouchaud and Mezard showed that the inevitable outcome in such a basic system
    is that a large fraction of the total wealth in the economy ends up being held
    by a small faction of the population. This is the case even if every individual
    is considered to have the same inherent money making skills. (The authors, of
    course, do not believe this to be the case; but making this assumption makes it
    possible to explore how natural economic dynamics can drive large wealth disparities
    even in the absence of any differences in skill.) It's the multiplicative nature
    of the returns on investments that makes it happen. This pattern in the distribution
    of wealth holds in every nation and was known long ago, being first described
    by Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto. This paper gave to my knowledge the first
    really fundamental explanation of why this pattern holds everywhere. Since then
    a number of works have taken this approach much further.

    of some societies being more unequal than others. You can have a society in which
    the top 5% hold 90% of the wealth, or in which that same top 5% holds 99.9% of
    the wealth. Such variations are driven by the relative strength of multiplicative
    returns on investment versus the flows in an economy that might act to reduce
    inequality. Obviously, taxation is one mechanism that leads to a redistribution
    of wealth from richer to poorer and one should expect, in a broad brush way, that
    lower taxes should tend to associate with higher levels of wealth inequality.

    the mathematical detail -- as it shows how some very important global economic
    realities may have quite simple underlying causes. The bigger problem, of course,
    is learning then how to craft real world policies so as to keep inequality within
    bounds, avoiding the many kinds of social dysfunction it clearly seems to give
    rise to.
