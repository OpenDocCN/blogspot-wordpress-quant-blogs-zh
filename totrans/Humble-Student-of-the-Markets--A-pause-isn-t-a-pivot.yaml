    to pause interest rate increases. Even though the Fed raised rates by 25 basis
    points at the May meeting, it made an important change in its language from the
    March meeting, which stated:'

  zh: 美联储在其声明中做出了一个重要的改变，暗示它准备暂停加息。尽管美联储在五月会议上加息了25个基点，但它从三月会议的语言中做出了一个重要的改变，当时声明称：
- en: The Committee anticipates that some additional policy firming may be appropriate
    in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive
    to return inflation to 2 percent over time.

  zh: 委员会预计，为了达到足够严格的货币政策立场，以使通胀在一段时间内回归到2%，可能需要进行一些额外的政策收紧。

- en: Since the conclusion of the May meeting, the April Jobs Report came in mixed.
    While the headline increase in non-farm payroll employment was ahead of expectations,
    the figures for the previous two months were dramatically revised downward. The
    April CPI report came in slightly softer than expected. Headline YoY fell from
    5.0% to 4.9%, which was below market expectations, while core CPI was unchanged
    from the previous month at 5.5%. As well, PPI came in softer than expected. Overall,
    inflation has been slowly decelerating. The target Fed Funds rate of 5.00–5.25%
    is now above the core PCE rate of 4.2%. Historically, the Fed has kept the Fed
    Funds rate above its preferred inflation metric of core PCE whenever inflation
    has been above its 2% target.

  zh: 自五月会议结束以来，四月的就业报告喜忧参半。虽然非农就业人数的增长超出了预期，但前两个月的数字却被大幅向下修正。四月的CPI报告略低于预期。同比从5.0%降至4.9%，低于市场预期，而核心CPI与上个月持平，为5.5%。此外，PPI也低于预期。总体而言，通胀正在缓慢减速。目前的目标联邦基金利率5.00-5.25%已经高于核心PCE的4.2%。从历史上看，当通胀高于2%的目标时，美联储总是将联邦基金利率保持在它偏好的通胀指标——核心PCE之上。
