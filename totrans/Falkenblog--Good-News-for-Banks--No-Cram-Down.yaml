    the value of mortgages, and so helps banks, not merely directly via their mortgages,
    but indirectly as this would have hurt home prices. The specter of Cram-Down legislation
    surely has put a drag on mortgages, though it seems there are so many Federal
    plans outstanding, it is probably too much to get worked up about defeating one
    of them. Bad mortgage fixes these days are like dandelions in my yard.

- en: For unsecured debt like credit cards, or accounts payable, if you declare bankruptcy
    you can then go to court, and depending on your income and assets, the judge writes
    down your debts by 50% or 100%, depending on what seems feasible. After that judgment,
    credit card and other bills are simply no longer recoverable at par, but only
    at the new, lower amount. A home loan is a secured loan, meaning, the house is
    collateral that secures the loan. When you buy a house with a mortgage, the bank
    really owns the house until the mortgage is paid. It owns it in the sense that
    if you stop paying, they take the house back, just as if you stopped paying your
    auto loan your car would be repossessed. Historically, in conjunction with a large
    downpayment and good credit checks, this led to very small mortgage lending loss
    rates. As those paying mortgages have non-recourse loans, meaning the bank can
    only repossess the house and not go after other assets, the borrower has the option
    to walk away. Adding cram down means they would also have the option of writing
    down the mortgage.

- en: 'In banking, you price a loan with an expected loss build in there. This is
    basically the probability of a default times the loss in event of default: E(loss)=PD*LIED.
    Allowing borrowers to write down their homes through bankruptcy, no matter what
    your motivation, increases both the PD and the LIED. This would lead to higher
    lending rates. If you don''t believe that, then you don''t believe businesses
    try to make money, or that markets are competitive. Lender lobbyists basically
    drove this point home, that this legislation would just kill the current mortgage
    market at an especially sensitive time, and scared 12 Democrats to join the Republicans
    in opposing the Cram-Down.'

    lower mortgage lending, and cratering bank stock prices, via Fannie-backed lending
    to rectify the situation. Every patch needs a fix, which needs a patch, which
    is nice because then everyone has a government job to implement these fixes. Who
    is left to actually make money that pays government salaries, is not her problem.

    sure it will come up again, but at least for now it is dead.
