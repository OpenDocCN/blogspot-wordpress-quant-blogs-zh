    medium-term forecast. The July employment report was stronger, retail sales picked
    up, and overall growth is looking stronger, with Goldman Sachs' GDP tracking estimate
    rising to 2.3% for the third quarter. In addition, equity markets are on firmer
    ground as the crisis in Europe has at least temporarily receded. While certainly
    not exciting, the better tone of the data is palpable. I think the better data
    influenced Atlanta Federal Reserve President Dennis Lockhart to shift his language
    away from his dovish July comments. In short, I would argue that the data since
    the last FOMC meeting has in fact pointed toward an improvement in the pace of
    the recovery, which I think will pull the middle ground back from the brink of
    additional asset purchases.

    Lockhart，使他改变了他在7月份鸽派言论的语气。简而言之，我会认为自上一次FOMC会议以来的数据实际上指向了复苏步伐的改善，我认为这将使中间立场从额外的资产购买边缘拉回来。
